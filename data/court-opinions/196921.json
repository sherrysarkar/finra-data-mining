After  careful\r\n\nreview, we affirm  the district court's dismissal  of Gross's\r\n\nclaims.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          Summa  Four  is  a Delaware  corporation  with  its\r\n\nprincipal place of business in Manchester, New Hampshire.  It\r\n\ndevelops and  manufactures advanced-technology  switching and\r\n\nsignaling  systems  for use  in  telecommunications networks,\r\n\nwhich it markets and distributes to clients worldwide.\r\n\n          On September  23,  1993,  Summa  Four  successfully\r\n\ncompleted  an initial public  offering (\"IPO\") of  its common\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The  individual  defendants  are  Barry  Gorsun,  current\r\npresident, CEO and Chairman  of the Board; James  J. Fiedler,\r\npresident and director from July 1993 through July 1994; John\r\nA.  Shane, director since 1976; William M. Scranton, director\r\nsince 1976; and Robert A. Degan, director since 1984.  Unless\r\notherwise   indicated  we  will   refer  to   all  defendants\r\ncollectively as \"Summa Four\" or \"the company.\"\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nstock.   The individual  defendants sold a  portion of  their\r\n\nshares  into  the IPO  (at a  price  of $17  per  share), but\r\n\nremained significant shareholders following the offering.  As\r\n\nprovided in a  \"lock-up\" agreement with the  underwriter, the\r\n\nindividual  defendants  were  prohibited  from  selling   any\r\n\nretained shares  in the  company for  180 days following  the\r\n\ndate of  the offering.   In late February 1994,  however, the\r\n\nindividual defendants  obtained special  permission from  the\r\n\nunderwriter to sell,  and did  sell, over  130,000 shares  of\r\n\nSumma Four stock  at an average market price in excess of $38\r\n\nper share.    \r\n\n          Gross, who purports to sue on behalf of himself and\r\n\nall other  investors similarly situated, purchased 200 shares\r\n\nof  Summa  Four  stock  in  late  May  1994  at  a  price  of\r\n\napproximately $27.50 per share.  On July 5, 1994 (the closing\r\n\ndate  of the class  period),2 Summa  Four's stock  price fell\r\n\nfrom  $22.25  to  $11.75 per  share  following  the company's\r\n\nannouncement  that its expected results for the first quarter\r\n\nof fiscal year  1995 (ending June 30, 1994)  would fall short\r\n\nof  earlier projections.    Shortly  thereafter,  Summa  Four\r\n\nterminated  defendant James  Fiedler who  had  served as  its\r\n\npresident throughout the class period.\r\n\nA.  Summa Four's Public Statements\r                                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  purported \"class  period\" extends  from  January 18,\r\n1994, to  July 5, 1994.   The district court  never certified\r\nthe class.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          From  January  to  July  1994,  Summa  Four  issued\r                      \r\n\nseveral public  statements touting the  company's performance\r\n\nand  profitability.    In  the  complaint,  Gross  relies  on\r\n\nexcerpts from three  such statements to establish  his claims\r\n\nof securities fraud.   The first two excerpts  are taken from\r\n\npress  releases  dated January  18  and  May  3,  1994,  that\r\n\naccompanied the release of Summa Four's results for the third\r\n\nand  fourth quarters  of its  1994  fiscal year.   The  third\r\n\nexcerpt  is  taken  from  a  June 29,  1994,  letter  to  the\r\n\nshareholders from Summa Four's then president  James Fiedler.\r\n\nThe  June 29  letter was sent  in advance  of the end  of the\r\n\nfirst quarter of Summa Four's 1995 fiscal year.  The relevant\r\n\nportions of the three statements are quoted below.\r\n\n          1.  January 18, 1994, press release: \r\n\n          Competition at all levels and alternative\r\n          technologies caused by divestiture in the\r\n          U.S. and  privatization in  other markets\r\n          are  fueling  growth for  new  customized\r\n          services.   We are also  seeing increased\r                                                               \r\n          demand for our  SDS distributed switch in\r                                                            \r\n          a   number   of   international   markets\r\n          including China, Chile and Columbia where\r\n          there    is    rapid    development    in\r\n          infrastructure.   .   .   .     The   SDS\r\n          distributed   switch   is   becoming  the\r\n          platform of choice for rapidly developing\r\n          and   deploying   network-based  enhanced\r\n          services worldwide.\r\n\n          2.  May 3, 1994, press release:\r\n\n          In the  fourth quarter [ending  March 31,\r\n          1994], the  Company received  significant\r                                                               \r\n          orders  from  AT&amp;T, McCaw,  Sprint,  GTE,\r                            \r\n          Unisys, and IBM to address a broad  range\r\n          of applications . . . .

June 29, 1994, letter to shareholders:\r\n\n          We  are  pleased to  report  to  you that\r\n          fiscal year  1994, ended March  31, 1994,\r\n          was  a  watershed  year  in Summa  Four's\r\n          history.    It  was a  year  in  which we\r\n          strengthened  our  competitive  position,\r\n          recorded our eighth  consecutive increase\r\n          in  quarterly  revenues,   and  generated\r\n          record net income.  \r\n\n          Our  strong   financial  performance   is\r                                                          \r\n          primarily the  result of  our initiatives\r\n          in the  highly competitive  long distance\r\n          market . . .  .  Summa Four is  committed\r\n          to maintaining  its worldwide  leadership\r\n          position  in  the   public  network-based\r\n          distributed  switch  market.     We  have\r\n          preeminent  customers  worldwide,  broad-\r\n          based  strategic  distribution  channels,\r\n          public   network-certified  products,   a\r                                                               \r\n          strong   financial   position,   and   an\r                                                   \r\n          experienced management team. \r\n\n          Gross alleges  that, during the class period, Summa\r\n\nFour possessed internal reports, documents, and board meeting\r\n\nminutes revealing that the company was experiencing declining\r\n\ngrowth in revenue  and earnings, delayed orders,  significant\r\n\nincreases in expenses, and difficulties in  its international\r\n\noperations.   Specifically, in  order to  support his  claims\r\n\nthat the  three public  statements were  materially false  or\r\n\nmisleading, Gross  relies on certain internal \"Flash Reports\"\r\n\nand \"Monthly  Operating Reports\"  for the  months of  January\r\n\nthrough  April  1994,  and recorded  minutes  from  board and\r\n\ninternal operation meetings held in May and June 1994.  As we\r\n\nprogress with our  analysis, we will  discuss in more  detail\r\n\nthe content of these internal documents. \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nB.  The Present Lawsuit\r                                   \r\n\n          On  July  12,  1994,  shortly  after  Summa  Four's\r\n\nannouncement of its expected results for the first quarter of\r\n\nfiscal  year 1995  and the  ensuing sudden  decline in  Summa\r\n\nFour's  stock price, Gross filed this securities fraud action\r\n\nin the New Hampshire federal district court.  Gross purported\r\n\nto  bring  the  complaint  on  behalf  of all  investors  who\r\n\npurchased  Summa   Four  stock   during  the   class  period.\r\n\nFollowing  Summa  Four's  initial  motion   to  dismiss,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  granted  Gross  limited  discovery.     Upon\r\n\ncompletion of that discovery, Gross amended his complaint.  \r\n\n          Subsequently,  Summa  Four  moved  to  dismiss  the\r\n\namended complaint.   After  briefing and  oral argument,  the\r\n\ndistrict court granted  the motion, rejecting all  of Gross's\r\n\nclaims.  The  court disagreed with  Gross that the  excerpted\r\n\nportions of  the statements  could be  viewed as  affirmative\r\n\nmisrepresentations, stating that:\r\n\n          A reasonable person could  not infer from\r\n          the pleaded  acts that demand  for [Summa\r\n          Four's products]  was no  longer growing,\r\n          that  significant  orders  had  not  been\r\n          received from major corporations, or that\r\n          the   company  was   not  in   a  \"strong\r\n          financial position\" simply because it did\r\n          not    meet    its    short-term   budget\r\n          projections,  its  orders for  one  month\r\n          were   lower  than   expected,  and   its\r\n          international operations were  in a state\r\n          of disarray.\r\n\n          The  court also  rejected  Gross's  claim that  the\r\n\nstatements  were misleading  by omission.    The court  noted\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthat, while many  of the facts Gross alleged  to support that\r\n\nallegation  \"might  have  been  important to  the  reasonable\r\n\ninvestor,\"  they were  not sufficient  to  indicate that  the\r\n\nchallenged statements were so incomplete as to be misleading.\r\n\nThe court  further rejected  Gross's final  claim that  Summa\r\n\nFour  had   overstated  its   revenue,  reasoning  that   the\r\n\nallegations  on which Gross relied did not reasonably support\r\n\nthe claim.  Gross now appeals.3\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          Gross  contends that  the  district court  erred in\r\n\ndismissing his claims.  He argues that the amended  complaint\r\n\nadequately  alleged that  Summa  Four had  a  duty, which  it\r\n\nbreached, to  disclose material nonpublic information  in its\r\n\npossession  necessary  to  make  its  public  statements  not\r\n\nmaterially misleading.   Gross also contends that  Summa Four\r\n\nimproperly overstated  its  revenue and  earnings during  the\r\n\nclass period  by not following  generally accepted accounting\r\n\nprinciples (\"GAAP\").  After discussing the standard of review\r\n\nand the  relevant securities  law, we  address each  issue in\r\n\nturn.  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The  amended  complaint  also included  claims  regarding\r\nalleged  misstatements  of  future  performance  and  alleged\r\nmisstatements  by third-party analysts.   Gross has expressly\r\nabandoned those claims on appeal. \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nA.  Standard of Review\r                                  \r\n\n          We review the district court's dismissal of Gross's\r\n\namended   complaint   de   novo,   taking  all   well-pleaded\r                                           \r\n\nallegations  as true  and  giving Gross  the  benefit of  all\r\n\nreasonable inferences.

We  take the claims arising from the\r\n\nJune  29 letter  first, and then  address the  claims arising\r\n\nfrom  the  earlier  January  18 and  May  3  press  releases.\r\n\nFinally, we turn to Gross's claim that, by employing improper\r\n\naccounting  procedures,  Summa  Four  overstated its  revenue\r\n\nduring the class period. \r\n\n          1.  June 29 Letter\r                                        \r\n\n          Gross complains that, given the letter's failure to\r\n\ndisclose Summa Four's  impending poorer-than-expected results\r\n\nfor the  first quarter  of fiscal  year 1995,  its statements\r\n\nthat  the  company   had  experienced  a   \"strong  financial\r\n\nperformance\" and  was in  \"a strong  financial position\"  are\r\n\neither  patently false  or  clearly  misleading by  omission.\r\n\nSumma  Four  disputes  this  contention,  arguing  that  both\r\n\nstatements are completely borne out  by the facts alleged  in\r\n\nthe amended  complaint.  Summa  Four argues that  the \"strong\r\n\nfinancial  performance\"   statement  is   a  backward-looking\r\n\nstatement  referring to  its record  results  in fiscal  year\r\n\n1994.   Summa Four further  adds that nothing in  the amended\r\n\ncomplaint,  viz.,  allegations concerning  its  disappointing\r                            \r\n\nfirst quarter 1995  results, supports the inference  that the\r\n\ncompany was not in a \"strong financial position.\"  \r\n\n          While  the  issues  raised by  the  June  29 letter\r\n\nrepresent,  perhaps, Gross's  strongest  claims, we  need not\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nchoose between  the parties' contrary positions.   Regardless\r\n\nof the merits,  because Gross purchased his stock  on May 27,\r\n\n1994, well  before Summa Four  issued the June 29  letter, he\r\n\nhas no standing to complain  about the statements included in\r\n\nthe letter.

Indeed,\r\n\nwhen  pressed  by  the  district court  on  this  very  issue\r\n\nfollowing  the  limited discovery,  Gross's  counsel conceded\r\n\nthat the amended complaint failed  to point to any \"documents\r\n\nthat  expressly say that on January  18th or thereabouts that\r\n\nthe [SDS] switch  [was] experiencing declining orders.\"   The\r\n\nonly document contemporaneous to the January 18 press release\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nthat Gross  cites to support  his claim, a January  20 \"Flash\r\n\nReport,\" made no comment on any product, or on any particular\r\n\ninternational market.

Such evidence\r\n\nhardly  supports the inference  that the  demand for  the SDS\r\n\nswitch was not increasing in the named international markets.\r\n\n          Moreover, the additional  statement in the  January\r\n\n20  \"Flash Report\" that  Summa Four's  \"overall International\r\n\nsales  and marketing efforts  are currently under  review and\r\n\nwill be revised\"  provides little further support for Gross's\r\n\nclaim.     That  Summa   Four  was   reviewing  its   overall\r\n\ninternational  marketing  efforts  does  not  contradict  the\r\n\nassertion in the January 18 press release that demand for the\r\n\nSDS switch was  increasing in certain areas.

Summa  Four's January  Monthly  Operating Report,  issued\r\nFebruary 25, 1994, states, inter alia, that\r                                                 \r\n\n          [a]   major   reorganization   of   sales\r\n          responsibilities   in    [the   company's\r\n          international operations]  is planned  to\r\n          take  place during March.  It is intended\r\n          to refocus that  organization on European\r\n          opportunities   and   to   emphasize  the\r\n          development of  distribution channels  in\r\n          major  marketplaces  such as  France  and\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\nSee,  e.g.,  Shaw,  82  F.3d  at 1223  (under  Rule  9(b),  a\r                             \r\n\nplaintiff may not  contrast a defendant's past  optimism with\r\n\nless  favorable actual results,  and then simply  contend the\r\n\ndifference is fraud).  None of these later reports or minutes\r\n\nspecifically  reflect on  demand  for the  SDS switch  in the\r\n\nChina,  Chile,   or  Colombia  markets.    More  importantly,\r\n\nalthough   they  arguably   suggest  that   Summa  Four   was\r\n\nexperiencing growing  difficulties in  the management  of its\r\n\ninternational  operations  at  the  time those  documents  or\r\n\nminutes were issued (in late February, April, and June), they\r\n\ndo not adequately support the inference that the company knew\r\n\nof  these difficulties  (or that they  even existed)  when it\r\n\nissued the January 18 press release.\r\n\n          3.

We find\r\n\nGross's arguments unavailing.7\r\n\n          First,  assuming  arguendo that  Gross  has alleged\r                                                \r\n\nsufficiently particular facts to  support the inference  that\r\n\nthe company  knew about the  purported delays at the  time it\r\n\nissued  the May 3 press release, we do not believe that those\r\n\nalleged  delays make  Summa  Four's  statement  that  it  had\r\n\nreceived \"significant orders\" in the prior quarter materially\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  In  the amended complaint, Gross never quotes the portion\r\nof  the challenged statement that expressly indicates that it\r\nrefers  to  orders   received  \"[i]n  the   fourth  quarter.\"\r\nNevertheless,  in reviewing  a  motion  to  dismiss,  we  may\r\nconsider  in its  entirety  a  relevant  document  explicitly\r\nrelied on by the  plaintiff in the  complaint.  See Shaw,  82\r                                                                    \r\nF.3d at 1220; Philip Morris, 75 F.3d at 809. \r                                       \r\n\n7.  Gross also points to an excerpt from the January 18 press\r\nrelease, which noted that Summa Four had received orders from\r\nUnisys, Sprint, IBM, DEC, Pacific  Bell, USWest and AT&amp;T.  We\r\nreject  Gross's  claims  with regard  to  this  statement for\r\nessentially the  same reasons that  we reject his  claim that\r\nthe May 3 statement was materially misleading. \r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nmisleading.  As  Gross acknowledges, the statement  about the\r\n\norders is not false:   Gross does not contend that Summa Four\r\n\ndid   not  receive  the  orders.    Moreover,  the  statement\r\n\nspecifically concerns past events -- the receipt of orders in\r\n\nthe prior quarter.   We have consistently held  that the fact\r\n\nthat a company makes an affirmative true statement about past\r\n\nresults does  not give  rise  to a  duty  to comment  on  its\r\n\ncurrent  status.

For  example, Gross cites Alfus  v. Pyramid\r                                                                         \r\n\nTechnology Corp., 764  F. Supp. 598, 603-04 (N.D.

In\r\n\nAlfus, however, the public statements allegedly undermined by\r                 \r\n\nthe nondisclosed  information were  more specific  statements\r\n\nabout  the company's  revenue  and  earnings potentials  than\r\n\nthose Gross  alleges here.   Where Gross  only points  to two\r\n\npublic statements concerning  past orders  received by  Summa\r\n\nFour, the statements in Alfus dealt with definite projections\r                                         \r\n\n(e.g., \"[W]e forecast total revenue growth of  40 percent, to\r                 \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\n$110-120  million.     We   view  this   as  a   conservative\r\n\nestimate.\").  Id. at 602; see also In re Sunrise Technologies\r                                                                         \r\n\nSec.

In short, we do\r\n\nnot believe that  Gross's allegations that the  company knew,\r\n\nbut failed to  disclose, that it was suffering various delays\r\n\nin closing contracts, receiving orders, and shipping products\r\n\nare sufficient to  support a claim that its  statement in the\r\n\nMay 3 press release about past orders received was materially\r\n\nmisleading.   Furthermore, to  the extent that  the statement\r\n\nthat Summa Four  had received \"significant orders\"  carries a\r\n\npositive implication about the its future success (viz., that\r                                                                   \r\n\nSumma Four received significant  orders last quarter  implies\r\n\nthat  it  would  fill  and  profit  from  those  orders  this\r\n\nquarter), an so might,  arguably, be the basis for  a duty to\r\n\nupdate claim, we think this  statement falls in the  category\r\n\nof  vague and loosely  optimistic statements that  this court\r\n\nhas held  nonactionable as  a matter of  law.   See Glassman,\r                                                                        \r\n\nslip op. at 49-50; Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1217-19.\r                                   \r\n\n          In  any event, the  amended complaint does  not set\r\n\nforth  sufficiently particular  facts  from  which one  could\r\n\nreasonably  infer  that  Summa Four  knew  about  the alleged\r\n\ndelays at the  time it issued the May 3 press release.  Gross\r\n\nfirst points to a March 17 report that stated both that Summa\r\n\nFour had  experienced \"delays in  resolving several  customer\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nissues  and gaining closure  on contracts [that]  caused some\r\n\n[revenue] slippage out of [February]\" and that, due to delays\r\n\nof several  major orders in February, Summa  Four had reduced\r                                                \r\n\nits internal bookings  and revenue forecasts for  the quarter\r\n\nending  March 31,  1994.   Both  of these  excerpts, however,\r\n\nspeak to  events that  occurred in February  1994 and  do not\r\n\nsupport  the  inference  that Summa  Four  was  continuing to\r\n\nexperience  delays  in  May substantial  enough  to  make the\r\n\nstatements in the May 3 press release materially misleading. \r\n\n          Moreover, neither do we believe that the references\r\n\nin the minutes  of the  June 14  board meeting  to delays  in\r\n\norders  that  the  company  was  experiencing  at  that  time\r\n\nsufficiently support the  inference that Summa Four  was (and\r\n\nknew  that it was) experiencing the  alleged delays and other\r\n\ndifficulties at  the time of  the May 3  press release.   The\r\n\nJune 14 board  meeting was held five weeks  after the company\r\n\nissued the  May 3 press  release.  Compare Philip  Morris, 75\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 812  (cannot infer  that company  knew statements  in\r\n\nprospectus  concerning retail sales  were false when  made on\r\n\nthe basis  that decline  in sales  was announced  three weeks\r\n\nlater) with Shaw,  82 F.3d at  1224-25 (where prospectus  was\r                            \r\n\nissued just eleven days prior to the  end of the quarter with\r\n\ndisappointing results -- and three weeks prior to  the actual\r\n\ndisclosure of the  disappointing results -- the  proximity in\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ntime, although not sufficient by itself to survive Rule 9(b),\r\n\nprovided some support for the fraud claims).\r\n\n          4.  Overstatement of Revenue\r                                                  \r\n\n          Gross  also  claims  that Summa  Four's  statements\r\n\nregarding  its revenue and  earnings during the  class period\r\n\nwere materially misleading because,  contrary to GAAP,  Summa\r\n\nFour recognized revenue upon receipt of orders rather than on\r\n\nshipment  of  products.   Gross  claims  that  this premature\r\n\nrecognition  of  income  allowed  Summa   Four  to  overstate\r\n\nsignificantly its  revenues  and earnings  during  the  class\r\n\nperiod. \r\n\n          To support this claim, Gross alleges that, although\r\n\nSumma Four typically requires twelve  to twenty weeks to ship\r\n\nits switches  following the  placement of  an order,  Fiedler\r\n\nstated  at a  June 14  board meeting  that the  company could\r\n\ngenerate up  to  $4.7 million  in  new revenues  through  the\r\n\nreceipt of new  orders in the two weeks  remaining before the\r\n\nend of the quarter.   Gross contends that, given the  time it\r\n\ntakes  Summa   Four  to   fill  orders,   the  statement   is\r\n\ninexplicable unless  the company was recognizing revenue upon\r\n\nreceipt of  orders instead  of  upon shipment.   Gross  finds\r\n\nfurther corroboration for this claim in Summa Four's May 1994\r\n\nboard meeting minutes where it is recorded that the company's\r\n\nchief  financial  officer  was  working  on  a  new  \"revenue\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nrecognition  policy\"  that  was to  be  \"more  formalized and\r\n\nsomewhat more restrictive\" than its previous policy.\r\n\n          Though these  contentions  give us  some pause,  we\r\n\nnonetheless agree with  the district court that  Gross failed\r\n\nto   plead  this  claim  with  sufficient  particularity  for\r\n\npurposes  of  Rule  9(b).    As we  have  noted,  \"a  general\r\n\nallegation  that the practices  at issue resulted  in a false\r\n\nreport of company  earnings is not a  sufficiently particular\r\n\nclaim   of   misrepresentation  [to   satisfy   Rule  9(b)].\"\r\n\nSerabian, 24 F.3d at 362 n.5.  In this case, Gross has failed\r                    \r\n\nto allege any  particulars to support his  general allegation\r\n\nof inflated earnings  through the use of  improper accounting\r\n\nmethods.  Specifically, he has  not alleged the amount of the\r\n\nputative overstatement  or  the  net  effect it  had  on  the\r\n\ncompany's earnings.  See Shushany v.

Costs to appellee.\r                                    Costs to appellee.\r                                                     \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  As with the June 29  letter, Gross would have no standing\r\nto assert a securities fraud claim that  Summa Four misstated\r\nits revenue only for the quarter ending June 30, 1994.\r\n\n9.  Gross  also contends  that the  district  court erred  in\r\nrefusing to  consider two  additional affidavits  Gross filed\r\nwith  the court to  accompany his motion  for reconsideration\r\npursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 59(e).  The district court refused\r\nto  consider the additional affidavits, noting that Gross had\r\n\"not  demonstrated that  he  could  not  have  produced  this\r\ninformation in  response to  defendant's motion to  dismiss.\"\r\nIn  that the affidavits address whether the amended complaint\r\nadequately alleged undisclosed facts to support the inference\r\nthat a reasonable investor would have considered Summa Four's\r\npublic  statements  to be  false and  misleading --  an issue\r\nclearly before the court on Summa Four's motion to dismiss --\r\nwe find  no abuse of discretion by  the district court in its\r\nrefusal to consider them.   See, e.g., Williams v. Poulos, 11\r                                                                     \r\nF.3d  271,  289  (1st  Cir.  1993)  (reconsideration  rulings\r\nreviewed only for abuse of discretion). \r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n",

Gross further complains that Summa Four improperly overstated its revenue during the same time period.  After careful review, we affirm the district court's dismissal of Gross's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summa Four is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Manchester, New Hampshire.  It develops and manufactures advanced-technology switching and signaling systems for use in telecommunications networks, which it markets and distributes to clients worldwide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 23, 1993, Summa Four successfully completed an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of its common stock.  The individual defendants sold a portion of their shares into the IPO (at a price of $17 per share), but remained significant shareholders following the offering.  As provided in a \"lock-up\" agreement with the underwriter, the individual defendants were prohibited from selling any retained shares in the company for 180 days following the date of the offering.  In late February 1994, however, the individual defendants obtained special permission from the underwriter to sell, and did sell, over 130,000 shares of Summa Four stock at an average market price in excess of $38 per share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross, who purports to sue on behalf of himself and all other investors similarly situated, purchased 200 shares of Summa Four stock in late May 1994 at a price of approximately $27.50 per share.  On July 5, 1994 (the closing date of the class period),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Summa Four's stock price fell from $22.25 to $11.75 per share following the company's announcement that its expected results for the first quarter of fiscal year 1995 (ending June 30, 1994) would fall short of earlier projections.  Shortly thereafter, Summa Four terminated defendant James Fiedler who had served as its president throughout the class period.A. Summa Four's Public Statements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From January to July 1994, Summa Four issued several public statements touting the company's performance and profitability.  In the complaint, Gross relies on excerpts from three such statements to establish his claims of securities fraud.  The first two excerpts are taken from press releases dated January 18 and May 3, 1994, that accompanied the release of Summa Four's results for the third and fourth quarters of its 1994 fiscal year.  The third excerpt is taken from a June 29, 1994, letter to the shareholders from Summa Four's then president James Fiedler.  The June 29 letter was sent in advance of the end of the first quarter of Summa Four's 1995 fiscal year.  The relevant portions of the three statements are quoted below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. January 18, 1994, press release:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Competition at all levels and alternative technologies caused by divestiture in the U.S. and privatization in other markets are fueling growth for new customized services.  We are also seeing increased demand for our SDS distributed switch in a number of international markets including China, Chile and Columbia where there is rapid development in infrastructure....  The SDS distributed switch is becoming the platform of choice for rapidly developing and deploying network-based enhanced services worldwide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. May 3, 1994, press release:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>In the fourth quarter [ending March 31, 1994], the Company received significant orders from AT &amp; T, McCaw, Sprint, GTE, Unisys, and IBM to address a broad range of applications....  These new orders were for both new and existing applications, domestically and internationally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. June 29, 1994, letter to shareholders:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>We are pleased to report to you that fiscal year 1994, ended March 31, 1994, was a watershed year in Summa Four's history.  It was a year in which we strengthened our competitive position, recorded our eighth consecutive increase in quarterly revenues, and generated record net income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>Our strong financial performance is primarily the result of our initiatives in the highly competitive long distance market....  Summa Four is committed to maintaining its worldwide leadership position in the public network-based distributed switch market.  We have preeminent customers worldwide, broad-based strategic distribution channels, public network-certified products, a strong financial position, and an experienced management team.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross alleges that, during the class period, Summa Four possessed internal reports, documents, and board meeting minutes revealing that the company was experiencing declining growth in revenue and earnings, delayed orders, significant increases in expenses, and difficulties in its international operations.  Specifically, in order to support his claims that the three public statements were materially false or misleading, Gross relies on certain internal \"Flash Reports\" and \"Monthly Operating Reports\" for the months of January through April 1994, and recorded minutes from board and internal operation meetings held in May and June 1994.  As we progress with our analysis, we will discuss in more detail the content of these internal documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Present Lawsuit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 12, 1994, shortly after Summa Four's announcement of its expected results for the first quarter of fiscal year 1995 and the ensuing sudden decline in Summa Four's stock price, Gross filed this securities fraud action in the New Hampshire federal district court.  Gross purported to bring the complaint on behalf of all investors who purchased Summa Four stock during the class period.  Following Summa Four's initial motion to dismiss, the district court granted Gross limited discovery.  Upon completion of that discovery, Gross amended his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Summa Four moved to dismiss the amended complaint.  After briefing and oral argument, the district court granted the motion, rejecting all of Gross's claims.  The court disagreed with Gross that the excerpted portions of the statements could be viewed as affirmative misrepresentations, stating that:A reasonable person could not infer from the pleaded acts that demand for [Summa Four's products] was no longer growing, that significant orders had not been received from major corporations, or that the company was not in a \"strong financial position\" simply because it did not meet its short-term budget projections, its orders for one month were lower than expected, and its international operations were in a state of disarray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also rejected Gross's claim that the statements were misleading by omission.  The court noted that, while many of the facts Gross alleged to support that allegation \"might have been important to the reasonable investor,\" they were not sufficient to indicate that the challenged statements were so incomplete as to be misleading.  The court further rejected Gross's final claim that Summa Four had overstated its revenue, reasoning that the allegations on which Gross relied did not reasonably support the claim.  Gross now appeals.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross contends that the district court erred in dismissing his claims.  He argues that the amended complaint adequately alleged that Summa Four had a duty, which it breached, to disclose material nonpublic information in its possession necessary to make its public statements not materially misleading.  Gross also contends that Summa Four improperly overstated its revenue and earnings during the class period by not following generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").  After discussing the standard of review and the relevant securities law, we address each issue in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's dismissal of Gross's amended complaint de novo, taking all well-pleaded allegations as true and giving Gross the benefit of all reasonable inferences.  See Roeder v. Alpha Indus., Inc., 814 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1987).  Nonetheless, because Gross alleges fraud, he is subject to the heightened pleading requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), which provides that \"[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting the fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 9(b) sets a demanding standard in order to \"minimize the chance that a plaintiff with a largely groundless claim will bring a suit and conduct extensive discovery in the hopes of obtaining an increased settlement, rather than in the hopes that the process will reveal relevant evidence.\"  Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 929 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir.1991) (internal quotations and citations omitted).  We have been especially strict in demanding adherence to Rule 9(b) in the securities context, id., expressly stating that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>\"general averments of defendants' knowledge of material falsity will not suffice.  Consistent with Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b), the complaint must set forth specific facts that make it reasonable to believe that the defendant[s] knew that a statement was materially false or misleading.  The rule requires that the particular times, dates, places, or other details of the alleged fraudulent involvement of the actors be alleged.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lucia v. Prospect St. High Income Portfolio, 36 F.3d 170, 174 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 361 (1st Cir.1994)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, we have consistently held that a securities plaintiff does not satisfy the requirements of Rule 9(b) merely by pleading \" 'fraud by hindsight.' \"  Greenstone v. Cambex Corp., 975 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Denny v. Barber, 576 F.2d 465, 470 (2d Cir.1978)).  In other words, \"a general averment that defendants 'knew' earlier what later turned out badly\" does not convey the necessary particularity that Rule 9(b) requires.  Id.  In addition, the heightened pleading requirement of Rule 9(b) applies even when the fraud relates to matters peculiarly within the defendant's knowledge. Lucia, 36 F.3d at 174;  Romani, 929 F.2d at 878.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Requirements of a 10b-5 Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross bases his fraud claims on alleged violations of &#167; 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.  15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b);  17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5.  Together these provisions prohibit any person, directly or indirectly, from committing fraud in connection with the purchase or sale of securities.  Id.; Shaw v. Digital Equip.  Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1217 (1st Cir.1996).  To state a cause of action under &#167; 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must plead, with sufficient particularity, that the defendant made a false statement or omitted a material fact, with the requisite scienter, and that the plaintiff's reliance on this statement or omission caused the plaintiff's injury.  Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1217;  see also San Leandro Emergency Medical Group Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Cos., 75 F.3d 801, 808 (2d Cir.1996).  A misrepresented or omitted fact will be considered material only if a reasonable investor would have viewed the misrepresentation or omission as \"having significantly altered the total mix of information made available.\"  Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 232, 108 S.Ct. 978, 983, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By itself, however, Rule 10b-5, does not create an affirmative duty of disclosure.  Indeed, a corporation does not commit securities fraud merely by failing to disclose all nonpublic material information in its possession.  Roeder, 814 F.2d at 26 (citing Chiarella v. United States, 445 U.S. 222, 235, 100 S.Ct. 1108, 1118, 63 L.Ed.2d 348 (1980));  see also Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1202.   The corporation must first have a duty to disclose the nonpublic material information before the potential for any liability under the securities laws emerges.  Roeder, 814 F.2d at 26.   Such a duty may arise if, inter alia, a corporation has previously made a statement of material fact that is either false, inaccurate, incomplete, or misleading in light of the undisclosed information.  See id. at 27.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, \"[w]hen a corporation does make a disclosure--whether it be voluntary or required--there is a duty to make it complete and accurate.\"  Id. at 26.  \"This, however, does not mean that by revealing one fact about a product, one must reveal all others that, too, would be interesting, market-wise, but means only such others, if any, that are needed so that what was revealed would not be 'so incomplete as to mislead.' \"  Backman v. Polaroid Corp., 910 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir.1990) (en banc ) (quoting SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 862 (2d Cir.1968) (en banc ), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 976, 89 S.Ct. 1454, 22 L.Ed.2d 756 (1969)).  Furthermore, the fact that a company has reported accurately about past successes does not by itself burden the company with a duty to inform the market that present circumstances are less positive.  Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1202;  Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 361 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to Gross's claims that Summa Four's various public statements during the class period were either false and misleading in and of themselves or false and misleading by omission.  We take the claims arising from the June 29 letter first, and then address the claims arising from the earlier January 18 and May 3 press releases.  Finally, we turn to Gross's claim that, by employing improper accounting procedures, Summa Four overstated its revenue during the class period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. June 29 Letter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross complains that, given the letter's failure to disclose Summa Four's impending poorer-than-expected results for the first quarter of fiscal year 1995, its statements that the company had experienced a \"strong financial performance\" and was in \"a strong financial position\" are either patently false or clearly misleading by omission.  Summa Four disputes this contention, arguing that both statements are completely borne out by the facts alleged in the amended complaint.  Summa Four argues that the \"strong financial performance\" statement is a backward-looking statement referring to its record results in fiscal year 1994.  Summa Four further adds that nothing in the amended complaint, viz., allegations concerning its disappointing first quarter 1995 results, supports the inference that the company was not in a \"strong financial position.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the issues raised by the June 29 letter represent, perhaps, Gross's strongest claims, we need not choose between the parties' contrary positions.  Regardless of the merits, because Gross purchased his stock on May 27, 1994, well before Summa Four issued the June 29 letter, he has no standing to complain about the statements included in the letter.  See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1222 (only individuals who purchased shares after allegedly misleading statement could have suffered a cognizable injury);  Roots Partnership v. Lands' End, Inc., 965 F.2d 1411, 1420 (7th Cir.1992) (similar).  In other words, because Summa Four issued the letter after Gross had purchased his stock, the statements in the letter could not possibly have inflated the market price that he paid for those shares.  Roots Partnership, 965 F.2d at 1420.   Moreover, although Gross purports to bring a class action on behalf of all individuals who purchased Summa Four shares during the class period, he cannot maintain an action on behalf of class members to redress an injury for which he has no standing in his own right.  Id. at 1420 n. 6;  see Britt v. McKenney, 529 F.2d 44, 45 (1st Cir.)  (\"If none of the named plaintiffs may maintain action on their own behalf, they may not seek such relief on behalf of a class.\"), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 854, 97 S.Ct. 149, 50 L.Ed.2d 130 (1976);  see also Lewis v. Casey, --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 2181-83, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. January 18 Press Release:  False Statement of Current Facts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from the claims arising from the June 29 letter, Gross points to one statement excerpted from the January 18, 1994, press release as constituting a false statement of current facts.  Gross contends that the amended complaint sufficiently alleged that Summa Four's statement that \"We are seeing increased demand for our SDS distributed switch in a number of international markets including China, Chile and Colombia\" is patently false and a violation of Rule 10b-5.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though Gross adamantly contends that the statement is false, the amended complaint provides little in the way of specific facts to support this contention.  See Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 25 (\"complaint must set forth specific facts that make it reasonable to believe that the defendant knew that a statement was materially false or misleading\");  see also Glassman v. Computervision Corp., 90 F.3d 617, 630 (1st Cir. 1996) (complaint failed to allege sufficient factual basis for claim that up-to-date information was ignored in setting offering prices).  Indeed, when pressed by the district court on this very issue following the limited discovery, Gross's counsel conceded that the amended complaint failed to point to any \"documents that expressly say that on January 18th or thereabouts that the [SDS] switch [was] experiencing declining orders.\"   The only document contemporaneous to the January 18 press release that Gross cites to support his claim, a January 20 \"Flash Report,\" made no comment on any product, or on any particular international market.  At best, the January 20 \"Flash Report\" revealed that Summa Four had experienced some slight negative variances from its overall budgeted revenues and costs for the reporting period ending December 31, 1993.  Such evidence hardly supports the inference that the demand for the SDS switch was not increasing in the named international markets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the additional statement in the January 20 \"Flash Report\" that Summa Four's \"overall International sales and marketing efforts are currently under review and will be revised\" provides little further support for Gross's claim.  That Summa Four was reviewing its overall international marketing efforts does not contradict the assertion in the January 18 press release that demand for the SDS switch was increasing in certain areas.  Neither do the later reports and meeting minutes adverted to in the amended complaint adequately support the inference that the excerpt from the January 18 press release was false when made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1223 (under Rule 9(b), a plaintiff may not contrast a defendant's past optimism with less favorable actual results, and then simply contend the difference is fraud).  None of these later reports or minutes specifically reflect on demand for the SDS switch in the China, Chile, or Colombia markets.  More importantly, although they arguably suggest that Summa Four was experiencing growing difficulties in the management of its international operations at the time those documents or minutes were issued (in late February, April, and June), they do not adequately support the inference that the company knew of these difficulties (or that they even existed) when it issued the January 18 press release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. May 3 Press Release:  Misleading Omissions of Current Facts</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross also contends that Summa Four made several technically accurate statements about its receipt of orders without disclosing facts known to the company that were necessary to make the disclosed statements not misleading.  Gross points principally to an excerpt from the May 3 press release, stating that \"[i]n the fourth quarter [ending March 31, 1994], the Company [had] received significant orders from AT &amp; T, McCaw, Sprint, GTE, Unisys, and IBM to address a broad range of applications.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Gross contends that this statement was materially misleading because Summa Four did not also tell investors that, at that time, it was experiencing delays in consummating contracts for at least one of these orders, in receiving other orders, and in shipping products.  We find Gross's arguments unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, assuming arguendo that Gross has alleged sufficiently particular facts to support the inference that the company knew about the purported delays at the time it issued the May 3 press release, we do not believe that those alleged delays make Summa Four's statement that it had received \"significant orders\" in the prior quarter materially misleading.  As Gross acknowledges, the statement about the orders is not false:  Gross does not contend that Summa Four did not receive the orders.  Moreover, the statement specifically concerns past events--the receipt of orders in the prior quarter.  We have consistently held that the fact that a company makes an affirmative true statement about past results does not give rise to a duty to comment on its current status.  Serabian, 24 F.3d at 361;   Capri Optics Profit Sharing v. Digital Equip.  Corp., 950 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the cases on which Gross relies for the proposition that the failure to disclose information similar to that alleged here was a material omission are clearly distinguishable.  For example, Gross cites Alfus v. Pyramid Technology Corp., 764 F.Supp. 598, 603-04 (N.D.Cal.1991), as holding that a company's failure to disclose, inter alia, \"manufacturing delays\" and \"flattening sales\" was an omission sufficient to survive the company's motion to dismiss.  In Alfus, however, the public statements allegedly undermined by the nondisclosed information were more specific statements about the company's revenue and earnings potentials than those Gross alleges here.  Where Gross only points to two public statements concerning past orders received by Summa Four, the statements in Alfus dealt with definite projections (e.g., \"[W]e forecast total revenue growth of 40 percent, to $110-120 million.  We view this as a conservative estimate.\").  Id. at 602;  see also In re Sunrise Technologies Sec. Litig., [1992 Transfer Binder] Fed.  Sec. L. Rep.  (CCH) p 97,042 (N.D.Cal. Sept. 22, 1992) (similar).  In short, we do not believe that Gross's allegations that the company knew, but failed to disclose, that it was suffering various delays in closing contracts, receiving orders, and shipping products are sufficient to support a claim that its statement in the May 3 press release about past orders received was materially misleading.  Furthermore, to the extent that the statement that Summa Four had received \"significant orders\" carries a positive implication about its future success (viz., that Summa Four received significant orders last quarter implies that it would fill and profit from those orders this quarter), and so might, arguably, be the basis for a duty to update claim, we think this statement falls in the category of vague and loosely optimistic statements that this court has held nonactionable as a matter of law.  See Glassman, 90 F.3d at 635;  Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1217-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the amended complaint does not set forth sufficiently particular facts from which one could reasonably infer that Summa Four knew about the alleged delays at the time it issued the May 3 press release.  Gross first points to a March 17 report that stated both that Summa Four had experienced \"delays in resolving several customer issues and gaining closure on contracts [that] caused some [revenue] slippage out of [February]\" and that, due to delays of several major orders in February, Summa Four had reduced its internal bookings and revenue forecasts for the quarter ending March 31, 1994.  Both of these excerpts, however, speak to events that occurred in February 1994 and do not support the inference that Summa Four was continuing to experience delays in May substantial enough to make the statements in the May 3 press release materially misleading.  Moreover, neither do we believe that the references in the minutes of the June 14 board meeting to delays in orders that the company was experiencing at that time sufficiently support the inference that Summa Four was (and knew that it was) experiencing the alleged delays and other difficulties at the time of the May 3 press release.  The June 14 board meeting was held five weeks after the company issued the May 3 press release.  Compare Philip Morris, 75 F.3d at 812 (cannot infer that company knew statements in prospectus concerning retail sales were false when made on the basis that decline in sales was announced three weeks later) with Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1224-25 (where prospectus was issued just eleven days prior to the end of the quarter with disappointing results--and three weeks prior to the actual disclosure of the disappointing results--the proximity in time, although not sufficient by itself to survive Rule 9(b), provided some support for the fraud claims).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Overstatement of Revenue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross also claims that Summa Four's statements regarding its revenue and earnings during the class period were materially misleading because, contrary to GAAP, Summa Four recognized revenue upon receipt of orders rather than on shipment of products.  Gross claims that this premature recognition of income allowed Summa Four to overstate significantly its revenues and earnings during the class period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support this claim, Gross alleges that, although Summa Four typically requires twelve to twenty weeks to ship its switches following the placement of an order, Fiedler stated at a June 14 board meeting that the company could generate up to $4.7 million in new revenues through the receipt of new orders in the two weeks remaining before the end of the quarter.  Gross contends that, given the time it takes Summa Four to fill orders, the statement is inexplicable unless the company was recognizing revenue upon receipt of orders instead of upon shipment.  Gross finds further corroboration for this claim in Summa Four's May 1994 board meeting minutes where it is recorded that the company's chief financial officer was working on a new \"revenue recognition policy\" that was to be \"more formalized and somewhat more restrictive\" than its previous policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though these contentions give us some pause, we nonetheless agree with the district court that Gross failed to plead this claim with sufficient particularity for purposes of Rule 9(b).  As we have noted, \"a general allegation that the practices at issue resulted in a false report of company earnings is not a sufficiently particular claim of misrepresentation [to satisfy Rule 9(b) ].\"  Serabian, 24 F.3d at 362 n. 5.   In this case, Gross has failed to allege any particulars to support his general allegation of inflated earnings through the use of improper accounting methods.  Specifically, he has not alleged the amount of the putative overstatement or the net effect it had on the company's earnings.  See Shushany v. Allwaste, Inc., 992 F.2d 517, 522 (5th Cir.1993) (allegation that company had adjusted the accounting of its inventory to inflate revenues and earnings does not sufficiently plead fraud where complaint does not explain, inter alia, how the adjustments affected the company's financial statements and whether they were material in light of the company's overall financial position);  Roots Partnership, 965 F.2d at 1419 (allegation that company \"failed to establish adequate reserves for its excessive and outdated inventory\" does not satisfy Rule 9(b) where investor does not allege \"what the reserves were or suggest how great the reserves should have been\");  Decker v. Massey-Ferguson, Ltd., 681 F.2d 111, 116 (2d Cir.1982) (allegation that company's failure to write down value of obsolete equipment does not sufficiently plead fraud where plaintiff did not allege amounts at which equipment was carried--or should have been carried--on company's books);  Schick v. Ernst &amp; Young, 141 F.R.D. 23, 27 (S.D.N.Y.1992) (allegations that accountants \"significantly overstated\" assets of company in prospectus did not adequately particularize the alleged misrepresentations and omissions where plaintiff failed to allege the amount of the purported overstatement);  cf. Cohen v. Koenig, 25 F.3d 1168, 1173 (2d Cir.1994) (fraud pleaded with sufficient particularity by setting out representations made, what financial figures they were given, and what they alleged to be the true financial figures).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the single statement by Fiedler during the minutes of the June 14 board meeting is far too tenuous a foundation (at least for Rule 9(b) purposes) to support Gross's claim that Summa Four had fraudulently overstated its revenue.  Arguably, the statement supports a reasonable inference that the company, or at least Fiedler, may have contemplated booking revenue upon the receipt of orders rather than shipment for the quarter ending on June 30, 1994;  however, we do not think that the statement, by itself, is sufficient to indicate that the company had actually booked as revenue sales instead of shipments in any previous quarter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Moreover, we do not think the ambiguous statements taken from the minutes of the May 1994 board meeting concerning review of the company's accounting system corroborate Fiedler's June 14 statement sufficiently to overcome the deficiencies in Gross's pleadings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.

Gross further complains that Summa Four improperly overstated its revenue during the same time period.  After careful review, we affirm the district court's dismissal of Gross's claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summa Four is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Manchester, New Hampshire.  It develops and manufactures advanced-technology switching and signaling systems for use in telecommunications networks, which it markets and distributes to clients worldwide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 23, 1993, Summa Four successfully completed an initial public offering (\"IPO\") of its common stock.  The individual defendants sold a portion of their shares into the IPO (at a price of $17 per share), but remained significant shareholders following the offering.  As provided in a \"lock-up\" agreement with the underwriter, the individual defendants were prohibited from selling any retained shares in the company for 180 days following the date of the offering.  In late February 1994, however, the individual defendants obtained special permission from the underwriter to sell, and did sell, over 130,000 shares of Summa Four stock at an average market price in excess of $38 per share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross, who purports to sue on behalf of himself and all other investors similarly situated, purchased 200 shares of Summa Four stock in late May 1994 at a price of approximately $27.50 per share.  On July 5, 1994 (the closing date of the class period),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Summa Four's stock price fell from $22.25 to $11.75 per share following the company's announcement that its expected results for the first quarter of fiscal year 1995 (ending June 30, 1994) would fall short of earlier projections.  Shortly thereafter, Summa Four terminated defendant James Fiedler who had served as its president throughout the class period.A. Summa Four's Public Statements</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From January to July 1994, Summa Four issued several public statements touting the company's performance and profitability.  In the complaint, Gross relies on excerpts from three such statements to establish his claims of securities fraud.  The first two excerpts are taken from press releases dated January 18 and May 3, 1994, that accompanied the release of Summa Four's results for the third and fourth quarters of its 1994 fiscal year.  The third excerpt is taken from a June 29, 1994, letter to the shareholders from Summa Four's then president James Fiedler.  The June 29 letter was sent in advance of the end of the first quarter of Summa Four's 1995 fiscal year.  The relevant portions of the three statements are quoted below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. January 18, 1994, press release:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Competition at all levels and alternative technologies caused by divestiture in the U.S. and privatization in other markets are fueling growth for new customized services.  We are also seeing increased demand for our SDS distributed switch in a number of international markets including China, Chile and Columbia where there is rapid development in infrastructure....  The SDS distributed switch is becoming the platform of choice for rapidly developing and deploying network-based enhanced services worldwide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. May 3, 1994, press release:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>In the fourth quarter [ending March 31, 1994], the Company received significant orders from AT &amp; T, McCaw, Sprint, GTE, Unisys, and IBM to address a broad range of applications....  These new orders were for both new and existing applications, domestically and internationally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. June 29, 1994, letter to shareholders:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>We are pleased to report to you that fiscal year 1994, ended March 31, 1994, was a watershed year in Summa Four's history.  It was a year in which we strengthened our competitive position, recorded our eighth consecutive increase in quarterly revenues, and generated record net income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>Our strong financial performance is primarily the result of our initiatives in the highly competitive long distance market....  Summa Four is committed to maintaining its worldwide leadership position in the public network-based distributed switch market.  We have preeminent customers worldwide, broad-based strategic distribution channels, public network-certified products, a strong financial position, and an experienced management team.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross alleges that, during the class period, Summa Four possessed internal reports, documents, and board meeting minutes revealing that the company was experiencing declining growth in revenue and earnings, delayed orders, significant increases in expenses, and difficulties in its international operations.  Specifically, in order to support his claims that the three public statements were materially false or misleading, Gross relies on certain internal \"Flash Reports\" and \"Monthly Operating Reports\" for the months of January through April 1994, and recorded minutes from board and internal operation meetings held in May and June 1994.  As we progress with our analysis, we will discuss in more detail the content of these internal documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Present Lawsuit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 12, 1994, shortly after Summa Four's announcement of its expected results for the first quarter of fiscal year 1995 and the ensuing sudden decline in Summa Four's stock price, Gross filed this securities fraud action in the New Hampshire federal district court.  Gross purported to bring the complaint on behalf of all investors who purchased Summa Four stock during the class period.  Following Summa Four's initial motion to dismiss, the district court granted Gross limited discovery.  Upon completion of that discovery, Gross amended his complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, Summa Four moved to dismiss the amended complaint.  After briefing and oral argument, the district court granted the motion, rejecting all of Gross's claims.  The court disagreed with Gross that the excerpted portions of the statements could be viewed as affirmative misrepresentations, stating that:A reasonable person could not infer from the pleaded acts that demand for [Summa Four's products] was no longer growing, that significant orders had not been received from major corporations, or that the company was not in a \"strong financial position\" simply because it did not meet its short-term budget projections, its orders for one month were lower than expected, and its international operations were in a state of disarray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also rejected Gross's claim that the statements were misleading by omission.  The court noted that, while many of the facts Gross alleged to support that allegation \"might have been important to the reasonable investor,\" they were not sufficient to indicate that the challenged statements were so incomplete as to be misleading.  The court further rejected Gross's final claim that Summa Four had overstated its revenue, reasoning that the allegations on which Gross relied did not reasonably support the claim.

Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn first to Gross's claims that Summa Four's various public statements during the class period were either false and misleading in and of themselves or false and misleading by omission.  We take the claims arising from the June 29 letter first, and then address the claims arising from the earlier January 18 and May 3 press releases.  Finally, we turn to Gross's claim that, by employing improper accounting procedures, Summa Four overstated its revenue during the class period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. June 29 Letter</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross complains that, given the letter's failure to disclose Summa Four's impending poorer-than-expected results for the first quarter of fiscal year 1995, its statements that the company had experienced a \"strong financial performance\" and was in \"a strong financial position\" are either patently false or clearly misleading by omission.  Summa Four disputes this contention, arguing that both statements are completely borne out by the facts alleged in the amended complaint.  Summa Four argues that the \"strong financial performance\" statement is a backward-looking statement referring to its record results in fiscal year 1994.  Summa Four further adds that nothing in the amended complaint, viz., allegations concerning its disappointing first quarter 1995 results, supports the inference that the company was not in a \"strong financial position.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the issues raised by the June 29 letter represent, perhaps, Gross's strongest claims, we need not choose between the parties' contrary positions.  Regardless of the merits, because Gross purchased his stock on May 27, 1994, well before Summa Four issued the June 29 letter, he has no standing to complain about the statements included in the letter.  See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1222 (only individuals who purchased shares after allegedly misleading statement could have suffered a cognizable injury);  Roots Partnership v. Lands' End, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584165\"><a href=\"/opinion/584165/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96633-the-roots-partnership-individually-and-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1411</span></a></span>, 1420 (7th Cir.1992) (similar).  In other words, because Summa Four issued the letter after Gross had purchased his stock, the statements in the letter could not possibly have inflated the market price that he paid for those shares.  Roots Partnership, 965 F.2d at 1420.   Moreover, although Gross purports to bring a class action on behalf of all individuals who purchased Summa Four shares during the class period, he cannot maintain an action on behalf of class members to redress an injury for which he has no standing in his own right.

Gross contends that the amended complaint sufficiently alleged that Summa Four's statement that \"We are seeing increased demand for our SDS distributed switch in a number of international markets including China, Chile and Colombia\" is patently false and a violation of Rule 10b-5.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though Gross adamantly contends that the statement is false, the amended complaint provides little in the way of specific facts to support this contention.  See Greenstone, 975 F.2d at 25 (\"complaint must set forth specific facts that make it reasonable to believe that the defendant knew that a statement was materially false or misleading\");  see also Glassman v. Computervision Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196899\"><a href=\"/opinion/196899/glassman-v-computervision/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span>, 630 (1st Cir. 1996) (complaint failed to allege sufficient factual basis for claim that up-to-date information was ignored in setting offering prices).  Indeed, when pressed by the district court on this very issue following the limited discovery, Gross's counsel conceded that the amended complaint failed to point to any \"documents that expressly say that on January 18th or thereabouts that the [SDS] switch [was] experiencing declining orders.\"   The only document contemporaneous to the January 18 press release that Gross cites to support his claim, a January 20 \"Flash Report,\" made no comment on any product, or on any particular international market.  At best, the January 20 \"Flash Report\" revealed that Summa Four had experienced some slight negative variances from its overall budgeted revenues and costs for the reporting period ending December 31, 1993.  Such evidence hardly supports the inference that the demand for the SDS switch was not increasing in the named international markets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the additional statement in the January 20 \"Flash Report\" that Summa Four's \"overall International sales and marketing efforts are currently under review and will be revised\" provides little further support for Gross's claim.  That Summa Four was reviewing its overall international marketing efforts does not contradict the assertion in the January 18 press release that demand for the SDS switch was increasing in certain areas.  Neither do the later reports and meeting minutes adverted to in the amended complaint adequately support the inference that the excerpt from the January 18 press release was false when made.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1223 (under Rule 9(b), a plaintiff may not contrast a defendant's past optimism with less favorable actual results, and then simply contend the difference is fraud).  None of these later reports or minutes specifically reflect on demand for the SDS switch in the China, Chile, or Colombia markets.  More importantly, although they arguably suggest that Summa Four was experiencing growing difficulties in the management of its international operations at the time those documents or minutes were issued (in late February, April, and June), they do not adequately support the inference that the company knew of these difficulties (or that they even existed) when it issued the January 18 press release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

Gross points principally to an excerpt from the May 3 press release, stating that \"[i]n the fourth quarter [ending March 31, 1994], the Company [had] received significant orders from AT &amp; T, McCaw, Sprint, GTE, Unisys, and IBM to address a broad range of applications.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Gross contends that this statement was materially misleading because Summa Four did not also tell investors that, at that time, it was experiencing delays in consummating contracts for at least one of these orders, in receiving other orders, and in shipping products.  We find Gross's arguments unavailing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, assuming arguendo that Gross has alleged sufficiently particular facts to support the inference that the company knew about the purported delays at the time it issued the May 3 press release, we do not believe that those alleged delays make Summa Four's statement that it had received \"significant orders\" in the prior quarter materially misleading.  As Gross acknowledges, the statement about the orders is not false:  Gross does not contend that Summa Four did not receive the orders.  Moreover, the statement specifically concerns past events--the receipt of orders in the prior quarter.  We have consistently held that the fact that a company makes an affirmative true statement about past results does not give rise to a duty to comment on its current status.  Serabian, 24 F.3d at 361;   Capri Optics Profit Sharing v. Digital Equip.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572651\"><a href=\"/opinion/572651/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96415-capri-optics-profit-sharing-v-digital-equipment/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the cases on which Gross relies for the proposition that the failure to disclose information similar to that alleged here was a material omission are clearly distinguishable.  For example, Gross cites Alfus v. Pyramid Technology Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></span>, 603-04 (N.D.Cal.1991), as holding that a company's failure to disclose, inter alia, \"manufacturing delays\" and \"flattening sales\" was an omission sufficient to survive the company's motion to dismiss.  In Alfus, however, the public statements allegedly undermined by the nondisclosed information were more specific statements about the company's revenue and earnings potentials than those Gross alleges here.  Where Gross only points to two public statements concerning past orders received by Summa Four, the statements in Alfus dealt with definite projections (e.g., \"[W]e forecast total revenue growth of 40 percent, to $110-120 million.  We view this as a conservative estimate.\").  Id. at 602;  see also In re Sunrise Technologies Sec. Litig., [1992 Transfer Binder] Fed.  Sec. L. Rep.  (CCH) p 97,042 (N.D.Cal. Sept. 22, 1992) (similar).  In short, we do not believe that Gross's allegations that the company knew, but failed to disclose, that it was suffering various delays in closing contracts, receiving orders, and shipping products are sufficient to support a claim that its statement in the May 3 press release about past orders received was materially misleading.  Furthermore, to the extent that the statement that Summa Four had received \"significant orders\" carries a positive implication about its future success (viz., that Summa Four received significant orders last quarter implies that it would fill and profit from those orders this quarter), and so might, arguably, be the basis for a duty to update claim, we think this statement falls in the category of vague and loosely optimistic statements that this court has held nonactionable as a matter of law.  See Glassman, 90 F.3d at 635;  Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1217-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the amended complaint does not set forth sufficiently particular facts from which one could reasonably infer that Summa Four knew about the alleged delays at the time it issued the May 3 press release.  Gross first points to a March 17 report that stated both that Summa Four had experienced \"delays in resolving several customer issues and gaining closure on contracts [that] caused some [revenue] slippage out of [February]\" and that, due to delays of several major orders in February, Summa Four had reduced its internal bookings and revenue forecasts for the quarter ending March 31, 1994.  Both of these excerpts, however, speak to events that occurred in February 1994 and do not support the inference that Summa Four was continuing to experience delays in May substantial enough to make the statements in the May 3 press release materially misleading.  Moreover, neither do we believe that the references in the minutes of the June 14 board meeting to delays in orders that the company was experiencing at that time sufficiently support the inference that Summa Four was (and knew that it was) experiencing the alleged delays and other difficulties at the time of the May 3 press release.  The June 14 board meeting was held five weeks after the company issued the May 3 press release.  Compare Philip Morris, 75 F.3d at 812 (cannot infer that company knew statements in prospectus concerning retail sales were false when made on the basis that decline in sales was announced three weeks later) with Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1224-25 (where prospectus was issued just eleven days prior to the end of the quarter with disappointing results--and three weeks prior to the actual disclosure of the disappointing results--the proximity in time, although not sufficient by itself to survive Rule 9(b), provided some support for the fraud claims).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Overstatement of Revenue</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gross also claims that Summa Four's statements regarding its revenue and earnings during the class period were materially misleading because, contrary to GAAP, Summa Four recognized revenue upon receipt of orders rather than on shipment of products.  Gross claims that this premature recognition of income allowed Summa Four to overstate significantly its revenues and earnings during the class period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To support this claim, Gross alleges that, although Summa Four typically requires twelve to twenty weeks to ship its switches following the placement of an order, Fiedler stated at a June 14 board meeting that the company could generate up to $4.7 million in new revenues through the receipt of new orders in the two weeks remaining before the end of the quarter.  Gross contends that, given the time it takes Summa Four to fill orders, the statement is inexplicable unless the company was recognizing revenue upon receipt of orders instead of upon shipment.  Gross finds further corroboration for this claim in Summa Four's May 1994 board meeting minutes where it is recorded that the company's chief financial officer was working on a new \"revenue recognition policy\" that was to be \"more formalized and somewhat more restrictive\" than its previous policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though these contentions give us some pause, we nonetheless agree with the district court that Gross failed to plead this claim with sufficient particularity for purposes of Rule 9(b).  As we have noted, \"a general allegation that the practices at issue resulted in a false report of company earnings is not a sufficiently particular claim of misrepresentation [to satisfy Rule 9(b) ].\"  Serabian, 24 F.3d at 362 n. 5.   In this case, Gross has failed to allege any particulars to support his general allegation of inflated earnings through the use of improper accounting methods.  Specifically, he has not alleged the amount of the putative overstatement or the net effect it had on the company's earnings.  See Shushany v. Allwaste, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606005\"><a href=\"/opinion/606005/felix-shushany-and-shepard-bartnoff-v-allwaste-inc-and-raymond-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 522 (5th Cir.1993) (allegation that company had adjusted the accounting of its inventory to inflate revenues and earnings does not sufficiently plead fraud where complaint does not explain, inter alia, how the adjustments affected the company's financial statements and whether they were material in light of the company's overall financial position);  Roots Partnership, 965 F.2d at 1419 (allegation that company \"failed to establish adequate reserves for its excessive and outdated inventory\" does not satisfy Rule 9(b) where investor does not allege \"what the reserves were or suggest how great the reserves should have been\");  Decker v.

Arguably, the statement supports a reasonable inference that the company, or at least Fiedler, may have contemplated booking revenue upon the receipt of orders rather than shipment for the quarter ending on June 30, 1994;  however, we do not think that the statement, by itself, is sufficient to indicate that the company had actually booked as revenue sales instead of shipments in any previous quarter.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Moreover, we do not think the ambiguous statements taken from the minutes of the May 1994 board meeting concerning review of the company's accounting system corroborate Fiedler's June 14 statement sufficiently to overcome the deficiencies in Gross's pleadings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>III.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.

See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1202 n. 3 (discussing Roeder )</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Summa Four's January Monthly Operating Report, issued February 25, 1994, states, inter alia, that</p>\n        <p>[a] major reorganization of sales responsibilities in [the company's international operations] is planned to take place during March.  It is intended to refocus that organization on European opportunities and to emphasize the development of distribution channels in major marketplaces such as France and Germany.</p>\n        <p>The report further states that a \"corporate reorganization of Austrel's domestic and international marketing responsibilities has slowed completion of the Australian opportunities.\"</p>\n        <p>Summa Four's March Monthly Operating Report, issued in April 1994, indicated that the company had replaced the Managing Director of Summa Four's European operations along with two other members of the international management team.  In addition, an excerpt from the minutes of a June 20, 1994, meeting indicated that Summa Four was experiencing further difficulties in its international operations.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In the amended complaint, Gross never quotes the portion of the challenged statement that expressly indicates that it refers to orders received \"[i]n the fourth quarter.\"   Nevertheless, in reviewing a motion to dismiss, we may consider in its entirety a relevant document explicitly relied on by the plaintiff in the complaint.  See Shaw, 82 F.3d at 1220;  Philip Morris, 75 F.3d at 809</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Gross also points to an excerpt from the January 18 press release, which noted that Summa Four had received orders from Unisys, Sprint, IBM, DEC, Pacific Bell, USWest and AT &amp; T.  We reject Gross's claims with regard to this statement for essentially the same reasons that we reject his claim that the May 3 statement was materially misleading</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> As with the June 29 letter, Gross would have no standing to assert a securities fraud claim that Summa Four misstated its revenue only for the quarter ending June 30, 1994</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Gross also contends that the district court erred in refusing to consider two additional affidavits Gross filed with the court to accompany his motion for reconsideration pursuant to Fed R. Civ. P. 59(e).  The district court refused to consider the additional affidavits, noting that Gross had \"not demonstrated that he could not have produced this information in response to defendant's motion to dismiss.\"   In that the affidavits address whether the amended complaint adequately alleged undisclosed facts to support the inference that a reasonable investor would have considered Summa Four's public statements to be false and misleading--an issue clearly before the court on Summa Four's motion to dismiss--we find no abuse of discretion by the district court in its refusal to consider them.
