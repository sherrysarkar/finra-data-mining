COUTURE,\r\n\n            Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\nAPPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n          FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n                    Before\r\n\n           Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n        Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n          and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                     Christopher W. Dilworth, for appellant Jeffrey Cressey.\r\nRichard S. Emerson, Jr., with whom Childs, Emerson, Rundlett,\r\nFifield &amp; Childs, was on brief for appellant Gregory A. Couture.\r\nMargaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, and Helene\r\nKazanjian, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                 \r\n\n               March 31, 1998\r\n                                           Per Curiam.  According to the government, between 1992\r\nand 1996, Rick Lachance regularly bought large amounts of cocaine\r\nfrom David Gell and Luis Peralta in New York City, and sold several\r\nounces per week to appellants Jeffrey Cressey and Gregory Couture,\r\nas well as Albin Lavallee, Raymond Bergeron, Cory Ison, and others\r\nin Maine.  Cressey, Couture, and the others resold the cocaine in\r\ngram amounts to individual users.  This \"spoke\" conspiracy was the\r\nsubject of a federal investigation.\r\nCressey was eventually indicted, with Bergeron, Ison, and\r\nPeralta, on one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to\r\ndistribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841 (a)(1), 841\r\n(b)(1)(B), and 846.  Couture was indicted separately under the same\r\ncharge.  The two indictments were consolidated for trial over the\r\nobjections of Cressey and Couture.  Ison and Peralta pled guilty\r\nand the other three defendants proceeded to trial.  The jury\r\nreturned a guilty verdict, and Cressey and Couture were sentenced\r\nto 97 and 70 months imprisonment, respectively.\r\nOn appeal, both Cressey and Couture raise a number of\r\nalleged errors committed by the district court.  Finding none after\r\ncareful review, we affirm the convictions.\r\nThe first error that the district court is alleged to\r\nhave made was joining the trials of Cressey, Couture and Bergeron. \r\nThe joinder was ordered over objection, and Cressey's motion to\r\nsever was later denied.  District court decisions to sever criminal\r\ntrials under Fed. R. Crim. P. 14 or join trials under Fed. R. Crim.\r\nP. 13 are subject to review for an abuse of discretion standard. \r\nSee United States v. Jones, 10 F.3d 901, 908 (1st Cir. 1993);\r\nUnited States v. Clayton, 450 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1971).  For an\r\nappellant to prevail, he must show that he suffered substantial\r\nprejudice from a joint trial amounting to a miscarriage of justice. \r\nSee Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 540 (1993); Jones, 10\r\nF.3d at 908-909.  No miscarriage of justice occurred in this case.\r\nThere is a presumption that co-defendants in the same\r\nventure should be tried together, in part to promote judicial\r\nefficiency, and in part to avoid inconsistent verdicts.  SeeZafiro, 506 U.S. at 537.  The cases against Cressey and Couture\r\ninvolved the same drug coming from the same sources within the same\r\ntime period.  They resold the drugs in the same mid-coast region of\r\nMaine.  It is beyond dispute that most of the evidence admissible\r\nat trial was correctly determined to be admissible against both\r\nappellants.  Where evidence was admitted against only one\r\ndefendant, the court limited the jury's consideration of the\r\nevidence.  The government's opening and closing statements\r\nsegregated the evidence against each defendant, and the court\r\ncharged the jury carefully, reminding them that their verdicts need\r\nnot be consistent and to consider each defendant individually.  We\r\nare satisfied that the district court did not abuse its discretion\r\nin joining the cases against Cressey and Couture.\r\nThe district court is also alleged to have erred in\r\ndenying Cressey and Couture's motions for acquittal.  We disagree. \r\nThe evidence against both appellants in this case was overwhelming. \r\nLavallee and Lachance's testimony clearly establishes that, one or\r\nmore times each week, Cressey and Couture each bought up to three\r\nounces of cocaine between 1993 and 1995.  The fact that they did\r\nnot know each other, or that certain additional evidence was\r\ncollected against one of the two appellants was simply irrelevant\r\nto their motions for acquittal.\r\nWe are also persuaded that the district court properly\r\nupheld objections to questions from Cressey's counsel directed\r\ntoward an unrelated marijuana conspiracy.  While these questions\r\nwere not grossly out of line, the district court was acting well\r\nwithin its discretion to limit cross-examination so as to avoid\r\nprejudice, confusion and unnecessary waste of time.  See United\r\nStates v. Malik, 928 F.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing Delawarev. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S 673, 679 (1986)).  Furthermore, it remains\r\na mystery how the court's ruling could have prejudiced Cressey. \r\nEvidence of further involvement with drugs would not have\r\nexculpated Cressey and Couture absent jury confusion.  In the face\r\nof Lachance and Levallee's testimony, we find it utterly\r\ninconceivable that Cressey and Couture were being tried for the\r\nwrong crime.\r\nIt is further alleged on appeal that Cressey's counsel\r\nwas inappropriately interrupted during closing arguments from the\r\nbench.  However, Cressey's counsel admits that the statements to\r\nthe jury that were corrected were inaccurate recitations of facts\r\nin evidence.  Under the circumstances, the district court judge was\r\nwell within his discretion to stop counsel.  United States v.\r\nWilliams, 809 F.2d 75, 79-80 (1st Cir. 1986) (district courts have\r\nbroad discretion to control closing arguments, including the\r\nauthority to correct inaccurate statements).  There is certainly no\r\nabuse of discretion where, as here, the district court invites\r\ncounsel to a sidebar and gives counsel an opportunity to correct\r\nhis misstatements before the jury, instead of having the judge do\r\nso in an apparent reprimand.\r\nWe also conclude that the district court charged the jury\r\nand responded to their subsequent inquiries appropriately.  The\r\ncourt correctly determined that a multiple conspiracy jury\r\ninstruction was not warranted.  There was no evidence that any of\r\nthe defendants participated in any conspiracy other than the one\r\ncharged.  The court's instructions carefully and adequately\r\ndescribed the crime of conspiracy.\r\nAs the jurors were deliberating, they presented the\r\ndistrict court judge with a request to re-read Cressey's cross-\r\nexamination of Lavallee.  Despite the fact that, at the outset of\r\nthe trial, the judge had explained that there would be no\r\ntranscript and that the jurors would have to rely on their\r\nrecollections of testimony and any notes that they may have taken,\r\nthe judge offered to have the court reporter translate aloud her\r\nshorthand notes in the jury's presence.  The judge explained that\r\nsuch a process would be time-consuming, in part because sections of\r\nthe direct and cross-examinations would have to be read.  The jury\r\nultimately rejected the judge's offer and reached its verdict.  We\r\nfind that the judge's response was well within his discretion and\r\ndid not prejudice the defendants in this case.\r\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment of\r\nthe district court is affirmed.\n",
