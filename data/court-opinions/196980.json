Appellant  James E.  Cofield appeals\r                                 \r\n\nfrom  the  judgment  of  the  district  court  affirming  the\r\n\nbankruptcy court's dismissal of  his chapter 11 petition \"for\r\n\ncause.\"   See 11  U.S.C.    1112(b).   We  have reviewed  the\r                         \r\n\nrecord  and the  briefs  on appeal  and  affirm the  district\r\n\ncourt's judgment  for essentially  the reasons stated  in the\r\n\nMemorandum and Order, dated  December 14, 1995.  We  add only\r\n\ntwo comments.\r\n\n          1.  The bankruptcy  court was entitled to consider,\r\n\nand  rule  on,  the  practicability  of  appellant's proposed\r\n\nreorganization plan  in determining  whether  his chapter  11\r\n\npetition  was filed in bad  faith for purposes  of   1112(b).\r\n\nSee In re  MacElvain, 160  B.R. 672 (Bankr.  M.D. Ala.  1993)\r                                \r\n\n(bankruptcy   court  reviewed,  and   found  inadequate,  the\r\n\nproposed reorganization plan in deciding whether to dismiss a\r\n\nchapter 11  petition under    1112(b)),  aff'd, 180 B.R.  670\r                                                          \r\n\n(M.D. Ala. 1995).\r\n\n          2.    As  for  the correctness  of  the  bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt's  factual findings,  appellant's  only  contention  on\r\n\nappeal  is that  there was  no support  for such  findings as\r\n\n\"argued in the briefs in the district court.\"  A reference to\r\n\nlower court pleadings is  insufficient to preserve for appeal\r\n\nthe  question of  the correctness  of the  bankruptcy court's\r\n\nfindings.  See Gilday v. Callahan, 59 F.3d 257, 273 n.23 (1st\r                                             \r\n\nCir. 1995)  (a reference  to arguments  made in the  district\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ncourt is  not sufficient to warrant  appellate review), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied,  116 S.Ct. 1269  (1996).  Thus,  appellant has waived\r                  \r\n\nthe issue on appeal.\r\n\n          Affirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.\r                                    \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
