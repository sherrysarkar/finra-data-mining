During the\r\n\nnext  few  years he  was promoted  and transferred  several times\r\n\nbefore  attaining  the  classification  of   Personnel  Relations\r\n\nCounselor,  equivalent  to  Occupational  Counselor  III, at  the\r\n\nCentral Office in San Juan.\r\n\n          In September  1986 Diaz  enlisted in the  United States\r\n\nArmy and  entered on active  duty for approximately  nine months,\r\n\nreceiving military leave pay  from the RWA as required  by Puerto\r\n\nRico law.

McCabe v. Life-Line Ambulance Serv., Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n77 F.3d 540, 544  (1st Cir.), petition for cert.  filed, 64 U.S.-\r                                                                 \r\nL.W. 3808 (U.S. May 29, 1996) (No. 95-1929).  \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nable  discharge in May 1987,  he became an  active reservist with\r\n\nthe 448th Engineer  Battalion at Fort Buchanan,  which meant that\r\n\nhe remained on paid military leave from the  RWA until July 1987.\r\n\n          When Diaz reported for duty with the RWA at its Central\r\n\nOffice  following  his  return from  active  duty  with  the Army\r\n\nReserves, he  discovered that a person  with inferior educational\r\n\nqualifications  and  experience had  been  assigned  to fill  his\r\n\nposition.  Nevertheless,  as directed, Diaz reported  for work as\r\n\nan Occupational Counselor  III in the  San Juan Regional  Office,\r\n\nlocated in the same building, where for one month he was assigned\r\n\nto a cubicle filled with boxes and office supplies but no desk or\r\n\nchair.   He complained to  the Office of  Reservist and Veteran's\r\n\nAffairs, and,  in  March 1988,  to the  Board of  Appeals of  the\r\n\nCommonwealth Personnel  Administration System,  all to  no avail.\r\n\nApproximately  two months  later, a  complaint to  the Employee's\r\n\nAssociation resulted in his reassignment to the Central Office as\r\n\na Counselor in the Business Development Area.  \r\n\n          In  addition,  Diaz  was  reprimanded  unjustly  by his\r\n\nsupervisors on two occasions upon his return from military leave.\r\n\nFirst,  he  states that  the Director  of  the San  Juan Regional\r\n\nOffice, Aida Iris Castro Mundo, informed him that he wasted a lot\r\n\nof  time on military  exercises.   Following their  meeting, Diaz\r\n\nreceived  a  letter  from Castro  Mundo,  dated  April  15, 1988,\r\n\nadvising that he needed  to improve his job performance  in light\r\n\nof  the fact  that  he had:    delayed assigning  cases  to other\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\ncounselors; refused to receive  cases after 3:30 p.m.; frequently\r\n\nabsented himself  from his workplace during  office hours; failed\r\n\nto  complete  cases on  time; and  either  failed to  perform, or\r\n\nperformed poorly, various other official responsibilities.   Diaz\r\n\ndenies these accusations.  Second, at his  deposition Diaz testi-\r\n\nfied that he had been reprimanded unfairly by another supervisor,\r\n\nJose  Figueroa,  for not  being at  his  work station  during the\r\n\nmiddle of a day following his  return from military training.  He\r\n\nexplained his four-hour  absence on that occasion  as having been\r\n\ndevoted to making  sure the RWA paid  him for the time he  was on\r\n\nmilitary  leave.   Diaz further  states that  he received  no job\r\n\ndescription until July 1994, despite a promise six  years earlier\r\n\nthat  he would receive one, and that his supervisors harassed him\r\n\nby evaluating his work performance absent a job description.  \r\n\n          No  other  negative  job evaluation  appears  in  Diaz'\r\n\npersonnel  record.  Nonetheless, and  though in June  1988 he had\r\n\nbeen  designated a Counselor  of Special Projects  in the Central\r\n\nOffice as  he requested, Diaz testified  that Supervisor Fernando\r\n\nFreses made  him uncomfortable with jokes about  the military and\r\n\nits exercises, and  that he so  informed Freses.   When asked  on\r\n\ndeposition whether it  was a joke, Diaz replied:   \"It was like a\r\n\njoke, but I did not know what  that would lead to.  Because maybe\r\n\nbehind the words, well, there could be other intentions . . . .\" \r\n\n          Diaz  testified  that  his  desk  and  belongings  were\r\n\nrelocated four times  before or  during military  leaves in  1991\r\n\nalone, though there was  no change in work duties.   For example,\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nin  July 1991, without warning and after submitting a request for\r\n\nmilitary leave, his desk  was set apart from co-workers  until he\r\n\ncomplained to  his supervisor.   When he  returned from  military\r\n\nleave  the following month, however, his desk had been removed to\r\n\nthe Training  Division on the same  floor.  Diaz was  told by the\r\n\nsupervisor that this was  a temporary measure, necessitated by  a\r\n\nremodeling project.   But when  he returned from  leave again  in\r\n\nSeptember 1991, after the remodeling had been completed, his desk\r\n\nhad  been relocated  again, this  time to  the Payment  Division.\r\n\nOnce  again he  was told  by  his supervisor  that  the move  was\r\n\ntemporary.  Upon his return from military leave in November 1991,\r\n\nhis desk was located in the Learning Program Division, ostensibly\r\n\nas an emergency measure related to space problems.  \r\n\n          The  remodeling  plans  for  the  Communal  Development\r\n\nDivision included  no work  station for  Diaz,  even though  work\r\n\nstations were provided for  two co-workers who had  arrived after\r\n\nDiaz.2  As a  consequence, Diaz remained in the  Learning Program\r\n\nDivision until the end of May  1992.  Finally, unlike all his co-\r\n\nworkers in  the Learning  Program  Division and  in the  Communal\r\n\nDevelopment Division, Diaz was not  provided a telephone.  Super-\r\n\nvisor Jose Figueroa explained to Diaz in March 1992:  \"Oh, you do\r\n\nnot have  a  telephone  because the  day  the  telephone  company\r\n\noperator came you were in [sic] one of these [sic] damn  military\r\n\nleaves of yours.\"   In  late March 1992,  Diaz complained to  his\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2In October 1989, the Special Projects Area became the\r\nCommunal Development Division.  \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nsupervisor  that all  his  work  duties  had been  reassigned  to\r\n\nothers.  \r\n\n          Around the  same time, he complained  of migraine head-\r\n\naches and the State  Insurance Fund ordered home rest  from April\r\n\n10 to  May 18, 1992.  Upon returning from medical leave, Diaz was\r\n\ngiven  no  work  assignment for  approximately  two  weeks.   The\r\n\nfollowing month  he was  transferred to the  Participant Services\r\n\nDivision in the Central Office, located on the tenth floor of the\r\n\nsame  building.   After  protesting the  transfer and  requesting\r\n\nadministrative review, he reported as directed to the Participant\r\n\nServices Division upon returning  from another military leave and\r\n\nwas informed that there was no work for him to do.  Approximately\r\n\none week later,  having been  given no work  assignment, he  com-\r\n\nplained to  the  State Insurance  Fund that  he was  experiencing\r\n\ninsomnia, headaches and neck  and back pain.  A  private psychia-\r\n\ntrist prescribed two weeks' rest.  Subsequently, another psychia-\r\n\ntrist evaluated Diaz, concluding  that he suffered from dysthymia\r\n\nwith anxiety somatization.3  \r\n\n          On  August 6,  1992, having been  assigned no  work for\r\n\nfive consecutive weeks, during a ten-week period, Diaz received a\r\n\ncopy  of a  letter, dated  July  24, 1992,  from  the manager  of\r\n\nParticipant Services to the director of Occupational Orientation,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Dysthymia:  \"any  despondent mood  or depressive  tendency,\r\noften  associated  with  hypochondriasis.\"     Blakiston's  Gould\r                                                                           \r\nMedical  Dictionary  420 (4th  ed.  1956).

Only then was he given\r\n\nwork  duties.  In  September 1992, he was  instructed to \"read\" a\r\n\n200-page  statute in three days, but found the task too demanding\r\n\nas he had  been prescribed  Prozac, then \"something  else with  a\r\n\nlithium  base,\" and finally Xanac, by his psychiatrist.  At Diaz'\r\n\nrequest, the director of  Occupational Orientation later  reduced\r\n\nthe assignment to twenty-five pages per day.  Diaz testified that\r\n\nother incidents  also made him \"feel  very bad because .  . . all\r\n\nthis mess, of the Army Reserve and the drills, this was all going\r\n\nto continue.   And this was going to be a  nightmare until I left\r\n\nthe Army or  until I left this agency, this  was going to contin-\r\n\nue.\"  \r\n\n          On July  16, 1993, Diaz filed  suit against defendants-\r\n\nappellees Maria Rosa Dapena-Thompson  and her successor, in their\r\n\nrespective official capacities as the RWA director, alleging that\r\n\nhe had been harassed,  denigrated, and persecuted after returning\r\n\nfrom military  leave for  required training  and drills  with his\r\n\nreserve  unit.   He  demanded  damages for  mental  and emotional\r\n\nsuffering,  as well  as reclassification  in accordance  with RWA\r\n\nrules and regulations.  Shortly after filing the  complaint, Diaz\r\n\nwas  promoted to Occupational Counselor  IV, the highest grade he\r\n\nhas ever attained.  \r\n\n          In due course, defendants moved for summary judgment on\r\n\nthe ground, inter  alia, that  there was  no trialworthy  dispute\r                                 \r\n\nconcerning whether  defendants had discriminated  against Diaz in\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nviolation of the VRRA.  Diaz seasonably interposed opposition  to\r\n\nthe motion for summary judgment.   Thereafter, the parties stipu-\r\n\nlated to certain   uncontested facts and consented to  proceed to\r\n\nfinal judgment before  a magistrate judge  in accordance with  28\r\n\nU.S.C. 636(c)(1) and (3) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 73.  Ultimately, the\r\n\nmagistrate judge entered summary judgment for both defendants. \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                           DISCUSSION4\r                                     DISCUSSION\r                                               \r\n\n          The VRRA is  to be liberally construed.

Although  appellees  contend that  their\r\n\nemployment  actions  denied Diaz  no  \"incident  or advantage  of\r\n\nemployment\"  within the meaning  of VRRA    2021(b)(3),  we think\r\n\nthere can  be no question that  discriminatory employment actions\r\n\n\"like demotion,\" including constructive demotion, based solely on\r\n\nreservist participation, constitute the very  sort of discrimina-\r\n\ntory conduct the Congress sought to deter under   2021(b)(3).  \r\n\n          We  have held that a state trooper was denied an \"inci-\r\n\ndent  or advantage  of  employment\" by  reason  of his  reservist\r\n\ntraining  and responsibilities  when he  was transferred  from an\r\n\neight-hour  weekday shift  to  a nine-hour  shift which  included\r\n\nweekend duty.

Thus, reassignment to a substantially less favor-\r\n\nable  work  schedule deprived  Carlson  of a  privilege  of rank,\r\n\nresulting  in a  constructive demotion  because of  his reservist\r\n\nduties, in violation of VRRA    2021(b)(3).\r\n\n          The  summary  judgment record  discloses that  Diaz had\r\n\nbeen subjected  to adverse  changes in  work conditions  as well,\r\n\nupon return from  active duty with the Army  Reserves.  First, he\r\n\nlost  substantial privileges of rank,  in that he  was assigned a\r\n\nwork  station, with no  desk or chair,  in a  cubicle filled with\r\n\nboxes  and office  supplies.   On four  occasions in  1991 alone,\r\n\neither before or during military leaves,  his desk and belongings\r\n\nwere relocated apart  from all  his co-workers.   In early  1992,\r\n\nDiaz, alone among his co-workers,  was provided with no telephone\r\n\nwhatsoever.  Second, Diaz'  job responsibilities had been reduced\r\n\nto the  point that by  early 1992  all his work  duties had  been\r                                                \r\n\nassigned to others.  Thus, for five consecutive weeks during this\r\n\nperiod, Diaz  was given no work  duties at all.   Cf.  Agosto-de-\r                                                                           \r\n\nFeliciano, 889  F.2d  at 1219  (holding  that reduction  in  work\r                   \r\n\nduties  must extend  beyond a  \"week or  two\" before  it  will be\r\n\nconsidered sufficiently  severe to be actionable  in First Amend-\r\n\nment \"political  discrimination\"  context); compare  Township  of\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nFalls,  890  F.2d at  618 (holding  that  a partial  reduction in\r               \r\n\nduties during six-week period constituted  temporary reassignment\r\n\ninsufficient  to  support  procedural  due  process  claim  under\r\n\nFourteenth Amendment).  Third, Diaz was \"left in limbo\" as to his\r\n\nactual rank, since he was without a job description for six years\r\n\nand given  no work responsibilities  for weeks at  a time.   Once\r\n\nwork assignments resumed, moreover,  Diaz was not informed  as to\r\n\ntheir grade level.  \r\n\n          Viewing  the  competent  evidence, and  all  reasonable\r\n\ninferences  therefrom, in  the light most  favorable to  Diaz, we\r\n\nconclude that he  generated a trialworthy issue  of material fact\r\n\nas  to whether the cumulative effect  of these adverse employment\r\n\nactions  was enough \"like demotion\" to be actionable under VRRA  \r\n\n2021(b)(3).  A reasonable trier of fact could  find that Diaz was\r\n\nsubjected to adverse work-condition  changes, extending over more\r\n\nthan five years and amounting to constructive reductions in rank,\r\n\nthat  could deter  continued  participation in  the military  re-\r\n\nserves.  Thus, Diaz made  out a prima facie case that he had been\r\n\ndenied  \"incident[s] or  advantage[s]  of employment\"  within the\r\n\nmeaning of VRRA   2021(b)(3).  \r\n\nB.   \"Motivated Solely By Reserve Status\"\r          B.   \"Motivated Solely By Reserve Status\r                                                  \r\n\n          The  VRRA affords  recourse for  certain discriminatory\r\n\nemployment  actions  against  employee-reservists  taken  \"solely\r\n\nbecause of  their military  obligations.\"   Monroe,  452 U.S.  at\r                                                            \r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n565.7   As  there  is scant  evidence  that the  alleged  adverse\r\n\nemployment actions against Diaz  were other than reservist-status\r\n\nbased, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence,  if credit-\r\n\ned,  to  meet the  second criterion  under  VRRA    2021(b)(3) as\r\n\nwell.8 \r\n\n          Diaz  proffered  considerable  circumstantial  evidence\r                                                                 \r\n\nthat  the  challenged actions  were  motivated  by his  reservist\r\n\nobligations.    For example,  following  his  return from  active\r\n\nreserve duty in  1987, he was  assigned to a cubicle  filled with\r\n\nboxes  and office  supplies, with  no desk  or chair.   Again, in\r\n\n1991,  upon returning  from reserve  duty, he  underwent repeated\r\n\nrelocations to  work stations apart  from all co-workers.   After\r\n\nreturning  from reserve training in 1992, he was assigned no work\r\n\nresponsibilities for five consecutive weeks.

All\r\nagreed,  at a minimum,  that VRRA    2021(b)(3) prohibits certain\r\ndiscriminatory  employment  actions motivated  by  the plaintiff-\r                        \r\nemployee's  reservist status.   Their disagreement concerned only\r\nwhether reservists  are  entitled to  preferential  work-schedule\r                                                            \r\naccommodations by reason of their military training responsibili-\r\nties.  Diaz, on the other hand, alleges discriminatory employment\r                                                                \r\nactions based on his responsibilities as a reservist.\r\n\n     8Upon remand, the district  court must determine whether any\r\nuncontroverted  material facts are to be deemed established.

Furthermore, though Diaz now contends that USERRA   4311\r\napplies  retroactively  to  the present  case,  he  made  no such\r\ncontention  below, nor does he  now contend that  the USERRA pre-\r\nscribes  the burden  allocation  regimen for  these VRRA  claims.\r\nConsequently, we decline to volunteer our views on  these matters\r\nin the present vacuum.

Diaz\r\n\nfurther  states that  Supervisor Figueroa  informed him  that the\r\n\nreason  Diaz had no  telephone was that  he was on  \"one of those\r\n\ndamn military  leaves\" when the telephone  company representative\r\n\ncame.  \r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\n          Viewed in  context, this  evidence cannot  be dismissed\r\n\nsimply as \"stray remarks in  the workplace . . . ,  statements by\r\n\nnondecisionmakers, or  statements by decisionmakers  unrelated to\r\n\nthe decisional process itself,\"  Price Waterhouse v.

The statement  attributed  to  Supervisor Figueroa,  in\r\n\nparticular, could support a fair inference that the discriminato-\r\n\nry work conditions,  viz., the  total denial of  a telephone  and\r                                  \r\n\nwork assignments, as well  as repeated work-station changes, were\r\n\ndirectly linked to Diaz' reservist status and responsibilities.  \r\n\n          Furthermore, for their part  defendants offer no expla-\r                                                                    \r\n\nnation  for not providing Diaz with either  a desk or a chair for\r\n\nan entire month following his return from military leave in 1987.\r\n\nAs  for the disparaging remarks made to Diaz by Supervisor Freses\r\n\nin 1988, relating to the military and to Diaz' military exercises\r\n\nin  particular, the  defendants merely  point out  that Diaz  has\r\n\nacknowledged that these remarks took the outward form of \"jokes.\"\r                                                               \r\n\nThus, defendants tender  no compelling basis  upon which to  con-\r\n\nclude that a factfinder could not reasonably  infer a discrimina-\r\n\ntory reservist-based motivation  from the direct and  circumstan-\r\n\ntial evidence proffered by Diaz.  \r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\n          Similarly, defendants offer no explanation for refusing\r                    \r\n\nto  assign Diaz work responsibilities  for a total  of five weeks\r\n\nduring a ten-week period following his return from military leave\r\n\nin 1992, notwithstanding the fact that the manager of the Partic-\r\n\nipant  Services Division, to which Diaz was assigned at the time,\r\n\nadvised the Director of the Occupational Orientation Division, in\r\n\nwriting, that \"non-use of [Diaz] is  not productive nor advisable\r\n\nfor the  best welfare of the  Occupational Orientation Division.\"\r\n\nTo  this point,  therefore, defendants  have met  Diaz' competent\r\n\ndirect  and  circumstantial evidence  with  neither  evidence nor\r\n\nexplanation which would compel a reasonable trier of fact to find\r\n\nthat the challenged employment  actions were not motivated solely\r\n\nby  Diaz'  reservist obligations.

Nevertheless,  as directed, Diaz reported  for work as\r\n\nan Occupational Counselor  III in the  San Juan Regional  Office,\r\n\nlocated in the same building, where for one month he was assigned\r\n\nto a cubicle filled with boxes and office supplies but no desk or\r\n\nchair.   He complained to  the Office of  Reservist and Veteran's\r\n\nAffairs, and,  in  March 1988,  to the  Board of  Appeals of  the\r\n\nCommonwealth Personnel  Administration System,  all to  no avail.\r\n\nApproximately  two months  later, a  complaint to  the Employee's\r\n\nAssociation resulted in his reassignment to the Central Office as\r\n\na Counselor in the Business Development Area.  \r\n\n          In  addition,  Diaz  was  reprimanded  unjustly  by his\r\n\nsupervisors on two occasions upon his return from military leave.\r\n\nFirst,  he  states that  the Director  of  the San  Juan Regional\r\n\nOffice, Aida Iris Castro Mundo, informed him that he wasted a lot\r\n\nof  time on military  exercises.   Following their  meeting, Diaz\r\n\nreceived  a  letter  from Castro  Mundo,  dated  April  15, 1988,\r\n\nadvising that he needed  to improve his job performance  in light\r\n\nof  the fact  that  he had:    delayed assigning  cases  to other\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\ncounselors; refused to receive  cases after 3:30 p.m.; frequently\r\n\nabsented himself  from his workplace during  office hours; failed\r\n\nto  complete  cases on  time; and  either  failed to  perform, or\r\n\nperformed poorly, various other official responsibilities.   Diaz\r\n\ndenies these accusations.  Second, at his  deposition Diaz testi-\r\n\nfied that he had been reprimanded unfairly by another supervisor,\r\n\nJose  Figueroa,  for not  being at  his  work station  during the\r\n\nmiddle of a day following his  return from military training.  He\r\n\nexplained his four-hour  absence on that occasion  as having been\r\n\ndevoted to making  sure the RWA paid  him for the time he  was on\r\n\nmilitary  leave.   Diaz further  states that  he received  no job\r\n\ndescription until July 1994, despite a promise six  years earlier\r\n\nthat  he would receive one, and that his supervisors harassed him\r\n\nby evaluating his work performance absent a job description.  \r\n\n          No  other  negative  job evaluation  appears  in  Diaz'\r\n\npersonnel  record.  Nonetheless, and  though in June  1988 he had\r\n\nbeen  designated a Counselor  of Special Projects  in the Central\r\n\nOffice as  he requested, Diaz testified  that Supervisor Fernando\r\n\nFreses made  him uncomfortable with jokes about  the military and\r\n\nits exercises, and  that he so  informed Freses.   When asked  on\r\n\ndeposition whether it  was a joke, Diaz replied:   \"It was like a\r\n\njoke, but I did not know what  that would lead to.  Because maybe\r\n\nbehind the words, well, there could be other intentions . . . .\" \r\n\n          Diaz  testified  that  his  desk  and  belongings  were\r\n\nrelocated four times  before or  during military  leaves in  1991\r\n\nalone, though there was  no change in work duties.   For example,\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nin  July 1991, without warning and after submitting a request for\r\n\nmilitary leave, his desk  was set apart from co-workers  until he\r\n\ncomplained to  his supervisor.   When he  returned from  military\r\n\nleave  the following month, however, his desk had been removed to\r\n\nthe Training  Division on the same  floor.  Diaz was  told by the\r\n\nsupervisor that this was  a temporary measure, necessitated by  a\r\n\nremodeling project.   But when  he returned from  leave again  in\r\n\nSeptember 1991, after the remodeling had been completed, his desk\r\n\nhad  been relocated  again, this  time to  the Payment  Division.\r\n\nOnce  again he  was told  by  his supervisor  that  the move  was\r\n\ntemporary.  Upon his return from military leave in November 1991,\r\n\nhis desk was located in the Learning Program Division, ostensibly\r\n\nas an emergency measure related to space problems.  \r\n\n          The  remodeling  plans  for  the  Communal  Development\r\n\nDivision included  no work  station for  Diaz,  even though  work\r\n\nstations were provided for  two co-workers who had  arrived after\r\n\nDiaz.2  As a  consequence, Diaz remained in the  Learning Program\r\n\nDivision until the end of May  1992.  Finally, unlike all his co-\r\n\nworkers in  the Learning  Program  Division and  in the  Communal\r\n\nDevelopment Division, Diaz was not  provided a telephone.  Super-\r\n\nvisor Jose Figueroa explained to Diaz in March 1992:  \"Oh, you do\r\n\nnot have  a  telephone  because the  day  the  telephone  company\r\n\noperator came you were in [sic] one of these [sic] damn  military\r\n\nleaves of yours.\"   In  late March 1992,  Diaz complained to  his\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2In October 1989, the Special Projects Area became the\r\nCommunal Development Division.  \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nsupervisor  that all  his  work  duties  had been  reassigned  to\r\n\nothers.  \r\n\n          Around the  same time, he complained  of migraine head-\r\n\naches and the State  Insurance Fund ordered home rest  from April\r\n\n10 to  May 18, 1992.  Upon returning from medical leave, Diaz was\r\n\ngiven  no  work  assignment for  approximately  two  weeks.   The\r\n\nfollowing month  he was  transferred to the  Participant Services\r\n\nDivision in the Central Office, located on the tenth floor of the\r\n\nsame  building.   After  protesting the  transfer and  requesting\r\n\nadministrative review, he reported as directed to the Participant\r\n\nServices Division upon returning  from another military leave and\r\n\nwas informed that there was no work for him to do.  Approximately\r\n\none week later,  having been  given no work  assignment, he  com-\r\n\nplained to  the  State Insurance  Fund that  he was  experiencing\r\n\ninsomnia, headaches and neck  and back pain.  A  private psychia-\r\n\ntrist prescribed two weeks' rest.  Subsequently, another psychia-\r\n\ntrist evaluated Diaz, concluding  that he suffered from dysthymia\r\n\nwith anxiety somatization.3  \r\n\n          On  August 6,  1992, having been  assigned no  work for\r\n\nfive consecutive weeks, during a ten-week period, Diaz received a\r\n\ncopy  of a  letter, dated  July  24, 1992,  from  the manager  of\r\n\nParticipant Services to the director of Occupational Orientation,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Dysthymia:  \"any  despondent mood  or depressive  tendency,\r\noften  associated  with  hypochondriasis.\"     Blakiston's  Gould\r                                                                           \r\nMedical  Dictionary  420 (4th  ed.  1956).

Only then was he given\r\n\nwork  duties.  In  September 1992, he was  instructed to \"read\" a\r\n\n200-page  statute in three days, but found the task too demanding\r\n\nas he had  been prescribed  Prozac, then \"something  else with  a\r\n\nlithium  base,\" and finally Xanac, by his psychiatrist.  At Diaz'\r\n\nrequest, the director of  Occupational Orientation later  reduced\r\n\nthe assignment to twenty-five pages per day.  Diaz testified that\r\n\nother incidents  also made him \"feel  very bad because .  . . all\r\n\nthis mess, of the Army Reserve and the drills, this was all going\r\n\nto continue.   And this was going to be a  nightmare until I left\r\n\nthe Army or  until I left this agency, this  was going to contin-\r\n\nue.\"  \r\n\n          On July  16, 1993, Diaz filed  suit against defendants-\r\n\nappellees Maria Rosa Dapena-Thompson  and her successor, in their\r\n\nrespective official capacities as the RWA director, alleging that\r\n\nhe had been harassed,  denigrated, and persecuted after returning\r\n\nfrom military  leave for  required training  and drills  with his\r\n\nreserve  unit.   He  demanded  damages for  mental  and emotional\r\n\nsuffering,  as well  as reclassification  in accordance  with RWA\r\n\nrules and regulations.  Shortly after filing the  complaint, Diaz\r\n\nwas  promoted to Occupational Counselor  IV, the highest grade he\r\n\nhas ever attained.  \r\n\n          In due course, defendants moved for summary judgment on\r\n\nthe ground, inter  alia, that  there was  no trialworthy  dispute\r                                 \r\n\nconcerning whether  defendants had discriminated  against Diaz in\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nviolation of the VRRA.  Diaz seasonably interposed opposition  to\r\n\nthe motion for summary judgment.   Thereafter, the parties stipu-\r\n\nlated to certain   uncontested facts and consented to  proceed to\r\n\nfinal judgment before  a magistrate judge  in accordance with  28\r\n\nU.S.C. 636(c)(1) and (3) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 73.  Ultimately, the\r\n\nmagistrate judge entered summary judgment for both defendants. \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                           DISCUSSION4\r                                     DISCUSSION\r                                               \r\n\n          The VRRA is  to be liberally construed.

See Carlson, 609\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  at 1027.  Thus, reassignment to a substantially less favor-\r\n\nable  work  schedule deprived  Carlson  of a  privilege  of rank,\r\n\nresulting  in a  constructive demotion  because of  his reservist\r\n\nduties, in violation of VRRA    2021(b)(3).\r\n\n          The  summary  judgment record  discloses that  Diaz had\r\n\nbeen subjected  to adverse  changes in  work conditions  as well,\r\n\nupon return from  active duty with the Army  Reserves.  First, he\r\n\nlost  substantial privileges of rank,  in that he  was assigned a\r\n\nwork  station, with no  desk or chair,  in a  cubicle filled with\r\n\nboxes  and office  supplies.   On four  occasions in  1991 alone,\r\n\neither before or during military leaves,  his desk and belongings\r\n\nwere relocated apart  from all  his co-workers.   In early  1992,\r\n\nDiaz, alone among his co-workers,  was provided with no telephone\r\n\nwhatsoever.  Second, Diaz'  job responsibilities had been reduced\r\n\nto the  point that by  early 1992  all his work  duties had  been\r                                                \r\n\nassigned to others.  Thus, for five consecutive weeks during this\r\n\nperiod, Diaz  was given no work  duties at all.   Cf.  Agosto-de-\r                                                                           \r\n\nFeliciano, 889  F.2d  at 1219  (holding  that reduction  in  work\r                   \r\n\nduties  must extend  beyond a  \"week or  two\" before  it  will be\r\n\nconsidered sufficiently  severe to be actionable  in First Amend-\r\n\nment \"political  discrimination\"  context); compare  Township  of\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nFalls,  890  F.2d at  618 (holding  that  a partial  reduction in\r               \r\n\nduties during six-week period constituted  temporary reassignment\r\n\ninsufficient  to  support  procedural  due  process  claim  under\r\n\nFourteenth Amendment).  Third, Diaz was \"left in limbo\" as to his\r\n\nactual rank, since he was without a job description for six years\r\n\nand given  no work responsibilities  for weeks at  a time.   Once\r\n\nwork assignments resumed, moreover,  Diaz was not informed  as to\r\n\ntheir grade level.  \r\n\n          Viewing  the  competent  evidence, and  all  reasonable\r\n\ninferences  therefrom, in  the light most  favorable to  Diaz, we\r\n\nconclude that he  generated a trialworthy issue  of material fact\r\n\nas  to whether the cumulative effect  of these adverse employment\r\n\nactions  was enough \"like demotion\" to be actionable under VRRA  \r\n\n2021(b)(3).  A reasonable trier of fact could  find that Diaz was\r\n\nsubjected to adverse work-condition  changes, extending over more\r\n\nthan five years and amounting to constructive reductions in rank,\r\n\nthat  could deter  continued  participation in  the military  re-\r\n\nserves.  Thus, Diaz made  out a prima facie case that he had been\r\n\ndenied  \"incident[s] or  advantage[s]  of employment\"  within the\r\n\nmeaning of VRRA   2021(b)(3).  \r\n\nB.   \"Motivated Solely By Reserve Status\"\r          B.   \"Motivated Solely By Reserve Status\r                                                  \r\n\n          The  VRRA affords  recourse for  certain discriminatory\r\n\nemployment  actions  against  employee-reservists  taken  \"solely\r\n\nbecause of  their military  obligations.\"   Monroe,  452 U.S.  at\r                                                            \r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n565.7   As  there  is scant  evidence  that the  alleged  adverse\r\n\nemployment actions against Diaz  were other than reservist-status\r\n\nbased, we conclude that there is sufficient evidence,  if credit-\r\n\ned,  to  meet the  second criterion  under  VRRA    2021(b)(3) as\r\n\nwell.8 \r\n\n          Diaz  proffered  considerable  circumstantial  evidence\r                                                                 \r\n\nthat  the  challenged actions  were  motivated  by his  reservist\r\n\nobligations.    For example,  following  his  return from  active\r\n\nreserve duty in  1987, he was  assigned to a cubicle  filled with\r\n\nboxes  and office  supplies, with  no desk  or chair.   Again, in\r\n\n1991,  upon returning  from reserve  duty, he  underwent repeated\r\n\nrelocations to  work stations apart  from all co-workers.   After\r\n\nreturning  from reserve training in 1992, he was assigned no work\r\n\nresponsibilities for five consecutive weeks.

All\r\nagreed,  at a minimum,  that VRRA    2021(b)(3) prohibits certain\r\ndiscriminatory  employment  actions motivated  by  the plaintiff-\r                        \r\nemployee's  reservist status.   Their disagreement concerned only\r\nwhether reservists  are  entitled to  preferential  work-schedule\r                                                            \r\naccommodations by reason of their military training responsibili-\r\nties.  Diaz, on the other hand, alleges discriminatory employment\r                                                                \r\nactions based on his responsibilities as a reservist.\r\n\n     8Upon remand, the district  court must determine whether any\r\nuncontroverted  material facts are to be deemed established.  See\r                                                                           \r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(d).  We note that the  exact burden allocation\r\nregimen appropriate  for application to  a VRRA claim  at summary\r\njudgment  has not been addressed  by the parties  or the district\r\ncourt.   Furthermore, though Diaz now contends that USERRA   4311\r\napplies  retroactively  to  the present  case,  he  made  no such\r\ncontention  below, nor does he  now contend that  the USERRA pre-\r\nscribes  the burden  allocation  regimen for  these VRRA  claims.\r\nConsequently, we decline to volunteer our views on  these matters\r\nin the present vacuum.  See Credit Francais Int'l., S.A., 78 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\nat 709. \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\npp. 12-13. \r\n\n          Diaz  also proffered  direct evidence  of a  reservist-\r                                                \r\n\nbased discriminatory animus on the part of the RWA, including his\r\n\ndeposition  testimony that  Regional  Director  Castro-Mundo,  in\r\n\ndemanding improved performance, criticized Diaz for wasting a lot\r\n\nof time  on official matters, including military exercises.
