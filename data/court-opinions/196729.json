In  their statement  of\r\n\nfinancial  affairs, they  listed as  an asset  a Metropolitan\r\n\nLife Insurance Company policy  on the life of Mr.  Caron, and\r\n\nthey  claimed  the  policy's  $19,260 cash  value  as  exempt\r\n\nproperty pursuant  to   522(b)(2)(A) of the  Bankruptcy Code.\r\n\nBecause New Hampshire enacted legislation \"opting out\" of the\r\n\nfederal exemptions, New Hampshire debtors are  only permitted\r\n\nto exempt property pursuant to state-enacted exemptions,  not\r\n\nthose specified in  11 U.S.C.   522(d).   See N.H. Rev. Stat.\r                                                         \r\n\nAnn.       511:2-a (opting out of  federal exemption scheme).\r\n\nFarmington National  Bank, a  creditor of the  Carons, timely\r\n\nfiled  an objection  to  the exemption  claim,  in which  the\r\n\nchapter 13 trustee joined.\r\n\n          After a  hearing  before the  bankruptcy court,  at\r\n\nwhich  a  copy of  the life  insurance  policy was  placed in\r\n\nevidence, the court ruled that the policy was property of the\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nestate  under  11  U.S.C.     541(a)(1)  and  that  the  cash\r\n\nsurrender value of  the life insurance policy was  not exempt\r\n\nunder  New Hampshire law.  The Carons appealed that ruling to\r\n\nthe United  States District  Court  for the  District of  New\r\n\nHampshire, which affirmed the  order of the bankruptcy court.\r\n\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\n          The  sole issue  for determination  is whether  the\r\n\ncourts below erred in holding that the  life insurance policy\r\n\nwas not exempt property.  The parties agree with the relevant\r\n\nfactual findings made  by the bankruptcy  court: that at  the\r\n\ntime  of the  filing of  the  bankruptcy petition,  Mr. Caron\r\n\nowned the  life insurance  policy and  retained the  right to\r\n\nchange  the  beneficiary  (his wife  and  co-debtor  Lorraine\r\n\nCaron) and the contingent  beneficiaries (their children), as\r\n\nwell as the right to surrender the policy for its cash value.\r\n\nThus, for purposes of this appeal,  all that is before us  is\r\n\nthe  legal conclusion that the policy was not exempt, and our\r\n\nstandard of review is de novo.   See T I Federal Credit Union\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921, 928 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                       \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          In order to determine whether the cash value of the\r\n\npolicy is exempt,  we begin with  the New Hampshire  statute,\r\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   408:2, which provides: \r\n\n               If  a policy  of  life or  endowment\r\n          insurance  is effected  by any  person on\r\n          his own life or on another life, in favor\r\n          of a person other than  himself having an\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          insurable  interest  therein, the  lawful\r\n          beneficiary thereof other than himself or\r\n          his   legal  representatives,   shall  be\r\n          entitled  to its  proceeds and  all other\r\n          benefits     against    creditors     and\r\n          representatives  of the  person effecting\r\n          the  same; provided, that, subject to the\r\n          statute of limitations, the amount of any\r\n          premiums for said insurance paid in fraud\r\n          of  creditors,   with  interest  thereon,\r\n          shall  enure to  their  benefit from  the\r\n          proceeds of the policy. \r\n\n          The bankruptcy court ruled  that the policy was not\r\n\nexempt,  incorporating  by  reference its  discussion  of the\r\n\nissue in In re  Monahan, 171 B.R. 710, 715-21  (Bankr. D.N.H.\r                                   \r\n\n1994)  where  it  decided   three  separate  cases  involving\r\n\nexemption  claims  under   New  Hampshire's  life   insurance\r\n\nexemption statute,   408:2.  \r\n\n          Because  the New  Hampshire  Supreme Court  has not\r\n\nrendered any  decisions construing   408:2,  we interpret the\r\n\nstatute  as  we think  that court  would  interpret it.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court agreed  with  the bankruptcy  court that  the\r\n\nplain meaning of the statute restricts the exemption right to\r\n\nthe   beneficiary   and  provides   no  protection   for  the\r\n\ninsured/owner of the policy.  Because the policy in this case\r\n\nprovided the  beneficiary with  no right  to the proceeds  or\r\n\nother benefits of  the policy  except upon the  death of  the\r\n\ninsured, the  district court ruled that Mrs. Caron, the named\r\n\nbeneficiary, had no right  during the life of her  husband to\r\n\nmaintain the  policy  for her  benefit  or to  surrender  the\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\npolicy for its cash value, and that her sole  interest was as\r\n\nthe beneficiary in the event of Mr. Caron's demise.\r\n\n          The  appellees, Farmington  National  Bank and  the\r\n\nChapter  13 Trustee,  argue  that the  New Hampshire  statute\r\n\ndistinguishes between  the owner/insured of the  policy and a\r\n\nthird  person  beneficiary  and clearly  specifies  that  the\r\n\nperson entitled  to the exemption is  \"the lawful beneficiary\r\n\nthereof,\" not  the insured/owner.   The appellees  argue that\r\n\nonly  when the insured has \"parted with all of his beneficial\r\n\ninterest  therein\" would  a life  insurance policy  be exempt\r\n\nfrom the  insured's creditors, quoting from  and relying upon\r\n\nIn re Bray,  8 F. Supp. 761, 763 (D.N.H.  1934).  They reason\r                      \r\n\nthat since Mr. Caron,  at the time of the  bankruptcy filing,\r\n\nhad  not \"parted  with all  his beneficial  interest\" in  the\r\n\npolicy,  but  rather retained  ownership and  the concomitant\r\n\nrights to reach its cash value and to change the beneficiary,\r\n\nhe still  effectively retained all  the beneficial  interest.\r\n\nMrs. Caron's  interest, they  assert, was both  defeasible by\r\n\nMr. Caron and contingent upon his death.\r\n\n          While the  statute is  not a model  of clarity,  we\r\n\nfind the reasoning  of the bankruptcy court  and the district\r\n\ncourt to be compelling.  We  agree that the statute cannot be\r\n\nread to exempt the  policy in favor of an  owner/insured, but\r\n\nonly in favor of a beneficiary.   And here, the rights of the\r\n\nbeneficiary,  Mrs.  Caron, do  not  arise  until Mr.  Caron's\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\ndeath,  and  her  prospective  rights can  be  diminished  or\r\n\nterminated  by him during his lifetime.  As such, because Mr.\r\n\nCaron  was alive at the  time the petition  in bankruptcy was\r\n\nfiled,  Mrs. Caron had no rights in the proceeds, cash value,\r\n\nor other benefits of the policy.   Thus, she had no  interest\r\n\nin the policy  that could be  exempted by  the statute.   The\r\n\nrights  and   powers  under   the  policy  retained   by  the\r\n\nowner/insured, Mr.  Caron, became the property  of the estate\r\n\nas of the filing of the petition.   See 11 U.S.C.   541(a)(1)\r                                                   \r\n\n(all legal or equitable  interests of the debtor  in property\r\n\nbecome property of the estate upon commencement of the case).\r\n\nAccordingly, neither Mr.  Caron nor his wife  are entitled to\r\n\nthe statutory exemption.1 \r\n\n          While  we recognize  that generally  courts are  to\r\n\nconstrue  exemption  statutes   liberally  to  reflect  their\r\n\nremedial  purposes, we  find reasons  here to  afford  a more\r\n\nnarrow  reading.  While the result that the Carons seek would\r\n\napparently obtain under  the analogous federal  exemption, 11\r\n\nU.S.C.   522(d)(7), see In re Monahan, 171 B.R. at 716 &amp; n.8,\r                                                 \r\n\nlegislative history indicates that New Hampshire opted out of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  We note, but  do not rely upon, the  fact that Mrs. Caron\r\nis  a  co-debtor in  this  joint bankruptcy,  and  it appears\r\ntherefore that  her interest in  the insurance policy  was an\r\nasset of  the estate in any  event, subject to the  claims of\r\nher creditors if  not Mr.  Caron's.  At  most, the  exemption\r               \r\nstatute shelters a policy from the creditors of  the insured;\r\nit  makes no reference  to the creditors  of the beneficiary.\r\nSee N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.   408:2.  \r               \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nthe federal  exemption scheme  because it was  too \"liberal,\"\r\n\noverly  indulgent of  debtors at  the expense  of creditors.2\r\n\nEven more  persuasive is legislative  history indicating that\r\n\nthe  New Hampshire  legislature specifically chose  to delete\r\n\nlanguage that would have made the Carons' arguments much more\r\n\nplausible.   The  statute at  issue, as  originally proposed,\r\n\nprovided that the exemption was available \"whether or not the\r\n\nright to change the beneficiary  is reserved or permitted  to\r\n\nsuch  person  [the  owner/insured],\"  but  that language  was\r\n\nstruck.    New  Hampshire House  Report  on  House Bill  224,\r\n\nJournal of  the House, April 29, 1931, at 698.  We infer from\r\n\nthe  deletion that  the  legislature declined  to extend  the\r\n\nexemption to  policies where  the owner/insured  retained the\r\n\npower  to alter  the  beneficiary.   Of  like import  is  the\r\n\nlegislature's deletion of the provision that \"No court and no\r\n\ntrustee or assignee for the benefit of creditors, shall elect\r\n\nfor  the person  effecting  such insurance  to exercise  such\r\n\nright to change  the named beneficiary.\"  Id.   We infer from\r                                                         \r\n\nthis deletion  a legislative  intent that the  statute should\r\n\nnot  prevent  a bankruptcy  trustee  from  stepping into  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  See New  Hampshire House Judiciary Comm.  Report, Journal\r                   \r\nof  the House, 1981 January  Session, April 23,  1981, at 533\r\n(stating  that  the proposed  opt-out  statute  \"prevents New\r\nHampshire residents from filing with the more liberal federal\r\nbankruptcy  law.\");  Minutes  of  House  Judiciary  Committee\r\nexecutive session April 20, 1981, statement of Representative\r\nEaton  (federal bankruptcy  act  is \"very  liberal\" and  that\r\nstate exemptions ought to control instead).\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\npolicy  owner's  shoes to  exercise  policy  rights, such  as\r\n\nreaching the cash  value or changing the beneficiary.   Thus,\r\n\nthe legislative history strongly  suggests a narrow scope for\r\n\nNew Hampshire's  life insurance  exemption,  and the  Carons'\r\n\nexemption claim falls outside that scope.\r\n\n          Contrary to the Carons' arguments, we are not bound\r\n\nto  follow,  and  need   not  overrule,  the  district  court\r\n\ndecisions in In re  Whelpley, 169 F. 1019 (D.N.H.  1909), and\r                                        \r\n\nIn re  Bray,  8 F.  Supp. 761  (D.N.H. 1934).   The  Whelpley\r                                                                         \r\n\ndecision predates  the enactment  of the present  statute and\r\n\nthe aforementioned legislative choices  to set a narrow scope\r\n\nfor  the  exemption.   Moreover,  the  two-paragraph Whelpley\r                                                                         \r\n\nopinion is devoid of  analysis.  In Bray, the  district court\r                                                    \r\n\nheld  that the life insurance policy was not exempt under the\r                                                        \r\n\nstatute at issue here.  Bray, 8  F. Supp. at 763.  While Bray\r                                                                         \r\n\nprovides more  analytical discussion,  it is not  clear which\r\n\naspects of the insurance policy  rendered it non-exempt.   It\r\n\nis just as plausible,  in our view,  to read Bray as  support\r                                                             \r\n\nfor the appellees' arguments as it is for the Carons'.  Thus,\r\n\nhaving  considered  both  Whelpley  and Bray,  we  find  them\r                                                        \r\n\nunpersuasive.\r\n\n          Because the language of the  exemption statute does\r\n\nnot encompass the insurance policy in this case, the decision\r\n\nof the district court is affirmed.\r                                             \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n",

Caron and Lorraine N. Caron appeal the district court's affirmance of the bankruptcy court's denial of an exemption for the cash surrender value of an insurance policy on Mr. Caron's life.   Because we find that the courts below correctly interpreted the applicable New Hampshire statute, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants, husband and wife, filed a joint Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Hampshire.   In their statement of financial affairs, they listed as an asset a Metropolitan Life Insurance Company policy on the life of Mr. Caron, and they claimed the policy's $19,260 cash value as exempt property pursuant to &#167; 522(b)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code.   Because New Hampshire enacted legislation \"opting out\" of the federal exemptions, New Hampshire debtors are only permitted to exempt property pursuant to state-enacted exemptions, not those specified in 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(d).   See N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 511:2-a (opting out of federal exemption scheme).   Farmington National Bank, a creditor of the Carons, timely filed an objection to the exemption claim, in which the chapter 13 trustee joined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing before the bankruptcy court, at which a copy of the life insurance policy was placed in evidence, the court ruled that the policy was property of the estate under 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1) and that the cash surrender value of the life insurance policy was not exempt under New Hampshire law.   The Carons appealed that ruling to the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire, which affirmed the order of the bankruptcy court.   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sole issue for determination is whether the courts below erred in holding that the life insurance policy was not exempt property.   The parties agree with the relevant factual findings made by the bankruptcy court:  that at the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petition, Mr. Caron owned the life insurance policy and retained the right to change the beneficiary (his wife and co-debtor Lorraine Caron) and the contingent beneficiaries (their children), as well as the right to surrender the policy for its cash value.   Thus, for purposes of this appeal, all that is before us is the legal conclusion that the policy was not exempt, and our standard of review is de novo.   See TI Federal Credit Union v. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921, 928 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to determine whether the cash value of the policy is exempt, we begin with the New Hampshire statute, N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 408:2, which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a policy of life or endowment insurance is effected by any person on his own life or on another life, in favor of a person other than himself having an insurable interest therein, the lawful beneficiary thereof other than himself or his legal representatives, shall be entitled to its proceeds and all other benefits against creditors and representatives of the person effecting the same;  provided, that, subject to the statute of limitations, the amount of any premiums for said insurance paid in fraud of creditors, with interest thereon, shall enure to their benefit from the proceeds of the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court ruled that the policy was not exempt, incorporating by reference its discussion of the issue in In re Monahan, 171 B.R. 710, 715-21 (Bankr.D.N.H.1994) where it decided three separate cases involving exemption claims under New Hampshire's life insurance exemption statute, &#167; 408:2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the New Hampshire Supreme Court has not rendered any decisions construing &#167; 408:2, we interpret the statute as we think that court would interpret it.   The district court agreed with the bankruptcy court that the plain meaning of the statute restricts the exemption right to the beneficiary and provides no protection for the insured/owner of the policy.   Because the policy in this case provided the beneficiary with no right to the proceeds or other benefits of the policy except upon the death of the insured, the district court ruled that Mrs. Caron, the named beneficiary, had no right during the life of her husband to maintain the policy for her benefit or to surrender the policy for its cash value, and that her sole interest was as the beneficiary in the event of Mr. Caron's demise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellees, Farmington National Bank and the Chapter 13 Trustee, argue that the New Hampshire statute distinguishes between the owner/insured of the policy and a third person beneficiary and clearly specifies that the person entitled to the exemption is \"the lawful beneficiary thereof,\" not the insured/owner.   The appellees argue that only when the insured has \"parted with all of his beneficial interest therein\" would a life insurance policy be exempt from the insured's creditors, quoting from and relying upon In re Bray, 8 F.Supp. 761, 763 (D.N.H.1934).   They reason that since Mr. Caron, at the time of the bankruptcy filing, had not \"parted with all his beneficial interest\" in the policy, but rather retained ownership and the concomitant rights to reach its cash value and to change the beneficiary, he still effectively retained all the beneficial interest.   Mrs. Caron's interest, they assert, was both defeasible by Mr. Caron and contingent upon his death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the statute is not a model of clarity, we find the reasoning of the bankruptcy court and the district court to be compelling.   We agree that the statute cannot be read to exempt the policy in favor of an owner/insured, but only in favor of a beneficiary.   And here, the rights of the beneficiary, Mrs. Caron, do not arise until Mr. Caron's death, and her prospective rights can be diminished or terminated by him during his lifetime.   As such, because Mr. Caron was alive at the time the petition in bankruptcy was filed, Mrs. Caron had no rights in the proceeds, cash value, or other benefits of the policy.   Thus, she had no interest in the policy that could be exempted by the statute.   The rights and powers under the policy retained by the owner/insured, Mr. Caron, became the property of the estate as of the filing of the petition.   See 11 U.S.C. &#167; 541(a)(1) (all legal or equitable interests of the debtor in property become property of the estate upon commencement of the case).   Accordingly, neither Mr. Caron nor his wife are entitled to the statutory exemption.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we recognize that generally courts are to construe exemption statutes liberally to reflect their remedial purposes, we find reasons here to afford a more narrow reading.   While the result that the Carons seek would apparently obtain under the analogous federal exemption, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 522(d)(7), see In re Monahan, 171 B.R. at 716 &amp; n. 8, legislative history indicates that New Hampshire opted out of the federal exemption scheme because it was too \"liberal,\" overly indulgent of debtors at the expense of creditors.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Even more persuasive is legislative history indicating that the New Hampshire legislature specifically chose to delete language that would have made the Carons' arguments much more plausible.   The statute at issue, as originally proposed, provided that the exemption was available \"whether or not the right to change the beneficiary is reserved or permitted to such person [the owner/insured],\" but that language was struck.   New Hampshire House Report on House Bill 224, Journal of the House, April 29, 1931, at 698.   We infer from the deletion that the legislature declined to extend the exemption to policies where the owner/insured retained the power to alter the beneficiary.   Of like import is the legislature's deletion of the provision that \"No court and no trustee or assignee for the benefit of creditors, shall elect for the person effecting such insurance to exercise such right to change the named beneficiary.\"  Id.  We infer from this deletion a legislative intent that the statute should not prevent a bankruptcy trustee from stepping into the policy owner's shoes to exercise policy rights, such as reaching the cash value or changing the beneficiary.   Thus, the legislative history strongly suggests a narrow scope for New Hampshire's life insurance exemption, and the Carons' exemption claim falls outside that scope.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the Carons' arguments, we are not bound to follow, and need not overrule, the district court decisions in In re Whelpley, 169 F. 1019 (D.N.H.1909), and In re Bray, 8 F.Supp. 761 (D.N.H.1934).   The Whelpley decision predates the enactment of the present statute and the aforementioned legislative choices to set a narrow scope for the exemption.   Moreover, the two-paragraph Whelpley opinion is devoid of analysis.   In Bray, the district court held that the life insurance policy was not exempt under the statute at issue here.  Bray, 8 F.Supp. at 763.   While Bray provides more analytical discussion, it is not clear which aspects of the insurance policy rendered it non-exempt.   It is just as plausible, in our view, to read Bray as support for the appellees' arguments as it is for the Carons'.   Thus, having considered both Whelpley and Bray, we find them unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the language of the exemption statute does not encompass the insurance policy in this case, the decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We note, but do not rely upon, the fact that Mrs. Caron is a co-debtor in this joint bankruptcy, and it appears therefore that her interest in the insurance policy was an asset of the estate in any event, subject to the claims of her creditors if not Mr. Caron's.   At most, the exemption statute shelters a policy from the creditors of the insured;  it makes no reference to the creditors of the beneficiary.
