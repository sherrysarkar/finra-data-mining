Upon careful review of the briefs and record, it\r\nis apparent that the 405-month term of imprisonment imposed on\r\nCount One, violation of 18 U.S.C.  2119(1), exceeded the 180-month\r\nstatutory maximum applicable to such violations.  Accordingly, that\r\naspect of defendant's sentence must be corrected.\r\nWe reject defendant's contention as to his criminal history\r\ncategory.  Defendant's CHC was not inconsistent with the\r\ninformation in the PSR or with the district court's reference to\r\n\"three felony adjudications whereby the defendant was placed in a\r\njuvenile facility for two years.\"  As defendant did not challenge\r\nthese matters below or ask there for more detailed information, and\r\nas no miscarriage of justice is evident from the arguments and\r\npapers presented to us, we will not remand on this point.  SeeUnited States v. Fuentes-Vazquez, 52 F.3d 394, 396 (1st Cir. 1995). \r\nThe sentence imposed on Count One under 18 U.S.C.  2119(1) is\r\nvacated and remanded to the district court for imposition of the\r\nstatutory maximum sentence of 180 months.  In all other respects\r\nand as to all other counts, the sentence is affirmed.\r\n\n                          -2-\n",
