Defendant Glenn Elion (\"Elion\") appeals a\n\nsentence imposed upon his guilty plea to a one-count information\n\ncharging him with wire fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343\n\nand 2.     He claims that the district court erred in enhancing his\n\nsentence beyond the base level prescribed by the United States\n\nSentencing        Guidelines    (U.S.S.G.)      based    on    facts   not    proven\n\nbeyond     a    reasonable     doubt   in    violation    of    Apprendi     v.   New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).            Elion also mounts a more specific\n\nchallenge to a two-level obstruction of justice increase under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 3C1.1.              The government has moved for a summary\n\naffirmance pursuant to Loc. R. 27(c).               After a thorough review\n\nof the record and of the parties' submissions, we allow the\n\ngovernment's motion and summarily affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n\n      I.        Apprendi\n\n                Elion asserts that the district court violated Apprendi\n\nv.   New       Jersey,   530   U.S.    466    (2000),    by    applying      various\n\nsentencing enhancements to adjust base level of his offense\n\nupward from 6 to 22 without submitting the factual questions\n\nforming the bases for the increases to a jury.                         Since Elion\n\nfailed to raise this            argument before the district court, we\n\nreview for plain error.           United States v. Patrick, 248 F.3d 11\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f(1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 119\n\n(2001).\n\n                We have consistently held that Apprendi does not\n\napply to guideline findings that increase the sentence but do\n\nnot elevate it beyond the statutory maximum.     United States v.\n\nRobinson, 241 F.3d 115, 121 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v.\n\nCaba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001); see also United States\n\nv. LaFreniere, 236 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir. 2001). Thus, since\n\nElion's sentence of 46 months is within 18 U.S.C. § 1343's\n\ndefault statutory maximum of five years, the district court\n\ncommitted no error, plain or otherwise.\n\n    II. Obstruction of Justice\n\n    Elion also challenges the two-level enhancement applied to\n\nhis sentence for obstruction of justice pursuant to    U.S.S.G. §\n\n3C1.1.    Although Elion objected to the enhancement below, he did\n\nso on different grounds than he now raises.       Accordingly, we\n\nreview for plain error.\n\n    Section 3C1.1 prescribes a mandatory two-level increase in\n\na defendant's base offense level if:\n\n\n           (A) the defendant willfully obstructed or\n           impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede,\n           the administration of justice during the\n           course of the investigation, prosecution, or\n           sentencing   of  the   instant  offense   of\n           conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct\n           related to (i) the defendant's offense of\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f             conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii)\n             a closely related offense[.]\n\n       The district court applied the enhancement based on various\n\nmaterial     misrepresentations            Elion    made     to    federal      law\n\nenforcement authorities during the course of their investigation\n\nof a Nigerian advance fee scheme in which Elion was initially\n\ninvolved as a victim.           Elion developed his own fraud scheme\n\n(i.e., the offense of conviction) as a means to obtain funds to\n\nsend    to   the    Nigerian    accounts      under      investigation.         The\n\nmisrepresentations       upon    which      the     obstruction      of   justice\n\nenhancement was based were made in order to avoid detection of\n\nthe extent of his involvement in the Nigerian scheme and of his\n\nown sub-scheme.         Elion now contends that the district court\n\ncommitted plain error in basing the § 3C1.1 enhancement on such\n\nconduct because it did not occur \"during the course of the\n\ninvestigation, prosecution or sentencing\" of the offense of\n\nwhich he was ultimately convicted, but, rather, during the\n\ncourse of the investigation of a separate case.                   We cannot find\n\nplain error.       Had Elion raised the matter below, then presumably\n\nthe record might have been developed to show whether, at the\n\ntime    Elion      committed    one   or     more   of     acts   found    to    be\n\nobstructive, the investigation into the Nigerian scheme had\n\nexpanded to include Elion and conduct relevant to the offense of\n\nconviction.        Since these factual questions could have been\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fresolved      by   the   district    court    had     Elion   presented    this\n\nargument, we cannot find plain error.                 See United States v.\n\nOlivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Where the error\n\ndefendant asserts on appeal depends upon a factual finding the\n\ndefendant neglected to ask the district court to make, the error\n\ncannot   be    'clear'    or   'obvious'     unless    the    desired   factual\n\nfinding is the only one rationally supported by the record\n\nbelow\"); United States v. Lopez, 923 F.2d 47, 50 (5th Cir. 1991)\n\n(\"Questions of fact capable of resolution by the district court\n\nupon proper objection at sentencing can never constitute plain\n\nerror\").\n\n    The government's motion for summary disposition is granted.\n\nThe judgment is affirmed.           See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f",
