Townsend,  General  Counsel,  Suffolk  County  Sheriff's\r                              \r\nDepartment, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                        MARCH 4, 1997\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   Appellant Chukwu  E. Azubuko  appeals\r                                \r\n\nfrom  the  sua  sponte  dismissal,  under  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.\r\n\n12(b)(6), of  his complaint  against Sheriff Robert  C. Rufo.\r\n\nThe court dismissed the complaint, stating that it failed  to\r\n\nstate a claim against the Sheriff.\r\n\n          It  is evident that appellant \"can  prove no set of\r\n\nfacts  in support  of his  claim which  would entitle  him to\r\n\nrelief.\"  See  Conley v.  Gibson, 355 U.S.  41, 45-46  (1957)\r                                            \r\n\n(standard for a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal).  First, it is plain\r\n\nthat appellant is premising  Sheriff Rufo's liability for the\r\n\nalleged false imprisonment solely  on the Sheriff's status as\r\n\na  supervisor or employer.  That is, the only person directly\r                                                                         \r\n\ninvolved  in the incident at the Roxbury District Court is an\r\n\nattorney who  supposedly worked  for Sheriff  Rufo.   A claim\r\n\nwhich  is  premised  solely  on  respondeat  superior  is  an\r\n\nimproper basis for  a   1983 action.  See Figueroa v. Aponte-\r                                                                         \r\n\nRogue, 864 F.2d 947, 953 (1st Cir.  1989) (a defendant may be\r                 \r\n\nfound liable only for his or her own acts or omissions).\r\n\n          Second, appellant  cannot state  a claim for  false\r\n\nimprisonment   under   the   Fourteenth   Amendment.      The\r\n\navailability of  an adequate  remedy under  Massachusetts law\r\n\nfor such  a claim,  see,  e.g., Foley v. Polaroid  Corp., 400\r                                                                    \r\n\nMass. 82,  508 N.E.2d 72  (1987), precludes a  procedural due\r\n\nprocess  challenge.  See Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins.\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo., 81 F.3d 249, 256 (1st Cir. 1996).  Further, there exists\r               \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nno  substantive due  process right  to be  free from  such an\r\n\nalleged  deprivation.  See  Albright v. Oliver,  510 U.S. 266\r                                                          \r\n\n(1994) (plurality opinion).\r\n\n          Finally,  appellant cannot state a Fourth Amendment\r\n\nclaim in this case  because he never was arrested  or seized.\r\n\nA   seizure  occurs  \"only  if,   in  view  of   all  of  the\r\n\ncircumstances surrounding the  incident, a reasonable  person\r\n\nwould  have believed that he was not  free to leave.\"  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554 (1980) (Stewart, J.).\r                                \r\n\nThe letter concerning the arrest warrant stated  specifically\r\n\nthat  appellant would be arrested only if he failed to appear\r                                                               \r\n\nat a \"voluntary\" court appearance.  Thus, a reasonable person\r\n\nreading this letter would understand that if he went to court\r\n\non his  own steam, he would  not be arrested.   In any event,\r                                            \r\n\nappellant indicates that he, in fact, freely left the meeting\r\n\nat the Roxbury District Court.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
