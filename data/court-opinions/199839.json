This litigation is a continuation of a\n\nlengthy   marital       campaign   waged     in   the    Massachusetts    state\n\ncourts.      After eleven years of marriage and the birth of three\n\nchildren,     Janet     Guy-Hamilton    sued      her   husband,   William    T.\n\nHamilton (Hamilton) for divorce in the Worcester County Probate\n\nand Family Court in Massachusetts.                 After a protracted and\n\ncontentious trial, the presiding judge, Arline Rotman, granted\n\nthe divorce.       The judge awarded joint legal custody of the\n\nchildren, the central issue in the suit, to both parents, with\n\nphysical custody to the mother.               The judge also ordered the\n\nfather to pay child support and              directed that he pay $10,000\n\ntoward his former wife’s legal fees, because the judge found\n\nthat Hamilton had needlessly protracted the litigation.\n\n             Hamilton appealed to the Massachusetts Appeals Court.\n\nThat court affirmed the judgment of the county court.                    In its\n\ndecision, the appellate court noted that Hamilton appealed from\n\n“every significant aspect” of the judgment of divorce entered by\n\nthe Worcester Probate and Family Court.                 The appellate court’s\n\nreview of the record and arguments of the parties convinced it\n\nthat   the     appeal    lacked    merit.         Hamilton   petitioned      the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court for leave to obtain further\n\nreview.      On July 24, 1995, the Supreme Judicial Court denied\n\nboth the petition for review and a motion for reconsideration.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fWhile the appeals and petition for review were pending in the\n\nMassachusetts appellate courts, the Massachusetts Commission on\n\nJudicial      Conduct    conducted      an   investigation     of   a   complaint\n\nconcerning the improper assignment of the judge to the divorce\n\nsuit, because of her friendship with Joan Arnold (Arnold), the\n\nattorney for Mrs. Hamilton.             The Commission issued its findings\n\non    April    25,    1995,    announcing      that   the    claims     had    been\n\ninvestigated,         computer     records       analyzed,     many     witnesses\n\ninterviewed      and    the     court    files    reviewed,     and     that    the\n\ncomplainant’s allegations were unsubstantiated.\n\n              Following the bitter, hard-fought and lengthy divorce\n\nproceedings in the state courts, Hamilton resourcefully filed\n\nthis action in the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Massachusetts.        In his complaint as amended, he alleged that\n\nthe defendant, Arnold, the attorney who represented his former\n\nwife in their divorce proceedings, conspired with the presiding\n\njudge in that lawsuit to deprive Hamilton of his constitutional\n\nright to a fair divorce trial, in contravention of 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983.    The plaintiff seeks compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nThe   district       court    denied     Arnold’s     motion   to   dismiss     the\n\ncomplaint, finding it “marginally sufficient to state a claim.”\n\nAfter extensive discovery extending over eighteen months, the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fdistrict    court    granted      the    defendant’s      motion    for    summary\n\njudgment.    Hamilton timely appealed.              We affirm.\n\n            Although Hamilton specifically finds fault with several\n\nof the district court’s findings of fact, his basic contention\n\nis that the district court erred in granting summary judgment\n\nbecause there is a genuine issue of material fact that must be\n\nsubmitted    to    the    jury.     As    Hamilton    contends,      this    court\n\nexercises de novo review over the district court’s granting\n\nsummary judgment.          Guzman-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz, 29 F.3d 3, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).         Summary judgment is only appropriate if “the\n\nrecord discloses no trialworthy issue of material fact and the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”\n\nAlexis v. McDonald’s Rests. Inc., 67 F.3d 341, 346 (1 st Cir.\n\n1995).   The record must be viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nthe nonmoving party.         Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).     All reasonable inferences must be accepted in\n\nfavor of the nonmoving party.             Id.\n\n            Hamilton argues that the evidence, when viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to him, is sufficient for a reasonable jury\n\nto infer a conspiracy and that summary judgment therefore was\n\ninappropriate.      Because the sine qua non of a conspiracy, the\n\nagreement,    is    exceedingly         difficult    to   prove    directly,    it\n\nusually must be inferred from the circumstances.                          Earle v.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fBenoit, 850 F.2d 836, 843 (1st Cir. 1988).           Indisputably, there\n\nis no proof of any explicit agreement on the part of the judge\n\nin the divorce proceedings and Arnold to unlawfully grant a\n\nfavorable divorce decree to the former Mrs. Hamilton.                   The\n\nquestion for this court is whether the evidence Hamilton adduced\n\nis   sufficient   for   a   reasonable   jury   to    find   a   conspiracy\n\n“‘without speculation and conjecture.’”              Id. at 844 (quoting\n\nAubin v. Fudala, 782 F.2d 280, 286 (1st Cir. 1986)).               Hamilton\n\nasserts that it was.        The district court held that it was not.\n\n          Hamilton forcefully argues that the due process clause\n\nof the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees him “an impartial and\n\ndisinterested tribunal” in his divorce proceeding.               Marshall v.\n\nJerrico, Inc., 446 U.S. 238, 242 (1980).               Therefore, trials\n\nrequire an absence of actual bias.         In re Murchison, 349 U.S.\n\n133, 136 (1955).        Redress for such a violation is available\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 when the constitutional right is violated\n\nunder color of state law.       A private attorney who conspires with\n\na state judge is within § 1983’s purview.            Casa Marie, Inc. v.\n\nSuperior Court, 988 F.2d 252, 258-59 (1st Cir. 1993).               Because\n\njudges generally enjoy absolute immunity from suits for money\n\ndamages, Mireless v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9 (1991), the plaintiff did\n\nnot name Judge Rotman as a party defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f           Because    the    facts     accumulated     in      the    related\n\nproceedings are very extensive, the plaintiff has reduced them\n\nto six categories, each disputed by the defendant.                   Hamilton\n\nargues that drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in his\n\nfavor, they establish genuine issues of material fact in dispute\n\nsufficient to preclude summary judgment.               The categories as\n\nstated by him are:\n\n      1.   evidence of signaling in the courtroom between the\n           defendant and the presiding judge associated with\n           skewed evidentiary rulings;\n      2.   evidence of improper ex parte meetings between Joan\n           Arnold and the judge, as suggested by the defendant’s\n           regular presence in the judge’s chambers;\n      3.   evidence of improper ex parte communications between\n           the defendant and the judge, as demonstrated by\n           judicial comments on “grandparent intermeddling;”\n      4.   the judge’s improper award of reverse attorney’s fees\n           to the defendant without any proof whatsoever of time\n           expended;\n      5.   the defendant’s and the judge’s denials, during\n           discovery, of maintaining a friendship and socializing\n           with one another, which were contradicted by multiple\n           witnesses and documentary evidence; and\n      6.   testimonial and statistical evidence demonstrating\n           that, contrary to the random judicial assignment\n           system in effect, Arnold tried the vast majority of\n           her contested cases before the presiding judge, rather\n           than appearing randomly before all three judges of the\n           Worcester Probate Court, and had an unusually\n           favorable record with the presiding judge in the\n           Hamilton case.\n\n           The district court here, viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to Hamilton, found that Judge Rotman and\n\nthe   defendant   were     close   personal     friends     who   frequently\n\nassociated   with    one    another.       He   also   found      that   “they\n\n                                     -7-\n\fimproperly flaunted their friendship” and may have engaged in\n\nother    inappropriate         conduct      that    gave    the     appearance      of    a\n\npotential conflict of interest.                   D.C. op. at 9.          However, the\n\ncourt    held    that    the    obvious       friendship          and   appearance       of\n\nimpropriety did not, without more, “constitute circumstantial\n\nevidence of an express or implicit agreement to deprive Hamilton\n\nof a fair proceeding.”           Id.\n\n            At   oral    argument,          Hamilton’s       counsel      stressed       as\n\n“overwhelming” and “powerful” the statistical evidence Hamilton\n\nadduced.    Hamilton claims the statistical evidence proves that\n\nthe judge and the defendant manipulated the trial assignments in\n\nthe     Worcester       Probate       Court        so     that     Arnold      appeared\n\ndisproportionately often in front of Judge Rotman.                             Hamilton\n\nhimself    gathered     the     statistics         by    searching      the   Worcester\n\nCounty    Probate    Court’s      records.              Because    assignments      were\n\nrandom, Hamilton assumed that the defendant should have appeared\n\nbefore two of the court judges about an equal number of times.\n\nHamilton    discovered         that    in    open       court    appearances     Arnold\n\nappeared    before      Judge     Rotman          120    times,     and    before    her\n\ncolleague, Judge Lian, 37 times.                   Although on the surface this\n\ndisparity appears striking, it is less so when examined in the\n\ncontext of actual cases: Judge Rotman was assigned to 36 of\n\nArnold’s cases, while Judge Lian was assigned to 23.                           This 3:2\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fratio is hardly eye-opening, and could result from nothing more\n\nthan    a   simple     stroke    of    circumstance.           Moreover,      assuming\n\narguendo that Arnold’s cases were not randomly assigned, there\n\nis no evidence inculpating Arnold in any manipulation.                             Such\n\nchicanery      can     only     be     inferred        through       conjecture     and\n\nspeculation,      which    are       not    acceptable       bases    for    finding   a\n\nconspiracy.\n\n              Hamilton’s other evidence is similarly unconvincing.\n\nThere are witnesses who testified that the defendant had at\n\ntimes been seen in Judge Rotman’s chambers, but no witnesses saw\n\nthem there together during the trial.                  Hamilton also argues that\n\nJudge       Rotman’s     admonition          to      Hamilton’s       parents     about\n\ndenigrating his former wife in front of their children must have\n\nbeen the result of ex parte communications between the defendant\n\nand the presiding judge.             However, divorces are often bitter, as\n\nwas this one, and children are often used as pawns by one or\n\nboth parents.        The caution to the grandparents is more likely an\n\nexpression of sound advice rather than the result of an ex parte\n\ncommunication.\n\n              Hamilton    further          asserts    that    there    was    improper\n\nsignaling, such as winks and nods, between the judge and Arnold\n\nwhile he was testifying.               Hamilton submitted affidavits from\n\nwitnesses who, in other cases, claimed to have seen similar\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fsignaling between the judge and the defendant.               Such behavior,\n\nif it occurred, is not to be condoned, but without more it is\n\nnot evidence of a conspiracy.              The alleged winks and nods in an\n\nopen court between the judge and a lawyer in a case at trial is\n\nwholly inconsistent with a clandestine conspiracy to subvert the\n\ntrial.     Hamilton alleges that the signaling was followed by\n\n“skewed” evidentiary rulings from the judge, but he has not\n\ndrawn our attention to anything specific or insidious.\n\n            The issue here is not the apparent impropriety of some\n\nof   the   actions      of   the    judge    and   Arnold   in   the   divorce\n\nproceedings, but whether such impropriety proves a conspiracy\n\ndepriving Hamilton of his right to a fair and impartial trial.\n\nHamilton challenged that conduct in the Massachusetts Court of\n\nAppeals    and   that    court     found    it   unsubstantiated.      We   have\n\ncarefully reviewed the record and briefs with respect to all the\n\nallegations.      We are satisfied that no reasonable jury could\n\nhave found a conspiracy between the judge and this defendant on\n\nthe speculative evidence presented by Hamilton, even giving him\n\nthe benefit of all inferences.               Thus, we see no error in the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that “[t]here is simply no evidence of\n\nany ex parte communications regarding Hamilton’s divorce case,\n\nmuch less of an agreement to deprive him of a fair divorce\n\nproceeding.”     (D.C. op. at 9).\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fAffirmed.   Costs taxed against the appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                    -11-\n\f",

Hamilton\n\nargues that drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom in his\n\nfavor, they establish genuine issues of material fact in dispute\n\nsufficient to preclude summary judgment.               The categories as\n\nstated by him are:\n\n      1.   evidence of signaling in the courtroom between the\n           defendant and the presiding judge associated with\n           skewed evidentiary rulings;\n      2.   evidence of improper ex parte meetings between Joan\n           Arnold and the judge, as suggested by the defendant’s\n           regular presence in the judge’s chambers;\n      3.   evidence of improper ex parte communications between\n           the defendant and the judge, as demonstrated by\n           judicial comments on “grandparent intermeddling;”\n      4.   the judge’s improper award of reverse attorney’s fees\n           to the defendant without any proof whatsoever of time\n           expended;\n      5.   the defendant’s and the judge’s denials, during\n           discovery, of maintaining a friendship and socializing\n           with one another, which were contradicted by multiple\n           witnesses and documentary evidence; and\n      6.   testimonial and statistical evidence demonstrating\n           that, contrary to the random judicial assignment\n           system in effect, Arnold tried the vast majority of\n           her contested cases before the presiding judge, rather\n           than appearing randomly before all three judges of the\n           Worcester Probate Court, and had an unusually\n           favorable record with the presiding judge in the\n           Hamilton case.\n\n           The district court here, viewing the evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to Hamilton, found that Judge Rotman and\n\nthe   defendant   were     close   personal     friends     who   frequently\n\nassociated   with    one    another.       He   also   found      that   “they\n\n                                     -7-\n\fimproperly flaunted their friendship” and may have engaged in\n\nother    inappropriate         conduct      that    gave    the     appearance      of    a\n\npotential conflict of interest.                   D.C. op. at 9.          However, the\n\ncourt    held    that    the    obvious       friendship          and   appearance       of\n\nimpropriety did not, without more, “constitute circumstantial\n\nevidence of an express or implicit agreement to deprive Hamilton\n\nof a fair proceeding.”           Id.\n\n            At   oral    argument,          Hamilton’s       counsel      stressed       as\n\n“overwhelming” and “powerful” the statistical evidence Hamilton\n\nadduced.    Hamilton claims the statistical evidence proves that\n\nthe judge and the defendant manipulated the trial assignments in\n\nthe     Worcester       Probate       Court        so     that     Arnold      appeared\n\ndisproportionately often in front of Judge Rotman.                             Hamilton\n\nhimself    gathered     the     statistics         by    searching      the   Worcester\n\nCounty    Probate    Court’s      records.              Because    assignments      were\n\nrandom, Hamilton assumed that the defendant should have appeared\n\nbefore two of the court judges about an equal number of times.\n\nHamilton    discovered         that    in    open       court    appearances     Arnold\n\nappeared    before      Judge     Rotman          120    times,     and    before    her\n\ncolleague, Judge Lian, 37 times.                   Although on the surface this\n\ndisparity appears striking, it is less so when examined in the\n\ncontext of actual cases: Judge Rotman was assigned to 36 of\n\nArnold’s cases, while Judge Lian was assigned to 23.                           This 3:2\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fratio is hardly eye-opening, and could result from nothing more\n\nthan    a   simple     stroke    of    circumstance.           Moreover,      assuming\n\narguendo that Arnold’s cases were not randomly assigned, there\n\nis no evidence inculpating Arnold in any manipulation.                             Such\n\nchicanery      can     only     be     inferred        through       conjecture     and\n\nspeculation,      which    are       not    acceptable       bases    for    finding   a\n\nconspiracy.\n\n              Hamilton’s other evidence is similarly unconvincing.\n\nThere are witnesses who testified that the defendant had at\n\ntimes been seen in Judge Rotman’s chambers, but no witnesses saw\n\nthem there together during the trial.                  Hamilton also argues that\n\nJudge       Rotman’s     admonition          to      Hamilton’s       parents     about\n\ndenigrating his former wife in front of their children must have\n\nbeen the result of ex parte communications between the defendant\n\nand the presiding judge.             However, divorces are often bitter, as\n\nwas this one, and children are often used as pawns by one or\n\nboth parents.        The caution to the grandparents is more likely an\n\nexpression of sound advice rather than the result of an ex parte\n\ncommunication.\n\n              Hamilton    further          asserts    that    there    was    improper\n\nsignaling, such as winks and nods, between the judge and Arnold\n\nwhile he was testifying.               Hamilton submitted affidavits from\n\nwitnesses who, in other cases, claimed to have seen similar\n\n\n                                            -9-\n\fsignaling between the judge and the defendant.               Such behavior,\n\nif it occurred, is not to be condoned, but without more it is\n\nnot evidence of a conspiracy.              The alleged winks and nods in an\n\nopen court between the judge and a lawyer in a case at trial is\n\nwholly inconsistent with a clandestine conspiracy to subvert the\n\ntrial.     Hamilton alleges that the signaling was followed by\n\n“skewed” evidentiary rulings from the judge, but he has not\n\ndrawn our attention to anything specific or insidious.\n\n            The issue here is not the apparent impropriety of some\n\nof   the   actions      of   the    judge    and   Arnold   in   the   divorce\n\nproceedings, but whether such impropriety proves a conspiracy\n\ndepriving Hamilton of his right to a fair and impartial trial.\n\nHamilton challenged that conduct in the Massachusetts Court of\n\nAppeals    and   that    court     found    it   unsubstantiated.      We   have\n\ncarefully reviewed the record and briefs with respect to all the\n\nallegations.      We are satisfied that no reasonable jury could\n\nhave found a conspiracy between the judge and this defendant on\n\nthe speculative evidence presented by Hamilton, even giving him\n\nthe benefit of all inferences.               Thus, we see no error in the\n\ndistrict court’s finding that “[t]here is simply no evidence of\n\nany ex parte communications regarding Hamilton’s divorce case,\n\nmuch less of an agreement to deprive him of a fair divorce\n\nproceeding.”     (D.C. op. at 9).\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fAffirmed.
