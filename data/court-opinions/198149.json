Mahoney, Acting General\r\nCounsel, Jacob H. Stillman, Associate General Counsel, Diane V.\r\nWhite, Senior Counsel, and Paul Gonson, Solicitor, were on brief\r\nfor appellee.  \r\n\nOctober 5, 1998\r\n\nBOUDIN, Circuit Judge.  This difficult case concerns a\r\npreliminary injunction obtained by the Securities and Exchange\r\nCommission to freeze certain assets in the brokerage account of\r\nEmanuel Pinez who (according to the SEC) secured those assets\r\nthrough unlawful insider trading.  The assets were held in Pinez's\r\nbrokerage account with Lehman Brothers, Inc., which claimed an\r\noverriding security interest in the assets.  Having failed to\r\npersuade the district court on this point, Lehman Brothers now\r\nappeals.\r\nThe background facts are essentially undisputed.  Pinez,\r\nwho was chairman of Centennial Technology, Inc., opened a personal\r\nbrokerage account with Lehman Brothers in February 1996.  Frederick\r\nE. Pierce II became Pinez's account representative at Lehman\r\nBrothers.  In September 1996, Pinez executed a margin account\r\nagreement with Lehman Brothers (explicitly to be governed by New\r\nYork law); the agreement permitted him to borrow from Lehman\r\nBrothers to cover a portion of the cost of his purchases.  The\r\nagreement also gave Lehman Brothers a security interest as\r\ncollateral for any margin debt in all assets held in the account. \r\nDuring 1996, Centennial stock performed remarkably well,\r\nreaching a high of $58 per share in December 1996.  According to\r\nthe SEC, the reason was fraudulent bookkeeping by Pinez, including\r\nfictitious sales and inventory figures.  Indeed, after the events\r\nto be recounted, the company revised its financial statements to\r\nshow a $28 million loss for the three-and-a-half years ending in\r\nDecember 1996, rather than the $12 million profit originally\r\nreported.\r\nWell before this public restatement, reports began to\r\nappear in newspapers in January and February 1997, suggesting\r\ndoubts about Centennial's earnings and management.  Throughout\r\nJanuary 1997, the price of Centennial stock fell, reaching $23.75\r\non January 31, 1997.  On February 5, 1997, Centennial's board of\r\ndirectors set up a special committee to investigate the company's\r\nearnings, and the vice chairman of the board told Pinez the next\r\nday that Pinez would likely have to leave if the company had to\r\nrestate its earnings.\r\nOn February 7, 1997, Pinez called Pierce and directed him\r\nto arrange a \"zero-cost collar\" on Centennial stock owned by Pinez;\r\nPinez then had almost $10 million in Centennial stock (at then-\r\ncurrent market prices) in his Lehman Brothers account.  Pinez's\r\napparent purpose was to ensure that he would have the necessary\r\nfunds to cover his $5 million margin-account debt with Lehman\r\nBrothers even if the market price of his Centennial-stock\r\ncollateral fell sharply and led Lehman Brothers to demand immediate\r\npayment of the debt, as it was entitled to do under the margin\r\naccount agreement.\r\nA zero-cost collar involves two contemporaneous\r\ntransactions: the sale (here, by Pinez) of call options, giving the\r\noption buyers the right to purchase from the seller up to a certain\r\namount of the stock at a fixed price, and the purchase (again by\r\nPinez) of an equal number of put options, giving the buyer the\r\nright to sell a similar amount of stock to the sellers of the puts\r\nat some future period at a similar or closely related fixed price. \r\nWhat matters here is that the put options that Pinez acquired\r\nbecame assets held in his Lehman Brothers margin account.\r\nWhen Pinez called Pierce on February 7, 1997, Pierce\r\nasked whether Pinez was in a \"quiet period,\" during which he would\r\nbe precluded from trading in Centennial securities; Pinez said that\r\nhe was not.  Pierce then obtained the necessary approvals from\r\nLehman Brothers.  Pierce filled the order the same afternoon,\r\nselling 2700 Centennial \"call\" options and purchasing 2700\r\nCentennial \"put\" options.  At this time, Pinez's account at Lehman\r\nBrothers held securities (mostly Centennial stock) providing barely\r\nadequate collateral for Pinez's total margin debt.\r\nWhatever Lehman Brothers should or might have suspected\r\non February 7, 1997, there is no claim by the SEC that Lehman\r\nBrothers knew at that time either that Pinez had falsified\r\nCentennial's financial statements or that this possibility was\r\nunder investigation by Centennial's board.  However, on February\r\n11, 1997, Centennial announced publicly that it was undertaking an\r\ninquiry into its earlier financial statements, that it had removed\r\nPinez from its management, and that the New York Stock Exchange had\r\nsuspended trading in Centennial stock.  Lehman Brothers issued an\r\nimmediate margin call demanding that Pinez pay it all outstanding\r\nmargin debt, then more than $6 million.  Pinez failed to do so. \r\nLehman Brothers now had a contractual claim against Pinez for his\r\nmargin debt, a claim Lehman Brothers much later reduced to a state-\r\ncourt judgment.\r\nIn the meantime, one of the valuable assets in the Pinez\r\naccount was the 2700 put contracts giving Pinez as put owner the\r\nright to make the unfortunate put sellers pay $20 per share for\r\nCentennial stock now worth much less.  Before Lehman Brothers could\r\ntake advantage of this opportunity to dispose of its security, the\r\nSEC on February 14, 1997, brought the present civil action in the\r\ndistrict court and obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order\r\n\"freezing\" all assets in Pinez accounts with various financial\r\ninstitutions, including Lehman Brothers.  The government also began\r\ncriminal proceedings against Pinez.\r\nThe SEC's civil action, out of which the present appeal\r\ngrows, charged Pinez with having secured the put options through\r\nthe unlawful use of inside information--specifically, knowledge\r\nthat Centennial's financial health was much worse than publicly\r\nknown--in violation of various securities law requirements,\r\nprimarily section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15\r\nU.S.C.  78j(b).  Lehman Brothers was later named in an amended\r\ncomplaint as a \"relief defendant.\"  One object of the complaint was\r\nto require \"disgorgement\" by Pinez of his \"ill-gotten gains,\"\r\nincluding the put options that are the subject of this case.  By\r\nagreement of the parties, the put options were liquidated before\r\nthey expired, so the controversy is now about the proceeds.\r\nFollowing the grant of the temporary restraining order,\r\nthe district court held a hearing on March 6, 1997, on the SEC's\r\nrequest to transform the now expired TRO into a preliminary\r\ninjunction.  Despite the expiration of the TRO, Lehman Brothers, as\r\na courtesy to the court, agreed to maintain the proceeds derived\r\nfrom the put options in an escrow account while the court\r\nconsidered the SEC's motion.  Those proceeds now represent almost\r\n$5 million, which Lehman Brothers says is barely enough to cover\r\nthe still unpaid portion of Pinez's margin-account debt.\r\nOn December 16, 1997, the district court released a\r\nmemorandum and order granting the instant preliminary injunction\r\ninsofar as  it maintained a freeze on Pinez's assets, including the\r\nput option proceeds held in escrow by Lehman Brothers.  SEC v.\r\nPinez, 989 F. Supp. 325 (D. Mass. 1997).  After detailed analysis\r\nof federal and state law, the court concluded that at trial the SEC\r\nwas likely to establish not only that Pinez had committed fraud in\r\nacquiring the put options, but also that \"Lehman [Brothers] is not\r\na bona fide purchaser of those securities . . . .\"  Id. at 345. \r\nThis appeal followed.\r\nIn this court, Lehman Brothers has assumed that but for\r\nits asserted security interest in the margin account assets, the\r\nSEC would have a valid claim to recoup the proceeds as the product\r\nof an unlawful transaction by Pinez (the put options purchases). \r\nConversely, the SEC has assumed that its claim to the proceeds is\r\nsubordinated if Lehman Brothers is treated as a bona fide purchaser\r\nof the put options for value; the SEC does not dispute that Lehman\r\nBrothers should be treated as a purchaser for value, and the\r\nrelevant law supports this concession.\r\nAccordingly, the dispute--as framed by the parties--is\r\nwhether Lehman Brothers is a bona fide purchaser.  We accept the\r\nassumptions of the parties but do not independently endorse them. \r\nCf. In re Newport Plaza Assoc. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank, 985 F.2d\r\n640, 643-44 (1st Cir. 1993).  As to the law governing Lehman\r\nBrothers' status as a bona fide purchaser, the SEC regards the\r\nissue as governed by New York law, while Lehman Brothers invokes\r\nfederal securities law.  We address the legal issues in that order.\r\nNew York law is a sound starting point because in this\r\ninstance, as in most commercial transactions, state law provides\r\nthe matrix of background rules and is ordinarily displaced, if at\r\nall, only by conflicting or field-occupying provisions of federal\r\nstatutory law, or occasionally by federal common law.  See Attertonv. FDIC, 519 U.S. 213 (1997); Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum\r\nCorp., 384 U.S. 63, 68 (1966).  Here, the margin account agreement\r\nrelied on by Lehman Brothers for its priority is expressly governed\r\nby New York law.\r\nThe parties agree that save as federal law may dictate\r\notherwise, Lehman Brothers' rights to the proceeds vis-a-vis  the\r\nSEC are controlled by article 8 of New York's Uniform Commercial\r\nCode, N.Y.U.C.C.  8-301 et seq. (McKinney 1987).  Article 8\r\ngoverns investment securities, and section 8-302 defines a \"bona\r\nfide purchaser\" as \"a purchaser for value in good faith and without\r\nnotice of any adverse claim\" who obtains a security (under certain\r\nspecified conditions which the SEC here assumes to have been\r\nsatisfied).  Section 8-302(3) then provides: \"A bona fide purchaser\r\nin addition to acquiring the rights of a purchaser (Section 8-301)\r\nalso acquires his interest in the security free of any adverse\r\nclaim.\"\r\n\"Adverse claim\" is defined in fairly general terms (in\r\nsection 8-302(2)) but we need not pursue the subject because the\r\nSEC appears to assume that its own claim for \"disgorgement\" of the\r\nput options (or their proceeds) constitutes an adverse claim that\r\nwould not prevail against a bona fide purchaser.  Instead, it says\r\nthat it is entitled to prevail over Lehman Brothers because Lehman\r\nBrothers, even though a \"purchaser for value,\" was not one \"in good\r\nfaith and without notice of any adverse claim.\"  N.Y.U.C.C.  8-\r\n302.\r\nThe factual predicate for the SEC's position is that\r\nPinez was known to be an insider, he was engaging in a transaction\r\nthat made a good deal of sense if one expected a dip in the price\r\nof his stock, and there was some public information suggesting that\r\nthe company might be in more difficulty than its past financial\r\nreports would indicate.  These facts are undisputed and we will\r\nassume, in unison with the SEC, that they amply amount to\r\nsuspicious circumstances that should have alerted Lehman Brothers\r\nto the possibility of trouble.\r\nThe key to the SEC's legal argument is that Lehman\r\nBrothers' disregard of \"suspicious circumstances\" deprives it of\r\nbona fide purchaser status (Lehman Brothers did make a brief\r\ninquiry of Pinez as already recounted, but no more).  In the words\r\nof the district court, which took a similar view of New York law,\r\n\"a failure to act on actual knowledge of suspicious circumstances\r\nconstitutes bad faith on the part of a lienholder\" and thereby\r\ndefeats a claim of bona fide purchaser status. Pinez, 989 F. Supp.\r\nat 344.  Lehman Brothers, by contrast, asserts in its brief that\r\nunder New York's UCC, \"good faith\" is \"entirely 'subjective,' andthat it excludes any duty of inquiry.\"\r\nWe adopt neither position outright, but think that the\r\nlaw is closer to Lehman Brothers' view.  In our view, the emphasis\r\nin the New York case law is on subjective bad faith and\r\ndishonesty, an emphasis echoed in parallel provisions of section\r\n3-304 which--in relation to commercial paper--describe notice of a\r\nclaim or defense as including \"knowledge of such facts that his\r\naction in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.\"  N.Y.U.C.C.\r\n3-304(7) (McKinney 1987).  Although the case law provides the\r\ndecisive gloss, plain language confirms it: in ordinary parlance,\r\none can certainly be \"suspicious,\" without being dishonest, in\r\ndeciding to proceed with a transaction where suspicions are\r\noutweighed by competing considerations.\r\nNew York has deliberately adopted a standard somewhat\r\nmore favorable to the recipient of the securities than have a\r\nnumber of other states.  As New York's highest court has noted, New\r\nYork and Virginia are the only states to insist that notice \"be\r\ndetermined by a subjective test of actual knowledge.\"  Hartford,\r\n542 N.E.2d at 1094; see also Chemical Bank, 411 N.E.2d at 341; cf.Lawton v. Walker, 343 S.E.2d 335, 337-38 (Va. 1986) (construing the\r\nparallel provision of the Virginia UCC  8.3-304).  Where one draws\r\nthe line, in requiring more or less inquiry by the purchaser, is a\r\npolicy choice; the New York legislature could plausibly choose to\r\nfacilitate stock transactions by limiting the obligation to inquire\r\nand giving bona fide purchaser status a generous reach.\r\nThe SEC points to cases that forbid someone from\r\ndeliberately averting his eyes from evident misconduct.  We agree\r\nthat such conduct, even if literally short of actual knowledge,\r\ncould fairly be equated with dishonesty or bad faith.  But there is\r\nnothing in the facts before us to suggest that Pinez's use of a\r\n\"collar\" transaction could only be explained by the use of inside\r\ninformation.  Nor has the SEC shown that Lehman Brothers\r\ndeliberately closed its eyes to some easily obtained information\r\nthat would have confirmed that Pinez was engaging in securities\r\nfraud.  \r\nIndeed, we can imagine in extreme circumstances imputing\r\nbad faith to a purchaser who had very strong suspicions of grave\r\nmisconduct, who could readily have verified or dispelled the\r\nsuspicion, and who failed to do so without any plausible excuse. \r\nTo this limited extent, there may be a duty of inquiry where a\r\nfailure to inquire amounts to bad faith.  But here, misconduct was\r\nmerely a possibility; Lehman Brothers had been directed to execute\r\nan immediate transaction, and the SEC does not suggest how it could\r\nhave swiftly and definitely assured itself that no insider\r\ninformation had been used.\r\nTaking New York law to require dishonesty and not mere\r\nsuspicion, and applying that standard to the facts currently of\r\nrecord, we do not think that the SEC has shown a reasonable\r\nlikelihood of prevailing against Lehman Brothers on the merits. \r\nThis disagreement with the able district judge rests primarily on\r\nour reading of New York law which we assess de novo.  Of course,\r\nthe present record does not reflect an evidentiary hearing, let\r\nalone a full trial; whether eventually the SEC might adduce more\r\nfacts that would meet the dishonesty standard is another matter.\r\nThis brings us to the question whether federal law\r\nsupersedes state law, either in favor of Lehman Brothers or in\r\nfavor of the SEC.  Lehman Brothers relies on two provisions of the\r\nfederal securities law, which it reads as saying that only \"actual\r\nknowledge\" of Pinez's violation would impair its security interest. \r\nConversely, the district judge, but not the SEC, thinks that a\r\nthird provision of the federal securities laws makes suspicious\r\ncircumstances enough.  We think that none of the three provisions\r\ncited alters the result in this case.\r\nLehman Brothers first relies upon section 29(b) of the\r\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.  78cc(b).  In pertinent\r\npart, section 29(b) provides as follows:\r\n     Every contract made in violation of any\r\nprovision of this chapter . . . shall be void\r\n(1) as regards to the rights of any person\r\nwho, in violation of any such provision . . .\r\nshall have made or engaged in the performance\r\nof any such contract, and (2) as regards to\r\nthe rights of any person who, not being a\r\nparty to such contract, shall have acquired\r\nany right thereunder with actual knowledge of\r\nthe facts by reason of which the making or\r\nperformance of such contract was in violation\r\nof any such provision . . . .\r\n\nRelying on subsection (2), Lehman Brothers argues that the \"actual\r\nknowledge\" requirement controls, with no ifs or buts based on\r\nsuspicious circumstances.\r\nWe will assume without deciding that Lehman Brothers is\r\nright in its reading of the phrase \"actual knowledge.\"  We will\r\nalso assume that Lehman Brothers is a person who, \"not being a\r\nparty\" to such put option contracts, acquired a right thereunder,\r\nnamely, the right as successor to Pinez to enforce the put options\r\ncontracts.  It therefore would follow from these (untested)\r\nassumptions that Lehman Brothers could defeat any claim under\r\nsection 29(b) by the put options sellers that, because of Pinez's\r\nviolation, the contracts were \"void.\"\r\nBut subsections (1) and (2) are merely limitations on the\r\nconsequences that would otherwise be visited by the principal\r\ndirective of section 29(b), namely, that the options contracts\r\nwould be voidable under federal law.  No one, including the SEC,\r\nsays that Lehman Brothers cannot enforce the options contracts, as\r\nit has already done in liquidating them.  Instead, the SEC is\r\nchallenging Lehman Brothers' security interest in the proceeds\r\ncreated by the margin agreement and is arguing that that security\r\ninterest, created by New York law, is also undermined by New York\r\nlaw because of Lehman Brothers' alleged bad faith.\r\nIf there were conflict between section 29(b) and New York\r\nlaw, the latter would give way under the Supremacy Clause.  There\r\nis no such conflict.  Section 29(b) is a federal law that makes the\r\nput option contracts unenforceable by the buyer against the seller\r\nwhere acquired through the buyer's violation of \"this chapter\"\r\n(presumably, Lehman Brothers was rescued by subsection (b)(2)). \r\nThe New York UCC provision relied on by the SEC does not contradict\r\nthis outcome; it merely gives the SEC an independent ground under\r\nNew York law for saying that Lehman Brothers has no valid security\r\ninterest, a security interest that Lehman Brothers itself assumes\r\nit needs in order to prevail over the SEC.\r\nLehman Brothers' other resort is to section 29(c)(1), 15\r\nU.S.C.  78cc(c), which in pertinent part provides as follows:\r\n     Nothing in this chapter shall be\r\nconstrued (1) to affect the validity . . . .\r\nof any lien . . . unless at the time of . . .\r\nthe creating of such lien, the person . . .\r\nacquiring such lien shall have actual\r\nknowledge of facts by reason of which . . .\r\nthe acquisition of such lien is a violation of\r\nthe provisions of this chapter . . . . or (2)\r\nto afford a defense to . . . the enforcement\r\nof any lien by any person who shall have\r\nacquired such . . . lien in good faith for\r\nvalue and without actual knowledge of the\r\nviolation of any provision of this chapter . .\r\n. .\r\n\nThe literal language of subsection (1) is no help to Lehman\r\nBrothers since it merely protects the lien (i.e., the security\r\ninterest) against any provision of the Securities Exchange Act that\r\nmight otherwise be taken to invalidate it.  Here, the SEC is\r\nrelying upon provisions of the New York UCC--not \"this chapter\"--so\r\nthe quoted language of section 29(c) does not by its terms apply.\r\nTo be sure, in unusual circumstances a federal statute\r\nlike section 29(c)(1) might be judicially expanded to protect the\r\nvalidity of the favored lien not just against the provisions of\r\n\"this chapter\" but against invalidation on any basis; literal\r\nlanguage does not always prevail.  Cf. Church of Holy Trinity v.\r\nUnited States, 143 U.S. 457 (1892).  But it would require a\r\nremarkable showing to persuade a court to read out of the statute\r\nthe explicit limiting phrase (\"in this chapter\").  No such argument\r\nhas even been attempted by Lehman Brothers.\r\nFor a similar reason, we think that the district court\r\nread too broadly the subsection (2) of the same section 29(c),\r\nquoted above, which says that the Securities Exchange Act shall not\r\nbe read to give a defense to enforcement of a lien where the lien\r\nholder acquired it \"in good faith for value and without actual\r\nknowledge\" of any violation of that statute.  The district court\r\ntook this provision to mean--apparently without support from the\r\nSEC--that \"federal law governs Lehman's status as a bona fide\r\npurchaser in an action to enforce its lien.\"  989 F. Supp. at 343. \r\nYet read literally, section 29(c)(2) is concerned only with the\r\npossible use of the federal statute, not New York law, to\r\ninvalidate a lien.\r\nFurther, section 29(c)(2) does not by itself purport to\r\ninvalidate any lien: it merely provides a defense to lien\r\ninvalidation under certain circumstances.  The possible reach of\r\nthe defense is beside the point unless and until someone makes out\r\na claim of invalidity, and the only effort to do so here--the SEC's\r\nclaim of invalidity under New York law--has thus far fallen short. \r\nWe leave for another day the interesting question whether the\r\ndefense could ever operate where the attack on a lien was premised\r\nprimarily upon state law and where state law invalidated a lien\r\neven of a good faith purchaser for value without actual knowledge\r\nof the securities-law violation. \r\nOrdinarily, our reasoning would lead us to vacate the\r\npreliminary injunction at once.  However, the put options have been\r\nreduced to a sum of money being held by Lehman Brothers in escrow,\r\nand there is no obvious harm to Lehman Brothers in maintaining the\r\nescrow in the short run.  Possibly (the issue has not been argued)\r\nthe SEC's ability to obtain \"disgorgement\" of these proceeds\r\ndepends on the separate maintenance of this concrete stake, since\r\nthere is no claim that Lehman Brothers itself violated the\r\nsecurities laws.\r\nOn remand, the district court can ascertain whether or\r\nnot the SEC desires to pursue its disgorgement claim in light of\r\nour reading of New York law.  If so, the district court can also\r\ndecide whether the preliminary injunction is needed to avoid\r\nmooting the case; if there is such a need, and some prospect of\r\nsuccess, the district court may choose to maintain the preliminary\r\ninjunction, pending a prompt trial.  See Washington Metro. Area\r\nTransit Comm'n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 844-45 (D.C.\r\nCir. 1977).\r\nAccordingly, the matter is remanded for further\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n",

Indeed, after the events to be recounted, the company revised its financial statements to show a $28 million loss for the three-and-a-half years ending in December 1996, rather than the $12 million profit originally reported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Well before this public restatement, reports began to appear in newspapers in January and February 1997, suggesting doubts about Centennial's earnings and management.  Throughout January 1997, the price of Centennial stock fell, reaching $23.75 on January 31, 1997.  On February 5, 1997, Centennial's board of directors set up a special committee to investigate the company's earnings, and the vice chairman of the board told Pinez the next day that Pinez would likely have to leave if the company had to restate its earnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7, 1997, Pinez called Pierce and directed him to arrange a \"zero-cost collar\" on Centennial stock owned by Pinez;  Pinez then had almost $10 million in Centennial stock (at thencurrent market prices) in his Lehman Brothers account.  Pinez's apparent purpose was to ensure that he would have the necessary funds to cover his $5 million margin-account debt with Lehman Brothers even if the market price of his Centennial-stock collateral fell sharply and led Lehman Brothers to demand immediate payment of the debt, as it was entitled to do under the margin account agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A zero-cost collar involves two contemporaneous transactions:  the sale (here, by Pinez) of call options, giving the option buyers the right to purchase from the seller up to a certain amount of the stock at a fixed price, and the purchase (again by Pinez) of an equal number of put options, giving the buyer the right to sell a similar amount of stock to the sellers of the puts at some future period at a similar or closely related fixed price.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  What matters here is that the put options that Pinez acquired became assets held in his Lehman Brothers margin account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Pinez called Pierce on February 7, 1997, Pierce asked whether Pinez was in a \"quiet period,\" during which he would be precluded from trading in Centennial securities;  Pinez said that he was not.  Pierce then obtained the necessary approvals from Lehman Brothers.  Pierce filled the order the same afternoon, selling 2700 Centennial \"call\" options and purchasing 2700 Centennial \"put\" options.  At this time, Pinez's account at Lehman Brothers held securities (mostly Centennial stock) providing barely adequate collateral for Pinez's total margin debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever Lehman Brothers should or might have suspected on February 7, 1997, there is no claim by the SEC that Lehman Brothers knew at that time either that Pinez had falsified Centennial's financial statements or that this possibility was under investigation by Centennial's board.  However, on February 11, 1997, Centennial announced publicly that it was undertaking an inquiry into its earlier financial statements, that it had removed Pinez from its management, and that the New York Stock Exchange had suspended trading in Centennial stock.  Lehman Brothers issued an immediate margin call demanding that Pinez pay it all outstanding margin debt, then more than $6 million.  Pinez failed to do so.  Lehman Brothers now had a contractual claim against Pinez for his margin debt, a claim Lehman Brothers much later reduced to a state-court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, one of the valuable assets in the Pinez account was the 2700 put contracts giving Pinez as put owner the right to make the unfortunate put sellers pay $20 per share for Centennial stock now worth much less.  Before Lehman Brothers could take advantage of this opportunity to dispose of its security, the SEC on February 14, 1997, brought the present civil action in the district court and obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order \"freezing\" all assets in Pinez accounts with various financial institutions, including Lehman Brothers.  The government also began criminal proceedings against Pinez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SEC's civil action, out of which the present appeal grows, charged Pinez with having secured the put options through the unlawful use of inside information--specifically, knowledge that Centennial's financial health was much worse than publicly known--in violation of various securities law requirements, primarily section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b).  Lehman Brothers was later named in an amended complaint as a \"relief defendant.\"   One object of the complaint was to require \"disgorgement\" by Pinez of his \"ill-gotten gains,\" including the put options that are the subject of this case.  By agreement of the parties, the put options were liquidated before they expired, so the controversy is now about the proceeds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the grant of the temporary restraining order, the district court held a hearing on March 6, 1997, on the SEC's request to transform the now expired TRO into a preliminary injunction.  Despite the expiration of the TRO, Lehman Brothers, as a courtesy to the court, agreed to maintain the proceeds derived from the put options in an escrow account while the court considered the SEC's motion.  Those proceeds now represent almost $5 million, which Lehman Brothers says is barely enough to cover the still unpaid portion of Pinez's margin-account debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, 1997, the district court released a memorandum and order granting the instant preliminary injunction insofar as it maintained a freeze on Pinez's assets, including the put option proceeds held in escrow by Lehman Brothers.  SEC v. Pinez, 989 F.Supp. 325 (D.Mass.1997).  After detailed analysis of federal and state law, the court concluded that at trial the SEC was likely to establish not only that Pinez had committed fraud in acquiring the put options, but also that \"Lehman [Brothers] is not a bona fide purchaser of those securities....\"  Id. at 345.   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, Lehman Brothers has assumed that but for its asserted security interest in the margin account assets, the SEC would have a valid claim to recoup the proceeds as the product of an unlawful transaction by Pinez (the put options purchases).  Conversely, the SEC has assumed that its claim to the proceeds is subordinated if Lehman Brothers is treated as a bona fide purchaser of the put options for value;  the SEC does not dispute that Lehman Brothers should be treated as a purchaser for value, and the relevant law supports this concession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the dispute--as framed by the parties--is whether Lehman Brothers is a bona fide purchaser.  We accept the assumptions of the parties but do not independently endorse them.  Cf. In re Newport Plaza Assoc. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank, 985 F.2d 640, 643-44 (1st Cir.1993).  As to the law governing Lehman Brothers' status as a bona fide purchaser, the SEC regards the issue as governed by New York law, while Lehman Brothers invokes federal securities law.  We address the legal issues in that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New York law is a sound starting point because in this instance, as in most commercial transactions, state law provides the matrix of background rules and is ordinarily displaced, if at all, only by conflicting, field-occupying provisions of federal statutory law, or occasionally by federal common law.  See Atherton v. FDIC, 519 U.S. 213, 117 S.Ct. 666, 136 L.Ed.2d 656 (1997);  Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U.S. 63, 68, 86 S.Ct. 1301, 16 L.Ed.2d 369 (1966).  Here, the margin account agreement relied on by Lehman Brothers for its priority is expressly governed by New York law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that save as federal law may dictate otherwise, Lehman Brothers' rights to the proceeds vis-a-vis the SEC are controlled by article 8 of New York's Uniform Commercial Code, N.Y.U.C.C. &#167; 8-301 et seq.  (McKinney 1987).  Article 8 governs investment securities, and section 8-302 defines a \"bona fide purchaser\" as \"a purchaser for value in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim\" who obtains a security (under certain specified conditions which the SEC here assumes to have been satisfied).  Section 8-302(3) then provides:  \"A bona fide purchaser in addition to acquiring the rights of a purchaser (Section 8-301) also acquires his interest in the security free of any adverse claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Adverse claim\" is defined in fairly general terms (in section 8-302(2)) but we need not pursue the subject because the SEC appears to assume that its own claim for \"disgorgement\" of the put options (or their proceeds) constitutes an adverse claim that would not prevail against a bona fide purchaser.  Instead, it says that it is entitled to prevail over Lehman Brothers because Lehman Brothers, even though a \"purchaser for value,\" was not one \"in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim.\"  N.Y.U.C.C. &#167; 8-302.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual predicate for the SEC's position is that Pinez was known to be an insider, he was engaging in a transaction that made a good deal of sense if one expected a dip in the price of his stock, and there was some public information suggesting that the company might be in more difficulty than its past financial reports would indicate.  These facts are undisputed and we will assume, in unison with the SEC, that they amply amount to suspicious circumstances that should have alerted Lehman Brothers to the possibility of trouble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key to the SEC's legal argument is that Lehman Brothers' disregard of \"suspicious circumstances\" deprives it of bona fide purchaser status (Lehman Brothers did make a brief inquiry of Pinez as already recounted, but no more).  In the words of the district court, which took a similar view of New York law, \"a failure to act on actual knowledge of suspicious circumstances constitutes bad faith on the part of a lienholder\" and thereby defeats a claim of bona fide purchaser status.  Pinez, 989 F.Supp. at 344.   Lehman Brothers, by contrast, asserts in its brief that under New York's UCC, \"good faith\" is \"entirely 'subjective,' and that it excludes any duty of inquiry.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We adopt neither position outright, but think that the law is closer to Lehman Brothers' view.  In our view, the emphasis in the New York case law is on subjective bad faith and dishonesty,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> an emphasis echoed in parallel provisions of section 3-304 which--in relation to commercial paper--describe notice of a claim or defense as including \"knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.\"  N.Y.U.C.C. &#167; 3-304(7) (McKinney 1987).  Although the case law provides the decisive gloss, plain language confirms it:  in ordinary parlance, one can certainly be \"suspicious\" without being dishonest in deciding to proceed with a transaction where suspicions are outweighed by competing considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New York has deliberately adopted a standard somewhat more favorable to the recipient of the securities than have a number of other states.  As New York's highest court has noted, New York and Virginia are the only states to insist that notice \"be determined by a subjective test of actual knowledge.\"  Hartford, 544 N.Y.S.2d 573, 542 N.E.2d at 1094;  see also Chemical Bank, 411 N.E.2d at 1341;  cf.  Lawton v. Walker, 231 Va. 247, 343 S.E.2d 335, 337-38 (Va.1986) (construing the parallel provision of the Virginia UCC &#167; 8.3-304).  Where one draws the line in requiring more or less inquiry by the purchaser is a policy choice;  the New York legislature could plausibly choose to facilitate stock transactions by limiting the obligation to inquire and giving bona fide purchaser status a generous reach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SEC points to cases that forbid someone from deliberately averting his eyes from evident misconduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We agree that such conduct, even if literally short of actual knowledge, could fairly be equated with dishonesty or bad faith.  But there is nothing in the facts before us to suggest that Pinez's use of a \"collar\" transaction could only be explained by the use of inside information.  Nor has the SEC shown that Lehman Brothers deliberately closed its eyes to some easily obtained information that would have confirmed that Pinez was engaging in securities fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, we can imagine in extreme circumstances imputing bad faith to a purchaser who had very strong suspicions of grave misconduct, who could readily have verified or dispelled the suspicion, and who failed to do so without any plausible excuse.  To this limited extent, there may be a duty of inquiry where a failure to inquire amounts to bad faith.  But here, misconduct was merely a possibility;  Lehman Brothers had been directed to execute an immediate transaction, and the SEC does not suggest how it could have swiftly and definitely assured itself that no insider information had been used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking New York law to require dishonesty and not mere suspicion, and applying that standard to the facts currently of record, we do not think that the SEC has shown a reasonable likelihood of prevailing against Lehman Brothers on the merits.  This disagreement with the able district judge rests primarily on our reading of New York law, which we assess de novo.   Of course, the present record does not reflect an evidentiary hearing, let alone a full trial;  whether eventually the SEC might adduce more facts that would meet the dishonesty standard is another matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the question whether federal law supersedes state law, either in favor of Lehman Brothers or in favor of the SEC. Lehman Brothers relies on two provisions of the federal securities law, which it reads as saying that only \"actual knowledge\" of Pinez's violation would impair its security interest.  Conversely, the district judge, but not the SEC, thinks that a third provision of the federal securities laws makes suspicious circumstances enough.  We think that none of the three provisions cited alters the result in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lehman Brothers first relies upon section 29(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78cc(b).  In pertinent part, section 29(b) provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every contract made in violation of any provision of this chapter ... shall be void (1) as regards to the rights of any person who, in violation of any such provision ... shall have made or engaged in the performance of any such contract, and (2) as regards to the rights of any person who, not being a party to such contract, shall have acquired any right thereunder with actual knowledge of the facts by reason of which the making or performance of such contract was in violation of any such provision....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on subsection (2), Lehman Brothers argues that the \"actual knowledge\" requirement controls, with no ifs or buts based on suspicious circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume without deciding that Lehman Brothers is right in its reading of the phrase \"actual knowledge.\"   We will also assume that Lehman Brothers is a person who, \"not being a party\" to such put option contracts, acquired a right thereunder, namely, the right as successor to Pinez to enforce the put options contracts.  It therefore would follow from these (untested) assumptions that Lehman Brothers could defeat any claim under section 29(b) by the put options sellers that, because of Pinez's violation, the contracts were \"void.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But subsections (1) and (2) are merely limitations on the consequences that would otherwise be visited by the principal directive of section 29(b), namely, that the options contracts would be voidable under federal law.  No one, including the SEC, says that Lehman Brothers cannot enforce the options contracts, as it has already done in liquidating them.  Instead, the SEC is challenging Lehman Brothers' security interest in the proceeds created by the margin agreement and is arguing that that security interest, created by New York law, is also undermined by New York law because of Lehman Brothers' alleged bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there were conflict between section 29(b) and New York law, the latter would give way under the Supremacy Clause.  There is no such conflict.  Section 29(b) is a federal law that makes the put option contracts unenforceable by the buyer against the seller where acquired through the buyer's violation of \"this chapter\" (presumably, Lehman Brothers was rescued by subsection (b)(2)).  The New York UCC provision relied on by the SEC does not contradict this outcome;  it merely gives the SEC an independent ground under New York law for saying that Lehman Brothers has no valid security interest, a security interest that Lehman Brothers itself assumes it needs in order to prevail over the SEC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lehman Brothers' other resort is to section 29(c)(1), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78cc(c), which in pertinent part provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed (1) to affect the validity .... of any lien ... unless at the time of ... the creating of such lien, the person ... acquiring such lien shall have actual knowledge of facts by reason of which ... the acquisition of such lien is a violation of the provisions of this chapter .... or (2) to afford a defense to ... the enforcement of any lien by any person who shall have acquired such ... lien in good faith for value and without actual knowledge of the violation of any provision of this chapter....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The literal language of subsection (1) is no help to Lehman Brothers since it merely protects the lien (i.e., the security interest) against any provision of the Securities Exchange Act that might otherwise be taken to invalidate it.  Here, the SEC is relying upon provisions of the New York UCC--not \"this chapter\"--so the quoted language of section 29(c) does not by its terms apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, in unusual circumstances a federal statute like section 29(c)(1) might be judicially expanded to protect the validity of the favored lien not just against the provisions of \"this chapter\" but against invalidation on any basis;  literal language does not always prevail.  Cf. Church of Holy Trinity v. United States, 143 U.S. 457, 12 S.Ct. 511, 36 L.Ed. 226 (1892).  But it would require a remarkable showing to persuade a court to read out of the statute the explicit limiting phrase (\"in this chapter\").  No such argument has even been attempted by Lehman Brothers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a similar reason, we think that the district court read too broadly the subsection (2) of the same section 29(c), quoted above, which says that the Securities Exchange Act shall not be read to give a defense to enforcement of a lien where the lien holder acquired it \"in good faith for value and without actual knowledge\" of any violation of that statute.  The district court took this provision to mean--apparently without support from the SEC--that \"federal law governs Lehman's status as a bona fide purchaser in an action to enforce its lien.\"  989 F.Supp. at 343.   Yet read literally, section 29(c)(2) is concerned only with the possible use of the federal statute, not New York law, to invalidate a lien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, section 29(c)(2) does not by itself purport to invalidate any lien;  it merely provides a defense to lien invalidation under certain circumstances.  The possible reach of the defense is beside the point unless and until someone makes out a claim of invalidity, and the only effort to do so here--the SEC's claim of invalidity under New York law--has thus far fallen short.  We leave for another day the interesting question whether the defense could ever operate where the attack on a lien was premised primarily upon state law and where state law invalidated a lien even of a good faith purchaser for value without actual knowledge of the securities-law violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, our reasoning would lead us to vacate the preliminary injunction at once.  However, the put options have been reduced to a sum of money being held by Lehman Brothers in escrow, and there is no obvious harm to Lehman Brothers in maintaining the escrow in the short run.  Possibly (the issue has not been argued) the SEC's ability to obtain \"disgorgement\" of these proceeds depends on the separate maintenance of this concrete stake, since there is no claim that Lehman Brothers itself violated the securities laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court can ascertain whether or not the SEC desires to pursue its disgorgement claim in light of our reading of New York law.  If so, the district court can also decide whether the preliminary injunction is needed to avoid mooting the case;  if there is such a need, and some prospect of success, the district court may choose to maintain the preliminary injunction, pending a prompt trial.

Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 844-45 (D.C.Cir.1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To simplify slightly, Pinez sold 2,700 call options allowing others to buy from him Centennial stock at about $20 per share, close to the market price at the time, and Pinez used the receipts from that sale to buy an equal number of put options allowing him to sell the stock to others at the same or a closely related price during the same period.

The assets were held in Pinez's brokerage account with Lehman Brothers, Inc., which claimed an overriding security interest in the assets.  Having failed to persuade the district court on this point, Lehman Brothers now appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The background facts are essentially undisputed.  Pinez, who was chairman of Centennial Technology, Inc., opened a personal brokerage account with Lehman Brothers in February 1996.  Frederick E. Pierce II became Pinez's account representative at Lehman Brothers.  In September 1996, Pinez executed a margin account agreement with Lehman Brothers (explicitly to be governed by New York law);  the agreement permitted him to borrow from Lehman Brothers to cover a portion of the cost of his purchases.  The agreement also gave Lehman Brothers a security interest as collateral for any margin debt in all assets held in the account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During 1996, Centennial stock performed remarkably well, reaching a high of $58 per share in December 1996.  According to the SEC, the reason was fraudulent bookkeeping by Pinez, including fictitious sales and inventory figures.  Indeed, after the events to be recounted, the company revised its financial statements to show a $28 million loss for the three-and-a-half years ending in December 1996, rather than the $12 million profit originally reported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Well before this public restatement, reports began to appear in newspapers in January and February 1997, suggesting doubts about Centennial's earnings and management.  Throughout January 1997, the price of Centennial stock fell, reaching $23.75 on January 31, 1997.  On February 5, 1997, Centennial's board of directors set up a special committee to investigate the company's earnings, and the vice chairman of the board told Pinez the next day that Pinez would likely have to leave if the company had to restate its earnings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 7, 1997, Pinez called Pierce and directed him to arrange a \"zero-cost collar\" on Centennial stock owned by Pinez;  Pinez then had almost $10 million in Centennial stock (at thencurrent market prices) in his Lehman Brothers account.  Pinez's apparent purpose was to ensure that he would have the necessary funds to cover his $5 million margin-account debt with Lehman Brothers even if the market price of his Centennial-stock collateral fell sharply and led Lehman Brothers to demand immediate payment of the debt, as it was entitled to do under the margin account agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A zero-cost collar involves two contemporaneous transactions:  the sale (here, by Pinez) of call options, giving the option buyers the right to purchase from the seller up to a certain amount of the stock at a fixed price, and the purchase (again by Pinez) of an equal number of put options, giving the buyer the right to sell a similar amount of stock to the sellers of the puts at some future period at a similar or closely related fixed price.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  What matters here is that the put options that Pinez acquired became assets held in his Lehman Brothers margin account.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Pinez called Pierce on February 7, 1997, Pierce asked whether Pinez was in a \"quiet period,\" during which he would be precluded from trading in Centennial securities;  Pinez said that he was not.  Pierce then obtained the necessary approvals from Lehman Brothers.  Pierce filled the order the same afternoon, selling 2700 Centennial \"call\" options and purchasing 2700 Centennial \"put\" options.  At this time, Pinez's account at Lehman Brothers held securities (mostly Centennial stock) providing barely adequate collateral for Pinez's total margin debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever Lehman Brothers should or might have suspected on February 7, 1997, there is no claim by the SEC that Lehman Brothers knew at that time either that Pinez had falsified Centennial's financial statements or that this possibility was under investigation by Centennial's board.  However, on February 11, 1997, Centennial announced publicly that it was undertaking an inquiry into its earlier financial statements, that it had removed Pinez from its management, and that the New York Stock Exchange had suspended trading in Centennial stock.  Lehman Brothers issued an immediate margin call demanding that Pinez pay it all outstanding margin debt, then more than $6 million.  Pinez failed to do so.  Lehman Brothers now had a contractual claim against Pinez for his margin debt, a claim Lehman Brothers much later reduced to a state-court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, one of the valuable assets in the Pinez account was the 2700 put contracts giving Pinez as put owner the right to make the unfortunate put sellers pay $20 per share for Centennial stock now worth much less.  Before Lehman Brothers could take advantage of this opportunity to dispose of its security, the SEC on February 14, 1997, brought the present civil action in the district court and obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order \"freezing\" all assets in Pinez accounts with various financial institutions, including Lehman Brothers.  The government also began criminal proceedings against Pinez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SEC's civil action, out of which the present appeal grows, charged Pinez with having secured the put options through the unlawful use of inside information--specifically, knowledge that Centennial's financial health was much worse than publicly known--in violation of various securities law requirements, primarily section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b).  Lehman Brothers was later named in an amended complaint as a \"relief defendant.\"   One object of the complaint was to require \"disgorgement\" by Pinez of his \"ill-gotten gains,\" including the put options that are the subject of this case.  By agreement of the parties, the put options were liquidated before they expired, so the controversy is now about the proceeds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the grant of the temporary restraining order, the district court held a hearing on March 6, 1997, on the SEC's request to transform the now expired TRO into a preliminary injunction.  Despite the expiration of the TRO, Lehman Brothers, as a courtesy to the court, agreed to maintain the proceeds derived from the put options in an escrow account while the court considered the SEC's motion.  Those proceeds now represent almost $5 million, which Lehman Brothers says is barely enough to cover the still unpaid portion of Pinez's margin-account debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, 1997, the district court released a memorandum and order granting the instant preliminary injunction insofar as it maintained a freeze on Pinez's assets, including the put option proceeds held in escrow by Lehman Brothers.  SEC v. Pinez, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></span> (D.Mass.1997).  After detailed analysis of federal and state law, the court concluded that at trial the SEC was likely to establish not only that Pinez had committed fraud in acquiring the put options, but also that \"Lehman [Brothers] is not a bona fide purchaser of those securities....\"  Id. at 345.   This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this court, Lehman Brothers has assumed that but for its asserted security interest in the margin account assets, the SEC would have a valid claim to recoup the proceeds as the product of an unlawful transaction by Pinez (the put options purchases).  Conversely, the SEC has assumed that its claim to the proceeds is subordinated if Lehman Brothers is treated as a bona fide purchaser of the put options for value;  the SEC does not dispute that Lehman Brothers should be treated as a purchaser for value, and the relevant law supports this concession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the dispute--as framed by the parties--is whether Lehman Brothers is a bona fide purchaser.  We accept the assumptions of the parties but do not independently endorse them.  Cf. In re Newport Plaza Assoc. v. Durfee Attleboro Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600262\"><a href=\"/opinion/600262/in-re-newport-plaza-associates-lp-debtor-newport-plaza-associates/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 643-44 (1st Cir.1993).  As to the law governing Lehman Brothers' status as a bona fide purchaser, the SEC regards the issue as governed by New York law, while Lehman Brothers invokes federal securities law.  We address the legal issues in that order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New York law is a sound starting point because in this instance, as in most commercial transactions, state law provides the matrix of background rules and is ordinarily displaced, if at all, only by conflicting, field-occupying provisions of federal statutory law, or occasionally by federal common law.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span> (1966).  Here, the margin account agreement relied on by Lehman Brothers for its priority is expressly governed by New York law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that save as federal law may dictate otherwise, Lehman Brothers' rights to the proceeds vis-a-vis the SEC are controlled by article 8 of New York's Uniform Commercial Code, N.Y.U.C.C. &#167; 8-301 et seq.  (McKinney 1987).  Article 8 governs investment securities, and section 8-302 defines a \"bona fide purchaser\" as \"a purchaser for value in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim\" who obtains a security (under certain specified conditions which the SEC here assumes to have been satisfied).  Section 8-302(3) then provides:  \"A bona fide purchaser in addition to acquiring the rights of a purchaser (Section 8-301) also acquires his interest in the security free of any adverse claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Adverse claim\" is defined in fairly general terms (in section 8-302(2)) but we need not pursue the subject because the SEC appears to assume that its own claim for \"disgorgement\" of the put options (or their proceeds) constitutes an adverse claim that would not prevail against a bona fide purchaser.  Instead, it says that it is entitled to prevail over Lehman Brothers because Lehman Brothers, even though a \"purchaser for value,\" was not one \"in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim.\"  N.Y.U.C.C. &#167; 8-302.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The factual predicate for the SEC's position is that Pinez was known to be an insider, he was engaging in a transaction that made a good deal of sense if one expected a dip in the price of his stock, and there was some public information suggesting that the company might be in more difficulty than its past financial reports would indicate.  These facts are undisputed and we will assume, in unison with the SEC, that they amply amount to suspicious circumstances that should have alerted Lehman Brothers to the possibility of trouble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The key to the SEC's legal argument is that Lehman Brothers' disregard of \"suspicious circumstances\" deprives it of bona fide purchaser status (Lehman Brothers did make a brief inquiry of Pinez as already recounted, but no more).  In the words of the district court, which took a similar view of New York law, \"a failure to act on actual knowledge of suspicious circumstances constitutes bad faith on the part of a lienholder\" and thereby defeats a claim of bona fide purchaser status.  Pinez, 989 F.Supp. at 344.   Lehman Brothers, by contrast, asserts in its brief that under New York's UCC, \"good faith\" is \"entirely 'subjective,' and that it excludes any duty of inquiry.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We adopt neither position outright, but think that the law is closer to Lehman Brothers' view.  In our view, the emphasis in the New York case law is on subjective bad faith and dishonesty,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> an emphasis echoed in parallel provisions of section 3-304 which--in relation to commercial paper--describe notice of a claim or defense as including \"knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounts to bad faith.\"  N.Y.U.C.C. &#167; 3-304(7) (McKinney 1987).  Although the case law provides the decisive gloss, plain language confirms it:  in ordinary parlance, one can certainly be \"suspicious\" without being dishonest in deciding to proceed with a transaction where suspicions are outweighed by competing considerations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">New York has deliberately adopted a standard somewhat more favorable to the recipient of the securities than have a number of other states.  As New York's highest court has noted, New York and Virginia are the only states to insist that notice \"be determined by a subjective test of actual knowledge.\"  Hartford, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></span>, 542 N.E.2d at 1094;  see also Chemical Bank, 411 N.E.2d at 1341;  cf.  Lawton v. Walker, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1269476\"><a href=\"/opinion/1269476/lawton-v-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">335</span></a></span>, 337-38 (Va.1986) (construing the parallel provision of the Virginia UCC &#167; 8.3-304).  Where one draws the line in requiring more or less inquiry by the purchaser is a policy choice;  the New York legislature could plausibly choose to facilitate stock transactions by limiting the obligation to inquire and giving bona fide purchaser status a generous reach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The SEC points to cases that forbid someone from deliberately averting his eyes from evident misconduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  We agree that such conduct, even if literally short of actual knowledge, could fairly be equated with dishonesty or bad faith.  But there is nothing in the facts before us to suggest that Pinez's use of a \"collar\" transaction could only be explained by the use of inside information.  Nor has the SEC shown that Lehman Brothers deliberately closed its eyes to some easily obtained information that would have confirmed that Pinez was engaging in securities fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, we can imagine in extreme circumstances imputing bad faith to a purchaser who had very strong suspicions of grave misconduct, who could readily have verified or dispelled the suspicion, and who failed to do so without any plausible excuse.  To this limited extent, there may be a duty of inquiry where a failure to inquire amounts to bad faith.  But here, misconduct was merely a possibility;  Lehman Brothers had been directed to execute an immediate transaction, and the SEC does not suggest how it could have swiftly and definitely assured itself that no insider information had been used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking New York law to require dishonesty and not mere suspicion, and applying that standard to the facts currently of record, we do not think that the SEC has shown a reasonable likelihood of prevailing against Lehman Brothers on the merits.  This disagreement with the able district judge rests primarily on our reading of New York law, which we assess de novo.   Of course, the present record does not reflect an evidentiary hearing, let alone a full trial;  whether eventually the SEC might adduce more facts that would meet the dishonesty standard is another matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the question whether federal law supersedes state law, either in favor of Lehman Brothers or in favor of the SEC. Lehman Brothers relies on two provisions of the federal securities law, which it reads as saying that only \"actual knowledge\" of Pinez's violation would impair its security interest.  Conversely, the district judge, but not the SEC, thinks that a third provision of the federal securities laws makes suspicious circumstances enough.  We think that none of the three provisions cited alters the result in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lehman Brothers first relies upon section 29(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78cc(b).  In pertinent part, section 29(b) provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every contract made in violation of any provision of this chapter ... shall be void (1) as regards to the rights of any person who, in violation of any such provision ... shall have made or engaged in the performance of any such contract, and (2) as regards to the rights of any person who, not being a party to such contract, shall have acquired any right thereunder with actual knowledge of the facts by reason of which the making or performance of such contract was in violation of any such provision....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on subsection (2), Lehman Brothers argues that the \"actual knowledge\" requirement controls, with no ifs or buts based on suspicious circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume without deciding that Lehman Brothers is right in its reading of the phrase \"actual knowledge.\"   We will also assume that Lehman Brothers is a person who, \"not being a party\" to such put option contracts, acquired a right thereunder, namely, the right as successor to Pinez to enforce the put options contracts.  It therefore would follow from these (untested) assumptions that Lehman Brothers could defeat any claim under section 29(b) by the put options sellers that, because of Pinez's violation, the contracts were \"void.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But subsections (1) and (2) are merely limitations on the consequences that would otherwise be visited by the principal directive of section 29(b), namely, that the options contracts would be voidable under federal law.  No one, including the SEC, says that Lehman Brothers cannot enforce the options contracts, as it has already done in liquidating them.  Instead, the SEC is challenging Lehman Brothers' security interest in the proceeds created by the margin agreement and is arguing that that security interest, created by New York law, is also undermined by New York law because of Lehman Brothers' alleged bad faith.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there were conflict between section 29(b) and New York law, the latter would give way under the Supremacy Clause.  There is no such conflict.  Section 29(b) is a federal law that makes the put option contracts unenforceable by the buyer against the seller where acquired through the buyer's violation of \"this chapter\" (presumably, Lehman Brothers was rescued by subsection (b)(2)).  The New York UCC provision relied on by the SEC does not contradict this outcome;  it merely gives the SEC an independent ground under New York law for saying that Lehman Brothers has no valid security interest, a security interest that Lehman Brothers itself assumes it needs in order to prevail over the SEC.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lehman Brothers' other resort is to section 29(c)(1), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78cc(c), which in pertinent part provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed (1) to affect the validity .... of any lien ... unless at the time of ... the creating of such lien, the person ... acquiring such lien shall have actual knowledge of facts by reason of which ... the acquisition of such lien is a violation of the provisions of this chapter .... or (2) to afford a defense to ... the enforcement of any lien by any person who shall have acquired such ... lien in good faith for value and without actual knowledge of the violation of any provision of this chapter....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The literal language of subsection (1) is no help to Lehman Brothers since it merely protects the lien (i.e., the security interest) against any provision of the Securities Exchange Act that might otherwise be taken to invalidate it.  Here, the SEC is relying upon provisions of the New York UCC--not \"this chapter\"--so the quoted language of section 29(c) does not by its terms apply.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, in unusual circumstances a federal statute like section 29(c)(1) might be judicially expanded to protect the validity of the favored lien not just against the provisions of \"this chapter\" but against invalidation on any basis;  literal language does not always prevail.  Cf. Church of Holy Trinity v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93280\"><a href=\"/opinion/93280/church-of-holy-trinity-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93280\"><a href=\"/opinion/93280/church-of-holy-trinity-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"93280\"><a href=\"/opinion/93280/church-of-holy-trinity-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span> (1892).  But it would require a remarkable showing to persuade a court to read out of the statute the explicit limiting phrase (\"in this chapter\").  No such argument has even been attempted by Lehman Brothers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For a similar reason, we think that the district court read too broadly the subsection (2) of the same section 29(c), quoted above, which says that the Securities Exchange Act shall not be read to give a defense to enforcement of a lien where the lien holder acquired it \"in good faith for value and without actual knowledge\" of any violation of that statute.  The district court took this provision to mean--apparently without support from the SEC--that \"federal law governs Lehman's status as a bona fide purchaser in an action to enforce its lien.\"  989 F.Supp. at 343.   Yet read literally, section 29(c)(2) is concerned only with the possible use of the federal statute, not New York law, to invalidate a lien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, section 29(c)(2) does not by itself purport to invalidate any lien;  it merely provides a defense to lien invalidation under certain circumstances.  The possible reach of the defense is beside the point unless and until someone makes out a claim of invalidity, and the only effort to do so here--the SEC's claim of invalidity under New York law--has thus far fallen short.  We leave for another day the interesting question whether the defense could ever operate where the attack on a lien was premised primarily upon state law and where state law invalidated a lien even of a good faith purchaser for value without actual knowledge of the securities-law violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, our reasoning would lead us to vacate the preliminary injunction at once.  However, the put options have been reduced to a sum of money being held by Lehman Brothers in escrow, and there is no obvious harm to Lehman Brothers in maintaining the escrow in the short run.  Possibly (the issue has not been argued) the SEC's ability to obtain \"disgorgement\" of these proceeds depends on the separate maintenance of this concrete stake, since there is no claim that Lehman Brothers itself violated the securities laws.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court can ascertain whether or not the SEC desires to pursue its disgorgement claim in light of our reading of New York law.  If so, the district court can also decide whether the preliminary injunction is needed to avoid mooting the case;  if there is such a need, and some prospect of success, the district court may choose to maintain the preliminary injunction, pending a prompt trial.
