Daniel R. Domnguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Nydia Maria Diaz-Buxo on brief for appellant.\r\n   David W. Ogden, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Guillermo\r\nGil, United States Attorney, Robert S. Greenspan and Steve Frank,\r\nAttorneys, Appellate Staff, Department of Justice, on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nAugust 5, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.    The  plaintiff, Mercedes Oquendo-\r\nAyala, appeals a district court order that summarily dismissed\r\nher complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction.  Having thoroughly reviewed the\r\nrecord and the parties' briefs on appeal, we conclude that the\r\norder of dismissal is correct.  Plaintiff's tort claims against\r\nthe Drug Enforcement Administration are time barred as a result\r\nof her failure to timely present her administrative claim to\r\nthat agency, as required under the Federal Tort Claims Act. \r\nSee 28 U.S.C.  2401(b).  See also Santiago-Ramirez v.\r\nSecretary of Department of Defense, 984 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir.\r\n1993); Kokaras v. United States, 980 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir.\r\n1992); Corte-Real v. United States, 949 F.2d 484, 485-86 (1st\r\nCir. 1991); Eveland v. Director of the CIA, 843 F.2d 46, 50 (1st\r\nCir. 1988); Hau v. United States, 575 F.2d 1000, 1002-03 (1st\r\nCir. 1978).\r\n          Although plaintiff did timely file a claim with the\r\nUnited States Attorney's office, that office was not the\r\nappropriate agency for purposes of the Federal Tort Claims Act,\r\nand it complied with the requirements of 28 C.F.R.  14.2(b)(1)\r\nwhen it transferred the claim to the Federal Bureau of\r\nInvestigation, which plaintiff identified on her claim as the\r\n\"appropriate agency.\"  Thus, filing with the United States\r\nAttorney's office does not constitute \"constructive filing\"\r\nwith the Drug Enforcement Administration.  See Hart v.\r\nDepartment of Labor ex rel. United States, 116 F.3d 1338, 1341\r\n(10th Cir. 1997); Lotrionte v. United States, 560 F. Supp. 41,\r\n43 (S.D.N.Y. 1983), aff'd, 742 F.2d 1436 (2d Cir. 1983)\r\n(TABLE).  Cf. Bukala v. United States, 854 F.2d 201, 203 (7th\r\nCir. 1988); Greene v. United States, 872 F.2d 236, 237 (8th Cir.\r\n1989).\r\n          Plaintiff's  1983 claim against the United States\r\nfails because  1983 does not apply to federal officials acting\r\npursuant to federal law.  See Chatman v. Hernandez, 805 F.2d\r\n453, 455 (1st Cir. 1986); Cervoni v. Secretary of Health\r\nEducation &amp; Welfare, 581 F.2d 1010, 1019 (1st Cir. 1978).  \r\n          Affirmed.
