We  have  carefully reviewed  the\r                                 \r\r\n\nrecord and conclude  that substantial  evidence supports  the\r\n\nSecretary's  determination that claimant  was not entitled to\r\n\nsocial security disability benefits.   We have considered all\r\n\nof  claimant's  arguments and,  finding  them without  merit,\r\n\naffirm the judgment essentially for the reasons stated by the\r\n\ndistrict court.  We add only these comments. \r\n\n          Claimant now argues, as  he did before the district\r\n\ncourt, that the record does  not support the conclusion  that\r\n\nhis skin condition does not limit his ability  to do his past\r\n\nrelevant work because he can use gloves.  On the contrary, it\r\n\nwas  within  the province  of  the  Secretary  to reach  that\r\n\ncommon-sense  conclusion, considering  not  only the  medical\r\n\nfindings  stated  in  the dermatologist's  letter,  but  also\r\n\nclaimant's own testimony about the intermittent nature of the\r\n\ncondition,  its  alleviation   through  treatment,  his  past\r\n\npractice of sometimes wearing gloves while  doing maintenance\r\n\nwork,  his  past  ability  to function  many  years  with the\r\n\ncondition (he  said  he had  it  since he  was  12), and  his\r\n\nfailure  to list the skin  condition in his  application as a\r\n\nreason  why  he cannot  work.
