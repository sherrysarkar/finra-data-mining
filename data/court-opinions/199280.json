Perry, Senior Litigation Counsel, Office of\nImmigration Litigation, were on brief, for respondent.\n\f                         February 21, 2001\n\n\n           BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.        This case is an attack\n\non a deportation order holding the petitioner removable as\n\ncharged.   The issue is whether the immigration judge (IJ) and\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) properly found that the\n\npetitioner was \"convicted\" and therefore subject to deportation\n\nwhen he was seventeen years of age at the time he committed the\n\ncriminal offense.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           We state the facts as recited in the administrative\n\nrecord.     Petitioner   Antonio    Vieira    Garcia   is   a   permanent\n\nresident of the United States.          Originally from Cape Verde, he\n\nentered this country with his family on December 22, 1987, when\n\nhe was nine years old.    In March 1996, the petitioner committed\n\na criminal offense, 1 and the State of Rhode Island filed a\n\n\n    1     We are not entirely sure what the offense was because\nthat charge is not part of the current proceeding.       In his\nbrief, the petitioner says that he committed an assault with a\ndeadly weapon. The administrative record contains no copies of\nthe criminal records from the petitioner's first offense. The\npetitioner now, for the first time, attempts to supplement the\nrecord by submitting an appendix with copies of those court\nrecords. The respondent has moved to strike the records from\nthe appendix on the grounds that they are not properly before\nthis court because they pertain to matters outside the\nadministrative record.    We agree and grant the respondent's\nmotion to strike. See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(A) (“the court of\n\n                                   -2-\n\fdelinquency petition in Rhode Island Family Court.   The petition\n\nwas dismissed, however, and the petitioner was charged as an\n\nadult.2   As we understand it, the case against the petitioner was\n\neventually dropped.\n\n            On August 26, 1996, the petitioner attempted to steal\n\nplatinum tire rims from an automobile in violation of R.I. Gen.\n\nLaws §§ 11-41-6, 11-41-5, and 11-41-1.       At the time of this\n\noffense, the petitioner was four days shy of his eighteenth\n\nbirthday.     Because he had been waived out of juvenile court\n\nafter the first offense, he was charged as an adult for the\n\nsecond offense.    See R.I. Gen. Laws § 14-1-7.1(c) (“waiver of\n\njurisdiction over a child . . . shall constitute a waiver of\n\njurisdiction over that child for the offense upon which the\n\nmotion is based as well as for all pending and subsequent\n\noffenses of whatever nature . . . .”).\n\n            The petitioner pled guilty to the charges and was\n\nsentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years, with two years\n\nto serve, eight years suspended, and eight years probation.   The\n\n\n\nappeals shall decide the petition [for review] only on the\nadministrative record on which the order of removal is based.”).\n     2    It is not entirely clear whether the defendant\nvoluntarily waived himself out of the delinquency proceedings.\nThat fact is irrelevant, however; the fact remains that he was\nwaived out of delinquency proceedings and was charged as an\nadult.\n\n                                -3-\n\fImmigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) brought removal\n\nproceedings against the petitioner on the ground that he was\n\nsubject    to     removal    from       the    United   States      pursuant     to\n\nsection 237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\n\n(“INA”), as amended, because he was convicted, after admission\n\nto the United States, of an aggravated felony as described in\n\nINA § 101(a)(43)(G) (\"a theft offense . . . for which the term\n\nof imprisonment [is] at least one year\").\n\n           In     his   removal        proceedings      before     the    IJ,   the\n\npetitioner argued that the IJ should apply federal law for\n\npurposes    of    determining         deportability.       Under    the    Federal\n\nJuvenile Delinquency Act (“FJDA”), 18 U.S.C. § 5031, a juvenile\n\nis defined as one who has not attained his eighteenth birthday.\n\nThe petitioner argued that because he was only seventeen, “the\n\noffense was a delinquency and not a conviction for immigration\n\npurposes.”       The IJ disagreed and rejected the petitioner's plea\n\nto apply federal law.            The IJ noted that the proceedings took\n\nplace within the United States, as opposed to a foreign nation,\n\nand that the petitioner had been treated as an adult in Rhode\n\nIsland    courts,    not    as    a   juvenile.      The   IJ    held    that   the\n\npetitioner had been “convicted” of an aggravated felony after\n\nadmission and was deportable as charged.                   The IJ ordered him\n\nremoved to Cape Verde.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f            The petitioner appealed the IJ's order to the BIA,\n\nrepeating    his     argument         that     because     he    was    in   federal\n\nimmigration proceedings, whether or not he has a “conviction”\n\nfor immigration purposes should be determined by federal law,\n\nnot Rhode Island state law.                He argued that applying the FJDA,\n\nas opposed to state law, would avoid disparate treatment for the\n\nsame offense depending solely on where the offense had occurred.\n\n\n\n            The    BIA,    in    a   per     curiam   decision,    dismissed     the\n\npetitioner's appeal.            The BIA applied the new definition of\n\n“conviction”      found    at    §    101(a)(48)      of   the   INA,    which   was\n\nintroduced    as    part    of       the   Illegal    Immigration       Reform   and\n\nImmigrant Rehabilitation Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\").                        See IIRIRA,\n\nPub. L. No. 104-208, § 322, 110 Stat. 3009.\n\n            The BIA stated that “[i]n passing this legislation [the\n\nIIRIRA], Congress could have, but did not, exclude juvenile\n\noffenses . . . .”          The BIA also commented on the legislative\n\nhistory of the IIRIRA, noting that the definition of conviction\n\nwas deliberately broadened beyond that of the prior definition.\n\n            The BIA ultimately determined that Congress's intent\n\nto expand the definition of conviction is clear and there is “no\n\nneed to adopt a federal standard for adjudicating removal cases\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\ffor those aliens who have received convictions prior to their\n\n18th birthday.”       It dismissed the appeal.\n\n           On appeal to this court, the petitioner reiterates the\n\nsame arguments that were presented to both the IJ and the BIA.\n\nHe   further   contends   that   the    BIA   failed   to   articulate   any\n\nreasoned explanation for treating him differently from other\n\nclasses of juveniles and thus denied him his constitutional\n\nright to equal protection.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           We bifurcate our analysis: First, we address the BIA's\n\nconstruction     of     the   statute     defining     \"conviction\"      for\n\nimmigration purposes as it relates to the particular facts in\n\nthis case.      Then we address the petitioner's constitutional\n\nclaim that the BIA violated his right to equal protection.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fA.     Was the petitioner \"convicted\"?\n\n            \"We     review      de    novo    an    agency's    construction    of    a\n\nstatute that it administers, subject, however, to established\n\nprinciples of deference.\"              Herrera-Inirio v. INS, 208 F.3d 299,\n\n304 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S.\n\n415, 424-25 (1999)).            \"If the intent of Congress is clear, that\n\nis the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency,\n\nmust    give   effect      to   the     unambiguously        expressed     intent    of\n\nCongress.\"     Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council,\n\nInc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).                   \"[I]f the statute is silent\n\nor ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question\n\nfor the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a\n\npermissible construction of the statute.\"                    Id. at 843.    \"Because\n\nagency officials acting in the immigration context exercise\n\nespecially      sensitive            political      functions     that     implicate\n\nquestions of foreign relations, deference to administrative\n\nexpertise is particularly appropriate.\"                        Herrera-Inirio, 208\n\nF.3d at 304 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n            The     path   that       leads    to    the   current    definition     of\n\n\"conviction\" is a long and winding one.                      In 1988, the BIA, in\n\nMatter of Ozkok, 19 I. & N. Dec. 546, 551-52 (BIA 1988),\n\nattempted      to   ensure       uniformity         by     creating   a   three-part\n\n\n\n\n                                             -7-\n\fdefinition of \"conviction.\"3      That effort to produce uniformity\n\nfailed and, in 1996, Congress enacted the IIRIRA, which, among\n\nother things, added the current definition of conviction to the\n\nINA.       See INA § 101(a)(48)(A); 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(48)(A).   The\n\ncurrent definition of \"conviction\" as it relates to immigration\n\nis as follows:\n\n              The term \"conviction\" means, with respect to\n              an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the\n              alien entered by a court or, if adjudication\n              of guilt has been withheld, where--\n\n                     (i) a judge or jury has found the\n              alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea\n              of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted\n              sufficient facts to warrant a finding of\n              guilt, and\n\n\n\n\n       3  In Matter of Ozkok, the BIA held that a \"conviction\"\nfor immigration purposes consisted of the following elements:\n\n            (1) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or\n       he has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or\n       has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of\n       guilty;\n\n            (2) the judge has ordered some form of punishment,\n       penalty, or restraint on the person's liberty to be\n       imposed . . . ; and\n\n            (3) a judgment or adjudication of guilt may be\n       entered if the person violates the terms of his\n       probation or fails to comply with the requirements of\n       the court's order, without availability of further\n       proceedings regarding the person's guilt or innocence\n       of the original charge.\n\nId.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f                   (ii) the judge has ordered some form\n            of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the\n            alien's liberty to be imposed.\n\nINA § 101(a)(48)(A).\n\n            In Herrera-Inirio, we held that it was Congress's\n\nintent to \"broaden[] the scope of the definition of 'conviction'\n\nbeyond that adopted by the Board of Immigration Appeals in\n\nMatter of Ozkok.\"    208 F.3d at 305 (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No.\n\n104-828, at 244 (1996)).    We stated that \"[t]his language leaves\n\nnothing to the imagination.\"     Id. at 304.\n\n            We follow that holding in the present case.        The\n\nstatute is clear and unambiguous.     Applying the statute, we hold\n\nthat the petitioner does have a \"conviction.\"         He does not\n\ncontest that he pled guilty to the charges levied against him or\n\nthat the judge ordered punishment in the form of imprisonment.\n\nWhat he does contest is the fact that he was a juvenile at the\n\ntime of the offense and therefore should not be found to have a\n\n\"conviction.\"\n\n            He argues that we should apply the FJDA to his case and\n\nconclude that he does not have a \"conviction\" for immigration\n\npurposes.    Such a determination would allow him to remain in\n\nthis country.     The petitioner argues that because he was only\n\nseventeen, “the offense was a delinquency and not a conviction\n\nfor immigration purposes.”      We disagree.    The petitioner was\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fadjudicated as an adult in the Rhode Island state court.                    The\n\nBIA held:\n\n            By the time an alien has been served a\n            Notice to Appear and appears within the\n            jurisdiction of the Executive Office for\n            Immigration Review, he or she has already\n            been adjudicated as an adult or a juvenile\n            within the jurisdiction of the criminal\n            court; the Immigration Court need not enter\n            into this consideration and is free to apply\n            section 101(a)(48) of the Act. Whether or\n            not a state court adjudicates an alien's\n            criminal behavior in juvenile proceedings\n            falls outside of our jurisdiction . . . .\n\n            We agree.   Neither we nor the BIA have jurisdiction to\n\ndetermine how a state court should adjudicate its defendants.\n\nOnce adjudicated by the state court, as either a juvenile or an\n\nadult, we are bound by that determination.\n\n            It is true that if a juvenile is prosecuted under\n\nforeign laws, the BIA will apply the FJDA to determine whether\n\nhe had a juvenile delinquency or an adult \"conviction\" for\n\nimmigration purposes.      See, e.g., Matter of De La Nues, 18 I. &\n\nN. Dec. 140 (BIA 1981); Matter of Ramirez-Rivero, 18 I. & N.\n\nDec. 135 (BIA 1981).       The petitioner urges us to expand that\n\nruling to cover juveniles prosecuted under state laws, and\n\ninvites us to adopt a federal standard for determining if a\n\npetitioner    who   commits   an    offense    prior      to   his   eighteenth\n\nbirthday has a \"conviction\" for immigration purposes.                 The plain\n\nlanguage    of   the   statute     forbids    us   from    adopting     such   a\n\n                                    -10-\n\fstandard.      If Congress had wanted the INS to follow the FJDA at\n\nall   times,    it     would   have    so   stated.   We   hold    that   this\n\npetitioner has a \"conviction\" as defined by INA § 101(a)(48).\n\nB.     Does     this    violate       the   petitioner's   right   to     equal\n\nprotection?\n\n            The petitioner next argues that failure to apply the\n\nFJDA violates his right to equal protection.                He claims that\n\nsimilarly situated persons--persons of the same age, who commit\n\nthe same offense--will be treated differently depending on where\n\nthey commit the offense.          This is quite a stretch for the equal\n\nprotection doctrine.\n\n            There can be no doubt that aliens are entitled to equal\n\nprotection of the law.          Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 641\n\n(1973); Herrera-Inirio, 208 F.3d at 306; Almon v. Reno, 192 F.3d\n\n28, 31 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 83 (2000).                 We\n\napply a rational-basis review to this equal protection analysis.\n\nSee Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319 (1993); Almon, 192 F.3d at\n\n31.   This is a \"minimal standard of review,\" and the distinction\n\n\"must be upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate\n\ngovernmental purpose.\"          Almon, 192 F.3d at 31.        We also note\n\nthat \"the government need not actually articulate at any time\n\nthe purpose or rationale supporting its classification.\"                  Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f            Under this minimal standard of review, we hold that\n\nthere is no violation of equal protection and it is entirely\n\nrational for the BIA to rely on the law of the convicting state\n\nto determine whether a juvenile has been convicted as an adult.\n\nWe have held that the definition of a \"conviction\" as defined in\n\n§ 101(a)(48) \"applies even if both the predicate offense and the\n\npenalty therefor are creatures of state law.\"             Herrera-Inirio,\n\n208 F.3d at 306.          Under the facts and circumstances of this\n\ncase, it is beyond our jurisdiction to determine whether a state\n\ncourt     adjudicates     its   criminal     defendants   as    adults   or\n\njuveniles.        Once the determination is made, we are thereby\n\nbound.\n\n            The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution\n\nprovides:\n\n            Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each\n            State to the public Acts, Records, and\n            judicial Proceedings of every other State.\n            And the Congress may by general Laws\n            prescribe the Manner in which such Acts,\n            Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and\n            the Effect thereof.\n\nU.S.     Const.    art.   IV,   §   1.      Congress   passed   a   statute\n\nimplementing the Full Faith and Credit Clause, see 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1738, which states, inter alia, that\n\n            [s]uch    Acts,   records   and   judicial\n            proceedings . . . shall have the same full\n            faith and credit in every court within the\n            United States and its Territories and\n\n                                     -12-\n\f            Possessions as they have by law or usage in\n            the courts of such State, Territory or\n            Possession from which they are taken.\n\nId.\n\n            The petitioner argues that the BIA must apply the FJDA\n\nrather than the laws of the convicting state to avoid disparate\n\ntreatment of juveniles based on where they are prosecuted.                              We\n\ndisagree.

The issue is whether the immigration judge (IJ) and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) properly found that the petitioner was \"convicted\" and therefore subject to deportation when he was seventeen years of age at the time he committed the criminal offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We state the facts as recited in the administrative record. Petitioner Antonio Vieira Garcia is a permanent resident of the United States. Originally from Cape Verde, he entered this country with his family on December 22, 1987, when he was nine years old. In March 1996, the petitioner committed a criminal offense,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the State of Rhode Island filed a delinquency petition in Rhode Island Family Court. The petition was dismissed, however, and the petitioner was charged as an adult.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As we understand it, the case against the petitioner was eventually dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 26, 1996, the petitioner attempted to steal platinum tire rims from an automobile in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 11-41-6, 11-41-5, and 11-41-1. At the time of this offense, the petitioner was four days shy of his eighteenth birthday. Because he had been waived out of juvenile court after the first offense, he was charged as an adult for the second offense. See R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 14-1-7.1(c) (\"waiver of jurisdiction over a child . . . shall constitute a waiver of jurisdiction over that child for the offense upon which the motion is based as well as for all pending and subsequent offenses of whatever nature ....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner pled guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years, with two years to serve, eight years suspended, and eight years probation. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") brought removal proceedings against the petitioner on the ground that he was subject to removal from the United States pursuant to section237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), as amended, because he was convicted, after admission to the United States, of an aggravated felony as described in INA &#167;101(a)(43)(G) (\"a theft offense . . . for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his removal proceedings before the IJ, the petitioner argued that the IJ should apply federal law for purposes of determining deportability. Under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (\"FJDA\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5031, a juvenile is defined as one who has not attained his eighteenth birthday. The petitioner argued that because he was only seventeen, \"the offense was a delinquency and not a conviction for immigration purposes.\" The IJ disagreed and rejected the petitioner's plea to apply federal law. The IJ noted that the proceedings took place within the United States, as opposed to a foreign nation, and that the petitioner had been treated as an adult in Rhode Island courts, not as a juvenile. The IJ held that the petitioner had been \"convicted\" of an aggravated felony after admission and was deportable as charged. The IJ ordered him removed to Cape Verde.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed the IJ's order to the BIA, repeating his argument that because he was in federal immigration proceedings, whether or not he has a \"conviction\" for immigration purposes should be determined by federal law, not Rhode Island state law. He argued that applying the FJDA, as opposed to state law, would avoid disparate treatment for the same offense depending solely on where the offense had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA, in a per curiam decision, dismissed the petitioner's appeal. The BIA applied the new definition of \"conviction\" found at &#167; 101(a)(48) of the INA, which was introduced as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Rehabilitation Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"). See IIRIRA, Pub. L. No. 104-208, &#167; 322, 110 Stat. 3009.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA stated that \"[i]n passing this legislation [the IIRIRA], Congress could have, but did not, exclude juvenile offenses . . . .\" The BIA also commented on the legislative history of the IIRIRA, noting that the definition of conviction was deliberately broadened beyond that of the prior definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA ultimately determined that Congress's intent to expand the definition of conviction is clear and there is \"no need to adopt a federal standard for adjudicating removal cases for those aliens who have received convictions prior to their 18th birthday.\" It dismissed the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to this court, the petitioner reiterates the same arguments that were presented to both the IJ and the BIA. He further contends that the BIA failed to articulate any reasoned explanation for treating him differently from other classes of juveniles and thus denied him his constitutional right to equal protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bifurcate our analysis: First, we address the BIA's construction of the statute defining \"conviction\" for immigration purposes as it relates to the particular facts in this case. Then we address the petitioner's constitutional claim that the BIA violated his right to equal protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Was the petitioner \"convicted\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review de novo an agency's construction of a statute that it administers, subject, however, to established principles of deference.\" Herrera-Inirio v. INS, 208 F.3d 299, 304 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424-25 (1999)). \"If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\" Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984). \"[I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\" Id. at 843. \"Because agency officials acting in the immigration context exercise especially sensitive political functions that implicate questions of foreign relations, deference to administrative expertise is particularly appropriate.\" Herrera-Inirio, 208 F.3d at 304 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The path that leads to the current definition of \"conviction\" is a long and winding one. In 1988, the BIA, in Matter of Ozkok, 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 546, 551-52 (BIA 1988), attempted to ensure uniformity by creating a three-part definition of \"conviction.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That effort to produce uniformity failed and, in 1996, Congress enacted the IIRIRA, which, among other things, added the current definition of conviction to the INA. See INA &#167;101(a)(48)(A); 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(48)(A). The current definition of \"conviction\" as it relates to immigration is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"conviction\" means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien's liberty to be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INA &#167; 101(a)(48)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Herrera-Inirio, we held that it was Congress's intent to \"broaden[] the scope of the definition of 'conviction' beyond that adopted by the Board of Immigration Appeals in Matter of Ozkok.\" 208 F.3d at 305 (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-828, at 244 (1996)). We stated that \"[t]his language leaves nothing to the imagination.\" Id. at 304.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We follow that holding in the present case. The statute is clear and unambiguous. Applying the statute, we hold that the petitioner does have a \"conviction.\" He does not contest that he pled guilty to the charges levied against him or that the judge ordered punishment in the form of imprisonment. What he does contest is the fact that he was a juvenile at the time of the offense and therefore should not be found to have a \"conviction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He argues that we should apply the FJDA to his case and conclude that he does not have a \"conviction\" for immigration purposes. Such a determination would allow him to remain in this country. The petitioner argues that because he was only seventeen, \"the offense was a delinquency and not a conviction for immigration purposes.\" We disagree. The petitioner was adjudicated as an adult in the Rhode Island state court. The BIA held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time an alien has been served a Notice to Appear and appears within the jurisdiction of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, he or she has already been adjudicated as an adult or a juvenile within the jurisdiction of the criminal court; the Immigration Court need not enter into this consideration and is free to apply section 101(a)(48) of the Act. Whether or not a state court adjudicates an alien's criminal behavior in juvenile proceedings falls outside of our jurisdiction . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree. Neither we nor the BIA have jurisdiction to determine how a state court should adjudicate its defendants. Once adjudicated by the state court, as either a juvenile or an adult, we are bound by that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that if a juvenile is prosecuted under foreign laws, the BIA will apply the FJDA to determine whether he had a juvenile delinquency or an adult \"conviction\" for immigration purposes. See, e.g., Matter of De La Nues, 18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 140 (BIA 1981); Matter of Ramirez-Rivero, 18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 135 (BIA 1981). The petitioner urges us to expand that ruling to cover juveniles prosecuted under state laws, and invites us to adopt a federal standard for determining if a petitioner who commits an offense prior to his eighteenth birthday has a \"conviction\" for immigration purposes. The plain language of the statute forbids us from adopting such a standard. If Congress had wanted the INS to follow the FJDA at all times, it would have so stated. We hold that this petitioner has a \"conviction\" as defined by INA &#167;101(a)(48).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Does this violate the petitioner's right to equal protection?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner next argues that failure to apply the FJDA violates his right to equal protection. He claims that similarly situated persons--persons of the same age, who commit the same offense--will be treated differently depending on where they commit the offense. This is quite a stretch for the equal protection doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There can be no doubt that aliens are entitled to equal protection of the law. Sugarman v. Dougall, 413 U.S. 634, 641 (1973); Herrera-Inirio, 208 F.3d at 306; Almon v. Reno, 192 F.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 83 (2000). We apply a rational-basis review to this equal protection analysis. See Hellerv. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319 (1993); Almon, 192 F.3d at 31. This is a \"minimal standard of review,\" and the distinction \"must be upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.\" Almon, 192 F.3d at 31. We also note that \"the government need not actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this minimal standard of review, we hold that there is no violation of equal protection and it is entirely rational for the BIA to rely on the law of the convicting state to determine whether a juvenile has been convicted as an adult. We have held that the definition of a \"conviction\" as defined in &#167; 101(a)(48) \"applies even if both the predicate offense and the penalty therefor are creatures of state law.\" Herrera-Inirio, 208 F.3d at 306. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, it is beyond our jurisdiction to determine whether a state court adjudicates its criminal defendants as adults or juveniles. Once the determination is made, we are thereby bound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State.

We disagree. Under our dual system of criminal justice, there are innumerable instances where the sentence of a convicted defendant will be lesser or greater depending on where the defendant is tried, in one state or another or, as here, in a federal court or a state court. The most drastic penalty of all--the death penalty--depends on where the crime has been committed. Disparate treatment of those accused of a crime is an inevitable concomitant of separate federal and state jurisdictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have given greater weight to the laws of the convicting state than to a comparable federal law.

The petitioner now, for the first time, attempts to supplement the record by submitting an appendix with copies of those court records. The respondent has moved to strike the records from the appendix on the grounds that they are not properly before this court because they pertain to matters outside the administrative record. We agree and grant the respondent's motion to strike.

In March 1996, the petitioner committed a criminal offense,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the State of Rhode Island filed a delinquency petition in Rhode Island Family Court. The petition was dismissed, however, and the petitioner was charged as an adult.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As we understand it, the case against the petitioner was eventually dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 26, 1996, the petitioner attempted to steal platinum tire rims from an automobile in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 11-41-6, 11-41-5, and 11-41-1. At the time of this offense, the petitioner was four days shy of his eighteenth birthday. Because he had been waived out of juvenile court after the first offense, he was charged as an adult for the second offense. See R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 14-1-7.1(c) (\"waiver of jurisdiction over a child . . . shall constitute a waiver of jurisdiction over that child for the offense upon which the motion is based as well as for all pending and subsequent offenses of whatever nature ....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner pled guilty to the charges and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years, with two years to serve, eight years suspended, and eight years probation. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (\"INS\") brought removal proceedings against the petitioner on the ground that he was subject to removal from the United States pursuant to section237(a)(2)(A)(iii) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"), as amended, because he was convicted, after admission to the United States, of an aggravated felony as described in INA &#167;101(a)(43)(G) (\"a theft offense . . . for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his removal proceedings before the IJ, the petitioner argued that the IJ should apply federal law for purposes of determining deportability. Under the Federal Juvenile Delinquency Act (\"FJDA\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 5031, a juvenile is defined as one who has not attained his eighteenth birthday. The petitioner argued that because he was only seventeen, \"the offense was a delinquency and not a conviction for immigration purposes.\" The IJ disagreed and rejected the petitioner's plea to apply federal law. The IJ noted that the proceedings took place within the United States, as opposed to a foreign nation, and that the petitioner had been treated as an adult in Rhode Island courts, not as a juvenile. The IJ held that the petitioner had been \"convicted\" of an aggravated felony after admission and was deportable as charged. The IJ ordered him removed to Cape Verde.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner appealed the IJ's order to the BIA, repeating his argument that because he was in federal immigration proceedings, whether or not he has a \"conviction\" for immigration purposes should be determined by federal law, not Rhode Island state law. He argued that applying the FJDA, as opposed to state law, would avoid disparate treatment for the same offense depending solely on where the offense had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA, in a per curiam decision, dismissed the petitioner's appeal. The BIA applied the new definition of \"conviction\" found at &#167; 101(a)(48) of the INA, which was introduced as part of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Rehabilitation Act of 1996 (\"IIRIRA\"). See IIRIRA, Pub. L. No. 104-208, &#167; 322, 110 Stat. 3009.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA stated that \"[i]n passing this legislation [the IIRIRA], Congress could have, but did not, exclude juvenile offenses . . . .\" The BIA also commented on the legislative history of the IIRIRA, noting that the definition of conviction was deliberately broadened beyond that of the prior definition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA ultimately determined that Congress's intent to expand the definition of conviction is clear and there is \"no need to adopt a federal standard for adjudicating removal cases for those aliens who have received convictions prior to their 18th birthday.\" It dismissed the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to this court, the petitioner reiterates the same arguments that were presented to both the IJ and the BIA. He further contends that the BIA failed to articulate any reasoned explanation for treating him differently from other classes of juveniles and thus denied him his constitutional right to equal protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We bifurcate our analysis: First, we address the BIA's construction of the statute defining \"conviction\" for immigration purposes as it relates to the particular facts in this case. Then we address the petitioner's constitutional claim that the BIA violated his right to equal protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Was the petitioner \"convicted\"?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We review de novo an agency's construction of a statute that it administers, subject, however, to established principles of deference.\" Herrera-Inirio v.

In 1988, the BIA, in Matter of Ozkok, 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 546, 551-52 (BIA 1988), attempted to ensure uniformity by creating a three-part definition of \"conviction.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> That effort to produce uniformity failed and, in 1996, Congress enacted the IIRIRA, which, among other things, added the current definition of conviction to the INA. See INA &#167;101(a)(48)(A); 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(48)(A). The current definition of \"conviction\" as it relates to immigration is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"conviction\" means, with respect to an alien, a formal judgment of guilt of the alien entered by a court or, if adjudication of guilt has been withheld, where--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) a judge or jury has found the alien guilty or the alien has entered a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or has admitted sufficient facts to warrant a finding of guilt, and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) the judge has ordered some form of punishment, penalty, or restraint on the alien's liberty to be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INA &#167; 101(a)(48)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Herrera-Inirio, we held that it was Congress's intent to \"broaden[] the scope of the definition of 'conviction' beyond that adopted by the Board of Immigration Appeals in Matter of Ozkok.\" 208 F.3d at 305 (quoting H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-828, at 244 (1996)). We stated that \"[t]his language leaves nothing to the imagination.\" Id. at 304.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We follow that holding in the present case. The statute is clear and unambiguous. Applying the statute, we hold that the petitioner does have a \"conviction.\" He does not contest that he pled guilty to the charges levied against him or that the judge ordered punishment in the form of imprisonment. What he does contest is the fact that he was a juvenile at the time of the offense and therefore should not be found to have a \"conviction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">He argues that we should apply the FJDA to his case and conclude that he does not have a \"conviction\" for immigration purposes. Such a determination would allow him to remain in this country. The petitioner argues that because he was only seventeen, \"the offense was a delinquency and not a conviction for immigration purposes.\" We disagree. The petitioner was adjudicated as an adult in the Rhode Island state court. The BIA held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time an alien has been served a Notice to Appear and appears within the jurisdiction of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, he or she has already been adjudicated as an adult or a juvenile within the jurisdiction of the criminal court; the Immigration Court need not enter into this consideration and is free to apply section 101(a)(48) of the Act. Whether or not a state court adjudicates an alien's criminal behavior in juvenile proceedings falls outside of our jurisdiction . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree. Neither we nor the BIA have jurisdiction to determine how a state court should adjudicate its defendants. Once adjudicated by the state court, as either a juvenile or an adult, we are bound by that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that if a juvenile is prosecuted under foreign laws, the BIA will apply the FJDA to determine whether he had a juvenile delinquency or an adult \"conviction\" for immigration purposes. See, e.g., Matter of De La Nues, 18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 140 (BIA 1981); Matter of Ramirez-Rivero, 18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 135 (BIA 1981). The petitioner urges us to expand that ruling to cover juveniles prosecuted under state laws, and invites us to adopt a federal standard for determining if a petitioner who commits an offense prior to his eighteenth birthday has a \"conviction\" for immigration purposes. The plain language of the statute forbids us from adopting such a standard. If Congress had wanted the INS to follow the FJDA at all times, it would have so stated. We hold that this petitioner has a \"conviction\" as defined by INA &#167;101(a)(48).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Does this violate the petitioner's right to equal protection?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner next argues that failure to apply the FJDA violates his right to equal protection. He claims that similarly situated persons--persons of the same age, who commit the same offense--will be treated differently depending on where they commit the offense. This is quite a stretch for the equal protection doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There can be no doubt that aliens are entitled to equal protection of the law.

Reno, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></span>, 31 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is a \"minimal standard of review,\" and the distinction \"must be upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose.\" Almon, 192 F.3d at 31. We also note that \"the government need not actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this minimal standard of review, we hold that there is no violation of equal protection and it is entirely rational for the BIA to rely on the law of the convicting state to determine whether a juvenile has been convicted as an adult. We have held that the definition of a \"conviction\" as defined in &#167; 101(a)(48) \"applies even if both the predicate offense and the penalty therefor are creatures of state law.\" Herrera-Inirio, 208 F.3d at 306. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, it is beyond our jurisdiction to determine whether a state court adjudicates its criminal defendants as adults or juveniles.

We disagree. Under our dual system of criminal justice, there are innumerable instances where the sentence of a convicted defendant will be lesser or greater depending on where the defendant is tried, in one state or another or, as here, in a federal court or a state court. The most drastic penalty of all--the death penalty--depends on where the crime has been committed.
