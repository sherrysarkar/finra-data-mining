Accordingly,\r\n\nthe  Commissioner awarded SSI  benefits but denied disability\r\n\nbenefits.    On  appeal,  the  district  court  affirmed  the\r\n\nCommissioner's decision.1\r                                    1\r\n\n     At step two of the  evaluation process, claimant has the\r\n\nburden of proving \"that he has a medically  severe impairment\r\n\nor  combination of impairments.\"   Bowen v.

Ruling  85-28 clarifies  that  the step  two  severity\r\n\nrequirement  is  intended  \"to do  no  more  than  screen out\r\n\ngroundless  claims.\"   McDonald v.  Secretary  of Health  and\r                                                                         \r\n\nHuman Services, 795 F.2d 1118, 1124 (1st Cir. 1986).\r                          \r\n\n     On appeal,  claimant challenges only  the ALJ's  finding\r\n\nthat claimant did not suffer from a severe mental  impairment\r\n\nprior  to December  31,  1985.   \"[This  court's] inquiry  on\r\n\nappeal  is limited to determining whether the record contains\r\n\nsubstantial evidence  to support  the Secretary's  findings.\"\r\n\nBarrientos,  820 F.2d at  2.  \"Substantial  evidence is 'more\r                      \r\n\nthan a mere scintilla.

Therefore,\r\n\nSocial Security Ruling  83-20 required the  ALJ to consult  a\r\n\nmedical advisor.  See Bailey v.  Chater, 68 F.3d 75,  79 (4th\r                                                   \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nCir. 1995);  Spellman v.

See Arnone  v. Bowen, 882  F.2d 34, 39\r                                                       \r\n\n(2d  Cir.  1989)  (noting   that  dearth  of  contemporaneous\r\n\nevidence does not necessarily preclude claimant's entitlement\r\n\nto a  \"period of disability,\"  20 CFR S404.320).   Mr. Karp's\r\n\nopinion, as the  retrospective opinion of a  treating source,\r\n\nis entitled to \"significant weight.\"  Dousewicz, 646 F.2d  at\r                                                           \r\n\n774;  see  also Deblois  v.

Neither  Dr.  Lichtenstein's  statement  that\r\n\nclaimant had  been \"fully  and totally disabled  . .  . since\r\n\n1990,\" nor any other medical  evidence in the record directly\r\n\ncontradicts  Mr. Karp's  opinion that  claimant was  severely\r\n\nimpaired by his mental disability prior to December 31, 1985.\r\n\nDr.  Lichtenstein's  refusal  to give  an  opinion  about the\r\n\nstatus of claimant's  mental condition in the  pre-DLI period\r\n\nsuggests  that the  general practitioner  had  not formed  an\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nopinion  about the  severity of  claimant's mental  condition\r\n\nduring  the relevant period.  \"[N]or is there 'overwhelmingly\r\n\ncompelling' non-medical evidence to the contrary  as required\r\n\nby  Wagner in  the absence  of  competing medical  opinions.\"\r                      \r\n\nRivera v. Sullivan, 923 F.2d 964, 969 (2d Cir. 1991) (quoting\r                              \r\n\nWagner v. Secretary  of Health and  Human Services, 906  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n856, 862 (2d Cir. 1990)).\r\n\n     We conclude  that the  evidence was  at least  ambiguous\r\n\nwith respect to  whether the claimant met his  burden at step\r\n\ntwo to  show that  his mental impairment  was not  slight and\r\n\nthat it had \"'more than a minimal  effect on . . . ability to\r\n\nperform basic work activities' within the meaning of SSR  85-\r\n\n28.\"   Fernandez v. Secretary  of Health and  Human Services,\r                                                                        \r\n\n826 F.2d 164, 167 (1st Cir. 1987).  Therefore, the ALJ should\r\n\nhave  consulted with a medical  advisor to determine the date\r\n\non which  claimant's mental  impairment became  severe.   The\r\n\njudgment of  the district court  is vacated, and the  case is\r\n\nremanded  so  that  it   may  be  further  remanded   to  the\r\n\nCommissioner for additional  proceedings consistent with this\r\n\nopinion.\r\n\n     Vacated and Remanded.\r                                     \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n",
