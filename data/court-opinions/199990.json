Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                 Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Rafael A. Oliveras Lopez de Victoria on brief for appellants.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Miguel A. Fernández and\nIsabel Muñoz-Acosta, Assistant United States Attorneys, on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                           May 14, 2002\n\f            Per Curiam.   This is an appeal from an order dismissing\n\na suit brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1346(b), 2671-2680.        The incident giving rise to the underlying\n\nlitigation   —    described    in   the   pleadings   as   a   sexual   assault\n\nperpetrated by a military recruiter on a teenage girl desirous of\n\nexploring enlistment opportunities — is nothing short of tragic,\n\nand the conduct attributed to the recruiter is unpardonable.                The\n\nproblem, however, is that the FTCA contains an explicit exclusion\n\nfor \"[a]ny claim arising out of assault [or] battery . . . .\"               Id.\n\n§ 2680(h).       The Supreme Court has described that exclusion as\n\n\"sweeping,\" commenting that it not only \"bar[s] claims for assault\n\nor battery\" but also \"excludes any claim arising out of assault or\n\nbattery.\"     United States v. Shearer, 473 U.S. 52, 55 (1985)\n\n(emphasis in original).       This case falls squarely within Shearer's\n\nprecedential orbit.\n\n            To be sure, the plaintiffs hint at a possible cause of\n\naction for breach of some independent governmental duty (such as\n\nthe duty to train or supervise the lecherous recruiter).                But, as\n\nthe district court persuasively explained, the facts contained in\n\nthe summary judgment record simply do not sustain any claim of\n\nbreach.     The plaintiffs' effort to bring their case within the\n\ndoctrinal reach of Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 524 U.S. 775,\n\n786-92 (1998), also fails; the plaintiffs did not include a \"sexual\n\nharassment\" or \"hostile environment\" ground in their administrative\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fclaim     under    the   FTCA,    and   they    have     not   complied   with    the\n\nantecedent procedural requirements for filing suit under Title VII,\n\n42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2000e-17.\n\n             We need go no further.          Where, as here, a trial judge has\n\nastutely taken the measure of a case and has handed down not one,\n\nbut two, carefully considered decisions, see Piñero-Ocana v. United\n\nStates, Civ. No. 97-1332 (D.P.R. Sept. 29, 2000) (opinion granting\n\nsummary judgment); Piñero-Ocana v. United States, Civ. No. 97-1332\n\n(D.P.R.     Aug.    9,   2001)     (order      denying    reconsideration),       \"an\n\nappellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other\n\nend than to hear its own words resonate.\"                    Lawton v. State Mut.\n\nLife Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996).                  In this case,\n\nit   is   enough    to   say     that   we   affirm    the     judgment   below   for\n\nessentially the reasons elucidated in Chief Judge Laffitte's well-\n\nreasoned rescripts.        The plaintiffs are, of course, free to pursue\n\ntheir tort claims against the recruiter in a court of competent\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.     1st Cir.
