Upon careful  review  of the  briefs  and\r                           \r\n\nrecord, we perceive  no reason to set  aside appellant's plea\r\n\nor sentence.\r\n\n     The  plea proceedings  reveal  no fundamental  defect or\r\n\nmiscarriage of justice.   Appellant's argument  regarding the\r\n\nscope of 18 U.S.C.   371 is  meritless.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBrandon, 17 F.3d 409, 422  (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n820 (1994).  The  record does not support appellant's  claims\r\n\nthat  his plea  was coerced  and that  the plea  colloquy was\r\n\nconfusing  or inadequate.   Further,  as  the district  court\r\n\ncarefully ascertained the voluntariness of appellant's  plea,\r\n\nand his plea  agreement reflected the  reciprocal arrangement\r\n\nwith the codefendant,  we are not compelled to  set aside the\r\n\nplea.

And,  by providing that the  restitution order\r\n\nwas subject to reconsideration, the district court adequately\r\n\ntook into account appellant's ability to pay.  \r\n\n     Appellant's  remaining  arguments do  not  merit further\r\n\ncomment.\r\n\n     We   do  not   address   appellant's  claims   regarding\r\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel,  as such  claims must  be\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\npresented to  the district court  in the first instance  in a\r\n\nmotion under 28 U.S.C.   2255.  \r\n\n     Affirmed.
