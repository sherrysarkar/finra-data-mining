Trenkler appeals district court orders denying his various\r\n\nmotions for a  new trial, for an inquiry  into possible juror\r\n\nmisconduct, and  for an evidentiary  hearing on the  basis of\r\n\nnewly acquired evidence.  We conclude that the district court\r\n\nproperly denied the motions, and, therefore, we affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                 Facts and Procedural History\r                             Facts and Procedural History\r                                                         \r\n\n          On November 29,  1993, defendant  was convicted  of\r\n\nconspiracy  under 18  U.S.C.     371,  receipt  of  explosive\r\n\nmaterials under 18  U.S.C.   844(d), and  attempted malicious\r\n\ndestruction  of property  by means of  an explosive  under 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   844(i), for  his role in creating  a pipe bomb  that\r\n\nresulted in  the death of  one Boston bomb squad  officer and\r\n\nthe serious injury of another officer.\r\n\n          In his appeal to this court, we held that the trial\r\n\ncourt  had  erred  by admitting  evidence  from  a  Bureau of\r\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco and  Firearms (\"ATF\") computerized  database\r\n\nof  bombings (\"EXIS\"), which the government had introduced at\r\n\ntrial under the catch-all exception to the hearsay rule, Fed.\r\n\nR. Evid. 803(24), to establish the identity of the bombmaker.\r\n\nSee  United States  v. Trenkler,  61  F.3d 45,  59 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1995).  We reasoned that the government had  not convincingly\r\n\ndemonstrated  the reliability of  the EXIS database evidence.\r\n\nSee  id.   We also  concluded,  however, that  the error  was\r                    \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nharmless  beyond a reasonable doubt, principally on the basis\r\n\nthat  a government witness and convicted felon, William David\r\n\nLindholm, had  testified that  defendant had  built the  pipe\r\n\nbomb  at issue, but also on the basis that the government had\r\n\nprovided ample evidence, including out of court statements by\r\n\ndefendant's  alleged  co-conspirator,  Thomas  Shay, Jr.,  to\r\n\nestablish a relationship between defendant and Shay  Jr.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 60-61.\r\n\n          Developments subsequent to defendant's appeal bring\r\n\nhim before us  once again.  First, defendant  learned from an\r\n\narticle in the Boston Globe  on August 1, 1995, that Lindholm\r\n\nhad been released from prison on September 30, 1994,  thirty-\r\n\nseven months into his ninety-seven month sentence.  On August\r\n\n8, 1995, defendant  filed with this court a  motion to remand\r\n\nfor  an  inquiry  into a  possible  undisclosed  deal between\r\n\nLindholm and the  government.   We denied  the motion because\r\n\nthe district court was the proper forum for the request.\r\n\n          Second, on June  22, 1995,  we held  in Shay  Jr.'s\r\n\nappeal  of his conviction arising from the same incident that\r\n\nthe district  court had erred  by excluding testimony  by Dr.\r\n\nRobert Phillips that Shay Jr.'s incriminating statements were\r\n\nunreliable because Shay Jr. suffered from a recognized mental\r\n\ndisorder known as  \"pseudologia fantastica.\"  On  remand, the\r\n\ndistrict  court held  that the  doctor's  testimony was  both\r\n\nreliable  and relevant and was, accordingly, admissible as an\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n\"alternative,  non-incriminating explanation  for Shay  Jr.'s\r\n\nseemingly  incriminating  statements.\"   The results  of Shay\r\n\nJr.'s appeal are  relevant to defendant Trenkler  because, on\r\n\nthe basis of  the district court's original  exclusion of the\r\n\nstatements in  Shay Jr.'s  trial,  defendant's trial  counsel\r\n\nconcluded that  it would be  futile to seek to  introduce the\r\n\ndoctor's  testimony in  defendant's trial  and  thus did  not\r\n\nattempt to do so.\r\n\n          Finally,  on  October 15,  1996,  defendant learned\r\n\nthat a woman  named Donna Shea had  notified the ATF  that an\r\n\nalternate  juror  at  his  trial,  Ramona  Walsh,  had  known\r\n\ndefendant.   During  voir  dire  Walsh  had not  admitted  to\r                                           \r\n\nknowing defendant.  The government initiated an investigation\r\n\ninto  Shea's  allegations,  pursuant to  which  an  ATF agent\r\n\ninterviewed both Shea  and a third  party, Nancy Tolmie  (now\r\n\nNancy   Russell).    Shea  claimed  in  her  interviews  that\r\n\nalternate  juror Walsh  had  been present  at  three or  four\r\n\ncocaine sales that Shea had made to Tolmie twelve years prior\r\n\nto the Trenkler  trial.  Further, she claimed  that defendant\r\n\nmay have been present at those sales.  Tolmie admitted in her\r\n\ninterview that she had purchased cocaine from Shea during the\r\n\ntime period in  question, but she denied that  Walsh had ever\r\n\naccompanied  her on  those occasions.   In  an ATF  Report of\r\n\nInvestigation,   the   government   concluded   that   Shea's\r\n\nallegations were groundless.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Subsequently,  on  the  basis of  Lindholm's  early\r\n\nrelease from prison,  and this court's evidentiary  ruling in\r\n\nShay Jr.'s appeal on the testimony of Dr. Phillips, defendant\r\n\nfiled in  the district court  on December 22, 1995,  a motion\r\n\nfor  a  new  trial  pursuant  to Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  33  or,\r\n\nalternatively, an evidentiary hearing based on newly acquired\r\n\nevidence.   While that  motion was  pending, on  November 19,\r\n\n1996, Trenkler filed a motion for inquiry into possible juror\r\n\nmisconduct  and  for a  new  trial  on  the basis  of  Shea's\r\n\nallegations regarding Walsh.   The district court  denied the\r\n\nmotions, respectively, on February 4, 1997, and May 22, 1997.\r\n\nThis appeal followed.  \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\nA.  Juror Misconduct\r                                \r\n\n          Defendant  first  argues  that the  district  court\r\n\nabused its  discretion in denying his motion for inquiry into\r\n\npossible  juror  misconduct and  for a  new trial  because it\r\n\nfailed  to  conduct  an  independent  inquiry  regarding  the\r\n\nmisconduct allegation.   Specifically,  he contends that  the\r\n\ncourt's  failure to  conduct an  inquiry and  to grant  a new\r\n\ntrial based on  the allegations of juror  misconduct violated\r\n\nhis  Sixth Amendment  right to  an impartial  jury.   He also\r\n\ncontends  that  the  court  improperly  based   its  findings\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nentirely on statements obtained for the government by the ATF\r\n\nagent.\r\n\n          We review a district court's determination  that no\r\n\njuror misconduct occurred  for a patent abuse  of discretion.\r\n\nSee United States  v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d 955,  961 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1989).  We likewise  review the denial of a motion  for a new\r\n\ntrial for manifest abuse of discretion.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nTibolt, 72 F.3d 965, 972 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                  \r\n\n          As an initial  matter, we note  that the court  was\r\n\njustified in  relying  on  the  report  of  the  ATF  agent's\r\n\ninterviews with Shea  and Tolmie.  As  the government rightly\r\n\npoints  out,  it was  the  government who  first  brought the\r\n\ncharge of juror  misconduct to the attention  of the district\r\n\ncourt,  and defendant  failed to  present  any evidence  that\r\n\nwould place into question the accuracy of the report.\r\n\n          We next turn  to the court's determinations.   When\r\n\nthere has been a  \"nonfrivolous suggestion\" of juror bias  or\r\n\nmisconduct, \"the  district court must  undertake an  adequate\r\n\ninquiry  to determine  whether the alleged  incident occurred\r\n\nand if  so, whether  it was prejudicial.\"   United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGaston-Brito,  64 F.3d  11,  12  (1st  Cir.  1995)  (internal\r                        \r\n\ncitations  omitted).     Although   this  threshold   is  not\r\n\nparticularly high, see Neron v. Tierney, 841 F.2d  1197, 1202\r                                                   \r\n\nn.6 (1st Cir.  1988), the district court shall not \"intru[de]\r\n\ninto  the  sphere  of  jury privacy,\"  id.  at  1205, without\r                                                      \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nevidence  \"sufficient  to   undergird  genuine  doubts  about\r\n\nimpartiality,\" id. at 1202.\r                              \r\n\n          Defendant has presented  no such evidence.   As the\r\n\ndistrict court observed,  Shea did not claim  that Walsh knew\r\n\nanything about defendant  or had ever spoken to  him, nor had\r\n\nshe alleged  any other facts  that would lead one  to believe\r\n\nthat  Walsh would  recognize  defendant  twelve years  later.\r\n\nMoreover, not  only did Tolmie contradict  Shea's allegations\r\n\nbut, in addition, Shea herself contradicted them by admitting\r\n\nthat defendant did not know \"or have any dealings with\" Walsh\r\n\nduring  the relevant  time period.    On the  basis of  these\r\n\ncircumstances alone we find that the district court committed\r\n\nno   patent  abuse  of  discretion  in  finding  that  Shea's\r\n\nallegations  of   misconduct  by  an  alternate   juror  were\r\n\nconjectural and did  not trigger a duty to  investigate.  The\r\n\ncourt therefore committed no abuse of discretion in denying a\r\n\nnew trial.\r\n\nB.  Newly Discovered Evidence\r                                         \r\n\n          Defendant's  second argument  is that  the district\r\n\ncourt abused its  discretion in denying his motion  for a new\r\n\ntrial  or, alternatively,  an  evidentiary  hearing based  on\r\n\nnewly  acquired  evidence,   because  it  used  inappropriate\r\n\nstandards  in  considering  the  newly  discovered   evidence\r\n\nregarding Lindholm,  and  because it  improperly declined  to\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nrecognize Dr. Phillips's testimony as \"unavailable\" to him at\r\n\nthe time of his trial.  \r\n\n          We  begin with  the  Lindholm  issue.    In  normal\r\n\ncircumstances,  a  motion for  a  new  trial based  on  newly\r\n\ndiscovered  evidence  must  show that  the  evidence  was (1)\r\n\nunknown or unavailable at the  time of trial, (2) despite due\r\n\ndiligence, (3)  material,  and (4)  likely  to result  in  an\r\n\nacquittal upon retrial.  See  United States v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n21, 27 (1st Cir. 1994).  A less stringent standard  of review\r\n\napplies,   however,  when  the   new  evidence  was   in  the\r\n\ngovernment's  control and  its  disclosure was  withheld, and\r\n\nwhen there is an allegation that a witness committed perjury.\r\n\nIn  particular, in  situations in  which  the government  has\r\n\nwithheld evidence, a court should  grant a new trial if there\r\n\nis  a \"reasonable probability\"  that the evidence  would have\r\n\nchanged  the  result.   Tibolt,  72  F.3d  at 971.    Perjury\r                                          \r\n\nallegations  should prompt  a  new trial  when  the court  is\r\n\n\"reasonably-well satisfied\" that the testimony was false  and\r\n\nthat,  without  the  false testimony,  the  jury  \"might have\r\n\nreached a  different result.\"   United States v.  Wright, 625\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  1017, 1020 (1st Cir. 1980) (internal citation omitted).\r\n\n          In this case, there is no basis for applying a more\r\n\nlenient standard.   The district court rightly  observed that\r\n\nnothing  in  the  record  indicates  that  Lindholm  perjured\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nhimself or that his early  release from prison was the result\r\n\nof a deal made  prior to the trial that the government failed\r\n\nto  disclose.  Rather,  all evidence, including  an affidavit\r\n\nfrom  an  assistant  U.S. Attorney  which  defendant  has not\r\n\nchallenged,  unequivocally  leads  to  the  conclusion   that\r\n\nLindholm's early  release arrangement was made several months\r\n\nafter the  Trenkler trial.   The district court's use  of the\r\n\nmore   stringent   standard    was   therefore   appropriate.\r\n\nFurthermore,   that  there  is  no  evidence  of  perjury  or\r\n\nnondisclosure  by  itself   suffices  to  defeat  defendant's\r\n\nargument: there  is simply  no basis,  under the  first Ortiz\r                                                                         \r\n\nfactor, on which  to conclude that the \"new  evidence\" or any\r\n\nagreement associated with it even  existed at the time of the\r\n\ntrial.  Accordingly,  our independent review of  the evidence\r\n\nconvinces us  that  the  district court  did  not  abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion in denying an evidentiary hearing and  a new trial\r\n\non this issue.\r\n\n          Defendant's  next  claim  is  that  Dr.  Phillips's\r\n\ntestimony  regarding  Shay  Jr.'s  condition  of  pseudologia\r\n\nfantastica  constitutes   newly  discovered  evidence.     In\r\n\nparticular, defendant argues that his trial counsel chose not\r\n\nto  offer  the  testimony  because  the  district  court  had\r\n\nexcluded it at Shay  Jr.'s trial and  that our remand of  the\r\n\ntestimony issue  in  that  case to  the  district  court  for\r\n\nfurther consideration rendered the testimony newly discovered\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nevidence.  We, like the district court, reject this argument.\r\n\n          Under no  interpretation  of the  standard was  Dr.\r\n\nPhillips's  testimony unknown or  unavailable at the  time of\r\n\ndefendant's  trial.   That the  district  court excluded  the\r\n\ntestimony  in Shay  Jr.'s trial  and  that defendant's  trial\r\n\ncounsel believed it would be  futile to offer it in  light of\r\n\nthe prior trial do not excuse him from making the offer.  The\r\n\ndecision of defendant's  trial counsel  in this  case not  to\r\n\noffer  the testimony  may have  been  part of  his reasonable\r\n\ntrial strategy: although  some of Shay Jr.'s  statements were\r\n\nnot favorable to  Trenkler, some of his  admissions supported\r\n\nTrenkler's  defense.  Thus, trial counsel may have determined\r\n\nthat  it would  be  unwise to  risk  discrediting Shay  Jr.'s\r\n\nadmissions,  even for the sake of discrediting his statements\r\n\nabout the existence of a  co-conspiracy between Shay Jr.  and\r\n\ndefendant.   In any event,  the district court did  not abuse\r\n\nits  discretion in  concluding  that the  proffered testimony\r\n\nfailed  to meet  the  first  prong of  the  Ortiz test,  thus\r                                                             \r\n\ndenying defendant's motion on this issue.\r\n\n          In  sum, the  district  court  did  not  abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion with regard to any of the issues in this appeal.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed\r                              \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n",

Evid. 803(24), to establish the identity of the bombmaker.\r\n\nSee  United States  v.

We reasoned that the government had  not convincingly\r\n\ndemonstrated  the reliability of  the EXIS database evidence.\r\n\nSee  id.   We also  concluded,  however, that  the error  was\r                    \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nharmless  beyond a reasonable doubt, principally on the basis\r\n\nthat  a government witness and convicted felon, William David\r\n\nLindholm, had  testified that  defendant had  built the  pipe\r\n\nbomb  at issue, but also on the basis that the government had\r\n\nprovided ample evidence, including out of court statements by\r\n\ndefendant's  alleged  co-conspirator,  Thomas  Shay, Jr.,  to\r\n\nestablish a relationship between defendant and Shay  Jr.  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 60-61.\r\n\n          Developments subsequent to defendant's appeal bring\r\n\nhim before us  once again.  First, defendant  learned from an\r\n\narticle in the Boston Globe  on August 1, 1995, that Lindholm\r\n\nhad been released from prison on September 30, 1994,  thirty-\r\n\nseven months into his ninety-seven month sentence.  On August\r\n\n8, 1995, defendant  filed with this court a  motion to remand\r\n\nfor  an  inquiry  into a  possible  undisclosed  deal between\r\n\nLindholm and the  government.   We denied  the motion because\r\n\nthe district court was the proper forum for the request.\r\n\n          Second, on June  22, 1995,  we held  in Shay  Jr.'s\r\n\nappeal  of his conviction arising from the same incident that\r\n\nthe district  court had erred  by excluding testimony  by Dr.\r\n\nRobert Phillips that Shay Jr.'s incriminating statements were\r\n\nunreliable because Shay Jr. suffered from a recognized mental\r\n\ndisorder known as  \"pseudologia fantastica.\"  On  remand, the\r\n\ndistrict  court held  that the  doctor's  testimony was  both\r\n\nreliable  and relevant and was, accordingly, admissible as an\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n\"alternative,  non-incriminating explanation  for Shay  Jr.'s\r\n\nseemingly  incriminating  statements.\"   The results  of Shay\r\n\nJr.'s appeal are  relevant to defendant Trenkler  because, on\r\n\nthe basis of  the district court's original  exclusion of the\r\n\nstatements in  Shay Jr.'s  trial,  defendant's trial  counsel\r\n\nconcluded that  it would be  futile to seek to  introduce the\r\n\ndoctor's  testimony in  defendant's trial  and  thus did  not\r\n\nattempt to do so.\r\n\n          Finally,  on  October 15,  1996,  defendant learned\r\n\nthat a woman  named Donna Shea had  notified the ATF  that an\r\n\nalternate  juror  at  his  trial,  Ramona  Walsh,  had  known\r\n\ndefendant.   During  voir  dire  Walsh  had not  admitted  to\r                                           \r\n\nknowing defendant.  The government initiated an investigation\r\n\ninto  Shea's  allegations,  pursuant to  which  an  ATF agent\r\n\ninterviewed both Shea  and a third  party, Nancy Tolmie  (now\r\n\nNancy   Russell).    Shea  claimed  in  her  interviews  that\r\n\nalternate  juror Walsh  had  been present  at  three or  four\r\n\ncocaine sales that Shea had made to Tolmie twelve years prior\r\n\nto the Trenkler  trial.  Further, she claimed  that defendant\r\n\nmay have been present at those sales.  Tolmie admitted in her\r\n\ninterview that she had purchased cocaine from Shea during the\r\n\ntime period in  question, but she denied that  Walsh had ever\r\n\naccompanied  her on  those occasions.   In  an ATF  Report of\r\n\nInvestigation,   the   government   concluded   that   Shea's\r\n\nallegations were groundless.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Subsequently,  on  the  basis of  Lindholm's  early\r\n\nrelease from prison,  and this court's evidentiary  ruling in\r\n\nShay Jr.'s appeal on the testimony of Dr. Phillips, defendant\r\n\nfiled in  the district court  on December 22, 1995,  a motion\r\n\nfor  a  new  trial  pursuant  to Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  33  or,\r\n\nalternatively, an evidentiary hearing based on newly acquired\r\n\nevidence.   While that  motion was  pending, on  November 19,\r\n\n1996, Trenkler filed a motion for inquiry into possible juror\r\n\nmisconduct  and  for a  new  trial  on  the basis  of  Shea's\r\n\nallegations regarding Walsh.   The district court  denied the\r\n\nmotions, respectively, on February 4, 1997, and May 22, 1997.\r\n\nThis appeal followed.  \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\nA.  Juror Misconduct\r                                \r\n\n          Defendant  first  argues  that the  district  court\r\n\nabused its  discretion in denying his motion for inquiry into\r\n\npossible  juror  misconduct and  for a  new trial  because it\r\n\nfailed  to  conduct  an  independent  inquiry  regarding  the\r\n\nmisconduct allegation.   Specifically,  he contends that  the\r\n\ncourt's  failure to  conduct an  inquiry and  to grant  a new\r\n\ntrial based on  the allegations of juror  misconduct violated\r\n\nhis  Sixth Amendment  right to  an impartial  jury.   He also\r\n\ncontends  that  the  court  improperly  based   its  findings\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nentirely on statements obtained for the government by the ATF\r\n\nagent.\r\n\n          We review a district court's determination  that no\r\n\njuror misconduct occurred  for a patent abuse  of discretion.\r\n\nSee United States  v.

As  the government rightly\r\n\npoints  out,  it was  the  government who  first  brought the\r\n\ncharge of juror  misconduct to the attention  of the district\r\n\ncourt,  and defendant  failed to  present  any evidence  that\r\n\nwould place into question the accuracy of the report.\r\n\n          We next turn  to the court's determinations.   When\r\n\nthere has been a  \"nonfrivolous suggestion\" of juror bias  or\r\n\nmisconduct, \"the  district court must  undertake an  adequate\r\n\ninquiry  to determine  whether the alleged  incident occurred\r\n\nand if  so, whether  it was prejudicial.\"   United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGaston-Brito,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196269\"><a href=\"/opinion/196269/united-states-v-gaston-brito/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  12  (1st  Cir.  1995)  (internal\r                        \r\n\ncitations  omitted).     Although   this  threshold   is  not\r\n\nparticularly high, see Neron v. Tierney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503069\"><a href=\"/opinion/503069/louis-neron-v-james-e-tierney-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1202\r                                                   \r\n\nn.6 (1st Cir.  1988), the district court shall not \"intru[de]\r\n\ninto  the  sphere  of  jury privacy,\"  id.  at  1205, without\r                                                      \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nevidence  \"sufficient  to   undergird  genuine  doubts  about\r\n\nimpartiality,\" id. at 1202.\r                              \r\n\n          Defendant has presented  no such evidence.   As the\r\n\ndistrict court observed,  Shea did not claim  that Walsh knew\r\n\nanything about defendant  or had ever spoken to  him, nor had\r\n\nshe alleged  any other facts  that would lead one  to believe\r\n\nthat  Walsh would  recognize  defendant  twelve years  later.\r\n\nMoreover, not  only did Tolmie contradict  Shea's allegations\r\n\nbut, in addition, Shea herself contradicted them by admitting\r\n\nthat defendant did not know \"or have any dealings with\" Walsh\r\n\nduring  the relevant  time period.    On the  basis of  these\r\n\ncircumstances alone we find that the district court committed\r\n\nno   patent  abuse  of  discretion  in  finding  that  Shea's\r\n\nallegations  of   misconduct  by  an  alternate   juror  were\r\n\nconjectural and did  not trigger a duty to  investigate.  The\r\n\ncourt therefore committed no abuse of discretion in denying a\r\n\nnew trial.\r\n\nB.  Newly Discovered Evidence\r                                         \r\n\n          Defendant's  second argument  is that  the district\r\n\ncourt abused its  discretion in denying his motion  for a new\r\n\ntrial  or, alternatively,  an  evidentiary  hearing based  on\r\n\nnewly  acquired  evidence,   because  it  used  inappropriate\r\n\nstandards  in  considering  the  newly  discovered   evidence\r\n\nregarding Lindholm,  and  because it  improperly declined  to\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nrecognize Dr. Phillips's testimony as \"unavailable\" to him at\r\n\nthe time of his trial.  \r\n\n          We  begin with  the  Lindholm  issue.    In  normal\r\n\ncircumstances,  a  motion for  a  new  trial based  on  newly\r\n\ndiscovered  evidence  must  show that  the  evidence  was (1)\r\n\nunknown or unavailable at the  time of trial, (2) despite due\r\n\ndiligence, (3)  material,  and (4)  likely  to result  in  an\r\n\nacquittal upon retrial.

A less stringent standard  of review\r\n\napplies,   however,  when  the   new  evidence  was   in  the\r\n\ngovernment's  control and  its  disclosure was  withheld, and\r\n\nwhen there is an allegation that a witness committed perjury.\r\n\nIn  particular, in  situations in  which  the government  has\r\n\nwithheld evidence, a court should  grant a new trial if there\r\n\nis  a \"reasonable probability\"  that the evidence  would have\r\n\nchanged  the  result.

Wright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380303\"><a href=\"/opinion/380303/united-states-v-henry-james-wright-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span>\r                                                                    \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1017</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1020 (1st Cir. 1980) (internal citation omitted).\r\n\n          In this case, there is no basis for applying a more\r\n\nlenient standard.   The district court rightly  observed that\r\n\nnothing  in  the  record  indicates  that  Lindholm  perjured\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nhimself or that his early  release from prison was the result\r\n\nof a deal made  prior to the trial that the government failed\r\n\nto  disclose.  Rather,  all evidence, including  an affidavit\r\n\nfrom  an  assistant  U.S. Attorney  which  defendant  has not\r\n\nchallenged,  unequivocally  leads  to  the  conclusion   that\r\n\nLindholm's early  release arrangement was made several months\r\n\nafter the  Trenkler trial.   The district court's use  of the\r\n\nmore   stringent   standard    was   therefore   appropriate.\r\n\nFurthermore,   that  there  is  no  evidence  of  perjury  or\r\n\nnondisclosure  by  itself   suffices  to  defeat  defendant's\r\n\nargument: there  is simply  no basis,  under the  first Ortiz\r                                                                         \r\n\nfactor, on which  to conclude that the \"new  evidence\" or any\r\n\nagreement associated with it even  existed at the time of the\r\n\ntrial.  Accordingly,  our independent review of  the evidence\r\n\nconvinces us  that  the  district court  did  not  abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion in denying an evidentiary hearing and  a new trial\r\n\non this issue.\r\n\n          Defendant's  next  claim  is  that  Dr.  Phillips's\r\n\ntestimony  regarding  Shay  Jr.'s  condition  of  pseudologia\r\n\nfantastica  constitutes   newly  discovered  evidence.     In\r\n\nparticular, defendant argues that his trial counsel chose not\r\n\nto  offer  the  testimony  because  the  district  court  had\r\n\nexcluded it at Shay  Jr.'s trial and  that our remand of  the\r\n\ntestimony issue  in  that  case to  the  district  court  for\r\n\nfurther consideration rendered the testimony newly discovered\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nevidence.  We, like the district court, reject this argument.\r\n\n          Under no  interpretation  of the  standard was  Dr.\r\n\nPhillips's  testimony unknown or  unavailable at the  time of\r\n\ndefendant's  trial.   That the  district  court excluded  the\r\n\ntestimony  in Shay  Jr.'s trial  and  that defendant's  trial\r\n\ncounsel believed it would be  futile to offer it in  light of\r\n\nthe prior trial do not excuse him from making the offer.  The\r\n\ndecision of defendant's  trial counsel  in this  case not  to\r\n\noffer  the testimony  may have  been  part of  his reasonable\r\n\ntrial strategy: although  some of Shay Jr.'s  statements were\r\n\nnot favorable to  Trenkler, some of his  admissions supported\r\n\nTrenkler's  defense.  Thus, trial counsel may have determined\r\n\nthat  it would  be  unwise to  risk  discrediting Shay  Jr.'s\r\n\nadmissions,  even for the sake of discrediting his statements\r\n\nabout the existence of a  co-conspiracy between Shay Jr.  and\r\n\ndefendant.   In any event,  the district court did  not abuse\r\n\nits  discretion in  concluding  that the  proffered testimony\r\n\nfailed  to meet  the  first  prong of  the  Ortiz test,  thus\r                                                             \r\n\ndenying defendant's motion on this issue.\r\n\n          In  sum, the  district  court  did  not  abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion with regard to any of the issues in this appeal.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed\r                              \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n</pre>",
