(\"Southex\") challenges a district court bench\n\nruling that no partnership existed between Southex and the Rhode\n\nIsland      Builder's      Association,      Inc.    (\"RIBA\"),      even   though\n\nSouthex's predecessors in interest had produced home shows for\n\nRIBA in Rhode Island ever since 1974.                 We affirm the district\n\ncourt judgment.\n\n                                        I\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n              In 1974, with the construction of the new Providence\n\nCivic Center (\"Civic Center\") and the expansion in RIBA home\n\nshows, RIBA's executive director, Ross Dagata, decided to enter\n\ninto   an     agreement    with    Sherman    Exposition      Management,     Inc.\n\n(\"SEM\"),      a   Massachusetts-based        professional      show   owner    and\n\nproducer, for future productions of the RIBA home shows at the\n\nCivic Center (\"the 1974 Agreement\").                The preamble in the 1974\n\nAgreement announced that \"RIBA wishes to participate in such\n\n[s]hows as sponsors and partners . . . .\"                   (Emphasis added.)\n\nThe    term    of    the   1974   Agreement    was    fixed    at   five   years,\n\nrenewable by mutual agreement.\n\n              RIBA further agreed (i) to sponsor and endorse only\n\nshows produced by SEM, (ii) to persuade RIBA members to exhibit\n\nat those shows, and (iii) to permit SEM to use RIBA's name for\n\n\n                                        3\n\fpromotional purposes.         In turn, SEM undertook, inter alia, to\n\n(i)    obtain     all    necessary    leases,       licenses,      permits     and\n\ninsurance,       (ii)   indemnify    RIBA   for    show-related      losses    \"of\n\nwhatever sort,\" (iii) accord RIBA the right to accept or reject\n\nany exhibitor, (iv) audit show income, and (v) advance all the\n\ncapital required to finance the shows.              Net show profits were to\n\nbe shared:       55% to SEM; 45% to RIBA.\n\n            The 1974 Agreement further provided that all show dates\n\nand    admission    prices,   as    well    as    the   Rhode    Island   banking\n\ninstitution at which show-related business would be transacted,\n\nwere to be mutually determined by the parties.                  In the event the\n\nCivic Center were to become unavailable for reasons beyond SEM's\n\ncontrol, SEM was to be excused from its production duties,\n\nprovided that SEM promoted no other home show in Rhode Island\n\nduring the interim; and RIBA retained the right to conduct a\n\nhome show at another venue, upon appropriate notification to\n\nSEM.\n\n            In    contemporaneous      conversations        relating      to   the\n\nmeaning of the term \"partners,\" Manual Sherman, SEM's president,\n\ninformed RIBA's Ross Dagata that he \"wanted no ownership of the\n\nshow,\" because he was uncertain about the financial prospects\n\nfor home shows in the Rhode Island market.                       Manual Sherman\n\nadvised Dagata:         \"[A]fter the first year, if I'm not happy, we\n\n\n                                       4\n\fcan't produce the show properly or make any money, we'll give\n\nyou back the show.\"       Although SEM owned other home shows which\n\nit produced outside Rhode Island, Manual Sherman consistently\n\ndescribed himself simply as the \"producer\" of the RIBA shows.\n\n            In 1994, following a series of assignments and contract\n\nrenewals agreed to by RIBA, Southex acquired SEM'S interest\n\nunder the 1974 Agreement.1         By 1998, Southex determined that in\n\norder to maintain its financial stake in the RIBA home shows,\n\nthe 1974 Agreement either needed to be renegotiated or allowed\n\nto   expire   according   to   its   terms   in   1999.      RIBA   in   turn\n\nexpressed     dissatisfaction      with   Southex's    performance,       and\n\neventually    entered   into   a    management    contract   with   another\n\nproducer, Yoffee Exposition Services, Inc.\n\n            Southex commenced suit against RIBA in federal district\n\ncourt, to enjoin the RIBA 2000 home show, alleging that the 1974\n\nAgreement established a partnership between RIBA and Southex's\n\npredecessor-in-interest (i.e., SEM), and/or that by its silence\n\nRIBA had enabled the formation of a partnership-by-estoppel, and\n\n\n\n      1\n     With regard to the acquisition by Southex, RIBA's Dagata\ninartfully advised the Providence Journal that Reed Exhibitions,\nSEM's successor-in-interest, had \"sold its home shows to\nSouthex.\" One month later, an article appeared in an RIBA trade\npublication entitled: \"Southex Exhibitions acquires Home Show.\"\n(Emphasis added.) In each instance, however, RIBA mitigated any\ninference of co-ownership by referring to Southex as the\n\"producer\" of its shows.\n\n                                      5\n\fthat RIBA breached its fiduciary duties to its co-partner,\n\nSouthex, by its wrongful dissolution of their partnership and\n\nits subsequent appointment of another producer.                       Following an\n\nevidentiary hearing, the district court denied the preliminary\n\ninjunction     requested       by   Southex,      finding      no   likelihood     of\n\nultimate success on the merits.                We affirmed in an unpublished\n\nopinion.     See Southex Exhibitions, Inc. v. R.I. Builders Ass'n,\n\nNo. 00-1247, slip op. at 2 (1st Cir. Mar. 2, 2000) (per curiam).\n\n             At the bench trial following our remand, the district\n\ncourt entertained further evidence, then entered judgment for\n\nRIBA   on    the   ground    that   the    1974    Agreement        established    no\n\npartnership under Rhode Island law, and that Southex had adduced\n\ninsufficient evidence to support its partnership-by-estoppel\n\nclaim.      In due course, Southex brought the instant appeal.\n\n                                          II\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\n             Under     Rhode    Island     law,    a       \"partnership\"   is     \"an\n\nassociation of two (2) or more persons to carry on as co-owners\n\na business for profit . . . .\"                    R.I. Gen. Laws. § 7-12-17\n\n(emphasis added).           The same statute further provides,               inter\n\nalia, that —\n\n             [i]n determining whether                  a    partnership\n             exists, these rules apply:\n\n             . . . .\n\n                                          6\n\f         (2)  Joint tenancy, tenancy in common,\n              tenancy   by  the   entireties,   joint\n              property, common property, or part\n              ownership does not of itself establish\n              a partnership, whether the co-owners do\n              or do not share any profits made by the\n              use of the property.\n         . . . .\n\n               (4)    The receipt by a person of a share\n                      of the profits of a business is\n                      prima facie evidence that he or\n                      she is a partner in the business,\n                      but no such inference is drawn if\n                      profits were received in payment:\n\n               (i)        As a debt by installments or\n                          otherwise;\n               (ii)       As wages of an employee or\n                          rent to a landlord;\n               (iii)      As an annuity to a widow or\n                          representative of a deceased\n                          partner;\n               (iv)       As interest on a loan, though\n                          the amount of payment vary\n                          with  the   profits  of   the\n                          business;\n               (v)        As the consideration for the\n                          sale of a good will of a\n                          business or other property by\n                          installments or otherwise.\n\nId. § 7-12-18.2\n\n\n    2Although there is a dearth of Rhode Island case law\nconstruing section 7-12-18, the Rhode Island legislature has\ncounseled the courts to look to the interpretations which other\nstates have given the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA), upon which\nsection 7-12-18 is based. See R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-12-15(d). We\nheed its counsel. See VanHaaren v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\nCo., 989 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Absent controlling state\ncourt precedent, a federal court sitting in diversity may\ncertify a state law issue to the state's highest court, or\nundertake its prediction 'when the course [the] state courts\n\n                                 7\n\f            While     pure    legal         issues,    such    as     statutory\n\ninterpretations, are reviewed de novo, see R.I. v. Narragansett\n\nIndian     Tribe,     19   F.3d   685,       691   (1st    Cir.     1994),   the\n\ndetermination as to whether a partnership was formed turned\n\nprimarily on factual findings,3 which we review only for clear\n\nerror.4    A finding of fact constitutes clear error only if, after\n\nreviewing the entire trial record, \"we are firmly convinced that\n\na mistake has been made.\"         See Tokyo Marine & Fire Ins. Co. v.\n\nPerez & CIA, de Puerto Rico, Inc., 142 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n1998)     (emphasis    added).     As       the    party   asserting    that   a\n\npartnership was formed, the ultimate burden of persuasion rested\n\nupon Southex.5\n\n\nwould take is relatively clear.'\") (citation omitted).\n     3\n     See, e.g., In re Hassiepen, 646 N.E.2d 1348, 1353 (Ill.\nApp. Ct. 1995); Hofer v. St. Clair, 381 S.E.2d 736, 739 (S.C.\n1989).\n     4\n     See, e.g., Boeckmann v. Mitchell, 909 S.W.2d 308, 312 (Ark.\n1995); Widdoss v. Donahue, 331 N.W.2d 831, 833 (S.D. 1983);\naccord In re Hassiepen, 646 N.E.2d at 1353 (factfinder's\ndetermination can be vacated only if contrary to \"the manifest\nweight of the evidence\").\n     5\n     See Boeckmann, 909 S.W.2d at 312; In re Hassiepen, 646\nN.E.2d at 1353; Tralmer Sales & Serv., Inc. v. Erickson, 521\nN.W.2d 182, 187 (Wis. Ct. App. 1994).      Although some courts\nrequire that partnership formation be established by clear and\nconvincing evidence, see Cochran v. Bd. of Supervisors of Del\nNorte County, 85 Cal. App. 3d 75, 81 (Ct. App. 1978), for\npresent purposes we assume, arguendo, that the Rhode Island\ncourts would adhere to the less burdensome preponderance-of-the-\nevidence standard.\n\n                                        8\n\f          Southex insists that the 1974 Agreement contains ample\n\nindicia that a partnership was formed, including:               (1) a 55-45%\n\nsharing of profits; (2) mutual control over designated business\n\noperations, such as show dates, admission prices, choice of\n\nexhibitors,     and   \"partnership\"        bank    accounts;   and   (3)   the\n\nrespective contributions of valuable property to the partnership\n\nby the partners.         Given the highly deferential standard of\n\nappellate review, however, Southex must do more than point to\n\nsupportive record evidence.          Since it bears the burden of proof,\n\nit must demonstrate that the district court ruling, viewed in\n\nthe light most favorable to RIBA, is not rationally supported by\n\nthe record evidence.        See Damon v. Sun. Co., 87 F.3d 1467, 1477\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).      In our view, the record evidence indicating a\n\nnonpartner relationship cannot be dismissed as insubstantial.\n\n          First,      the     1974    Agreement      is    simply    entitled\n\n\"Agreement,\"    rather      than   \"Partnership      Agreement.\"      Second,\n\nrather   than   an    agreement      for   an     indefinite   duration,    it\n\nprescribed a fixed (albeit renewable) term.               Third, rather than\n\nundertake to share operating costs with RIBA, SEM not only\n\nagreed to advance all monies required to produce the shows, but\n\nto indemnify RIBA for all show-related losses as well.                  State\n\nlaw normally presumes that partners share equally or at least\n\nproportionately in partnership losses.             See R.I. Gen. Laws §§ 7-\n\n\n                                       9\n\f12-26(a),     7-12-29(1)&(2).              Although      partners      may    agree      to\n\noverride     such    statutory          \"default\"    provisions,        there       is   no\n\nevidence that SEM and RIBA meant to do so notwithstanding an\n\nintent to form a partnership.              See 1 Alan R. Bromberg & Larry E.\n\nRibstein, Bromberg and Ribstein on Property § 2.07(d) (1999)\n\n(identifying        \"loss   sharing\"        as    very    important      partnership\n\nattribute).\n\n             Similarly,       although      RIBA     involved        itself    in     some\n\nmanagement decisions, SEM was responsible for the lion's share.\n\nCf.   R.I.   Gen.    Laws     §    7-12-29(5)       (noting    default        rule    that\n\npartners     normally       share        \"equal      rights     in     management\").\n\nFurthermore,        Southex       not    only    entered      into    contracts          but\n\nconducted business with third parties, in its own name, rather\n\nthan in the name of the putative partnership.                         As a matter of\n\nfact, their mutual association was never given a name.                               It is\n\nnoteworthy as well that Southex stipulated at trial that it\n\nnever filed either a federal or state partnership tax return.\n\nSee Cochran v. Bd. of Supervisors of Del Norte County, 85 Cal.\n\nApp. 3d 75, 82 (Ct. App. 1978) (failure to file partnership tax\n\nreturn probative of nonpartner relationship); Wilder v. Hobson,\n\n398 S.E.2d 625, 627 (N.C. Ct. App. 1990) (\"Filing a partnership\n\ntax return is significant evidence of a partnership.\"); Widdoss\n\nv. Donahue, 331 N.W.2d 831, 833 (S.D. 1983).\n\n\n                                           10\n\f              Similarly, the evidence as to whether either SEM or\n\nRIBA contributed any corporate property, with the intent that it\n\nbecome jointly-owned partnership property is highly speculative,\n\nparticularly     since    their      mutual    endeavor   simply   involved    a\n\nperiodic      event,   i.e.,    an    annual    home   show,    which   neither\n\ngenerated, nor necessitated, ownership interests in significant\n\ntangible properties, aside from cash receipts.                 Unlike tangible\n\nreal and personal property, whose ownership is more readily\n\nestablished (e.g., by documentary evidence and public records),\n\nsee, e.g., Harrell Oil Co. of Mt. Airy v. Case, 543 S.E.2d 522,\n\n525 (N.C. Ct. App. 2001) (finding \"overwhelming\" evidence of\n\nownership in \"building, the property, the inventory, and the\n\nequipment\"), the intangible intellectual property involved here,\n\nsuch as clientele lists, goodwill, and business expertise, did\n\nnot so readily lend itself to evidentiary establishment.                   As a\n\nconsequence, in the present circumstances the requisite mutual\n\nintent   to     convert   intangible         intellectual   properties     into\n\npartnership assets may well depend much more importantly upon a\n\nclear contractual expression of mutual intention to form a\n\npartnership.\n\n              Finally, even assuming that the 1974 Agreement, as a\n\nwhole,   is    ambiguous,      (i)   Manuel    Sherman    testified     that   he\n\nregarded SEM as simply the producer of the annual RIBA shows;\n\n\n                                        11\n\fand (ii) Dagata testified that SEM specifically disclaimed any\n\nownership interest in the home shows in 1974.              See Boeckmann v.\n\nMitchell, 909 S.W.2d 308, 312 (Ark. 1995) (where testimony\n\nrelates to partnership formation, appellate court must defer to\n\ntrial court as primary arbiter of witness credibility).\n\n            Next, Southex asserts that the district court committed\n\nreversible error by not crediting undisputed evidence that RIBA,\n\nin 1974, expressly agreed to share business profits with SEM.\n\nSouthex reasons that since the Rhode Island partnership statute\n\nmakes such profit sharing prima facie evidence of partnership\n\nformation, and RIBA failed to rebut that evidentiary presumption\n\nby   establishing       any    of   the    five   exceptions    specified    in\n\nsubsection 7-12-18(4), the district court was required to find,\n\nas   a   matter    of   law,   that   a    partnership   was    formed.     Its\n\nreasoning is flawed.\n\n            \"Partnership\" is a notoriously imprecise term, whose\n\ndefinition is especially elusive in practice.                  See Boeckmann,\n\n909 S.W.2d at 312 (\"[T]he term 'partnership' is not easily\n\nelucidated [and] . . . [t]he business association that is known\n\nin the law as partnership is not one that can be defined with\n\nprecision.

App. 1999) (\"[T]he presence or\n\nabsence of any of the various elements set forth in [the UPA] .\n\n. . is not necessarily dispositive.\").\n\n            Similarly, even though the UPA explicitly identifies\n\nprofit     sharing   as    a    particularly       probative     indicium     of\n\npartnership formation, and some courts have even held that the\n\nabsence of profit sharing compels a finding that no partnership\n\nexisted, see, e.g., Harrell Oil Co., 543 S.E.2d               at 525 (\"'[C]o-\n\nownership and sharing of any actual profits are indispensable\n\nrequisites for a partnership.'\") (citation omitted), it does not\n\nnecessarily follow that evidence of profit sharing compels a\n\nfinding of partnership formation.              See, e.g., Boeckmann, 909\n\nS.W.2d at 312 (\"[S]haring of profits alone does not make one a\n\npartner.\"); Holmes, 74 Cal. App. 4th at 454 & n.14 (\"[P]rofit\n\nsharing [is] evidence of a partnership, rather than a required\n\nelement of the definition of a partnership,\" and the UPA simply\n\nestablishes an \"evidentiary presumption.\"); Wilder, 398 S.E.2d\n\nat   627   (\"[S]haring    profits     does   not   of   itself   establish     a\n\npartnership.\").\n\n            Furthermore,       even   though   the      UPA   specifies     five\n\ninstances in which profit sharing does not create a presumption\n\nof partnership formation, see R.I. Gen. Laws § 7-12-18(4)(i)-\n\n\n                                      14\n\f(v), supra, Southex cites (and we have found) no authority for\n\nthe proposition that the evidentiary presumption created by\n\nprofit sharing can be overcome only by establishing these five\n\nexceptions, rather than by competent evidence of other pertinent\n\nfactors     indicating     the    absence     of     an    intent      to   form    a\n\npartnership      (e.g.,    lack    of    mutual      control     over       business\n\noperations, failure to file partnership tax returns, failure to\n\nprescribe    loss-sharing).        Thus,     the     undisputed       evidence     of\n\nprofit sharing did not compel a determination that Southex and\n\nRIBA formed a partnership.         Instead, the validity of the ruling\n\nbelow depends upon whether the district court correctly assessed\n\nthe totality of the circumstances.             See supra note 6.\n\n            Southex next urges that the 1974 Agreement necessitated\n\na finding of partnership formation, in that it unambiguously\n\ndescribes the contracting parties as \"partners.\"                    Consequently,\n\nSouthex   insists,       the   district      court    erred      by    considering\n\nextrinsic evidence regarding the meaning of the term \"partners,\"\n\nviz., by crediting testimony that RIBA and Southex's predecessor\n\ndid not intend, in 1974, to employ the term \"partners\" in its\n\nstrict legal sense, but merely in its colloquial sense, as a\n\n\"cooperative     joint    effort.\"       Further,      Southex        asserts   that\n\nbecause   RIBA    concededly      reviewed      the       1974   Agreement      with\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\fcounsel, we must presume that the term \"partners\" was employed\n\nin its strict legal sense.         Once again we must disagree.\n\n             First, the term \"partner\" frequently is defined with\n\na view to its context.         See Commonwealth v. Campbell, 616 N.E.2d\n\n430, 432 (Mass. 1993) (\"[T]he word 'partner' has also been known\n\nto describe other kinds of relationships, as diverse as husband\n\nand wife or two people who dance together.\").                  Yet, the present\n\nrecord contains no conclusive evidence as to whether the 1974\n\nAgreement was drafted by a layman or by an attorney.\n\n             More importantly, the labels the parties assign to\n\ntheir    intended      legal     relationship,       while       probative     of\n\npartnership formation, are not necessarily dispositive as a\n\nmatter of law, particularly in the presence of countervailing\n\nevidence     —     e.g.,   the    provision     in    the      1974   Agreement\n\nindemnifying RIBA for all show-related losses — which would tend\n\nto refute the partnership characterization.                    See Beckman, 579\n\nA.2d    at   627   (\"[A]lthough    the      manner   in   which    the   parties\n\nthemselves       characterize    the   relationship       is    probative,    the\n\nquestion     ultimately    is    objective      [intent].\");       Grimmett    v.\n\nHigginbotham, 907 S.W.2d 1, 2 n.3 (Tex. App. 1994) (\"There is\n\nsignificant authority that representations by the parties in\n\ndocuments or to third parties that a partnership relationship\n\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\fexists constitutes a legal conclusion and is not determinative\n\nof the relationship.\").\n\n              Although the courts should refrain from resorting to\n\nextrinsic evidence where a contract is utterly unambiguous, see\n\nFashion House, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 892 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st\n\nCir.       1989),   the   lone    reference     to     \"partners\"   in   the   1974\n\nAgreement's prefatory clause is so inconclusive as to carry\n\nminimal       interpretive       weight,     especially     since   it   arguably\n\nconflicted with other contract provisions. 7                   Had the parties\n\nintended otherwise, it would seem entirely reasonable to expect\n\nthe    1974     Agreement        to   have      been    entitled    \"Partnership\n\nAgreement,\" rather than simply \"Agreement.\"\n\n              Southex next contends that the district court erred by\n\nrelying upon Dagata's testimony, viz., that he may have intended\n\nto form a partnership in the production of the home shows, but\n\nnot in relation to the parties' joint use and ownership of the\n\nphysical property involved in conducting the business.                           As\n\n\n\n       7\n     The cases cited by Southex represent somewhat more\npersuasive authority for finding partnership formation, since\nthey did not simply involve a single reference to \"partners\" in\nthe written agreement. See, e.g., Plainview Milk Prods. Coop.\nv. Marron Foods, Inc., 3 F. Supp. 2d 1074, 1077 (D. Minn. 1998)\n(finding   partnership   formation   where   agreement   called\nrelationship a \"partnership\" and referred to \"partnership\nequipment,\" and where parties concededly made extracontractual\nreferences to their relationship, \"from time to time,\" as a\npartnership).\n\n                                           17\n\fSouthex sees it, this finding constituted legal error because\n\n(i)   the    law   recognizes        no    such   \"production-only\"     or   \"non-\n\nownership\"        partnership;       and     (ii)    the   undisputed    evidence\n\ndemonstrates that each contracting party contributed \"property\"\n\n(e.g., clientele, goodwill or expertise) to the partnership.\n\nThese contentions are immaterial.\n\n             First, it is unnecessary to determine whether Rhode\n\nIsland      law    would    recognize       a     \"production-only\"     or   \"non-\n\nownership\" partnership, because it is clear that the absence of\n\nany joint-property ownership is an entirely legitimate criterion\n\nfor determining that no cognizable partnership was ever formed.\n\nSee McAleer, 818 F. Supp. at 493; Harrell Oil Co., 543 S.E.2d at\n\n525 (\"'[C]o-ownership . . . [is] [an] indispensable requisite[]\n\nfor a partnership.'\") (citation omitted).                    Consequently, the\n\nreference to a \"production-only\" or \"non-ownership\" partnership\n\nis immaterial, since Dagata is not competent to opine on Rhode\n\nIsland partnership law.              Instead, the question is whether the\n\ndistrict court's determination — that the absence of any co-\n\nownership of property weighed against a finding of partnership\n\nformation — constituted clear error.                 It did not.\n\n             Southex       further    contends      that   the   district    court\n\nfinding that Dagata, \"a layman with no legal training,\" drafted\n\nthe 1974 Agreement, constituted reversible error because (i)\n\n\n                                           18\n\fthere is no evidence as to the identity of the drafter, and (ii)\n\nin any event, Dagata reviewed the 1974 Agreement with counsel.\n\nAssuming, arguendo, that the district court erred, the error was\n\nharmless.     See Moulton v. Rival Co., 116 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)   (\"'[T]he    standard   for    reviewing       a    district     court's\n\nnonconstitutional error in a civil suit requires that we find\n\nsuch error harmless if it is highly probable that the error did\n\nnot affect the outcome of the case.'\") (citation omitted).\n\n             The passing reference to Dagata's role as draftsman was\n\nbut one of several alternative grounds upon which the district\n\ncourt rejected Southex's contention that the reference in the\n\n1974 Agreement to \"partners\" was dispositive.                    The district\n\ncourt noted as well (i) that the term \"partners\" appeared \"only\n\nonce and only in the preamble of the agreement,\" (ii) the 1974\n\nAgreement was \"not labelled as a partnership agreement,\" (iii)\n\nthe   1974   Agreement   was   \"devoid    of   many       of   the   provisions\n\nordinarily found in [a] partnership agreement,\" including a\n\n\"provision for the distribution of assets upon termination [of\n\nthe partnership],\" and (iv) the 1974 Agreement contained other\n\nprovisions inconsistent with an intent to form a partnership,\n\nsuch as its limited five-year term, SEM's full indemnification\n\n\n\n\n                                     19\n\fof RIBA, and SEM's commitment to advance all expenditures for\n\nthe shows.8\n\n          Further,   the   district   court   identified   extrinsic\n\nevidence that Manual Sherman disclaimed any ownership interest\n\nin the shows, that Southex never asked RIBA in 1994 whether\n\nSouthex was acquiring a partnership interest, and that Southex\n\nhad entered into related third-party contracts in its name\n\nalone,   rather   than   any   partnership    name.   Given   these\n\nalternative holdings, we are unable to conclude that there\n\nexisted the requisite \"high probability\" that any misperception\n\nregarding Dagata's draftsmanship affected the outcome below.\n\n\n\n    8 Southex contests various evidentiary rulings as well. For\ninstance, it argues that the district court admitted hearsay\ntestimony, by Ross Dagata, that Manual Sherman expressly\ndisclaimed any ownership interest in the shows. RIBA counters\nthat the Dagata testimony came within an exception to the\nhearsay rule, since Dagata testified as to Manual Sherman's\nstate of mind or intent in signing a contract which contained\nthe word \"partners.\"    See Fed. R. Evid. 803(3).     In reply,\nrather than explaining why Rule 803(3) is inapposite, Southex\nmerely contends that RIBA adduced no evidence that Manual\nSherman made this remark at or about the time he executed the\n1974 Agreement.\n     We review rulings under Evidence Rule 803(3) only for abuse\nof discretion. See Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am., 100\nF.3d 203, 212-13 (1st Cir. 1996). The district court acted well\nwithin its discretion in finding that Manual Sherman, a\nsophisticated businessman, likely would have made his statement\nto Dagata, regarding his understanding of a contract, before he\nexecuted the contract.    Indeed, Dagata testified that Manual\nSherman stated that \"[h]e wanted no ownership of the show . . .\n. [a]nd . . . we came to an agreement.\" The other evidentiary\nchallenges asserted by Southex are unfounded as well.\n\n                                 20\n\f          Finally, Southex suggests that the district court erred\n\nin   rejecting   its   partnership-by-estoppel   claim.     Southex\n\ncontended that even if the 1974 Agreement itself established no\n\ncognizable partnership, RIBA had the legal duty to so inform\n\nSouthex in 1994, at the time Southex acquired its rights under\n\nthe 1974 Agreement, and that RIBA's failure to do so estops it\n\nfrom denying partnership formation now.\n\n          We review equitable estoppel rulings under a bifurcated\n\nstandard, assessing legal conclusions de novo and findings of\n\nfact for clear error only.      See Ludlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc. v.\n\nSec'y of Health and Human Servs., 124 F.3d 22, 25 n.6 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).   Southex had the burden to prove:     \"'[1] an affirmative\n\nrepresentation or equivalent conduct on the part of the person\n\nagainst whom the estoppel is claimed [viz., RIBA] which is\n\ndirected to another [viz., Southex] for the purpose of inducing\n\nthe other to act or fail to act in reliance thereon; and . . .\n\n[2] that such representation or conduct in fact did induce the\n\nother to act or fail to act to his injury.'\"              Providence\n\nTeachers Union v. Providence Sch. Bd., 689 A.2d 388, 391-92\n\n(R.I. 1997) (citation omitted).       \"Silence [also] . . . can be\n\nthe basis for estoppel where there exists a duty not to remain\n\nsilent as where the circumstances require one to speak lest such\n\nsilence would reasonably mislead another to rely thereon to his\n\n\n                                 21\n\fdetriment.\"     Schiavulli v. Sch. Comm. of Town of N. Providence,\n\n334 A.2d 416, 419 (R.I. 1975).\n\n           On    the    other   hand,   equitable   estoppel    is\n\n\"extraordinary\" relief, which \"will not be applied unless the\n\nequities clearly [are] balanced in favor of the part[y] seeking\n\nrelief.\"   Greenwich Bay Yacht Basin Assocs. v. Brown, 537 A.2d\n\n988, 991 (R.I. 1988) (emphasis added).9    As the party asserting\n\n\n    9To the extent Southex based its estoppel claim on the Rhode\nIsland statute, it is more than arguable that the UPA estoppel\nprovision simply creates rights of action against partners by\nthird parties (i.e., non-partners), rather than rights inter se\nalleged co-partners such as Southex.      See, e.g., Vergos v.\nWaterman Bldg. P'ship, 613 So.2d 383, 389 (Ala. 1993).       The\nRhode Island partnership statute provides, in pertinent part:\n\n           When a person, by words spoken or written or\n           by conduct, represents him or herself, or\n           consents to another representing him or her\n           to any one, as a partner in an existing\n           partnership or with one or more persons not\n           actual partners, he or she is liable to any\n           person to whom the representation has been\n           made, who has, on the faith of the\n           representation, given credit to the actual\n           or apparent partnership, and if he or she\n           has made a representation or consented to\n           its being made in a public manner he or she\n           is liable to the person, whether the\n           representation has or has not been made or\n           communicated to the person giving credit by\n           or with the knowledge of the apparent\n           partner   making   the   representation   or\n           consenting to its being made.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 7-12-27. On the other hand, it is arguable as\nwell that putative co-partners may still invoke the common-law\ndoctrine of equitable estoppel. See Vergos, 613 So.2d at 389.\nWe therefore assume, arguendo, that the Rhode Island courts\n\n                                 22\n\fthe equitable estoppel claim, Southex bore the ultimate burden\n\nof proof.    See Steinke v. Sungard Fin. Sys., Inc., 121 F.3d 763,\n\n776 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            A finding of fact is not to be disturbed under the\n\nclear error standard of review unless \"we are firmly convinced,\"\n\nafter reviewing all the evidence, \"that a mistake has been\n\nmade.\"   Tokyo Marine, 142 F.3d at 11.             Southex identifies three\n\npieces of evidence which purportedly created an affirmative duty\n\non the part of RIBA to inform Southex, in 1994, that Southex was\n\nnot acquiring a partnership interest; viz. (i) the reference to\n\n\"partners\" in the 1974 Agreement; (ii) the statements Dagata\n\nmade to the local press that Reed Exhibitions had \" sold its home\n\nshows to Southex,\" supra note 1; and (iii) an article, in a 1994\n\nRIBA trade publication, entitled:            \"Southex Exhibitions acquires\n\nHome Show,\" id.\n\n            Based    on   the    trial      record,     the   district   court\n\nreasonably could have found the following facts.               Since the 1974\n\nAgreement    is     ambiguous,    in        that   it   included   no    clear\n\nrepresentation by RIBA that it regarded its relationship with\n\nSEM as a partnership, both RIBA and Southex were placed on fair\n\nnotice to inquire into the nature of their relationship.                  Yet,\n\nat no time during the pre-transfer discussions between the\n\n\npermit such a cause of action.\n\n                                       23\n\fSouthex and RIBA representatives did either party raise the\n\nissue regarding whether Southex was to acquire ownership rights\n\nin the RIBA shows.           Furthermore, RIBA merely consented to the\n\n1994        agreement   between     Reed    and   Southex,      whereby   Reed\n\ntransferred its rights under the 1974 Agreement, which consent\n\nneither necessitated nor implied any viewpoint on the part of\n\nRIBA regarding the nature of the contractual rights thereby\n\ntransferred.10       The pertinent transfer occurred between Southex\n\nand Reed.       Southex neither established that it did not rely on\n\nReed's representations, nor that but for RIBA's silence it would\n\nnot have acquired the rights to produce either the RIBA shows or\n\nthe two other shows it simultaneously purchased from Reed along\n\nwith the RIBA contract.\n\n               Finally, like the 1974 Agreement itself, the two post-\n\nconsent       statements     RIBA   made    to    the   press    —   allegedly\n\nproclaiming Reed's ownership rights in the RIBA shows — were\n\ninternally contradictory as well as ambiguous, and, if anything,\n\nshould       have   placed   Southex   on   \"additional   inquiry\"     notice.\n\n\n\n       10\n      Southex insists that its request that RIBA consent to the\nReed-Southex transfer, together with the fact that RIBA's\nconsent mentions the 1974 Agreement, \"clearly\" establish\nSouthex's reliance.    We cannot agree that such a request,\nreasonably asserted by parties attempting to assign a personal-\nservices-type contract, necessarily implied a further request\nfor RIBA's opinion regarding the nature of the contractual\nrights transferred. Simply put, Southex sought no such opinion.\n\n                                       24\n\fWhile employing ambiguous terms, such as \"sold\" and \"acquires,\"\n\nwhich reasonably could portend either a transfer of partnership\n\nor   nonpartnership      rights,       RIBA   described       Southex   as    the\n\n\"producer\"    of   the   RIBA    shows.       Thus,     the     district     court\n\npermissibly    determined       that    Southex   did     not    exercise      due\n\ndiligence in ascertaining and/or clarifying the terms of the\n\n1974 Agreement which it was about to assume, and, consequently,\n\nthat the equities did not clearly weigh in its favor.                          See\n\nGreenwich Bay Yacht, 537 A.2d at 991.\n\n          Accordingly, the district court judgment is affirmed;\n\ncosts are assessed against appellant.

(\"Southex\") challenges a district court bench ruling that no partnership existed between Southex and the Rhode Island Builder's Association, Inc. (\"RIBA\"), even though Southex's predecessors in interest had produced home shows for RIBA in Rhode Island ever since 1974. We affirm the district court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1974, with the construction of the new Providence Civic Center (\"Civic Center\") and the expansion in RIBA home shows, RIBA's executive director, Ross Dagata, decided to enter into an agreement with Sherman Exposition Management, Inc. (\"SEM\"), a Massachusetts-based professional show owner and producer, for future productions of the RIBA home shows at the Civic Center (\"the 1974 Agreement\"). The preamble in the 1974 Agreement announced that \"RIBA wishes to participate in such [s]hows as sponsors and <i>partners.</i>...\" (Emphasis added.) The term of the 1974 Agreement was fixed at five years, renewable by mutual agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIBA further agreed (i) to sponsor and endorse only shows produced by SEM, (ii) to persuade RIBA members to exhibit at those shows, and (iii) to permit SEM to use RIBA's name for promotional purposes. In turn, SEM undertook, <i>inter alia,</i> to (i) obtain all necessary leases, licenses, permits and insurance, (ii) indemnify RIBA for show-related losses \"of whatever sort,\" (iii) accord RIBA the right to accept or reject any exhibitor, (iv) audit show income, and (v) advance all the capital required to finance the shows. Net show profits were to be shared: 55% to SEM; 45% to RIBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1974 Agreement further provided that all show dates and admission prices, as well as the Rhode Island banking institution at which show-related business would be transacted, were to be mutually determined by the parties. In the event the Civic Center were to become unavailable for reasons beyond SEM's control, SEM was to be excused from its production duties, provided that SEM promoted no other home show in Rhode Island during the interim; and RIBA retained the right to conduct a home show at another venue, upon appropriate notification to SEM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contemporaneous conversations relating to the meaning of the term \"partners,\" Manual Sherman, SEM's president, informed RIBA's Ross Dagata that he \"wanted no ownership of the show,\" because he was uncertain about the financial prospects for home shows in the Rhode Island market. Manual Sherman advised Dagata: \"[A]fter the first year, if I'm not happy, we can't produce the show properly or make any money, we'll give you back the show.\" Although SEM owned other home shows which it produced outside Rhode Island, Manual Sherman consistently described himself simply as the \"producer\" of the RIBA shows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, following a series of assignments and contract renewals agreed to by RIBA, Southex acquired SEM'S interest under the 1974 Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> By 1998, Southex determined that in order to maintain its financial stake in the RIBA home shows, the 1974 Agreement either needed to be renegotiated or allowed to expire according to its terms in 1999. RIBA in turn expressed dissatisfaction with Southex's performance, and eventually entered into a management contract with another producer, Yoffee Exposition Services, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Southex commenced suit against RIBA in federal district court, to enjoin the RIBA 2000 home show, alleging that the 1974 Agreement established a partnership between RIBA and Southex's predecessor-in-interest (<i>i.e.,</i> SEM), and/or that by its silence RIBA had enabled the formation of a partnership-by-estoppel, and that RIBA breached its fiduciary duties to its co-partner, Southex, by its wrongful dissolution of their partnership and its subsequent appointment of another producer. Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the preliminary injunction requested by Southex, finding no likelihood of ultimate success on the merits. We affirmed in an unpublished opinion. <i>See Southex Exhibitions, Inc. v. R.I. Builders Ass'n,</i> No. 00-1247, slip op. at 2, 2000 WL 252889 (1st Cir. Mar. 2, 2000) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the bench trial following our remand, the district court entertained further evidence, then entered judgment for RIBA on the ground that the 1974 Agreement established no partnership under Rhode Island law, and that Southex had adduced insufficient evidence to support its partnership-by-estoppel claim. In due course, Southex brought the instant appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rhode Island law, a \"partnership\" is \"an association of two (2) or more persons to carry on <i>as co-owners</i> a business for profit....\" R.I.

Narragansett Indian Tribe,</i> 19 F.3d 685, 691 (1st Cir.1994), the determination as to whether a partnership was formed turned primarily on factual findings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> which we review only for clear error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> A finding of fact constitutes clear error only if, after reviewing the entire trial record, \"we are <i>firmly convinced</i> that a mistake has been made.\" <i>See Tokyo Marine &amp; Fire Ins. Co. v. Perez &amp; Cia, De Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> 142 F.3d 1, 11 (1st Cir.1998) (emphasis added). As the party asserting that a partnership was formed, the ultimate burden of persuasion rested upon Southex.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Southex insists that the 1974 Agreement contains ample indicia that a partnership was formed, including: (1) a 55-45% sharing of profits; (2) mutual control over designated business operations, such as show dates, admission prices, choice of exhibitors, and \"partnership\" bank accounts; and (3) the respective contributions of valuable property to the partnership by the partners. Given the highly deferential standard of appellate review, however, Southex must do more than point to supportive record evidence. Since it bears the burden of proof, it must demonstrate that the district court ruling, viewed in the light most favorable to RIBA, is not <i>rationally</i> supported by the record evidence. <i>See Damon v. Sun. Co.,</i> 87 F.3d 1467, 1477 (1st Cir.1996). In our view, the record evidence indicating a nonpartner relationship cannot be dismissed as insubstantial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the 1974 Agreement is simply entitled \"Agreement,\" rather than \"Partnership Agreement.\" Second, rather than an agreement for an indefinite duration, it prescribed a fixed (albeit renewable) term. Third, rather than undertake to share operating costs with RIBA, SEM not only agreed to advance <i>all</i> monies required to produce the shows, but to indemnify RIBA for <i>all</i> show-related <i>losses</i> as well. State law normally presumes that partners share equally or at least proportionately in partnership losses. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 7-12-26(a), 7-12-29(1) &amp; (2). Although partners may agree to override such statutory \"default\" provisions, there is no evidence that SEM and RIBA meant to do so notwithstanding an intent to form a partnership. <i>See</i> 1 Alan R. Bromberg &amp; Larry E. Ribstein, <i>Bromberg and Ribstein on Property</i> &#167; 2.07(d) (1999) (identifying \"loss sharing\" as very important partnership attribute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, although RIBA involved itself in some management decisions, SEM was responsible for the lion's share. <i>Cf.</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 7-12-29(5) (noting default rule that partners normally share \"equal rights in management\"). Furthermore, Southex not only entered into contracts but conducted business with third parties, in its own name, rather than in the name of the putative partnership. As a matter of fact, their mutual association was never given a name. It is noteworthy as well that Southex stipulated at trial that it never filed either a federal or state partnership tax return. <i>See Cochran v. Bd. of Supervisors of Del Norte County,</i> 85 Cal.App.3d 75, 82, 149 Cal.Rptr. 304 (1978) (failure to file partnership tax return probative of nonpartner relationship); <i>Wilder v. Hobson,</i> 101 N.C.App. 199, 398 S.E.2d 625, 627 (1990) (\"Filing a partnership tax return is significant evidence of a partnership.\"); <i>Widdoss v. Donahue,</i> 331 N.W.2d 831, 833 (S.D.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the evidence as to whether either SEM or RIBA contributed any corporate property, with the intent that it become jointly-owned partnership property is highly speculative, particularly since their mutual endeavor simply involved a periodic event, <i>i.e.,</i> an annual home show, which neither generated, nor necessitated, ownership interests in significant tangible properties, aside from cash receipts. Unlike tangible real and personal property, whose ownership is more readily established (<i>e.g.,</i> by documentary evidence and public records), <i>see, e.g., Harrell Oil Co. of Mt. Airy v. Case,</i> 142 N.C.App. 485, 543 S.E.2d 522, 525 (2001) (finding \"overwhelming\" evidence of ownership in \"building, the property, the inventory, and the equipment\"), the intangible intellectual property involved here, such as clientele lists, goodwill, and business expertise, did not so readily lend itself to evidentiary establishment. As a consequence, in the present circumstances the requisite mutual intent to convert intangible intellectual properties into partnership assets may well depend much more importantly upon a clear contractual expression of mutual intention to form a partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even assuming that the 1974 Agreement, as a whole, is ambiguous, (i) Manuel Sherman testified that he regarded SEM as simply the producer of the annual RIBA shows; and (ii) Dagata testified that SEM specifically disclaimed any ownership interest in the home shows in 1974. <i>See Boeckmann v. Mitchell,</i> 322 Ark. 198, 909 S.W.2d 308, 312 (1995) (where testimony relates to partnership formation, appellate court must defer to trial court as primary arbiter of witness credibility).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Southex asserts that the district court committed reversible error by not crediting undisputed evidence that RIBA, in 1974, expressly agreed to share business profits with SEM. Southex reasons that since the Rhode Island partnership statute makes such profit sharing <i>prima facie</i> evidence of partnership formation, and RIBA failed to rebut that evidentiary presumption by establishing any of the five exceptions specified in subsection 7-12-18(4), the district court was <i>required</i> to find, as a matter of law, that a partnership was formed. Its reasoning is flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Partnership\" is a notoriously imprecise term, whose definition is especially elusive in practice. <i>See Boeckmann,</i> 909 S.W.2d at 312 (\"[T]he term `partnership' is not easily elucidated [and] ... [t]he business association that is known in the law as partnership is not one that can be defined with precision. To the contrary, a partnership is a contractual relationship that may vary, in form and substance, in an almost infinite variety of ways.\") (citation omitted). Since a partnership can be created absent any written formalities whatsoever, its existence <i>vel non</i> normally must be assessed under a \"totality-of-the-circumstances\" test.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the courts frequently consider indicia of partnership formation not prescribed in the UPA, such as the extent to which the putative partners respectively exercised control over the entity's business operations, <i>see, e.g., McAleer v. Smith,</i> 818 F.Supp. 486, 493 (D.R.I. 1993), <i>aff'd,</i> 57 F.3d 109 (1st Cir.1995), or whether the entity filed partnership tax returns, <i>see, e.g., Wilder,</i> 398 S.E.2d at 628. Yet, though these considerations constitute \"necessary guidepoints of inquiry,... none is conclusive.\" <i>Beckman v. Farmer,</i> 579 A.2d 618, 627 (D.C.1990); <i>see Holmes v. Lerner,</i> 74 Cal.App.4th 442, 454, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 130 (1999) (\"[T]he presence or absence of any of the various elements set forth in [the UPA] ... is not necessarily dispositive.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, even though the UPA explicitly identifies profit sharing as a particularly probative indicium of partnership formation, and some courts have even held that the absence of profit sharing compels a finding that no partnership existed, <i>see, e.g., Harrell Oil Co.,</i> 543 S.E.2d at 525 (\"`[C]o-ownership and sharing of any actual profits are indispensable requisites for a partnership.'\") (citation omitted), it does not necessarily follow that evidence of profit sharing compels a finding of partnership formation. <i>See, e.g., Boeckmann,</i> 909 S.W.2d at 312 (\"[S]haring of profits alone does not make one a partner.\"); <i>Holmes,</i> 74 Cal.App.4th at 454 &amp; n. 14, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 130 (\"[P]rofit sharing [is] evidence of a partnership, rather than a required element of the definition of a partnership,\" and the UPA simply establishes an \"evidentiary presumption.\"); <i>Wilder,</i> 398 S.E.2d at 627 (\"[S]haring profits does not of itself establish a partnership.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even though the UPA specifies five instances in which profit sharing does not create a presumption of partnership formation, <i>see</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 7-12-18(4)(i)-(v), <i>supra,</i> Southex cites (and we have found) no authority for the proposition that the evidentiary presumption created by profit sharing can be overcome <i>only</i> by establishing these five exceptions, rather than by competent evidence of other pertinent factors indicating the absence of an intent to form a partnership (<i>e.g.,</i> lack of mutual control over business operations, failure to file partnership tax returns, failure to prescribe loss-sharing). Thus, the undisputed evidence of profit sharing did not compel a determination that Southex and RIBA formed a partnership. Instead, the validity of the ruling below depends upon whether the district court correctly assessed the totality of the circumstances. <i>See supra</i> note 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Southex next urges that the 1974 Agreement necessitated a finding of partnership formation, in that it unambiguously describes the contracting parties as \"partners.\" Consequently, Southex insists, the district court erred by considering extrinsic evidence regarding the meaning of the term \"partners,\" <i>viz.,</i> by crediting testimony that RIBA and Southex's predecessor did not intend, in 1974, to employ the term \"partners\" in its strict legal sense, but merely in its colloquial sense, as a \"cooperative joint effort.\" Further, Southex asserts that because RIBA concededly reviewed the 1974 Agreement with counsel, we must presume that the term \"partners\" was employed in its strict legal sense. Once again we must disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the term \"partner\" frequently is defined with a view to its context. <i>See</i> <i>Commonwealth v. Campbell,</i> 415 Mass. 697, 616 N.E.2d 430, 432 (1993) (\"[T]he word `partner' has also been known to describe other kinds of relationships, as diverse as husband and wife or two people who dance together.\"). Yet, the present record contains no conclusive evidence as to whether the 1974 Agreement was drafted by a layman or by an attorney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the labels the parties assign to their intended legal relationship, while probative of partnership formation, are not necessarily dispositive as a matter of law, particularly in the presence of countervailing evidence &#8212; <i>e.g.,</i> the provision in the 1974 Agreement indemnifying RIBA for all show-related losses &#8212; which would tend to refute the partnership characterization. <i>See Beckman,</i> 579 A.2d at 627 (\"[A]lthough the manner in which the parties themselves characterize the relationship is probative, the question ultimately is objective [intent].\"); <i>Grimmett v. Higginbotham,</i> 907 S.W.2d 1, 2 n. 3 (Tex.App.1994) (\"There is significant authority that representations by the parties in documents or to third parties that a partnership relationship exists constitutes a legal conclusion and is not determinative of the relationship.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the courts should refrain from resorting to extrinsic evidence where a contract is utterly unambiguous, <i>see Fashion House, Inc. v. K mart Corp.,</i> 892 F.2d 1076, 1083 (1st Cir.1989), the lone reference to \"partners\" in the 1974 Agreement's prefatory clause is so inconclusive as to carry minimal interpretive weight, especially since it arguably conflicted with other contract provisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Had the parties intended otherwise, it would seem entirely reasonable to expect the 1974 Agreement to have been entitled \"Partnership Agreement,\" rather than simply \"Agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Southex next contends that the district court erred by relying upon Dagata's testimony, <i>viz.,</i> that he may have intended to form a partnership in the <i>production</i> of the home shows, but not in relation to the parties' joint use and ownership of the physical property involved in conducting the business. As Southex sees it, this finding constituted legal error because (i) the law recognizes no such \"production-only\" or \"non-ownership\" partnership; and (ii) the undisputed evidence demonstrates that each contracting party contributed \"property\" (<i>e.g.,</i> clientele, goodwill or expertise) to the partnership. These contentions are immaterial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is unnecessary to determine whether Rhode Island law would recognize a \"production-only\" or \"non-ownership\" partnership, because it is clear that the <i>absence of any joint-property ownership</i> is an entirely legitimate criterion for determining that no cognizable partnership was ever formed. <i>See McAleer,</i> 818 F.Supp. at 493; <i>Harrell Oil Co.,</i> 543 S.E.2d at 525 (\"`[C]o-ownership ... [is][an] indispensable requisite[ ] for a partnership.'\") (citation omitted). Consequently, the reference to a \"production-only\" or \"non-ownership\" partnership is immaterial, since Dagata is not competent to opine on Rhode Island partnership law. Instead, the question is whether the district court's determination &#8212; that the absence of any co-ownership of property weighed against a finding of partnership formation &#8212; constituted clear error. It did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Southex further contends that the district court finding that Dagata, \"a layman with no legal training,\" drafted the 1974 Agreement, constituted reversible error because (i) there is no evidence as to the identity of the drafter, and (ii) in any event, Dagata reviewed the 1974 Agreement with counsel. Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the district court erred, the error was harmless. <i>See Moulton v. Rival Co.,</i> 116 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1997) (\"`[T]he standard for reviewing a district court's nonconstitutional error in a civil suit requires that we find such error harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not affect the outcome of the case.'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The passing reference to Dagata's role as draftsman was but one of several alternative grounds upon which the district court rejected Southex's contention that the reference in the 1974 Agreement to \"partners\" was dispositive. The district court noted as well (i) that the term \"partners\" appeared \"only once and only in the preamble of the agreement,\" (ii) the 1974 Agreement was \"not labelled as a partnership agreement,\" (iii) the 1974 Agreement was \"devoid of many of the provisions ordinarily found in [a] partnership agreement,\" including a \"provision for the distribution of assets upon termination [of the partnership],\" and (iv) the 1974 Agreement contained other provisions inconsistent with an intent to form a partnership, such as its limited five-year term, SEM's full indemnification of RIBA, and SEM's commitment to advance all expenditures for the shows.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the district court identified extrinsic evidence that Manual Sherman disclaimed any ownership interest in the shows, that Southex never asked RIBA in 1994 whether Southex was acquiring a partnership interest, and that Southex had entered into related third-party contracts in its name alone, rather than any partnership name. Given these alternative holdings, we are unable to conclude that there existed the requisite \"high probability\" that any misperception regarding Dagata's draftsmanship affected the outcome below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Southex suggests that the district court erred in rejecting its partnership-by-estoppel claim. Southex contended that even if the 1974 Agreement itself established no cognizable partnership, RIBA had the legal duty to so inform Southex <i>in 1994,</i> at the time Southex acquired its rights under the 1974 Agreement, and that RIBA's failure to do so estops it from denying partnership formation now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review equitable estoppel rulings under a bifurcated standard, assessing legal conclusions <i>de novo</i> and findings of fact for clear error only. <i>See In re Ludlow Hosp. Soc'y, Inc.,</i> 124 F.3d 22, 25 n. 6 (1st Cir.1997). Southex had the burden to prove: \"`[1] an affirmative representation or equivalent conduct on the part of the person against whom the estoppel is claimed [<i>viz.,</i> RIBA] which is directed to another [<i>viz.,</i> Southex] for the purpose of inducing the other to act or fail to act in reliance thereon; and ... [2] that such representation or conduct in fact did induce the other to act or fail to act to his injury.'\" <i>Providence Teachers Union v. Providence Sch. Bd.,</i> 689 A.2d 388, 391-92 (R.I.1997) (citation omitted). \"Silence [also] ... can be the basis for estoppel where there exists a duty not to remain silent as where the circumstances require one to speak lest such silence would reasonably mislead another to rely thereon to his detriment.\" <i>Schiavulli v.

Brown,</i> 537 A.2d 988, 991 (R.I.1988) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> As the party asserting the equitable estoppel claim, Southex bore the ultimate burden of proof. <i>See Steinke v. Sungard Fin. Sys., Inc.,</i> 121 F.3d 763, 776 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A finding of fact is not to be disturbed under the clear error standard of review unless \"we are firmly convinced,\" after reviewing all the evidence, \"that a mistake has been made.\" <i>Tokyo Marine,</i> 142 F.3d at 11. Southex identifies three pieces of evidence which purportedly created an affirmative duty on the part of RIBA to inform Southex, in 1994, that Southex was not acquiring a partnership interest; <i>viz.</i> (i) the reference to \"partners\" in the 1974 Agreement; (ii) the statements Dagata made to the local press that Reed Exhibitions had \"<i>sold</i> its home shows to Southex,\" <i>supra</i> note 1; and (iii) an article, in a 1994 RIBA trade publication, entitled: \"Southex Exhibitions <i>acquires</i> Home Show,\" <i>id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the trial record, the district court reasonably could have found the following facts. Since the 1974 Agreement is ambiguous, in that it included no clear representation by RIBA that it regarded its relationship with SEM as a partnership, <i>both</i> RIBA and Southex were placed on fair notice to inquire into the nature of their relationship. Yet, at no time during the pre-transfer discussions between the Southex and RIBA representatives did either party raise the issue regarding whether Southex was to acquire ownership rights in the RIBA shows. Furthermore, RIBA merely consented to the 1994 agreement between Reed and Southex, whereby Reed transferred its rights under the 1974 Agreement, which consent neither necessitated nor implied any viewpoint on the part of RIBA regarding the nature of the contractual rights thereby transferred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The pertinent transfer occurred between Southex <i>and Reed.</i> Southex neither established that it did not rely on <i>Reed</i>'s representations, nor that but for RIBA's silence it would not have acquired the rights to produce either the RIBA shows or the two other shows it simultaneously purchased from Reed along with the RIBA contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, like the 1974 Agreement itself, the two <i>post-consent</i> statements RIBA made to the press &#8212; allegedly proclaiming Reed's ownership rights in the RIBA shows &#8212; were internally contradictory as well as ambiguous, and, if anything, should have placed Southex on \"additional inquiry\" notice. While employing ambiguous terms, such as \"sold\" and \"acquires,\" which reasonably could portend <i>either</i> a transfer of partnership <i>or</i> nonpartnership rights, RIBA described Southex as the \"producer\" of the RIBA shows. Thus, the district court permissibly determined that Southex did not exercise due diligence in ascertaining and/or clarifying the terms of the 1974 Agreement which it was about to assume, and, consequently, that the equities did not clearly weigh in its favor. <i>See Greenwich Bay Yacht,</i> 537 A.2d at 991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Accordingly, the district court judgment is affirmed; costs are assessed against appellant.</i> <i>SO ORDERED.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> With regard to the acquisition by Southex, RIBA's Dagata inartfully advised the Providence Journal that Reed Exhibitions, SEM's successor-in-interest, had \"<i>sold</i> its home shows to Southex.\" One month later, an article appeared in an RIBA trade publication entitled: \"Southex Exhibitions <i>acquires</i> Home Show.\" (Emphasis added.)

Marron Foods, Inc.,</i> 3 F.Supp.2d 1074, 1077 (D.Minn.1998) (finding partnership formation where agreement called relationship a \"partnership\" and referred to \"partnership equipment,\" and where parties concededly made extracontractual references to their relationship, \"from time to time,\" as a partnership).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Southex contests various evidentiary rulings as well. For instance, it argues that the district court admitted hearsay testimony, by Ross Dagata, that Manual Sherman expressly disclaimed any ownership interest in the shows. RIBA counters that the Dagata testimony came within an exception to the hearsay rule, since Dagata testified as to Manual Sherman's state of mind or intent in signing a contract which contained the word \"partners.\"<i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 803(3). In reply, rather than explaining why Rule 803(3) is inapposite, Southex merely contends that RIBA adduced no evidence that Manual Sherman made this remark at or about the time he executed the 1974 Agreement.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We review rulings under Evidence Rule 803(3) only for abuse of discretion. <i>See Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,</i> 100 F.3d 203, 212-13 (1st Cir.1996). The district court acted well within its discretion in finding that Manual Sherman, a sophisticated businessman, likely would have made his statement to Dagata, regarding his understanding of a contract, <i>before</i> he executed the contract. Indeed, Dagata testified that Manual Sherman stated that \"[h]e wanted no ownership of the show.... [a]nd ... we came to an agreement.\" The other evidentiary challenges asserted by Southex are unfounded as well.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> To the extent Southex based its estoppel claim on the Rhode Island statute, it is more than arguable that the UPA estoppel provision simply creates rights of action against partners<i>by third parties</i> (<i>i.e., non-partners</i>), rather than rights <i>inter se</i> alleged co-partners such as Southex. <i>See, e.g., Vergos v. Waterman Bldg. P'ship,</i> 613 So.2d 383, 389 (Ala.1993). The Rhode Island partnership statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">When a person, by words spoken or written or by conduct, represents him or herself, or consents to another representing him or her to any one, as a partner in an existing partnership or with one or more persons not actual partners, he or she is liable to any person to whom the representation has been made, who has, on the faith of the representation, given credit to the actual or apparent partnership, and if he or she has made a representation or consented to its being made in a public manner he or she is liable to the person, whether the representation has or has not been made or communicated to the person giving credit by or with the knowledge of the apparent partner making the representation or consenting to its being made.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 7-12-27. On the other hand, it is arguable as well that putative co-partners may still invoke the <i>common-law</i> doctrine of equitable estoppel. <i>See Vergos,</i> 613 So.2d at 389. We therefore assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that the Rhode Island courts permit such a cause of action.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Southex insists that its request that RIBA consent to the Reed-Southex transfer, together with the fact that RIBA's consent mentions the 1974 Agreement, \"clearly\" establish Southex's reliance. We cannot agree that such a request, reasonably asserted by parties attempting to assign a personal-services-type contract, necessarily implied a further request for RIBA's opinion regarding the nature of the contractual rights transferred.

We affirm the district court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">* <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1974, with the construction of the new Providence Civic Center (\"Civic Center\") and the expansion in RIBA home shows, RIBA's executive director, Ross Dagata, decided to enter into an agreement with Sherman Exposition Management, Inc. (\"SEM\"), a Massachusetts-based professional show owner and producer, for future productions of the RIBA home shows at the Civic Center (\"the 1974 Agreement\"). The preamble in the 1974 Agreement announced that \"RIBA wishes to participate in such [s]hows as sponsors and <i>partners.</i>...\" (Emphasis added.) The term of the 1974 Agreement was fixed at five years, renewable by mutual agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RIBA further agreed (i) to sponsor and endorse only shows produced by SEM, (ii) to persuade RIBA members to exhibit at those shows, and (iii) to permit SEM to use RIBA's name for promotional purposes. In turn, SEM undertook, <i>inter alia,</i> to (i) obtain all necessary leases, licenses, permits and insurance, (ii) indemnify RIBA for show-related losses \"of whatever sort,\" (iii) accord RIBA the right to accept or reject any exhibitor, (iv) audit show income, and (v) advance all the capital required to finance the shows. Net show profits were to be shared: 55% to SEM; 45% to RIBA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1974 Agreement further provided that all show dates and admission prices, as well as the Rhode Island banking institution at which show-related business would be transacted, were to be mutually determined by the parties. In the event the Civic Center were to become unavailable for reasons beyond SEM's control, SEM was to be excused from its production duties, provided that SEM promoted no other home show in Rhode Island during the interim; and RIBA retained the right to conduct a home show at another venue, upon appropriate notification to SEM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contemporaneous conversations relating to the meaning of the term \"partners,\" Manual Sherman, SEM's president, informed RIBA's Ross Dagata that he \"wanted no ownership of the show,\" because he was uncertain about the financial prospects for home shows in the Rhode Island market. Manual Sherman advised Dagata: \"[A]fter the first year, if I'm not happy, we can't produce the show properly or make any money, we'll give you back the show.\" Although SEM owned other home shows which it produced outside Rhode Island, Manual Sherman consistently described himself simply as the \"producer\" of the RIBA shows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, following a series of assignments and contract renewals agreed to by RIBA, Southex acquired SEM'S interest under the 1974 Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> By 1998, Southex determined that in order to maintain its financial stake in the RIBA home shows, the 1974 Agreement either needed to be renegotiated or allowed to expire according to its terms in 1999. RIBA in turn expressed dissatisfaction with Southex's performance, and eventually entered into a management contract with another producer, Yoffee Exposition Services, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Southex commenced suit against RIBA in federal district court, to enjoin the RIBA 2000 home show, alleging that the 1974 Agreement established a partnership between RIBA and Southex's predecessor-in-interest (<i>i.e.,</i> SEM), and/or that by its silence RIBA had enabled the formation of a partnership-by-estoppel, and that RIBA breached its fiduciary duties to its co-partner, Southex, by its wrongful dissolution of their partnership and its subsequent appointment of another producer. Following an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied the preliminary injunction requested by Southex, finding no likelihood of ultimate success on the merits. We affirmed in an unpublished opinion. <i>See Southex Exhibitions, Inc. v. R.I.

Given the highly deferential standard of appellate review, however, Southex must do more than point to supportive record evidence. Since it bears the burden of proof, it must demonstrate that the district court ruling, viewed in the light most favorable to RIBA, is not <i>rationally</i> supported by the record evidence. <i>See Damon v.

Third, rather than undertake to share operating costs with RIBA, SEM not only agreed to advance <i>all</i> monies required to produce the shows, but to indemnify RIBA for <i>all</i> show-related <i>losses</i> as well. State law normally presumes that partners share equally or at least proportionately in partnership losses. <i>See</i> R.I. Gen. Laws &#167;&#167; 7-12-26(a), 7-12-29(1) &amp; (2). Although partners may agree to override such statutory \"default\" provisions, there is no evidence that SEM and RIBA meant to do so notwithstanding an intent to form a partnership. <i>See</i> 1 Alan R. Bromberg &amp; Larry E.

Gen. Laws &#167; 7-12-29(5) (noting default rule that partners normally share \"equal rights in management\"). Furthermore, Southex not only entered into contracts but conducted business with third parties, in its own name, rather than in the name of the putative partnership. As a matter of fact, their mutual association was never given a name. It is noteworthy as well that Southex stipulated at trial that it never filed either a federal or state partnership tax return. <i>See Cochran v.

Unlike tangible real and personal property, whose ownership is more readily established (<i>e.g.,</i> by documentary evidence and public records), <i>see, e.g., Harrell Oil Co. of Mt. Airy v.

Southex reasons that since the Rhode Island partnership statute makes such profit sharing <i>prima facie</i> evidence of partnership formation, and RIBA failed to rebut that evidentiary presumption by establishing any of the five exceptions specified in subsection 7-12-18(4), the district court was <i>required</i> to find, as a matter of law, that a partnership was formed.

Thus, the undisputed evidence of profit sharing did not compel a determination that Southex and RIBA formed a partnership. Instead, the validity of the ruling below depends upon whether the district court correctly assessed the totality of the circumstances. <i>See supra</i> note 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Southex next urges that the 1974 Agreement necessitated a finding of partnership formation, in that it unambiguously describes the contracting parties as \"partners.\" Consequently, Southex insists, the district court erred by considering extrinsic evidence regarding the meaning of the term \"partners,\" <i>viz.,</i> by crediting testimony that RIBA and Southex's predecessor did not intend, in 1974, to employ the term \"partners\" in its strict legal sense, but merely in its colloquial sense, as a \"cooperative joint effort.\" Further, Southex asserts that because RIBA concededly reviewed the 1974 Agreement with counsel, we must presume that the term \"partners\" was employed in its strict legal sense.

As Southex sees it, this finding constituted legal error because (i) the law recognizes no such \"production-only\" or \"non-ownership\" partnership; and (ii) the undisputed evidence demonstrates that each contracting party contributed \"property\" (<i>e.g.,</i> clientele, goodwill or expertise) to the partnership. These contentions are immaterial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it is unnecessary to determine whether Rhode Island law would recognize a \"production-only\" or \"non-ownership\" partnership, because it is clear that the <i>absence of any joint-property ownership</i> is an entirely legitimate criterion for determining that no cognizable partnership was ever formed. <i>See McAleer,</i> 818 F.Supp. at 493; <i>Harrell Oil Co.,</i> 543 S.E.2d at 525 (\"`[C]o-ownership ... [is][an] indispensable requisite[ ] for a partnership.'\") (citation omitted). Consequently, the reference to a \"production-only\" or \"non-ownership\" partnership is immaterial, since Dagata is not competent to opine on Rhode Island partnership law. Instead, the question is whether the district court's determination &#8212; that the absence of any co-ownership of property weighed against a finding of partnership formation &#8212; constituted clear error. It did not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Southex further contends that the district court finding that Dagata, \"a layman with no legal training,\" drafted the 1974 Agreement, constituted reversible error because (i) there is no evidence as to the identity of the drafter, and (ii) in any event, Dagata reviewed the 1974 Agreement with counsel. Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the district court erred, the error was harmless. <i>See Moulton v.

The district court noted as well (i) that the term \"partners\" appeared \"only once and only in the preamble of the agreement,\" (ii) the 1974 Agreement was \"not labelled as a partnership agreement,\" (iii) the 1974 Agreement was \"devoid of many of the provisions ordinarily found in [a] partnership agreement,\" including a \"provision for the distribution of assets upon termination [of the partnership],\" and (iv) the 1974 Agreement contained other provisions inconsistent with an intent to form a partnership, such as its limited five-year term, SEM's full indemnification of RIBA, and SEM's commitment to advance all expenditures for the shows.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the district court identified extrinsic evidence that Manual Sherman disclaimed any ownership interest in the shows, that Southex never asked RIBA in 1994 whether Southex was acquiring a partnership interest, and that Southex had entered into related third-party contracts in its name alone, rather than any partnership name.

Southex identifies three pieces of evidence which purportedly created an affirmative duty on the part of RIBA to inform Southex, in 1994, that Southex was not acquiring a partnership interest; <i>viz.</i> (i) the reference to \"partners\" in the 1974 Agreement; (ii) the statements Dagata made to the local press that Reed Exhibitions had \"<i>sold</i> its home shows to Southex,\" <i>supra</i> note 1; and (iii) an article, in a 1994 RIBA trade publication, entitled: \"Southex Exhibitions <i>acquires</i> Home Show,\" <i>id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on the trial record, the district court reasonably could have found the following facts. Since the 1974 Agreement is ambiguous, in that it included no clear representation by RIBA that it regarded its relationship with SEM as a partnership, <i>both</i> RIBA and Southex were placed on fair notice to inquire into the nature of their relationship. Yet, at no time during the pre-transfer discussions between the Southex and RIBA representatives did either party raise the issue regarding whether Southex was to acquire ownership rights in the RIBA shows. Furthermore, RIBA merely consented to the 1994 agreement between Reed and Southex, whereby Reed transferred its rights under the 1974 Agreement, which consent neither necessitated nor implied any viewpoint on the part of RIBA regarding the nature of the contractual rights thereby transferred.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The pertinent transfer occurred between Southex <i>and Reed.</i> Southex neither established that it did not rely on <i>Reed</i>'s representations, nor that but for RIBA's silence it would not have acquired the rights to produce either the RIBA shows or the two other shows it simultaneously purchased from Reed along with the RIBA contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, like the 1974 Agreement itself, the two <i>post-consent</i> statements RIBA made to the press &#8212; allegedly proclaiming Reed's ownership rights in the RIBA shows &#8212; were internally contradictory as well as ambiguous, and, if anything, should have placed Southex on \"additional inquiry\" notice. While employing ambiguous terms, such as \"sold\" and \"acquires,\" which reasonably could portend <i>either</i> a transfer of partnership <i>or</i> nonpartnership rights, RIBA described Southex as the \"producer\" of the RIBA shows. Thus, the district court permissibly determined that Southex did not exercise due diligence in ascertaining and/or clarifying the terms of the 1974 Agreement which it was about to assume, and, consequently, that the equities did not clearly weigh in its favor. <i>See Greenwich Bay Yacht,</i> 537 A.2d at 991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Accordingly, the district court judgment is affirmed; costs are assessed against appellant.</i> <i>SO ORDERED.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> With regard to the acquisition by Southex, RIBA's Dagata inartfully advised the Providence Journal that Reed Exhibitions, SEM's successor-in-interest, had \"<i>sold</i> its home shows to Southex.\" One month later, an article appeared in an RIBA trade publication entitled: \"Southex Exhibitions <i>acquires</i> Home Show.\" (Emphasis added.)

For instance, it argues that the district court admitted hearsay testimony, by Ross Dagata, that Manual Sherman expressly disclaimed any ownership interest in the shows. RIBA counters that the Dagata testimony came within an exception to the hearsay rule, since Dagata testified as to Manual Sherman's state of mind or intent in signing a contract which contained the word \"partners.\"<i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 803(3). In reply, rather than explaining why Rule 803(3) is inapposite, Southex merely contends that RIBA adduced no evidence that Manual Sherman made this remark at or about the time he executed the 1974 Agreement.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We review rulings under Evidence Rule 803(3) only for abuse of discretion. <i>See Colasanto v. Life Ins. Co. of N.

The district court acted well within its discretion in finding that Manual Sherman, a sophisticated businessman, likely would have made his statement to Dagata, regarding his understanding of a contract, <i>before</i> he executed the contract. Indeed, Dagata testified that Manual Sherman stated that \"[h]e wanted no ownership of the show.... [a]nd ... we came to an agreement.\" The other evidentiary challenges asserted by Southex are unfounded as well.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> To the extent Southex based its estoppel claim on the Rhode Island statute, it is more than arguable that the UPA estoppel provision simply creates rights of action against partners<i>by third parties</i> (<i>i.e., non-partners</i>), rather than rights <i>inter se</i> alleged co-partners such as Southex. <i>See, e.g., Vergos v. Waterman Bldg. P'ship,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">613</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></span>, 389 (Ala.1993). The Rhode Island partnership statute provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">When a person, by words spoken or written or by conduct, represents him or herself, or consents to another representing him or her to any one, as a partner in an existing partnership or with one or more persons not actual partners, he or she is liable to any person to whom the representation has been made, who has, on the faith of the representation, given credit to the actual or apparent partnership, and if he or she has made a representation or consented to its being made in a public manner he or she is liable to the person, whether the representation has or has not been made or communicated to the person giving credit by or with the knowledge of the apparent partner making the representation or consenting to its being made.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 7-12-27. On the other hand, it is arguable as well that putative co-partners may still invoke the <i>common-law</i> doctrine of equitable estoppel. <i>See Vergos,</i> 613 So.2d at 389. We therefore assume, <i>arguendo,</i> that the Rhode Island courts permit such a cause of action.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Southex insists that its request that RIBA consent to the Reed-Southex transfer, together with the fact that RIBA's consent mentions the 1974 Agreement, \"clearly\" establish Southex's reliance. We cannot agree that such a request, reasonably asserted by parties attempting to assign a personal-services-type contract, necessarily implied a further request for RIBA's opinion regarding the nature of the contractual rights transferred.
