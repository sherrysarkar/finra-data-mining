PORTER, CAROL ANN PORTER AND SONS REALTY TRUST, ET AL.,\r\n\n                Plaintiffs, Appellants,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n                METROWEST BANK, ET AL.,\r\n\n                 Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n    [Hon. Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n          Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nDavid S. Porter and Carol A. Porter on brief pro se.\r\nKevin Hern, Jr., Craig J. Ziady, Riemer &amp; Braunstein, Daniel\r\nL. Goldgerg, S. Elaine McChesney, and Bingham Dana LLP on brief for\r\nappellees.\r\n\nNovember 3, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  We have carefully reviewed the parties' briefs\r\nand the record on appeal.  Appellants David S. Porter and his wife,\r\nCarol A. Porter, have appealed a district court \"Order of Closure\"\r\nwhich, in effect, is an order of abstention pending final\r\nresolution of related state court litigation.  The Porters have\r\nfiled this appeal despite Mr. Porter's statement at the district\r\ncourt hearing that they did not oppose deferring this federal\r\naction until after they have prevailed in their pending state court\r\nlitigation.  We have some concern about excusing the Porters from\r\ntheir inconsistent position.  Cf. Patriot Cinemas, Inc. v. General\r\nCinema Corp., 834 F.2d 208, 211-15 (1st Cir. 1987) (applying the\r\ndoctrine of \"judicial estoppel\" or \"preclusion of inconsistent\r\npositions\"  to party that repudiated its prior representation in\r\nstate court that it would not prosecute a state antitrust count). \r\nIn any event, however, we conclude that there was no abuse of\r\ndiscretion in the decision to abstain in this case.  See Elmendorf\r\nGrafica, Inc. v. D.S. Am. (E.), Inc., 48 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).\r\nThere is no merit to the Porters' claim that the abstention\r\norder violates their First Amendment right to petition the courts. \r\nWe also reject the Porters' claim, first raised in this appeal,\r\nthat the district court was biased and had an apparent conflict of\r\ninterest.  Although the court was candid in its views of the\r\nPorters' extended litigation history and strategy, these views had\r\nsupport in the record and did not \"display a deep-seated favoritism\r\nor antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\"  Liteky v.\r\nUnited States, 510 U.S. 540, 555 (1994).  The allegation of an\r\napparent conflict of interest borders on the frivolous and requires\r\nno further comment.\r\nAffirmed.\r\n",
