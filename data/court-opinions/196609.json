In  this habeas corpus proceeding  under 28\r                           \r\n\nU.S.C.    2254,  petitioner  Peter White  complains that  the\r\n\nMassachusetts Parole Board abridged his due process rights by\r\n\nwaiting some eleven years before executing a parole violation\r\n\nwarrant  against him.    During that  period, petitioner  was\r\n\nfirst awaiting  trial on, and then  incarcerated for, several\r\n\nfederal offenses.  We  agree with the district court  that no\r\n\nconstitutional claim has been presented.  \r\n\n     Petitioner is  mistaken in arguing that  he was entitled\r\n\nto a revocation  hearing prior  to his  release from  federal\r\n\ncustody  in 1992.    Prior thereto,  as the  Magistrate-Judge\r\n\nobserved,  petitioner  was never  \"taken  into  custody as  a\r\n\nparole violator by execution  of the warrant\"--the event that\r\n\ntriggers  the right to a prompt revocation hearing.
