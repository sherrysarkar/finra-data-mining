The Historical Facts\r          A.   The Historical Facts\r                                   \r\n\n          For the period July 30,  1986, to July 30, 1987, defen-\r\n\ndant-appellee Travelers issued Dryden (i) a primary comprehensive\r\n\ngeneral liability insurance policy  (\"primary liability policy\"),\r\n\nwhich included \"property damage\" and \"personal  injury\" coverage,\r\n\nand  (ii) a  catastrophic  umbrella liability  policy  (\"umbrella\r\n\npolicy\").   For  the period  December 31,  1986, to  December 31,\r\n\n1987,  Travelers issued  Dryden  a  property  and  inland  marine\r                                              \r\n\ninsurance policy (\"property insurance policy\") as well, affording\r\n\ncoverage \"against all risks  of direct physical loss  or damage.\"\r\n\nTravelers  provided  Dryden  with  similar primary  and  umbrella\r\n\nliability coverage to July 30, 1988.  Defendant-appellee American\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nMutual  provided  primary  comprehensive  liability  coverage  to\r\n\nDryden from July 31, 1988, to December 1, 1989.   \r\n\n          On December 29,  1986, Dryden had leased  150 Worcester\r\n\nCenter Boulevard  (the \"Property\")  from White  &amp; Bagley  Company\r\n\n(\"White  &amp; Bagley\").   Thereafter,  Dryden used the  Property for\r\n\nmixing and manufacturing industrial lubricants and oils, as White\r\n\n&amp; Bagley  had done for many years.   On December 30, 1986, Dryden\r\n\nlisted the Property both in its primary and its umbrella liabili-\r\n\nty policies with Travelers.  Later, Dryden listed the Property in\r\n\nits property insurance  policy with Travelers and  its comprehen-\r\n\nsive liability policies with American Mutual as well.1 \r\n\n          On  December  31,  1986, White  &amp;  Bagley  conveyed the\r\n\nProperty to the White &amp; Bagley  Liquidation Trust.  On August 28,\r\n\n1987, the White  &amp; Bagley Liquidation Trust sold  the Property to\r\n\nWorcester Trust, together with an assignment of the Dryden lease.\r\n\nThe  latter transfer occurred  after Worcester Trust  had learned\r\n\nthe  results of  an  environmental  assessment  of  the  Property\r\n\nconducted pursuant  to Mass. Gen. L. ch.  21E (\"Massachusetts Oil\r\n\nand Hazardous  Material  Release Prevention  and Response  Act\"),\r\n\nwhich  indicated   \"limited  contamination\"   requiring  \"minimal\r\n\nremediation.\"    Dryden  continued to  lease  the  Property until\r\n\nDecember 31, 1988.\r\n\nB.   The Litigation\r          B.   The Litigation\r                             \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1As Dryden  does not  contend that  the liability  coverages\r\nafforded  under the American Mutual and Travelers policies differ\r\nin any  respect material  to the claims  presented on  appeal, we\r\nneed not  discuss either the  Travelers umbrella or  the American\r\nMutual primary liability policies.  \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          In  August   1990,  Worcester  Trust  brought  suit  in\r\n\nMassachusetts  Superior  Court  against,  inter  alios,  White  &amp;\r                                                                \r\n\nBagley, the White &amp; Bagley Liquidation Trust, Dryden and Prescott\r\n\nBagley, President  of Dryden  Oil of  New England  (collectively:\r\n\n\"Owners/  Operators\"), alleging, among  other things,  that there\r\n\nhad been \"spills or releases of oil, industrial lubricants and/or\r\n\nhazardous material  during  the  transfer,  storing,  mixing  and\r\n\nmanufacturing process\" throughout  the time White &amp;  Bagley owned\r\n\nthe  Property, which continued while Dryden occupied the Property\r\n\nunder  its lease  with  White  &amp; Bagley  and  resulted in  severe\r\n\ncontamination from \"oil and/or hazardous material.\"  \r\n\n          After the pleadings were closed, three  counts remained\r\n\nagainst,  inter alios,  the  Owners/Operators, including  Dryden.\r                               \r\n\nCounts I and II charged Dryden with liability for past and future\r\n\nresponse  costs imposed upon  Worcester Trust, pursuant  to Mass.\r\n\nGen. L. ch.  21E, for damage to  real and personal property,  and\r\n\nfor  related attorney fees,  incurred in connection  with alleged\r\n\n\"releases\"  at the  Property.    Count  III charged  Dryden  with\r\n\nliability for  damages sustained  by Worcester  Trust due  to the\r\n\n\"improper,  unsafe  and  otherwise  negligent  manner\"  in  which\r\n\nDryden,  inter alios,  \"stored oil, industrial  lubricants and/or\r                              \r\n\nhazardous materials.\"  Five  additional counts, directed  against\r\n\nDryden alone,  demanded damages for past and future losses caused\r\n\nWorcester Trust due to  Dryden's breaches of its  lease,2 various\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The lease obligated  Dryden to:  (1) pay  for all supplies,\r\nmaterials  and labor associated with cleaning and maintaining the\r\nProperty; (2) reimburse  the lessor for repairs  and replacements\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nforms  of \"waste\"  committed  on  the  Property,3  conversion  of\r\n\npersonal  property, and engaging in unfair  and deceptive acts or\r\n\npractices in its  leasehold relationship with Worcester  Trust in\r\n\nviolation of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 93A,    2 and 11. \r\n\n          In due  course,  after Travelers  and  American  Mutual\r\n\ndeclined to defend  or indemnify,  Dryden brought  a state  court\r\n\naction  for declaratory  relief,  breach  of  contract,  and  for\r\n\nalleged violations  of Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 93A  &amp; ch. 176D.   Once\r\n\nTravelers  and  American  Mutual removed  the  action  to federal\r\n\ndistrict court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.    1332, 1441, Dryden sought\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nnecessitated by Dryden's negligent or willful acts; (3) surrender\r\nthe Property in rentable condition; and (4) pay all attorney fees\r\nand expenses  incurred by the lessor in the  event of a breach or\r\ndefault by  Dryden under  the lease.   The lease  allowed Dryden,\r\nwith the lessor's approval,  to alter the Property in  conformity\r\nwith  all applicable  federal, state  and  local laws,  statutes,\r\nordinances and regulations.  \r\n\n     3For example, Count VI alleged as follows:  \r\n\n               a.   Lessee failed  to maintain  and re-\r\n          pair the property in satisfactory manner;\r\n               b.   Lessee physically damaged the Prop-\r\n          erty;\r\n               c.   Lessee failed to remove trash which\r\n          it left strewn throughout the Property;\r\n               d.   Lessee made alterations, additions,\r\n          improvements or changes to the Property with-\r\n          out the consent  of the lessor and  in viola-\r\n          tion of applicable  laws, statutes, ordinanc-\r\n          es, rules,  orders, regulations  and require-\r\n          ments of federal, state and local government;\r\n               e.   Lessee  willfully  and  indiscrimi-\r\n          nately removed property and fixtures from the\r\n          premises causing damage to the realty;\r\n               f.   Lessee abandoned personal property,\r\n          trade  fixtures  and  equipment,  making  the\r\n          premises unrentable; and \r\n               g.   . . . lessee caused the  release of\r\n          oil and/or hazardous material. \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nsummary judgment on its claim  for declaratory relief relating to\r\n\nthe alleged  duty to defend.   The  defendant insurers  responded\r\n\nwith cross-motions for summary judgment on all three counts.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court ultimately  adopted the  report  of a  magistrate\r\n\njudge and  entered summary  judgment for  Travelers and  American\r\n\nMutual on all counts.

These recognized aims  would be subverted by Dryden's\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\noverly  inventive reading of  Owned or Leased  Premises Exclusion\r\n\n(k).\r\n\n     3.   Contractual Liability Coverage\r               3.   Contractual Liability Coverage\r                                                  \r\n\n          Next, Dryden advances  two grounds  for its  contention\r\n\nthat the nonpollution-related contract claims alleged  by Worces-\r\n\nter Trust  are comprehended  by the  \"property damage\"  liability\r\n\ncoverage.   First, coverage  is provided for  an \"incidental con-\r\n\ntract,\" which  is extended by  the Broad Form CGL  Endorsement to\r\n\ninclude not only \"any  written . . . lease of  premises\" but also\r\n\n\"any  oral  or written  contract  or  agreement relating  to  the\r\n\nconduct of  the insured's business.\"   Second,  Dryden says,  the\r\n\nWorcester Trust nonpollution-related  contract claims arise  from\r\n\nmatters having to do with the written lease of the Property.  Its\r\n\nargument is untenable.\r\n\n          The policies exempt an  \"incidental contract,\" viz.,  a\r\n\nlease,  from the Contractual Liability Exclusion contained in the\r\n\nCGL Form, but not from Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k)  in\r                           \r\n\nthe CGL Form.   Under the Broad Form CGL Endorsement, the defini-\r\n\ntion of  \"incidental contract\"  is broadened  by the  Contractual\r\n\nLiability  Coverage provision, but the Broad Form CGL Endorsement\r\n\nleaves Owned or Leased Premises  Exclusion (k) in full force with\r\n\nreference  to Contractual  Liability Coverage.    Thus, by  clear\r\n\nimplication  Owned  or  Leased Premises  Exclusion  (k)  bars the\r\n\nextended  Contractual Liability Coverage in relation to an \"inci-\r\n\ndental contract.\"  \r\n\n          We  therefore conclude, as did the district court, that\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nthe property damage  coverage described in these  liability poli-\r\n\ncies imposed no duty upon the defendant insurers to defend Dryden\r\n\nin the  Worcester Trust action.   Furthermore, since the  duty to\r\n\nindemnify is narrower  than the duty to defend  under the primary\r\n\nliability policies, Waltham Indus. Labs. Corp., 883 F.2d at 1099,\r                                                        \r\n\nthe district court  correctly ruled  as well  that the  defendant\r\n\ninsurers were under no duty  to indemnify Dryden for any property\r\n\ndamage recoveries by Worcester Trust.7 \r\n\nB.

The term \"personal injury\" is defined as \r\n\n          (1) false arrest, detention, imprisonment, or\r\n          malicious prosecution; \r\n          (2) wrongful entry or eviction or other inva-\r\n          sion of the right of private occupancy; \r\n          (3) a publication or utterance \r\n               (a) of a libel  or slander or other\r\n               defamatory or  despairing material,\r\n               or \r\n               (b) in violation of an individual's\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7We  caution, however, that  the ultimate resolution  of the\r\nWorcester  Trust action  may affect  the duty to  indemnify under\r\nthese liability policies.  That is to say, should the evidence in\r\nthe  underlying Worcester Trust action against Dryden reveal that\r\nthere was  a covered occurrence,  and should  Worcester Trust  be\r\nallowed to  amend  its complaint,  Dryden  would be  entitled  to\r\nindemnification for the  damages recovered against it and for the\r\ncosts of its defense.

We do not agree.\r\n\n          The Travelers property insurance policy imposes no duty\r\n\nto defend  Dryden in  suits for \"physical  loss or damage.\"   Al-\r                   \r\n\nthough the  policy affords  Travelers the  option  to defend  its\r                                                           \r\n\ninsured,  Dryden  does  not contend  that  the  option to  defend\r                                                                           \r\n\nconstituted the requisite agreement, see Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

Since  defendants have no\r\n\nduty to defend  under their liability policies, and Travelers has\r\n\nno  duty  to  defend  under its  \"all  risks\"  property insurance\r\n\npolicy, we affirm  the district court rulings  rejecting Dryden's\r\n\nmotion  for partial  summary judgment,  and granting  defendants'\r\n\ncross-motion  for summary judgment,  on the duty  to defend under\r\n\nall the defendants' policies.           The     district    court\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\nconcluded that the property  insurance policy required  Travelers\r\n\nneither to  defend nor  indemnify Dryden,  since Worcester  Trust\r\n\nalleges  that all  damage to  the Property  was caused  by Dryden\r\n\nitself.  \r\n\n          [The  property   insurance]  policy   insured\r\n          Dryden Oil \"against all risks of direct phys-\r\n          ical loss or damage\" to buildings and person-\r\n          al property owned or  occupied by Dryden Oil.\r\n          This policy provides first-party coverage for\r\n          claims by Dryden  Oil that  its own  property\r\n          had  been damaged by  a third party,  not for\r                                                             \r\n          claims  that it had  damaged a third person's\r\n          property. .  . .

Moreover, neither Travelers nor the district court\r\n\nidentifies policy language  limiting the \"all risks\"  coverage to\r\n\ndamage caused by third parties.13  Finally, no one has cited, nor\r\n\nhave we  found, an  unambiguous provision  in the  Travelers \"all\r\n\nrisks\"  property  insurance  policy  excluding  coverage  for any\r\n\ndamage to  the Property  caused by  Dryden, the policyholder  and\r\n\ntenant.

There is  no\r\n\n\"property damage\" coverage under  the liability policies  because\r\n\nthe Worcester Trust  claims are expressly excepted  from coverage\r\n\nby  the  Absolute Pollution  Exclusion  or  the Owned  or  Leased\r\n\nPremises Exclusion.   There is  no coverage  under the  liability\r\n\npolicies for \"wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the\r\n\nright  of private  occupancy,\"  and  thus  no  \"personal  injury\"\r\n\ncoverage,  for the  Worcester Trust  claims  against its  tenant,\r\n\nDryden,  because wrongful  entry, wrongful  eviction,  and \"other\r\n\ninvasion[s]  of  the  right of  private  occupancy,\"  contemplate\r\n\nwrongful  conduct by  a landlord  against its  tenant.   Whatever\r\n\ncoverage may  be available under its \"all  risks\" property insur-\r\n\nance policy, Travelers has no  obligation to defend Dryden in the\r\n\nWorcester  Trust action, only an option  to defend.  Accordingly,\r\n\nas a  matter of  law, defendants  neither breached a  contractual\r\n\nduty to defend Dryden under any of their policies, nor a  duty to\r\n\nindemnify Dryden under their liability policies.16  Consequently,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     16After ruling that defendants were under no duty  to defend\r\nor indemnify  Dryden under  any of their  policies, the  district\r\ncourt  granted summary judgment  for defendants on  the dependent\r\nbreach-of-contract claim  as well.   Dryden  makes no  contention\r\nthat its breach-of-contract claim does not depend on the declara-\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nDryden's claims under Mass. Gen.  L. chapter 93A and chapter 176D\r\n\nfail as well.17\r\n\n          Finally, we are  unable to discern a  supportable basis\r\n\nfor the district court ruling that there was no duty to indemnify\r\n\nDryden  under the Travelers \"all risks\" property insurance policy\r\n\nsince Dryden itself caused the damage for which it seeks indemni-\r\n\nfication.  Consequently,  we vacate the declaratory ruling  as to\r\n\nthe duty  to indemnify  under the  property insurance  policy, as\r\n\nwell  as  its denial  of  the breach-of-contract  claim  which is\r\n\ndependent on  the unsupported  declaratory ruling.

For the period December 31, 1986, to December 31, 1987, Travelers issued Dryden a property and inland marine insurance policy (\"property insurance policy\") as well, affording coverage \"against all risks of direct physical loss or damage.\"   Travelers provided Dryden with similar primary and umbrella liability coverage to July 30, 1988.  Defendant-appellee American Mutual provided primary comprehensive liability coverage to Dryden from July 31, 1988, to December 1, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 29, 1986, Dryden had leased 150 Worcester Center Boulevard (the \"Property\") from White &amp; Bagley Company (\"White &amp; Bagley\").  Thereafter, Dryden used the Property for mixing and manufacturing industrial lubricants and oils, as White &amp; Bagley had done for many years.  On December 30, 1986, Dryden listed the Property both in its primary and its umbrella liability policies with Travelers.  Later, Dryden listed the Property in its property insurance policy with Travelers and its comprehensive liability policies with American Mutual as well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 31, 1986, White &amp; Bagley conveyed the Property to the White &amp; Bagley Liquidation Trust.  On August 28, 1987, the White &amp; Bagley Liquidation Trust sold the Property to Worcester Trust, together with an assignment of the Dryden lease.  The latter transfer occurred after Worcester Trust had learned the results of an environmental assessment of the Property conducted pursuant to Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  21E (\"Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention and Response Act\"), which indicated \"limited contamination\" requiring \"minimal remediation.\"   Dryden continued to lease the Property until December 31, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Litigation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1990, Worcester Trust brought suit in Massachusetts Superior Court against, inter alios, White &amp; Bagley, the White &amp; Bagley Liquidation Trust, Dryden and Prescott Bagley, President of Dryden Oil of New England (collectively:  \"Owners/ Operators\"), alleging, among other things, that there had been \"spills or releases of oil, industrial lubricants and/or hazardous material during the transfer, storing, mixing and manufacturing process\" throughout the time White &amp; Bagley owned the Property, which continued while Dryden occupied the Property under its lease with White &amp; Bagley and resulted in severe contamination from \"oil and/or hazardous material.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the pleadings were closed, three counts remained against, inter alios, the Owners/Operators, including Dryden.

Dryden Oil Co. of New England v. The Travelers Indem. Co., No. 92-40135, slip op. at 10 (D.Mass. Nov. 18, 1994) (Report and Recommendation) (citing Essex Ins. Co. v. Tri-Town Corp., 863 F.Supp. 38 (D.Mass.1994) (under Massachusetts law, Absolute Pollution Exclusion excepts coverage for physical injury from carbon monoxide releases)).  A fair reading of the Absolute Pollution Exclusion clause bars coverage for \" 'any form of pollution.' \"  United States Liab.  Ins. Co. v. Bourbeau, 49 F.3d 786, 788 (1st Cir.1995) (under Massachusetts law, lead paint chips deposited on land in the course of stripping and painting building constitute a \"pollutant\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dryden nonetheless contends that it cannot now be known whether the damage allegedly sustained by the Property resulted from a \"pollutant.\"   It relies on inapposite authority, see Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. City of Pittsburg, Kan., 791 F.Supp. 836 (D.Kan.1992), for its claim that diesel fuel is not a \"pollutant.\"   There, a sprayed mixture of diesel fuel and the insecticide malathion was held not to be a \"pollutant\" within the meaning of an exclusion clause which defined \"pollutants\" in a manner similar to the present exclusion clause.  As is readily apparent from an earlier and related case cited by Dryden, however, see Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. City of Pittsburg, Kan., 768 F.Supp. 1463 (D.Kan.1991), aff'd sub nom., Pennsylvania Nat'l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. City of Pittsburg, Kan., 987 F.2d 1516 (10th Cir.1993), and from an earlier and related case not cited by Dryden, see Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v.

City of Pittsburg, Kan., 987 F.2d 1516 (10th Cir.1993), the issue in the City of Pittsburg, Kan. trilogy was whether malathion mixed with diesel fuel--not diesel fuel alone--is a pollutant.  City of Pittsburg, Kan., 987 F.2d at 1517.   Moreover, the Tenth Circuit affirmed the district court on the basis that the \"spraying\" had been \"sudden and accidental\"--thereby removing it from the explicit language of the exclusion clause--not on the basis that the City was spraying a pollutant.  Id. at 1519-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, to which we look in this matter, see Commercial Union Ins., 7 F.3d at 1048, n. 1, recently assumed that a home heating oil spill \"was comprehended by an exclusion for 'loss ... caused by ... release, discharge or dispersal of contaminants.' \"  Hanover New England Ins. Co. v. Smith, 35 Mass.App.Ct. 417, 621 N.E.2d 382, 383 n. 2 (1993) (quoting Jussim v. Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co., 415 Mass. 24, 610 N.E.2d 954, 955 (1993)).  Whether or not oil or industrial chemicals necessarily constitute pollutants in all forms and circumstances, however, given the policy definition of \"pollutants\" and our reasoning in Bourbeau, supra, we think the absolute pollution exclusion language in these policies would not have permitted an objectively reasonable policyholder to expect liability coverage for contamination resulting from \"spills or releases of oil, industrial lubricants and/or hazardous material during the transfer, storing, mixing and manufacturing process\" as alleged in the Worcester Trust complaint against Dryden.  At the very least, an objectively reasonable policyholder would regard spills or releases of oil, industrial lubricants or hazardous material as \"materials to be disposed of or waste.\"  Bourbeau, 49 F.3d at 788 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, we think an objective policyholder reasonably could not have believed that \" 'smoke, vapor, soot, [and] fumes' would be considered pollutants,\" id. at 788-89 (alteration in original), whereas oil, lubricants and hazardous waste \"[were] not.\"  Id. at 789.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k)</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dryden challenges the district court ruling that the plain meaning of Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k) barred liability coverage for the Worcester Trust breach-of-contract claims for damages to the Property while Dryden leased and/or controlled the Property.  Dryden argues that the nonpollution-related claims alleged in counts VI, VII and VIII are neither comprehended within the Absolute Pollution Exclusion nor Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k), because \"[a]t the time the [Worcester Trust] claims were filed with [the Massachusetts Superior Court] Dryden [no longer] own[ed], occupi[ed], rent[ed] or control[led] the property.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming these claims are not within the Absolute Pollution Exclusion, we are nonetheless persuaded that liability coverage was barred by Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k).  Although exclusions must be strictly construed,  Waltham Indus. Labs.  Corp., 883 F.2d at 1097 (citing Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Abernathy, 393 Mass. 81, 469 N.E.2d 797, 799 (1984)), these primary liability policies explicitly restricted coverage to property damage occurrences \"during the policy period.\"   Consequently, no reasonably objective policyholder could have believed that Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k), which barred coverage for \"damage to ... property rented to the Insured,\" somehow converted the policies into \"claims-made\" policies to which Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k) no longer applied because the lease had lapsed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A primary function served by Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k) \"is to prevent the insured from using a liability insurance policy as if it provided property insurance.\"   Kenneth S. Abraham, Environmental Liability Insurance Law 163 (1991).  It likewise insulates against \"the 'moral hazard' problem where an insured has less incentive to take precaution owing to the existence of insurance.\"   Barry R. Ostrager &amp; Thomas R. Newman, Handbook on Insurance Coverage Disputes &#167; 10.03[b], at 441 (8th ed.1995) (quoting United States v. Conservation Chem.  Co., 653 F.Supp. 152, 199 (W.D.Mo.1986) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  These recognized aims would be subverted by Dryden's overly inventive reading of Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3. Contractual Liability Coverage</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Dryden advances two grounds for its contention that the nonpollution-related contract claims alleged by Worcester Trust are comprehended by the \"property damage\" liability coverage.  First, coverage is provided for an \"incidental contract,\" which is extended by the Broad Form CGL Endorsement to include not only \"any written ... lease of premises\" but also \"any oral or written contract or agreement relating to the conduct of the insured's business.\"   Second, Dryden says, the Worcester Trust nonpollution-related contract claims arise from matters having to do with the written lease of the Property.  Its argument is untenable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policies exempt an \"incidental contract,\" viz., a lease, from the Contractual Liability Exclusion contained in the CGL Form, but not from Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k) in the CGL Form.  Under the Broad Form CGL Endorsement, the definition of \"incidental contract\" is broadened by the Contractual Liability Coverage provision, but the Broad Form CGL Endorsement leaves Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k) in full force with reference to Contractual Liability Coverage.  Thus, by clear implication Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k) bars the extended Contractual Liability Coverage in relation to an \"incidental contract.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude, as did the district court, that the property damage coverage described in these liability policies imposed no duty upon the defendant insurers to defend Dryden in the Worcester Trust action.  Furthermore, since the duty to indemnify is narrower than the duty to defend under the primary liability policies,  Waltham Indus. Labs.  Corp., 883 F.2d at 1099, the district court correctly ruled as well that the defendant insurers were under no duty to indemnify Dryden for any property damage recoveries by Worcester Trust.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Id. (citing Moulton v. Groveton Papers Co., 112 N.H. 50, 289 A.2d 68, 72 (1972)).  As the complaint alleged no intentional invasion of the abutting landowners' property, Titan found no actionable wrongful entry claim under New Hampshire law.  Id. The Titan panel also questioned--though it did not decide--\"whether the alleged spreading of fumes, noise and light falls within the ordinary meaning of wrongful entry of property.\"  Id. at 272 n. 7. Thus, as the Fifth Circuit has noted, Titan \"did not hold that the migration of fumes, noise and light constituted a wrongful entry....\"  Gregory v. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., 948 F.2d 203, 209 (5th Cir.1991).  Finally, after observing that a wrongful eviction presupposes a landlord-tenant relationship, Titan, 898 F.2d at 272 (citing 52 C.J.S. Landlord &amp; Tenant &#167;&#167; 455 &amp; 460(1)), the Titan panel concluded that the personal injury liability coverage under the Titan policy was restricted to \"wrongful entry into, or eviction of a person from, a room, dwelling or premises that the person occupies.\"  Id. at 271-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dryden urges the same analogy, especially since trespass is not necessarily an intentional tort under Massachusetts law.

Its analogy simply does not fit.  Not only have we decided that the wrongful conduct comprehended by the \"personal injury\" coverage afforded under policies like the present one amounts to an intentional tort under Massachusetts law, see Continental Cas. Co. v. Canadian Universal Ins. Co., 924 F.2d at 373, but the Massachusetts tort of wrongful entry has yet to be extended beyond trespasses by landlords upon the leased premises.  See Gidwani v. Wasserman, 373 Mass. 162, 365 N.E.2d 827 (1977);  Tinkham v.

Dryden offers no authority for its unstated premise that a tenant in possession under a valid lease may be liable to its landlord for unlawful entry upon the leased premises under Massachusetts law.  Since wrongful eviction likewise contemplates wrongful conduct by a landlord against its tenant, see Squeri v. McCarrick, 32 Mass.App.Ct. 203, 588 N.E.2d 22 (1992), the Worcester Trust claims against Dryden plainly do not come within the personal injury coverage for \"wrongful entry or eviction\" under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dryden nonetheless argues that these Worcester Trust claims are embraced by the personal injury coverage as \"other invasion[s] of the right of private occupancy.\"  Titan addressed the scope of liability coverage afforded by this clause under New Hampshire law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  There, in addition to the policy issued by Titan, the City had a liability policy issued by Great Global, which afforded \"personal injury\" coverage for \" 'wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy.' \"  Titan, 898 F.2d at 272 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Titan panel first observed that \"an invasion of the right of private occupancy need not involve 'an appreciable and tangible interference with the physical property itself.' \"  Id.

See Gidwani, 365 N.E.2d at 830;  Tinkham, 65 N.E.2d at 16;  Squeri, 588 N.E.2d at 24.

Tortora, 922 F.2d 880, 887 (1st Cir.1990) (doctrine of ejusdem generis applies if \"the specific terms of an enumeration suggest a class which is not exhausted by the enumeration\"), in that it would afford coverage for \"personal injury\" or liability claims brought by tenants against their landlords, claims \"that are similar to but not encompassed by 'wrongful entry or eviction.' \"  Bernstein v. North East Ins. Co., 19 F.3d 1456, 1458 (D.C.Cir.1994) (racial discrimination by private landlord against prospective tenant is not an \"other invasion\").  See also Boston Hous.  Auth. v. Atlanta Int'l Ins.

Therefore, as did the district court, we hold that the applicable \"personal injury\" liability coverage imposed no duty to defend or indemnify Dryden against the Worcester Trust claims.  But cf. note 7 supra.C. The \"All Risks\" Property Insurance Policy</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Travelers property insurance policy included a \"Building and Personal Property Special Form\" (\"Special Form\") that \"insures against all risks of direct physical loss or damage except as otherwise provided in this form and other provisions of the policy which apply.\"   The Dryden complaint alleges that Travelers must defend Dryden in the Worcester Trust action because the \"damages sought therein constitute and concern 'risks of direct physical loss or damage' to 150 Worcester Center Boulevard.\"   It further alleges that Travelers must indemnify Dryden \"for all sums which [Dryden] may become legally obligated to pay as damages on account of any and 'all risks of direct and physical loss or damage' to the property known as 150 Worcester Center Boulevard.\"   Dryden contends that the Special Form obligates Travelers to defend and indemnify because \"the damages complained of by [Worcester Trust] are clearly covered by the policy\" and \"a consequent risk of any such damage is a lawsuit by [Worcester Trust], as Dryden's landlord, to recover the costs of such damage[ ]\" from Dryden, its tenant.  We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Travelers property insurance policy imposes no duty to defend Dryden in suits for \"physical loss or damage.\"   Although the policy affords Travelers the option to defend its insured, Dryden does not contend that the option to defend constituted the requisite agreement, see Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Sullivan, 33 Mass.App.Ct. 154, 597 N.E.2d 62, 63 (1992), upon which might be predicated a duty to defend.  Nor has Dryden demonstrated reason, see Dayton v. Peck, Stow and Wilcox Co.  (Pexto), 739 F.2d 690, 694 (1st Cir.1984) (court reluctant, sitting in diversity action, to extend state law), or authority for implying such a duty under Massachusetts law.  Cf. Shell Oil Co. v. Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., 12 Cal.App.4th 715, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d 815, 848 (1993) (no implied duty to defend under \"all risks\" policy) (California law).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude, as did the district court, though for different reasons, that Travelers assumed no duty under the property insurance policy to defend Dryden in connection with the Worcester Trust action.  Since defendants have no duty to defend under their liability policies, and Travelers has no duty to defend under its \"all risks\" property insurance policy, we affirm the district court rulings rejecting Dryden's motion for partial summary judgment, and granting defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment, on the duty to defend under all the defendants' policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the property insurance policy required Travelers neither to defend nor indemnify Dryden, since Worcester Trust alleges that all damage to the Property was caused by Dryden itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>[The property insurance] policy insured Dryden Oil \"against all risks of direct physical loss or damage\" to buildings and personal property owned or occupied by Dryden Oil.  This policy provides first-party coverage for claims by Dryden Oil that its own property had been damaged by a third party, not for claims that it had damaged a third person's property....  The simple conclusion is that the policy in question afforded Dryden Oil protection for damage to its property (i.e., Dryden Oil is covered for losses it suffers as a result of damage to its property) and not for damage [Dryden] caused to the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dryden Oil Co. of New England, No. 92-40135, slip op. at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dryden contends, however, that the \"all risks\" property insurance coverage does not depend upon who caused the damage to the Property.  Moreover, neither Travelers nor the district court identifies policy language limiting the \"all risks\" coverage to damage caused by third parties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Finally, no one has cited, nor have we found, an unambiguous provision in the Travelers \"all risks\" property insurance policy excluding coverage for any damage to the Property caused by Dryden, the policyholder and tenant.  See High Voltage Eng'g Corp., 981 F.2d at 600. Consequently, we are unable to discern a supportable basis for the district court holding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to suggest that Dryden necessarily can prevail on its claim for indemnity under the property insurance policy.  The difficulties impeding indemnity coverage determinations involving latent perils, such as accumulations of waste and hazardous materials, may become almost unmanageable in the abstract setting preceding a judicial determination as to the nature and extent of any damage, its causes and timing.  See generally, Dale L. Kingman, First Party Property Policies and Pollution Coverage, 28 Gonz.  L.Rev. 449, 471-72 (1993).  Be that as it may, the declaratory ruling that Travelers had no duty to indemnify Dryden under the \"all risks\" property insurance policy for any damage Dryden may have caused to the Property lacks discernible record support.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Therefore, we vacate that portion of the declaratory judgment and remand for such further proceedings, consistent with this opinion and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201(a), as the district court in its sound discretion deems appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under their liability policies, Travelers and American Mutual have no duty to defend and indemnify Dryden against the claims asserted in the Worcester Trust action.  There is no \"property damage\" coverage under the liability policies because the Worcester Trust claims are expressly excepted from coverage by the Absolute Pollution Exclusion or the Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion.  There is no coverage under the liability policies for \"wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy,\" and thus no \"personal injury\" coverage, for the Worcester Trust claims against its tenant, Dryden, because wrongful entry, wrongful eviction, and \"other invasion[s] of the right of private occupancy,\" contemplate wrongful conduct by a landlord against its tenant.  Whatever coverage may be available under its \"all risks\" property insurance policy, Travelers has no obligation to defend Dryden in the Worcester Trust action, only an option to defend.  Accordingly, as a matter of law, defendants neither breached a contractual duty to defend Dryden under any of their policies, nor a duty to indemnify Dryden under their liability policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Consequently, Dryden's claims under Mass.  Gen. L. chapter 93A and chapter 176D fail as well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are unable to discern a supportable basis for the district court ruling that there was no duty to indemnify Dryden under the Travelers \"all risks\" property insurance policy since Dryden itself caused the damage for which it seeks indemnification.  Consequently, we vacate the declaratory ruling as to the duty to indemnify under the property insurance policy, as well as its denial of the breach-of-contract claim which is dependent on the unsupported declaratory ruling.  Accordingly, these interdependent claims are remanded for such further proceedings, consistent with this opinion and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201(a), as the district court in its sound discretion deems appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed, in part, and reversed and remanded, in part;  the parties shall bear their own costs.

That is to say, should the evidence in the underlying Worcester Trust action against Dryden reveal that there was a covered occurrence, and should Worcester Trust be allowed to amend its complaint, Dryden would be entitled to indemnification for the damages recovered against it and for the costs of its defense.

Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 64 F.3d 1015, 1021-25 (6th Cir.1995).  We need not consider whether the absolute pollution exclusion applies to the personal injury liability coverage under Massachusetts law, since we conclude that the complaint alleges no claim within the \"personal injury\" coverage under these policies</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Dryden relies on Scottish Guar. Ins. Co. v. Dwyer, 19 F.3d 307, 311 (7th Cir.1994), which cites Titan as support for the holding that \"wrongful entry\" equates with \"trespass\" under Wisconsin law, which, like Massachusetts law, does not require that an actionable trespass have been intentional.  Even though the Dwyer panel did not take issue with the insurer's \"assert[ion] that the term 'wrongful entry' has been used by Wisconsin courts in only one context--the improper entry by a landlord onto the leased property of a tenant,\" id., it reasoned that \"nothing [in the Wisconsin cases cited by the insurer] suggests that the tort [of wrongful entry] should be limited to landlord-tenant disputes.\"  Id. The Dwyer panel went on to say:  \"When faced with a similar lack of controlling authority under New Hampshire law, [the First Circuit] concluded that the tort of wrongful entry 'most closely resembles that of trespass.' \"  Id. (quoting Titan, 898 F.2d at 272).   In doing so, Dwyer extended Titan beyond its rationale</p>\n        <p>Titan equated the tort of wrongful entry with trespass under New Hampshire law only because the panel was \"unable to find any New Hampshire cases defining a tort of wrongful entry.\"  Titan, 898 F.2d at 272 (emphasis added).  Whereas Massachusetts case law has defined the tort of wrongful entry only in the context of an intrusion by the landlord upon the premises leased by its tenant.  Against this inapposite decisional backdrop, therefore, we decline to broaden the scope of the Massachusetts tort of wrongful entry absent a clear signal from the Commonwealth courts, especially in the instant context where the insurance contract definition for \"personal injury\" liability is \"very limited.\"  LaFrance, 594 N.E.2d at 551.</p>\n        <p>Absent some authoritative signal from the legislature or the courts of Massachusetts, we see no basis for even considering the pros and cons of innovative theories....

The Historical Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the period July 30, 1986, to July 30, 1987, defendant-appellee Travelers issued Dryden (i) a primary comprehensive general liability insurance policy (\"primary liability policy\"), which included \"property damage\" and \"personal injury\" coverage, and (ii) a catastrophic umbrella liability policy (\"umbrella policy\").  For the period December 31, 1986, to December 31, 1987, Travelers issued Dryden a property and inland marine insurance policy (\"property insurance policy\") as well, affording coverage \"against all risks of direct physical loss or damage.\"   Travelers provided Dryden with similar primary and umbrella liability coverage to July 30, 1988.  Defendant-appellee American Mutual provided primary comprehensive liability coverage to Dryden from July 31, 1988, to December 1, 1989.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 29, 1986, Dryden had leased 150 Worcester Center Boulevard (the \"Property\") from White &amp; Bagley Company (\"White &amp; Bagley\").  Thereafter, Dryden used the Property for mixing and manufacturing industrial lubricants and oils, as White &amp; Bagley had done for many years.  On December 30, 1986, Dryden listed the Property both in its primary and its umbrella liability policies with Travelers.  Later, Dryden listed the Property in its property insurance policy with Travelers and its comprehensive liability policies with American Mutual as well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 31, 1986, White &amp; Bagley conveyed the Property to the White &amp; Bagley Liquidation Trust.  On August 28, 1987, the White &amp; Bagley Liquidation Trust sold the Property to Worcester Trust, together with an assignment of the Dryden lease.  The latter transfer occurred after Worcester Trust had learned the results of an environmental assessment of the Property conducted pursuant to Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  21E (\"Massachusetts Oil and Hazardous Material Release Prevention and Response Act\"), which indicated \"limited contamination\" requiring \"minimal remediation.\"   Dryden continued to lease the Property until December 31, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Litigation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1990, Worcester Trust brought suit in Massachusetts Superior Court against, inter alios, White &amp; Bagley, the White &amp; Bagley Liquidation Trust, Dryden and Prescott Bagley, President of Dryden Oil of New England (collectively:  \"Owners/ Operators\"), alleging, among other things, that there had been \"spills or releases of oil, industrial lubricants and/or hazardous material during the transfer, storing, mixing and manufacturing process\" throughout the time White &amp; Bagley owned the Property, which continued while Dryden occupied the Property under its lease with White &amp; Bagley and resulted in severe contamination from \"oil and/or hazardous material.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the pleadings were closed, three counts remained against, inter alios, the Owners/Operators, including Dryden.  Counts I and II charged Dryden with liability for past and future response costs imposed upon Worcester Trust, pursuant to Mass.  Gen. L. ch.  21E, for damage to real and personal property, and for related attorney fees, incurred in connection with alleged \"releases\" at the Property.  Count III charged Dryden with liability for damages sustained by Worcester Trust due to the \"improper, unsafe and otherwise negligent manner\" in which Dryden, inter alios, \"stored oil, industrial lubricants and/or hazardous materials.\"   Five additional counts, directed against Dryden alone, demanded damages for past and future losses caused Worcester Trust due to Dryden's breaches of its lease,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> various forms of \"waste\" committed on the Property,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> conversion of personal property, and engaging in unfair and deceptive acts or practices in its leasehold relationship with Worcester Trust in violation of Mass.

Gen. L. ch.  93A &amp; ch.  176D. Once Travelers and American Mutual removed the action to federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1332, 1441, Dryden sought summary judgment on its claim for declaratory relief relating to the alleged duty to defend.  The defendant insurers responded with cross-motions for summary judgment on all three counts.  The district court ultimately adopted the report of a magistrate judge and entered summary judgment for Travelers and American Mutual on all counts.

Contractual Liability Coverage</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Dryden advances two grounds for its contention that the nonpollution-related contract claims alleged by Worcester Trust are comprehended by the \"property damage\" liability coverage.  First, coverage is provided for an \"incidental contract,\" which is extended by the Broad Form CGL Endorsement to include not only \"any written ... lease of premises\" but also \"any oral or written contract or agreement relating to the conduct of the insured's business.\"   Second, Dryden says, the Worcester Trust nonpollution-related contract claims arise from matters having to do with the written lease of the Property.  Its argument is untenable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The policies exempt an \"incidental contract,\" viz., a lease, from the Contractual Liability Exclusion contained in the CGL Form, but not from Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k) in the CGL Form.  Under the Broad Form CGL Endorsement, the definition of \"incidental contract\" is broadened by the Contractual Liability Coverage provision, but the Broad Form CGL Endorsement leaves Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k) in full force with reference to Contractual Liability Coverage.  Thus, by clear implication Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion (k) bars the extended Contractual Liability Coverage in relation to an \"incidental contract.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude, as did the district court, that the property damage coverage described in these liability policies imposed no duty upon the defendant insurers to defend Dryden in the Worcester Trust action.  Furthermore, since the duty to indemnify is narrower than the duty to defend under the primary liability policies,  Waltham Indus. Labs.  Corp., 883 F.2d at 1099, the district court correctly ruled as well that the defendant insurers were under no duty to indemnify Dryden for any property damage recoveries by Worcester Trust.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Id. (citing Moulton v.

As the complaint alleged no intentional invasion of the abutting landowners' property, Titan found no actionable wrongful entry claim under New Hampshire law.  Id. The Titan panel also questioned--though it did not decide--\"whether the alleged spreading of fumes, noise and light falls within the ordinary meaning of wrongful entry of property.\"  Id. at 272 n. 7.

Finally, after observing that a wrongful eviction presupposes a landlord-tenant relationship, Titan, 898 F.2d at 272 (citing 52 C.J.S. Landlord &amp; Tenant &#167;&#167; 455 &amp; 460(1)), the Titan panel concluded that the personal injury liability coverage under the Titan policy was restricted to \"wrongful entry into, or eviction of a person from, a room, dwelling or premises that the person occupies.\"  Id. at 271-72.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dryden urges the same analogy, especially since trespass is not necessarily an intentional tort under Massachusetts law.  See Sheppard Envelope Co. v. Arcade Malleable Iron Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2091618\"><a href=\"/opinion/2091618/sheppard-envelope-co-v-arcade-malleable-iron-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2091618\"><a href=\"/opinion/2091618/sheppard-envelope-co-v-arcade-malleable-iron-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span> (1956) (airborne emissions of cinders and other gritty materials, negligent or otherwise, constitute a continuing trespass).  Its analogy simply does not fit.  Not only have we decided that the wrongful conduct comprehended by the \"personal injury\" coverage afforded under policies like the present one amounts to an intentional tort under Massachusetts law, see Continental Cas. Co. v. Canadian Universal Ins. Co., 924 F.2d at 373, but the Massachusetts tort of wrongful entry has yet to be extended beyond trespasses by landlords upon the leased premises.  See Gidwani v.

Since defendants have no duty to defend under their liability policies, and Travelers has no duty to defend under its \"all risks\" property insurance policy, we affirm the district court rulings rejecting Dryden's motion for partial summary judgment, and granting defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment, on the duty to defend under all the defendants' policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the property insurance policy required Travelers neither to defend nor indemnify Dryden, since Worcester Trust alleges that all damage to the Property was caused by Dryden itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>[The property insurance] policy insured Dryden Oil \"against all risks of direct physical loss or damage\" to buildings and personal property owned or occupied by Dryden Oil.  This policy provides first-party coverage for claims by Dryden Oil that its own property had been damaged by a third party, not for claims that it had damaged a third person's property....  The simple conclusion is that the policy in question afforded Dryden Oil protection for damage to its property (i.e., Dryden Oil is covered for losses it suffers as a result of damage to its property) and not for damage [Dryden] caused to the Property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dryden Oil Co. of New England, No. 92-40135, slip op. at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dryden contends, however, that the \"all risks\" property insurance coverage does not depend upon who caused the damage to the Property.  Moreover, neither Travelers nor the district court identifies policy language limiting the \"all risks\" coverage to damage caused by third parties.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Finally, no one has cited, nor have we found, an unambiguous provision in the Travelers \"all risks\" property insurance policy excluding coverage for any damage to the Property caused by Dryden, the policyholder and tenant.  See High Voltage Eng'g Corp., 981 F.2d at 600. Consequently, we are unable to discern a supportable basis for the district court holding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to suggest that Dryden necessarily can prevail on its claim for indemnity under the property insurance policy.  The difficulties impeding indemnity coverage determinations involving latent perils, such as accumulations of waste and hazardous materials, may become almost unmanageable in the abstract setting preceding a judicial determination as to the nature and extent of any damage, its causes and timing.  See generally, Dale L. Kingman, First Party Property Policies and Pollution Coverage, 28 Gonz.  L.Rev. 449, 471-72 (1993).  Be that as it may, the declaratory ruling that Travelers had no duty to indemnify Dryden under the \"all risks\" property insurance policy for any damage Dryden may have caused to the Property lacks discernible record support.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Therefore, we vacate that portion of the declaratory judgment and remand for such further proceedings, consistent with this opinion and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201(a), as the district court in its sound discretion deems appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under their liability policies, Travelers and American Mutual have no duty to defend and indemnify Dryden against the claims asserted in the Worcester Trust action.  There is no \"property damage\" coverage under the liability policies because the Worcester Trust claims are expressly excepted from coverage by the Absolute Pollution Exclusion or the Owned or Leased Premises Exclusion.  There is no coverage under the liability policies for \"wrongful entry or eviction or other invasion of the right of private occupancy,\" and thus no \"personal injury\" coverage, for the Worcester Trust claims against its tenant, Dryden, because wrongful entry, wrongful eviction, and \"other invasion[s] of the right of private occupancy,\" contemplate wrongful conduct by a landlord against its tenant.  Whatever coverage may be available under its \"all risks\" property insurance policy, Travelers has no obligation to defend Dryden in the Worcester Trust action, only an option to defend.  Accordingly, as a matter of law, defendants neither breached a contractual duty to defend Dryden under any of their policies, nor a duty to indemnify Dryden under their liability policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Consequently, Dryden's claims under Mass.  Gen. L. chapter 93A and chapter 176D fail as well.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we are unable to discern a supportable basis for the district court ruling that there was no duty to indemnify Dryden under the Travelers \"all risks\" property insurance policy since Dryden itself caused the damage for which it seeks indemnification.  Consequently, we vacate the declaratory ruling as to the duty to indemnify under the property insurance policy, as well as its denial of the breach-of-contract claim which is dependent on the unsupported declaratory ruling.  Accordingly, these interdependent claims are remanded for such further proceedings, consistent with this opinion and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2201(a), as the district court in its sound discretion deems appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed, in part, and reversed and remanded, in part;  the parties shall bear their own costs.

Even though the Dwyer panel did not take issue with the insurer's \"assert[ion] that the term 'wrongful entry' has been used by Wisconsin courts in only one context--the improper entry by a landlord onto the leased property of a tenant,\" id., it reasoned that \"nothing [in the Wisconsin cases cited by the insurer] suggests that the tort [of wrongful entry] should be limited to landlord-tenant disputes.\"  Id. The Dwyer panel went on to say:  \"When faced with a similar lack of controlling authority under New Hampshire law, [the First Circuit] concluded that the tort of wrongful entry 'most closely resembles that of trespass.' \"  Id. (quoting Titan, 898 F.2d at 272).   In doing so, Dwyer extended Titan beyond its rationale</p>\n        <p>Titan equated the tort of wrongful entry with trespass under New Hampshire law only because the panel was \"unable to find any New Hampshire cases defining a tort of wrongful entry.\"  Titan, 898 F.2d at 272 (emphasis added).  Whereas Massachusetts case law has defined the tort of wrongful entry only in the context of an intrusion by the landlord upon the premises leased by its tenant.  Against this inapposite decisional backdrop, therefore, we decline to broaden the scope of the Massachusetts tort of wrongful entry absent a clear signal from the Commonwealth courts, especially in the instant context where the insurance contract definition for \"personal injury\" liability is \"very limited.\"  LaFrance, 594 N.E.2d at 551.</p>\n        <p>Absent some authoritative signal from the legislature or the courts of Massachusetts, we see no basis for even considering the pros and cons of innovative theories....
