Defendant  Santiago Panzardi-Lespier\r                                 \r\n\nappeals from the district court judgment and sentence entered\r\n\non  a  jury  verdict  finding him  guilty  of  conspiring  to\r\n\ndistribute more than 1000 pounds of marijuana in violation of\r\n\n21  U.S.C.    841(a)(1) and 846 and possessing less than 1000\r\n\npounds of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of\r\n\n21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.   2.   We briefly address\r\n\nthe two major points defendant raises on appeal.\r\n\n     1.   We need not  resolve defendant's argument  that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred in not dismissing the indictment because\r\n\nno  evidence linking  defendant  to the  alleged offense  was\r\n\npresented to the grand jury.  Defendant waived that objection\r\n\nto the indictment by not raising it before the trial.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Mack, 892 F.2d 134, 135-136 (1st Cir. 1989), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 498 U.S. 859 (1990); Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b). \r                  \r\n\n     Defendant has offered no  explanation for his failure to\r\n\ncomply with  Rule 12, and he has made no showing of cause for\r\n\nrelief  from the waiver.  Further, in ruling on defendant's  \r\n\n2255 petition, the district  court specifically rejected  his\r\n\nclaim  of ineffective  assistance of  counsel for  failure to\r\n\nobject to the indictment, and defendant has not appealed from\r\n\nthat  ruling.   Accordingly  we  will not  consider  his late\r\n\nchallenge to the indictment.\r\n\n     2.   Defendant  also  argues that  he was  substantially\r\n\nprejudiced by  spillover evidence  from the other  counts and\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\ndefendants  and  that the  district  court  erred in  denying\r\n\nseverance of counts and defendants.  We also need not resolve\r\n\nthat  argument because  defendant  waived this  objection  by\r\n\nfailing to raise it before trial.\r\n\n     Requests  for severance  of counts  or  defendants under\r\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14 must be raised prior to\r\n\ntrial.

Accordingly, we\r\n\nwill not consider it now.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  Loc.R. 27.1.\r                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n",
