However, appellant never filed a notice of appeal from\r\n\nthis  dismissal;  as such,  it is  not before  us.   The only\r\n\norders  from which  a timely  appeal has  been taken  are the\r\n\ndenial  of appellant's motion to reopen and the denial of the\r\n\naccompanying motion  for emergency  relief.

The motion to reopen, which is a typewritten version\r\n\nof  appellant's complaint,  offers no  explanation concerning\r\n\nthis  issue.   Although  appellant  sets  out  how  the  RECD\r\n\nallegedly  prohibited  him  from  pursuing  an administrative\r\n\nappeal, he does not describe any improper conduct by the RECD\r\n\nwith  regard to  the  dismissal of  appellant's complaint  or\r\n\nerror in the district court's dismissal of appellant's action\r\n\nfor failure to effectuate service.\r\n\n          As for Rule 60(b)(6), it cannot be used \"to  escape\r\n\nthe  consequences of failure to take a timely appeal.\"  Cotto\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.
