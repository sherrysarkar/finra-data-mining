This    case   raises    important\n\nquestions   about    the   scope    of    the    attorney-client        privilege.\n\nWilliam and Patricia Cavallaro (\"Cavallaros\") owned Knight Tool\n\nCo., Inc., founded in 1976.              Their adult sons owned Camelot\n\nSystems, Inc., created in 1987.            The Cavallaros and their sons\n\nmerged their respective corporations in 1995 and, on July 1, 1996,\n\nthe   merged    entity       sold   for     approximately         $97     million.\n\nSubsequently, the Internal Revenue Service began an investigation\n\ninto the Cavallaros' correct estate and gift tax (\"transfer tax\")\n\nliabilities.     The   IRS    suspected     that       the   parties    might   have\nundervalued the Cavallaros' Knight company and overvalued the sons'\n\nCamelot company to disguise a gift to the sons in the form of post-\nmerger stock.\n            In the course of this investigation, the IRS served a\n\nsummons on Ernst & Young, an accounting firm that Camelot had\nretained in June of 1994.      The summons requested that Ernst & Young\nproduce \"all records\" in its possession regarding any work it did\n\nbetween 1984 and 1995 for the Cavallaros, their sons, and their\nrespective corporations. The Cavallaros moved to quash the summons\nas overly broad and calling for privileged materials.                  They argued\n\nthat the documents in Ernst & Young's possession were protected by\nthe attorney-client privilege because the documents were created\nby, or provided to, Ernst & Young in the course of the efforts of\n\nthe law firm Hale and Dorr to provide legal advice; particularly,\nadvice sought in 1994 and 1995 concerning transfer tax and merger\n\nissues arising from the close relationship between Camelot and\n\n                                     -2-\n\fKnight. The IRS counterclaimed for enforcement of the summons. On\n\nJuly 27, 2001, the district court denied the Cavallaros' petition\n\nto   quash   and   allowed      the   government's         motion    to    enforce   the\nsummons.     Cavallaro v. United States, 153 F. Supp. 2d 52 (D. Mass.\n\n2001).     Subsequently, the district court granted the Cavallaros'\n\nmotion for stay pending appeal, thereby permitting the Cavallaros\nto continue to refrain from disclosing the documents that they\n\nallege are privileged.\n\n             As in the district court proceedings, three categories of\n\ndocuments     requested    by    the   IRS    are     at    issue:    (1)    documents\n\npertaining    to   the    December     19,    1994,    meeting       --    between   the\n\nCavallaros, their sons, a Camelot accountant, accountants from\n\nErnst & Young, and at least one lawyer from Hale and Dorr --\naddressing     transfer    tax    issues;      (2)    subsequent          transfer   tax\n\ncommunications arising from the December 19 meeting; and (3)\n\ndocuments related to communications addressing the 1995 merger of\nKnight and Camelot.       All of the requested documents are in Ernst &\n\nYoung's possession. They are all documents either created by Ernst\n\n& Young or transmitted to Ernst & Young, not documents preserved\n\nsolely in Hale and Dorr's files.\n\n             On appeal, as in the district court, the Cavallaros argue\n\nthat these documents are privileged under United States v. Kovel,\n\n296 F.2d 918 (2d Cir. 1961), despite having been either created by\n\nor disclosed to Ernst & Young, because Ernst & Young aided Hale and\n\nDorr in providing legal advice. They also argue that the documents\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\ffall   within   the   common-interest          exception    to   the    rule    that\n\ndisclosure to a third party waives the attorney-client privilege.\n\n           Assuming arguendo that this circuit would adopt the Kovel\n\nrule, we conclude that the documents are not privileged. We follow\n\nsomewhat different reasoning than the district court.                  We need not\n\ndecide whether, in all instances, the attorney or client (as\nopposed to some third party) must hire the accountant in order to\n\nsustain a privilege under Kovel.           Kovel requires that to sustain a\n\nprivilege an accountant must be \"necessary, or at least highly\n\nuseful, for the effective consultation between the client and the\n\nlawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.\"                     296 F.2d at\n\n922.     Here, no party hired Ernst & Young for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, the attorney-client privilege did not extend to the\ndocuments in question under the Kovel doctrine.                Having found that\n\nthe documents were not covered by the attorney-client privilege, we\n\nalso conclude that they cannot fall within the common-interest\nexception, which presumes a valid underlying privilege in the first\n\nplace.     Consequently,      we   do    not    reach    the   district    court's\nconclusion that \"[u]nder the strict confines of the common-interest\n\ndoctrine, the lack of representation for [the sons and Camelot]\n\nvitiates any claim to a privilege,\" Cavallaro, 153 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n61, because Ernst & Young was providing accounting services and so\n\nthe Kovel extension      of    the      privilege   is     inapplicable    to    the\n\nsummoned documents, all of which were created by or disclosed to\n\nErnst & Young.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f                                           I.\n\n            The following facts are undisputed except where otherwise\n\nnoted.    In 1976, the Cavallaros formed Knight Tool Co., Inc., to\n\nmanufacture    tools    to    be    used    by   companies   such   as   McDonnell\n\nDouglas, Polaroid, and Raytheon to assemble their products.                  Seven\n\nyears later, in 1983, William Cavallaro and one of his three sons,\n\nKenneth, developed a rudimentary glue-dispensing machine, which,\n\nfor several years, was commercially unsuccessful due, at least in\n\npart, to difficulty in marketing the machine.\n\n            In 1987, the Cavallaros formed a new company, Camelot\nSystems, Inc., to give the Cavallaros' three sons an opportunity to\n\npursue the glue-dispensing machine business. In addition to paying\nits own employees, Knight paid the salaries of Camelot's employees.\nThe three sons were named as Camelot's sole shareholders and,\n\nalthough Knight continued to make the glue-dispensing machines,\nCamelot   became     the     machines'      only   distributor.        Knight   was\nCamelot's biggest supplier.           In fact, Camelot's only business was\n\nselling glue-dispensing machines and accessories manufactured by\nKnight.     The sons, working at Camelot, completely redesigned the\nKnight glue-dispensing machine and developed several new models of\n\nthe machine.    As a result, Camelot became a lucrative business.\n            In 1992, the Cavallaros contacted attorney Louis Hamel\nJr.   Hamel was a long-time senior partner at the Hale and Dorr law\n\nfirm, specializing in trusts and estates, exempt organizations, and\npensions.      He,     along       with    other   Hale   and   Dorr     attorneys,\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fperiodically counseled the Cavallaros regarding Knight corporate\n\nmatters.\n\n              The Cavallaros again contacted Hamel, in October 1994,\nthis time for help with estate and retirement planning.                              Hamel\n\nconsidered, among other things, potential transfer tax issues\n\narising      in    the    context    of    the    close    business        and    family\nrelationships between Knight and Camelot.                      Between December 19,\n\n1994, and December 31, 1995, Hale and Dorr provided legal advice to\n\nKnight and the Cavallaros, acting on Knight's behalf, with respect\n\nto the merger of Knight into Camelot.                 Hale and Dorr advised the\n\nCavallaros on, among other things, the drafting of affidavits\n\npurporting        to   establish    the   pre-merger      values     of    Knight      and\n\nCamelot.\n              While the Cavallaros were receiving legal advice from\n\nHale   and    Dorr,      their   sons,    as    agents    of    Camelot,    had      begun\n\nreceiving tax planning advice from Ernst & Young.                     Camelot began\nmeeting with Ernst & Young in June of 1994.                    On November 16, 1994,\n\nErnst & Young documented its relationship with Camelot in a letter\n\nof engagement, stating that Ernst & Young would be providing a\n\n\"Review      of    Corporate     Structure      and   Recommendations,\"          a    \"Tax\n\nCheckup,\" and \"Transfer Planning.\"               The letter, addressed to David\n\nFrac, Camelot's Chief Financial Officer, further stated that \"[a]ll\n\nadvice and other services we provide pursuant to this engagement\n\nare solely for the benefit of Camelot . . . and not for the benefit\n\nof anyone other than the corporation and its shareholders.\"                           Frac\n\nsigned the letter and returned it to Ernst & Young.\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f            A draft of the invoice, however, for Ernst & Young's\n\nservices rendered through December 31, 1994, which explicitly\n\nincluded    tax   services   rendered       pursuant    to   the     November   14\nengagement letter, refers to services rendered to both Camelot and\n\nKnight.     It was addressed and mailed to Mrs. Cavallaro at Knight.\n\nIn addition, Lawrence Goodman, of Ernst & Young, testified in his\nOctober 27, 2000, deposition that, in 1994, he was involved in\n\nproviding tax advice to Camelot, Knight, and the Cavallaros.                    He\n\nalso testified that around November or December of 1995, an Ernst\n\n& Young employee began providing services to both Camelot and\n\nKnight.      The district court, nonetheless, concluded that \"the\n\nundisputed evidence is that Ernst & Young was paid by, and worked\n\nsolely for, Camelot and its shareholders.\" Cavallaro, 153 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 58.\n\n             On December 15, 1994, Ernst & Young sent a letter to\n\nWilliam Cavallaro recommending the merger of Knight and Camelot and\nsuggesting a strategy for minimizing transfer tax liability. Ernst\n\n&   Young   understood   that   the   Cavallaros       and   their    sons   would\n\nconsider selling their respective companies, and proceeded to\n\nexplain how the parties might structure the corporate relationship\n\nin order to facilitate a transfer of some of the proceeds from such\n\na sale from the Cavallaros to their children while minimizing tax\n\nliability.     Ernst & Young stated that the letter would \"serve as\n\nthe discussion document\" for an upcoming meeting between Ernst &\n\nYoung, Hale and Dorr, the Cavallaros, their sons, Kevin McGillivary\n\n(an accountant working for Camelot), and David Frac of Camelot.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f          The letter explained that the IRS would scrutinize the\n\npre-merger values of Knight and Camelot to determine the proper\n\nallocation of the post-merger sale proceeds between the Cavallaros\nand their sons.    The pre-merger values were important because they\n\nwould be the benchmark for determining whether the Cavallaros had\n\ndisguised a gift to their sons in the form of post-merger stock\nand, if so, the size of that gift and the resulting transfer tax\n\nliability.      Ernst   &   Young   stated   that   the   pre-merger   profit\n\ndisparity between Knight and Camelot did not reflect the true\n\nvalues of the companies:\n\n             The current structure and resulting profit split does not\n             seem to reflect the economic reality of the business\n             arrangement. If one were to combine the entities, as\n             currently structured, approximately 70% of the profit is\n             earned by the Company that bears no risk with respect to\n             product development, has no employees, does not bear any\n             costs of sales, does not service or provide any warranty\n             coverage on the product or own any of the technology. In\n             a normal distributor relationship . . . . this\n             arrangement does not exist.\n\nThe IRS, Ernst & Young said, would likely attribute most of the\n\nvalue of the post-merger corporation to the Cavallaros, which would\n\ndefeat the tax saving goal of allocating most of the profits of the\npre-merger corporations to their sons.              The letter stated that\n\n\"[b]ased on the facts that exist today, it would be hard to justify\n\nCamelot taking more than a small amount of the allocated proceeds\"\n\nfrom a sale of the businesses.         More specifically, Ernst & Young\n\nsuggested that, upon merger, as much as 85% of the shares of the\n\nmerged entity would go to the Cavallaros, with only 15% of the\n\nshares going to their sons.\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f          It appears that the Cavallaros desired a post-merger\n\ndistribution more favorable to their sons, but that a post-merger\n\nredistribution would create significant transfer tax liability.\nErnst & Young proposed a solution.     Ernst & Young recommended a\n\n\"two step approach\" to \"eliminate[ ] the exposure related to\n\nreallocation of income.\" Step one was to merge Knight and Camelot.\nStep two \"involve[d] the gifting of stock in the merged entity by\n\n[the Cavallaros] to [their sons] in the amounts that would result\n\nin the desired ownership split.\"     Ernst & Young recommended that\n\nthe gifting be done using a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust.    This\n\ngifting was necessary, according to Ernst & Young, because of the\n\nreal pre-merger distribution of assets, which heavily favored\n\nKnight and the Cavallaros and disfavored Camelot and the sons.\n          Prior to December 19, 1994, the parties agree that Ernst\n\n& Young and Hale and Dorr were not working together or in a\n\ncoordinated fashion, even if each firm knew that the other was\nsomehow involved in advising the Cavallaros, their sons, or the\n\ncompanies.   On December 19, the Cavallaros, their sons, a Camelot\n\naccountant, accountants from Ernst & Young, and at least one lawyer\n\nfrom Hale and Dorr met as planned.     This meeting is important to\n\nthe case because the Cavallaros assert that, at this meeting,\n\n\"Ernst & Young began assisting Hale and Dorr with respect to\n\nproviding advice on transfer tax issues.\"   The Cavallaros say that\n\nErnst & Young continued in this role, as an assistant to Hale and\n\nDorr, through 1995.   At the meeting, neither Camelot nor the sons\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fwere represented by an attorney; Hale and Dorr represented only the\n\nCavallaros.\n\n                 It is unclear what happened next. As the IRS has stated,\nthis is, at least in part, what they are attempting to investigate\n\nby way of the challenged subpoena.                      What we do know is that the\n\nCavallaros did not follow Ernst & Young's December 15, 1994,\nrecommendations.             Instead, on May 23, 1995, Mr. Cavallaro and one\n\nof his sons signed affidavits that were at odds with Ernst &\n\nYoung's conclusion that \"it would be very hard to justify Camelot\n\ntaking more than a small amount of the allocated proceeds\" from a\n\nsale of the businesses.                Hale and Dorr, not Ernst & Young, prepared\n\nthese affidavits.              In these two separate, but nearly identical\n\naffidavits, Mr. Cavallaro and his son stated that Knight had\ntransferred,           for   no   compensation,         its   glue-dispensing       machine\n\ntechnology to Camelot when Camelot was formed in 1987. They stated\n\nthat,       at   the    time      of   the   transfer,        the    technology    \"had   no\nascertainable value,\" \"had no reasonable prospect of realizing a\n\nprofit,\" and was \"no more than a promising but raw idea.\"                               They\n\nstated that Camelot \"entirely redesigned the original dispensing\n\nproduct.\"         Knight and Camelot then supplemented these affidavits\n\nwith    a    confirmatory         bill    of    sale,    also       dated   May   23,   1995,\n\npurporting to confirm the previously undocumented gift from Knight\n\nto Camelot.            The Cavallaros say that Hale and Dorr had prepared\n\ndrafts of all of these documents before the December 19, 1994,\n\nmeeting.\n\n\n\n\n                                               -10-\n\f           This claimed, undocumented transfer was important to the\n\npre-merger valuation of the companies and hence to the correct\n\npost-merger distribution of shares.             On December 31, 1995, Knight\nmerged into Camelot.           As part of the merger, the Cavallaros\n\nreceived 19% of Camelot's stock.               This allocation was based on\n\nErnst & Young's December 31, 1995, valuation of the companies,\nwhich reflected the alleged, but undocumented, technology transfer.\n\nErnst & Young's December 1995 valuation, attributing most of the\n\nvalue of the post-merger corporation to Camelot, was at odds with\n\nits 1994 suggestion that Camelot shares would form only a small\n\npart of the post-merger corporation's value.            On July 1, 1996, the\n\nmerged corporation was sold for approximately $97 million.                    The\n\n1995    merger,   based   on     the    1995    valuation,    resulted   in     a\ndistribution of assets to the Cavallaros' sons that substantially\n\nreduced the Cavallaros' transfer tax liabilities.\n\n           Suspicious of these circumstances, the IRS began a tax\nfraud   investigation     into   the    Cavallaros'    correct    federal     tax\n\nliabilities for the years 1987 through 1996.                 The investigation\n\nfocused on whether the Cavallaros had manufactured a prior gift to\n\ntheir children, through the use of the alleged technology transfer,\n\nto avoid transfer taxes.          The IRS sought to determine whether\n\nKnight was undervalued and whether Camelot was overvalued at the\n\ntime of the merger because, if this were the case, then the\n\nCavallaros would have disguised a gift to their sons in the form of\n\npost-merger stock.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f             As part of this investigation, the IRS, on December 7,\n\n1999, issued a third-party recordkeeping summons to Ernst & Young.1\n\nThe summons began by requesting \"[a]ll records relating to [Ernst\n& Young's] engagements with William, Patricia, Paul, Kenneth, or\n\nJames Cavallaro[ ], Knight Tool . . . or Camelot Systems . . . at\n\nany time from 1984 through 1995.\"             The IRS issued the summons\nbecause, in response to a prior summons it had issued in the\n\ninvestigation, it had obtained a copy of the December 15, 1994,\n\nErnst    &   Young    letter,   which   it   believed   \"to    be   materially\n\ninconsistent with subsequent sworn statements made [by] William\n\nCavallaro and a subsequent valuation rendered by Ernst & Young.\"\n\nThe IRS stated that the 1994 valuation \"sets forth a pre-merger\n\nanalysis     which    is   materially   inconsistent    with    a   subsequent\nvaluation rendered by Ernst & Young . . . . [and] materially at\n\nodds with sworn statements submitted by William Cavallaro.\"\n\n             The Cavallaros moved to quash the summons as overly broad\nand calling     for    privileged   materials.     They   argued     that   the\n\nsummoned documents are privileged because Ernst & Young helped Hale\n\n\n     1\n          The IRS issued its summons under the authority granted by\n26 U.S.C. § 7602 (1994 & Supp. V 1999). That section states that\n\n             [f]or the purpose of . . . determining the liability of\n             any person for any internal revenue tax . . . the\n             Secretary is authorized -- (1) To examine any books,\n             papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or\n             material to such inquiry; [and] (2) To summon the person\n             . . . to appear before the Secretary . . . to produce\n             such books, papers, records, or other data, and to give\n             such testimony, under oath, as may be relevant or\n             material to such inquiry.\n\nId. § 7602(a) (1994).\n\n                                    -12-\n\fand Dorr provide legal advice beginning on December 19, 1994. They\n\nalso argued that the documents fall within the common-interest\n\nrule.\n             Subsequently, the Cavallaros provided the IRS with a\n\nsubstantial       number   of    documents,     including   excerpts       from   the\n\ndiaries of Ernst & Young employees who worked for Knight or Camelot\nand   what   the    Cavallaros     say    are   nearly   all    of     Knight's   and\n\nCamelot's accounting records. This dispute is over those remaining\n\ndocuments that the Cavallaros have refused to produce.\n\n             The IRS counterclaimed for enforcement of the summons.\n\nOn September 19, 2000, the district court heard arguments and\n\nauthorized the IRS to depose Lawrence Goodman, a senior manager in\n\nErnst & Young's tax department, primarily to determine whether any\nadditional documents existed relating to Ernst & Young's work for\n\nthe Cavallaros, their sons, and the two companies.                Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n30(b)(6).     After the deposition, Hale and Dorr provided the IRS\nwith an amended privilege log and a letter stating the reasons why\n\nit believed each of the documents in the log to be privileged.\n\n             On    July    27,   2001,    the    district      court    denied    the\n\nCavallaros' petition to quash and allowed the government's motion\n\nto enforce the summons.             Cavallaro, 153 F. Supp. 2d 52.                The\n\ndistrict court noted that the communications in question -- that\n\nis, those documents that the Cavallaros continued to assert were\n\nprivileged -- fell into three categories: \"(1) notes from the\n\nDecember 19, 1994 meeting addressing transfer tax issues; (2)\n\nfollow-up communications arising from the Dec. 19th meeting; and\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\f(3) subsequent communications addressing the merger of the two\n\ncompanies.\"     Id. at 56.        These same categories of documents remain\n\nat issue.2\n             The district court reasoned that the documents were not\n\nprivileged under Kovel, 296 F.2d 918, because the Cavallaros had\n\nfailed to demonstrate that one of the key elements of a Kovel\n\nprivilege was met: that is, the Cavallaros had not shown that Ernst\n\n& Young's role was to facilitate communications, between the\n\nCavallaros and Hale and Dorr, made for the purpose of obtaining\n\nlegal advice.       Cavallaro, 153 F. Supp. 2d at 58.              The \"case does\n\nnot fit into the Kovel paradigm,\" the district court held, because\n\nErnst & Young, at all times, acted as an agent of Camelot and the\n\nsons, not as an agent of Hale and Dorr or the Cavallaros.                  Id. at\n59.\n\n             As to the common-interest argument, the district court\n\nconcluded that, at the December 19, 1994, meeting, and going\nforward,     Hale   and    Dorr    represented     only   the   Cavallaros,     and\n\npossibly     Knight,      but   not   the   sons   or   Camelot.     Id.   at   61.\n\nTherefore, the district court held that, \"[u]nder the strict\n\n\n      2\n          With respect to the notes from the December 19 meeting\nand any follow-up communications arising from this meeting, the\nCavallaros state that they have already produced all of the\nrequested documents that Ernst & Young created. They say that all\nof the transfer tax documents still claimed as privileged were\neither created by Hale and Dorr or sent to Hale and Dorr by other\naccountants working for the family or their businesses, with one\nexception: a letter from David Frac of Camelot to Lawrence Goodman,\nan Ernst & Young senior manager, regarding preparation for a\nmeeting with Hale and Dorr.     With respect to category (3), the\nmerger, the Cavallaros say that several of the documents still\nwithheld were created by Ernst & Young.\n\n                                        -14-\n\fconfines    of    the      common-interest      doctrine,      the   lack    of\n\nrepresentation for the remaining parties vitiates any claim to a\n\nprivilege.\"      Id.     \"[B]ecause only one party to this purported\ncommon-interest        arrangement   was    represented   by   counsel,\"    the\n\ndistrict court held, \"there is no valid claim of privilege under\n\nthe common-interest doctrine.\"         Id. at 62.3\n\n                                      II.\n\n           \"On an appeal respecting a privilege claim, the standard\n\nof review depends on the issue.\"            United States v. Mass. Inst. of\n\nTech., 129 F.3d 681, 683 (1st Cir. 1997).          We review district court\nrulings on questions of law de novo; we review district court fact\n\nfindings for clear error; and we review \"discretionary judgments\nsuch as evidentiary rulings\" for abuse of discretion.                Id.    Here\nthe parties contest the formulation of both the Kovel doctrine and\n\nthe common-interest doctrine, legal questions which we review de\nnovo.    The parties also contest the district court's findings of\nfact. Indeed, the Cavallaros assert that \"the District Court found\n\nno facts,\" a claim which is an overstatement.\n           Neither the United States Constitution, nor any federal\nstatute, nor any Supreme Court rule governs the proper scope of the\n\nattorney-client privilege in this case. Nor does state law provide\nthe rule of decision.       Fed. R. Evid. 501 states that in such cases,\nthe issue \"shall be governed by the principles of the common law as\n\n\n\n     3\n          The district court did not address the government's\nargument that the documents fall under the crime-fraud exception.\nCavallaro, 153 F. Supp. 2d at 58 n.3.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fthey may be interpreted by the courts of the United States in the\n\nlight of reason and experience.\"\n\n          Before   discussing   exceptions   to   the   attorney-client\nprivilege, and exceptions to those exceptions, we first lay out the\n\nessential elements of the privilege, as described by Wigmore and\n\npreviously endorsed by this court:\n          (1) Where legal advice of any kind is sought (2) from a\n          professional legal adviser in his capacity as such, (3)\n          the communications relating to that purpose, (4) made in\n          confidence (5) by the client, (6) are at his instance\n          permanently protected (7) from disclosure by himself or\n          by the legal adviser, (8) except the protection be\n          waived.\n\n8 J.H. Wigmore, Evidence § 2292, at 554 (McNaughton rev. 1961),\n\nquoted in Mass. Inst. of Tech., 129 F.3d at 684.\n\n          The rationale for the privilege is that safeguarding\ncommunications between attorney and client encourages disclosures\n\nby the client to the lawyer that facilitate the client's compliance\n\nwith the law and better enable the client to present legitimate\narguments should litigation arise.     Mass. Inst. of Tech., 129 F.3d\n\nat 684.   The privilege is well established; indeed, it \"first\n\nappeared in the sixteenth century,\" P.R. Rice, Attorney-Client\n\nPrivilege in the United States § 1:1, at 6 (2d ed. 1999), and it is\n\n\"the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known\n\nto the common law,\" Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389\n\n(1981); see also Wigmore, supra, § 2290, at 542.        We note, but do\n\nnot rely on, the doctrine of construing the privilege narrowly,\n\nwhich has particular force in the context of IRS investigations\n\ngiven the \"congressional policy choice in favor of disclosure of\n\n\n                                -16-\n\fall information relevant to a legitimate IRS inquiry.\"4                United\n\nStates v. Arthur Young & Co., 465 U.S. 805, 816 (1984).               Even in\n\nother contexts, there is a more general reason for construing the\nattorney-client     privilege    narrowly:    the    belief    that    \"[t]he\n\ninvestigation of truth and the enforcement of testimonial duty\n\ndemand the restriction, not the expansion, of these privileges.\"\nWigmore, supra, § 2192, at 73; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena,\n\n274 F.3d 563, 571 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[T]he privilege applies only to\n\nthe extent necessary to achieve its underlying goal of ensuring\n\neffective representation through open communication between lawyer\n\nand client.\").\n\n           In    contrast   to   the   attorney-client       privilege,   \"no\n\nconfidential    accountant-client      privilege    exists    under   federal\nlaw.\"5   Couch v. United States, 409 U.S. 322, 335 (1973), quoted in\n\nArthur Young, 465 U.S. at 817; see also United States v. Arthur\n\nAndersen & Co., 623 F.2d 725, 729 (1st Cir. 1980) (declining to\ndepart from Couch's general rule).        The parties to this litigation\n\n     4\n           \"As a tool of discovery, the § 7602 summons is critical\nto the investigative and enforcement functions of the IRS.\" United\nStates v. Arthur Young & Co., 465 U.S. 805, 814 (1984).       While\n§ 7602 is \"subject to the traditional privileges,\" United States v.\nEuge, 444 U.S. 707, 714 (1980), we are cautious of \"recognizing\nexceptions to the broad summons authority of the IRS or in\nfashioning new privileges that would curtail disclosure under\n§ 7602\" absent clear congressional directions. Arthur Young, 465\nU.S. at 816-17.\n     5\n          In 1998, Congress established a limited privilege for\naccountant-client communications. Pub. L. No. 105-206, title III,\n§ 3411, 112 Stat. 685, 751 (codified at 26 U.S.C. § 7525 (Supp. V\n1999)). The privilege, however, applies only to communications\noccurring after July 22, 1998. Id. § 3411(c). Because all of the\ncommunications at issue occurred before this date, neither party\nargues that the statutory privilege applies here.\n\n                                   -17-\n\frecognize as much, but agree, correctly, that accountant-client\n\ncommunications    are   privileged   if   they     meet   the   traditional\n\nrequirements     of   the   attorney-client    privilege.       With   this\nfoundation laid, we turn to the Cavallaros' privilege claims.\n\n          The Cavallaros argue that the attorney-client privilege\n\nprotects the three categories of subpoenaed documents, all of which\nare in Ernst & Young's possession.            For a communication to be\n\ncovered by the attorney-client privilege, the communication must be\n\nmade in confidence.         Wigmore, supra, § 2292, at 554.        Another\n\nrequirement is that the privilege not be waived.          Id. The presence\n\nof third parties during an attorney-client communication is often\n\nsufficient to undermine the \"made in confidence\" requirement, 3\n\nWeinstein's Federal Evidence § 503.15[3] (J.M. McLaughlin, ed., 2d\ned. 2002), or to waive the privilege, E.S. Epstein, The Attorney-\n\nClient Privilege and the Work-Product Doctrine 168-69, 189 (4th ed.\n\n2001).\n          Here, however, the Cavallaros invoke two doctrines to\n\nsupport their claim that disclosing the subpoenaed documents to\nErnst & Young neither undermined the confidentiality requirement\n\nnor waived the privilege.      First, they say that the documents were\n\nall created or received by Ernst & Young after it began to assist\n\nHale and Dorr in rendering legal advice and so the documents fall\n\nunder the Kovel doctrine, which they characterize as holding that\n\nthe presence of some third parties that are \"necessary, or at least\n\nhighly useful,\" to facilitating attorney-client communication does\n\nnot destroy the privilege.      296 F.2d at 922.    Second, they say that\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthe documents fall within what they call the \"common-interest\n\nprivilege.\"     The Cavallaros bear the burden of establishing that\n\nthe attorney-client privilege is a defense to the enforcement of\nthe IRS's summons, but, if the privilege is established, the\n\ngovernment bears the burden of showing that the privilege is\n\ndefeated by an exception.     Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Ogden Corp.,\n\n202 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nA. Kovel\n\n            Generally, disclosing attorney-client communications to\n\na third party undermines the privilege.       United States v. Ackert,\n169 F.3d 136, 139 (2d Cir. 1999) (stating that \"the attorney-client\n\nprivilege generally applies only to communications between the\nattorney and the client\"); Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra, at\n\n§ 503.15[3]; Epstein, supra, at 168-69, 189.       An exception to this\n\ngeneral rule exists for third parties employed to assist a lawyer\nin rendering legal advice.         Sup. Ct. Standard 503; Weinstein's\n\nFederal Evidence, supra, at §§ 503.12[3][a] and [4][b].        In Kovel,\n\nthe Second Circuit held that, because \"the complexities of modern\nexistence prevent attorneys from effectively handling clients'\naffairs     without   the   help   of   others,\"   the   attorney-client\n\n\"'privilege must include all the persons who act as the attorney's\nagents.'\"     296 F.2d at 921 (quoting Wigmore, supra, § 2301, at\n\n583).6\n\n\n     6\n          We will assume arguendo that this circuit would adopt the\nKovel test or a similar standard, as so many other circuits have\ndone, but we need not decide the question. E.g., United States v.\nBornstein, 977 F.2d 112, 116-17 (4th Cir. 1992); United States v.\n\n                                   -19-\n\f          This logic applies to accountants: \"[T]he presence of an\n\naccountant, whether hired by the lawyer or by the client, while the\n\nclient is relating a complicated tax story to the lawyer, ought not\ndestroy the privilege\" when \"the accountant is necessary, or at\n\nleast highly useful, for the effective consultation between the\n\nclient and the lawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.\"\nId.   at 922.   The communication, however, must be made \"for the\n\npurpose of obtaining legal advice from the lawyer.\"   Id.   \"If what\n\nis sought is not legal advice but only accounting service . . . ,\n\nor if the advice sought is the accountant's rather than the\n\nlawyer's, no privilege exists.\"    Id.; see also United States v.\n\nAdlman, 68 F.3d 1495, 1500 (2d Cir. 1995).\n\n          The district court concluded that \"Kovel requires that\neither the Cavallaros, Knight, or Hale and Dorr hired Ernst & Young\n\nfor the purpose of facilitating a legal communication with Hale and\n\nDorr.\"   Cavallaro, 153 F. Supp. 2d at 57.       It said that the\nCavallaros must show that \"Ernst & Young was an agent of Hale and\n\nDorr, Knight or the Cavallaros.\"   Id. at 58.   We know that such a\n\nshowing is not sufficient to sustain the privilege: as the district\n\ncourt recognized, an attorney, merely by placing an accountant on\n\nher payroll, does not, by this action alone, render communications\n\n\n\n\nEl Paso Co., 682 F.2d 530, 541 (5th Cir. 1982); In re Grand Jury\nProceedings, 220 F.3d 568, 571 (7th Cir. 2000); United States v.\nCote, 456 F.2d 142, 144 (8th Cir. 1972); United States v. Judson,\n322 F.2d 460, 462-63 (9th Cir. 1963); Fed. Trade Comm'n v. TRW,\nInc., 628 F.2d 207, 212 (D.C. Cir. 1980).      See also Sup. Ct.\nStandard 503(b) and 503(a)(3).\n\n                               -20-\n\fbetween the attorney's client and the accountant privileged.7               Id.\n\nat 57; Kovel, 296 F.2d at 921.         We need not reach the question of\n\nwhether such a showing is necessary.               That is, we need not\ndetermine whether, in all instances, the attorney or client (as\n\nopposed to some third party) must hire the accountant in order to\n\nsustain a privilege under Kovel.\n\n            Here, the record does not show that any party hired Ernst\n\n& Young to assist Hale and Dorr in providing legal advice, and we\n\nnote that the agency relationship between the parties is relevant\n\nto, but not dispositive of, this question.          Kovel requires that to\n\nsustain a privilege an accountant must be \"necessary, or at least\n\nhighly useful, for the effective consultation between the client\n\nand the lawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.\"               Kovel,\n296 F.2d at 922.         This requirement resolves the Kovel dispute\n\nbecause the evidence shows that Ernst & Young was not employed for\n\nthis purpose.\n            Whether Hale and Dorr, as opposed to the Cavallaros or\n\ntheir    sons,   hired   Ernst   &   Young   is,   as   the   district   court\nrecognized, probative when considering whether Ernst & Young was\n\nemployed to help Hale and Dorr render legal advice.               Typically,\n\n\"[a]gents of an attorney are . . . retained by or at the discretion\n\nof the attorney and under the attorney's supervision.\"                    Rice,\n\n\n     7\n          Accordingly, were the Cavallaros to show that they\nemployed Ernst & Young, or that Knight or Hale and Dorr did so,\nthis alone would be insufficient to bring the disputed\ncommunications within Kovel. See United States v. Gurtner, 474\nF.2d 297, 299 (9th Cir. 1973) (stating that not all consultations\nwith accountants, acting as attorneys' agents, are privileged).\n\n                                     -21-\n\fsupra, § 3:5, at 30.     Here, the bulk of the evidence supports the\n\nclaim that, at the December 1994 meeting, and going forward, Ernst\n\n& Young acted as an agent for the sons or Camelot, but not for Hale\nand Dorr, the Cavallaros, or Knight.\n\n             No one disputes that Camelot initially hired Ernst &\n\nYoung.    Only one month prior to the December 1994 meeting, Ernst &\nYoung sent Camelot a letter of engagement stating that \"[a]ll\n\nadvice and other services we provide pursuant to this engagement\n\nare solely for the benefit of Camelot . . . and are not for the\n\nbenefit of anyone other than the corporation and its shareholders.\"\n\nCamelot's CFO, David Frac, signed the letter and returned it to\n\nErnst & Young.     Everyone also agrees that Camelot hired Ernst &\n\nYoung to provide financial advice, not to assist any lawyers.\nPrior to the December 1994 meeting, Ernst & Young was not in any\n\nway coordinating its accounting advice with Hale and Dorr's legal\n\nadvice.\n             The Cavallaros say that things changed at the December\n\n1994 meeting.     At that meeting, they say, it was \"clear to all\n\nparties\" that \"Ernst & Young began assisting Hale and Dorr with\n\nrespect to providing advice on transfer tax issues.\"          They claim\n\nthat Ernst & Young continued in this role, as an assistant to Hale\n\nand Dorr on transfer tax and, later, merger issues, through 1995.\n\nMore specifically, the Cavallaros argue that Ernst & Young assisted\n\nHale and Dorr in providing legal advice, and improved that advice,\n\nby, \"[a]mong other things, . . . review[ing] the factual basis of\n\nHale   and   Dorr's   analysis   to   help   determine   whether   it   was\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fconsistent with the accounting records that Ernst & Young had\n\nreviewed.\"    The district court properly rejected the argument.\n\n          The district court found that \"[t]he Cavallaros have not\nproduced any contemporaneous documentation to suggest that, as of\n\nDecember 19, 1994, Ernst & Young's professional relationship with\n\nthe Cavallaro parents changed in a way that would trigger a\nprivilege.\"   Cavallaro, 153 F. Supp. 2d at 59.   The Cavallaros urge\n\nthat the district court overlooked some evidence.    First, that the\n\nbill for Ernst & Young's services rendered through December 31,\n\n1994, refers to services rendered to both Camelot and Knight.\n\nSecond, that Ernst & Young mailed this bill to Mrs. Cavallaro at\n\nKnight.   Third, that Lawrence Goodman testified that, in 1994,\n\nErnst & Young was involved in providing tax advice to Camelot,\nKnight, and the Cavallaros.    The district court did not mention\n\nthis evidence, but it does not change the outcome here.    None of it\n\nis \"contemporaneous documentation\" of the relationship between the\nparties at the meeting.     The bill was presumably drafted after\n\nservices were rendered.    The parties never formally commemorated\n\nthis purportedly changed relationship. Mr. Goodman's statement was\n\nmade after the fact, in the midst of litigation, with little\n\nsupport in the contemporaneous record.   The district court did not\n\nclearly err when it found as it did.\n\n          But all of this is slightly off-topic.          The agency\n\nquestion aside, the evidence is strong that Ernst & Young acted to\n\nprovide accounting advice rather than to assist Hale and Dorr in\n\nproviding legal advice. Cf. United States v. Judson, 322 F.2d 460,\n\n\n                                -23-\n\f462-63 (9th Cir. 1963) (Kovel exception covers documents created by\n\nan accountant at an attorney's request for the purpose of advising\n\nand defending the client).        Prior to the December 1994 meeting,\nErnst & Young provided accounting advice to Camelot independent of\n\nHale and Dorr.    After that meeting, the evidence supports the\n\nconclusion that Ernst & Young and Hale and Dorr continued to work\non their respective, separate tracks, albeit in a more coordinated\n\nway.\n\n          We are skeptical of the Cavallaros' claim that Ernst &\n\nYoung was present to assist attorney Hamel of Hale and Dorr, who\n\nwas a senior partner of over twenty years' experience, and a\n\nspecialist   in   trusts    and    estates,   including,   necessarily,\n\nconsequent tax advice.     Recognizing that an attorney's experience\nalone is not prima facie evidence that an accountant was not\n\n\"necessary, or at least highly useful,\" Kovel, 296 F.2d at 922, to\n\nthe lawyer in providing legal assistance, we note that when a party\nhires an accountant to provide accounting advice, and only later\n\nhires an attorney to provide legal advice, it is particularly\nimportant for the party to show that the accountant later acted as\n\nan agent necessary to the lawyer in providing legal advice.         See\n\nRice, supra, § 3:5, at 33-34 (noting that \"when the client has\n\npreviously employed the agent independent of the attorney-client\n\nrelationship, to perform the same services that he will perform for\n\nthe attorney[,]. . . . [t]his creates a risk that the agent's\n\nretention by the attorney is simply a subterfuge\"); id. at 35 n.66\n\n(citing Swarthmore Radiation Oncology, Inc. v. Lapes, No. 92-3055,\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\f1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1970, at *9-12 (E.D. Pa. Feb. 18, 1994)).\n\nThe Cavallaros have failed to make a sufficient showing here.\n\n          Contrary to the Cavallaros' assertion that a mere finding\nthat an account was \"useful\" is all that is required under Kovel,\n\n\"[t]he available case law indicates that the 'necessity' element\n\nmeans more than just useful and convenient. The involvement of the\nthird party must be nearly indispensable or serve some specialized\n\npurpose in facilitating the attorney-client communications.            Mere\n\nconvenience is not sufficient.\"              Epstein, supra, at 187.   The\n\nCavallaros' claim that Ernst & Young \"had the capacity to benefit\n\nthe quality of the legal advice that Hale and Dorr would render\"\n\nand that, \"[a]mong other things,\" Ernst & Young double-checked Hale\n\nand Dorr's legal advice to make sure \"it was consistent with the\naccounting records that Ernst & Young had reviewed\" is not enough\n\nto show that Ernst & Young was necessary, or at least highly\n\nuseful, in facilitating Hale and Dorr's provision of legal advice.\nThat ends the matter.\n\nB. Common Interest\n\n             The common-interest doctrine is typically understood to\napply \"[w]hen two or more clients consult or retain an attorney on\n\nparticular    matters   of   common    interest.\"     Weinstein's   Federal\n\nEvidence, supra, § 503.21[1]; Wigmore, supra, § 2312, at 603-09.\nIn such a situation, \"the communications between each of them and\n\nthe attorney are privileged against third parties.\"            Weinstein's\n\nFederal Evidence, supra, § 503.21[1]; see also In re Grand Jury\n\nSubpoena, 274 F.3d at 573; Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., 202 F.3d at\n\n                                      -25-\n\f461.   Similarly, the \"privilege applies to communications made by\n\nthe client or the client's 'lawyer to a lawyer representing another\n\nin a matter of common interest.'\"      Weinstein's Federal Evidence,\nsupra, § 503.21[2] (quoting Sup. Ct. Standard 503(b)(3)).\n\n          Whether one refers to either or both of these instances\n\nas \"common interest,\" \"joint defense,\" \"joint client,\" or \"allied\nlawyer\" doctrines does not change the outcome of this case.      The\n\ncommon-interest doctrine, like the rule announced in Kovel, is \"not\n\nan independent basis for privilege, but an exception to the general\n\nrule that the attorney-client privilege is waived when privileged\n\ninformation is disclosed to a third party.\"      Epstein, supra, at\n\n196.\n\n           Our resolution of the Cavallaros' Kovel argument resolves\ntheir common-interest claim as well.     Although the district court\n\ndirected its inquiry toward the alignment of interests between all\n\nof the parties in the case and then decided that, \"[e]ven if there\nwere a sufficient commonality of interest, . . . . [u]nder the\n\nstrict confines of the common-interest doctrine, the lack of\n\nrepresentation for [the sons and Camelot] vitiates any claim to a\n\nprivilege,\" 153 F. Supp. 2d at 60, we do not need to reach these\n\nissues.\n\n          Ernst & Young was not covered by the attorney-client\n\nrelationship between Hale and Dorr and its clients.     Even if the\n\nCavallaros, their sons, and their respective companies all had an\n\nexact unanimity of interest, it would not render communications\n\ncreated by or shared with Ernst & Young privileged when Ernst &\n\n\n                                -26-\n\fYoung     was     providing       accounting      services,       not     facilitating\n\ncommunication       of    legal    advice    between     Hale    and    Dorr   and    its\n\nclients.\n            The     common-interest         doctrine      prevents       clients     from\n\nwaiving     the     attorney-client         privilege      when       attorney-client\n\ncommunications are shared with a third person who has a common\nlegal interest with respect to these communications, for instance,\n\na codefendant. The doctrine does not extend to prevent waiver when\n\nan accountant, not within the Kovel doctrine, is made privy to the\n\nattorney-client          communications.          In    such     an     instance,    the\n\naccountant does not share an interest in receiving legal advice\n\nfrom the lawyer and cannot logically be said to have an interest in\n\ncommon with the represented party or parties. Under Kovel, we know\nthat when a client, a lawyer, and an accountant are present, the\n\naccountant's presence will destroy the privilege if the accountant\n\nis not \"necessary, or at least highly useful, for the effective\nconsultation between the client and the lawyer.\"                      296 F.2d at 922.\n\nIt follows that the client -- in this case the Cavallaros -- cannot\n\nresurrect the privilege by adding another party (their sons) and\n\nthat party's accountant to the mix.               This is true even if the sons\n\nshare a common interest with the parents.                 To hold otherwise would\n\nbe   to   create    a     loophole    in    Kovel      whereby   the     privilege     is\n\nundermined when a client and his attorney disclose information to\n\nan accountant who is not \"necessary, or at least highly useful, for\n\nthe effective consultation between the client and the lawyer,\" 296\n\nF.2d at 922, but the privilege is preserved when the client brings\n\n\n                                           -27-\n\fanother party with a common interest on board and that other\n\nparty's accountant is present.\n\n          The   Cavallaros'    argument   that   every   party   to   the\ncommunication need not have his own lawyer in order for the common-\n\ninterest doctrine to apply, although relevant to the district\n\ncourt's reasoning, is in the end beside the point, whether or not\nthe argument is valid.   Our conclusion that the documents are not\n\nprivileged under Kovel resolves the common-interest claim because\n\nthe common-interest rule presumes a valid underlying privilege.\n\nThere is no valid underlying privilege here because, by having\n\ndiscussions with, and disclosing the documents to, Ernst & Young,\n\nan accounting firm not necessary to permit Hale and Dorr to\n\ncommunicate legal advice to its client, the Cavallaros either\nwaived the attorney-client privilege or undermined the privilege's\n\nconfidentiality requirement.    One cannot create a privilege, where\n\npreviously there was none, simply by introducing a third party\n(with or without a common interest) into the circle within which\n\ndocuments are shared.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          For these reasons, the district court's judgment, denying\n\nthe Cavallaros' motion to quash the summons and allowing the United\nStates's motion to enforce the summons, is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f",

William and Patricia Cavallaro (\"Cavallaros\") owned Knight Tool Co., Inc., founded in 1976. Their adult sons owned Camelot Systems, Inc., created in 1987. The Cavallaros and their sons merged their respective corporations in 1995 and, on July 1, 1996, the merged entity sold for approximately $97 million. Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service began an investigation into the Cavallaros' correct estate and gift tax (\"transfer tax\") liabilities. The IRS suspected that the parties might have undervalued the Cavallaros' Knight company and overvalued the sons' Camelot company to disguise a gift to the sons in the form of post-merger stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of this investigation, the IRS served a summons on Ernst &amp; Young, an accounting firm that Camelot had retained in June of 1994. The summons requested that Ernst &amp; Young produce \"all records\" in its possession regarding any work it did between 1984 and 1995 for the Cavallaros, their sons, and their respective corporations. The Cavallaros moved to quash the summons as overly broad and calling for privileged materials. They argued that the documents in Ernst &amp; Young's possession were protected by the attorney-client privilege because the documents were created by, or provided to, Ernst &amp; Young in the course of the efforts of the law firm Hale and Dorr to provide legal advice; particularly, advice sought in 1994 and 1995 concerning transfer tax and merger issues arising from the close relationship between Camelot and Knight. The IRS counterclaimed for enforcement of the summons. On July 27, 2001, the district court denied the Cavallaros' petition to quash and allowed the government's motion to enforce the summons. <i>Cavallaro v. United States,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d 52 (D.Mass.2001). Subsequently, the district court granted the Cavallaros' motion for stay pending appeal, thereby permitting the Cavallaros to continue to refrain from disclosing the documents that they allege are privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in the district court proceedings, three categories of documents requested by the IRS are at issue: (1) documents pertaining to the December 19, 1994, meeting &#8212; between the Cavallaros, their sons, a Camelot accountant, accountants from Ernst &amp; Young, and at least one lawyer from Hale and Dorr &#8212; addressing transfer tax issues; (2) subsequent transfer tax communications arising from the December 19 meeting; and (3) documents related to communications addressing the 1995 merger of Knight and Camelot. All of the requested documents are in Ernst &amp; Young's possession. They are all documents either created by Ernst &amp; Young or transmitted to Ernst &amp; Young, not documents preserved solely in Hale and Dorr's files.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, as in the district court, the Cavallaros argue that these documents are privileged under <i>United States v. Kovel,</i> 296 F.2d 918 (2d Cir.1961), despite having been either created by or disclosed to Ernst &amp; Young, because Ernst &amp; Young aided Hale and Dorr in providing legal advice. They also argue that the documents fall within the common-interest exception to the rule that disclosure to a third party waives the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that this circuit would adopt the <i>Kovel</i> rule, we conclude that the documents are not privileged. We follow somewhat different reasoning than the district court. We need not decide whether, in all instances, the attorney or client (as opposed to some third party) must hire the accountant in order to sustain a privilege under <i>Kovel. Kovel</i> requires that to sustain a privilege an accountant must be \"necessary, or at least highly useful, for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.\" 296 F.2d at 922. Here, no party hired Ernst &amp; Young for this purpose. Therefore, the attorney-client privilege did not extend to the documents in question under the <i>Kovel</i> doctrine. Having found that the documents were not covered by the attorney-client privilege, we also conclude that they cannot fall within the common-interest exception, which presumes a valid underlying privilege in the first place. Consequently, we do not reach the district court's conclusion that \"[u]nder the strict confines of the common-interest doctrine, the lack of representation for [the sons and Camelot] vitiates any claim to a privilege,\" <i>Cavallaro,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 61, because Ernst &amp; Young was providing accounting services and so the <i>Kovel</i> extension of the privilege is inapplicable to the summoned documents, all of which were created by or disclosed to Ernst &amp; Young.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed except where otherwise noted. In 1976, the Cavallaros formed Knight Tool Co., Inc., to manufacture tools to be used by companies such as McDonnell Douglas, Polaroid, and Raytheon to assemble their products. Seven years later, in 1983, William Cavallaro and one of his three sons, Kenneth, developed a rudimentary glue-dispensing machine, which, for several years, was commercially unsuccessful due, at least in part, to difficulty in marketing the machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, the Cavallaros formed a new company, Camelot Systems, Inc., to give the Cavallaros' three sons an opportunity to pursue the glue-dispensing machine business. In addition to paying its own employees, Knight paid the salaries of Camelot's employees. The three sons were named as Camelot's sole shareholders and, although Knight continued to make the glue-dispensing machines, Camelot became the machines' only distributor. Knight was Camelot's biggest supplier. In fact, Camelot's only business was selling glue-dispensing machines and accessories manufactured by Knight. The sons, working at Camelot, completely redesigned the Knight glue-dispensing machine and developed several new models of the machine. As a result, Camelot became a lucrative business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, the Cavallaros contacted attorney Louis Hamel Jr. Hamel was a long-time senior partner at the Hale and Dorr law firm, specializing in trusts and estates, exempt organizations, and pensions. He, along with other Hale and Dorr attorneys, periodically counseled the Cavallaros regarding Knight corporate matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cavallaros again contacted Hamel, in October 1994, this time for help with estate and retirement planning. Hamel considered, among other things, potential transfer tax issues arising in the context of the close business and family relationships between Knight and Camelot. Between December 19, 1994, and December 31, 1995, Hale and Dorr provided legal advice to Knight and the Cavallaros, acting on Knight's behalf, with respect to the merger of Knight into Camelot. Hale and Dorr advised the Cavallaros on, among other things, the drafting of affidavits purporting to establish the pre-merger values of Knight and Camelot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Cavallaros were receiving legal advice from Hale and Dorr, their sons, as agents of Camelot, had begun receiving tax planning advice from Ernst &amp; Young. Camelot began meeting with Ernst &amp; Young in June of 1994. On November 16, 1994, Ernst &amp; Young documented its relationship with Camelot in a letter of engagement, stating that Ernst &amp; Young would be providing a \"Review of Corporate Structure and Recommendations,\" a \"Tax Checkup,\" and \"Transfer Planning.\" The letter, addressed to David Frac, Camelot's Chief Financial Officer, further stated that \"[a]ll advice and other services we provide pursuant to this engagement are solely for the benefit of Camelot ... and not for the benefit of anyone other than the corporation and its shareholders.\" Frac signed the letter and returned it to Ernst &amp; Young.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A draft of the invoice, however, for Ernst &amp; Young's services rendered through December 31, 1994, which explicitly included tax services rendered pursuant to the November 14 engagement letter, refers to services rendered to both Camelot <i>and</i> Knight. It was addressed and mailed to Mrs. Cavallaro at Knight. In addition, Lawrence Goodman, of Ernst &amp; Young, testified in his October 27, 2000, deposition that, in 1994, he was involved in providing tax advice to Camelot, Knight, and the Cavallaros. He also testified that around November or December of 1995, an Ernst &amp; Young employee began providing services to both Camelot and Knight. The district court, nonetheless, concluded that \"the undisputed evidence is that Ernst &amp; Young was paid by, and worked solely for, Camelot and its shareholders.\" <i>Cavallaro,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, 1994, Ernst &amp; Young sent a letter to William Cavallaro recommending the merger of Knight and Camelot and suggesting a strategy for minimizing transfer tax liability. Ernst &amp; Young understood that the Cavallaros and their sons would consider selling their respective companies, and proceeded to explain how the parties might structure the corporate relationship in order to facilitate a transfer of some of the proceeds from such a sale from the Cavallaros to their children while minimizing tax liability. Ernst &amp; Young stated that the letter would \"serve as the discussion document\" for an upcoming meeting between Ernst &amp; Young, Hale and Dorr, the Cavallaros, their sons, Kevin McGillivary (an accountant working for Camelot), and David Frac of Camelot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter explained that the IRS would scrutinize the pre-merger values of Knight and Camelot to determine the proper allocation of the post-merger sale proceeds between the Cavallaros and their sons. The pre-merger values were important because they would be the benchmark for determining whether the Cavallaros had disguised a gift to their sons in the form of post-merger stock and, if so, the size of that gift and the resulting transfer tax liability. Ernst &amp; Young stated that the pre-merger profit disparity between Knight and Camelot did not reflect the true values of the companies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current structure and resulting profit split does not seem to reflect the economic reality of the business arrangement. If one were to combine the entities, as currently structured, approximately 70% of the profit is earned by the Company that bears no risk with respect to product development, has no employees, does not bear any costs of sales, does not service or provide any warranty coverage on the product or own any of the technology. In a normal distributor relationship .... this arrangement does not exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS, Ernst &amp; Young said, would likely attribute most of the value of the post-merger corporation to the Cavallaros, which would defeat the tax saving goal of allocating most of the profits of the pre-merger corporations to their sons. The letter stated that \"[b]ased on the facts that exist today, it would be hard to justify Camelot taking more than a small amount of the allocated proceeds\" from a sale of the businesses. More specifically, Ernst &amp; Young suggested that, upon merger, as much as 85% of the shares of the merged entity would go to the Cavallaros, with only 15% of the shares going to their sons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that the Cavallaros desired a post-merger distribution more favorable to their sons, but that a post-merger redistribution would create significant transfer tax liability. Ernst &amp; Young proposed a solution. Ernst &amp; Young recommended a \"two step approach\" to \"eliminate[] the exposure related to reallocation of income.\" Step one was to merge Knight and Camelot. Step two \"involve[d] the gifting of stock in the merged entity by [the Cavallaros] to [their sons] in the amounts that would result in the desired ownership split.\" Ernst &amp; Young recommended that the gifting be done using a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust. This gifting was necessary, according to Ernst &amp; Young, because of the real pre-merger distribution of assets, which heavily favored Knight and the Cavallaros and disfavored Camelot and the sons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to December 19, 1994, the parties agree that Ernst &amp; Young and Hale and Dorr were not working together or in a coordinated fashion, even if each firm knew that the other was somehow involved in advising the Cavallaros, their sons, or the companies. On December 19, the Cavallaros, their sons, a Camelot accountant, accountants from Ernst &amp; Young, and at least one lawyer from Hale and Dorr met as planned. This meeting is important to the case because the Cavallaros assert that, at this meeting, \"Ernst &amp; Young began assisting Hale and Dorr with respect to providing advice on transfer tax issues.\" The Cavallaros say that Ernst &amp; Young continued in this role, as an assistant to Hale and Dorr, through 1995. At the meeting, neither Camelot nor the sons were represented by an attorney; Hale and Dorr represented only the Cavallaros.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear what happened next. As the IRS has stated, this is, at least in part, what they are attempting to investigate by way of the challenged subpoena. What we do know is that the Cavallaros did not follow Ernst &amp; Young's December 15, 1994, recommendations. Instead, on May 23, 1995, Mr. Cavallaro and one of his sons signed affidavits that were at odds with Ernst &amp; Young's conclusion that \"it would be very hard to justify Camelot taking more than a small amount of the allocated proceeds\" from a sale of the businesses. Hale and Dorr, not Ernst &amp; Young, prepared these affidavits. In these two separate, but nearly identical affidavits, Mr. Cavallaro and his son stated that Knight had transferred, for no compensation, its glue-dispensing machine technology to Camelot when Camelot was formed in 1987. They stated that, at the time of the transfer, the technology \"had no ascertainable value,\" \"had no reasonable prospect of realizing a profit,\" and was \"no more than a promising but raw idea.\" They stated that Camelot \"entirely redesigned the original dispensing product.\" Knight and Camelot then supplemented these affidavits with a confirmatory bill of sale, also dated May 23, 1995, purporting to confirm the previously undocumented gift from Knight to Camelot. The Cavallaros say that Hale and Dorr had prepared drafts of all of these documents before the December 19, 1994, meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claimed, undocumented transfer was important to the pre-merger valuation of the companies and hence to the correct post-merger distribution of shares. On December 31, 1995, Knight merged into Camelot. As part of the merger, the Cavallaros received 19% of Camelot's stock. This allocation was based on Ernst &amp; Young's December 31, 1995, valuation of the companies, which reflected the alleged, but undocumented, technology transfer. Ernst &amp; Young's December 1995 valuation, attributing most of the value of the post-merger corporation to Camelot, was at odds with its 1994 suggestion that Camelot shares would form only a small part of the post-merger corporation's value. On July 1, 1996, the merged corporation was sold for approximately $97 million. The 1995 merger, based on the 1995 valuation, resulted in a distribution of assets to the Cavallaros' sons that substantially reduced the Cavallaros' transfer tax liabilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suspicious of these circumstances, the IRS began a tax fraud investigation into the Cavallaros' correct federal tax liabilities for the years 1987 through 1996. The investigation focused on whether the Cavallaros had manufactured a prior gift to their children, through the use of the alleged technology transfer, to avoid transfer taxes. The IRS sought to determine whether Knight was undervalued and whether Camelot was overvalued at the time of the merger because, if this were the case, then the Cavallaros would have disguised a gift to their sons in the form of post-merger stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of this investigation, the IRS, on December 7, 1999, issued a third-party recordkeeping summons to Ernst &amp; Young.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The summons began by requesting \"[a]ll records relating to [Ernst &amp; Young's] engagements with William, Patricia, Paul, Kenneth, or James Cavallaro[], Knight Tool ... or Camelot Systems ... at any time from 1984 through 1995.\" The IRS issued the summons because, in response to a prior summons it had issued in the investigation, it had obtained a copy of the December 15, 1994, Ernst &amp; Young letter, which it believed \"to be materially inconsistent with subsequent sworn statements made [by] William Cavallaro and a subsequent valuation rendered by Ernst &amp; Young.\" The IRS stated that the 1994 valuation \"sets forth a pre-merger analysis which is materially inconsistent with a subsequent valuation rendered by Ernst &amp; Young .... [and] materially at odds with sworn statements submitted by William Cavallaro.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cavallaros moved to quash the summons as overly broad and calling for privileged materials. They argued that the summoned documents are privileged because Ernst &amp; Young helped Hale and Dorr provide legal advice beginning on December 19, 1994. They also argued that the documents fall within the common-interest rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the Cavallaros provided the IRS with a substantial number of documents, including excerpts from the diaries of Ernst &amp; Young employees who worked for Knight or Camelot and what the Cavallaros say are nearly all of Knight's and Camelot's accounting records. This dispute is over those remaining documents that the Cavallaros have refused to produce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS counterclaimed for enforcement of the summons. On September 19, 2000, the district court heard arguments and authorized the IRS to depose Lawrence Goodman, a senior manager in Ernst &amp; Young's tax department, primarily to determine whether any additional documents existed relating to Ernst &amp; Young's work for the Cavallaros, their sons, and the two companies. Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6). After the deposition, Hale and Dorr provided the IRS with an amended privilege log and a letter stating the reasons why it believed each of the documents in the log to be privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 2001, the district court denied the Cavallaros' petition to quash and allowed the government's motion to enforce the summons. <i>Cavallaro,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d 52. The district court noted that the communications in question &#8212; that is, those documents that the Cavallaros continued to assert were privileged &#8212; fell into three categories: \"(1) notes from the December 19, 1994 meeting addressing transfer tax issues; (2) follow-up communications arising from the Dec. 19th meeting; and (3) subsequent communications addressing the merger of the two companies.\" <i>Id.</i> at 56. These same categories of documents remain at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court reasoned that the documents were not privileged under <i>Kovel,</i> 296 F.2d 918, because the Cavallaros had failed to demonstrate that one of the key elements of a <i>Kovel</i> privilege was met: that is, the Cavallaros had not shown that Ernst &amp; Young's role was to facilitate communications, between the Cavallaros and Hale and Dorr, made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. <i>Cavallaro,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 58. The \"case does not fit into the <i>Kovel</i> paradigm,\" the district court held, because Ernst &amp; Young, at all times, acted as an agent of Camelot and the sons, not as an agent of Hale and Dorr or the Cavallaros. <i>Id.</i> at 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the common-interest argument, the district court concluded that, at the December 19, 1994, meeting, and going forward, Hale and Dorr represented only the Cavallaros, and possibly Knight, but not the sons or Camelot. <i>Id.</i> at 61. Therefore, the district court held that, \"[u]nder the strict confines of the common-interest doctrine, the lack of representation for the remaining parties vitiates any claim to a privilege.\" <i>Id.</i> \"[B]ecause only one party to this purported common-interest arrangement was represented by counsel,\" the district court held, \"there is no valid claim of privilege under the common-interest doctrine.\" <i>Id.</i> at 62.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"On an appeal respecting a privilege claim, the standard of review depends on the issue.\" <i>United States v.

We review district court rulings on questions of law de novo; we review district court fact findings for clear error; and we review \"discretionary judgments such as evidentiary rulings\" for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> Here the parties contest the formulation of both the <i>Kovel</i> doctrine and the common-interest doctrine, legal questions which we review de novo.

Wigmore, <i>Evidence</i> &#167; 2292, at 554 (McNaughton rev.1961), <i>quoted in Mass.

Inst. of Tech.,</i> 129 F.3d at 684. The privilege is well established; indeed, it \"first appeared in the sixteenth century,\" P.R. Rice, <i>Attorney-Client Privilege in the United States</i> &#167; 1:1, at 6 (2d ed.1999), and it is \"the oldest of the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law,\" <i>Upjohn Co. v.

We note, but do not rely on, the doctrine of construing the privilege narrowly, which has particular force in the context of IRS investigations given the \"congressional policy choice <i>in favor of disclosure</i> of all information relevant to a legitimate IRS inquiry.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>United</i> <i>States v. Arthur Young &amp; Co.,</i> 465 U.S. 805, 816, 104 S.Ct. 1495, 79 L.Ed.2d 826 (1984). Even in other contexts, there is a more general reason for construing the attorney-client privilege narrowly: the belief that \"[t]he investigation of truth and the enforcement of testimonial duty demand the restriction, not the expansion, of these privileges.\" Wigmore, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2192, at 73; <i>see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena,</i> 274 F.3d 563, 571 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[T]he privilege applies only to the extent necessary to achieve its underlying goal of ensuring effective representation through open communication between lawyer and client.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the attorney-client privilege, \"no confidential accountant-client privilege exists under federal law.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>Couch v. United States,</i> 409 U.S. 322, 335, 93 S.Ct. 611, 34 L.Ed.2d 548 (1973), <i>quoted in Arthur Young,</i> 465 U.S. at 817, 104 S.Ct. 1495; <i>see also United States v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.,</i> 623 F.2d 725, 729 (1st Cir.1980) (declining to depart from <i>Couch</i>'s general rule). The parties to this litigation recognize as much, but agree, correctly, that accountant-client communications are privileged if they meet the traditional requirements of the attorney-client privilege. With this foundation laid, we turn to the Cavallaros' privilege claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cavallaros argue that the attorney-client privilege protects the three categories of subpoenaed documents, all of which are in Ernst &amp; Young's possession. For a communication to be covered by the attorney-client privilege, the communication must be made in confidence. Wigmore, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2292, at 554. Another requirement is that the privilege not be waived. <i>Id.</i> The presence of third parties during an attorney-client communication is often sufficient to undermine the \"made in confidence\" requirement, 3 <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence</i> &#167; 503.15[3] (J.M. McLaughlin, ed., 2d ed.2002), or to waive the privilege, E.S. Epstein, <i>The Attorney-Client Privilege and the Work-Product Doctrine</i> 168-69, 189 (4th ed.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the Cavallaros invoke two doctrines to support their claim that disclosing the subpoenaed documents to Ernst &amp; Young neither undermined the confidentiality requirement nor waived the privilege. First, they say that the documents were all created or received by Ernst &amp; Young after it began to assist Hale and Dorr in rendering legal advice and so the documents fall under the <i>Kovel</i> doctrine, which they characterize as holding that the presence of some third parties that are \"necessary, or at least highly useful,\" to facilitating attorney-client communication does not destroy the privilege. 296 F.2d at 922. Second, they say that the documents fall within what they call the \"common-interest privilege.\" The Cavallaros bear the burden of establishing that the attorney-client privilege is a defense to the enforcement of the IRS's summons, but, if the privilege is established, the government bears the burden of showing that the privilege is defeated by an exception. <i>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Ogden Corp.,</i> 202 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Kovel</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, disclosing attorney-client communications to a third party undermines the privilege. <i>United States v. Ackert,</i> 169 F.3d 136, 139 (2d Cir.1999) (stating that \"the attorney-client privilege generally applies only to communications between the attorney and the client\"); <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra,</i> at &#167; 503.15[3]; Epstein, <i>supra,</i> at 168-69, 189. An exception to this general rule exists for third parties employed to assist a lawyer in rendering legal advice. Sup. Ct. Standard 503; <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra,</i> at &#167;&#167; 503.12[3][a] and [4][b]. In <i>Kovel,</i> the Second Circuit held that, because \"the complexities of modern existence prevent attorneys from effectively handling clients' affairs without the help of others,\" the attorney-client \"`privilege must include all the persons who act as the attorney's agents.'\" 296 F.2d at 921 (quoting Wigmore, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2301, at 583).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This logic applies to accountants: \"[T]he presence of an accountant, whether hired by the lawyer or by the client, while the client is relating a complicated tax story to the lawyer, ought not destroy the privilege\" when \"the accountant is necessary, or at least highly useful, for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.\" <i>Id.</i> at 922. The communication, however, must be made \"for the purpose of obtaining legal advice from the lawyer.\" <i>Id.</i> \"If what is sought is not legal advice but only accounting service..., or if the advice sought is the accountant's rather than the lawyer's, no privilege exists.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v. Adlman,</i> 68 F.3d 1495, 1500 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that \"<i>Kovel</i> requires that either the Cavallaros, Knight, or Hale and Dorr hired Ernst &amp; Young for the purpose of facilitating a legal communication with Hale and Dorr.\" <i>Cavallaro,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 57. It said that the Cavallaros must show that \"Ernst &amp; Young was an agent of Hale and Dorr, Knight or the Cavallaros.\" <i>Id.</i> at 58. We know that such a showing is not sufficient to sustain the privilege: as the district court recognized, an attorney, merely by placing an accountant on her payroll, does not, by this action alone, render communications between the attorney's client and the accountant privileged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Id.</i> at 57; <i>Kovel,</i> 296 F.2d at 921. We need not reach the question of whether such a showing is necessary. That is, we need not determine whether, in all instances, the attorney or client (as opposed to some third party) must hire the accountant in order to sustain a privilege under <i>Kovel.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the record does not show that any party hired Ernst &amp; Young to assist Hale and Dorr in providing legal advice, and we note that the agency relationship between the parties is relevant to, but not dispositive of, this question. <i>Kovel</i> requires that to sustain a privilege an accountant must be \"necessary, or at least highly useful, for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.\" <i>Kovel,</i> 296 F.2d at 922. This requirement resolves the <i>Kovel</i> dispute because the evidence shows that Ernst &amp; Young was not employed for this purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Hale and Dorr, as opposed to the Cavallaros or their sons, hired Ernst &amp; Young is, as the district court recognized, probative when considering whether Ernst &amp; Young was employed to help Hale and Dorr render legal advice. Typically, \"[a]gents of an attorney are ... retained by or at the discretion of the attorney and under the attorney's supervision.\" Rice, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 3:5, at 30. Here, the bulk of the evidence supports the claim that, at the December 1994 meeting, and going forward, Ernst &amp; Young acted as an agent for the sons or Camelot, but not for Hale and Dorr, the Cavallaros, or Knight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No one disputes that Camelot initially hired Ernst &amp; Young. Only one month prior to the December 1994 meeting, Ernst &amp; Young sent Camelot a letter of engagement stating that \"[a]ll advice and other services we provide pursuant to this engagement are solely for the benefit of Camelot ... and are not for the benefit of anyone other than the corporation and its shareholders.\" Camelot's CFO, David Frac, signed the letter and returned it to Ernst &amp; Young. Everyone also agrees that Camelot hired Ernst &amp; Young to provide financial advice, not to assist any lawyers. Prior to the December 1994 meeting, Ernst &amp; Young was not in any way coordinating its accounting advice with Hale and Dorr's legal advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cavallaros say that things changed at the December 1994 meeting. At that meeting, they say, it was \"clear to all parties\" that \"Ernst &amp; Young began assisting Hale and Dorr with respect to providing advice on transfer tax issues.\" They claim that Ernst &amp; Young continued in this role, as an assistant to Hale and Dorr on transfer tax and, later, merger issues, through 1995. More specifically, the Cavallaros argue that Ernst &amp; Young assisted Hale and Dorr in providing legal advice, and improved that advice, by, \"[a]mong other things, ... review[ing] the factual basis of Hale and Dorr's analysis to help determine whether it was consistent with the accounting records that Ernst &amp; Young had reviewed.\" The district court properly rejected the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that \"[t]he Cavallaros have not produced any contemporaneous documentation to suggest that, as of December 19, 1994, Ernst &amp; Young's professional relationship with the Cavallaro parents changed in a way that would trigger a privilege.\" <i>Cavallaro,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 59. The Cavallaros urge that the district court overlooked some evidence. First, that the bill for Ernst &amp; Young's services rendered through December 31, 1994, refers to services rendered to both Camelot <i>and</i> Knight. Second, that Ernst &amp; Young mailed this bill to Mrs. Cavallaro at Knight. Third, that Lawrence Goodman testified that, in 1994, Ernst &amp; Young was involved in providing tax advice to Camelot, Knight, and the Cavallaros. The district court did not mention this evidence, but it does not change the outcome here. None of it is \"contemporaneous documentation\" of the relationship between the parties at the meeting. The bill was presumably drafted after services were rendered. The parties never formally commemorated this purportedly changed relationship. Mr. Goodman's statement was made after the fact, in the midst of litigation, with little support in the contemporaneous record. The district court did not clearly err when it found as it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But all of this is slightly off-topic. The agency question aside, the evidence is strong that Ernst &amp; Young acted to provide accounting advice rather than to assist Hale and Dorr in providing legal advice. <i>Cf. United States v. Judson,</i> 322 F.2d 460, 462-63 (9th Cir.1963) (<i>Kovel</i> exception covers documents created by an accountant at an attorney's request for the purpose of advising and defending the client). Prior to the December 1994 meeting, Ernst &amp; Young provided accounting advice to Camelot independent of Hale and Dorr. After that meeting, the evidence supports the conclusion that Ernst &amp; Young and Hale and Dorr continued to work on their respective, separate tracks, albeit in a more coordinated way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are skeptical of the Cavallaros' claim that Ernst &amp; Young was present to assist attorney Hamel of Hale and Dorr, who was a senior partner of over twenty years' experience, and a specialist in trusts and estates, including, necessarily, consequent tax advice. Recognizing that an attorney's experience alone is not prima facie evidence that an accountant was not \"necessary, or at least highly useful,\" <i>Kovel,</i> 296 F.2d at 922, to the lawyer in providing legal assistance, we note that when a party hires an accountant to provide accounting advice, and only later hires an attorney to provide legal advice, it is particularly important for the party to show that the accountant later acted as an agent necessary to the lawyer in providing legal advice. <i>See</i> Rice, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 3:5, at 33-34 (noting that \"when the client has previously employed the agent independent of the attorney-client relationship, to perform the same services that he will perform for the attorney[,] .... [t]his creates a risk that the agent's retention by the attorney is simply a subterfuge\"); <i>id.</i> at 35 n. 66 (citing <i>Swarthmore Radiation Oncology, Inc. v. Lapes,</i> No. 92-3055, 1994 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 1970, at *9-12 (E.D.Pa. Feb. 18, 1994)). The Cavallaros have failed to make a sufficient showing here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the Cavallaros' assertion that a mere finding that an accountant was \"useful\" is all that is required under <i>Kovel,</i> \"[t]he available case law indicates that the `necessity' element means more than just useful and convenient. The involvement of the third party must be nearly indispensable or serve some specialized purpose in facilitating the attorney-client communications. Mere convenience is not sufficient.\" Epstein, <i>supra,</i> at 187. The Cavallaros' claim that Ernst &amp; Young \"had the capacity to benefit the quality of the legal advice that Hale and Dorr would render\" and that, \"[a]mong other things,\" Ernst &amp; Young double-checked Hale and Dorr's legal advice to make sure \"it was consistent with the accounting records that Ernst &amp; Young had reviewed\" is not enough to show that Ernst &amp; Young was necessary, or at least highly useful, in facilitating Hale and Dorr's provision of legal advice. That ends the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Common Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common-interest doctrine is typically understood to apply \"[w]hen two or more clients consult or retain an attorney on particular matters of common interest.\" <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra,</i> &#167; 503.21[1]; Wigmore, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2312, at 603-09. In such a situation, \"the communications between each of them and the attorney are privileged against third parties.\" <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra,</i> &#167; 503.21[1]; <i>see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena,</i> 274 F.3d at 573; <i>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp.,</i> 202 F.3d at 461. Similarly, the \"privilege applies to communications made by the client or the client's `lawyer to a lawyer representing another in a matter of common interest.'\" <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra,</i> &#167; 503.21[2] (quoting Sup.Ct. Standard 503(b)(3)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether one refers to either or both of these instances as \"common interest,\" \"joint defense,\" \"joint client,\" or \"allied lawyer\" doctrines does not change the outcome of this case. The common-interest doctrine, like the rule announced in <i>Kovel,</i> is \"not an independent basis for privilege, but an exception to the general rule that the attorney-client privilege is waived when privileged information is disclosed to a third party.\" Epstein, <i>supra,</i> at 196.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our resolution of the Cavallaros' <i>Kovel</i> argument resolves their common-interest claim as well. Although the district court directed its inquiry toward the alignment of interests between all of the parties in the case and then decided that, \"[e]ven if there were a sufficient commonality of interest,.... [u]nder the strict confines of the common-interest doctrine, the lack of representation for [the sons and Camelot] vitiates any claim to a privilege,\" 153 F.Supp.2d at 60, we do not need to reach these issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ernst &amp; Young was not covered by the attorney-client relationship between Hale and Dorr and its clients. Even if the Cavallaros, their sons, and their respective companies all had an exact unanimity of interest, it would not render communications created by or shared with Ernst &amp; Young privileged when Ernst &amp; Young was providing accounting services, not facilitating communication of legal advice between Hale and Dorr and its clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common-interest doctrine prevents clients from waiving the attorney-client privilege when attorney-client communications are shared with a third person who has a common legal interest with respect to these communications, for instance, a codefendant. The doctrine does not extend to prevent waiver when an accountant, not within the <i>Kovel</i> doctrine, is made privy to the attorney-client communications. In such an instance, the accountant does not share an interest in receiving legal advice from the lawyer and cannot logically be said to have an interest in common with the represented party or parties. Under <i>Kovel,</i> we know that when a client, a lawyer, and an accountant are present, the accountant's presence will destroy the privilege if the accountant is not \"necessary, or at least highly useful, for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer.\" 296 F.2d at 922. It follows that the client &#8212; in this case the Cavallaros &#8212; cannot resurrect the privilege by adding another party (their sons) and that party's accountant to the mix. This is true even if the sons share a common interest with the parents. To hold otherwise would be to create a loophole in <i>Kovel</i> whereby the privilege is undermined when a client and his attorney disclose information to an accountant who is not \"necessary, or at least highly useful, for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer,\" 296 F.2d at 922, but the privilege is preserved when the client brings another party with a common interest on board and that other party's accountant is present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cavallaros' argument that every party to the communication need not have his own lawyer in order for the common-interest doctrine to apply, although relevant to the district court's reasoning, is in the end beside the point, whether or not the argument is valid. Our conclusion that the documents are not privileged under <i>Kovel</i> resolves the common-interest claim because the common-interest rule presumes a valid underlying privilege. There is no valid underlying privilege here because, by having discussions with, and disclosing the documents to, Ernst &amp; Young, an accounting firm not necessary to permit Hale and Dorr to communicate legal advice to its client, the Cavallaros either waived the attorney-client privilege or undermined the privilege's confidentiality requirement. One cannot create a privilege, where previously there was none, simply by introducing a third party (with or without a common interest) into the circle within which documents are shared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the district court's judgment, denying the Cavallaros' motion to quash the summons and allowing the United States's motion to enforce the summons, is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The IRS issued its summons under the authority granted by 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7602 (1994 &amp; Supp. V 1999).

William and Patricia Cavallaro (\"Cavallaros\") owned Knight Tool Co., Inc., founded in 1976. Their adult sons owned Camelot Systems, Inc., created in 1987. The Cavallaros and their sons merged their respective corporations in 1995 and, on July 1, 1996, the merged entity sold for approximately $97 million. Subsequently, the Internal Revenue Service began an investigation into the Cavallaros' correct estate and gift tax (\"transfer tax\") liabilities. The IRS suspected that the parties might have undervalued the Cavallaros' Knight company and overvalued the sons' Camelot company to disguise a gift to the sons in the form of post-merger stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of this investigation, the IRS served a summons on Ernst &amp; Young, an accounting firm that Camelot had retained in June of 1994. The summons requested that Ernst &amp; Young produce \"all records\" in its possession regarding any work it did between 1984 and 1995 for the Cavallaros, their sons, and their respective corporations. The Cavallaros moved to quash the summons as overly broad and calling for privileged materials. They argued that the documents in Ernst &amp; Young's possession were protected by the attorney-client privilege because the documents were created by, or provided to, Ernst &amp; Young in the course of the efforts of the law firm Hale and Dorr to provide legal advice; particularly, advice sought in 1994 and 1995 concerning transfer tax and merger issues arising from the close relationship between Camelot and Knight. The IRS counterclaimed for enforcement of the summons. On July 27, 2001, the district court denied the Cavallaros' petition to quash and allowed the government's motion to enforce the summons. <i>Cavallaro v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433522\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433522/cavallaro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2001). Subsequently, the district court granted the Cavallaros' motion for stay pending appeal, thereby permitting the Cavallaros to continue to refrain from disclosing the documents that they allege are privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As in the district court proceedings, three categories of documents requested by the IRS are at issue: (1) documents pertaining to the December 19, 1994, meeting &#8212; between the Cavallaros, their sons, a Camelot accountant, accountants from Ernst &amp; Young, and at least one lawyer from Hale and Dorr &#8212; addressing transfer tax issues; (2) subsequent transfer tax communications arising from the December 19 meeting; and (3) documents related to communications addressing the 1995 merger of Knight and Camelot. All of the requested documents are in Ernst &amp; Young's possession. They are all documents either created by Ernst &amp; Young or transmitted to Ernst &amp; Young, not documents preserved solely in Hale and Dorr's files.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, as in the district court, the Cavallaros argue that these documents are privileged under <i>United States v. Kovel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"255675\"><a href=\"/opinion/255675/united-states-v-louis-kovel/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span> (2d Cir.1961), despite having been either created by or disclosed to Ernst &amp; Young, because Ernst &amp; Young aided Hale and Dorr in providing legal advice. They also argue that the documents fall within the common-interest exception to the rule that disclosure to a third party waives the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that this circuit would adopt the <i>Kovel</i> rule, we conclude that the documents are not privileged. We follow somewhat different reasoning than the district court. We need not decide whether, in all instances, the attorney or client (as opposed to some third party) must hire the accountant in order to sustain a privilege under <i>Kovel. Kovel</i> requires that to sustain a privilege an accountant must be \"necessary, or at least highly useful, for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer which the privilege is designed to permit.\" 296 F.2d at 922. Here, no party hired Ernst &amp; Young for this purpose. Therefore, the attorney-client privilege did not extend to the documents in question under the <i>Kovel</i> doctrine. Having found that the documents were not covered by the attorney-client privilege, we also conclude that they cannot fall within the common-interest exception, which presumes a valid underlying privilege in the first place. Consequently, we do not reach the district court's conclusion that \"[u]nder the strict confines of the common-interest doctrine, the lack of representation for [the sons and Camelot] vitiates any claim to a privilege,\" <i>Cavallaro,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 61, because Ernst &amp; Young was providing accounting services and so the <i>Kovel</i> extension of the privilege is inapplicable to the summoned documents, all of which were created by or disclosed to Ernst &amp; Young.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are undisputed except where otherwise noted. In 1976, the Cavallaros formed Knight Tool Co., Inc., to manufacture tools to be used by companies such as McDonnell Douglas, Polaroid, and Raytheon to assemble their products. Seven years later, in 1983, William Cavallaro and one of his three sons, Kenneth, developed a rudimentary glue-dispensing machine, which, for several years, was commercially unsuccessful due, at least in part, to difficulty in marketing the machine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, the Cavallaros formed a new company, Camelot Systems, Inc., to give the Cavallaros' three sons an opportunity to pursue the glue-dispensing machine business. In addition to paying its own employees, Knight paid the salaries of Camelot's employees. The three sons were named as Camelot's sole shareholders and, although Knight continued to make the glue-dispensing machines, Camelot became the machines' only distributor. Knight was Camelot's biggest supplier. In fact, Camelot's only business was selling glue-dispensing machines and accessories manufactured by Knight. The sons, working at Camelot, completely redesigned the Knight glue-dispensing machine and developed several new models of the machine. As a result, Camelot became a lucrative business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1992, the Cavallaros contacted attorney Louis Hamel Jr. Hamel was a long-time senior partner at the Hale and Dorr law firm, specializing in trusts and estates, exempt organizations, and pensions. He, along with other Hale and Dorr attorneys, periodically counseled the Cavallaros regarding Knight corporate matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cavallaros again contacted Hamel, in October 1994, this time for help with estate and retirement planning. Hamel considered, among other things, potential transfer tax issues arising in the context of the close business and family relationships between Knight and Camelot. Between December 19, 1994, and December 31, 1995, Hale and Dorr provided legal advice to Knight and the Cavallaros, acting on Knight's behalf, with respect to the merger of Knight into Camelot. Hale and Dorr advised the Cavallaros on, among other things, the drafting of affidavits purporting to establish the pre-merger values of Knight and Camelot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the Cavallaros were receiving legal advice from Hale and Dorr, their sons, as agents of Camelot, had begun receiving tax planning advice from Ernst &amp; Young. Camelot began meeting with Ernst &amp; Young in June of 1994. On November 16, 1994, Ernst &amp; Young documented its relationship with Camelot in a letter of engagement, stating that Ernst &amp; Young would be providing a \"Review of Corporate Structure and Recommendations,\" a \"Tax Checkup,\" and \"Transfer Planning.\" The letter, addressed to David Frac, Camelot's Chief Financial Officer, further stated that \"[a]ll advice and other services we provide pursuant to this engagement are solely for the benefit of Camelot ... and not for the benefit of anyone other than the corporation and its shareholders.\" Frac signed the letter and returned it to Ernst &amp; Young.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A draft of the invoice, however, for Ernst &amp; Young's services rendered through December 31, 1994, which explicitly included tax services rendered pursuant to the November 14 engagement letter, refers to services rendered to both Camelot <i>and</i> Knight. It was addressed and mailed to Mrs. Cavallaro at Knight. In addition, Lawrence Goodman, of Ernst &amp; Young, testified in his October 27, 2000, deposition that, in 1994, he was involved in providing tax advice to Camelot, Knight, and the Cavallaros. He also testified that around November or December of 1995, an Ernst &amp; Young employee began providing services to both Camelot and Knight. The district court, nonetheless, concluded that \"the undisputed evidence is that Ernst &amp; Young was paid by, and worked solely for, Camelot and its shareholders.\" <i>Cavallaro,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 58.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 15, 1994, Ernst &amp; Young sent a letter to William Cavallaro recommending the merger of Knight and Camelot and suggesting a strategy for minimizing transfer tax liability. Ernst &amp; Young understood that the Cavallaros and their sons would consider selling their respective companies, and proceeded to explain how the parties might structure the corporate relationship in order to facilitate a transfer of some of the proceeds from such a sale from the Cavallaros to their children while minimizing tax liability. Ernst &amp; Young stated that the letter would \"serve as the discussion document\" for an upcoming meeting between Ernst &amp; Young, Hale and Dorr, the Cavallaros, their sons, Kevin McGillivary (an accountant working for Camelot), and David Frac of Camelot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The letter explained that the IRS would scrutinize the pre-merger values of Knight and Camelot to determine the proper allocation of the post-merger sale proceeds between the Cavallaros and their sons. The pre-merger values were important because they would be the benchmark for determining whether the Cavallaros had disguised a gift to their sons in the form of post-merger stock and, if so, the size of that gift and the resulting transfer tax liability. Ernst &amp; Young stated that the pre-merger profit disparity between Knight and Camelot did not reflect the true values of the companies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current structure and resulting profit split does not seem to reflect the economic reality of the business arrangement. If one were to combine the entities, as currently structured, approximately 70% of the profit is earned by the Company that bears no risk with respect to product development, has no employees, does not bear any costs of sales, does not service or provide any warranty coverage on the product or own any of the technology. In a normal distributor relationship .... this arrangement does not exist.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS, Ernst &amp; Young said, would likely attribute most of the value of the post-merger corporation to the Cavallaros, which would defeat the tax saving goal of allocating most of the profits of the pre-merger corporations to their sons. The letter stated that \"[b]ased on the facts that exist today, it would be hard to justify Camelot taking more than a small amount of the allocated proceeds\" from a sale of the businesses. More specifically, Ernst &amp; Young suggested that, upon merger, as much as 85% of the shares of the merged entity would go to the Cavallaros, with only 15% of the shares going to their sons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It appears that the Cavallaros desired a post-merger distribution more favorable to their sons, but that a post-merger redistribution would create significant transfer tax liability. Ernst &amp; Young proposed a solution. Ernst &amp; Young recommended a \"two step approach\" to \"eliminate[] the exposure related to reallocation of income.\" Step one was to merge Knight and Camelot. Step two \"involve[d] the gifting of stock in the merged entity by [the Cavallaros] to [their sons] in the amounts that would result in the desired ownership split.\" Ernst &amp; Young recommended that the gifting be done using a Grantor Retained Annuity Trust. This gifting was necessary, according to Ernst &amp; Young, because of the real pre-merger distribution of assets, which heavily favored Knight and the Cavallaros and disfavored Camelot and the sons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to December 19, 1994, the parties agree that Ernst &amp; Young and Hale and Dorr were not working together or in a coordinated fashion, even if each firm knew that the other was somehow involved in advising the Cavallaros, their sons, or the companies. On December 19, the Cavallaros, their sons, a Camelot accountant, accountants from Ernst &amp; Young, and at least one lawyer from Hale and Dorr met as planned. This meeting is important to the case because the Cavallaros assert that, at this meeting, \"Ernst &amp; Young began assisting Hale and Dorr with respect to providing advice on transfer tax issues.\" The Cavallaros say that Ernst &amp; Young continued in this role, as an assistant to Hale and Dorr, through 1995. At the meeting, neither Camelot nor the sons were represented by an attorney; Hale and Dorr represented only the Cavallaros.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear what happened next. As the IRS has stated, this is, at least in part, what they are attempting to investigate by way of the challenged subpoena. What we do know is that the Cavallaros did not follow Ernst &amp; Young's December 15, 1994, recommendations. Instead, on May 23, 1995, Mr. Cavallaro and one of his sons signed affidavits that were at odds with Ernst &amp; Young's conclusion that \"it would be very hard to justify Camelot taking more than a small amount of the allocated proceeds\" from a sale of the businesses. Hale and Dorr, not Ernst &amp; Young, prepared these affidavits. In these two separate, but nearly identical affidavits, Mr. Cavallaro and his son stated that Knight had transferred, for no compensation, its glue-dispensing machine technology to Camelot when Camelot was formed in 1987. They stated that, at the time of the transfer, the technology \"had no ascertainable value,\" \"had no reasonable prospect of realizing a profit,\" and was \"no more than a promising but raw idea.\" They stated that Camelot \"entirely redesigned the original dispensing product.\" Knight and Camelot then supplemented these affidavits with a confirmatory bill of sale, also dated May 23, 1995, purporting to confirm the previously undocumented gift from Knight to Camelot. The Cavallaros say that Hale and Dorr had prepared drafts of all of these documents before the December 19, 1994, meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This claimed, undocumented transfer was important to the pre-merger valuation of the companies and hence to the correct post-merger distribution of shares. On December 31, 1995, Knight merged into Camelot. As part of the merger, the Cavallaros received 19% of Camelot's stock. This allocation was based on Ernst &amp; Young's December 31, 1995, valuation of the companies, which reflected the alleged, but undocumented, technology transfer. Ernst &amp; Young's December 1995 valuation, attributing most of the value of the post-merger corporation to Camelot, was at odds with its 1994 suggestion that Camelot shares would form only a small part of the post-merger corporation's value. On July 1, 1996, the merged corporation was sold for approximately $97 million. The 1995 merger, based on the 1995 valuation, resulted in a distribution of assets to the Cavallaros' sons that substantially reduced the Cavallaros' transfer tax liabilities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suspicious of these circumstances, the IRS began a tax fraud investigation into the Cavallaros' correct federal tax liabilities for the years 1987 through 1996. The investigation focused on whether the Cavallaros had manufactured a prior gift to their children, through the use of the alleged technology transfer, to avoid transfer taxes. The IRS sought to determine whether Knight was undervalued and whether Camelot was overvalued at the time of the merger because, if this were the case, then the Cavallaros would have disguised a gift to their sons in the form of post-merger stock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of this investigation, the IRS, on December 7, 1999, issued a third-party recordkeeping summons to Ernst &amp; Young.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The summons began by requesting \"[a]ll records relating to [Ernst &amp; Young's] engagements with William, Patricia, Paul, Kenneth, or James Cavallaro[], Knight Tool ... or Camelot Systems ... at any time from 1984 through 1995.\" The IRS issued the summons because, in response to a prior summons it had issued in the investigation, it had obtained a copy of the December 15, 1994, Ernst &amp; Young letter, which it believed \"to be materially inconsistent with subsequent sworn statements made [by] William Cavallaro and a subsequent valuation rendered by Ernst &amp; Young.\" The IRS stated that the 1994 valuation \"sets forth a pre-merger analysis which is materially inconsistent with a subsequent valuation rendered by Ernst &amp; Young .... [and] materially at odds with sworn statements submitted by William Cavallaro.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cavallaros moved to quash the summons as overly broad and calling for privileged materials. They argued that the summoned documents are privileged because Ernst &amp; Young helped Hale and Dorr provide legal advice beginning on December 19, 1994. They also argued that the documents fall within the common-interest rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the Cavallaros provided the IRS with a substantial number of documents, including excerpts from the diaries of Ernst &amp; Young employees who worked for Knight or Camelot and what the Cavallaros say are nearly all of Knight's and Camelot's accounting records. This dispute is over those remaining documents that the Cavallaros have refused to produce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IRS counterclaimed for enforcement of the summons. On September 19, 2000, the district court heard arguments and authorized the IRS to depose Lawrence Goodman, a senior manager in Ernst &amp; Young's tax department, primarily to determine whether any additional documents existed relating to Ernst &amp; Young's work for the Cavallaros, their sons, and the two companies. Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(b)(6). After the deposition, Hale and Dorr provided the IRS with an amended privilege log and a letter stating the reasons why it believed each of the documents in the log to be privileged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 27, 2001, the district court denied the Cavallaros' petition to quash and allowed the government's motion to enforce the summons. <i>Cavallaro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2433522\"><a href=\"/opinion/2433522/cavallaro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The parties to this litigation recognize as much, but agree, correctly, that accountant-client communications are privileged if they meet the traditional requirements of the attorney-client privilege. With this foundation laid, we turn to the Cavallaros' privilege claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cavallaros argue that the attorney-client privilege protects the three categories of subpoenaed documents, all of which are in Ernst &amp; Young's possession. For a communication to be covered by the attorney-client privilege, the communication must be made in confidence. Wigmore, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2292, at 554. Another requirement is that the privilege not be waived. <i>Id.</i> The presence of third parties during an attorney-client communication is often sufficient to undermine the \"made in confidence\" requirement, 3 <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence</i> &#167; 503.15[3] (J.M. McLaughlin, ed., 2d ed.2002), or to waive the privilege, E.S. Epstein, <i>The Attorney-Client Privilege and the Work-Product Doctrine</i> 168-69, 189 (4th ed.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, the Cavallaros invoke two doctrines to support their claim that disclosing the subpoenaed documents to Ernst &amp; Young neither undermined the confidentiality requirement nor waived the privilege. First, they say that the documents were all created or received by Ernst &amp; Young after it began to assist Hale and Dorr in rendering legal advice and so the documents fall under the <i>Kovel</i> doctrine, which they characterize as holding that the presence of some third parties that are \"necessary, or at least highly useful,\" to facilitating attorney-client communication does not destroy the privilege. 296 F.2d at 922. Second, they say that the documents fall within what they call the \"common-interest privilege.\" The Cavallaros bear the burden of establishing that the attorney-client privilege is a defense to the enforcement of the IRS's summons, but, if the privilege is established, the government bears the burden of showing that the privilege is defeated by an exception. <i>Fed.

It said that the Cavallaros must show that \"Ernst &amp; Young was an agent of Hale and Dorr, Knight or the Cavallaros.\" <i>Id.</i> at 58. We know that such a showing is not sufficient to sustain the privilege: as the district court recognized, an attorney, merely by placing an accountant on her payroll, does not, by this action alone, render communications between the attorney's client and the accountant privileged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>Id.</i> at 57; <i>Kovel,</i> 296 F.2d at 921. We need not reach the question of whether such a showing is necessary.

This requirement resolves the <i>Kovel</i> dispute because the evidence shows that Ernst &amp; Young was not employed for this purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether Hale and Dorr, as opposed to the Cavallaros or their sons, hired Ernst &amp; Young is, as the district court recognized, probative when considering whether Ernst &amp; Young was employed to help Hale and Dorr render legal advice. Typically, \"[a]gents of an attorney are ... retained by or at the discretion of the attorney and under the attorney's supervision.\" Rice, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 3:5, at 30. Here, the bulk of the evidence supports the claim that, at the December 1994 meeting, and going forward, Ernst &amp; Young acted as an agent for the sons or Camelot, but not for Hale and Dorr, the Cavallaros, or Knight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No one disputes that Camelot initially hired Ernst &amp; Young. Only one month prior to the December 1994 meeting, Ernst &amp; Young sent Camelot a letter of engagement stating that \"[a]ll advice and other services we provide pursuant to this engagement are solely for the benefit of Camelot ... and are not for the benefit of anyone other than the corporation and its shareholders.\" Camelot's CFO, David Frac, signed the letter and returned it to Ernst &amp; Young. Everyone also agrees that Camelot hired Ernst &amp; Young to provide financial advice, not to assist any lawyers. Prior to the December 1994 meeting, Ernst &amp; Young was not in any way coordinating its accounting advice with Hale and Dorr's legal advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cavallaros say that things changed at the December 1994 meeting. At that meeting, they say, it was \"clear to all parties\" that \"Ernst &amp; Young began assisting Hale and Dorr with respect to providing advice on transfer tax issues.\" They claim that Ernst &amp; Young continued in this role, as an assistant to Hale and Dorr on transfer tax and, later, merger issues, through 1995. More specifically, the Cavallaros argue that Ernst &amp; Young assisted Hale and Dorr in providing legal advice, and improved that advice, by, \"[a]mong other things, ... review[ing] the factual basis of Hale and Dorr's analysis to help determine whether it was consistent with the accounting records that Ernst &amp; Young had reviewed.\" The district court properly rejected the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that \"[t]he Cavallaros have not produced any contemporaneous documentation to suggest that, as of December 19, 1994, Ernst &amp; Young's professional relationship with the Cavallaro parents changed in a way that would trigger a privilege.\" <i>Cavallaro,</i> 153 F.Supp.2d at 59. The Cavallaros urge that the district court overlooked some evidence. First, that the bill for Ernst &amp; Young's services rendered through December 31, 1994, refers to services rendered to both Camelot <i>and</i> Knight. Second, that Ernst &amp; Young mailed this bill to Mrs. Cavallaro at Knight. Third, that Lawrence Goodman testified that, in 1994, Ernst &amp; Young was involved in providing tax advice to Camelot, Knight, and the Cavallaros. The district court did not mention this evidence, but it does not change the outcome here. None of it is \"contemporaneous documentation\" of the relationship between the parties at the meeting. The bill was presumably drafted after services were rendered. The parties never formally commemorated this purportedly changed relationship. Mr. Goodman's statement was made after the fact, in the midst of litigation, with little support in the contemporaneous record. The district court did not clearly err when it found as it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But all of this is slightly off-topic. The agency question aside, the evidence is strong that Ernst &amp; Young acted to provide accounting advice rather than to assist Hale and Dorr in providing legal advice. <i>Cf. United States v. Judson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"261769\"><a href=\"/opinion/261769/united-states-v-harold-judson/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span>, 462-63 (9th Cir.1963) (<i>Kovel</i> exception covers documents created by an accountant at an attorney's request for the purpose of advising and defending the client). Prior to the December 1994 meeting, Ernst &amp; Young provided accounting advice to Camelot independent of Hale and Dorr. After that meeting, the evidence supports the conclusion that Ernst &amp; Young and Hale and Dorr continued to work on their respective, separate tracks, albeit in a more coordinated way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are skeptical of the Cavallaros' claim that Ernst &amp; Young was present to assist attorney Hamel of Hale and Dorr, who was a senior partner of over twenty years' experience, and a specialist in trusts and estates, including, necessarily, consequent tax advice. Recognizing that an attorney's experience alone is not prima facie evidence that an accountant was not \"necessary, or at least highly useful,\" <i>Kovel,</i> 296 F.2d at 922, to the lawyer in providing legal assistance, we note that when a party hires an accountant to provide accounting advice, and only later hires an attorney to provide legal advice, it is particularly important for the party to show that the accountant later acted as an agent necessary to the lawyer in providing legal advice. <i>See</i> Rice, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 3:5, at 33-34 (noting that \"when the client has previously employed the agent independent of the attorney-client relationship, to perform the same services that he will perform for the attorney[,] ....

The involvement of the third party must be nearly indispensable or serve some specialized purpose in facilitating the attorney-client communications. Mere convenience is not sufficient.\" Epstein, <i>supra,</i> at 187. The Cavallaros' claim that Ernst &amp; Young \"had the capacity to benefit the quality of the legal advice that Hale and Dorr would render\" and that, \"[a]mong other things,\" Ernst &amp; Young double-checked Hale and Dorr's legal advice to make sure \"it was consistent with the accounting records that Ernst &amp; Young had reviewed\" is not enough to show that Ernst &amp; Young was necessary, or at least highly useful, in facilitating Hale and Dorr's provision of legal advice. That ends the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Common Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common-interest doctrine is typically understood to apply \"[w]hen two or more clients consult or retain an attorney on particular matters of common interest.\" <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra,</i> &#167; 503.21[1]; Wigmore, <i>supra,</i> &#167; 2312, at 603-09. In such a situation, \"the communications between each of them and the attorney are privileged against third parties.\" <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra,</i> &#167; 503.21[1]; <i>see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena,</i> 274 F.3d at 573; <i>Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp.,</i> 202 F.3d at 461. Similarly, the \"privilege applies to communications made by the client or the client's `lawyer to a lawyer representing another in a matter of common interest.'\" <i>Weinstein's Federal Evidence, supra,</i> &#167; 503.21[2] (quoting Sup.Ct. Standard 503(b)(3)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether one refers to either or both of these instances as \"common interest,\" \"joint defense,\" \"joint client,\" or \"allied lawyer\" doctrines does not change the outcome of this case. The common-interest doctrine, like the rule announced in <i>Kovel,</i> is \"not an independent basis for privilege, but an exception to the general rule that the attorney-client privilege is waived when privileged information is disclosed to a third party.\" Epstein, <i>supra,</i> at 196.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our resolution of the Cavallaros' <i>Kovel</i> argument resolves their common-interest claim as well. Although the district court directed its inquiry toward the alignment of interests between all of the parties in the case and then decided that, \"[e]ven if there were a sufficient commonality of interest,.... [u]nder the strict confines of the common-interest doctrine, the lack of representation for [the sons and Camelot] vitiates any claim to a privilege,\" 153 F.Supp.2d at 60, we do not need to reach these issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ernst &amp; Young was not covered by the attorney-client relationship between Hale and Dorr and its clients. Even if the Cavallaros, their sons, and their respective companies all had an exact unanimity of interest, it would not render communications created by or shared with Ernst &amp; Young privileged when Ernst &amp; Young was providing accounting services, not facilitating communication of legal advice between Hale and Dorr and its clients.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The common-interest doctrine prevents clients from waiving the attorney-client privilege when attorney-client communications are shared with a third person who has a common legal interest with respect to these communications, for instance, a codefendant. The doctrine does not extend to prevent waiver when an accountant, not within the <i>Kovel</i> doctrine, is made privy to the attorney-client communications. In such an instance, the accountant does not share an interest in receiving legal advice from the lawyer and cannot logically be said to have an interest in common with the represented party or parties. Under <i>Kovel,</i> we know that when a client, a lawyer, and an accountant are present, the accountant's presence will destroy the privilege if the accountant is not \"necessary, or at least highly useful, for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer.\" 296 F.2d at 922. It follows that the client &#8212; in this case the Cavallaros &#8212; cannot resurrect the privilege by adding another party (their sons) and that party's accountant to the mix. This is true even if the sons share a common interest with the parents. To hold otherwise would be to create a loophole in <i>Kovel</i> whereby the privilege is undermined when a client and his attorney disclose information to an accountant who is not \"necessary, or at least highly useful, for the effective consultation between the client and the lawyer,\" 296 F.2d at 922, but the privilege is preserved when the client brings another party with a common interest on board and that other party's accountant is present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cavallaros' argument that every party to the communication need not have his own lawyer in order for the common-interest doctrine to apply, although relevant to the district court's reasoning, is in the end beside the point, whether or not the argument is valid. Our conclusion that the documents are not privileged under <i>Kovel</i> resolves the common-interest claim because the common-interest rule presumes a valid underlying privilege. There is no valid underlying privilege here because, by having discussions with, and disclosing the documents to, Ernst &amp; Young, an accounting firm not necessary to permit Hale and Dorr to communicate legal advice to its client, the Cavallaros either waived the attorney-client privilege or undermined the privilege's confidentiality requirement. One cannot create a privilege, where previously there was none, simply by introducing a third party (with or without a common interest) into the circle within which documents are shared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, the district court's judgment, denying the Cavallaros' motion to quash the summons and allowing the United States's motion to enforce the summons, is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The IRS issued its summons under the authority granted by 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7602 (1994 &amp; Supp. V 1999).
