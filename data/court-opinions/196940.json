Plaintiffs later brought  this\r\n\nwrongful death diversity action against the Hong Kong corporation\r\n\nthat  owns  the hotel  --  a  corporation that  has  no  place of\r\n\nbusiness outside of  Hong Kong.

The  district court denied both motions,  and we now\r                    \r\n\naffirm.\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n          Tak How is a Hong  Kong corporation with its only place\r\n\nof business in  Hong Kong.   Its  sole asset is  the Holiday  Inn\r\n\nCrowne Plaza Harbour View in Hong Kong (\"Holiday Inn\"), where the\r\n\naccident  in  this  case took  place.   Tak  How  has  no assets,\r\n\nshareholders, or  employees in  Massachusetts.   Sally Ann  Nowak\r\n\n(\"Mrs. Nowak\")  was at  all relevant  times married  to plaintiff\r\n\nRalph  Nowak  (\"Mr. Nowak\")  and  was  the  mother of  their  two\r\n\nchildren  (collectively, the plaintiffs  are \"the Nowaks\").   The\r\n\nNowaks  lived in  Marblehead, Massachusetts,  and  Mr. Nowak  was\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Section II.A. was authored by  Judge Coffin.  This opinion was\r\ncirculated  to the  active  judges of  the  First Circuit  before\r\nissuance.    This  informal  circulation,   however,  is  without\r\nprejudice to  a petition for  rehearing or suggestion of  en banc\r\nreconsideration on any issue in the  case.  NLRB v. Hospital  San\r                                                                           \r\nRafael, Inc., 42 F.3d 45, 51 n.1 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                      \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nemployed  by  Kiddie  Products,  Inc., which  has  its  place  of\r\n\nbusiness  in Avon, Massachusetts.  Kiddie Products does extensive\r\n\nbusiness in Hong  Kong.  As  a Preliminary Design Manager  in the\r\n\nMarketing  Department,  Mr. Nowak  customarily made  two business\r\n\ntrips to Hong Kong each year,  accompanied by his wife on one  of\r\n\nthose trips.\r\n\n          Kiddie Products employees  had made trips to  Hong Kong\r\n\nsince at least 1982, but  the company's relationship with Tak How\r\n\nand the Holiday Inn began only in 1992.  John Colantuone, a vice-\r\n\npresident, was one  such employee who had travelled  to Hong Kong\r\n\nsince 1982  and had stayed  at various other hotels.   Colantuone\r\n\nwas acquainted  with the  Holiday Inn  through advertisements  on\r\n\nHong Kong  radio in 1983 or 1984, but  only decided to stay there\r\n\nin  1992 after  becoming  dissatisfied with  the  rates at  other\r\n\nhotels.   On  his first  visit, Colantuone  met with  the Holiday\r\n\nInn's  sales manager to negotiate a corporate discount for Kiddie\r\n\nProducts employees.  Holiday Inn agreed to the discount and wrote\r\n\na letter confirming the arrangement  based on a minimum number of\r\n\nroom nights per  year.  Marie Burke,  Colantuone's administrative\r\n\nassistant,  made   all  hotel  reservations   for  the  company's\r\n\nemployees.   Although Kiddie Products regularly compared rates at\r\n\nother  hotels, Burke  was told  to book  all reservations  at the\r\n\nHoliday  Inn  until  instructed otherwise.    Since  1992, Kiddie\r\n\nProducts employees have stayed exclusively at the Holiday Inn.\r\n\n          In June 1993,  the Holiday Inn telecopied  Colantuone a\r\n\nmessage announcing  new  corporate rates  and  other  promotional\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nmaterials.  Burke requested additional information, and the hotel\r\n\npromptly responded.  In July 1993, after a series of exchanges by\r\n\ntelecopier,  Burke sent a reservation  request to the Holiday Inn\r\n\nfor several employees for September and October 1993.  One of the\r\n\nreservations was  for Mr. and  Mrs. Nowak to arrive  on September\r\n\n16.  On September 18, while the Nowaks were registered guests  at\r\n\nthe hotel, Mrs. Nowak  drowned in the hotel  swimming pool.   The\r\n\nspecific facts surrounding  her death are not relevant  here.  It\r\n\nis  uncontested that  in 1992  and  1993, prior  to Mrs.  Nowak's\r\n\ndeath, Tak How advertised the Holiday Inn in certain national and\r\n\ninternational   publications,  some   of   which  circulated   in\r\n\nMassachusetts.    In addition,  in  February 1993,  Tak  How sent\r\n\ndirect mail solicitations to approximately 15,000 of its previous\r\n\nguests, including previous guests residing in Massachusetts.\r\n\n          The  Nowaks  filed  this   wrongful  death  action   in\r\n\nMassachusetts state court in June 1994.  Tak How then removed the\r\n\ncase to federal district court and filed two motions to dismiss -\r\n\n- one for  lack of  personal jurisdiction under  Fed. R. Civ.  P.\r\n\n12(b)(2) and  the other for  forum non conveniens.   The district\r                                                           \r\n\ncourt initially  denied  the  motion  to dismiss  for  forum  non\r                                                                           \r\n\nconveniens,  and  then, after  allowing  time for  jurisdictional\r                    \r\n\ndiscovery,  issued  a  memorandum  and  order  denying  the  Rule\r\n\n12(b)(2) motion.  Nowak v. Tak How Inv. Ltd., 899 F. Supp. 25 (D.\r                                                      \r\n\nMass. 1995).   The  district court granted  Tak How's  motion for\r\n\ncertification  of the jurisdictional issue, but this Court denied\r\n\nTak How's  request for  a stay of  the district  court proceeding\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\npending appeal.  Nonetheless, believing that a resulting judgment\r\n\nwould not be enforceable in Hong Kong, Tak How did not answer the\r\n\nNowaks' complaint.   Accordingly,  the district  court entered  a\r\n\ndefault judgment  against  Tak How  for $3,128,168.33.   Tak  How\r\n\nappeals the denial of its Rule 12(b)(2)  motion and its motion to\r\n\ndismiss the case for forum non conveniens.\r                                                   \r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          We  first  review the  denial  of Tak  How's  motion to\r\n\ndismiss for  lack of personal  jurisdiction.  The  district court\r\n\nemployed  a  prima  facie standard  in  making  its determination\r\n\nrather than adjudicating  the jurisdictional facts.   See Foster-\r                                                                           \r\n\nMiller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox  Can., 46 F.3d 138, 145-147 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1995).   Both the court's  decision to use  the prima  facie\r\n\nstandard and its conclusion  under that standard are  reviewed de\r                                                                           \r\n\nnovo.  Id.  at 147.  To  begin, we find no error  in the district\r                    \r\n\ncourt's  choice  of  the  prima facie  standard.    A  full-blown\r\n\nevidentiary hearing was  not necessary in  this case because  the\r\n\nfacts  were, in  all  essential respects,  undisputed.   In  such\r\n\ncircumstances, the prima  facie standard is both  appropriate and\r\n\npreferred.   Id. at 145; Boit  v. Gar-Tec Prods., Inc.,  967 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n671, 675-676 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n          The next question is whether the district court reached\r\n\nthe proper result.  In diversity cases such as this, the district\r\n\ncourt's  personal  jurisdiction over  a nonresident  defendant is\r\n\ngoverned  by the  forum state's  long-arm statute.   Sawtelle  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nFarrell,  70  F.3d  1381,  1387  (1st  Cir.  1995).    Under  the\r                 \r\n\nMassachusetts statute,\r\n\n            [a]   court    may   exercise    personal\r\n            jurisdiction  over  a  person,  who  acts\r\n            directly or by an agent, as to a cause of\r\n            action in  law or equity arising from the\r\n            person's .  . . transacting  any business\r\n            in this Commonwealth.\r\n\nMass. Gen.  Laws Ann.  ch.  223A,    3(a)  (1985).   The  statute\r\n\nimposes constraints on personal jurisdiction that go beyond those\r\n\nimposed by the Constitution.  Gray v. O'Brien, 777 F.2d  864, 866\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1985).   We must  therefore  find sufficient  contacts\r\n\nbetween the  defendant and  the forum state  to satisfy  both the\r\n\nMassachusetts long-arm statute and  the Constitution.   Sawtelle,\r                                                                          \r\n\n70 F.3d at 1387.\r\n\n          To satisfy  the requirements  of the  long-arm statute,\r\n\nSection  3(a), the  defendant must  have  transacted business  in\r\n\nMassachusetts and the plaintiffs' claim must have arisen from the\r\n\ntransaction of business  by the defendant.  Tatro  v. Manor Care,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc.,  625   N.E.2d  549,  551   (Mass.  1994).    In   Tatro,  a\r                                                                       \r\n\nMassachusetts  plaintiff  sued  a California  hotel  for injuries\r\n\nsustained in California.   The Court  concluded that the  hotel's\r\n\nsolicitation of  business from Massachusetts  residents satisfied\r\n\nthe \"transacting any  business\" requirement of Section  3(a), id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nat 551-552, and that the \"arising from\" requirement was satisfied\r\n\nwhere,  but for  the  hotel's  solicitations  and  acceptance  of\r\n\nreservations,  the plaintiff  would  not  have  been  injured  in\r\n\nCalifornia.   Id. at 554.   The factual  scenario in the  present\r                           \r\n\ncase  is analogous in  all essential  respects, and  we therefore\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nhave little  difficulty concluding that sufficient contacts exist\r\n\nto satisfy Section 3(a)'s requirements.\r\n\n          Turning to  the constitutional  restraints, this  Court\r\n\nfollows  a tripartite analysis  for determining the  existence of\r\n\nspecific personal jurisdiction (plaintiffs do not  allege general\r\n\npersonal jurisdiction):\r\n\n            First,   the    claim   underlying    the\r\n            litigation must directly arise out of, or\r\n            relate  to,  the  defendant's forum-state\r\n            activities.    Second,   the  defendant's\r\n            forum-state  contacts  must  represent  a\r\n            purposeful availment of  the privilege of\r\n            conducting activities in the forum state,\r\n            thereby   invoking   the   benefits   and\r\n            protections  of  that  state's  laws  and\r\n            making   the    defendant's   involuntary\r\n            presence   before   the   state's   court\r\n            foreseeable.    Third,  the  exercise  of\r\n            jurisdiction  must,   in  light   of  the\r\n            Gestalt factors, be reasonable.\r\n\nPritzker  v. Yari,  42 F.3d  53, 60-61  (1st Cir.  1994) (quoting\r                           \r\n\nUnited Elec.

Ct. 1959.\r                                             \r\n\n                         A.  Relatedness\r\n\n          What this  Court calls  the \"relatedness\"  test is  one\r\n\naspect   of   demonstrating    minimum   contacts   pursuant   to\r\n\nInternational Shoe  Co. v. Washington,  326 U.S. 310.   The other\r                                               \r\n\naspect, discussed  below, focuses  on the  deliberateness of  the\r\n\ndefendant's  contacts,  or  purposeful  availment.    Tak   How's\r\n\nprincipal  argument  on  appeal is  that  relatedness  requires a\r\n\nproximate   cause   relationship   between   its  contacts   with\r\n\nMassachusetts and the Nowaks' cause of action. \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          In  arguing for a proximate cause relatedness test, Tak\r\n\nHow  relies on  a series  of First  Circuit cases  beginning with\r\n\nMarino v. Hyatt Corp., 793 F.2d 427 (1st Cir. 1986).  See Crocker\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Hilton  Int'l Barbados,  Ltd., 976 F.2d  797 (1st  Cir. 1992);\r                                          \r\n\nFournier  v. Best  Western Treasure  Island Resort, 962  F.2d 126\r                                                            \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992);  Pizarro v.

In  each of these cases,  this Court\r\n\nconstrued the language of a  state long-arm statute requiring, as\r\n\ndoes the Massachusetts  statute quoted above,  that the cause  of\r\n\naction \"arise\" from  the forum-state contacts.   Construing those\r\n\nstatutes,  we rejected plaintiffs'  arguments that the  injury at\r\n\nissue would not have occurred \"but for\" the forum-state contacts.\r\n\nInstead, we held  that the defendant's conduct must  be the legal\r\n\nor proximate cause of the injury.

The  Court decided  that  the  \"but for\"  test  is more\r               \r\n\nconsistent   with  the  language  of  the  long-arm  statute  and\r\n\nexplicitly  rejected our  interpretation of  the  statute in  the\r\n\nMarino line of cases.  625  N.E.2d at 553.  Personal jurisdiction\r                \r\n\nwas  proper in Tatro  because the California  hotel had solicited\r                              \r\n\nbusiness in Massachusetts and had agreed to provide the plaintiff\r\n\nwith accommodations; but for those acts,  the plaintiff would not\r\n\nhave been injured.

Its position is\r                \r\n\nnot  without support.   In  Pleasant Street,  we stated  that the\r                                                     \r\n\nMassachusetts  statute's relatedness  requirement \"mirrors  a key\r\n\nconstitutional   requirement  for   the   exercise  of   specific\r\n\njurisdiction.\"     960  F.2d  at  1087.     Then,  in  explaining\r\n\nconstitutional   relatedness,  we   set  forth   proximate  cause\r\n\nprinciples derived  from the Marino  line of cases.   See  id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n1089.\r\n\n          The Nowaks, on the other  hand, argue that these  cases\r\n\nhave no  constitutional significance.   They find support  from a\r\n\nfootnote in Ticketmaster-New York,  Inc. v. Alioto, 26  F.3d 201,\r                                                            \r\n\n207 n.8 (1st Cir. 1994):\r\n\n            In our view, [the Marino line of cases] -\r                                              \r\n            - which interpret the term \"arising from\"\r\n            as  that  term is  used  in  the long-arm\r\n            statutes  of Massachusetts  -- deal  with\r\n            state-law   issues  and   have  no   real\r\n            implication    for    the     relatedness\r\n            requirement    specifically     or    for\r\n            constitutional analysis generally. \r\n\n(citations omitted).\r\n\n          Despite the apparent conflict, these cases are arguably\r\n\nreconcilable.   After all,  Ticketmaster did not  directly reject\r                                                  \r\n\nPleasant Street  or the proximate  cause test, but  merely stated\r                         \r\n\nthe  evident fact  that  the  Marino line  of  cases centered  on\r                                              \r\n\ninterpretations of  state law.   It might follow, then,  that our\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ndiscussion  in Pleasant  Street should  govern  our course  here.\r                                         \r\n\nPleasant  Street, however, as well as Ticketmaster, described the\r                                                            \r\n\nrelatedness concept in  only the most general way.   Neither case\r\n\nspecifically defined the  precise inquiry  under the  relatedness\r\n\ntest  in this  circuit.   Fortunately, however, these  cases, and\r\n\nothers, articulated certain principles that guide our inquiry.  \r\n\n          As  an  initial matter,  \"[w]e  know  .  . .  that  the\r\n\n[relatedness]  requirement  focuses  on  the  nexus  between  the\r\n\ndefendant's  contacts  and  the  plaintiff's  cause  of  action.\"\r\n\nTicketmaster,  26  F.3d  at  206.   The  requirement  serves  two\r                      \r\n\npurposes.\r\n\n            First,  relatedness is  the divining  rod\r\n            that   separates  specific   jurisdiction\r\n            cases  from  general  jurisdiction cases.\r\n            Second, it  ensures that  the element  of\r\n            causation remains in the forefront of the\r\n            due process investigation.\r\n\nId.   Most courts  share this emphasis  on causation,  but differ\r             \r\n\nover  the proper  causative threshold.    Generally, courts  have\r\n\ngravitated toward one of two  familiar tort concepts -- \"but for\"\r\n\nor \"proximate cause.\"\r\n\n          The Ninth Circuit is the most  forceful defender of the\r\n\n\"but for\" test.   In Shute v.  Carnival Cruise Lines,2  the court\r                                                              \r\n\nstated that \"but for\" serves the basic function of relatedness by\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2    Shute was  reversed  by  the  Supreme Court  on  alternative\r                    \r\ngrounds.   499 U.S. 585.   As reflected by subsequent  cases, the\r\nNinth Circuit still adheres to  the \"but for\" test.  See  Ballard\r                                                                           \r\nv.

A\r\n\nmore  stringent standard, the court asserted, \"would represent an\r\n\nunwarranted  departure from the  core concepts of  'fair play and\r\n\nsubstantial justice,'\" because it would preclude  jurisdiction in\r\n\ncases where it would  be reasonable.   Id. at 386.

Nonetheless, cases  from other\r\n\ncircuits suggest a  similar approach.   In Prejean v.  Sonatrach,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., the Fifth Circuit noted: \r              \r\n\n            Logically,  there is no reason why a tort\r\n            cannot grow out of a contractual contact.\r\n            In  a  case  like   this,  a  contractual\r\n            contact is  a \"but for\"  causative factor\r\n            for the tort since it brought the parties\r\n            within  tortious  \"striking  distance\" of\r\n            one  another.    While  the  relationship\r\n            between  a tort  suit  and a  contractual\r\n            contact  is certainly  more tenuous  than\r\n            when  a tort  suit  arises  from  a  tort\r\n            contact,  that only  goes to  whether the\r\n            contact is by  itself sufficient for  due\r\n            process, not whether the suit arises from\r\n            the contact.\r\n\n652  F.2d 1260,  1270 n.21  (5th Cir.  1981).

Certainly, jurisdiction that is\r\n\npremised  on  a contact  that  is a  legal  cause  of the  injury\r\n\nunderlying  the controversy -- i.e., that \"form[s] an 'important,\r                                             \r\n\nor [at  least] material,  element of  proof'  in the  plaintiff's\r\n\ncase,\" Pleasant Street, 960 F.2d at 1089 (citation omitted) -- is\r                                \r\n\npresumably reasonable, assuming, of course, purposeful availment.\r\n\n          As  our discussion  suggests,  and notwithstanding  any\r\n\ncontrary  implication from the footnote in Ticketmaster, we think\r                                                                 \r\n\nthe proximate cause standard better comports with the relatedness\r\n\ninquiry  because it  so easily  correlates  to foreseeability,  a\r\n\nsignificant component of the jurisdictional inquiry.  A \"but for\"\r\n\nrequirement,  on  the  other  hand,  has  in itself  no  limiting\r\n\nprinciple; it literally  embraces every event that  hindsight can\r\n\nlogically identify  in the causative  chain.  True, as  the Ninth\r\n\nCircuit has  noted, courts  can use the  reasonableness prong  to\r\n\nkeep Pandora's jar  from opening too wide.   But to say  that the\r\n\nharm that might be done by one factor can be prevented by another\r\n\nis not, after all, an affirmative justification for the former.\r\n\n          That being said, we are persuaded that strict adherence\r\n\nto  a   proximate  cause   standard  in   all  circumstances   is\r\n\nunnecessarily restrictive.   The  concept of  proximate cause  is\r\n\ncritically important in the  tort context because it defines  the\r\n\nscope of a  defendant's liability.  In contrast,  the first prong\r\n\nof the jurisdictional  tripartite test is  not as rigid:   it is,\r\n\n\"relatively  speaking, .  . .  a  'flexible, relaxed  standard.'\"\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nSawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1389  (citation omitted).  We see  no reason\r                  \r\n\nwhy, in  the context of  a relationship between a  contractual or\r\n\nbusiness  association and  a  subsequent  tort,  the  absence  of\r\n\nproximate cause  per  se should  always  render the  exercise  of\r\n\nspecific jurisdiction unconstitutional.  \r\n\n          When a foreign  corporation directly targets  residents\r\n\nin  an ongoing  effort to  further  a business  relationship, and\r\n\nachieves its purpose,  it may not necessarily  be unreasonable to\r\n\nsubject that corporation  to forum jurisdiction when  the efforts\r\n\nlead  to  a  tortious  result.   The  corporation's  own  conduct\r\n\nincreases  the likelihood that  a specific resident  will respond\r\n\nfavorably.  If the resident is harmed while engaged in activities\r\n\nintegral to the relationship the corporation sought to establish,\r\n\nwe think  the nexus between the contacts  and the cause of action\r\n\nis  sufficiently  strong to  survive the  due process  inquiry at\r\n\nleast at the relatedness stage.\r\n\n          This concept represents a small overlay of \"but for\" on\r\n\n\"proximate cause.\"  In a sense it is a narrower and more specific\r\n\nidentification   of  the   Seventh   Circuit's  formulation   for\r\n\njurisdiction-worthiness  of   claims  lying  \"in   the  wake\"  of\r\n\ncommercial activities in  the forum.  It may be  that other kinds\r\n\nof  fact patterns  will  be found  to  meet the  basic factor  of\r\n\nforeseeability, but  we have no  occasion here to  pronounce more\r\n\nbroadly.\r\n\n          This  case is illustrative  of our reasoning.   Through\r\n\nits ongoing  correspondence with  Kiddie Products,  Tak How  knew\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nthat Kiddie Products employees would stay at its hotel, and could\r\n\neasily anticipate  that  they  might  use the  pool,  a  featured\r\n\namenity of the  hotel.  The  district court thoroughly  described\r\n\nt   h   i   s           c   o   n   n   e   c   t   i   o   n   .\r\n            The  Hotel's  solicitation   of  Kiddie's\r\n            business and the extensive back-and-forth\r\n            resulting in  Burke's reserving a  set of\r\n            rooms  for  Kiddie  employees  and  their\r\n            spouses  set   in  motion   a  chain   of\r\n            reasonably  foreseeable events  resulting\r\n            in Mrs. Nowak's  death.  The  possibility\r\n            that   the   solicitation   would   prove\r\n            successful  and that one  or more  of the\r\n            guests staying  at the Hotel as  a result\r\n            would use the pool was in no sense remote\r\n            or  unpredictable;  in  fact,  the  Hotel\r\n            included the pool as an attraction in its\r\n            promotional materials.\r\n\n899  F.  Supp.  at  31.    While  the  nexus  between  Tak  How's\r\n\nsolicitation  of Kiddie Products' business and Mrs. Nowak's death\r\n\ndoes  not  constitute  a proximate  cause  relationship,  it does\r\n\nrepresent a meaningful  link between  Tak How's  contact and  the\r\n\nharm suffered.   Given these circumstances, we think  it would be\r\n\nimprudent  to reject  jurisdiction  at this  early  stage of  the\r\n\ninquiry.\r\n\n          By this approach, we intend to emphasize the importance\r\n\nof proximate causation,  but to allow a slight  loosening of that\r\n\nstandard when circumstances  dictate.  We think  such flexibility\r\n\nis necessary in  the jurisdictional inquiry:   relatedness cannot\r\n\nmerely be  reduced to  one tort  concept  for all  circumstances.\r\n\nThough we are  recognizing a  narrow exception  to the  proximate\r\n\ncause  test, we  note an  additional  protection for  defendants'\r\n\nrights:  \"the relatedness requirement  . . . authorizes the court\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nto  take  into   account  the  strength  (or   weakness)  of  the\r\n\nplaintiff's relatedness  showing in passing upon  the fundamental\r\n\nfairness of allowing the suit to proceed.\"  Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat 207.\r\n\n          We recognize it  will not always be easy  to apply this\r\n\nflexible  approach to  particular circumstances,  but  that is  a\r\n\nfunction of  the  complexity  of  this  area of  the  law.    The\r\n\njurisdictional  inquiry   is  often  a  difficult  fact  specific\r\n\nanalysis in which  \"[t]he greys are dominant and  even among them\r\n\nthe shades are  innumerable.\"  Pleasant Street, 960  F.2d at 1088\r                                                        \r\n\n(citing Estin v.

Purposeful Availment\r\n\n          The  next  issue  is whether  Tak  How's  contacts with\r\n\nMassachusetts constitute  purposeful availment.   The  purposeful\r\n\navailment requirement ensures  that jurisdiction is not  premised\r\n\non  \"random, isolated,  or fortuitous\"  contacts  with the  forum\r\n\nstate,  Sawtelle,  70 F.3d  at  1391 (quoting  Keeton  v.

The June 1993\r\n\ncorrespondence contained promotional  materials from the  Holiday\r\n\nInn  designed to further entice Kiddie Products employees to stay\r\n\nat the  hotel.  Even  if it may be  said that the  materials were\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nsent  as  part  of  an  on-going  relationship  between  the  two\r\n\ncompanies  that was originally instigated by Kiddie Products, the\r\n\ncontinued correspondence  by Tak  How to  Massachusetts does  not\r\n\namount to  the kind  of unilateral action  that makes  the forum-\r\n\nstate  contacts involuntary.   Tak  How had an  obvious financial\r\n\ninterest in  continuing business  with Kiddie  Products, and  the\r\n\nJune 1993  correspondence is  the best example  of an  unprompted\r\n\nsolicitation designed  to facilitate that  business relationship.\r\n\nIn   order  to  be  subject  to  Massachusetts'  jurisdiction,  a\r\n\ndefendant need  only have  one contact with  the forum  state, so\r\n\nlong as that contact is  meaningful.  McGee v. International Live\r                                                                           \r\n\nIns.

That  Tak  How  might  have  to  defend  itself  in   a\r\n\nMassachusetts  court is certainly foreseeable based on its direct\r\n\ncorrespondence  with Kiddie Products, but its other contacts with\r\n\nMassachusetts reveal an even more substantial attempt by  Tak How\r\n\nto  purposefully  avail  itself of  the  privilege  of conducting\r\n\nbusiness activities in  the state:  Tak How  advertised its hotel\r\n\nin  national and  international publications  that circulated  in\r\n\nMassachusetts; it solicited by  direct mail some of  its previous\r\n\nguests residing in Massachusetts; and Tak How listed its hotel in\r\n\nvarious  hotel guides used  at travel agencies  in Massachusetts.\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nExercising  jurisdiction  is   appropriate  where  the  defendant\r\n\npurposefully  derives  economic  benefits  from  its  forum-state\r\n\nactivities.

These  \"gestalt factors\"  are  as\r                \r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n            (1) the defendant's  burden of appearing,\r\n            (2)   the  forum   state's  interest   in\r\n            adjudicating   the   dispute,   (3)   the\r\n            plaintiff's    interest   in    obtaining\r\n            convenient and effective  relief, (4) the\r\n            judicial system's  interest in  obtaining\r\n            the  most  effective  resolution  of  the\r\n            controversy, and (5) the common interests\r\n            of    all    sovereigns    in   promoting\r\n            substantive social policies.\r\n\nId.

In  such  cases,   the  gestalt  factors  may  tip  the\r\n\nconstitutional  balance.   Ticketmaster,  26  F.3d at  209.

In  Asahi,  the\r                                                                     \r\n\nquestion of minimum contacts divided  the Court, but eight of the\r\n\nJustices agreed  that exercising personal jurisdiction  would not\r\n\ncomport with notions of fair  play and substantial justice.  This\r\n\nCourt has thus  adopted a sliding scale approach:   \"[T]he weaker\r\n\nthe plaintiff's showing on the first  two prongs (relatedness and\r\n\npurposeful availment), the less a defendant need show in terms of\r\n\nunreasonableness to  defeat jurisdiction.\"  Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat  210.

The Burden of  Appearance.  It would undoubtedly be\r\n\nburdensome for  Tak How to  defend itself in Massachusetts:   Tak\r\n\nHow's only  place of business  is in Hong  Kong.  This  Court has\r\n\nrecognized,  however, that it  is almost always  inconvenient and\r\n\ncostly  for  a  party  to litigate  in  a  foreign  jurisdiction.\r\n\nPritzker, 42 F.3d at 64.  Thus for this particular gestalt factor\r                  \r\n\nto have  any significance,  the defendant  must demonstrate  that\r\n\n\"exercise of jurisdiction in the present circumstances is onerous\r\n\nin  a special,  unusual,  or  other constitutionally  significant\r\n\nway.\"  Id.  Tak How alleges  nothing special or unusual about its\r                    \r\n\nsituation beyond the ordinary cost and inconvenience of defending\r\n\nan action  so far  from its place  of business.   Under Pritzker,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nthat is not enough:  it simply cannot be the case that every Hong\r\n\nKong corporation is  immune from suit in Massachusetts.

We are also  persuaded\r\n\nthat the burden on Tak How will be minimized by, for example, the\r\n\navailability of transcripts  from the Coroner's Court for  use in\r\n\nthe Massachusetts proceeding.\r\n\n          We have also noted that  the burden of appearance is an\r\n\nimportant gestalt factor  primarily because it allows  a court to\r\n\nguard against harassing litigation.

Interest of  the Forum.  Although a forum state has\r\n\na significant interest in obtaining jurisdiction over a defendant\r\n\nwho causes tortious  injury within its borders,  Ticketmaster, 26\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  at  211, that  interest  is  diminished  where  the  injury\r\n\noccurred outside  the forum  state.  Sawtelle,  70 F.3d  at 1395.\r                                                       \r\n\nNonetheless, our task is not  to compare the interest of  the two\r\n\nsovereigns -- the place  of the injury and forum state  -- but to\r\n\ndetermine whether the forum state has an interest.  Id.  While it\r                                                                 \r\n\nis true that the injury in this case occurred in Hong Kong, it is\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nequally true (unlike Sawtelle) that significant events took place\r                                       \r\n\nin Massachusetts giving  it an interest in this  litigation.  Tak\r\n\nHow  solicited business  in the  state.   As  the district  court\r\n\nnoted,  Massachusetts has  a strong  interest  in protecting  its\r\n\ncitizens  from out-of-state solicitations  for goods  or services\r\n\nthat prove to be unsafe, and it also has an interest in providing\r\n\nits citizens  with a  convenient forum in  which to  assert their\r\n\nclaims.   Burger King,  471 U.S. at  473.   Given the forum-state\r                               \r\n\nactivities  that took  place  prior  to  Mrs. Nowak's  death,  we\r\n\nconclude that Massachusetts  has a strong interest  in exercising\r\n\njurisdiction even though the injury took place in Hong Kong.\r\n\n          3.    The  Plaintiffs' Convenience.    This  Court must\r\n\naccord deference  to the Nowaks' choice of a Massachusetts forum.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Foster-Miller,  46 F.3d  at 151.   Regardless,  it is\r                                   \r\n\nobvious that  a Massachusetts  forum is more  convenient for  the\r\n\nNowaks  than another  forum,  particularly  a  Hong  Kong  forum.\r\n\nFurther, there  exists substantial  doubt that  the Nowaks  could\r\n\nadequately resolve  the dispute in  Hong Kong:  Hong  Kong's laws\r\n\nregarding contingency fees and posting of security bonds with the\r\n\ncourt  make litigation  economically onerous for  plaintiffs, and\r\n\nthe future of Hong Kong's political system is also uncertain.\r\n\n          4.  The Administration of Justice.  This factor focuses\r\n\non the judicial system's interest in obtaining the most effective\r\n\nresolution of  the controversy.   Usually this factor is  a wash,\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nTicketmaster, 26 F.3d at 211;  Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1395,  but in\r                                                 \r\n\none case we held that preventing piecemeal litigation might favor\r\n\none jurisdiction over another.  Pritzker, 42 F.3d at 64.  Tak How\r                                                  \r\n\nargues  that a Massachusetts action would require the application\r\n\nof Hong Kong law, the use of interpreters, and the transportation\r\n\nof  key  witnesses  from  Hong  Kong  that  are  not  subject  to\r\n\ncompulsory  process.   On the  other  hand, the  Nowaks point  to\r\n\npossible political instability in Hong Kong as the British Colony\r\n\nprepares  to revert  to Chinese  sovereignty.   Interpreters  and\r\n\ntransportation of  witnesses would  likely also  be necessary  in\r\n\nHong   Kong.    We  conclude  that   the  question  of  efficient\r\n\nadministration  of justice favors  a Massachusetts forum.   Given\r\n\nthe likelihood that the Nowaks would face great obstacles in Hong\r\n\nKong due to possible political  instability, as well as Hong Kong\r\n\nlaws  on contingency fees and security bonds, efficiency concerns\r\n\nrequire a Massachusetts  forum.  See United Elec.  Workers v. 163\r                                                                           \r\n\nPleasant St. Corp.,  987 F.2d 39, 46-47 (1st  Cir. 1993) (finding\r                            \r\n\nthat fourth gestalt factor weighed against a foreign jurisdiction\r\n\nwhere \"it  is  far from  clear that  there will  be any  judicial\r\n\nresolution,  let alone the most effective judicial resolution, of\r\n\nthis   controversy\"  if   the   case   could   not   proceed   in\r\n\nMassachusetts).\r\n\n          5.   Pertinent  Policy Arguments.    The final  gestalt\r\n\nfactor addresses  the interests  of the  affected governments  in\r\n\nsubstantive  social policies.   Massachusetts has an  interest in\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nprotecting  its citizens from out-of-state providers of goods and\r\n\nservices as well as affording  its citizens a convenient forum in\r\n\nwhich to bring their claims.  These interests are best  served by\r\n\nthe exercise  of  jurisdiction in  Massachusetts.   On the  other\r\n\nhand, Hong Kong has an interest in protecting visitors to promote\r\n\nand  preserve its tourism industry, in protecting its businesses,\r\n\nand  in providing all parties with a  convenient forum.  Only one\r\n\nof Hong Kong's interests -- protecting its businesses -- might be\r\n\ncompromised  by  a  Massachusetts   forum,  while  Massachusetts'\r\n\nprimary  interest  --   protecting  its  citizens  --   might  be\r\n\ncompromised by  a Hong Kong  forum.   We thus  conclude that  the\r\n\nfinal Gestalt factor tips only slightly in the Nowaks' favor.\r\n\n          On balance, we think the gestalt factors weigh strongly\r\n\nin  favor  of  a   Massachusetts  forum.    When  considered   in\r\n\ncombination with the  Nowaks' adequate showing  on the first  two\r\n\nprongs of the constitutional test, we think that, on the specific\r\n\nfacts of this case, the exercise of jurisdiction in Massachusetts\r\n\nis reasonable and does  not offend the notions  of fair play  and\r\n\nsubstantial  justice.    The  district  court therefore  properly\r\n\ndenied  Tak How's  Rule 12(b)(2)  motion to  dismiss for  lack of\r\n\npersonal jurisdiction.\r\n\n                               III.\r\n\n          Tak  How  next  appeals the  denial  of  its motion  to\r\n\ndismiss  for forum  non conveniens.   The  doctrine of  forum non\r                                                                           \r\n\nconveniens permits  a trial court,  on a discretionary  basis, to\r                    \r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\ndismiss  a case  where an  alternative  forum is  a available  in\r\n\nanother country  that is fair  to the  parties and  substantially\r\n\nmore convenient for them or the courts.  Howe v.  Goldcorp Invs.,\r                                                                           \r\n\nLtd., 946 F.2d 944, 947 (1st  Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502  U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n1095.   Application  of the  doctrine is  committed to  the sound\r\n\ndiscretion  of  the  trial  court,  whose decision  will  not  be\r\n\nreversed absent a clear abuse of discretion.  Mercier v. Sheraton\r                                                                           \r\n\nInt'l, Inc.,  981 F.2d 1345,  1349 (1st Cir. 1992)  (Mercier III)\r                                                                          \r\n\n(appeal  after remand  of Mercier II,  infra; we  have previously\r                                                      \r\n\nreferred to  the district  court's opinion  as Mercier  I), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 508  U.S. 912.

He\r\n            should not  be deprived  of the  presumed\r\n            advantages  of   his  home   jurisdiction\r\n            except  upon  a  clear  showing of  facts\r\n            which   either    (1)   establish    such\r\n            oppressiveness   and   vexation    to   a\r\n            defendant as to be  out of all proportion\r\n            to plaintiff's convenience,  which may be\r\n            shown to be slight or nonexistent, or (2)\r\n            make   trial   in    the   chosen   forum\r\n            inappropriate  because of  considerations\r\n            affecting the court's  own administrative\r\n            or legal problems.\r\n\nKoster v. Lumbermens Mut. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524.\r                                       \r\n\n          Based on  these principles, we  are unable to  say that\r\n\nthe district  court  abused  its discretion.    Tak  How's  first\r\n\nargument is  that  the district  court failed  to articulate  its\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nreasons for  denying the motion to dismiss.   It is true that the\r\n\ndistrict judge  chose to  rule on the  motion orally  rather than\r\n\nissue a written opinion; however, it is apparent from the hearing\r\n\ntranscript  that the judge  considered relevant factors.   Before\r\n\nruling on  the motion,  the judge  questioned  counsel about  the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  right to  have a  jury  trial in  Hong Kong,  and he\r\n\nstated  that granting the  motion would be  outcome determinative\r\n\nbecause,  as a  practical matter  and due  to additional  burdens\r\n\nunder Hong Kong laws,  it would be very difficult  for the Nowaks\r\n\nto bring suit there.  The  hearing transcript is certainly not as\r\n\ndetailed  as  the  written  opinion  denying  the  jurisdictional\r\n\nmotion, but the court was entitled to rule on the motion orally.\r\n\n          The  question here is whether the district court failed\r\n\nto consider  a material factor  or failed to correctly  weigh the\r\n\nfactors.   Given  that Tak  How  has the  burden  of proving  the\r\n\nelements of  forum non  conveniens, we shall  review the  factors\r                                            \r\n\nalleged to justify dismissal that  Tak How has put forth, bearing\r\n\nin mind that  Koster, supra, places a heavy  burden on defendants\r                                     \r\n\nwhere,  as here,  plaintiffs brought  suit in  their home  forum.\r\n\nThere is no question that Hong Kong is an available forum, as Tak\r\n\nHow is subject to  service of process in Hong Kong.   Mercier II,\r                                                                          \r\n\n935 F.2d at 424.   There also appears to be  no dispute that Hong\r\n\nKong would provide an adequate forum in the sense that its courts\r\n\nrecognize a similar cause of action.   Tak How next contends that\r\n\nthe private interest factors of Gilbert, supra, weigh in favor of\r                                                        \r\n\na Hong Kong  forum:  it notes  that it would bear  the expense of\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\ntransporting witnesses to  the United States, that  it might face\r\n\ndifficulty in  joining third-party defendants in  a Massachusetts\r\n\ncourt, and that a Hong Kong court might not enforce  the judgment\r\n\nof a  Massachusetts court.   These factors do not  constitute the\r\n\ntype   of  \"oppressiveness  and   vexation\"  required  by  Koster\r                                                                           \r\n\ndisproportionate  to the Nowaks'  inconvenience of suing  in Hong\r\n\nKong.  The Nowaks  would also have to transport witnesses to Hong\r\n\nKong and later seek to  enforce a foreign judgment in their  home\r\n\nstate.  In addition, the Nowaks point to private interest factors\r\n\nthat weigh in  their favor:  they would  face financial obstacles\r\n\nbecause Hong  Kong law  prohibits contingent  fee agreements  and\r\n\nrequires that  they deposit  an amount equal  to Tak  How's costs\r\n\nwith  the  court;  also, possible  political  instability  in the\r\n\nregion could add further difficulties to litigation in Hong Kong.\r\n\nRegardless  of  the difficulties  the Nowaks  might face  in Hong\r\n\nKong,  it is  enough that  Tak How  failed to  demonstrate either\r\n\noppressiveness to itself or only a slight or nonexistent interest\r\n\nin convenience on the Nowaks' part.  Koster, 330 U.S. at 524. \r                                                     \r\n\n          Nor  is Tak  How able  to  demonstrate public  interest\r\n\nfactors  that  make  trial in  Massachusetts  inappropriate.   It\r\n\npoints to the fact that Massachusetts choice-of-law rules require\r\n\napplication of Hong Kong law, and that a Hong Kong court would be\r\n\n\"more at home\" with such laws.  This concern is not sufficient to\r\n\novercome  the presumption in  favor of plaintiffs'  chosen forum.\r\n\nThis  Court  has previously  noted  that  \"the  task of  deciding\r\n\nforeign  law [is]  a chore  federal courts  must often  perform.\"\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nMercier III, 981 F.2d at  1357 (quoting Manu Int'l, S.A.  v.

Kiddie Products does extensive\r\n\nbusiness in Hong  Kong.  As  a Preliminary Design Manager  in the\r\n\nMarketing  Department,  Mr. Nowak  customarily made  two business\r\n\ntrips to Hong Kong each year,  accompanied by his wife on one  of\r\n\nthose trips.\r\n\n          Kiddie Products employees  had made trips to  Hong Kong\r\n\nsince at least 1982, but  the company's relationship with Tak How\r\n\nand the Holiday Inn began only in 1992.  John Colantuone, a vice-\r\n\npresident, was one  such employee who had travelled  to Hong Kong\r\n\nsince 1982  and had stayed  at various other hotels.   Colantuone\r\n\nwas acquainted  with the  Holiday Inn  through advertisements  on\r\n\nHong Kong  radio in 1983 or 1984, but  only decided to stay there\r\n\nin  1992 after  becoming  dissatisfied with  the  rates at  other\r\n\nhotels.   On  his first  visit, Colantuone  met with  the Holiday\r\n\nInn's  sales manager to negotiate a corporate discount for Kiddie\r\n\nProducts employees.  Holiday Inn agreed to the discount and wrote\r\n\na letter confirming the arrangement  based on a minimum number of\r\n\nroom nights per  year.  Marie Burke,  Colantuone's administrative\r\n\nassistant,  made   all  hotel  reservations   for  the  company's\r\n\nemployees.   Although Kiddie Products regularly compared rates at\r\n\nother  hotels, Burke  was told  to book  all reservations  at the\r\n\nHoliday  Inn  until  instructed otherwise.    Since  1992, Kiddie\r\n\nProducts employees have stayed exclusively at the Holiday Inn.\r\n\n          In June 1993,  the Holiday Inn telecopied  Colantuone a\r\n\nmessage announcing  new  corporate rates  and  other  promotional\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nmaterials.  Burke requested additional information, and the hotel\r\n\npromptly responded.  In July 1993, after a series of exchanges by\r\n\ntelecopier,  Burke sent a reservation  request to the Holiday Inn\r\n\nfor several employees for September and October 1993.  One of the\r\n\nreservations was  for Mr. and  Mrs. Nowak to arrive  on September\r\n\n16.  On September 18, while the Nowaks were registered guests  at\r\n\nthe hotel, Mrs. Nowak  drowned in the hotel  swimming pool.   The\r\n\nspecific facts surrounding  her death are not relevant  here.  It\r\n\nis  uncontested that  in 1992  and  1993, prior  to Mrs.  Nowak's\r\n\ndeath, Tak How advertised the Holiday Inn in certain national and\r\n\ninternational   publications,  some   of   which  circulated   in\r\n\nMassachusetts.    In addition,  in  February 1993,  Tak  How sent\r\n\ndirect mail solicitations to approximately 15,000 of its previous\r\n\nguests, including previous guests residing in Massachusetts.\r\n\n          The  Nowaks  filed  this   wrongful  death  action   in\r\n\nMassachusetts state court in June 1994.  Tak How then removed the\r\n\ncase to federal district court and filed two motions to dismiss -\r\n\n- one for  lack of  personal jurisdiction under  Fed. R. Civ.  P.\r\n\n12(b)(2) and  the other for  forum non conveniens.

The factual  scenario in the  present\r                           \r\n\ncase  is analogous in  all essential  respects, and  we therefore\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nhave little  difficulty concluding that sufficient contacts exist\r\n\nto satisfy Section 3(a)'s requirements.\r\n\n          Turning to  the constitutional  restraints, this  Court\r\n\nfollows  a tripartite analysis  for determining the  existence of\r\n\nspecific personal jurisdiction (plaintiffs do not  allege general\r\n\npersonal jurisdiction):\r\n\n            First,   the    claim   underlying    the\r\n            litigation must directly arise out of, or\r\n            relate  to,  the  defendant's forum-state\r\n            activities.    Second,   the  defendant's\r\n            forum-state  contacts  must  represent  a\r\n            purposeful availment of  the privilege of\r\n            conducting activities in the forum state,\r\n            thereby   invoking   the   benefits   and\r\n            protections  of  that  state's  laws  and\r\n            making   the    defendant's   involuntary\r\n            presence   before   the   state's   court\r\n            foreseeable.    Third,  the  exercise  of\r\n            jurisdiction  must,   in  light   of  the\r\n            Gestalt factors, be reasonable.\r\n\nPritzker  v.

In  each of these cases,  this Court\r\n\nconstrued the language of a  state long-arm statute requiring, as\r\n\ndoes the Massachusetts  statute quoted above,  that the cause  of\r\n\naction \"arise\" from  the forum-state contacts.   Construing those\r\n\nstatutes,  we rejected plaintiffs'  arguments that the  injury at\r\n\nissue would not have occurred \"but for\" the forum-state contacts.\r\n\nInstead, we held  that the defendant's conduct must  be the legal\r\n\nor proximate cause of the injury.

Personal jurisdiction\r                \r\n\nwas  proper in Tatro  because the California  hotel had solicited\r                              \r\n\nbusiness in Massachusetts and had agreed to provide the plaintiff\r\n\nwith accommodations; but for those acts,  the plaintiff would not\r\n\nhave been injured.

After all,  Ticketmaster did not  directly reject\r                                                  \r\n\nPleasant Street  or the proximate  cause test, but  merely stated\r                         \r\n\nthe  evident fact  that  the  Marino line  of  cases centered  on\r                                              \r\n\ninterpretations of  state law.   It might follow, then,  that our\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ndiscussion  in Pleasant  Street should  govern  our course  here.\r                                         \r\n\nPleasant  Street, however, as well as Ticketmaster, described the\r                                                            \r\n\nrelatedness concept in  only the most general way.   Neither case\r\n\nspecifically defined the  precise inquiry  under the  relatedness\r\n\ntest  in this  circuit.   Fortunately, however, these  cases, and\r\n\nothers, articulated certain principles that guide our inquiry.  \r\n\n          As  an  initial matter,  \"[w]e  know  .  . .  that  the\r\n\n[relatedness]  requirement  focuses  on  the  nexus  between  the\r\n\ndefendant's  contacts  and  the  plaintiff's  cause  of  action.\"\r\n\nTicketmaster,  26  F.3d  at  206.   The  requirement  serves  two\r                      \r\n\npurposes.\r\n\n            First,  relatedness is  the divining  rod\r\n            that   separates  specific   jurisdiction\r\n            cases  from  general  jurisdiction cases.\r\n            Second, it  ensures that  the element  of\r\n            causation remains in the forefront of the\r\n            due process investigation.\r\n\nId.   Most courts  share this emphasis  on causation,  but differ\r             \r\n\nover  the proper  causative threshold.    Generally, courts  have\r\n\ngravitated toward one of two  familiar tort concepts -- \"but for\"\r\n\nor \"proximate cause.\"\r\n\n          The Ninth Circuit is the most  forceful defender of the\r\n\n\"but for\" test.   In Shute v.  Carnival Cruise Lines,2  the court\r                                                              \r\n\nstated that \"but for\" serves the basic function of relatedness by\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2    Shute was  reversed  by  the  Supreme Court  on  alternative\r                    \r\ngrounds.   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112577\"><a href=\"/opinion/112577/carnival-cruise-lines-inc-v-shute/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

While  the  relationship\r\n            between  a tort  suit  and a  contractual\r\n            contact  is certainly  more tenuous  than\r\n            when  a tort  suit  arises  from  a  tort\r\n            contact,  that only  goes to  whether the\r\n            contact is by  itself sufficient for  due\r\n            process, not whether the suit arises from\r\n            the contact.\r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"392037\"><a href=\"/opinion/392037/mary-jean-prejean-v-sonatrach-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  1270 n.21  (5th Cir.  1981).

Adherence  to a proximate cause  standard is\r\n\nlikely  to enable defendants  better to anticipate  which conduct\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nmight subject them to a  state's jurisdiction than a more tenuous\r\n\nlink in the chain of  causation.  Certainly, jurisdiction that is\r\n\npremised  on  a contact  that  is a  legal  cause  of the  injury\r\n\nunderlying  the controversy -- i.e., that \"form[s] an 'important,\r                                             \r\n\nor [at  least] material,  element of  proof'  in the  plaintiff's\r\n\ncase,\" Pleasant Street, 960 F.2d at 1089 (citation omitted) -- is\r                                \r\n\npresumably reasonable, assuming, of course, purposeful availment.\r\n\n          As  our discussion  suggests,  and notwithstanding  any\r\n\ncontrary  implication from the footnote in Ticketmaster, we think\r                                                                 \r\n\nthe proximate cause standard better comports with the relatedness\r\n\ninquiry  because it  so easily  correlates  to foreseeability,  a\r\n\nsignificant component of the jurisdictional inquiry.  A \"but for\"\r\n\nrequirement,  on  the  other  hand,  has  in itself  no  limiting\r\n\nprinciple; it literally  embraces every event that  hindsight can\r\n\nlogically identify  in the causative  chain.  True, as  the Ninth\r\n\nCircuit has  noted, courts  can use the  reasonableness prong  to\r\n\nkeep Pandora's jar  from opening too wide.   But to say  that the\r\n\nharm that might be done by one factor can be prevented by another\r\n\nis not, after all, an affirmative justification for the former.\r\n\n          That being said, we are persuaded that strict adherence\r\n\nto  a   proximate  cause   standard  in   all  circumstances   is\r\n\nunnecessarily restrictive.   The  concept of  proximate cause  is\r\n\ncritically important in the  tort context because it defines  the\r\n\nscope of a  defendant's liability.  In contrast,  the first prong\r\n\nof the jurisdictional  tripartite test is  not as rigid:   it is,\r\n\n\"relatively  speaking, .  . .  a  'flexible, relaxed  standard.'\"\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nSawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1389  (citation omitted).  We see  no reason\r                  \r\n\nwhy, in  the context of  a relationship between a  contractual or\r\n\nbusiness  association and  a  subsequent  tort,  the  absence  of\r\n\nproximate cause  per  se should  always  render the  exercise  of\r\n\nspecific jurisdiction unconstitutional.  \r\n\n          When a foreign  corporation directly targets  residents\r\n\nin  an ongoing  effort to  further  a business  relationship, and\r\n\nachieves its purpose,  it may not necessarily  be unreasonable to\r\n\nsubject that corporation  to forum jurisdiction when  the efforts\r\n\nlead  to  a  tortious  result.   The  corporation's  own  conduct\r\n\nincreases  the likelihood that  a specific resident  will respond\r\n\nfavorably.  If the resident is harmed while engaged in activities\r\n\nintegral to the relationship the corporation sought to establish,\r\n\nwe think  the nexus between the contacts  and the cause of action\r\n\nis  sufficiently  strong to  survive the  due process  inquiry at\r\n\nleast at the relatedness stage.\r\n\n          This concept represents a small overlay of \"but for\" on\r\n\n\"proximate cause.\"  In a sense it is a narrower and more specific\r\n\nidentification   of  the   Seventh   Circuit's  formulation   for\r\n\njurisdiction-worthiness  of   claims  lying  \"in   the  wake\"  of\r\n\ncommercial activities in  the forum.  It may be  that other kinds\r\n\nof  fact patterns  will  be found  to  meet the  basic factor  of\r\n\nforeseeability, but  we have no  occasion here to  pronounce more\r\n\nbroadly.\r\n\n          This  case is illustrative  of our reasoning.   Through\r\n\nits ongoing  correspondence with  Kiddie Products,  Tak How  knew\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nthat Kiddie Products employees would stay at its hotel, and could\r\n\neasily anticipate  that  they  might  use the  pool,  a  featured\r\n\namenity of the  hotel.  The  district court thoroughly  described\r\n\nt   h   i   s           c   o   n   n   e   c   t   i   o   n   .\r\n            The  Hotel's  solicitation   of  Kiddie's\r\n            business and the extensive back-and-forth\r\n            resulting in  Burke's reserving a  set of\r\n            rooms  for  Kiddie  employees  and  their\r\n            spouses  set   in  motion   a  chain   of\r\n            reasonably  foreseeable events  resulting\r\n            in Mrs. Nowak's  death.  The  possibility\r\n            that   the   solicitation   would   prove\r\n            successful  and that one  or more  of the\r\n            guests staying  at the Hotel as  a result\r\n            would use the pool was in no sense remote\r\n            or  unpredictable;  in  fact,  the  Hotel\r\n            included the pool as an attraction in its\r\n            promotional materials.\r\n\n899  F.  Supp.  at  31.    While  the  nexus  between  Tak  How's\r\n\nsolicitation  of Kiddie Products' business and Mrs. Nowak's death\r\n\ndoes  not  constitute  a proximate  cause  relationship,  it does\r\n\nrepresent a meaningful  link between  Tak How's  contact and  the\r\n\nharm suffered.   Given these circumstances, we think  it would be\r\n\nimprudent  to reject  jurisdiction  at this  early  stage of  the\r\n\ninquiry.\r\n\n          By this approach, we intend to emphasize the importance\r\n\nof proximate causation,  but to allow a slight  loosening of that\r\n\nstandard when circumstances  dictate.  We think  such flexibility\r\n\nis necessary in  the jurisdictional inquiry:   relatedness cannot\r\n\nmerely be  reduced to  one tort  concept  for all  circumstances.\r\n\nThough we are  recognizing a  narrow exception  to the  proximate\r\n\ncause  test, we  note an  additional  protection for  defendants'\r\n\nrights:  \"the relatedness requirement  . . . authorizes the court\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nto  take  into   account  the  strength  (or   weakness)  of  the\r\n\nplaintiff's relatedness  showing in passing upon  the fundamental\r\n\nfairness of allowing the suit to proceed.\"  Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat 207.\r\n\n          We recognize it  will not always be easy  to apply this\r\n\nflexible  approach to  particular circumstances,  but  that is  a\r\n\nfunction of  the  complexity  of  this  area of  the  law.

The June 1993\r\n\ncorrespondence contained promotional  materials from the  Holiday\r\n\nInn  designed to further entice Kiddie Products employees to stay\r\n\nat the  hotel.

Tak  How had an  obvious financial\r\n\ninterest in  continuing business  with Kiddie  Products, and  the\r\n\nJune 1993  correspondence is  the best example  of an  unprompted\r\n\nsolicitation designed  to facilitate that  business relationship.\r\n\nIn   order  to  be  subject  to  Massachusetts'  jurisdiction,  a\r\n\ndefendant need  only have  one contact with  the forum  state, so\r\n\nlong as that contact is  meaningful.

In  Asahi,  the\r                                                                     \r\n\nquestion of minimum contacts divided  the Court, but eight of the\r\n\nJustices agreed  that exercising personal jurisdiction  would not\r\n\ncomport with notions of fair  play and substantial justice.  This\r\n\nCourt has thus  adopted a sliding scale approach:   \"[T]he weaker\r\n\nthe plaintiff's showing on the first  two prongs (relatedness and\r\n\npurposeful availment), the less a defendant need show in terms of\r\n\nunreasonableness to  defeat jurisdiction.\"  Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat  210.   The  reverse is  equally  true:   a strong  showing of\r\n\nreasonableness may  serve to fortify  a more marginal  showing of\r\n\nrelatedness and  purposefulness.   See id.  (citing Donatelli  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nNational Hockey  League, 893 F.2  459, 465 (1st Cir.  1990)); see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1396.\r                       \r\n\n          1.  The Burden of  Appearance.  It would undoubtedly be\r\n\nburdensome for  Tak How to  defend itself in Massachusetts:   Tak\r\n\nHow's only  place of business  is in Hong  Kong.  This  Court has\r\n\nrecognized,  however, that it  is almost always  inconvenient and\r\n\ncostly  for  a  party  to litigate  in  a  foreign  jurisdiction.\r\n\nPritzker, 42 F.3d at 64.  Thus for this particular gestalt factor\r                  \r\n\nto have  any significance,  the defendant  must demonstrate  that\r\n\n\"exercise of jurisdiction in the present circumstances is onerous\r\n\nin  a special,  unusual,  or  other constitutionally  significant\r\n\nway.\"  Id.  Tak How alleges  nothing special or unusual about its\r                    \r\n\nsituation beyond the ordinary cost and inconvenience of defending\r\n\nan action  so far  from its place  of business.   Under Pritzker,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nthat is not enough:  it simply cannot be the case that every Hong\r\n\nKong corporation is  immune from suit in Massachusetts.   But see\r\n\nTicketmaster,   26  F.3d  at   210  (noting  the   importance  of\r                      \r\n\nconsidering  the distance  the defendant  must  travel in  giving\r\n\nweight to this  factor in the analysis).   We are also  persuaded\r\n\nthat the burden on Tak How will be minimized by, for example, the\r\n\navailability of transcripts  from the Coroner's Court for  use in\r\n\nthe Massachusetts proceeding.\r\n\n          We have also noted that  the burden of appearance is an\r\n\nimportant gestalt factor  primarily because it allows  a court to\r\n\nguard against harassing litigation.  Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 211\r                                                           \r\n\n(citing  Gulf Oil  Corp. v.

Were\r                                             \r\n\nthere any  indication in the  record that the Nowaks  brought the\r\n\npresent  suit to  harass Tak  How,  the burden  of appearance  in\r\n\nMassachusetts might weigh in Tak How's favor; however, the record\r\n\ndoes not so indicate.\r\n\n          2.  Interest of  the Forum.  Although a forum state has\r\n\na significant interest in obtaining jurisdiction over a defendant\r\n\nwho causes tortious  injury within its borders,  Ticketmaster, 26\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  at  211, that  interest  is  diminished  where  the  injury\r\n\noccurred outside  the forum  state.  Sawtelle,  70 F.3d  at 1395.\r                                                       \r\n\nNonetheless, our task is not  to compare the interest of  the two\r\n\nsovereigns -- the place  of the injury and forum state  -- but to\r\n\ndetermine whether the forum state has an interest.  Id.  While it\r                                                                 \r\n\nis true that the injury in this case occurred in Hong Kong, it is\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nequally true (unlike Sawtelle) that significant events took place\r                                       \r\n\nin Massachusetts giving  it an interest in this  litigation.  Tak\r\n\nHow  solicited business  in the  state.   As  the district  court\r\n\nnoted,  Massachusetts has  a strong  interest  in protecting  its\r\n\ncitizens  from out-of-state solicitations  for goods  or services\r\n\nthat prove to be unsafe, and it also has an interest in providing\r\n\nits citizens  with a  convenient forum in  which to  assert their\r\n\nclaims.   Burger King,  471 U.S. at  473.   Given the forum-state\r                               \r\n\nactivities  that took  place  prior  to  Mrs. Nowak's  death,  we\r\n\nconclude that Massachusetts  has a strong interest  in exercising\r\n\njurisdiction even though the injury took place in Hong Kong.\r\n\n          3.    The  Plaintiffs' Convenience.    This  Court must\r\n\naccord deference  to the Nowaks' choice of a Massachusetts forum.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Foster-Miller,  46 F.3d  at 151.   Regardless,  it is\r                                   \r\n\nobvious that  a Massachusetts  forum is more  convenient for  the\r\n\nNowaks  than another  forum,  particularly  a  Hong  Kong  forum.\r\n\nFurther, there  exists substantial  doubt that  the Nowaks  could\r\n\nadequately resolve  the dispute in  Hong Kong:  Hong  Kong's laws\r\n\nregarding contingency fees and posting of security bonds with the\r\n\ncourt  make litigation  economically onerous for  plaintiffs, and\r\n\nthe future of Hong Kong's political system is also uncertain.\r\n\n          4.  The Administration of Justice.  This factor focuses\r\n\non the judicial system's interest in obtaining the most effective\r\n\nresolution of  the controversy.   Usually this factor is  a wash,\r\n\n                               -23-\r\r\n\nTicketmaster, 26 F.3d at 211;  Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1395,  but in\r                                                 \r\n\none case we held that preventing piecemeal litigation might favor\r\n\none jurisdiction over another.  Pritzker, 42 F.3d at 64.  Tak How\r                                                  \r\n\nargues  that a Massachusetts action would require the application\r\n\nof Hong Kong law, the use of interpreters, and the transportation\r\n\nof  key  witnesses  from  Hong  Kong  that  are  not  subject  to\r\n\ncompulsory  process.   On the  other  hand, the  Nowaks point  to\r\n\npossible political instability in Hong Kong as the British Colony\r\n\nprepares  to revert  to Chinese  sovereignty.   Interpreters  and\r\n\ntransportation of  witnesses would  likely also  be necessary  in\r\n\nHong   Kong.    We  conclude  that   the  question  of  efficient\r\n\nadministration  of justice favors  a Massachusetts forum.   Given\r\n\nthe likelihood that the Nowaks would face great obstacles in Hong\r\n\nKong due to possible political  instability, as well as Hong Kong\r\n\nlaws  on contingency fees and security bonds, efficiency concerns\r\n\nrequire a Massachusetts  forum.  See United Elec.  Workers v. 163\r                                                                           \r\n\nPleasant St. Corp.,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601482\"><a href=\"/opinion/601482/united-electrical-radio-and-machine-workers-of-america-ue-v-163/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 46-47 (1st  Cir. 1993) (finding\r                            \r\n\nthat fourth gestalt factor weighed against a foreign jurisdiction\r\n\nwhere \"it  is  far from  clear that  there will  be any  judicial\r\n\nresolution,  let alone the most effective judicial resolution, of\r\n\nthis   controversy\"  if   the   case   could   not   proceed   in\r\n\nMassachusetts).\r\n\n          5.   Pertinent  Policy Arguments.    The final  gestalt\r\n\nfactor addresses  the interests  of the  affected governments  in\r\n\nsubstantive  social policies.   Massachusetts has an  interest in\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nprotecting  its citizens from out-of-state providers of goods and\r\n\nservices as well as affording  its citizens a convenient forum in\r\n\nwhich to bring their claims.  These interests are best  served by\r\n\nthe exercise  of  jurisdiction in  Massachusetts.   On the  other\r\n\nhand, Hong Kong has an interest in protecting visitors to promote\r\n\nand  preserve its tourism industry, in protecting its businesses,\r\n\nand  in providing all parties with a  convenient forum.  Only one\r\n\nof Hong Kong's interests -- protecting its businesses -- might be\r\n\ncompromised  by  a  Massachusetts   forum,  while  Massachusetts'\r\n\nprimary  interest  --   protecting  its  citizens  --   might  be\r\n\ncompromised by  a Hong Kong  forum.   We thus  conclude that  the\r\n\nfinal Gestalt factor tips only slightly in the Nowaks' favor.\r\n\n          On balance, we think the gestalt factors weigh strongly\r\n\nin  favor  of  a   Massachusetts  forum.    When  considered   in\r\n\ncombination with the  Nowaks' adequate showing  on the first  two\r\n\nprongs of the constitutional test, we think that, on the specific\r\n\nfacts of this case, the exercise of jurisdiction in Massachusetts\r\n\nis reasonable and does  not offend the notions  of fair play  and\r\n\nsubstantial  justice.    The  district  court therefore  properly\r\n\ndenied  Tak How's  Rule 12(b)(2)  motion to  dismiss for  lack of\r\n\npersonal jurisdiction.\r\n\n                               III.\r\n\n          Tak  How  next  appeals the  denial  of  its motion  to\r\n\ndismiss  for forum  non conveniens.   The  doctrine of  forum non\r                                                                           \r\n\nconveniens permits  a trial court,  on a discretionary  basis, to\r                    \r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\ndismiss  a case  where an  alternative  forum is  a available  in\r\n\nanother country  that is fair  to the  parties and  substantially\r\n\nmore convenient for them or the courts.

Lumbermens Mut. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104394\"><a href=\"/opinion/104394/koster-v-american-lumbermens-mut-casualty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524.\r                                       \r\n\n          Based on  these principles, we  are unable to  say that\r\n\nthe district  court  abused  its discretion.    Tak  How's  first\r\n\nargument is  that  the district  court failed  to articulate  its\r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\nreasons for  denying the motion to dismiss.   It is true that the\r\n\ndistrict judge  chose to  rule on the  motion orally  rather than\r\n\nissue a written opinion; however, it is apparent from the hearing\r\n\ntranscript  that the judge  considered relevant factors.   Before\r\n\nruling on  the motion,  the judge  questioned  counsel about  the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  right to  have a  jury  trial in  Hong Kong,  and he\r\n\nstated  that granting the  motion would be  outcome determinative\r\n\nbecause,  as a  practical matter  and due  to additional  burdens\r\n\nunder Hong Kong laws,  it would be very difficult  for the Nowaks\r\n\nto bring suit there.  The  hearing transcript is certainly not as\r\n\ndetailed  as  the  written  opinion  denying  the  jurisdictional\r\n\nmotion, but the court was entitled to rule on the motion orally.\r\n\n          The  question here is whether the district court failed\r\n\nto consider  a material factor  or failed to correctly  weigh the\r\n\nfactors.   Given  that Tak  How  has the  burden  of proving  the\r\n\nelements of  forum non  conveniens, we shall  review the  factors\r                                            \r\n\nalleged to justify dismissal that  Tak How has put forth, bearing\r\n\nin mind that  Koster, supra, places a heavy  burden on defendants\r                                     \r\n\nwhere,  as here,  plaintiffs brought  suit in  their home  forum.\r\n\nThere is no question that Hong Kong is an available forum, as Tak\r\n\nHow is subject to  service of process in Hong Kong.   Mercier II,\r                                                                          \r\n\n935 F.2d at 424.   There also appears to be  no dispute that Hong\r\n\nKong would provide an adequate forum in the sense that its courts\r\n\nrecognize a similar cause of action.   Tak How next contends that\r\n\nthe private interest factors of Gilbert, supra, weigh in favor of\r                                                        \r\n\na Hong Kong  forum:  it notes  that it would bear  the expense of\r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\ntransporting witnesses to  the United States, that  it might face\r\n\ndifficulty in  joining third-party defendants in  a Massachusetts\r\n\ncourt, and that a Hong Kong court might not enforce  the judgment\r\n\nof a  Massachusetts court.   These factors do not  constitute the\r\n\ntype   of  \"oppressiveness  and   vexation\"  required  by  Koster\r                                                                           \r\n\ndisproportionate  to the Nowaks'  inconvenience of suing  in Hong\r\n\nKong.  The Nowaks  would also have to transport witnesses to Hong\r\n\nKong and later seek to  enforce a foreign judgment in their  home\r\n\nstate.  In addition, the Nowaks point to private interest factors\r\n\nthat weigh in  their favor:  they would  face financial obstacles\r\n\nbecause Hong  Kong law  prohibits contingent  fee agreements  and\r\n\nrequires that  they deposit  an amount equal  to Tak  How's costs\r\n\nwith  the  court;  also, possible  political  instability  in the\r\n\nregion could add further difficulties to litigation in Hong Kong.\r\n\nRegardless  of  the difficulties  the Nowaks  might face  in Hong\r\n\nKong,  it is  enough that  Tak How  failed to  demonstrate either\r\n\noppressiveness to itself or only a slight or nonexistent interest\r\n\nin convenience on the Nowaks' part.  Koster, 330 U.S. at 524. \r                                                     \r\n\n          Nor  is Tak  How able  to  demonstrate public  interest\r\n\nfactors  that  make  trial in  Massachusetts  inappropriate.   It\r\n\npoints to the fact that Massachusetts choice-of-law rules require\r\n\napplication of Hong Kong law, and that a Hong Kong court would be\r\n\n\"more at home\" with such laws.  This concern is not sufficient to\r\n\novercome  the presumption in  favor of plaintiffs'  chosen forum.\r\n\nThis  Court  has previously  noted  that  \"the  task of  deciding\r\n\nforeign  law [is]  a chore  federal courts  must often  perform.\"\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nMercier III, 981 F.2d at  1357 (quoting Manu Int'l, S.A.  v.
