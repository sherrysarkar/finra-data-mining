Edward Perrotta was convicted of\n\nconspiring     with     Rocco    Folco      and     others    to    make    extortionate\n\nextensions      of    credit,       aiding    and        abetting   Folco     in   making\n\nextortionate     extensions         of    credit,    and     financing      extortionate\n\nextensions of credit made by Folco.                      He appeals on a number of\n\ngrounds. Unconvinced by his arguments, we affirm his convictions.\n\n                                     I. Background\n\n              In April of 1995, Perrotta loaned $50,000 to Folco at an\n\ninterest rate of one percent per week (52 percent per year).\n\nFolco, in turn, loaned the $50,000 to Anthony Regine at an interest\nrate of two percent per week (104 percent per year).                        Under Rhode\nIsland law, annual interest rates in excess of 21 percent are not\nlegally enforceable.           Regine testified, however, that he believed\n\n\"something would happen to me or to my family\" if he failed to make\ntimely payments to Folco.\n              In March of 1999 a grand jury indicted Perrotta, Folco,\n\nand several others on various racketeering-related charges.                            The\nindictment      charged       that       Perrotta    had     financed       extortionate\nextensions     of     credit    from      Folco     to    Regine,    in    violation    of\n18 U.S.C. § 893.        Most of the defendants pled guilty.                  In March of\n\n2000    the   grand    jury     returned      a    superceding      indictment      which\n\nincluded the original count against Perrotta and also charged that\n\nhe    had   conspired    with       Folco    and    others    to    make    extortionate\n\nextensions of credit to Regine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 892,\n\nand    that    Perrotta       had    aided     and       abetted    Folco    in    making\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fextortionate extensions of credit, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 892\n\nand § 2 (the general aiding and abetting statute).\n\n             Perrotta moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground\nthat § 893    (proscribing the advancement of money to a person \"with\n\nreasonable grounds to believe\" that person intends to use it to\n\nmake an extortionate extension of credit) encourages the jury to\nuse a standard of proof less exacting than \"beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt,\" in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe district court denied his motion.           Perrotta also moved to\n\nsuppress weapons seized from his home and car which had not been\n\ndescribed in the search warrant, and that motion was also denied.\n\nIn addition, Perrotta objected unsuccessfully (in a motion in\n\nlimine and at trial) to the admission into evidence of the seized\nweapons.     After the jury convicted Perrotta on all charges, the\n\ncourt denied his earlier motions for a judgment of acquittal and\n\nsentenced Perrotta to 37 months in prison.\n             On   appeal,   Perrotta   argues   that   the   evidence   was\n\ninsufficient to support his convictions, that the district court\n\nerred in admitting into evidence weapons seized during a search of\n\nhis home and car, that the seizure of the weapons violated the\n\nFourth Amendment, and that 18 U.S.C. § 893 invites confusion in the\n\napplication of the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard and is\n\ntherefore unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f                      II. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\nA. The Charges\n\n              Under 18 U.S.C. § 892, \"Whoever makes any extortionate\n\nextension of credit, or conspires to do so, shall be fined . . . or\nimprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\"                    Federal law also\n\nproscribes \"willfully advanc[ing] money . . . to any person, with\n\nreasonable grounds to believe that it is the intention of that\nperson   to    use   the   money   .   .    .    for   the    purpose    of   making\n\nextortionate extensions of credit . . . .\"                   18 U.S.C. § 893.     An\n\n\"extortionate extension of credit\" is\n              [a]ny extension of credit with respect to\n              which it is the understanding of the creditor\n              and the debtor at the time it is made that\n              delay in making repayment or failure to make\n              repayment could result in the use of violence\n              or other criminal means to cause harm to the\n              person, reputation, or property of any person.\n18 U.S.C. § 891(6).          Recognizing that direct evidence of the\nunderstanding of the parties concerning the consequences of delayed\n\nrepayment or non-repayment may be difficult to obtain, Congress\nenumerated four factors which, if all present, would constitute\n\"prima   facie       evidence   that       the    extension      of     credit   was\nextortionate.\"       18 U.S.C. § 892(b).           The factors are \"(1) that\n\nrepayment is unenforceable through civil judicial process; (2) that\n\nthe loan requires interest greater than 45% per year; (3) that the\n\nloan exceeds $100; and (4) that the debtor reasonably believes that\n\nthe lender either has used [extortionate means] to collect other\n\ndebts or has a reputation for doing so.\"               United States v. Zannino,\n\n895 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir. 1990) (summarizing 18 U.S.C. § 892(b)).\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           Instead of alleging that Perrotta's loan to Folco was\n\nextortionate, the government tried to implicate Perrotta as a\n\nparticipant in Folco's extortionate loan to Regine.             Count One of\nthe indictment charged that Perrotta had conspired with Folco to\n\nmake extortionate extensions of credit to Regine, in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 892.    To win a conviction on this count, the government\nhad to prove that Perrotta and Folco agreed and intended that Folco\n\nwould make an extortionate extension of credit to Regine (that is,\n\nthat Regine would understand that Folco would, if necessary, resort\n\nto violence or other criminal means to collect).            United States v.\n\nEscobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 175 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"To prove the\n\nelements of   a    conspiracy,    the   government   must    show   beyond   a\n\nreasonable doubt that the defendant and one or more coconspirators\nintended to agree and . . . to commit the substantive criminal\n\noffense   which    was   the   object   of   their   unlawful    agreement.\"\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).\n           Count Three charged that Perrotta had aided and abetted\n\nFolco in making extortionate extensions of credit to Regine, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 892 and § 2.         To win a conviction on this\n\ncount, the government was required to prove that Perrotta knew that\n\nFolco's extensions of credit to Regine were extortionate and that\n\nPerrotta intended to assist Folco in making the extortionate loans.\n\nSee United States v. Rosario-Diaz, 202 F.3d 54, 62 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(to support a conviction for aiding and abetting, the government\n\nmust prove, in addition to the commission of the offense by the\n\nprincipal, that the defendant \"consciously shared the principal's\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fknowledge of the underlying criminal act, and intended to help the\n\nprincipal.\").\n\n            Count Two charged Perrotta with financing extortionate\nextensions of credit from Folco to Regine in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 893.   To win a conviction on this count, the government had to\n\nestablish    that   Perrotta      had    advanced    money       to    Folco     with\n\"reasonable grounds to believe\" that Folco would use the money to\n\nmake an extortionate extension of credit.             Id.    If we conclude in\n\nevaluating the evidence that it was sufficient to establish that\n\nPerrotta knew of Folco's extortionate practices, we necessarily\n\nalso conclude that he had reasonable grounds to believe that Folco\n\nwould employ such practices.\n\n            Perrotta does not deny having loaned $50,000 to Folco, or\nthat Folco then loaned the $50,000 to Regine.               Nor does he dispute\n\nthe government's claim that Folco's loan of $50,000 to Regine was\n\nextortionate.       His   sole    contention    is   that    the      evidence    was\ninsufficient \"to support a finding that Mr. Perrotta knew of the\n\nintention   of   Mr.    Folco    to   employ   violence     in   his    collection\n\nefforts.\"\n\nB. Folco as Loan Shark\n\n            In weighing Perrotta's challenge to the sufficiency of\nthe evidence against him, we view the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the verdict, and draw all reasonable inferences in\n\nfavor of the verdict.        United States v. Benjamin, 252 F.3d 1, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).       There was ample evidence at trial that Folco was\n\na loan shark, including a notebook in which Folco had recorded the\n\n                                        -6-\n\fprincipal amount, interest rate, and payment schedule of over a\n\ndozen debts owed to him.   The interest Folco charged on these loans\n\nwas two to three percent per week.     There was extensive evidence\nthat it was Folco's practice to use violence and threats of\n\nviolence to collect debts.    For example, Folco explained to Gary\n\nCedroni (a Folco associate) that one of his debt collectors, who\nhad \"just got out of the can\" and was \"half fucking nuts,\" would\n\n\"crack\" a debtor in order to \"scare him enough\" to secure payment.1\nIn a second conversation, Folco told Cedroni that one of his debt\n\ncollectors had \"cracked [a debtor] on the mouth\" on Folco's behalf\n\nand said \"'You better have the money by six o'clock or else.'\"   In\n\na third conversation, George Melillo (another Folco associate)\n\nindicated to Folco that the next time he encountered a certain\ndebtor, Melillo would \"smash him in the mouth . . . [k]nock him out\n\ncold.\"   Folco suggested that the debtor be warned that if payment\n\nwas not made within a week, he and his father would get \"a\nbeating.\"   The surveillance tapes contained several other accounts\n\nof Folco's extortionate techniques.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n        The conversations quoted in this opinion were obtained by\nmeans of electronic listening devices installed in Folco's home and\na wiretap on Folco's telephone. (The government also installed a\nhidden camera outside Folco's home.) The government transcribed\nthese conversations to assist the jury in understanding the\nsurveillance tapes.      Although it was the tapes, not the\ntranscripts, that were admitted into evidence, our review was\nlimited to the transcripts. At certain points in the transcripts\nPerrotta disputes the government's version of what was said, and we\nhave noted those disputes.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fC. The Transactions\n\n           On April 22, 1995, Folco agreed to loan Regine $25,000 at\n\nan interest rate of two percent per week.    Regine needed this money\n\nto pay off other loan sharks who were charging him even higher\n\nrates of interest.2   Folco told Regine that he would get the money\n\nfrom a third party, who turned out to be Perrotta, and Regine\n\nexpressed his understanding that Folco would \"charge me a point,\"\n\nthat is, one percent per week, on top of the interest the third\n\nparty (Perrotta) would be charging Folco.\n\n           On April 24, Folco told Cedroni that he had said to \"the\nold man\" (Perrotta was 52 years old in 1995) that he \"might\n\nneed . . . 50,000 more.\"   Folco reported that he had asked Perrotta\n\"who am I gonna go to if I need that kind of money?\", and \"the old\nman\" had responded: \"Me! Come to me. . . .    I'll give you anything\n\nyou want.\"      That same day, Perrotta telephoned Folco, and the\nfollowing conversation ensued:\n           Perrotta: Hey, I got you a putter for ya.\n           Folco: Yeah.\n           Perrotta: Do you want me to bring it over\n           tomorrow?\n\n           Folco: Yeah.\nThey agreed that Perrotta would deliver the \"putter\" at 8:30 the\n\nnext morning.    Also on April 24, Folco told Regine \"[o]ne guy is\ngonna give me 25 G's tomorrow morning.\"     Folco also indicated that\nhe could get Regine an additional $25,000 in the near future.\n\n\n     2\n         Regine also had a pre-existing debt to Folco of $80,000.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          At    8:19   a.m.   on   April   25,   Folco    told   Regine   (by\n\ntelephone) \"that guy's coming at eight thirty . . . .            He's gonna\n\nbring me that -- package.\"         Perrotta arrived at Folco's home at\n8:33, without a golf putter.        Perrotta asked Folco, \"You want to\n\ncount it?\"     Folco replied, \"No, no, I'll let him [presumably\n\nRegine] count it . . . .      There is 25 there?\"3       Perrotta indicated\nthat there was.    Folco explained his understanding of the terms of\n\nthe loan: \"that'll be 250 [one percent of $25,000) I'll give you\n\nevery Tuesday.\"    Perrotta indicated his assent.\n\n          Three minutes after Perrotta departed, Regine arrived at\n\nFolco's residence.     He thanked Folco and explained that he would\n\n\"take it [the $25,000] to . . . Joe,\" another loan shark to whom\n\nRegine was indebted at an even higher rate of interest.               In an\napparent reference to the second $25,000 loan which Folco and\n\nRegine had discussed, Folco said: \"I talked to a guy, gonna get\n\nback to me.    Gave me the bullshit, Jesus, ahh . . . I want a point\nand a half [one and a half percent], he give me that shit.\"           Folco\n\ntold Regine that he had rejected this proposal, but that he\n\nexpected to hear from the \"guy\" before the end of the week.\n\n          Indeed, Perrotta phoned Folco two days later about a\n\nsecond \"putter\":\n\n          Perrotta: You didn't like that, you didn't\n          like that ah that putter I got yah, I got you\n          another one.\n\n     3\n      According to the government's transcript of the surveillance\ntape, Folco made a second reference to Regine, who drove a beige\nInfinity, in this conversation: \"You probably seen the car. Ah, a\nbeige Infin-Infinity.\" Perrotta disputes this interpretation of\nthe tape, hearing instead a reference to a beige couch.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          Folco: Alright.\n\n          Perrotta: You know and then you you whichever\n          one you like ah you keep and ah the one you\n          don't like you can give it to me back so I can\n          give it to somebody else.\n\n          Folco: I'll be here.\nLater that day, Perrotta showed up at Folco's residence, again\n\nwithout a golf putter.    In what the jury could have found was a\n\nreference to the schedule for interest payments, Folco said to\n\nPerrotta \"[e]very Wednesday,\" and there was evidence that Folco and\n\nPerrotta in fact met on subsequent Wednesdays.     Folco also said\n\n\"I'll be like ten weeks, that's all,\" which the jury could have\n\nfound was a statement of the term of the loan.\n          The following day Regine came to Folco's home.     Folco\n\nreported that \"[t]he guy that brought me the money yesterday[]\" had\n\nsupplied \"[a]ll twenties.\"     The two men counted the money and\ndetermined that it indeed amounted to \"25 thousand.\"        Regine\n\npromised to pay Folco \"the other five [hundred] [two percent of\n\n$25,000] Tuesdays\" (earlier in the conversation he had reiterated\n\nhis existing obligation to give Folco \"five\" on Tuesday for the\n\noriginal $25,000).   In other words, Folco got his money on Tuesday\n\nand Perrotta got his on Wednesday.\n\n          Consistent with the evidence summarized above, a notebook\n\nfound in Folco's residence contained entries that the jury could\n\nhave found were a record of two loans of $25,000 each from Perrotta\n\nto Folco. FBI expert Jerome Simpson offered the opinion that these\n\nloans, at an interest rate of one percent per week -- \"below the\n\nrate of all of the other loans in this [notebook], and . . . below\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe rate of any other loan that I've ever seen for a loan shark to\n\nmake, putting money out on the street\" -- were probably loans from\n\none loan shark to another.     As Folco explained his financial\narrangements to Regine, \"the guys I go see that lend money, I\n\nguarantee that money out.\"\n\n          This was not the first time Perrotta had advanced money\nto Folco, as evidenced by the following conversation between Folco\n\nand Eddie Lato, one of his \"business\" partners:\n\n          Lato: You know, what he [Perrotta] does\n          sometimes . . . you ask him for two [thousand]\n          he freezes. He's got something about . . . I\n          don't know if he thinks you're gonna try and\n          rob him. . . .\n\n          Folco: Today it wasn't that.     Last time I\n          asked him, \"Ya, anything you want?\" Took ten\n          off him, remember.\"4\n\nIn addition, Folco made reference in a recorded conversation to an\n\nearlier \"deal\" he had done (for \"a point\") with the source of the\n\n$50,000 he was lending to Regine.\n\nD. The Seizure of Perrotta's Cash and Weapons\n\n          A search conducted on June 23, 1995, turned up $4,703 in\ncash on Perrotta's person, $4,800 in cash around Perrotta's house,\ntwo handguns and ammunition in a nightstand in a first-floor\n\nbedroom, a third handgun, brass knuckles, a fake bomb in Perrotta's\ngarage, and a billy club in his car.   The next day, Folco had the\nfollowing conversation with Lato:\n\n\n\n     4\n        Perrotta's  version  of  this  exchange  denotes as\nunintelligible Folco's final five words (\"Took ten off him,\nremember.\")\n\n                               -11-\n\f           Lato: Um.    Perrotta, they got.       I'm afraid.\n\n           Folco: What they [unintelligible] on him?\n\n           Lato: Bombs, guns, everything.\n           Folco:     He     ain't      worried           about\n           [unintelligible].    If he blows up.             Hm.\n           [Unintelligible] he's dead.5\n\nLato then informed Folco that (presumably the police) \"[t]ook 10\noff of Perrotta,\" consistent with the seizure the day before of\n\n$9503 from Perrotta.    Lato reported that he had spoken to Perrotta\n\nafter the raid, and that either he or Perrotta had said to the\n\nother:   \"it's   over   for    us.\"6      Folco   expressed   concern   that\n\n\"[s]omebody will rat.\"        Lato agreed: \"And they gonna say that we,\n\nwe, we bankrolled the whole fucking thing.\"\n\nE. The Evidence of Perrotta's Knowledge of Folco's \"Business\"\n\n           First, there was evidence tending to show that Perrotta\n\nhad repeated dealings with Folco in relation to Folco's money-\nlending operation.      The jury could have inferred from Folco's\nreport to Cedroni that he had told \"the old man\" that he \"might\n\nneed . . . 50,000 more\" (emphasis added) that Perrotta was an\n\nongoing participant in Folco's loan sharking business.            The same\ninference is supported by Folco's reference to a previous \"deal\" he\n\n\n\n     5\n        Perrotta's version of this conversation denotes as\nunintelligible Folco's final remarks, transcribed by the government\nas \"If he blows up. Hm. [Unintelligible] he's dead.\"\n     6\n        The jury could have so interpreted the following statement\nby Lato to Folco: \"Took 10 off of Perrotta.     BREAK (2 seconds)\n[unintelligible] were, were all the time saying it's over for us.\nThey took a shot at us huh. I was with him last night. He call me\nup. He said uh, will you come by and take me for a ride?\"\n\n                                       -12-\n\fhad done with the source of the $50,000, and by the conversation in\n\nwhich Lato and Folco discussed what Perrotta \"sometimes\" does when\n\nasked for money. Based on this evidence, the jury could have\nconcluded that Perrotta was more than an unwitting, peripheral\n\nparticipant in Folco's loan sharking business.                      That inference\n\ncould have been reinforced for the jury by the concern Lato\nexpressed to Folco, after the search of Perrotta's home, that \"they\n\ngot\" Perrotta, \"I'm afraid\" (\"[b]ombs, guns, everything\"), and by\n\nthe statement by Lato or Perrotta that \"it's all over for us.\"\n\n           Second, if the jury found that Perrotta knew that Folco\n\nwas   re-lending   the    $50,000      to   a    third    person    --   as   Folco's\n\nstatement to Perrotta, \"I'll let him [presumably Regine] count it\n\n[the money Perrotta had just delivered],\" suggests -- it could also\nhave concluded that Perrotta must have realized that Folco and that\n\nperson   understood      that    violence       or   other   criminal    collection\n\ntechniques might be used.            This is because, for Folco to turn a\nprofit, he would have had to charge interest in excess of the one\n\npercent per week he was paying Perrotta, which would make the\n\nobligation legally unenforceable in Rhode Island.                        See United\n\nStates v. Oreto, 37 F.3d 739, 752-53 (1st Cir. 1994) (fact that\n\nloan was \"grossly usurious\" was a factor indicating violence might\n\nbe used to collect).            The jury could have credited Simpson's\n\ntestimony that, in his opinion, the loan from Perrotta to Folco at\n\nthe relatively low rate of one percent per week \"was probably a\n\nloan from one loan shark to another,\" and that Folco's role in the\n\ntransactions   was,      as     he   explained       to   Regine,   to   \"guarantee\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f[Perrotta's] money out.\"         If the jury believed that Perrotta\n\nhimself was a loan shark, it could have reasoned that he must have\n\nrealized   that   Folco   was   one    too,   and   that   Folco   might   use\nextortionate methods to collect the $50,000 he had borrowed from\n\nPerrotta and loaned to Regine.\n\n           In sum, while there was no direct evidence that Perrotta\n\nunderstood the extortionate nature of Folco's transactions with\n\nRegine, there is enough circumstantial evidence to support a jury\n\nfinding that he must have realized how Folco would enforce, if\n\nnecessary, Regine's repayment obligations.\n\n                    III. Admission of the Weapons\n\n           Perrotta filed a pre-trial motion in limine \"to exclude,\nas evidence against him, all tangible evidence seized from his\nresidence as such evidence is inadmissible pursuant to Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 404(b) and introduction of the same would deny the\ndefendant the fair trial to which he is entitled.\"            At the motion\nhearing, Perrotta argued that introduction of the guns, brass\n\nknuckles, billy club, and fake bomb would be \"highly prejudicial.\"\nThose items, he contended, are \"irrelevant to the crimes charged\nand will clearly result in the [j]ury being invited to convict Mr.\n\nPerrotta . . . because . . . of bad character or things that the\n[j]ury in this climate will not like -- possession of firearms\nand . . . other weapons.\"       The district court denied the motion.\n\n           At trial, police officers testified to the discovery of\nthe guns, brass knuckles, and fake bomb in Perrotta's residence,\n\nand the billy club in Perrotta's car.          Except with respect to the\n\n                                      -14-\n\fbrass knuckles, Perrotta made no objection to this testimony.   Nor\n\ndid he raise a 404(b) objection to the recorded conversation in\n\nwhich Lato said to Folco \"they got\" Perrotta, \"[b]ombs, guns,\neverything.\"7     However, when the government requested that the\n\nseized items be marked as exhibits, Perrotta objected on the ground\n\nof \"relevance.\"\n          On appeal, Perrotta argues that the district court should\n\nhave excluded the weapons under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) as evidence of\n\nother crimes, wrongs, or acts, or because their probative value was\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under\n\nFed. R. Evid. 403.8\n\n          To admit evidence of [other] bad acts, a trial\n          court must find that the evidence passes two\n          tests. First, the evidence must have 'special\n          relevance' to an issue in the case . . . , and\n          must not include \"bad character or propensity\n          as a necessary link in the inferential chain.\"\n          Second, under Rule 403, evidence that is\n          specially relevant may still be excluded if\n          its    probative   value    is   substantially\n          outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nUnited States v. Varoudakis, 233 F.3d 113, 118 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(quoting United States v. Frankhauser, 80 F.3d 641, 648 (1st Cir.\n\n1996)).   We review the district court's evidentiary rulings for\n\nabuse of discretion.    United States v. Gilbert, 181 F.3d 152, 160\n\n(1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n     7\n        At trial, Perrotta objected to the Folco-Lato conversation\non hearsay grounds. He does not pursue his hearsay argument on\nappeal.\n     8\n        On appeal, Perrotta does not renew his objection to the\ntestimony about the brass knuckles.\n\n                                -15-\n\fA. Rule 404(b)\n\n            Although Perrotta argues that the weapons had none of the\n\nspecial relevance to the charges against him required by Rule\n\n404(b), he did not challenge the police testimony that the weapons\n\nwere   found    in    his   possession.      Nor   did    he    challenge   Lato's\n\n\"[b]ombs, guns, everything\" remark on special relevance grounds.\n\nThus, even if we were to conclude that the introduction of the\n\nactual weapons lacked the special relevance required by the rule\n\nand only served to create a negative inference about Perrotta's\n\ncharacter, we would have to consider the important fact that\nevidence about Perrotta's possession of the weapons was already in\n\nthe case because of the testimony to which Perrotta did not object\non 404(b) grounds.          \"Under Fed. R. Evid. 103(a), this court must\nreview a challenged evidentiary decision to determine whether 'a\n\nsubstantial right of the party is affected.'\" Doty v. Sewall, 908\n\nF.2d 1053, 1057 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)).                We\nhave held that \"no substantial right of the party is affected where\n\nthe    evidence      admitted   was   cumulative     as    to    other   admitted\nevidence.\"     Id. To the extent that Perrotta was concerned that the\n\nadmission of the weapons into evidence wrongly alerted the jury to\n\nthe fact that he had possessed them, any such error would be\nharmless.      The jury already knew that fact from the testimony of\nwitnesses about the weapons.\n\n            For the sake of completeness, however, and to dispel any\nnotion of unfairness surrounding the admission of the testimony\n\nabout the weapons, we add that if Perrotta had objected to the\n\n                                      -16-\n\ftestimony about the weapons, and had not limited his objection to\n\ntheir introduction into evidence, his objection would have been\n\nmeritless.      Testimony about the discovery of the guns, brass\nknuckles, billy club, and fake bomb in Perrotta's home and car had\n\nthe special relevance to the government's case required by Rule\n\n404(b).    In a conversation recorded the day after the search of\nPerrotta's home and car, Lato said to Folco that he was \"afraid\"\n\nthat \"[b]ombs, guns, everything\" had been taken from Perrotta. The\n\nFolco-Lato conversation in all of its detail was probative of the\n\nrelationship between Perrotta and Folco, revealing an alarmed\n\nreaction by Folco and Lato to the investigation of Perrotta, and\n\nthereby suggesting that Perrotta was a significant player in their\n\nloansharking operation.         In addition, their awareness of the\ndetails of the seizure from Perrotta so soon after it happened was\n\nfurther evidence of their close relationship with him.           Perrotta's\n\ncontention that the weapons had no relevance except to support a\nnegative inference about his character is therefore without merit.\n\n             The government also argues that the seized weapons were\n\nrelevant generally as \"tools of the trade\" of extortion because\n\nthey are useful to protect the lender and intimidate borrowers, and\n\nthus they tend to show that Perrotta was a loan shark.                We have\n\nsaid that \"in drug trafficking firearms have become 'tools of the\n\ntrade'    and   thus   are   probative    of   the   existence   of   a   drug\n\nconspiracy.\"     United States v. Green, 887 F.2d 25, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).    The government urges us to extend the \"tools of the trade\"\n\nrationale for the admission of weapons to the crime of extortion,\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\freasoning that weapons are tools of the loan shark's trade just as\n\nthey are tools of the drug dealer's trade, and thus are probative\n\nof loan sharking activity. United States v. Gilley, 836 F.2d 1206,\n1214 n.9 (9th Cir. 1988) (noting that the \"tools of the trade\"\n\ndoctrine might be applicable to extortion).      The district court\n\nappeared to endorse the government's \"tools of the trade\" theory in\ndenying Perrotta's motion to exclude the weapons.      In our view,\n\nhowever, there are three reasons why this was a poor case for the\n\ngovernment to urge extending the tools of the trade doctrine to the\n\ncrime of extortion: (1) the government does not claim that Perrotta\n\nhimself used threats of violence to enforce debts owed to him; (2)\n\nthere was little left of Perrotta's relevance objection after he\n\ndid not object to the testimony about the weapons; and (3) the\nweapons had a case-specific relevance to the charges against\n\nPerrotta that we have already described.     See Gilley, 836 F.2d at\n\n1214 n.9 (\"Where, as here, a clear nexus exists between the\nevidence and the crime charged, no resort need be made to the\n\n'tools of the trade' doctrine.\").     Because resort to the tools of\nthe trade doctrine was unnecessary in this case, we do not address\n\nthe merits of the government's argument.\n\nB. Rule 403\n\n          Perrotta also argues that the weapons should have been\nexcluded under Rule 403, as their probative value was substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.     Since the jury was\nnot being asked to make any specific determinations concerning the\n\nphysical characteristics of the weapons, we discern no particular\n\n                               -18-\n\freason why the jury needed to see the actual weapons.          However, it\n\nis a commonplace of trial practice that testimony about physical\n\nobjects often leads to their introduction into evidence.               That\nintroduction   serves   to     corroborate   the   testimony   about   the\n\nexistence of the objects, a purpose captured by the familiar phrase\n\n\"seeing is believing.\"9      This added increment of probative value is\nappropriate unless it is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice to the defendant. Fed. R. Evid. 403; see also\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (\"[A]ll evidence is meant to be prejudicial; it is only\n\nunfair prejudice which must be avoided.\" (emphasis in original)).\n\n          \"'[O]nly rarely -- and in extraordinarily compelling\n\ncircumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold appellate\nrecord, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning\n\nthe relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Pitrone, 115 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1997)(quoting\n\nFreeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n\nHere, the government has been unable to explain why the jury needed\n\nto see the actual weapons, beyond the usual corroborative purpose\n\n     9\n        See 2 McCormick on Evidence § 212 (5th ed. 1999) (\"Since\n'seeing is believing,' and demonstrative evidence appeals directly\nto the senses of the trier of fact, it is today universally felt\nthat this kind of evidence possesses an immediacy and reality which\nendow it with particularly persuasive effect.\" (footnote omitted)).\nOf course, McCormick is not the author of this phrase, which the\nSecond Circuit has described as \"[a] proverb current even in the\ndays of ancient Rome.\" Coca-Cola Co. v. Tropicana Products, Inc.,\n690 F.2d 312, 314 (2d Cir. 1982); see also Johnson v. United\nStates, 162 F.2d 562, 563 (9th Cir. 1947) (\"well-known maxim\");\nO'Leary v. Liggett Drug Co., 150 F.2d 656, 666 (6th Cir. 1945)\n(\"common-sense adage\"). But see Finley v. Marathon Oil Co., 75\nF.3d 1225, 1231 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"misleading old saw\").\n\n                                   -19-\n\fserved by the introduction of the objects themselves.    By the same\n\ntoken, however, we see no unfair prejudice from the introduction of\n\nthe guns and the fake bomb into evidence.       The district court\ninstructed the jury that there was no evidence that Perrotta had\n\npossessed the guns illegally, and there was testimony that the bomb\n\nwas a fake.    Nothing in the record suggests that the guns or the\nfake bomb would have inflamed the jury or inspired them to decide\n\nthe case on an emotional basis.     See Varoudakis, 233 F.3d at 122\n\n(\"Usually, courts use the term 'unfair prejudice' for evidence that\n\ninvites the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional\n\nbasis.\").\n\n            Similarly, although the brass knuckles and billy club\n\nwere surely unfamiliar items to the jurors,10 and were real rather\nthan fake, we again see nothing in the record to suggest that the\n\nbrass knuckles and billy club would have inflamed the jury to\n\ndecide the case on an emotional basis.       See id.    We therefore\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its broad discretion\n\nin admitting the weapons seized from Perrotta into evidence.\n\n                   IV. Suppression of the Weapons\n\n            Perrotta argues that the seizure of his weapons violated\n\nthe Fourth Amendment because the weapons were not described in the\nsearch warrant.     His argument ignores the plain view doctrine,\nwhich permits the seizure of items located in plain view if \"(1)\n\nthe seizing officer has a prior justification for being in a\n\n\n     10\n        The possession of brass knuckles and billy clubs is illegal\nin Rhode Island. The jurors, however, were not so advised.\n\n                                -20-\n\fposition to see the item in plain view and (2) the evidentiary\n\nvalue of the item is immediately apparent.\"       United States v.\n\nOwens, 167 F.3d 739, 746 (1st Cir. 1999).      Evidentiary value is\n\"immediately apparent\" if there are \"enough facts for a reasonable\n\nperson to believe that the items in plain view may be contraband or\n\nevidence of a crime.\"   United States v. Hamie, 165 F.3d 80, 83 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n          Perrotta fails to explain why the plain view exception is\n\ninapplicable to this case. The search was conducted pursuant to an\n\ninvestigation of a loansharking conspiracy that used violence to\n\nenforce repayment obligations.    The officers had reason to believe\n\nthat the weapons could have evidentiary value in connection with\n\ntheir investigation, as Perrotta could have used the weapons to\ncollect debts or to protect his cash.   It makes no difference that\n\nthe weapons were not used to commit the crimes for which Perrotta\n\nwas convicted; the Fourth Amendment requires simply that the\ninvestigators, at the time of the seizure, had reasonable grounds\n\nto believe that the items \"may [have been] contraband or evidence\n\nof a crime.\"11   Id.\n\n                           V. Due Process\n\n          Perrotta argues that 18 U.S.C. § 893 violates the Due\nProcess Clause of the United States Constitution in proscribing the\nadvancement of money to a person \"with reasonable grounds to\n\n\n\n     11\n         The justification for the seizure of the billy club and\nbrass knuckes is even more straightforward: these items are illegal\nin Rhode Island.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fbelieve\" that the person intends to use the money to make an\n\nextortionate extension of credit.            Perrotta's position is that the\n\nquoted language \"invites confusion in the application of the\n'beyond a reasonable doubt' standard, and could easily lead the\n\njury to convict under this statute if the jury has 'reasonable\n\ngrounds' to believe the Defendant is guilty.\"\n              Perrotta cites no precedent that supports his view of\n\n§ 893, or of its implications for any of the other federal statutes\n\nthat include the same or similar language.               See, e.g., 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2388(c) (activities affecting armed forces during war) (punishing\n\n\"[w]hoever harbors or conceals any person who he knows, or has\n\nreasonable grounds to believe or suspect, has committed . . .                   an\n\noffense       under     this    section\")    (emphasis    added);     18   U.S.C.\n§ 1030(a)(1) (punishing, inter alia, whoever \"having knowingly\n\naccessed a computer without authorization . . . and by means of\n\nsuch conduct having obtained information that has been determined\nby the United States Government . . . to require protection against\n\nunauthorized disclosure, . . . with reason to believe that such\n\ninformation so obtained could be used to the injury of the United\n\nStates, . . . willfully communicates, delivers, transmits, or\n\ncauses to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted . . . the same\n\nto any person not entitled to receive it\") (emphasis added); 18\n\nU.S.C.    §    842(c)    (\"It   shall   be   unlawful    for   any   licensee   to\n\ndistribute explosive materials to any person who the licensee has\n\nreason to believe intends to transport such explosive materials\n\ninto a State where the purchase, possession, or use of explosive\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fmaterials is prohibited. . . .\") (emphasis added).     Nor does he\n\nexplain why the government is wrong to suggest that \"Congress\n\nsurely has the power to adopt different standards of intent for the\nmens rea elements of federal crimes, so long as the jury must find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with the given\n\nlevel of intent in committing the crime.\"    In the absence of any\nexplanation, his argument verges on the frivolous.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -23-\n\f",

Edward Perrotta was convicted of\n\nconspiring     with     Rocco    Folco      and     others    to    make    extortionate\n\nextensions      of    credit,       aiding    and        abetting   Folco     in   making\n\nextortionate     extensions         of    credit,    and     financing      extortionate\n\nextensions of credit made by Folco.                      He appeals on a number of\n\ngrounds. Unconvinced by his arguments, we affirm his convictions.\n\n                                     I. Background\n\n              In April of 1995, Perrotta loaned $50,000 to Folco at an\n\ninterest rate of one percent per week (52 percent per year).\n\nFolco, in turn, loaned the $50,000 to Anthony Regine at an interest\nrate of two percent per week (104 percent per year).                        Under Rhode\nIsland law, annual interest rates in excess of 21 percent are not\nlegally enforceable.           Regine testified, however, that he believed\n\n\"something would happen to me or to my family\" if he failed to make\ntimely payments to Folco.\n              In March of 1999 a grand jury indicted Perrotta, Folco,\n\nand several others on various racketeering-related charges.                            The\nindictment      charged       that       Perrotta    had     financed       extortionate\nextensions     of     credit    from      Folco     to    Regine,    in    violation    of\n18 U.S.C. § 893.        Most of the defendants pled guilty.                  In March of\n\n2000    the   grand    jury     returned      a    superceding      indictment      which\n\nincluded the original count against Perrotta and also charged that\n\nhe    had   conspired    with       Folco    and    others    to    make    extortionate\n\nextensions of credit to Regine, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 892,\n\nand    that    Perrotta       had    aided     and       abetted    Folco    in    making\n\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fextortionate extensions of credit, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 892\n\nand § 2 (the general aiding and abetting statute).\n\n             Perrotta moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground\nthat § 893    (proscribing the advancement of money to a person \"with\n\nreasonable grounds to believe\" that person intends to use it to\n\nmake an extortionate extension of credit) encourages the jury to\nuse a standard of proof less exacting than \"beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt,\" in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.\n\nThe district court denied his motion.           Perrotta also moved to\n\nsuppress weapons seized from his home and car which had not been\n\ndescribed in the search warrant, and that motion was also denied.\n\nIn addition, Perrotta objected unsuccessfully (in a motion in\n\nlimine and at trial) to the admission into evidence of the seized\nweapons.     After the jury convicted Perrotta on all charges, the\n\ncourt denied his earlier motions for a judgment of acquittal and\n\nsentenced Perrotta to 37 months in prison.\n             On   appeal,   Perrotta   argues   that   the   evidence   was\n\ninsufficient to support his convictions, that the district court\n\nerred in admitting into evidence weapons seized during a search of\n\nhis home and car, that the seizure of the weapons violated the\n\nFourth Amendment, and that 18 U.S.C. § 893 invites confusion in the\n\napplication of the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard and is\n\ntherefore unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f                      II. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\nA. The Charges\n\n              Under 18 U.S.C. § 892, \"Whoever makes any extortionate\n\nextension of credit, or conspires to do so, shall be fined . . . or\nimprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.\"                    Federal law also\n\nproscribes \"willfully advanc[ing] money . . . to any person, with\n\nreasonable grounds to believe that it is the intention of that\nperson   to    use   the   money   .   .    .    for   the    purpose    of   making\n\nextortionate extensions of credit . . . .\"                   18 U.S.C. § 893.     An\n\n\"extortionate extension of credit\" is\n              [a]ny extension of credit with respect to\n              which it is the understanding of the creditor\n              and the debtor at the time it is made that\n              delay in making repayment or failure to make\n              repayment could result in the use of violence\n              or other criminal means to cause harm to the\n              person, reputation, or property of any person.\n18 U.S.C. § 891(6).          Recognizing that direct evidence of the\nunderstanding of the parties concerning the consequences of delayed\n\nrepayment or non-repayment may be difficult to obtain, Congress\nenumerated four factors which, if all present, would constitute\n\"prima   facie       evidence   that       the    extension      of     credit   was\nextortionate.\"       18 U.S.C. § 892(b).           The factors are \"(1) that\n\nrepayment is unenforceable through civil judicial process; (2) that\n\nthe loan requires interest greater than 45% per year; (3) that the\n\nloan exceeds $100; and (4) that the debtor reasonably believes that\n\nthe lender either has used [extortionate means] to collect other\n\ndebts or has a reputation for doing so.\"               United States v.

There was ample evidence at trial that Folco was\n\na loan shark, including a notebook in which Folco had recorded the\n\n                                        -6-\n\fprincipal amount, interest rate, and payment schedule of over a\n\ndozen debts owed to him.   The interest Folco charged on these loans\n\nwas two to three percent per week.     There was extensive evidence\nthat it was Folco's practice to use violence and threats of\n\nviolence to collect debts.    For example, Folco explained to Gary\n\nCedroni (a Folco associate) that one of his debt collectors, who\nhad \"just got out of the can\" and was \"half fucking nuts,\" would\n\n\"crack\" a debtor in order to \"scare him enough\" to secure payment.1\nIn a second conversation, Folco told Cedroni that one of his debt\n\ncollectors had \"cracked [a debtor] on the mouth\" on Folco's behalf\n\nand said \"'You better have the money by six o'clock or else.'\"   In\n\na third conversation, George Melillo (another Folco associate)\n\nindicated to Folco that the next time he encountered a certain\ndebtor, Melillo would \"smash him in the mouth . . . [k]nock him out\n\ncold.\"   Folco suggested that the debtor be warned that if payment\n\nwas not made within a week, he and his father would get \"a\nbeating.\"   The surveillance tapes contained several other accounts\n\nof Folco's extortionate techniques.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n        The conversations quoted in this opinion were obtained by\nmeans of electronic listening devices installed in Folco's home and\na wiretap on Folco's telephone. (The government also installed a\nhidden camera outside Folco's home.) The government transcribed\nthese conversations to assist the jury in understanding the\nsurveillance tapes.      Although it was the tapes, not the\ntranscripts, that were admitted into evidence, our review was\nlimited to the transcripts. At certain points in the transcripts\nPerrotta disputes the government's version of what was said, and we\nhave noted those disputes.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fC. The Transactions\n\n           On April 22, 1995, Folco agreed to loan Regine $25,000 at\n\nan interest rate of two percent per week.    Regine needed this money\n\nto pay off other loan sharks who were charging him even higher\n\nrates of interest.2   Folco told Regine that he would get the money\n\nfrom a third party, who turned out to be Perrotta, and Regine\n\nexpressed his understanding that Folco would \"charge me a point,\"\n\nthat is, one percent per week, on top of the interest the third\n\nparty (Perrotta) would be charging Folco.\n\n           On April 24, Folco told Cedroni that he had said to \"the\nold man\" (Perrotta was 52 years old in 1995) that he \"might\n\nneed . . . 50,000 more.\"   Folco reported that he had asked Perrotta\n\"who am I gonna go to if I need that kind of money?\", and \"the old\nman\" had responded: \"Me! Come to me. . . .    I'll give you anything\n\nyou want.\"      That same day, Perrotta telephoned Folco, and the\nfollowing conversation ensued:\n           Perrotta: Hey, I got you a putter for ya.\n           Folco: Yeah.\n           Perrotta: Do you want me to bring it over\n           tomorrow?\n\n           Folco: Yeah.\nThey agreed that Perrotta would deliver the \"putter\" at 8:30 the\n\nnext morning.    Also on April 24, Folco told Regine \"[o]ne guy is\ngonna give me 25 G's tomorrow morning.\"     Folco also indicated that\nhe could get Regine an additional $25,000 in the near future.\n\n\n     2\n         Regine also had a pre-existing debt to Folco of $80,000.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f          At    8:19   a.m.   on   April   25,   Folco    told   Regine   (by\n\ntelephone) \"that guy's coming at eight thirty . . . .            He's gonna\n\nbring me that -- package.\"         Perrotta arrived at Folco's home at\n8:33, without a golf putter.        Perrotta asked Folco, \"You want to\n\ncount it?\"     Folco replied, \"No, no, I'll let him [presumably\n\nRegine] count it . . . .      There is 25 there?\"3       Perrotta indicated\nthat there was.    Folco explained his understanding of the terms of\n\nthe loan: \"that'll be 250 [one percent of $25,000) I'll give you\n\nevery Tuesday.\"    Perrotta indicated his assent.\n\n          Three minutes after Perrotta departed, Regine arrived at\n\nFolco's residence.     He thanked Folco and explained that he would\n\n\"take it [the $25,000] to . . . Joe,\" another loan shark to whom\n\nRegine was indebted at an even higher rate of interest.               In an\napparent reference to the second $25,000 loan which Folco and\n\nRegine had discussed, Folco said: \"I talked to a guy, gonna get\n\nback to me.    Gave me the bullshit, Jesus, ahh . . . I want a point\nand a half [one and a half percent], he give me that shit.\"           Folco\n\ntold Regine that he had rejected this proposal, but that he\n\nexpected to hear from the \"guy\" before the end of the week.\n\n          Indeed, Perrotta phoned Folco two days later about a\n\nsecond \"putter\":\n\n          Perrotta: You didn't like that, you didn't\n          like that ah that putter I got yah, I got you\n          another one.\n\n     3\n      According to the government's transcript of the surveillance\ntape, Folco made a second reference to Regine, who drove a beige\nInfinity, in this conversation: \"You probably seen the car. Ah, a\nbeige Infin-Infinity.\" Perrotta disputes this interpretation of\nthe tape, hearing instead a reference to a beige couch.\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          Folco: Alright.\n\n          Perrotta: You know and then you you whichever\n          one you like ah you keep and ah the one you\n          don't like you can give it to me back so I can\n          give it to somebody else.\n\n          Folco: I'll be here.\nLater that day, Perrotta showed up at Folco's residence, again\n\nwithout a golf putter.    In what the jury could have found was a\n\nreference to the schedule for interest payments, Folco said to\n\nPerrotta \"[e]very Wednesday,\" and there was evidence that Folco and\n\nPerrotta in fact met on subsequent Wednesdays.     Folco also said\n\n\"I'll be like ten weeks, that's all,\" which the jury could have\n\nfound was a statement of the term of the loan.\n          The following day Regine came to Folco's home.     Folco\n\nreported that \"[t]he guy that brought me the money yesterday[]\" had\n\nsupplied \"[a]ll twenties.\"     The two men counted the money and\ndetermined that it indeed amounted to \"25 thousand.\"        Regine\n\npromised to pay Folco \"the other five [hundred] [two percent of\n\n$25,000] Tuesdays\" (earlier in the conversation he had reiterated\n\nhis existing obligation to give Folco \"five\" on Tuesday for the\n\noriginal $25,000).   In other words, Folco got his money on Tuesday\n\nand Perrotta got his on Wednesday.\n\n          Consistent with the evidence summarized above, a notebook\n\nfound in Folco's residence contained entries that the jury could\n\nhave found were a record of two loans of $25,000 each from Perrotta\n\nto Folco. FBI expert Jerome Simpson offered the opinion that these\n\nloans, at an interest rate of one percent per week -- \"below the\n\nrate of all of the other loans in this [notebook], and . . . below\n\n                                 -10-\n\fthe rate of any other loan that I've ever seen for a loan shark to\n\nmake, putting money out on the street\" -- were probably loans from\n\none loan shark to another.     As Folco explained his financial\narrangements to Regine, \"the guys I go see that lend money, I\n\nguarantee that money out.\"\n\n          This was not the first time Perrotta had advanced money\nto Folco, as evidenced by the following conversation between Folco\n\nand Eddie Lato, one of his \"business\" partners:\n\n          Lato: You know, what he [Perrotta] does\n          sometimes . . . you ask him for two [thousand]\n          he freezes. He's got something about . . . I\n          don't know if he thinks you're gonna try and\n          rob him. . . .\n\n          Folco: Today it wasn't that.     Last time I\n          asked him, \"Ya, anything you want?\" Took ten\n          off him, remember.\"4\n\nIn addition, Folco made reference in a recorded conversation to an\n\nearlier \"deal\" he had done (for \"a point\") with the source of the\n\n$50,000 he was lending to Regine.\n\nD. The Seizure of Perrotta's Cash and Weapons\n\n          A search conducted on June 23, 1995, turned up $4,703 in\ncash on Perrotta's person, $4,800 in cash around Perrotta's house,\ntwo handguns and ammunition in a nightstand in a first-floor\n\nbedroom, a third handgun, brass knuckles, a fake bomb in Perrotta's\ngarage, and a billy club in his car.   The next day, Folco had the\nfollowing conversation with Lato:\n\n\n\n     4\n        Perrotta's  version  of  this  exchange  denotes as\nunintelligible Folco's final five words (\"Took ten off him,\nremember.\")\n\n                               -11-\n\f           Lato: Um.    Perrotta, they got.       I'm afraid.\n\n           Folco: What they [unintelligible] on him?\n\n           Lato: Bombs, guns, everything.\n           Folco:     He     ain't      worried           about\n           [unintelligible].    If he blows up.             Hm.\n           [Unintelligible] he's dead.5\n\nLato then informed Folco that (presumably the police) \"[t]ook 10\noff of Perrotta,\" consistent with the seizure the day before of\n\n$9503 from Perrotta.    Lato reported that he had spoken to Perrotta\n\nafter the raid, and that either he or Perrotta had said to the\n\nother:   \"it's   over   for    us.\"6      Folco   expressed   concern   that\n\n\"[s]omebody will rat.\"        Lato agreed: \"And they gonna say that we,\n\nwe, we bankrolled the whole fucking thing.\"\n\nE. The Evidence of Perrotta's Knowledge of Folco's \"Business\"\n\n           First, there was evidence tending to show that Perrotta\n\nhad repeated dealings with Folco in relation to Folco's money-\nlending operation.      The jury could have inferred from Folco's\nreport to Cedroni that he had told \"the old man\" that he \"might\n\nneed . . . 50,000 more\" (emphasis added) that Perrotta was an\n\nongoing participant in Folco's loan sharking business.            The same\ninference is supported by Folco's reference to a previous \"deal\" he\n\n\n\n     5\n        Perrotta's version of this conversation denotes as\nunintelligible Folco's final remarks, transcribed by the government\nas \"If he blows up. Hm. [Unintelligible] he's dead.\"\n     6\n        The jury could have so interpreted the following statement\nby Lato to Folco: \"Took 10 off of Perrotta.     BREAK (2 seconds)\n[unintelligible] were, were all the time saying it's over for us.\nThey took a shot at us huh. I was with him last night. He call me\nup. He said uh, will you come by and take me for a ride?\"\n\n                                       -12-\n\fhad done with the source of the $50,000, and by the conversation in\n\nwhich Lato and Folco discussed what Perrotta \"sometimes\" does when\n\nasked for money. Based on this evidence, the jury could have\nconcluded that Perrotta was more than an unwitting, peripheral\n\nparticipant in Folco's loan sharking business.                      That inference\n\ncould have been reinforced for the jury by the concern Lato\nexpressed to Folco, after the search of Perrotta's home, that \"they\n\ngot\" Perrotta, \"I'm afraid\" (\"[b]ombs, guns, everything\"), and by\n\nthe statement by Lato or Perrotta that \"it's all over for us.\"\n\n           Second, if the jury found that Perrotta knew that Folco\n\nwas   re-lending   the    $50,000      to   a    third    person    --   as   Folco's\n\nstatement to Perrotta, \"I'll let him [presumably Regine] count it\n\n[the money Perrotta had just delivered],\" suggests -- it could also\nhave concluded that Perrotta must have realized that Folco and that\n\nperson   understood      that    violence       or   other   criminal    collection\n\ntechniques might be used.            This is because, for Folco to turn a\nprofit, he would have had to charge interest in excess of the one\n\npercent per week he was paying Perrotta, which would make the\n\nobligation legally unenforceable in Rhode Island.

The jury could have credited Simpson's\n\ntestimony that, in his opinion, the loan from Perrotta to Folco at\n\nthe relatively low rate of one percent per week \"was probably a\n\nloan from one loan shark to another,\" and that Folco's role in the\n\ntransactions   was,      as     he   explained       to   Regine,   to   \"guarantee\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f[Perrotta's] money out.\"         If the jury believed that Perrotta\n\nhimself was a loan shark, it could have reasoned that he must have\n\nrealized   that   Folco   was   one    too,   and   that   Folco   might   use\nextortionate methods to collect the $50,000 he had borrowed from\n\nPerrotta and loaned to Regine.\n\n           In sum, while there was no direct evidence that Perrotta\n\nunderstood the extortionate nature of Folco's transactions with\n\nRegine, there is enough circumstantial evidence to support a jury\n\nfinding that he must have realized how Folco would enforce, if\n\nnecessary, Regine's repayment obligations.\n\n                    III. Admission of the Weapons\n\n           Perrotta filed a pre-trial motion in limine \"to exclude,\nas evidence against him, all tangible evidence seized from his\nresidence as such evidence is inadmissible pursuant to Federal Rule\n\nof Evidence 404(b) and introduction of the same would deny the\ndefendant the fair trial to which he is entitled.\"            At the motion\nhearing, Perrotta argued that introduction of the guns, brass\n\nknuckles, billy club, and fake bomb would be \"highly prejudicial.\"\nThose items, he contended, are \"irrelevant to the crimes charged\nand will clearly result in the [j]ury being invited to convict Mr.\n\nPerrotta . . . because . . . of bad character or things that the\n[j]ury in this climate will not like -- possession of firearms\nand . . . other weapons.\"       The district court denied the motion.\n\n           At trial, police officers testified to the discovery of\nthe guns, brass knuckles, and fake bomb in Perrotta's residence,\n\nand the billy club in Perrotta's car.          Except with respect to the\n\n                                      -14-\n\fbrass knuckles, Perrotta made no objection to this testimony.   Nor\n\ndid he raise a 404(b) objection to the recorded conversation in\n\nwhich Lato said to Folco \"they got\" Perrotta, \"[b]ombs, guns,\neverything.\"7     However, when the government requested that the\n\nseized items be marked as exhibits, Perrotta objected on the ground\n\nof \"relevance.\"\n          On appeal, Perrotta argues that the district court should\n\nhave excluded the weapons under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) as evidence of\n\nother crimes, wrongs, or acts, or because their probative value was\n\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice under\n\nFed. R. Evid. 403.8\n\n          To admit evidence of [other] bad acts, a trial\n          court must find that the evidence passes two\n          tests. First, the evidence must have 'special\n          relevance' to an issue in the case . . . , and\n          must not include \"bad character or propensity\n          as a necessary link in the inferential chain.\"\n          Second, under Rule 403, evidence that is\n          specially relevant may still be excluded if\n          its    probative   value    is   substantially\n          outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\n\nUnited States v.

He does not pursue his hearsay argument on\nappeal.\n     8\n        On appeal, Perrotta does not renew his objection to the\ntestimony about the brass knuckles.\n\n                                -15-\n\fA. Rule 404(b)\n\n            Although Perrotta argues that the weapons had none of the\n\nspecial relevance to the charges against him required by Rule\n\n404(b), he did not challenge the police testimony that the weapons\n\nwere   found    in    his   possession.      Nor   did    he    challenge   Lato's\n\n\"[b]ombs, guns, everything\" remark on special relevance grounds.\n\nThus, even if we were to conclude that the introduction of the\n\nactual weapons lacked the special relevance required by the rule\n\nand only served to create a negative inference about Perrotta's\n\ncharacter, we would have to consider the important fact that\nevidence about Perrotta's possession of the weapons was already in\n\nthe case because of the testimony to which Perrotta did not object\non 404(b) grounds.          \"Under Fed. R. Evid. 103(a), this court must\nreview a challenged evidentiary decision to determine whether 'a\n\nsubstantial right of the party is affected.'\" Doty v. Sewall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545153\"><a href=\"/opinion/545153/arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall-arthur-doty-v-richard-sewall/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1053</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1057 (1st Cir. 1990) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)).                We\nhave held that \"no substantial right of the party is affected where\n\nthe    evidence      admitted   was   cumulative     as    to    other   admitted\nevidence.\"     Id. To the extent that Perrotta was concerned that the\n\nadmission of the weapons into evidence wrongly alerted the jury to\n\nthe fact that he had possessed them, any such error would be\nharmless.      The jury already knew that fact from the testimony of\nwitnesses about the weapons.\n\n            For the sake of completeness, however, and to dispel any\nnotion of unfairness surrounding the admission of the testimony\n\nabout the weapons, we add that if Perrotta had objected to the\n\n                                      -16-\n\ftestimony about the weapons, and had not limited his objection to\n\ntheir introduction into evidence, his objection would have been\n\nmeritless.      Testimony about the discovery of the guns, brass\nknuckles, billy club, and fake bomb in Perrotta's home and car had\n\nthe special relevance to the government's case required by Rule\n\n404(b).    In a conversation recorded the day after the search of\nPerrotta's home and car, Lato said to Folco that he was \"afraid\"\n\nthat \"[b]ombs, guns, everything\" had been taken from Perrotta. The\n\nFolco-Lato conversation in all of its detail was probative of the\n\nrelationship between Perrotta and Folco, revealing an alarmed\n\nreaction by Folco and Lato to the investigation of Perrotta, and\n\nthereby suggesting that Perrotta was a significant player in their\n\nloansharking operation.         In addition, their awareness of the\ndetails of the seizure from Perrotta so soon after it happened was\n\nfurther evidence of their close relationship with him.           Perrotta's\n\ncontention that the weapons had no relevance except to support a\nnegative inference about his character is therefore without merit.\n\n             The government also argues that the seized weapons were\n\nrelevant generally as \"tools of the trade\" of extortion because\n\nthey are useful to protect the lender and intimidate borrowers, and\n\nthus they tend to show that Perrotta was a loan shark.                We have\n\nsaid that \"in drug trafficking firearms have become 'tools of the\n\ntrade'    and   thus   are   probative    of   the   existence   of   a   drug\n\nconspiracy.\"     United States v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530305\"><a href=\"/opinion/530305/united-states-v-dalton-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).    The government urges us to extend the \"tools of the trade\"\n\nrationale for the admission of weapons to the crime of extortion,\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\freasoning that weapons are tools of the loan shark's trade just as\n\nthey are tools of the drug dealer's trade, and thus are probative\n\nof loan sharking activity. United States v. Gilley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499807\"><a href=\"/opinion/499807/united-states-v-robert-william-gilley-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1214 n.9 (9th Cir. 1988) (noting that the \"tools of the trade\"\n\ndoctrine might be applicable to extortion).      The district court\n\nappeared to endorse the government's \"tools of the trade\" theory in\ndenying Perrotta's motion to exclude the weapons.      In our view,\n\nhowever, there are three reasons why this was a poor case for the\n\ngovernment to urge extending the tools of the trade doctrine to the\n\ncrime of extortion: (1) the government does not claim that Perrotta\n\nhimself used threats of violence to enforce debts owed to him; (2)\n\nthere was little left of Perrotta's relevance objection after he\n\ndid not object to the testimony about the weapons; and (3) the\nweapons had a case-specific relevance to the charges against\n\nPerrotta that we have already described.     See Gilley, 836 F.2d at\n\n1214 n.9 (\"Where, as here, a clear nexus exists between the\nevidence and the crime charged, no resort need be made to the\n\n'tools of the trade' doctrine.\").     Because resort to the tools of\nthe trade doctrine was unnecessary in this case, we do not address\n\nthe merits of the government's argument.\n\nB. Rule 403\n\n          Perrotta also argues that the weapons should have been\nexcluded under Rule 403, as their probative value was substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.     Since the jury was\nnot being asked to make any specific determinations concerning the\n\nphysical characteristics of the weapons, we discern no particular\n\n                               -18-\n\freason why the jury needed to see the actual weapons.          However, it\n\nis a commonplace of trial practice that testimony about physical\n\nobjects often leads to their introduction into evidence.               That\nintroduction   serves   to     corroborate   the   testimony   about   the\n\nexistence of the objects, a purpose captured by the familiar phrase\n\n\"seeing is believing.\"9      This added increment of probative value is\nappropriate unless it is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice to the defendant.

By the same\n\ntoken, however, we see no unfair prejudice from the introduction of\n\nthe guns and the fake bomb into evidence.       The district court\ninstructed the jury that there was no evidence that Perrotta had\n\npossessed the guns illegally, and there was testimony that the bomb\n\nwas a fake.    Nothing in the record suggests that the guns or the\nfake bomb would have inflamed the jury or inspired them to decide\n\nthe case on an emotional basis.     See Varoudakis, 233 F.3d at 122\n\n(\"Usually, courts use the term 'unfair prejudice' for evidence that\n\ninvites the jury to render a verdict on an improper emotional\n\nbasis.\").\n\n            Similarly, although the brass knuckles and billy club\n\nwere surely unfamiliar items to the jurors,10 and were real rather\nthan fake, we again see nothing in the record to suggest that the\n\nbrass knuckles and billy club would have inflamed the jury to\n\ndecide the case on an emotional basis.       See id.    We therefore\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its broad discretion\n\nin admitting the weapons seized from Perrotta into evidence.\n\n                   IV. Suppression of the Weapons\n\n            Perrotta argues that the seizure of his weapons violated\n\nthe Fourth Amendment because the weapons were not described in the\nsearch warrant.     His argument ignores the plain view doctrine,\nwhich permits the seizure of items located in plain view if \"(1)\n\nthe seizing officer has a prior justification for being in a\n\n\n     10\n        The possession of brass knuckles and billy clubs is illegal\nin Rhode Island. The jurors, however, were not so advised.\n\n                                -20-\n\fposition to see the item in plain view and (2) the evidentiary\n\nvalue of the item is immediately apparent.\"       United States v.\n\nOwens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198347\"><a href=\"/opinion/198347/united-states-v-owens/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 746 (1st Cir. 1999).      Evidentiary value is\n\"immediately apparent\" if there are \"enough facts for a reasonable\n\nperson to believe that the items in plain view may be contraband or\n\nevidence of a crime.\"   United States v. Hamie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198286\"><a href=\"/opinion/198286/united-states-v-hamie/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 83 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n          Perrotta fails to explain why the plain view exception is\n\ninapplicable to this case. The search was conducted pursuant to an\n\ninvestigation of a loansharking conspiracy that used violence to\n\nenforce repayment obligations.    The officers had reason to believe\n\nthat the weapons could have evidentiary value in connection with\n\ntheir investigation, as Perrotta could have used the weapons to\ncollect debts or to protect his cash.   It makes no difference that\n\nthe weapons were not used to commit the crimes for which Perrotta\n\nwas convicted; the Fourth Amendment requires simply that the\ninvestigators, at the time of the seizure, had reasonable grounds\n\nto believe that the items \"may [have been] contraband or evidence\n\nof a crime.\"11   Id.\n\n                           V. Due Process\n\n          Perrotta argues that 18 U.S.C. § 893 violates the Due\nProcess Clause of the United States Constitution in proscribing the\nadvancement of money to a person \"with reasonable grounds to\n\n\n\n     11\n         The justification for the seizure of the billy club and\nbrass knuckes is even more straightforward: these items are illegal\nin Rhode Island.\n\n                                 -21-\n\fbelieve\" that the person intends to use the money to make an\n\nextortionate extension of credit.            Perrotta's position is that the\n\nquoted language \"invites confusion in the application of the\n'beyond a reasonable doubt' standard, and could easily lead the\n\njury to convict under this statute if the jury has 'reasonable\n\ngrounds' to believe the Defendant is guilty.\"\n              Perrotta cites no precedent that supports his view of\n\n§ 893, or of its implications for any of the other federal statutes\n\nthat include the same or similar language.               See, e.g., 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2388(c) (activities affecting armed forces during war) (punishing\n\n\"[w]hoever harbors or conceals any person who he knows, or has\n\nreasonable grounds to believe or suspect, has committed . . .                   an\n\noffense       under     this    section\")    (emphasis    added);     18   U.S.C.\n§ 1030(a)(1) (punishing, inter alia, whoever \"having knowingly\n\naccessed a computer without authorization . . . and by means of\n\nsuch conduct having obtained information that has been determined\nby the United States Government . . . to require protection against\n\nunauthorized disclosure, . . . with reason to believe that such\n\ninformation so obtained could be used to the injury of the United\n\nStates, . . . willfully communicates, delivers, transmits, or\n\ncauses to be communicated, delivered, or transmitted . . . the same\n\nto any person not entitled to receive it\") (emphasis added); 18\n\nU.S.C.    §    842(c)    (\"It   shall   be   unlawful    for   any   licensee   to\n\ndistribute explosive materials to any person who the licensee has\n\nreason to believe intends to transport such explosive materials\n\ninto a State where the purchase, possession, or use of explosive\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\fmaterials is prohibited. . . .\") (emphasis added).     Nor does he\n\nexplain why the government is wrong to suggest that \"Congress\n\nsurely has the power to adopt different standards of intent for the\nmens rea elements of federal crimes, so long as the jury must find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant acted with the given\n\nlevel of intent in committing the crime.\"    In the absence of any\nexplanation, his argument verges on the frivolous.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -23-\n\f</pre>",
