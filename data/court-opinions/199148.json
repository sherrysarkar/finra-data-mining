Wilson with whom Michael B. Levin, Wilson,\nSonsini, Goodrich & Rosati, Richard J. McCarthy and Edwards &\nAngell, LLP were on brief for appellant.\n     Thomas A. Mullen with whom Thomas A. Mullen, P.C. was on\nbrief for appellee.\n\f                             November 7, 2000\n\n\n\n\n             Per Curiam.     This case involves a dispute over the\n\nright to use the word \"clue\" in an Internet domain name.1                 Since\n\n1949, residents of the United States have enjoyed playing the\n\nClue® board game, a popular detective game in which players try\n\nto deduce the details of a fictional murder.                The name of this\n\ngame was registered with the United States Patent and Trademark\n\nOffice in 1950, and has been on the office's principal register\n\never since.      Hasbro, Inc., a toy and game manufacturer, owns the\n\nrights to the Clue® trademark and has spent millions of dollars\n\nin support of the Clue® brand name.\n\n             In June of 1994, decades after registration of the\n\nClue®   trademark,    Eric   Robison      and    Dieter    Muller   formed   in\n\nColorado     a    partnership     called        \"Clue     Computing,\"     later\n\nincorporated as \"Clue Computing, Inc.\"              Clue Computing engages\n\nin computer consulting and Internet access services.                Within two\n\nweeks   of   Clue   Computing's    formation,       the    Internet     Network\n\n\n\n    1For a brief description of the Internet and domain names,\nsee Sporty's Farm L.L.C. v. Sportsman's Market, Inc., 202 F.3d\n489, 492-93 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 2719 (2000), or\nHasbro, Inc. v. Clue Computing, Inc., 994 F. Supp. 34, 36-37 (D.\nMass. 1997).\n\n                                    -2-\n\fInformation Center, the agency that manages the assignment of\n\nInternet domain names, approved Clue Computing's registration of\n\nthe domain name \"clue.com.\"        Clue Computing now uses the domain\n\nname as the Internet address for its business web site.\n\n           In 1996, Hasbro notified Network Solutions, Inc., which\n\nadministers the Internet Network Information Center, that Hasbro\n\nowned a trademark on the word \"clue.\"              Network Solutions then\n\ninformed Clue Computing that its use of the \"clue.com\" domain\n\nname would soon be terminated.              Clue Computing responded by\n\nsuing Network Solutions in Colorado state court, and won a\n\npreliminary    injunction     against     the     threatened   termination.\n\nHasbro then sued Clue Computing in federal district court in\n\nMassachusetts, charging Clue Computing with infringement and\n\ndilution of the Clue® trademark, under the applicable provisions\n\nof the federal Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125 (1994 & Supp. I\n\n1995), and the Massachusetts anti-dilution act, Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 110B, § 12 (1998).\n\n           In an initial decision, the district court found that\n\nit had personal jurisdiction over Clue Computing.              Hasbro, Inc.\n\nv. Clue Computing, Inc., 994 F. Supp. 34, 44-46 (D. Mass. 1997).\n\nAfter the parties agreed to allow the district court to act as\n\nthe   finder   of   fact   with   respect    to   the   trademark   dilution\n\nclaims, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fClue Computing on Hasbro's trademark infringement claim, and\n\ndecided    the   merits    in     favor    of    Clue   Computing   on    Hasbro's\n\nfederal    and   state    dilution        claims.       Hasbro,   Inc.    v.   Clue\n\nComputing, Inc., 66 F. Supp. 2d 117, 119 (D. Mass. 1999).\n\n            In a nutshell, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment    in   favor    of    Clue     Computing      on   Hasbro's    trademark\n\ninfringement claim on the ground that there was no significant\n\nevidence to establish the likelihood of confusion necessary for\n\nconventional trademark infringement, see International Ass'n of\n\nMachinists & Aerospace Workers, AFL-CIO v. Winship Green Nursing\n\nCtr., 103 F.3d 196, 200-01 (1st Cir. 1996); Astra Pharm. Prods.,\n\nInc. v. Beckman Instruments, Inc., 718 F.2d 1201, 1207-08 (1st\n\nCir.   1983).     The     court    saw    very    little     similarity    between\n\nHasbro's products and services and those of Clue Computing.                      It\n\nsaid that about all that Hasbro showed was that over a period of\n\nyears a couple of Internet surfers looking for Hasbro's Clue®\n\nsite had stumbled upon the Clue Computing site, whose content\n\nstrongly indicated that the site had little to do with Hasbro's\n\nbusiness.    Certainly in a case involving such disparate products\n\nand services as this, the court's refusal to enter the \"initial\n\ninterest confusion\" thicket is well taken given the unlikelihood\n\nof \"legally significant\" confusion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f          As for Hasbro's claim under the Federal Trademark\n\nDilution Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(c), the court rejected Clue\n\nComputing's claim that granting an injunction under the statute\n\nwould be \"impermissibly retroactive\" (Clue Computing having\n\nbegun using the domain name before the new dilution statute took\n\neffect); but the court found on the merits that the Clue® mark\n\nwas not famous, that Clue Computing's use of the domain name did\n\nnot blur or tarnish Hasbro's mark, and that in any event the\n\nequities would not justify an injunction.      See generally I.P.\n\nLund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., 163 F.3d 27 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\nThe dilution claim under state law was rejected for lack of\n\nproof of any likelihood of confusion, tarnishing, or blurring.\n\n          On this appeal, Hasbro attacks the district court's\n\nreasoning and findings both as to the infringement claim and as\n\nto the dilution claim under both the federal and state statutes.\n\nWe think that the district court's thorough and careful analysis\n\njustified denial of relief.    Although Hasbro has written an able\n\nbrief, nothing in the discussion persuades us that the district\n\ncourt used incorrect legal standards, erred in determining that\n\nthere   were   no   material   issues   requiring   trial   on   the\n\ninfringement claim, or made clearly erroneous findings of fact\n\non the dilution claim.     Accordingly, we generally adopt the\n\ndistrict court's analysis without needlessly repeating it.\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f         There   are   two   qualifications   to   this   general\n\nendorsement.   The retroactivity issue that was treated at some\n\nlength by the district court is a question on which there is\n\ndisagreement among various courts, and, as it does not affect\n\nthe outcome, we prefer to take no position on the matter.   Also,\n\nas it does not affect the result, it is unnecessary to decide\n\nhere whether lack of equity would be an independent ground for\n\ndenial of an injunction if Hasbro showed that its mark was\n\nfamous and had been tarnished or blurred by Clue Computing.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -6-\n\f",

We think that the district court's thorough and careful analysis justified denial of relief. Although Hasbro has written an able brief, nothing in the discussion persuades us that the district court used incorrect legal standards, erred in determining that there were no material issues requiring trial on the infringement claim, or made clearly erroneous findings of fact on the dilution claim. Accordingly, we generally adopt the district court's analysis without needlessly repeating it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two qualifications to this general endorsement. The retroactivity issue that was treated at some length by the district court is a question on which there is disagreement among various courts, and, as it does not affect the outcome, we prefer to take no position on the matter. Also, as it does not affect the result, it is unnecessary to decide here whether lack of equity would be an independent ground for denial of an injunction if Hasbro showed that its mark was famous and had been tarnished or blurred by Clue Computing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> For a brief description of the Internet and domain names, see Sporty's Farm L.L.C. v.
