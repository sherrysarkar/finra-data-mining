José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                      Torruella, Chief Judge,\n\n                 Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rafael F. Castro-Lang, was on brief, for appellant.\n     Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant U.S. Attorney, with whom Guillermo\nGil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Assistant U.S.\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           April 5, 2001\n\f          TORRUELLA, Chief Judge. Appellant Manuel González-Soberal\n\nwas tried before a jury and convicted of conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute multiple kilograms of cocaine as well as\n\ndistribution of eight, nineteen, and twenty-nine kilograms of cocaine\n\non three occasions. The government's case against González rested\n\nentirely on the testimony of two cooperating witnesses, William Negrón\n\nZapata and Willy Maya Acosta.\n\n          González brings this appeal challenging the denial of a writ\n\nof habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255. His primary claim is\n\nthat his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by\n\nfailing to use two pieces of documentary evidence with which to impeach\n\nthe government's chief witnesses, Negrón and Maya.1 We vacate the\n\ndenial of the writ and remand for further consideration of this issue\n\nby the district court.\n\n                             Background\n\n          In October 1994, pursuant to a cooperation agreement, Negrón\n\nprovided evidence against five individuals in a trial for conspiracy to\n\ndistribute and distribution of cocaine. All five defendants were\n\nconvicted. Maya, one of the co-defendants, began cooperating with the\n\ngovernment around the time of his sentencing.       Maya provided the\n\n\n\n1 Appellant also argued, in the alternative, that the government failed\nto meet its obligation under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), in\nnot providing these documents to the defense, but this claim was\nconceded by appellant at oral argument.\n\n                                 -2-\n\fgovernment with González's name and identified him as the sixth\n\nindicted co-conspirator, who up to that point had been known only as\n\nJohn Doe, a.k.a. \"Raúl\".     This identification ultimately led to\n\nGonzález's arrest in January 1995.\n\n          The government's case against González rested wholly on the\n\ntestimony of cooperating witnesses Maya and Negrón. Both Maya and\n\nNegrón alleged that their introductions to and interactions with\n\nGonzález revolved around five cocaine transactions taking place in\n\nOctober of 1991. From the record, we summarize the substance of their\n\nrespective testimonies.\n\n          Maya testified to having met González for the first time on\n\nJuly 25, 1990. On that date, Maya claims to have been approached by a\n\nman and a woman while he was in the process of tying his boat up to the\n\npier in the Boquerón bay area. At the trial, Maya identified this man\n\nas González. Small talk was made, and the two men went for a ride in\n\nMaya's boat, at which point the man asked Maya whether he knew of any\n\nfisherman in the area who had found bales of cocaine or marijuana.\n\nMaya replied that he \"hadn't been that lucky.\" The man continued that\n\nhe would be interested in purchasing any bales that became available\n\nand that he would pay Maya a $1,000 commission for any such sales that\n\nMaya could arrange. After they returned to the pier, the man wrote\n\ndown his home and cellular phone numbers for Maya and asked him to call\n\nif he was able to provide any cocaine or marijuana.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          Maya was introduced to Negrón at a family gathering in March\n\n1991. The introduction ultimately resulted in arrangements being made\n\nto facilitate cocaine sales from Negrón to Maya.       The first two\n\ntransactions were an exchange of seven and eighteen kilograms of\n\ncocaine between Negrón and Maya at a price of $10,000 per kilo. The\n\nmoney for the cocaine was allegedly provided by González, with Maya\n\nacting as the go-between in exchange for his $1,000 commission per\n\nsale.\n\n          For the third transaction, Maya testified that González\n\narrived at Maya's house with his wife and daughter in a red Toyota\n\nstation wagon (or hatchback). Maya invited González to accompany him\n\nto meet Negrón. Maya allegedly told González not to reveal his real\n\nname, but to introduce himself as \"Raúl\".       The two met Negrón,\n\nexchanged the money for the cocaine, and returned to Maya's house,\n\nwhere González remained for approximately one hour before leaving.\n\n          González went with Maya to meet Negrón for both the fourth\n\nand fifth cocaine transactions. During the fifth exchange, Maya was\n\ncalled away to drive a family member to the airport. Maya instructed\n\nGonzález to wait for Negrón's call (at Maya's house), which he did.\n\nGonzález then went to meet Negrón to pick up the cocaine without Maya.\n\nFinally, Maya testified that he and his family had visited González at\n\nGonzález's home during 1992 and 1993.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          The trial transcript reveals that Negrón corroborated Maya's\n\nstory as to their introduction and as to the details of the five\n\nOctober cocaine transactions. Negrón testified that, at the third\n\nmeeting, Maya was accompanied by an individual whom Maya introduced to\n\nNegrón as \"Raúl\", one of his \"friends from San Juan.\" At trial, Negrón\n\nidentified González as the person Maya had introduced to him. Negrón\n\nstated that González (known to him as \"Raúl\") accompanied Maya for the\n\nfourth and fifth exchanges as well. When he returned with the drugs on\n\nthe fifth date, only \"Raúl\" and an unidentified woman were there to\n\nmeet him. \"Raúl\" allegedly explained Maya's absence by saying that he\n\nhad been called away on a family matter. Negrón also testified that\n\n\"Raúl\" had arrived at the transaction site in a burgundy Toyota station\n\nwagon.\n\n          González's trial counsel cross-examined both Maya and Negrón\n\nin several areas.    In cross-examining Maya, González's attorney\n\nquestioned him about his agreement to testify and the fact that his\n\nsentence might be reduced as a result of his cooperation. Maya also\n\nadmitted that he had heard Negrón's testimony prior to testifying\n\nhimself.2 During Negrón's cross-examination, González's trial counsel\n\nasked him about his prior criminal activities and about the benefits he\n\nwas receiving from the government in exchange for his testimony.\n\n2 It is unclear whether Maya heard Negrón's testimony at González's\ntrial or at Maya's trial. Since Maya was in custody at the time of\nGonzález's trial, it seems more likely that it was the latter.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            In addition, González's trial counsel elicited the\n\ninconsistency between Negrón's testimony that \"Raúl\" had accompanied\n\nMaya to the third cocaine transaction and his failure to mention\n\n\"Raúl\"'s presence at this sale in his 92-page statement written in\n\nconnection with his cooperation agreement. Negrón admitted that no\n\nencounters that he had with \"Raúl\" lasted longer than three minutes.\n\nFinally, Negrón had suggested to agents at one point in the\n\ninvestigation that the \"Raúl\" in question was a person named Raúl\n\nTiburón.3\n\n            As for González's case-in-chief, one of the government\n\nagents, Héctor Ortiz-Rodríguez, was called to testify. A man by the\n\nname of Raúl Tiburón was initially arrested, but released after Negrón\n\nfailed to identify him. Later, agents, seeking to arrest González,\n\nmistakenly arrested his brother.4 Ortiz was likely called to testify\n\nabout these two prior arrests in order to suggest that the government\n\nwas not sure that they had the right person.\n\n            González also took the stand in his own defense.       He\n\ntestified that he owned a brown Ford pickup, not a red or burgundy\n\n\n3 Negrón explained that during his detention on the drug charges, an\nattorney visited him and stated that he was there \"on behalf of Raúl\nTiburón and of Boliche [Maya's alias].\" Negrón supposedly concluded\nfrom this that the attorney was referring to the \"Raúl\" that had been\nwith Maya for the last three cocaine transactions.\n4 Apparently, part of the confusion resulted from the similarity\nbetween González's name (Manuel González-Soberal) and his brother's\n(Manuel Osvaldo González-Soberal).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fToyota station wagon. He stated that he lived in Hato Rey, not San\n\nJuan, and that he had never traveled to the Boquerón area of Puerto\n\nRico during 1990 or 1991. Under cross-examination, he stated that he\n\nhad never seen Negrón or Maya before and that he did not know them.\n\n            González was convicted based on Maya's and Negrón's testimony\n\non May 23, 1995 and subsequently sentenced to 188-month imprisonment.\n\nHis trial counsel then withdrew from the case, and a new attorney\n\nrepresented him in the direct appeal of his conviction, United States\n\nv. González-Soberal, 109 F.3d 868 (1st Cir. 1997) (affirming), and\n\nrepresents him in this § 2255 appeal.\n\n            González's appellate counsel purports to have discovered two\n\npieces of documentary evidence that could have been used to impeach\n\nNegrón and Maya. The first document is a letter written by Negrón5 to\n\nsomeone named Jorge.      The main thrust of the letter is aimed at\n\nassuring Jorge that, although Negrón is cooperating with the\n\ngovernment, he does not intend to implicate Jorge in any criminal\n\nactivity.    The letter (translated from Spanish) states, in part:\n\n            Jorge I have not yet been sentenced because the\n            federals interviewed me and I went and spoke to\n            them and told them with all the persons I had\n            dealt and they told me that if I cooperated with\n            them they could get me less years and I am\n            telling you but do not tell anyone what is\n            important is that nothing will happen to you you\n            are like a brother to me and I am not going to\n\n5 It has not been confirmed that this letter was actually written by\nNegrón, but we assume so for the purposes of this appeal.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f          tell anything that will harm you. Jorge please\n          don't tell anyone for I may be screwed. What I\n          am telling you do not tell anyone, keep it to\n          yourself please. Of those I dealt with the ones\n          that are going are: Perry, Papito, Elton, Pto.\n          Real, Tito Morgan, Cucho, Alejandro, Boliche, Ram\n          and Chamchi of the Parguera.\n\nThe letter, according to González, should have been used to show that\n\nNegrón, despite his agreement to be honest and to reveal everything\n\nthat he knew, had not been entirely truthful with the government\n\nagents. From this act of withholding information, the jury could infer\n\nthat Negrón might be willing to be dishonest in other regards. The\n\nletter, therefore, could have had a detrimental effect on Negrón's\n\ncredibility.\n\n          González also contests his trial counsel's failure to impeach\n\nMaya with a psychodiagnostic report that suggested that Maya had a\n\nbelow-normal capacity to distinguish truth from fiction. In 1994, a\n\npsychological evaluation was performed on Maya to determine whether a\n\ndiminished capacity defense was appropriate for his trial. The results\n\nof the evaluation found that Maya suffered from Attention Deficit\n\nDisorder with hyperactivity, the long-term effects of which included an\n\n\"[in]ability to perceive reality without distortion\"6 and a tendency to\n\n\"bend reality to avoid dealing with perceived or anticipated harshness\n\n\n\n\n6 When read in context, it appears that the statement should have said\nan \"inability\" or an \"impaired ability\" to perceive reality without\ndistortion rather than an \"ability\".\n\n                                 -8-\n\fin the environment.\" This psychodiagnostic report might have caused\n\nthe jury to doubt the reliability of Maya's testimony.\n\n          The district court rejected González's claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. In its Opinion and Order, the district court\n\nproperly set out the two-part test identified in Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1983), used for determining ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claims. In a troubling statement, however, the\n\ncourt went on to identify a standard for determining whether a\n\ndefendant has been prejudiced by his counsel's acts or omissions: \"In\n\norder to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Petitioner must\n\ndemonstrate that but for the unprofessional error, he would not have\n\nbeen found guilty.\" United States v. González-Soberal, Civ. No. 98-\n\n1292 (JAF), at 4 (Feb. 8, 1999). This suggests a higher standard than\n\nthe one set out in Strickland, i.e., an outcome-determinative standard\n\nthat requires a defendant to show that it is more likely than not that\n\ncounsel's errors assured a guilty verdict. This higher standard was\n\nconsidered, and explicitly rejected, by the Court in Strickland: \"The\n\nresult of a proceeding can be rendered unreliable, and hence the\n\nproceeding itself unfair, even if the errors of counsel cannot be shown\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence to have determined the outcome.\"\n\n466 U.S. at 694.\n\n          In the next paragraph of the Opinion and Order, the district\n\ncourt reverted to the appropriate Strickland test, that of reasonable\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fprobability, in stating that the failure to use the letter and\n\npsychodiagnostic reports for impeachment purposes was not prejudicial\n\nto González. This citation to the proper standard (and the other\n\ncorrect references found in the opinion) would do much to assuage this\n\nCourt that the district court did not apply an incorrectly high\n\nstandard, had the district court opinion provided an explanation for\n\nthe finding of no prejudice. Unfortunately, no reasons were provided\n\nto justify the district court's conclusion. The district court did not\n\npoint to the possible limited value of the impeachment testimony, to\n\nthe effectiveness of the cross-examination of the two government\n\nwitnesses otherwise, to the strength of the available evidence against\n\nthe defendant, or to any other factor or factors that may have been\n\nobserved and noted by the district court.\n\n                              Analysis\n\n          Ineffectiveness \"is a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 698. The district court findings of fact are\n\nsubject to the clearly erroneous standard. Id. In the past, we have\n\nreserved the question as to the precise standard of review to be used\n\nby this Court in evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims.7\n\n\n\n7 In another case, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel based on\na conflict of interest, we held that the de novo standard of review\napplied, while according the deference of the clearly erroneous\nstandard to the district court's underlying findings of fact. Familia-\nConsoro v. United States, 160 F.3d 761, 764-65 (1st Cir. 1998) (actual,\nrather than constructive, conflict of interest).\n\n                                 -10-\n\fBucuvalas v. United States, 98 F.3d 652, 657 n.1 (1st Cir. 1996);\n\nUnited States v. McGill, 11 F.3d 223, 226 n.2 (1st Cir. 1993). We need\n\nnot decide the issue at this time, because, irrespective of whatever\n\nstandard we may employ, the actions taken by the district court compel\n\nour conclusion.\n\n          In order for a defendant to succeed in an ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim, he must show, by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, that defendant's trial counsel's conduct fell below the\n\nstandard of reasonably effective assistance and that counsel's errors\n\nprejudiced the defense. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. The district\n\ncourt did not evaluate González's trial counsel's efforts, but instead\n\nproceeded directly to the prejudice requirement, rejecting the claim on\n\nthat basis.   Addressing the prejudice prong prior to evaluating\n\ncounsel's conduct is a permissible approach and even endorsed where\n\nmore efficient. Id. at 697. We will follow the district court's order\n\nin our review of González's ineffectiveness claim and turn now to\n\nwhether the alleged errors of González's counsel resulted in prejudice.\n\n          As stated previously, prejudice exists in a particular case\n\nwhen there is \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. 694. A reasonable probability is one\n\n\"sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id. On one end,\n\nit is not enough to show that the errors had \"some conceivable effect\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fon the outcome.\" Id. at 693. Nor is it required, however, that the\n\ndefendant prove that the errors were more likely than not to have\n\naffected the verdict. Id. It is important to maintain the focus of an\n\nineffectiveness inquiry on the \"fundamental fairness of the\n\nproceeding.\"   Id. at 696.\n\n          Three factors need to be considered in this case in order to\n\nmake the prejudice determination. The first is the strength of the\n\ngovernment's case against González. Second, we must evaluate the\n\neffectiveness of the presentation of González's defense absent the\n\nimpeachment documents.     Third, we must consider the potential\n\nimpeachment value of the two documents in undermining the credibility\n\nof the government witnesses' testimony.\n\n          Examining the government's case, we note that a significant\n\nfactor weighing in favor of finding prejudice is the absence of any\n\ncorroborating evidence other than the testimony of Maya and Negrón.\n\nSee Phoenix v. Matesanz, 189 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 1999) (case resting\n\nentirely on blood and fingerprint evidence). The government had no\n\nsurveillance, undercover agents, or hard evidence, such as phone\n\nrecords, with which to prove that González participated in the five\n\nreported drug transactions. \"In making this determination [prejudice],\n\na court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of\n\nthe evidence before the judge or jury. . . . Moreover, a verdict or\n\nconclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fbeen affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 695-96.\n\n          In addition, there were several weaknesses to Negrón and\n\nMaya's stories that were highlighted by González's counsel's cross-\n\nexamination. The fact that Negrón identified the man accompanied by\n\nMaya as \"Raúl\" or \"Raúl Tiburón\" until late in the investigation\n\nweakens his later identification of González as Maya's companion for\n\nthe last three drug transactions. Negrón's contact with González\n\nlasted only a few moments each time, and all the meetings occurred more\n\nthan three years before Negrón testified in this case.        There is\n\ncertainly an argument that Negrón was mistaken in his identification,\n\nor even implicated González in an effort to cover the tracks of others\n\nor to ingratiate himself to the government agents.\n\n          Maya's testimony had flaws as well. His story of the chance\n\nmeeting of González, González's proposition that they engage in drug\n\ntransactions, and González's alleged entrustment of large sums of money\n\nto Maya seems rather implausible. And under cross-examination, Maya\n\nalso admitted his self-interest in cooperating with the government in\n\nGonzález's case and to having heard Negrón's testimony prior to\n\nproviding his own version of events.\n\n          On the other hand, there was significant evidence presented\n\nat trial indicating that González was involved in these drug deals.\n\nFrom the outset of Maya's cooperation, he identified \"Raúl\" as\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fGonzález, correctly providing agents with González's full name and\n\naddress.   Maya and Negrón both pointed to González during their\n\ntestimony when asked whether \"Raúl\" was present.          And the two\n\nwitnesses, while telling different stories, corroborated one another's\n\naccounts with respect to González's alleged participation.\n\n           Turning to the impeachment value of the two documents,\n\nNegrón's letter suggests that he was not completely truthful in his\n\ncooperation with the government, which was directly contrary to what he\n\nhad agreed. The terms of his agreement with the government required\n\nthat he \"cooperate completely, candidly, and truthfully\" and provide\n\n\"any and all information in his possession relating directly or\n\nindirectly to any and all criminal activity concerning the importation,\n\npossession, and distribution of controlled substances in Puerto Rico or\n\nany other places and any related matters of which he has knowledge.\"8\n\nImpeachment of Negrón with the letter could have created a suspicion in\n\nthe jury's mind that Negrón was not being honest in his testimony. The\n\njury might not have concluded from this, however, that Negrón would\n\nfalsely implicate González. There is a definite distinction between\n\nNegrón withholding information to protect a friend and his lying under\n\noath as to González's involvement.\n\n\n\n8 While it may be that Negrón did not sign his official statement\n(April 26, 1994) until after he wrote the letter to Jorge (March of\n1993), it is clear that he had agreed to cooperate with the government\nas of August or October of 1992.\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          It is even more difficult to know the proper weight to place\n\non the statements made in Maya's psychodiagnostic report.          The\n\ndifficulties that Maya allegedly has in distorting reality are not\n\nsufficiently explained in terms that a layperson can definitively\n\nunderstand.    They may completely undermine Maya's testimony and\n\nidentification of González, and they may not. A clinical explanation\n\nof these comments would have been helpful to the jury at trial (if the\n\nreport had been used). This Court similarly lacks the background\n\nnecessary to predict what effect, if any, Maya's disabilities could\n\nhave on his testimony. Thus, we have little basis for estimating how\n\nthe jury would have perceived this report with appropriate medical\n\nexplanation.\n\n          Whether prejudice resulted from González's counsel's failure\n\nto impeach government witnesses Negrón and Maya with these two\n\ndocuments is a close call. That, coupled with the possibility that the\n\ndistrict court held González to an improperly stringent standard,\n\ndemands that we vacate the denial of González's § 2255 petition as to\n\nhis ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n\n          We could make an independent determination of prejudice based\n\non our review of the record and of the impeaching documents, but\n\nseveral factors caution us against this. First, the district court\n\npresided over the trial and has a better perspective from which to\n\nevaluate the possible impact of these two documents on the jury and its\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fverdict. Especially in a case such as this, where the strength of the\n\ngovernment's case rests largely on the credibility of the cooperating\n\nwitnesses, the trial judge has had a unique opportunity to form a\n\njudgment about the value of their testimony. Second, the impact of the\n\npsychodiagnostic report would be more accurately assessed with the\n\nbenefit of clinical explanation. The district court, in holding a\n\nprejudice hearing, could hear testimony explaining the possible impact\n\nof Maya's diagnosis on his ability to testify truthfully.\n\n          As such, we remand the case to the district court for a\n\nreevaluation of the possible prejudicial effect of González's counsel's\n\nalleged errors. If the district court still finds that prejudice is\n\nabsent, we would urge the district court to explain its conclusion\n\ngiven the closeness of the question as we have identified it. The\n\ndistrict court should consider whether to hold a hearing to determine\n\nwhether González's trial counsel's conduct met the standards\n\narticulated in Strickland for      reasonably effective assistance.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f",

This identification ultimately led to\n\nGonzález's arrest in January 1995.\n\n          The government's case against González rested wholly on the\n\ntestimony of cooperating witnesses Maya and Negrón. Both Maya and\n\nNegrón alleged that their introductions to and interactions with\n\nGonzález revolved around five cocaine transactions taking place in\n\nOctober of 1991. From the record, we summarize the substance of their\n\nrespective testimonies.\n\n          Maya testified to having met González for the first time on\n\nJuly 25, 1990. On that date, Maya claims to have been approached by a\n\nman and a woman while he was in the process of tying his boat up to the\n\npier in the Boquerón bay area. At the trial, Maya identified this man\n\nas González. Small talk was made, and the two men went for a ride in\n\nMaya's boat, at which point the man asked Maya whether he knew of any\n\nfisherman in the area who had found bales of cocaine or marijuana.\n\nMaya replied that he \"hadn't been that lucky.\" The man continued that\n\nhe would be interested in purchasing any bales that became available\n\nand that he would pay Maya a $1,000 commission for any such sales that\n\nMaya could arrange. After they returned to the pier, the man wrote\n\ndown his home and cellular phone numbers for Maya and asked him to call\n\nif he was able to provide any cocaine or marijuana.\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          Maya was introduced to Negrón at a family gathering in March\n\n1991. The introduction ultimately resulted in arrangements being made\n\nto facilitate cocaine sales from Negrón to Maya.       The first two\n\ntransactions were an exchange of seven and eighteen kilograms of\n\ncocaine between Negrón and Maya at a price of $10,000 per kilo. The\n\nmoney for the cocaine was allegedly provided by González, with Maya\n\nacting as the go-between in exchange for his $1,000 commission per\n\nsale.\n\n          For the third transaction, Maya testified that González\n\narrived at Maya's house with his wife and daughter in a red Toyota\n\nstation wagon (or hatchback). Maya invited González to accompany him\n\nto meet Negrón. Maya allegedly told González not to reveal his real\n\nname, but to introduce himself as \"Raúl\".       The two met Negrón,\n\nexchanged the money for the cocaine, and returned to Maya's house,\n\nwhere González remained for approximately one hour before leaving.\n\n          González went with Maya to meet Negrón for both the fourth\n\nand fifth cocaine transactions. During the fifth exchange, Maya was\n\ncalled away to drive a family member to the airport. Maya instructed\n\nGonzález to wait for Negrón's call (at Maya's house), which he did.\n\nGonzález then went to meet Negrón to pick up the cocaine without Maya.\n\nFinally, Maya testified that he and his family had visited González at\n\nGonzález's home during 1992 and 1993.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          The trial transcript reveals that Negrón corroborated Maya's\n\nstory as to their introduction and as to the details of the five\n\nOctober cocaine transactions. Negrón testified that, at the third\n\nmeeting, Maya was accompanied by an individual whom Maya introduced to\n\nNegrón as \"Raúl\", one of his \"friends from San Juan.\" At trial, Negrón\n\nidentified González as the person Maya had introduced to him. Negrón\n\nstated that González (known to him as \"Raúl\") accompanied Maya for the\n\nfourth and fifth exchanges as well. When he returned with the drugs on\n\nthe fifth date, only \"Raúl\" and an unidentified woman were there to\n\nmeet him. \"Raúl\" allegedly explained Maya's absence by saying that he\n\nhad been called away on a family matter. Negrón also testified that\n\n\"Raúl\" had arrived at the transaction site in a burgundy Toyota station\n\nwagon.\n\n          González's trial counsel cross-examined both Maya and Negrón\n\nin several areas.    In cross-examining Maya, González's attorney\n\nquestioned him about his agreement to testify and the fact that his\n\nsentence might be reduced as a result of his cooperation. Maya also\n\nadmitted that he had heard Negrón's testimony prior to testifying\n\nhimself.2 During Negrón's cross-examination, González's trial counsel\n\nasked him about his prior criminal activities and about the benefits he\n\nwas receiving from the government in exchange for his testimony.\n\n2 It is unclear whether Maya heard Negrón's testimony at González's\ntrial or at Maya's trial. Since Maya was in custody at the time of\nGonzález's trial, it seems more likely that it was the latter.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            In addition, González's trial counsel elicited the\n\ninconsistency between Negrón's testimony that \"Raúl\" had accompanied\n\nMaya to the third cocaine transaction and his failure to mention\n\n\"Raúl\"'s presence at this sale in his 92-page statement written in\n\nconnection with his cooperation agreement. Negrón admitted that no\n\nencounters that he had with \"Raúl\" lasted longer than three minutes.\n\nFinally, Negrón had suggested to agents at one point in the\n\ninvestigation that the \"Raúl\" in question was a person named Raúl\n\nTiburón.3\n\n            As for González's case-in-chief, one of the government\n\nagents, Héctor Ortiz-Rodríguez, was called to testify. A man by the\n\nname of Raúl Tiburón was initially arrested, but released after Negrón\n\nfailed to identify him. Later, agents, seeking to arrest González,\n\nmistakenly arrested his brother.4 Ortiz was likely called to testify\n\nabout these two prior arrests in order to suggest that the government\n\nwas not sure that they had the right person.\n\n            González also took the stand in his own defense.       He\n\ntestified that he owned a brown Ford pickup, not a red or burgundy\n\n\n3 Negrón explained that during his detention on the drug charges, an\nattorney visited him and stated that he was there \"on behalf of Raúl\nTiburón and of Boliche [Maya's alias].\" Negrón supposedly concluded\nfrom this that the attorney was referring to the \"Raúl\" that had been\nwith Maya for the last three cocaine transactions.\n4 Apparently, part of the confusion resulted from the similarity\nbetween González's name (Manuel González-Soberal) and his brother's\n(Manuel Osvaldo González-Soberal).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fToyota station wagon. He stated that he lived in Hato Rey, not San\n\nJuan, and that he had never traveled to the Boquerón area of Puerto\n\nRico during 1990 or 1991. Under cross-examination, he stated that he\n\nhad never seen Negrón or Maya before and that he did not know them.\n\n            González was convicted based on Maya's and Negrón's testimony\n\non May 23, 1995 and subsequently sentenced to 188-month imprisonment.\n\nHis trial counsel then withdrew from the case, and a new attorney\n\nrepresented him in the direct appeal of his conviction, United States\n\nv. González-Soberal, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1997) (affirming), and\n\nrepresents him in this § 2255 appeal.\n\n            González's appellate counsel purports to have discovered two\n\npieces of documentary evidence that could have been used to impeach\n\nNegrón and Maya. The first document is a letter written by Negrón5 to\n\nsomeone named Jorge.      The main thrust of the letter is aimed at\n\nassuring Jorge that, although Negrón is cooperating with the\n\ngovernment, he does not intend to implicate Jorge in any criminal\n\nactivity.    The letter (translated from Spanish) states, in part:\n\n            Jorge I have not yet been sentenced because the\n            federals interviewed me and I went and spoke to\n            them and told them with all the persons I had\n            dealt and they told me that if I cooperated with\n            them they could get me less years and I am\n            telling you but do not tell anyone what is\n            important is that nothing will happen to you you\n            are like a brother to me and I am not going to\n\n5 It has not been confirmed that this letter was actually written by\nNegrón, but we assume so for the purposes of this appeal.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f          tell anything that will harm you. Jorge please\n          don't tell anyone for I may be screwed. What I\n          am telling you do not tell anyone, keep it to\n          yourself please. Of those I dealt with the ones\n          that are going are: Perry, Papito, Elton, Pto.\n          Real, Tito Morgan, Cucho, Alejandro, Boliche, Ram\n          and Chamchi of the Parguera.\n\nThe letter, according to González, should have been used to show that\n\nNegrón, despite his agreement to be honest and to reveal everything\n\nthat he knew, had not been entirely truthful with the government\n\nagents. From this act of withholding information, the jury could infer\n\nthat Negrón might be willing to be dishonest in other regards. The\n\nletter, therefore, could have had a detrimental effect on Negrón's\n\ncredibility.\n\n          González also contests his trial counsel's failure to impeach\n\nMaya with a psychodiagnostic report that suggested that Maya had a\n\nbelow-normal capacity to distinguish truth from fiction. In 1994, a\n\npsychological evaluation was performed on Maya to determine whether a\n\ndiminished capacity defense was appropriate for his trial. The results\n\nof the evaluation found that Maya suffered from Attention Deficit\n\nDisorder with hyperactivity, the long-term effects of which included an\n\n\"[in]ability to perceive reality without distortion\"6 and a tendency to\n\n\"bend reality to avoid dealing with perceived or anticipated harshness\n\n\n\n\n6 When read in context, it appears that the statement should have said\nan \"inability\" or an \"impaired ability\" to perceive reality without\ndistortion rather than an \"ability\".\n\n                                 -8-\n\fin the environment.\" This psychodiagnostic report might have caused\n\nthe jury to doubt the reliability of Maya's testimony.\n\n          The district court rejected González's claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel. In its Opinion and Order, the district court\n\nproperly set out the two-part test identified in Strickland v.\n\nWashington, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), used for determining ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claims. In a troubling statement, however, the\n\ncourt went on to identify a standard for determining whether a\n\ndefendant has been prejudiced by his counsel's acts or omissions: \"In\n\norder to establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Petitioner must\n\ndemonstrate that but for the unprofessional error, he would not have\n\nbeen found guilty.\" United States v. González-Soberal, Civ. No. 98-\n\n1292 (JAF), at 4 (Feb. 8, 1999). This suggests a higher standard than\n\nthe one set out in Strickland, i.e., an outcome-determinative standard\n\nthat requires a defendant to show that it is more likely than not that\n\ncounsel's errors assured a guilty verdict. This higher standard was\n\nconsidered, and explicitly rejected, by the Court in Strickland: \"The\n\nresult of a proceeding can be rendered unreliable, and hence the\n\nproceeding itself unfair, even if the errors of counsel cannot be shown\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence to have determined the outcome.\"\n\n466 U.S. at 694.\n\n          In the next paragraph of the Opinion and Order, the district\n\ncourt reverted to the appropriate Strickland test, that of reasonable\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fprobability, in stating that the failure to use the letter and\n\npsychodiagnostic reports for impeachment purposes was not prejudicial\n\nto González. This citation to the proper standard (and the other\n\ncorrect references found in the opinion) would do much to assuage this\n\nCourt that the district court did not apply an incorrectly high\n\nstandard, had the district court opinion provided an explanation for\n\nthe finding of no prejudice. Unfortunately, no reasons were provided\n\nto justify the district court's conclusion. The district court did not\n\npoint to the possible limited value of the impeachment testimony, to\n\nthe effectiveness of the cross-examination of the two government\n\nwitnesses otherwise, to the strength of the available evidence against\n\nthe defendant, or to any other factor or factors that may have been\n\nobserved and noted by the district court.\n\n                              Analysis\n\n          Ineffectiveness \"is a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 698. The district court findings of fact are\n\nsubject to the clearly erroneous standard. Id. In the past, we have\n\nreserved the question as to the precise standard of review to be used\n\nby this Court in evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims.7\n\n\n\n7 In another case, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel based on\na conflict of interest, we held that the de novo standard of review\napplied, while according the deference of the clearly erroneous\nstandard to the district court's underlying findings of fact.

We need\n\nnot decide the issue at this time, because, irrespective of whatever\n\nstandard we may employ, the actions taken by the district court compel\n\nour conclusion.\n\n          In order for a defendant to succeed in an ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel claim, he must show, by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence, that defendant's trial counsel's conduct fell below the\n\nstandard of reasonably effective assistance and that counsel's errors\n\nprejudiced the defense. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. The district\n\ncourt did not evaluate González's trial counsel's efforts, but instead\n\nproceeded directly to the prejudice requirement, rejecting the claim on\n\nthat basis.   Addressing the prejudice prong prior to evaluating\n\ncounsel's conduct is a permissible approach and even endorsed where\n\nmore efficient. Id. at 697. We will follow the district court's order\n\nin our review of González's ineffectiveness claim and turn now to\n\nwhether the alleged errors of González's counsel resulted in prejudice.\n\n          As stated previously, prejudice exists in a particular case\n\nwhen there is \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\n\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\ndifferent.\" Strickland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. A reasonable probability is one\n\n\"sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Id. On one end,\n\nit is not enough to show that the errors had \"some conceivable effect\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fon the outcome.\" Id. at 693. Nor is it required, however, that the\n\ndefendant prove that the errors were more likely than not to have\n\naffected the verdict. Id. It is important to maintain the focus of an\n\nineffectiveness inquiry on the \"fundamental fairness of the\n\nproceeding.\"   Id. at 696.\n\n          Three factors need to be considered in this case in order to\n\nmake the prejudice determination. The first is the strength of the\n\ngovernment's case against González. Second, we must evaluate the\n\neffectiveness of the presentation of González's defense absent the\n\nimpeachment documents.     Third, we must consider the potential\n\nimpeachment value of the two documents in undermining the credibility\n\nof the government witnesses' testimony.\n\n          Examining the government's case, we note that a significant\n\nfactor weighing in favor of finding prejudice is the absence of any\n\ncorroborating evidence other than the testimony of Maya and Negrón.\n\nSee Phoenix v. Matesanz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198596\"><a href=\"/opinion/198596/phoenix-v-matesanz/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (1st Cir. 1999) (case resting\n\nentirely on blood and fingerprint evidence). The government had no\n\nsurveillance, undercover agents, or hard evidence, such as phone\n\nrecords, with which to prove that González participated in the five\n\nreported drug transactions. \"In making this determination [prejudice],\n\na court hearing an ineffectiveness claim must consider the totality of\n\nthe evidence before the judge or jury. . . . Moreover, a verdict or\n\nconclusion only weakly supported by the record is more likely to have\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fbeen affected by errors than one with overwhelming record support.\"\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 695-96.\n\n          In addition, there were several weaknesses to Negrón and\n\nMaya's stories that were highlighted by González's counsel's cross-\n\nexamination. The fact that Negrón identified the man accompanied by\n\nMaya as \"Raúl\" or \"Raúl Tiburón\" until late in the investigation\n\nweakens his later identification of González as Maya's companion for\n\nthe last three drug transactions. Negrón's contact with González\n\nlasted only a few moments each time, and all the meetings occurred more\n\nthan three years before Negrón testified in this case.        There is\n\ncertainly an argument that Negrón was mistaken in his identification,\n\nor even implicated González in an effort to cover the tracks of others\n\nor to ingratiate himself to the government agents.\n\n          Maya's testimony had flaws as well. His story of the chance\n\nmeeting of González, González's proposition that they engage in drug\n\ntransactions, and González's alleged entrustment of large sums of money\n\nto Maya seems rather implausible. And under cross-examination, Maya\n\nalso admitted his self-interest in cooperating with the government in\n\nGonzález's case and to having heard Negrón's testimony prior to\n\nproviding his own version of events.\n\n          On the other hand, there was significant evidence presented\n\nat trial indicating that González was involved in these drug deals.\n\nFrom the outset of Maya's cooperation, he identified \"Raúl\" as\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fGonzález, correctly providing agents with González's full name and\n\naddress.   Maya and Negrón both pointed to González during their\n\ntestimony when asked whether \"Raúl\" was present.          And the two\n\nwitnesses, while telling different stories, corroborated one another's\n\naccounts with respect to González's alleged participation.\n\n           Turning to the impeachment value of the two documents,\n\nNegrón's letter suggests that he was not completely truthful in his\n\ncooperation with the government, which was directly contrary to what he\n\nhad agreed. The terms of his agreement with the government required\n\nthat he \"cooperate completely, candidly, and truthfully\" and provide\n\n\"any and all information in his possession relating directly or\n\nindirectly to any and all criminal activity concerning the importation,\n\npossession, and distribution of controlled substances in Puerto Rico or\n\nany other places and any related matters of which he has knowledge.\"8\n\nImpeachment of Negrón with the letter could have created a suspicion in\n\nthe jury's mind that Negrón was not being honest in his testimony. The\n\njury might not have concluded from this, however, that Negrón would\n\nfalsely implicate González. There is a definite distinction between\n\nNegrón withholding information to protect a friend and his lying under\n\noath as to González's involvement.\n\n\n\n8 While it may be that Negrón did not sign his official statement\n(April 26, 1994) until after he wrote the letter to Jorge (March of\n1993), it is clear that he had agreed to cooperate with the government\nas of August or October of 1992.\n\n                                 -14-\n\f          It is even more difficult to know the proper weight to place\n\non the statements made in Maya's psychodiagnostic report.          The\n\ndifficulties that Maya allegedly has in distorting reality are not\n\nsufficiently explained in terms that a layperson can definitively\n\nunderstand.    They may completely undermine Maya's testimony and\n\nidentification of González, and they may not. A clinical explanation\n\nof these comments would have been helpful to the jury at trial (if the\n\nreport had been used). This Court similarly lacks the background\n\nnecessary to predict what effect, if any, Maya's disabilities could\n\nhave on his testimony. Thus, we have little basis for estimating how\n\nthe jury would have perceived this report with appropriate medical\n\nexplanation.\n\n          Whether prejudice resulted from González's counsel's failure\n\nto impeach government witnesses Negrón and Maya with these two\n\ndocuments is a close call. That, coupled with the possibility that the\n\ndistrict court held González to an improperly stringent standard,\n\ndemands that we vacate the denial of González's § 2255 petition as to\n\nhis ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n\n          We could make an independent determination of prejudice based\n\non our review of the record and of the impeaching documents, but\n\nseveral factors caution us against this. First, the district court\n\npresided over the trial and has a better perspective from which to\n\nevaluate the possible impact of these two documents on the jury and its\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fverdict. Especially in a case such as this, where the strength of the\n\ngovernment's case rests largely on the credibility of the cooperating\n\nwitnesses, the trial judge has had a unique opportunity to form a\n\njudgment about the value of their testimony. Second, the impact of the\n\npsychodiagnostic report would be more accurately assessed with the\n\nbenefit of clinical explanation. The district court, in holding a\n\nprejudice hearing, could hear testimony explaining the possible impact\n\nof Maya's diagnosis on his ability to testify truthfully.\n\n          As such, we remand the case to the district court for a\n\nreevaluation of the possible prejudicial effect of González's counsel's\n\nalleged errors. If the district court still finds that prejudice is\n\nabsent, we would urge the district court to explain its conclusion\n\ngiven the closeness of the question as we have identified it. The\n\ndistrict court should consider whether to hold a hearing to determine\n\nwhether González's trial counsel's conduct met the standards\n\narticulated in Strickland for      reasonably effective assistance.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f</pre>",
