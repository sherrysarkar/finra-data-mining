LaRoche for petitioner.\n\n     Janice K. O'Grady, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nUnited States Department of Justice, with whom Stuart E. Schiffer,\nActing Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and Christopher C.\nFuller, Senior Litigation Counsel, were on brief for respondent.\n\f                      ____________________\n\n                        December 19, 2001\n                      ____________________\n\n\n         LYNCH, Circuit Judge.       Cesar Nascimento, a citizen of\n\nCape Verde, was served in 1994 with an Order to Show Cause\n\ncharging that he had overstayed his non-immigrant visa.        After\n\na deportation hearing in 1995, an immigration judge granted him\n\nvoluntary departure, but he failed to depart by the specified\n\ndate. In 1996, he filed a motion to reopen proceedings, seeking\n\nsuspension of deportation or, in the alternative, a new order\n\nfor voluntary departure.    After the deportation hearings, the\n\nimmigration judge denied both requests on December 13, 1996.\n\nThe immigration judge denied the request for voluntary departure\n\nboth because she determined he was ineligible under the statute\n\n(not having shown he was a person of good moral character) and\n\nas a matter of her discretion under the statute. 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1229c(b)(1) (Supp. II 1996).\n\n         Nascimento filed a timely appeal with the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which the BIA denied on June 22,\n\n2000.   The BIA upheld the denial of voluntary departure on\n\ndiscretionary   grounds,   without    affirming   or   reversing   the\n\n                               -2-\n\fImmigration Judge's finding that Nascimento was statutorily\n\nineligible for relief.          The BIA found Nascimento had not\n\n\"convinced [it] that he did not make [a series of] misstatements\n\n. . . or that he had a valid excuse for failing to honor his\n\nprevious promise to voluntarily depart the United States.\"\n\nNascimento did not timely seek judicial review of the BIA's\n\norder.\n\n         Nascimento did, however, file a timely motion with the\n\nBIA to reconsider. The federal regulation governing motions for\n\nreconsideration states that such motions \"shall state the\n\nreasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law\n\nin the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent\n\nauthority.\"    8   C.F.R.   §    3.2(b)(1)   (2001).        Nonetheless,\n\nNascimento's motion for reconsideration stated only:\n\n    1. BIA improperly considered evidence of Respondent's\n    eligilbility [sic] and period of residence in the\n    United States;\n    2.    BIA misconstrued or overlooked the evidence\n    regarding Respondent's moral character and\n    3. Respondent reserves the opportunity to raise\n    additional issues for reconsideration regarding both\n    his request for voluntary departure and cancellation.\n\nNothing        else         was         filed          or       said.\n\n          The BIA denied the motion to reconsider on February\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f9, 2001.      Nascimento then filed with this court a timely\n\npetition for review of the BIA's order denying reconsideration.\n\n           The petition is governed by the transition rules of the\n\nIllegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of\n\n1996 § 309(c), Pub. L. No. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (1996)\n\n(\"IIRIRA\").    The petition does not ask for review of the BIA's\n\naffirmance of the denial of suspension of deportation, and so\n\nNascimento has waived that issue. See Rojas-Reynoso v. INS, 235\n\nF.3d 26, 29 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           Both parties have briefed the case as though the\n\nsubstance of the BIA's June 22, 2000 denial of voluntary\n\ndeparture were at issue. The INS says judicial review over that\n\ndecision is barred by the jurisdictional limits set forth in\n\nIIRIRA § 309(c)(4)(E).   Nascimento, in turn, attempts to attack\n\nthe merits of the Immigration Judge's decision to deny voluntary\n\ndeparture.    We do not consider the merits of the voluntary\n\ndeparture denial to be before us, as no timely petition was\n\nfiled in this court from the June 22, 2000 order.    Under IIRIRA\n\n§ 309(c)(4)(C), such petitions for review must be filed within\n\nthirty days of the BIA's final order.      This time period runs\n\nfrom the date of the BIA's affirmance of the Immigration Judge's\n\n                                -4-\n\forder, not from the BIA's denial of reconsideration.           See Stone\n\nv.   INS, 514 U.S. 386, 405-06 (1995) (holding that filing motion\n\nfor reconsideration does not toll the period for filing a\n\npetition   for   judicial   review      of      underlying     order   of\n\ndeportation).\n\n           Thus, the only issue before us is whether the BIA\n\nabused its discretion in denying the motion for reconsideration.\n\nWe have jurisdiction over that issue under our holding in\n\nBernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56 (1st Cir. 1999), which states\n\nthat   IIRIRA    §   309(c)(4)(E)      precludes      review   only    of\n\ndiscretionary decisions under the sections enumerated in §\n\n309(c)(4)(E). Id. at 59-60. Motions for reconsideration do not\n\nfall under one of those enumerated sections.           Luis v. INS, 196\n\nF.3d 36, 39 (1st Cir. 1999).           The BIA's decision to deny\n\nreconsideration is    reviewed   for    abuse    of   discretion, id.,\n\nmeaning that it must be upheld unless it \"was made without a\n\nrational explanation, inexplicably departed from established\n\npolicies, or rested on an impermissible basis.\" LeBlanc v. INS,\n\n715 F.2d 685, 693 (1st Cir. 1983) (quoting Balani v. INS, 669\n\nF.2d 1157, 1161 (6th Cir. 1982)).            It was not any of those\n\nthings.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f         The   BIA   said   it   denied   reconsideration   because\n\nNascimento's stated reasons were \"conclusory, unsupported by the\n\nrecord, and insufficiently detailed to serve as a basis for a\n\ngrant of the respondent's motion to reconsider.\"     We agree.\n\n         The petition for review is dismissed and the stay of\n\ndeportation, which the INS did not oppose, is vacated.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
