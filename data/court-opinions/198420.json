Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n     Aldrich and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nRobert J. Gilbert with whom Jeffrey B. Renton and Gilbert &amp;\r\nRenton, P.C. were on brief for appellant.\r\nWilliam B. Koffel with whom Foley, Hoag &amp; Eliot was on brief\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\nApril 9, 1999\r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Elaine Valerio appeals\r\nfrom the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\nAppellee Putnam Associates, Inc. (\"Putnam\").  Valerio sued Putnam\r\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.  201 et seq. (\"the\r\nFLSA\"), and Massachusetts law, claiming that she was entitled to\r\nexcess pay for overtime hours worked during her employment with\r\nPutnam, and that she was terminated in retaliation for requesting\r\nsuch pay.  She now contends that the district court applied an\r\nincorrect measure in calculating her overtime pay and erred in\r\nruling that her complaint to her supervisors was not protected\r\nactivity.  We affirm the district court's rulings regarding her\r\nclaim for overtime pay and her claim for retaliation under\r\nMassachusetts law, but reverse the lower court's ruling as to her\r\nclaim for retaliation under the FLSA.    \r\n\n                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\nIn October, 1994, Valerio was hired by Putnam, a health-\r\ncare consulting firm, for a \"Receptionist/Administrative Assistant\"\r\nposition.  Her duties included answering telephones, receiving\r\npackages, performing research from libraries and on-line databases,\r\nmaintaining client files, and other miscellaneous tasks.  Putnam\r\ntold her at the time she was hired that the position was considered\r\n\"exempt\" under the FLSA and she therefore would not be entitled to\r\novertime pay (the district court later determined that this\r\nclassification was incorrect).\r\nIn June, 1995, as part of Putnam's normal employee review\r\nprocess, Valerio submitted a form entitled \"Performance Review/Self\r\nEvaluation.\"  She wrote that she hoped she would be \"relieved of\r\nall receptionist duties and [would instead] concentrate on research\r\nand admin[istration].\"  Valerio's immediate supervisor, Office\r\nManager Lisa Patterson, responded to Valerio's comments by telling\r\nher that the company did not anticipate relieving her from\r\nreceptionist duties anytime soon.  She also gave Valerio an oral\r\nevaluation of her performance, reminding her that she needed to be\r\nat the office at 8:30 a.m. to answer incoming phone calls.\r\nTwo months later, in August, 1995, Valerio began\r\nattending law school classes during the evenings.  During the first\r\nweek of that month, Patterson again met with Valerio to discuss her\r\njob performance and expressed concern with Valerio's punctuality. \r\nIn order to determine whether her admonitions were effective,\r\nPatterson began keeping a written record of Valerio's daily arrival\r\nand departure times.  She did not tell Valerio she was doing this.\r\nOn September 7, 1995, Patterson wrote a lengthy letter to\r\nValerio which stated in part:\r\n     Punctuality.  No matter what you believe as far as this\r\n     job was described to you (i.e. you claim it was never\r\n     expressly mentioned that this was a receptionist\r\n     position) you were and are aware that answering the phone\r\n     is part of the job.  This means being here when the\r\n     office officially opens at 8:30 a.m. and staying till it\r\n     closes.\r\n\nPatterson also stated that Valerio's recent enrollment in law\r\nschool night classes suggested that she was not \"serious about a\r\ncareer with Putnam.\"\r\nOn September 12, 1995, Valerio responded by letter.  She\r\nwrote in part:\r\nI will repeat to you once again that I am not\r\na receptionist.  I am classified as an exempt,\r\nsalaried employee and according to the Fair\r\nLabor Standards Act published by the\r\nDepartment of Labor, a receptionist, by the\r\nnature of the job, not the title, cannot be an\r\nexempt employee.  If you insist on classifying\r\nme as a receptionist, then I demand under FLSA\r\nthat I be reclassified as non-exempt and be\r\npaid for all overtime hours worked.  My\r\nsalary, offer letter and business cards all\r\nindicate that my position is Research\r\nAssociate.  Answering the phones is only one\r\npart of my job . . . Additionally, I feel I\r\nmust disclose to you that I am considering\r\ncomplaint options and have contacted the\r\nDepartment of Labor.  I would also remind you\r\nthat, \"It is a violation of the Fair Labor and\r\nStandards Act (FLSA) to fire and in any manner\r\ndiscriminate against an employee for filing a\r\ncomplaint or participating in a legal\r\nproceeding under FLSA\" and that \"willfull\r\nviolations of FLSA may be prosecuted\r\ncriminally and the violator fined up to ten\r\nthousand dollars.\" . . . If you retract your\r\nletter and abide by the terms of my employment\r\nagreement, I will walk away from these issues\r\nwith our professional relationship intact.  I\r\nwill be diligent in my job performance (as my\r\nlast raise attests) and hold ho hard feelings. \r\nI would appreciate it if any further\r\ncommunications on this matter be in writing.\r\n\nOn September 19, 1995, Kevin Gorman, Putnam's CEO,\r\nterminated Valerio, stating that the introduction of a new network\r\nmodem system had eliminated the need for a Research Associate. \r\nGorman gave her a letter confirming her termination and a final\r\npaycheck that included $1,660.59, which the letter stated was \"the\r\nequivalent of overtime pay which might be applicable under the\r\nDepartment of Labor FLSA Regulation 20 C.F.R.  778.114.\"  Gorman\r\nlater testified under deposition that Valerio's deteriorating\r\nrelationship with Patterson was the \"straw that broke the camel's\r\nback.\"     \r\nValerio then instituted the present action.  The district\r\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of Putnam, holding that,\r\nwhile Valerio was a non-exempt employee and thus entitled to\r\novertime pay under the FLSA, Putnam's $1,660.59 severance payment\r\nwas more than what was required by the applicable \"half-time\"\r\novertime provisions.  The lower court also dismissed her claims for\r\nretaliatory termination, ruling that her sending the September 12,\r\n1995, letter to her supervisors did not constitute protected\r\nactivity under the FLSA or Massachusetts law.  Valerio appeals,\r\nchallenging each of these rulings. \r\n\n                     II. DISCUSSION\r\n\nA.  The Overtime Pay Claim\r\nThe parties do not contest the district court's\r\nconclusion that Valerio was entitled to overtime pay under the\r\nFLSA.  They dispute only the amount. \r\nThe FLSA's basic overtime provision states,\r\n[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this\r\nsection, no employer shall employ any of his\r\nemployees who in any workweek is engaged in\r\ncommerce or in the production of goods in\r\ncommerce, or is employed in an enterprise\r\nengaged in commerce or in the production of\r\ngoods for commerce, for a workweek longer than\r\nforty hours unless such employee receives\r\ncompensation for his employment in excess of\r\nthe hours above specified at a rate not less\r\nthan one and one-half times the regular rate\r\nat which he is employed.\r\n\n29 U.S.C.  207(a)(1).  The phrase \"the regular rate at which [an\r\nemployee] is employed\" is not self-defining.  See Martin v. Tango's\r\nRestaurant, Inc., 969 F.2d 1319, 1324 (1st Cir. 1992).  Rather, the\r\nSupreme Court \"has glossed the governing language . . . in the case\r\nof 'an employee working irregular hours for a fixed weekly wage'\r\nwhere the hours regularly exceeded 40 hours a week.\"  Id.  (quoting\r\nOvernight Motor Transp. Co. v. Missel, 316 U.S. 572, 573-74\r\n(1942)).  This gloss is reflected in the overtime compensation\r\nregulations, which provide two methods by which to  calculate an\r\nemployee's \"regular rate\" of pay.  The first applies if the\r\nemployee is paid a fixed weekly salary for a specific number of\r\nhours to be worked each week.  29 C.F.R.  778.113(a) (\"Section\r\n113\").  The second applies if the employee is paid a fixed weekly\r\nsalary regardless of how many hours the employee may work in a\r\ngiven week.  Id. at  114(a) (\"Section 114\").\r\nBy its own terms, Section 114 applies only if there is \"a\r\nclear mutual understanding of the parties\" that the fixed salary is\r\ncompensation for however many hours the employee may work in a\r\nparticular week, rather than for a fixed number of hours per week. \r\nIn granting summary judgment for Putnam, the district court found\r\nthat there was no genuine dispute that, at the time Valerio was\r\nhired, she knew that her weekly hours would fluctuate.  Valerio\r\nargues that her deposition testimony suggests otherwise.  We have\r\nread the testimony with care and disagree.\r\nWe agree with the district court that, even viewed in a\r\nlight most favorable to Valerio, the deposition testimony\r\ndemonstrates that Valerio understood that her fixed weekly salary\r\nwas to be compensation for potentially fluctuating weekly hours. \r\nShe admits she was told that the hours were indefinite   \"8:30 to\r\nwhenever\"   and that she understood that there \"possibly\" could be\r\nwork days that would last longer than eight hours.  She also\r\nunderstood, and accepted at the time, that Putnam did not intend to\r\nprovide overtime pay if she worked more than 40 hours in a\r\nparticular week.\r\nAdditionally, the evidence of the parties' post-hiring\r\nconduct reinforces Putnam's contention that Valerio understood that\r\nher salary was to compensate her for fluctuating hours.  During the\r\nfirst eleven months of her employment, Valerio routinely worked\r\nwithout complaint more than 40 hours per week without extra pay. \r\nSee Mayhew v. Wells, 125 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir. 1997) (\"[T]he\r\nexistence of [a 'clear mutual understanding'] may be based on the\r\nimplied terms of one's employment agreement if it is clear from the\r\nemployee's action that he or she understood the payment plan in\r\nspite of after-the-fact verbal contentions otherwise.\"); Zoltek v.\r\nSafelite Glass Corp., 884 F. Supp. 283, 286-87 (N.D. Ill. 1995)\r\n(court inferred an \"implied-in-fact agreement\" that employee was to\r\nreceive the same salary regardless of how many hours worked where\r\nhe had worked fluctuating hours for 30 months for a consistent\r\nsalary and never protested).  \r\nValerio contends that this inference is tantamount to\r\n\"blaming the victim.\"  The question, however, is simply the narrow\r\none of applying Section 114 in accordance with its terms, which\r\nmeans determining whether there existed a \"clear mutual\r\nunderstanding\" that Valerio's fixed salary would be compensation\r\nfor however many hours she worked each week.  If so, Section 114\r\napplies for purposes of calculating \"the regular rate at which [the\r\nemployee] . . . is employed.\"  The evidence demonstrates without\r\nmaterial contradiction such a \"clear mutual understanding.\" \r\nValerio argues that section 114 requires that the \"clear\r\nmutual understanding\" must extend to how her overtime premiums\r\nshould be calculated.  Because the parties initially agreed that\r\nshe would not receive any additional payments for overtime hours,\r\nno agreement regarding calculation of overtime existed.  But the\r\nregulation calls for no such enlarged understanding.  See Bailey v.\r\nCounty of Georgetown, 94 F.3d 152, 156-57 (4th Cir. 1996) (rejecting\r\nas \"contrary to the plain language of the FLSA and [Section 114]\"\r\nthe notion that employers and employees who have adopted a\r\nfluctuating pay plan must understand the manner in which overtime\r\npay will calculated).  The parties must only have reached a \"clear\r\nmutual understanding\" that while the employee's hours may vary, his\r\nor her base salary will not. \r\nIn short, the district court correctly applied Section\r\n114.  And, because Valerio received even more overtime payment\r\n($1,660.59) in her final paycheck than she was entitled to under\r\nSection 114, Putnam's obligation under the FLSA was extinguished\r\nand summary judgment was appropriate.  See 29 U.S.C.  216(b) (\"Any\r\nemployer who violates the provisions [of this Act] shall be liable\r\nto the employee . . . affected in the amount of [her] . . . unpaidovertime compensation[.]\") (emphasis supplied). \r\nMuch the same reasoning disposes of Valerio's claim under\r\nthe Massachusetts overtime statute.  Valerio argues that because\r\nthe Massachusetts statute has no analogue to Section 114, it\r\nrequires \"time-and-a-half\" overtime premiums be paid across-the-\r\nboard, even to employees who agreed to receive fixed salaries for\r\nfluctuating workweeks.  We do not agree.  The basic overtime\r\nprovision of the Massachusetts statute is essentially identical to\r\nthe FLSA.  Compare 29 U.S.C.  207(a)(1) with M.G.L. c. 151, 1A. \r\nMassachusetts adopted its nearly-identical statute almost twenty\r\nyears after the Supreme Court decided Overnight Motor and nearly a\r\ndecade before Overnight Motor's gloss was formally codified in\r\nSection 114.  The absence of a direct Massachusetts analogue to\r\nSection 114 is, therefore, immaterial.  To our knowledge, no\r\nMassachusetts court has even suggested the distinction Valerio\r\nseeks to advance, and, tellingly, she cites to no such case.  We\r\nconclude that both the FLSA and Massachusetts law compel the same\r\noutcomes.  Cf. Fakouri v. Pizza Hut of America, Inc., 824 F.2d 470\r\n(6th Cir. 1987).  \r\nB.  The Retaliation Claim\r\nThe district court granted summary judgment for Putnam on\r\nValerio's claim for retaliatory termination, ruling that her\r\ninternal complaint on September 12, 1995 was not protected activity\r\nunder either the FLSA or Massachusetts law.  We consider the\r\nfederal law and state law issues in turn.\r\n(1) Retaliation Under the FLSA\r\nThe FLSA's anti-retaliation provision states:\r\n[I]t shall be unlawful for any person to\r\ndischarge or in any other manner discriminate\r\nagainst any employee because such employee has\r\nfiled any complaint or instituted or caused to\r\nbe instituted any proceeding under or related\r\nto this chapter, or has testified or is about\r\nto testify in any such proceeding, or has\r\nserved or is about to serve on an industry\r\ncommittee[.]\r\n\n29 U.S.C. 215(a)(3).  The question raised here is of first\r\nimpression in this Circuit: whether FLSA's prohibition on\r\nterminating an employee who \"has filed any complaint or instituted\r\nor caused to be instituted any proceeding\" under or related to the\r\nFLSA protects an employee who has lodged a written internal\r\ncomplaint with his or her employer but has not filed a judicial or\r\nadministrative complaint.  Federal courts of appeals grappling with\r\nthis issue have differed.  To date, the Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, and\r\nEleventh Circuits have held that an internal complaint to the\r\nemployer may satisfy  215(a)(3), see EEOC v. Romeo Community\r\nSchools, 976 F.2d 985, 989-90 (6th Cir. 1992); EEOC v. White &amp; Son\r\nEnterprises, 881 F.2d 1006, 1011 (11th Cir. 1989); Love v. Re/Max\r\nof America, Inc., 738 F.2d 383, 387 (10th Cir. 1984); Brennan v.\r\nMaxey's Yamaha, Inc., 513 F.2d 179, 181 (8th Cir. 1975), while the\r\nSecond and Ninth Circuits have held that a formal complaint to the\r\ngovernment agency or a court is required.  See Lambert v. Ackerly,\r\n156 F.3d 1018 (9th Cir. 1998); Lambert v. Genesee Hospital, 10 F.3d\r\n46 (2d Cir. 1993).\r\nThis is indeed a close question, but we side with the\r\nSixth, Eighth, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  In deciding that the\r\nFLSA's protections against retaliation are triggered only by a\r\nformal filing with a court or agency, the Second and Ninth Circuits\r\nconcluded that  215(a)(3) is unambiguous.  See Ackerly, 156 F.3d\r\nat 1024; Genesee Hospital, 10 F.3d at 55.  We do not agree.  We\r\nread the phrase \"has filed any complaint\" as susceptible to\r\ndiffering interpretations.  The word \"complaint\" itself is\r\ncertainly ambiguous.  Webster defines \"complaint\" as either \"the\r\nact or action of expressing protest, censure, or resentment:\r\nexpression of injustice ([for example] about poor housing)\" or as\r\na \"formal allegation or charge against a party made or presented to\r\nthe appropriate court or officer (as for a wrong done or a crime\r\ncommitted) and variously applied . . . \"  Webster's Third New Int'l\r\nDictionary 464 (1971).  By failing to specify that the filing of\r\nany complaint need be with a court or an agency, and by using the\r\nword \"any,\" Congress left open the possibility that it intended\r\n\"complaint\" to relate to less formal expressions of protest,\r\ncensure, resentment, or injustice conveyed to an employer.  Cf.Clean Harbors Environ. Serv., Inc. v. Herman, 146 F.3d 12, 19 &amp; n.7\r\n(1st Cir. 1998) (concluding that the phrase \"filed a complaint or\r\nbegun a proceeding\" in the anti-retaliation provision of the\r\nSurface Transportation Assistance Act, 49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(A),\r\nis ambiguous because \"the language does not say where a complaint\r\nmust be filed\").  \r\nThe strongest case for non-ambiguity rests perhaps with\r\nthe verb \"filed.\"  Had Congress spoken of \"making\" or \"voicing\" any\r\ncomplaint there would be no question it intended to include\r\nprotests as well as purely \"legal\" complaints.  Webster defines\r\n\"file\" both as \"to deliver (as a legal paper or instrument) after\r\ncomplying with any condition precedent (as the payment of a fee) to\r\nthe proper officer for keeping on file or among the records of his\r\noffice\" and \"to place (as a paper or an instrument) on file among\r\nthe legal or official records of an office esp[ecially] by formally\r\nreceiving, endorsing, and entering.\" Webster's Third New\r\nInternational Dictionary, at 849.  But while file doubtless\r\nformalizes matters, the second definition of \"file\" is sufficiently\r\nelastic to encompass an internal complaint made to a private\r\nemployer with the expectation the employer will place it on file\r\namong the employer's official records.  Compare Lundervold v.\r\nCore-Mark Int'l, Inc., 1997 WL 907915 (D. Or. Jan. 17, 1997)\r\n(concluding that interpreting the word \"filed\" in  215 (a)(3) to\r\nrequire a written complaint \"[i]nstead of simplifying matters, . .\r\n. simply trade[s] one set of problems for another.\") \r\nFurthermore, if \"filed any complaint\" were read to\r\nencompass only filings with a court or government agency, one would\r\nwonder why the additional language \"or instituted or caused to be\r\ninstituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter\" was\r\ninserted.  The latter words become surplusage if the former means\r\nonly the filing of in-court or in-agency complaints.  See Clean\r\nHarbors, 146 F.3d at 20.  When engaged in statutory interpretation,\r\ncourts may \"assume that Congress used two terms because it intended\r\neach term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning.\"  Bailey v.\r\nUnited States, 516 U.S. 137, 146 (1995).           \r\nMoreover, the word \"any\" embraces all types of\r\ncomplaints, including those that might be filed with an employer. \r\nWe conclude, therefore, that the statute does not have a plain\r\nlanguage meaning restricted to \"legal\" complaints but rather is\r\nambiguous as to the meaning of the word \"complaint.\"  Given that\r\nambiguity, we look further to discern Congress's intent.  \r\nThe legislative history of the FLSA unfortunately\r\nprovides no real guidance as to the intended scope of  215(a)(3). \r\nWe find some assistance, however, in the broad purpose of the FLSA,\r\nas interpreted by the Supreme Court.  The FLSA has been treated as\r\nremedial in purpose.  See Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co. v. Muscoda\r\nLocal No. 123, 321 U.S. 590, 597 (1944).  \"For . . . practical and\r\nother reasons,\" Congress sought to secure compliance with the\r\nsubstantive provisions of the Act by having \"employees seeking to\r\nvindicate rights claimed to have been denied\" lodge complaints or\r\nsupply information to officials regarding allegedly substandard\r\nemployment practices and conditions.  Mitchell v. Robert DeMario\r\nJewelry, Inc., 361 U.S. 288, 292 (1960).  Congress recognized that\r\n\"fear of economic retaliation might often operate to induce\r\naggrieved employees quietly to accept substandard conditions.\"  Id. \r\nThe Supreme Court has stated that the FLSA \"must not be\r\ninterpreted in a narrow, grudging manner.\"  Tennessee Coal, 321\r\nU.S. at 597.  The Court also spoke of the \"remedial and\r\nhumanitarian\" purposes of the Act, id., which, as we explain infra,\r\nwould hardly be furthered by a narrow reading of  215(a)(3). \r\nUnder a construction limiting the protections of the anti-\r\nretaliation provision to the filing of judicial or agency\r\ncomplaints, an employer would be free to discharge an employee in\r\nretaliation for asserting rights under the Act, so long as the\r\nemployer acted prior to the formal filing of such a complaint or\r\nthe institution of a proceeding under the Act.  By protecting only\r\nthose employees who kept secret their belief that they were being\r\nillegally treated until they filed a legal proceeding, the Act\r\nwould discourage prior discussion of the matter between employee\r\nand employer, and would have the bizarre effect both of\r\ndiscouraging early settlement attempts and creating an incentive\r\nfor the employer to fire an employee as soon as possible after\r\nlearning the employee believed he was being treated illegally.  \r\nA narrow construction of the anti-retaliation provision\r\ncould create an atmosphere of intimidation and defeat the Act's\r\npurpose in  215(a)(3) of preventing employees' attempts to secure\r\ntheir rights under the Act from taking on the character of \"a\r\ncalculated risk.\"  Mitchell, 361 U.S. at 293.  Such circumstances\r\nwould fail to \"foster a climate in which compliance with the\r\nsubstantive provisions of the Act would be enhanced.\"  Id. at 292. \r\nHence we, like many of our sister circuits, conclude that the\r\nanimating spirit of the Act is best served by a construction of \r\n215(a)(3) under which the filing of a relevant complaint with the\r\nemployer no less than with a court or agency may give rise to a\r\nretaliation claim. \r\nOur own precedent in a closely related area supports this\r\ninterpretation.  In Clean Harbors, a panel of this Court\r\ninterpreted very similar language in the anti-retaliation provision\r\nof the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (\"STAA\") to\r\ninclude internal employee complaints.  The STAA's anti-retaliation\r\nprovision states:\r\nA person may not discharge an employee\r\nregarding pay, terms, or privileges of\r\nemployment because the employee, or another\r\nperson at the employee's request, has filed a\r\ncomplaint or begun a proceeding related to a\r\nviolation of a commercial motor vehicle safety\r\nregulation, standard, or order, or has\r\ntestified or will testify in such a\r\nproceeding[.]\r\n\n49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(A).  The Clean Harbors panel concluded that\r\nthis language protected an employee who had filed purely\r\n\"intracorporate\" complaints about alleged violations of federal\r\ntransportation safety law.  See Clean Harbors, 146 F.3d at 14.  \r\nThe panel cited four bases for its decision.  First, the\r\nstatutory language was ambiguous, in that it did not specify where\r\na complaint must be filed.  Id. at 19 &amp; n.7.  Second, \"Congress\r\nhewed to this language when it reenacted the STAA in 1994, in the\r\nface of long-standing administrative interpretation of the STAA and\r\nsimilar language in other statutes to encompass internal complaints\r\nmade to an employer.\"  Id. at 19.  One of the cited \"other\r\nstatutes\" with \"similar language\" was the FLSA; the panel referred\r\nto the courts of appeals decisions interpreting  215(a)(3) to\r\nencompass internal complaints.  See id. at 20.  The panel also\r\ncited other decisions that interpreted analogous whistleblower\r\nprotection provisions in the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.  1367(a),\r\nand the Federal Railway Safety Act, 45 U.S.C.  441.  Third, the\r\npanel explained that it owed deference to the Department of\r\nTransportation's interpretation under Chevron because \"in the\r\nabsence of unambiguous statutory language, this strikes us as the\r\nsort of interstitial law making which Congress left to the agency.\" \r\nClean Harbors, 146 F.3d at 19.  Fourth, the panel described the\r\nagency's policy choice to protect internal complaints to employers\r\nas \"eminently reasonable.\"  Id. \r\nPutnam contends that Clean Harbors should not guide our\r\ndecision as some of the factors animating the Clean Harborsdecision are not present here.  The factor of legislative\r\nacquiescence is not present here and, as explained previously, we\r\ndiscern no statement of agency position sufficient for deference\r\nunder the principles of Chevron.  See supra, n.5.  Putnam asserts\r\nfurther that Clean Harbors is of limited value to the present issue\r\nbecause the FLSA and the STAA have \"very different purposes and\r\nenforcement schemes\" that demand different interpretations of their\r\nrespective anti-retaliation provisions.  Putnam's argument, in\r\nessence, is that because the STAA concerns public health and\r\nsafety, it is essential that employees be encouraged to inform\r\ntheir supervisors of regulatory violations immediately so that they\r\ncan be promptly remedied; in the FLSA context, however, the need\r\nfor dispatch is diminished.  Because violations of the FLSA do not\r\npose direct and immediate threats to public safety, Putnam asserts,\r\nCongress must have intended to require FLSA complainants to avail\r\nthemselves of judicial or administrative remedies.\r\nWhile the above contentions have some force, they are not\r\nwholly persuasive.  The need for dispatch in correcting safety\r\nviolations is only one of the many objects of the STAA's anti-\r\nretaliation regime.  As the Clean Harbors panel explained, forcing\r\nemployees with safety concerns to go straight to the government\r\nwould deny the company an opportunity to \"remedy its own problems\r\nvoluntarily and quietly.\"  Id. at 21.  Internal complaints may be\r\nseen as benefitting not only the employee, but the employer as\r\nwell.  Id. See also id. at 19 (recognizing the value of \"leveraging\r\nthe government's limited enforcement resources\").  Finally, and\r\nperhaps most importantly, the Clean Harbors court noted the value\r\nof protecting employees \"who in good faith assert safety concerns\r\nto their employers, or who indicate an unwillingness to engage in\r\nsuch violations\" by \"casting a broad net in the [field of] anti-\r\nretaliation provisions.\"  Id. at 21.  The Clean Harbors panel\r\nrecognized, as we do supra, that \"fear of economic retaliation\r\nmight operate to induce aggrieved employees to accept substandard\r\nconditions.\"  Mitchell, 361 U.S. at 292.  In sum, many of the\r\nanimating policies cited by the Clean Harbors panel apply with\r\nequal force to violations of the FLSA.  \r\nWe hold, therefore, that the FLSA's anti-retaliation\r\nprovision will protect an employee who has filed a sufficient\r\ncomplaint with an employer.  \r\nOf course, not all abstract grumblings will suffice to\r\nconstitute the filing of a complaint with one's employer.  As the\r\nClean Harbors panel acknowledged, affording protection to employees\r\nwho lodge purely intracorporate complaints \"unhelpfully leaves\r\nemployers in the dark\" as to what types of assertions will rise to\r\nthe level of protected activity by their employees.  Clean Harbors,\r\n146 F.3d at 21.  We agree that \"[t]here is a point at which an\r\nemployee's concerns and comments are too generalized and informal\r\nto constitute 'complaints' that are 'filed' with an employer within\r\nthe meaning of the [statute.]\" Id. at 22.  Even putting oral\r\ncomplaints aside, as we do in this case, see note 4, supra, written\r\ncomments and criticisms made to an employer may not always amount\r\nto filed complaints \"under or related to this chapter.\"  29 U.S.C.\r\n215(a)(3).  We conclude, as did the panel in Clean Harbors, that\r\nwe have little choice but to proceed on a case-by-case basis,\r\naddressing as a matter of factual analysis whether the internal\r\ncommunications to the employer were sufficient to amount to the\r\n\"filing of any complaint\" within the statutory definition.\r\nHere, we conclude that Valerio's September 12, 1995\r\nletter was sufficiently definite to notify Putnam that she was\r\nasserting her statutory rights to overtime pay.  She wrote to Lisa\r\nPatterson, who was her direct supervisor and Putnam's Office\r\nManager, that, at least as long as she was required to be a\r\nreceptionist, she was misclassified as exempt under the FLSA, and\r\nwas entitled to overtime pay.  While Valerio seems also to have\r\nindicated a preference to remain as a Research Associate and\r\nperhaps therefore an exempt employee (foregoing the receptionist\r\nlabel), she stated she was \"considering complaint options and have\r\ncontacted the Department of Labor.\"  She quoted the  relevant\r\nstatutory language regarding her claim and threatened legal action\r\nif retaliation took place. \r\nPutnam insists that the letter should be read not as a\r\ncomplaint itself, but merely a negotiating tool, with the\r\npossibility of a complaint to the Department of Labor to follow if\r\nValerio's demands were not met.  Putnam emphasizes that the letter\r\nconcludes with a statement in the conditional form: \"If you retract\r\nyour letter and abide by the terms of my employment agreement, I\r\nwill walk away from these issues with our professional relationship\r\nintact.\"  \r\nWe disagree with Putnam's argument for several reasons. \r\nFirst, it presupposes that a \"complaint\" under the FLSA must be\r\nfiled with the administrative agency, a notion which, as explained\r\npreviously, we reject.  Second, it overlooks the very explicit\r\nreferences to the FLSA and Valerio's stated intention to pursue\r\nremedies under the Act if Putnam failed to meet her concerns.  SeeClean Harbors, 146 F.3d at 21.  Other courts have classified as\r\n\"complaints\" statements far less definite than those here.  SeeRomeo Community Schools, 976 F.2d at 989 (plaintiff who told school\r\ndistrict that she believed they were \"breaking some sort of law\" by\r\npaying her lower wages than previously paid to male employees had\r\n\"filed any complaint\" under the FLSA); White &amp; Son Enterprises, 881\r\nF.2d at 1007-08 (female employees who met with company owner and\r\nforeman and asked for equal pay had \"filed any complaint\").  Third,\r\nwhile the letter ends with an olive branch, its tone and overall\r\ncontent could not have left Putnam with any doubt that Valerio was\r\ncomplaining that she was mis-classified and was asserting her right\r\nto overtime pay, unless, at least, Putnam was prepared to\r\nreclassify her in accordance with her wishes.  Putnam never did so\r\n-- and it now concedes Valerio was all along entitled to overtime\r\npay.  We do not think it lies in Putnam's mouth to claim the\r\nbenefit of a condition it at all times rejected.  We, therefore,\r\nreject Putnam's contention that Valerio's letter was not a\r\nprotected complaint but merely some form of unprotected negotiating\r\ntool. \r\n(2) Retaliation Under Massachusetts Law\r\nWe must also consider how our explication of the FLSA\r\nrequirements affects Valerio's retaliation claim under\r\nMassachusetts law, as she had alleged that \"[a]nalogous protections\r\nexist under state law.\"  See Complaint,  23.  The district court\r\ndismissed this claim, ruling that Massachusetts does not appear to\r\nrecognize a common law cause of action where the relevant public\r\npolicy has already been vindicated by a state or federal statute. \r\nWe agree, relying principally upon the decision of the\r\nMassachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") in Melley v. Gillette\r\nCorp., 491 N.E.2d 252 (Mass. 1986).  \r\nIn Melley, the SJC was asked to decide whether a\r\nplaintiff who had failed to follow the procedures set forth in\r\nMassachusetts' employment discrimination statute, M.G.L. c. 151B,\r\ncould nevertheless bring an age discrimination claim based on a\r\ncommon law theory of wrongful termination.  The SJC adopted the\r\nanalysis and conclusion of the intermediate appellate court, which\r\nhad reasoned: \"[t]he rationale for implying a private remedy under\r\nthe 'public policy exception' to the traditional rule governing at-\r\nwill employment contracts is that, unless a remedy is recognized,\r\nthere is no other way to vindicate such a public policy.\"  Melleyv. Gillette Corp., 475 N.E.2d 1277, 1228 (Mass. App. 1985)\r\n(citations omitted).  The intermediate court concluded that \"where,\r\nas here, there is a comprehensive remedial statute, the creation of\r\na new common law action based on the public policy expressed in\r\nthat statute would interfere with that remedial scheme.\"  Id. at\r\n1229.\r\nTo be sure, Melley did not address the precise issue\r\npresented here, as it involved the effect of a comprehensive state\r\nstatute in the field, as opposed to a federal one.  However, were\r\nthe SJC faced with the present situation, we do not believe that\r\nthe federal nature of the statutory remedy would make a\r\ndifference.  Cf. Grubba v. Bay State Abrasives, 803 F.2d 746, 747\r\n&amp; n.1 (1st Cir. 1986)(assuming, without deciding, that Massachusetts\r\nwould not recognize a claim for breach of the implied covenant of\r\ngood faith and fair dealing if the public policy was already\r\nvindicated by the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973); compare,\r\ne.g., Conner v. Schnuck Markets, Inc., 121 F.3d 1390, 1399 (10th\r\nCir. 1997) (Kansas would not allow a common law cause of action for\r\nretaliatory discharge when the FLSA or state statute provides an\r\nadequate remedy), with Amos v. Oakdale Knitting Co., 416 S.E.2d\r\n166, 171 (N.C. 1992) (the existence of the FLSA or the state Wage\r\nand Hour Act does not render moot North Carolina's public policy\r\nexception unless there is federal preemption or the state statute\r\nsupplants the common law via exclusive remedies).\r\n                    III.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated, we affirm the district court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Putnam as to Valerio's claim\r\nfor overtime pay under the FLSA and Massachusetts' overtime\r\nstatute.  We vacate, however, the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment in Putnam's favor on Valerio's claim for retaliation under\r\nthe FLSA, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion.  Last, we affirm the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment in Putnam's favor on Valerio's claim for retaliation under\r\nMassachusetts law. \r\nSo ordered. \r\nEach party to bear its own costs.  \r\n",

Elaine Valerio appeals\r\nfrom the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\nAppellee Putnam Associates, Inc. (\"Putnam\").  Valerio sued Putnam\r\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act, 29 U.S.C.  201 et seq. (\"the\r\nFLSA\"), and Massachusetts law, claiming that she was entitled to\r\nexcess pay for overtime hours worked during her employment with\r\nPutnam, and that she was terminated in retaliation for requesting\r\nsuch pay.  She now contends that the district court applied an\r\nincorrect measure in calculating her overtime pay and erred in\r\nruling that her complaint to her supervisors was not protected\r\nactivity.  We affirm the district court's rulings regarding her\r\nclaim for overtime pay and her claim for retaliation under\r\nMassachusetts law, but reverse the lower court's ruling as to her\r\nclaim for retaliation under the FLSA.    \r\n\n                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\nIn October, 1994, Valerio was hired by Putnam, a health-\r\ncare consulting firm, for a \"Receptionist/Administrative Assistant\"\r\nposition.  Her duties included answering telephones, receiving\r\npackages, performing research from libraries and on-line databases,\r\nmaintaining client files, and other miscellaneous tasks.  Putnam\r\ntold her at the time she was hired that the position was considered\r\n\"exempt\" under the FLSA and she therefore would not be entitled to\r\novertime pay (the district court later determined that this\r\nclassification was incorrect).\r\nIn June, 1995, as part of Putnam's normal employee review\r\nprocess, Valerio submitted a form entitled \"Performance Review/Self\r\nEvaluation.\"  She wrote that she hoped she would be \"relieved of\r\nall receptionist duties and [would instead] concentrate on research\r\nand admin[istration].\"  Valerio's immediate supervisor, Office\r\nManager Lisa Patterson, responded to Valerio's comments by telling\r\nher that the company did not anticipate relieving her from\r\nreceptionist duties anytime soon.  She also gave Valerio an oral\r\nevaluation of her performance, reminding her that she needed to be\r\nat the office at 8:30 a.m. to answer incoming phone calls.\r\nTwo months later, in August, 1995, Valerio began\r\nattending law school classes during the evenings.  During the first\r\nweek of that month, Patterson again met with Valerio to discuss her\r\njob performance and expressed concern with Valerio's punctuality. \r\nIn order to determine whether her admonitions were effective,\r\nPatterson began keeping a written record of Valerio's daily arrival\r\nand departure times.  She did not tell Valerio she was doing this.\r\nOn September 7, 1995, Patterson wrote a lengthy letter to\r\nValerio which stated in part:\r\n     Punctuality.  No matter what you believe as far as this\r\n     job was described to you (i.e. you claim it was never\r\n     expressly mentioned that this was a receptionist\r\n     position) you were and are aware that answering the phone\r\n     is part of the job.  This means being here when the\r\n     office officially opens at 8:30 a.m. and staying till it\r\n     closes.\r\n\nPatterson also stated that Valerio's recent enrollment in law\r\nschool night classes suggested that she was not \"serious about a\r\ncareer with Putnam.\"\r\nOn September 12, 1995, Valerio responded by letter.  She\r\nwrote in part:\r\nI will repeat to you once again that I am not\r\na receptionist.  I am classified as an exempt,\r\nsalaried employee and according to the Fair\r\nLabor Standards Act published by the\r\nDepartment of Labor, a receptionist, by the\r\nnature of the job, not the title, cannot be an\r\nexempt employee.  If you insist on classifying\r\nme as a receptionist, then I demand under FLSA\r\nthat I be reclassified as non-exempt and be\r\npaid for all overtime hours worked.  My\r\nsalary, offer letter and business cards all\r\nindicate that my position is Research\r\nAssociate.  Answering the phones is only one\r\npart of my job . . . Additionally, I feel I\r\nmust disclose to you that I am considering\r\ncomplaint options and have contacted the\r\nDepartment of Labor.  I would also remind you\r\nthat, \"It is a violation of the Fair Labor and\r\nStandards Act (FLSA) to fire and in any manner\r\ndiscriminate against an employee for filing a\r\ncomplaint or participating in a legal\r\nproceeding under FLSA\" and that \"willfull\r\nviolations of FLSA may be prosecuted\r\ncriminally and the violator fined up to ten\r\nthousand dollars.\" . . . If you retract your\r\nletter and abide by the terms of my employment\r\nagreement, I will walk away from these issues\r\nwith our professional relationship intact.  I\r\nwill be diligent in my job performance (as my\r\nlast raise attests) and hold ho hard feelings. \r\nI would appreciate it if any further\r\ncommunications on this matter be in writing.\r\n\nOn September 19, 1995, Kevin Gorman, Putnam's CEO,\r\nterminated Valerio, stating that the introduction of a new network\r\nmodem system had eliminated the need for a Research Associate. \r\nGorman gave her a letter confirming her termination and a final\r\npaycheck that included $1,660.59, which the letter stated was \"the\r\nequivalent of overtime pay which might be applicable under the\r\nDepartment of Labor FLSA Regulation 20 C.F.R.  778.114.\"  Gorman\r\nlater testified under deposition that Valerio's deteriorating\r\nrelationship with Patterson was the \"straw that broke the camel's\r\nback.\"     \r\nValerio then instituted the present action.  The district\r\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of Putnam, holding that,\r\nwhile Valerio was a non-exempt employee and thus entitled to\r\novertime pay under the FLSA, Putnam's $1,660.59 severance payment\r\nwas more than what was required by the applicable \"half-time\"\r\novertime provisions.  The lower court also dismissed her claims for\r\nretaliatory termination, ruling that her sending the September 12,\r\n1995, letter to her supervisors did not constitute protected\r\nactivity under the FLSA or Massachusetts law.  Valerio appeals,\r\nchallenging each of these rulings. \r\n\n                     II. DISCUSSION\r\n\nA.  The Overtime Pay Claim\r\nThe parties do not contest the district court's\r\nconclusion that Valerio was entitled to overtime pay under the\r\nFLSA.  They dispute only the amount. \r\nThe FLSA's basic overtime provision states,\r\n[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this\r\nsection, no employer shall employ any of his\r\nemployees who in any workweek is engaged in\r\ncommerce or in the production of goods in\r\ncommerce, or is employed in an enterprise\r\nengaged in commerce or in the production of\r\ngoods for commerce, for a workweek longer than\r\nforty hours unless such employee receives\r\ncompensation for his employment in excess of\r\nthe hours above specified at a rate not less\r\nthan one and one-half times the regular rate\r\nat which he is employed.\r\n\n29 U.S.C.  207(a)(1).  The phrase \"the regular rate at which [an\r\nemployee] is employed\" is not self-defining.  See Martin v. Tango's\r\nRestaurant, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587248\"><a href=\"/opinion/587248/lynn-martin-secretary-of-labor-united-states-department-of-labor-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1324 (1st Cir. 1992).  Rather, the\r\nSupreme Court \"has glossed the governing language . . . in the case\r\nof 'an employee working irregular hours for a fixed weekly wage'\r\nwhere the hours regularly exceeded 40 hours a week.\"  Id.  (quoting\r\nOvernight Motor Transp. Co. v. Missel, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103704\"><a href=\"/opinion/103704/overnight-motor-transp-co-v-missel/\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573-74\r\n(1942)).  This gloss is reflected in the overtime compensation\r\nregulations, which provide two methods by which to  calculate an\r\nemployee's \"regular rate\" of pay.  The first applies if the\r\nemployee is paid a fixed weekly salary for a specific number of\r\nhours to be worked each week.  29 C.F.R.  778.113(a) (\"Section\r\n113\").  The second applies if the employee is paid a fixed weekly\r\nsalary regardless of how many hours the employee may work in a\r\ngiven week.  Id. at  114(a) (\"Section 114\").\r\nBy its own terms, Section 114 applies only if there is \"a\r\nclear mutual understanding of the parties\" that the fixed salary is\r\ncompensation for however many hours the employee may work in a\r\nparticular week, rather than for a fixed number of hours per week. \r\nIn granting summary judgment for Putnam, the district court found\r\nthat there was no genuine dispute that, at the time Valerio was\r\nhired, she knew that her weekly hours would fluctuate.  Valerio\r\nargues that her deposition testimony suggests otherwise.  We have\r\nread the testimony with care and disagree.\r\nWe agree with the district court that, even viewed in a\r\nlight most favorable to Valerio, the deposition testimony\r\ndemonstrates that Valerio understood that her fixed weekly salary\r\nwas to be compensation for potentially fluctuating weekly hours. \r\nShe admits she was told that the hours were indefinite   \"8:30 to\r\nwhenever\"   and that she understood that there \"possibly\" could be\r\nwork days that would last longer than eight hours.  She also\r\nunderstood, and accepted at the time, that Putnam did not intend to\r\nprovide overtime pay if she worked more than 40 hours in a\r\nparticular week.\r\nAdditionally, the evidence of the parties' post-hiring\r\nconduct reinforces Putnam's contention that Valerio understood that\r\nher salary was to compensate her for fluctuating hours.  During the\r\nfirst eleven months of her employment, Valerio routinely worked\r\nwithout complaint more than 40 hours per week without extra pay. \r\nSee Mayhew v. Wells, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746443\"><a href=\"/opinion/746443/douglas-e-mayhew-v-carl-h-wells-sheriff/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218 (4th Cir. 1997) (\"[T]he\r\nexistence of [a 'clear mutual understanding'] may be based on the\r\nimplied terms of one's employment agreement if it is clear from the\r\nemployee's action that he or she understood the payment plan in\r\nspite of after-the-fact verbal contentions otherwise.\"); Zoltek v.\r\nSafelite Glass Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1388869\"><a href=\"/opinion/1388869/zoltek-v-safelite-glass-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 286-87 (N.D. Ill. 1995)\r\n(court inferred an \"implied-in-fact agreement\" that employee was to\r\nreceive the same salary regardless of how many hours worked where\r\nhe had worked fluctuating hours for 30 months for a consistent\r\nsalary and never protested).  \r\nValerio contends that this inference is tantamount to\r\n\"blaming the victim.\"  The question, however, is simply the narrow\r\none of applying Section 114 in accordance with its terms, which\r\nmeans determining whether there existed a \"clear mutual\r\nunderstanding\" that Valerio's fixed salary would be compensation\r\nfor however many hours she worked each week.  If so, Section 114\r\napplies for purposes of calculating \"the regular rate at which [the\r\nemployee] . . . is employed.\"  The evidence demonstrates without\r\nmaterial contradiction such a \"clear mutual understanding.\" \r\nValerio argues that section 114 requires that the \"clear\r\nmutual understanding\" must extend to how her overtime premiums\r\nshould be calculated.  Because the parties initially agreed that\r\nshe would not receive any additional payments for overtime hours,\r\nno agreement regarding calculation of overtime existed.  But the\r\nregulation calls for no such enlarged understanding.  See Bailey v.\r\nCounty of Georgetown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725065\"><a href=\"/opinion/725065/christopher-c-bailey-armand-berube-terryl-j-cobb-jerry-l-farr-martha-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 156-57 (4th Cir. 1996) (rejecting\r\nas \"contrary to the plain language of the FLSA and [Section 114]\"\r\nthe notion that employers and employees who have adopted a\r\nfluctuating pay plan must understand the manner in which overtime\r\npay will calculated).  The parties must only have reached a \"clear\r\nmutual understanding\" that while the employee's hours may vary, his\r\nor her base salary will not. \r\nIn short, the district court correctly applied Section\r\n114.  And, because Valerio received even more overtime payment\r\n($1,660.59) in her final paycheck than she was entitled to under\r\nSection 114, Putnam's obligation under the FLSA was extinguished\r\nand summary judgment was appropriate.  See 29 U.S.C.  216(b) (\"Any\r\nemployer who violates the provisions [of this Act] shall be liable\r\nto the employee . . . affected in the amount of [her] . . . unpaidovertime compensation[.]\") (emphasis supplied). \r\nMuch the same reasoning disposes of Valerio's claim under\r\nthe Massachusetts overtime statute.  Valerio argues that because\r\nthe Massachusetts statute has no analogue to Section 114, it\r\nrequires \"time-and-a-half\" overtime premiums be paid across-the-\r\nboard, even to employees who agreed to receive fixed salaries for\r\nfluctuating workweeks.  We do not agree.  The basic overtime\r\nprovision of the Massachusetts statute is essentially identical to\r\nthe FLSA.  Compare 29 U.S.C.  207(a)(1) with M.G.L. c. 151, 1A. \r\nMassachusetts adopted its nearly-identical statute almost twenty\r\nyears after the Supreme Court decided Overnight Motor and nearly a\r\ndecade before Overnight Motor's gloss was formally codified in\r\nSection 114.  The absence of a direct Massachusetts analogue to\r\nSection 114 is, therefore, immaterial.  To our knowledge, no\r\nMassachusetts court has even suggested the distinction Valerio\r\nseeks to advance, and, tellingly, she cites to no such case.  We\r\nconclude that both the FLSA and Massachusetts law compel the same\r\noutcomes.  Cf. Fakouri v. Pizza Hut of America, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491698\"><a href=\"/opinion/491698/farah-fakouri-and-sridhar-ramakrishnan-v-pizza-hut-of-america-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">470</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(6th Cir. 1987).  \r\nB.  The Retaliation Claim\r\nThe district court granted summary judgment for Putnam on\r\nValerio's claim for retaliatory termination, ruling that her\r\ninternal complaint on September 12, 1995 was not protected activity\r\nunder either the FLSA or Massachusetts law.  We consider the\r\nfederal law and state law issues in turn.\r\n(1) Retaliation Under the FLSA\r\nThe FLSA's anti-retaliation provision states:\r\n[I]t shall be unlawful for any person to\r\ndischarge or in any other manner discriminate\r\nagainst any employee because such employee has\r\nfiled any complaint or instituted or caused to\r\nbe instituted any proceeding under or related\r\nto this chapter, or has testified or is about\r\nto testify in any such proceeding, or has\r\nserved or is about to serve on an industry\r\ncommittee[.]\r\n\n29 U.S.C. 215(a)(3).  The question raised here is of first\r\nimpression in this Circuit: whether FLSA's prohibition on\r\nterminating an employee who \"has filed any complaint or instituted\r\nor caused to be instituted any proceeding\" under or related to the\r\nFLSA protects an employee who has lodged a written internal\r\ncomplaint with his or her employer but has not filed a judicial or\r\nadministrative complaint.  Federal courts of appeals grappling with\r\nthis issue have differed.  To date, the Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, and\r\nEleventh Circuits have held that an internal complaint to the\r\nemployer may satisfy  215(a)(3), see EEOC v.

In deciding that the\r\nFLSA's protections against retaliation are triggered only by a\r\nformal filing with a court or agency, the Second and Ninth Circuits\r\nconcluded that  215(a)(3) is unambiguous.  See Ackerly, 156 F.3d\r\nat 1024; Genesee Hospital, 10 F.3d at 55.  We do not agree.  We\r\nread the phrase \"has filed any complaint\" as susceptible to\r\ndiffering interpretations.  The word \"complaint\" itself is\r\ncertainly ambiguous.  Webster defines \"complaint\" as either \"the\r\nact or action of expressing protest, censure, or resentment:\r\nexpression of injustice ([for example] about poor housing)\" or as\r\na \"formal allegation or charge against a party made or presented to\r\nthe appropriate court or officer (as for a wrong done or a crime\r\ncommitted) and variously applied . . . \"  Webster's Third New Int'l\r\nDictionary 464 (1971).  By failing to specify that the filing of\r\nany complaint need be with a court or an agency, and by using the\r\nword \"any,\" Congress left open the possibility that it intended\r\n\"complaint\" to relate to less formal expressions of protest,\r\ncensure, resentment, or injustice conveyed to an employer.  Cf.Clean Harbors Environ. Serv., Inc. v. Herman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 &amp; n.7\r\n(1st Cir. 1998) (concluding that the phrase \"filed a complaint or\r\nbegun a proceeding\" in the anti-retaliation provision of the\r\nSurface Transportation Assistance Act, 49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(A),\r\nis ambiguous because \"the language does not say where a complaint\r\nmust be filed\").  \r\nThe strongest case for non-ambiguity rests perhaps with\r\nthe verb \"filed.\"  Had Congress spoken of \"making\" or \"voicing\" any\r\ncomplaint there would be no question it intended to include\r\nprotests as well as purely \"legal\" complaints.  Webster defines\r\n\"file\" both as \"to deliver (as a legal paper or instrument) after\r\ncomplying with any condition precedent (as the payment of a fee) to\r\nthe proper officer for keeping on file or among the records of his\r\noffice\" and \"to place (as a paper or an instrument) on file among\r\nthe legal or official records of an office esp[ecially] by formally\r\nreceiving, endorsing, and entering.\" Webster's Third New\r\nInternational Dictionary, at 849.  But while file doubtless\r\nformalizes matters, the second definition of \"file\" is sufficiently\r\nelastic to encompass an internal complaint made to a private\r\nemployer with the expectation the employer will place it on file\r\namong the employer's official records.  Compare Lundervold v.\r\nCore-Mark Int'l, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">907915</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Or. Jan. 17, 1997)\r\n(concluding that interpreting the word \"filed\" in  215 (a)(3) to\r\nrequire a written complaint \"[i]nstead of simplifying matters, . .\r\n. simply trade[s] one set of problems for another.\") \r\nFurthermore, if \"filed any complaint\" were read to\r\nencompass only filings with a court or government agency, one would\r\nwonder why the additional language \"or instituted or caused to be\r\ninstituted any proceeding under or related to this chapter\" was\r\ninserted.  The latter words become surplusage if the former means\r\nonly the filing of in-court or in-agency complaints.  See Clean\r\nHarbors, 146 F.3d at 20.  When engaged in statutory interpretation,\r\ncourts may \"assume that Congress used two terms because it intended\r\neach term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning.\"  Bailey v.\r\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146 (1995).           \r\nMoreover, the word \"any\" embraces all types of\r\ncomplaints, including those that might be filed with an employer. \r\nWe conclude, therefore, that the statute does not have a plain\r\nlanguage meaning restricted to \"legal\" complaints but rather is\r\nambiguous as to the meaning of the word \"complaint.\"  Given that\r\nambiguity, we look further to discern Congress's intent.  \r\nThe legislative history of the FLSA unfortunately\r\nprovides no real guidance as to the intended scope of  215(a)(3). \r\nWe find some assistance, however, in the broad purpose of the FLSA,\r\nas interpreted by the Supreme Court.  The FLSA has been treated as\r\nremedial in purpose.  See Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co. v. Muscoda\r\nLocal No. 123, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103958\"><a href=\"/opinion/103958/tennessee-coal-iron-r-co-v-muscoda-local-no-123/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 597 (1944).  \"For . . . practical and\r\nother reasons,\" Congress sought to secure compliance with the\r\nsubstantive provisions of the Act by having \"employees seeking to\r\nvindicate rights claimed to have been denied\" lodge complaints or\r\nsupply information to officials regarding allegedly substandard\r\nemployment practices and conditions.  Mitchell v. Robert DeMario\r\nJewelry, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105984\"><a href=\"/opinion/105984/mitchell-v-robert-demario-jewelry-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 292 (1960).  Congress recognized that\r\n\"fear of economic retaliation might often operate to induce\r\naggrieved employees quietly to accept substandard conditions.\"  Id. \r\nThe Supreme Court has stated that the FLSA \"must not be\r\ninterpreted in a narrow, grudging manner.\"  Tennessee Coal, 321\r\nU.S. at 597.  The Court also spoke of the \"remedial and\r\nhumanitarian\" purposes of the Act, id., which, as we explain infra,\r\nwould hardly be furthered by a narrow reading of  215(a)(3). \r\nUnder a construction limiting the protections of the anti-\r\nretaliation provision to the filing of judicial or agency\r\ncomplaints, an employer would be free to discharge an employee in\r\nretaliation for asserting rights under the Act, so long as the\r\nemployer acted prior to the formal filing of such a complaint or\r\nthe institution of a proceeding under the Act.  By protecting only\r\nthose employees who kept secret their belief that they were being\r\nillegally treated until they filed a legal proceeding, the Act\r\nwould discourage prior discussion of the matter between employee\r\nand employer, and would have the bizarre effect both of\r\ndiscouraging early settlement attempts and creating an incentive\r\nfor the employer to fire an employee as soon as possible after\r\nlearning the employee believed he was being treated illegally.  \r\nA narrow construction of the anti-retaliation provision\r\ncould create an atmosphere of intimidation and defeat the Act's\r\npurpose in  215(a)(3) of preventing employees' attempts to secure\r\ntheir rights under the Act from taking on the character of \"a\r\ncalculated risk.\"  Mitchell, 361 U.S. at 293.  Such circumstances\r\nwould fail to \"foster a climate in which compliance with the\r\nsubstantive provisions of the Act would be enhanced.\"  Id. at 292. \r\nHence we, like many of our sister circuits, conclude that the\r\nanimating spirit of the Act is best served by a construction of \r\n215(a)(3) under which the filing of a relevant complaint with the\r\nemployer no less than with a court or agency may give rise to a\r\nretaliation claim. \r\nOur own precedent in a closely related area supports this\r\ninterpretation.  In Clean Harbors, a panel of this Court\r\ninterpreted very similar language in the anti-retaliation provision\r\nof the Surface Transportation Assistance Act of 1982 (\"STAA\") to\r\ninclude internal employee complaints.  The STAA's anti-retaliation\r\nprovision states:\r\nA person may not discharge an employee\r\nregarding pay, terms, or privileges of\r\nemployment because the employee, or another\r\nperson at the employee's request, has filed a\r\ncomplaint or begun a proceeding related to a\r\nviolation of a commercial motor vehicle safety\r\nregulation, standard, or order, or has\r\ntestified or will testify in such a\r\nproceeding[.]\r\n\n49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(A).  The Clean Harbors panel concluded that\r\nthis language protected an employee who had filed purely\r\n\"intracorporate\" complaints about alleged violations of federal\r\ntransportation safety law.  See Clean Harbors, 146 F.3d at 14.  \r\nThe panel cited four bases for its decision.  First, the\r\nstatutory language was ambiguous, in that it did not specify where\r\na complaint must be filed.  Id. at 19 &amp; n.7.  Second, \"Congress\r\nhewed to this language when it reenacted the STAA in 1994, in the\r\nface of long-standing administrative interpretation of the STAA and\r\nsimilar language in other statutes to encompass internal complaints\r\nmade to an employer.\"  Id. at 19.  One of the cited \"other\r\nstatutes\" with \"similar language\" was the FLSA; the panel referred\r\nto the courts of appeals decisions interpreting  215(a)(3) to\r\nencompass internal complaints.  See id. at 20.  The panel also\r\ncited other decisions that interpreted analogous whistleblower\r\nprotection provisions in the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C.  1367(a),\r\nand the Federal Railway Safety Act, 45 U.S.C.  441.  Third, the\r\npanel explained that it owed deference to the Department of\r\nTransportation's interpretation under Chevron because \"in the\r\nabsence of unambiguous statutory language, this strikes us as the\r\nsort of interstitial law making which Congress left to the agency.\" \r\nClean Harbors, 146 F.3d at 19.  Fourth, the panel described the\r\nagency's policy choice to protect internal complaints to employers\r\nas \"eminently reasonable.\"  Id. \r\nPutnam contends that Clean Harbors should not guide our\r\ndecision as some of the factors animating the Clean Harborsdecision are not present here.  The factor of legislative\r\nacquiescence is not present here and, as explained previously, we\r\ndiscern no statement of agency position sufficient for deference\r\nunder the principles of Chevron.  See supra, n.5.  Putnam asserts\r\nfurther that Clean Harbors is of limited value to the present issue\r\nbecause the FLSA and the STAA have \"very different purposes and\r\nenforcement schemes\" that demand different interpretations of their\r\nrespective anti-retaliation provisions.  Putnam's argument, in\r\nessence, is that because the STAA concerns public health and\r\nsafety, it is essential that employees be encouraged to inform\r\ntheir supervisors of regulatory violations immediately so that they\r\ncan be promptly remedied; in the FLSA context, however, the need\r\nfor dispatch is diminished.  Because violations of the FLSA do not\r\npose direct and immediate threats to public safety, Putnam asserts,\r\nCongress must have intended to require FLSA complainants to avail\r\nthemselves of judicial or administrative remedies.\r\nWhile the above contentions have some force, they are not\r\nwholly persuasive.  The need for dispatch in correcting safety\r\nviolations is only one of the many objects of the STAA's anti-\r\nretaliation regime.  As the Clean Harbors panel explained, forcing\r\nemployees with safety concerns to go straight to the government\r\nwould deny the company an opportunity to \"remedy its own problems\r\nvoluntarily and quietly.\"  Id. at 21.  Internal complaints may be\r\nseen as benefitting not only the employee, but the employer as\r\nwell.  Id. See also id. at 19 (recognizing the value of \"leveraging\r\nthe government's limited enforcement resources\").  Finally, and\r\nperhaps most importantly, the Clean Harbors court noted the value\r\nof protecting employees \"who in good faith assert safety concerns\r\nto their employers, or who indicate an unwillingness to engage in\r\nsuch violations\" by \"casting a broad net in the [field of] anti-\r\nretaliation provisions.\"  Id. at 21.  The Clean Harbors panel\r\nrecognized, as we do supra, that \"fear of economic retaliation\r\nmight operate to induce aggrieved employees to accept substandard\r\nconditions.\"  Mitchell, 361 U.S. at 292.  In sum, many of the\r\nanimating policies cited by the Clean Harbors panel apply with\r\nequal force to violations of the FLSA.  \r\nWe hold, therefore, that the FLSA's anti-retaliation\r\nprovision will protect an employee who has filed a sufficient\r\ncomplaint with an employer.  \r\nOf course, not all abstract grumblings will suffice to\r\nconstitute the filing of a complaint with one's employer.  As the\r\nClean Harbors panel acknowledged, affording protection to employees\r\nwho lodge purely intracorporate complaints \"unhelpfully leaves\r\nemployers in the dark\" as to what types of assertions will rise to\r\nthe level of protected activity by their employees.  Clean Harbors,\r\n146 F.3d at 21.  We agree that \"[t]here is a point at which an\r\nemployee's concerns and comments are too generalized and informal\r\nto constitute 'complaints' that are 'filed' with an employer within\r\nthe meaning of the [statute.]\" Id. at 22.  Even putting oral\r\ncomplaints aside, as we do in this case, see note 4, supra, written\r\ncomments and criticisms made to an employer may not always amount\r\nto filed complaints \"under or related to this chapter.\"  29 U.S.C.\r\n215(a)(3).  We conclude, as did the panel in Clean Harbors, that\r\nwe have little choice but to proceed on a case-by-case basis,\r\naddressing as a matter of factual analysis whether the internal\r\ncommunications to the employer were sufficient to amount to the\r\n\"filing of any complaint\" within the statutory definition.\r\nHere, we conclude that Valerio's September 12, 1995\r\nletter was sufficiently definite to notify Putnam that she was\r\nasserting her statutory rights to overtime pay.  She wrote to Lisa\r\nPatterson, who was her direct supervisor and Putnam's Office\r\nManager, that, at least as long as she was required to be a\r\nreceptionist, she was misclassified as exempt under the FLSA, and\r\nwas entitled to overtime pay.  While Valerio seems also to have\r\nindicated a preference to remain as a Research Associate and\r\nperhaps therefore an exempt employee (foregoing the receptionist\r\nlabel), she stated she was \"considering complaint options and have\r\ncontacted the Department of Labor.\"  She quoted the  relevant\r\nstatutory language regarding her claim and threatened legal action\r\nif retaliation took place. \r\nPutnam insists that the letter should be read not as a\r\ncomplaint itself, but merely a negotiating tool, with the\r\npossibility of a complaint to the Department of Labor to follow if\r\nValerio's demands were not met.  Putnam emphasizes that the letter\r\nconcludes with a statement in the conditional form: \"If you retract\r\nyour letter and abide by the terms of my employment agreement, I\r\nwill walk away from these issues with our professional relationship\r\nintact.\"  \r\nWe disagree with Putnam's argument for several reasons. \r\nFirst, it presupposes that a \"complaint\" under the FLSA must be\r\nfiled with the administrative agency, a notion which, as explained\r\npreviously, we reject.  Second, it overlooks the very explicit\r\nreferences to the FLSA and Valerio's stated intention to pursue\r\nremedies under the Act if Putnam failed to meet her concerns.  SeeClean Harbors, 146 F.3d at 21.  Other courts have classified as\r\n\"complaints\" statements far less definite than those here.  SeeRomeo Community Schools, 976 F.2d at 989 (plaintiff who told school\r\ndistrict that she believed they were \"breaking some sort of law\" by\r\npaying her lower wages than previously paid to male employees had\r\n\"filed any complaint\" under the FLSA); White &amp; Son Enterprises, 881\r\nF.2d at 1007-08 (female employees who met with company owner and\r\nforeman and asked for equal pay had \"filed any complaint\").  Third,\r\nwhile the letter ends with an olive branch, its tone and overall\r\ncontent could not have left Putnam with any doubt that Valerio was\r\ncomplaining that she was mis-classified and was asserting her right\r\nto overtime pay, unless, at least, Putnam was prepared to\r\nreclassify her in accordance with her wishes.  Putnam never did so\r\n-- and it now concedes Valerio was all along entitled to overtime\r\npay.  We do not think it lies in Putnam's mouth to claim the\r\nbenefit of a condition it at all times rejected.  We, therefore,\r\nreject Putnam's contention that Valerio's letter was not a\r\nprotected complaint but merely some form of unprotected negotiating\r\ntool. \r\n(2) Retaliation Under Massachusetts Law\r\nWe must also consider how our explication of the FLSA\r\nrequirements affects Valerio's retaliation claim under\r\nMassachusetts law, as she had alleged that \"[a]nalogous protections\r\nexist under state law.\"  See Complaint,  23.  The district court\r\ndismissed this claim, ruling that Massachusetts does not appear to\r\nrecognize a common law cause of action where the relevant public\r\npolicy has already been vindicated by a state or federal statute. \r\nWe agree, relying principally upon the decision of the\r\nMassachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") in Melley v. Gillette\r\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 1986).  \r\nIn Melley, the SJC was asked to decide whether a\r\nplaintiff who had failed to follow the procedures set forth in\r\nMassachusetts' employment discrimination statute, M.G.L. c. 151B,\r\ncould nevertheless bring an age discrimination claim based on a\r\ncommon law theory of wrongful termination.  The SJC adopted the\r\nanalysis and conclusion of the intermediate appellate court, which\r\nhad reasoned: \"[t]he rationale for implying a private remedy under\r\nthe 'public policy exception' to the traditional rule governing at-\r\nwill employment contracts is that, unless a remedy is recognized,\r\nthere is no other way to vindicate such a public policy.\"  Melleyv. Gillette Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1277</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1228 (Mass. App. 1985)\r\n(citations omitted).  The intermediate court concluded that \"where,\r\nas here, there is a comprehensive remedial statute, the creation of\r\na new common law action based on the public policy expressed in\r\nthat statute would interfere with that remedial scheme.\"  Id. at\r\n1229.\r\nTo be sure, Melley did not address the precise issue\r\npresented here, as it involved the effect of a comprehensive state\r\nstatute in the field, as opposed to a federal one.  However, were\r\nthe SJC faced with the present situation, we do not believe that\r\nthe federal nature of the statutory remedy would make a\r\ndifference.  Cf. Grubba v. Bay State Abrasives, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"478359\"><a href=\"/opinion/478359/donald-c-grubba-v-bay-state-abrasives-division-of-dresser-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">803</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 747\r\n&amp; n.1 (1st Cir. 1986)(assuming, without deciding, that Massachusetts\r\nwould not recognize a claim for breach of the implied covenant of\r\ngood faith and fair dealing if the public policy was already\r\nvindicated by the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973); compare,\r\ne.g., Conner v.

We vacate, however, the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment in Putnam's favor on Valerio's claim for retaliation under\r\nthe FLSA, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion.
