The     Federal     Aviation\n\nAdministration     (\"FAA\")    authorized      Shuttle      America    Airlines\n\n(\"Shuttle America\") to provide scheduled passenger service to\n\nNew York's LaGuardia Airport (\"LaGuardia\") from Hanscom Field\n\n(\"Hanscom\"), a general aviation airport that lies 15 miles\n\nnorthwest of Boston abutting the towns of Bedford, Concord,\n\nLexington, and Lincoln.           The petitioners--two preservationist\n\norganizations,     three     of    the     four   towns    (Bedford    is    an\n\nintervenor), and stewards of several nearby historic sites--seek\n\nreview of the FAA decision on the ground that the agency did not\n\nadequately consider the adverse effect of the additional Shuttle\n\nAmerica flights on historic and natural resources near Hanscom.\n\n          Hanscom has been a major aviation facility since 1940,\n\nwhen the Commonwealth of Massachusetts first acquired the site\n\nto   accommodate    the    U.S.     Army    Air   Corps.      In     1973   the\n\nMassachusetts Port Authority (\"MassPort\") converted a portion of\n\nthe site into a general aviation facility serving corporate\n\naviation, flight schools, air charter operations, light cargo,\n\nand private business and recreational flights.                (The U.S. Air\n\nForce uses the remainder as Hanscom Air Force Base.)                  In 1995,\n\nthere were about 95,000 general aviation and military flights\n\n(defined as a departure and an arrival) at Hanscom.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f           In recent years, MassPort and the FAA have expanded\n\ncommercial    passenger     service    at    Hanscom,    seeking    to    lessen\n\ncongestion at Boston's Logan International Airport.                These steps\n\nhave concerned community groups who fear that the increased\n\nnoise, air pollution, and surface traffic from the additional\n\nflights    will    harm   the   natural     and   historic   resources      near\n\nHanscom.    These sites include Minute Man National Historic Park,\n\nWalden Pond, and the homes of eminent American authors such as\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson and Louisa May Alcott.              The main access road\n\nto Hanscom is a part of Route 2A, which runs through the heart\n\nof Minute Man National Park.\n\n           In July 1999, MassPort backed a plan to let Shuttle\n\nAmerica--a    commuter     airline    then    operating      out   of    several\n\nairports on the East Coast--provide scheduled passenger service\n\nat Hanscom.       To this end, Shuttle America asked the FAA to add\n\nHanscom to the list of airport destinations in its operating\n\nspecifications.       MassPort asked the FAA to upgrade Hanscom's\n\noperating certificate to a \"full Part 139 certificate,\" which\n\nallows use of planes with greater than 30 seats.               See generally\n\n14 C.F.R. Part 139 (2000).\n\n           The FAA granted both requests in September 1999, and\n\nShuttle America immediately commenced passenger service out of\n\nHanscom, with four daily round-trip flights.             The FAA determined\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthat it did not need to perform an environmental analysis for\n\nthe two approvals because they were categorically excluded from\n\nreview under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969\n\n(\"NEPA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 4321 et seq. (1994).         It also concluded\n\nthat the categorical exclusion under NEPA obviated the need for\n\nconsultation   under   Section   106   of    the   National   Historic\n\nPreservation Act of 1966 (\"NHPA\"), 16 U.S.C. § 470f (1994).\n\n         The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which\n\nis authorized to enforce NHPA, see 16 U.S.C. § 470s, questioned\n\nthe FAA's reading of NHPA, and petitioner Save Our Heritage\n\nunsuccessfully sought reconsideration and rehearing of both the\n\nPart 139 certification and the addition of Hanscom to Shuttle\n\nAmerica's operating specifications.         However, no party sought\n\ntimely judicial review of either of the FAA's decisions; such\n\nreview is now time-barred.   49 U.S.C. § 46110(a) (1994).1\n\n         In May 2000, Shuttle America applied for the operating\n\nspecifications amendment at issue in this case--an amendment to\n\nadd LaGuardia to its list of approved airport destinations.         It\n\nproposed to make seven round-trip flights between Hanscom and\n\nLaGuardia, with the possibility of eventually expanding the\n\n\n    1The four Hanscom-area towns unsuccessfully sued in\nMassachusetts state court to enjoin MassPort's application on\nthe ground that it violated promises made in MassPort's 1978\nHanscom Master Plan.   Hanscom Area Towns Comm. v. Mass. Port\nAuth., CIV No. 99-04461-F (Mass. Sup. Ct. 1999).\n\n                                 -5-\n\fservice to ten flights a day.            The FAA expressed doubt that NHPA\n\nconsultation    was    required,         but     in    light   of   the   Advisory\n\nCouncil's earlier concerns, it decided it would be \"prudent\" to\n\nconsult     provisionally         with     the        Massachusetts     Historical\n\nCommission, which the Commonwealth had designated as its NHPA\n\nconsulting agency.         After conducting an environmental analysis,\n\nthe   FAA   proposed   a    finding      that    the     additional   flights     to\n\nLaGuardia would have no potential adverse effect on historic\n\nproperties.\n\n            Petitioners Save Our Heritage and the Hanscom-area\n\ntowns sent the FAA detailed criticisms of its proposed finding,\n\nand the Massachusetts Historical Commission also refused to\n\nconcur.       After    providing         additional       documentation     in    an\n\nunsuccessful    effort       to    persuade       the     Commission,     the    FAA\n\nterminated the consultation and, on October 27, 2000, issued the\n\namendment (\"the LaGuardia amendment\").                    Shuttle America began\n\ncommercial service from Hanscom to LaGuardia with five round-\n\ntrip flights per day, later reaching a peak of seven daily\n\nround-trip flights in January 2001.2\n\n\n\n\n      2\n     Since that time, Shuttle America has entered into Chapter\n11 reorganization proceedings, but it continues to maintain one\nLaGuardia flight daily and has stated that it hopes eventually\nto reinstate its previous level of service.\n\n                                         -6-\n\f             On direct review, 49 U.S.C. § 46110(a), petitioners now\n\nask us to set aside and enjoin the LaGuardia amendment on the\n\ngrounds the FAA decision violated NEPA, NHPA, and Section 4(f)\n\nof the Department of Transportation Act of 1966, 49 U.S.C. §\n\n303(c)    (1994)   (originally   codified   at    49   U.S.C.   §   1653(f)\n\n(1970)).     The statutory requirements are described below.            The\n\ngist of the FAA's position is that its \"effects\" determination--\n\nthat the addition of seven to ten flights a day would have no\n\nsignificant environmental impact--exempted the amendment from or\n\notherwise satisfied these requirements.\n\n             At the threshold, the FAA and supporting intervenors\n\nraise two objections to our consideration of the case.                  The\n\nfirst is that the petitioners lack Article III standing, and the\n\nsecond is that the petitions are effectively out-of-time attacks\n\non   prior    agency   orders.    Because   the    first   challenge     is\n\nconstitutional, we start with it.\n\n             The basic requirements for Article III standing are\n\nthat the petitioner is someone who has suffered or is threatened\n\nby injury in fact to a cognizable interest, that the injury is\n\ncausally connected to the defendant's action, and that it can be\n\nabated by a remedy the court is competent to give. 3                   What\n\n\n      3\n     Cotter v. Mass. Ass'n of Minority Law Enforcement Officers,\n219 F.3d 31, 33 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1072\n(2001); Town of Norwood, Mass. v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm'n, 202\n\n                                  -7-\n\fconstitutes a \"cognizable interest\" can present vexing problems,\n\nsee Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction § 2.3, at 68-74 (3d ed.\n\n1999), but here the FAA and supporting intervenors concede that\n\naesthetic and environmental injury are cognizable, see Sierra\n\nClub v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 734 (1972).\n\n           Rather, the objections to standing are threefold.                The\n\nfirst, and least persuasive, is the suggestion that even if some\n\nindividuals    or   organizations     are   adversely     affected     by   the\n\nincreased flights, none of the petitioners or identified members\n\nof petitioner organizations have shown that they are among those\n\ninjured.      Admittedly,   a   specified     petitioner    or   identified\n\nmember must be within the affected group.               See Friends of the\n\nEarth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt'l Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181-84\n\n(2000).\n\n           Here, the petitioners comprise nonprofit environmental\n\nor preservationist associations such as Save Our Heritage; the\n\ntowns located near Hanscom; and at least two petitioners that\n\nown nearby historic sites:      the Walden Woods Project, which owns\n\npart of the Walden Woods site and operates a Thoreau research\n\nand   educational   facility    on   it;    and   the   Louisa   May   Alcott\n\nMemorial Association, which manages the writer's home.                  It is\n\nsufficient for the case to proceed if at least one petitioner\n\n\nF.3d 392, 405-06 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 818 (2000).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fhas standing, Wash. Legal Found. v. Mass. Bar Found., 993 F.2d\n\n962, 971-72 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n          There is little reason to doubt that the two nonprofit\n\nlandowners (Walden Woods Project and the Alcott Association)\n\nwould be affected by both noise and air pollution, given their\n\nfunction and proximity to Hanscom; and it is likely, although\n\nunnecessary to decide, that the three towns themselves would\n\nhave a direct interest, e.g., in traffic congestion.4             We need\n\nnot resolve whether the petitioner associations have established\n\nstanding based on the rather sparse allegations of injury to the\n\ninterests of their individual members.        See Int'l Union, United\n\nAuto., Aero. & Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477\n\nU.S. 274, 281-82 (1986).\n\n          Next,   the    FAA   says   that   there   is    no   actual   or\n\nthreatened adverse effect on any petitioner because, according\n\nto the FAA's findings, the small number of additional flights\n\nwill have no significant environmental impact.            At first blush,\n\nthis appears to be a question of the merits rather than one of\n\nstanding; the petitioners certainly allege substantial effects\n\nand   challenge   both   the    FAA's   contrary     findings    and     the\n\nprocedures used to reach them.\n\n\n      4\n     Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 572 n.7\n(1992); Douglas County v. Babbitt, 48 F.3d 1495, 1501 (9th Cir.\n1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1042 (1996).\n\n                                  -9-\n\f         We need not rule out the possibility of cases where the\n\nclaim of impact is so specious or patently implausible that a\n\nthreshold standing objection might be appropriate.     See, e.g.,\n\nTown of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 406; Florida Audubon Soc'y v.\n\nBentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 669 (D.C. Cir. 1996).    But beyond that, we\n\nthink that the likelihood and extent of impact are properly\n\naddressed in connection with the merits and issues of harmless\n\nerror.   Breyer & Stewart,   Administrative Law and Regulatory\n\nPolicy 1107 (2d ed. 1985); cf. Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 681-\n\n84 (1946).    A reasonable claim of minimal impact is enough for\n\nstanding even though it may not trigger agency obligations.\n\n         Third, the FAA points out that the order here under\n\nreview did not increase the number of flights that Shuttle\n\nAmerica is authorized to operate at Hanscom.   Given prior orders\n\nthat are now beyond review, Shuttle America was and is entitled\n\nto fly an unlimited number of flights to its other, already-\n\napproved airports regardless of the outcome of this case.   Thus,\n\nsays the FAA, the order permitting flights to LaGuardia cannot\n\nbe the cause of the alleged injury to petitioners, because it\n\ncould fly the same number of flights even if the order were\n\noverturned.\n\n         If the same number of flights carrying the same number\n\nof passengers would be flown regardless of the present order,\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fthe order would hardly be the but-for cause of any impact due to\n\nmore flights or ground traffic.             But as a matter of common\n\nsense, Shuttle America likely sought authorization for LaGuardia\n\nbecause it would generate some additional traffic over and above\n\nits existing demand.      Shuttle America has not shown or offered\n\nto show that the number of flights and the amount of car traffic\n\nwould be identical even without the authorization.            Petitioners\n\nasserting standing are not required to negate every possibility\n\nthat   the    outcome   might   be   the    same   under   highly   unusual\n\ncircumstances.\n\n             The FAA makes a separate and quite different threshold\n\nobjection.      It says that petitioners are making out-of-time\n\nattacks on prior orders.        It points out that the statute imposes\n\na 60-day limit on direct review, 49 U.S.C. § 46110(a), and, no\n\npetition for review having been filed within that time, it\n\nargues that it is not open to petitioners now to challenge the\n\norders entered in September 1999 allowing Shuttle America to\n\noperate from Hanscom and Hanscom to handle commercial flights\n\nusing larger planes.\n\n             No doubt much of the impact on nearby natural and\n\nhistoric sites, assuming the allegations are true, stems from\n\nthese earlier orders and not from the authorization to add a\n\nlimited number of flights to LaGuardia.                Nevertheless, the\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fpetitioners are entitled to claim that an additional impact will\n\nbe felt from the now-authorized LaGuardia flights, over and\n\nabove the effects of the prior orders.                    Whether or not the\n\nplausible    added      effects    are     so   slight    as    to     justify      the\n\nshortcuts    taken      by   the   FAA    is    a   merits     issue    yet    to   be\n\naddressed; but it does not make an attack on this alleged\n\nincremental impact an attack on the wrong order.\n\n            Only   to    the   extent     that      petitioners      are   actually\n\nseeking redress from the effects of the present orders are their\n\npetitions timely, and this limitation must be borne in mind in\n\nconsidering the arguments.           Admittedly, there is some language\n\nin the briefs that appears to attack the earlier orders because\n\nof alleged infirmities in its findings or procedures.                         But the\n\npossibility that some of the petitioners' arguments are time-\n\nbarred does not defeat those actually directed to the more\n\nrecent order.\n\n            This brings us to the merits.             Although the claims can\n\nbe segmented in several ways, the underlying issues basically\n\nreduce themselves to two: whether the FAA erred substantively in\n\nconcluding that the additional flights--up to ten new round\n\ntrips a day--would have a de minimis environmental impact and\n\nwhether, regardless of impact, the FAA erred procedurally in\n\nfailing to consult further with governmental agencies concerned\n\n\n                                         -12-\n\fwith historic preservation.             We begin with the \"substantive\"\n\nissue which arises, in slightly different frameworks, under\n\nthree different statutes.\n\n            The most familiar is NEPA, which requires agencies to\n\ndevelop a detailed environmental impact statement (an \"EIS\")\n\nbefore     undertaking      \"major      Federal    actions       significantly\n\naffecting the quality of the human environment.\"                  42 U.S.C. §\n\n4332(2)(C).      The NEPA regulations permit agencies to conduct a\n\nless demanding \"environmental assessment\" to determine whether\n\nan   EIS   is   required;    if   not,    the   agency    must    explain   its\n\ndetermination in a \"finding of no significant impact.\"                      40\n\nC.F.R. §§ 1501.4 (2000).\n\n            In a regulation whose validity is not in dispute, the\n\nFAA effectively concedes that the LaGuardia amendment qualifies\n\nas a major federal action.              Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation\n\nAdmin. Order 1050.1D, \"Policies and Procedures for Considering\n\nEnvironmental Impacts,\" App. 4, ¶ 3(e).5            However, a categorical\n\nexclusion excuses the FAA from preparing either an EIS or an\n\nenvironmental     assessment      for    \"operating      specifications     and\n\namendments      thereto   which    do    not    significantly      change   the\n\n\n      5\n      FAA Order 1050.1D, which was in effect at the time of the\nLaGuardia amendment, is the FAA's formal rule for implementing\nall three statutes implicated in this case. 49 Fed. Reg. 28,501\n(July 12, 1984).    A proposed revision to the order is not\nrelevant here. See 64 Fed. Reg. 55,526 (Oct. 19, 1999).\n\n                                     -13-\n\foperating environment of the airport.\"              FAA 1050.1D, App. 4, ¶\n\n4(h).\n\n              This exclusion is itself qualified by an \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\"          provision      which     requires     at        least   an\n\nenvironmental assessment for an otherwise excluded action if the\n\naction is, inter alia, \"likely to have an effect that is not\n\nminimal on properties protected under Section 106 of [NHPA] or\n\nSection 4(f) [of the Transportation Act of 1966],\" or \"likely to\n\nbe highly controversial on environmental grounds.\"                      FAA Order\n\n1050.1D, ¶ 32.        Petitioners rely on both of these exceptions and\n\nargue that the additional flights have more than minimal effects\n\nand were highly controversial.\n\n              NHPA and Section 4(f) impose different requirements\n\nthan NEPA, in the service of somewhat more focused interests;\n\nbut     the    requirements      of    concern   here--with       one    possible\n\nqualification regarding an obligation to consult--both turn (as\n\nwith    NEPA)    on   whether    the   agency    action   poses    a    plausible\n\nenvironmental threat.           A brief description of the two statutes\n\nmakes this clear.\n\n              NHPA, heavily relied on by petitioners, is designed to\n\nprotect       certain    \"historic     properties,\"       which    indisputably\n\ninclude sites near Hanscom.            Section 106 of the statute requires\n\nthat prior to a proposed federal \"undertaking,\" the agency must\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\f\"take into account the effect\" on such properties and allow the\n\nAdvisory    Council     on     Historic        Preservation            a     \"reasonable\n\nopportunity to comment.\"                16 U.S.C. § 470f.                  The act thus\n\nimposes    both   a   substantive        obligation          to    weigh     effects     in\n\ndeciding    whether     to     authorize        the        federal     action     and     a\n\nprocedural obligation to consult.               See generally 36 C.F.R. Part\n\n800 (2000).\n\n            The   grant      of     a    permit       such        as   the     LaGuardia\n\nauthorization can certainly qualify as an undertaking.                                   16\n\nU.S.C. § 470w(7)(C); 36 C.F.R. § 800.16(y) (2000);                             see also\n\nSugarloaf Citizens Ass'n v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm'n, 959 F.2d\n\n508, 515 (4th Cir. 1992).               But even if the approval of the\n\nLaGuardia     flights     is      assumed      to     be    an     undertaking,         the\n\nsubstantive obligation to \"take into account the effect\" of the\n\nflights on historic properties is beside the point if there is\n\nno   potential    adverse      effect.      See       36    C.F.R.     §     800.3(a)(1)\n\n(2000).    To that extent, the question under NEPA and under NHPA\n\nis the same: whether the FAA erred in finding that any impact of\n\nthe newly authorized flights on the surrounding area was                                 de\n\nminimis.\n\n            The last of the three statutes--Section 4(f) of the\n\nDepartment of Transportation Act--is even more stringent where\n\nit applies.       It protects certain public parks and historic\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fsites, again indisputably including some near Hanscom, from any\n\n\"transportation program or project\" requiring the \"use\" of such\n\npark or land, unless certain quite restrictive tests have been\n\nmet.     To proceed in the teeth of such a \"use,\" the agency must\n\nfind that there is no feasible alternative to using that land\n\nand that the program or project includes all possible planning\n\nto minimize harm.       49 U.S.C. § 303(c).\n\n            At first blush, one might think that Section 4(f) could\n\nhave    nothing    to   do   with    authorizing      new    flights      from   an\n\nexisting, physically unaltered airport; but the statute has been\n\nread to apply not only to a physical use or occupancy of\n\nprotected parks or land but also to activities that will have a\n\nserious indirect impact on the protected park or land--a so-\n\ncalled    \"constructive      use.\"     23    C.F.R.    §    771.135(p)(1)(iii)\n\n(2000); Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. Fed. Aviation Admin.,\n\n161 F.3d 569, 583 (9th Cir. 1998).                 Once again, the FAA's\n\nfinding that the LaGuardia flights would have only a de minimis\n\neffect would avoid the statute if the finding were to be upheld.\n\nAdler v. Lewis, 675 F.2d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir. 1982).\n\n            What, then, underpins the FAA's finding of de minimis\n\nimpact in this case?         The starting point is that independent of\n\nthe    LaGuardia   flights,     Hanscom      handled       just   under   100,000\n\nflights in 1999, and the disputed LaGuardia flights would add,\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fat a maximum, ten more flights per day.              The more realistic\n\nestimate of seven flights, according to the FAA, would produce\n\nan annual increase in Hanscom flights of about 2.5 percent--a\n\nnumber that absent special circumstances would approach the\n\ntrivial.\n\n           This figure might at first appear to understate the\n\npotential environmental effect because most existing Hanscom\n\nflights are private aircraft, which are somewhat smaller and\n\ncarry   fewer   passengers    than    even   the   modest      50   passenger\n\nturboprop planes used by Shuttle America.            On the other hand,\n\nsome of the resulting ground traffic occurs in non-peak periods\n\nwhere   existing   levels    are   light,    and   the   new    flights   use\n\nturboprop aircraft considerably quieter than the corporate jets\n\nand other civilian aircraft currently using the airport.                Thus,\n\ncertain effects of the additional flights may be less than the\n\nalready small percentage increase in the number of flights.\n\n           But we need not rely on such inferences because here\n\nthe FAA directly studied the three types of potential effects\n\nfrom the additional flights: noise, fuel emissions, and surface\n\ntraffic from passenger travel to and from the airport.                     As\n\nbackground for considering the effects, the FAA extrapolated\n\nfrom MassPort's 1995 Generic Environmental Impact Report (\"the\n\nGEIR\"),    actually   completed      in   1997,    which    projected     and\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fextensively assessed the noise, emissions, and traffic effects\n\nof future Hanscom operations under zero, modest, and robust\n\ngrowth scenarios for commercial aviation.                    It also relied on a\n\nsurface traffic study performed in 2000 for the adjacent Hanscom\n\nAir Force Base.\n\n              The FAA summarized its findings in two letters (on\n\nSeptember 15, 2000 and October 6, 2000) to the Massachusetts\n\nHistorical Commission.            The FAA first compared the actual number\n\nof flights in 1999 (prior to the LaGuardia authorization) with\n\nthe GEIR's 1999 projections under the modest growth scenario,\n\nand    found       that    the     GEIR's     forecast       was     nearly    exact\n\n(approximately          99,000    flights).         This    both    confirmed    the\n\naccuracy      of    the    GEIR    and,     since    the     GEIR    indicated    no\n\nsignificant        environmental      concerns      under    the    modest    growth\n\nscenario, showed that pre-amendment baseline conditions were\n\nacceptable.\n\n              The FAA then conducted its own studies, which found\n\nthat    the   additional        LaGuardia    flights       would    not   exacerbate\n\nenvironmental conditions.            As to noise, the FAA found that the\n\nadditional flights would have a 1 percent or less increase in\n\nthe    65   DNL    dB   noise    contour,    which    indicates       noise   levels\n\ncompatible with all land uses, see 14 C.F.R. Part 150, App. A,\n\nTbl. 1 (2001), under a test in which a 17 percent increase is\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\fdeemed significant.     It also found that the 65 DNL dB noise\n\ncontour would continue to remain \"almost completely on airport\n\nproperty\" and that most of Minute Man National Park and Walden\n\nWoods would fall outside the 55 DNL dB line.6     It thus concluded\n\nthat the area around Hanscom \"should not experience appreciable\n\nincreases in aircraft noise or overflights\" as a result of the\n\nadded air traffic.\n\n          For air quality effects, the FAA used a model that took\n\naccount of emissions both from aircraft (accounting for factors\n\nsuch as equipment type and including take-off, taxi, and idling\n\ntime) and surface vehicles (both passenger traffic and ground\n\nsupport   equipment).   The   FAA   concluded   that   the   potential\n\nemissions associated with the LaGuardia flights were \"below de\n\nminimis levels\" as to both of the two critical ozone-producing\n\npollutants and that the new flights would not undercut the\n\nstate's implementation plan for air quality.\n\n          As for surface traffic, the FAA found that none of the\n\nflights would affect peak morning traffic and only one would\n\naffect peak evening traffic.    Estimating that each flight would\n\ngenerate 70 additional vehicle trips, it concluded that, at\n\n\n\n    6These noise contour lines demarcate the land area enclosed\nwithin a particular level of noise, measured in \"day-night\naverage sound level\" (\"DNL\") units, which represent the average\ndecibel level at a particular location over a 24-hour period.\n\n                               -19-\n\fworst, the peak evening flight would increase traffic at several\n\nintersections on Route 2A by only about 2.65 percent, which the\n\nFAA deemed minimal and within the GEIR projection already found\n\nto be tolerable.        As for noise increase, it found that the\n\nincreased traffic volume would raise the peak level by less than\n\n0.3 dB, \"which is not a perceptible increase.\"            See 23 C.F.R. §\n\n771.135(p)(5)(iii) (2001).\n\n            Remarkably, in their lengthy submissions, petitioners\n\nmake no direct attack on the aircraft noise or air pollution\n\nconclusions.      Petitioners say only that any reliance on the GEIR\n\nwas \"inappropriate\" because it was prepared for \"unrelated\"\n\noperations and is out of date.          But in fact, the FAA verified\n\nthe GEIR's accuracy by finding that the actual growth at Hanscom\n\nas   of   1999    coincided   almost   exactly   with   the   GEIR    \"modest\n\ngrowth\" scenario whose environmental effects had already been\n\nconsidered.\n\n            The FAA's surface traffic analysis gets more attention,\n\nbut even here their discussion is limited to a few pages and is\n\nconfined to three brands of criticism: highly general claims\n\nthat the agency's analysis is inadequate (e.g., that the FAA\n\nshould     have     discussed    non-peak   hour    traffic      or    other\n\nintersections); criticisms of the agency's factual assumptions\n\n(e.g., that the FAA underestimated the number of vehicle trips\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fthat each passenger would take); or abstract statements of\n\ndisagreement by other entities (e.g., claims by the National\n\nPark   Service        that   increased     traffic       would   have   \"serious\n\ndetrimental impacts\").\n\n            Under settled doctrine, the FAA's factual findings are\n\nconclusive if supported by substantial evidence, 49 U.S.C. §\n\n46110(c), and its reasoning is tested for reasonableness under\n\nan arbitrary and capricious standard.                    5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A);\n\nPenobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 164 F.3d\n\n713, 718-20 (1st Cir. 1999).              Further, it is up to those who\n\nassail its findings or reasoning to identify the defects in\n\nevidence and the faults in reasoning.               Lomak Petroleum, Inc. v.\n\nFed. Energy Reg. Comm'n, 206 F.3d 1193, 1198 (D.C. Cir. 2000).\n\n\n\n            Where the agency is dealing with a very complicated and\n\ntechnical subject, this takes a lot of work by lawyers in\n\nculling   the    record      and   organizing      the    information    for   the\n\nreviewing court, but it can be done.                     Here, the FAA's final\n\nassessment--that a tiny percentage increase in flights would\n\nhave a    de minimis effect--is presumptively inviting but, in\n\nprinciple,      can    be    overcome    by    a   sustained     and    organized\n\nrebuttal.       Nothing offered by petitioners approaches such an\n\neffort.   Gauzy generalizations and pin-prick criticisms, in the\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fface of specific findings and a plausible result, are not even\n\na start at a serious assault.\n\n            There is one obvious concern, and it is not about the\n\nimpact of    this extremely modest increase in Shuttle America\n\nflights.    Conceivably, Shuttle America or another airline could\n\nappear with a succession of new-destination proposals, each\n\nmodest in size and in impact; and yet the cumulative effect of\n\nthe FAA approvals could be major even though no one approval was\n\nsignificant in itself.        Either a clear plan for such successive\n\nsteps or proof that such a succession was foreseeable could\n\nconceivably    require   an   overall     prospective   assessment.   40\n\nC.F.R. §§ 1508.4, 1508.27(b)(7) (2000).\n\n            But we are not faced with any such developed claim in\n\nthis case, nor do the known facts suggest any such thing.             At\n\nthe time of Shuttle America's application, commercial service at\n\nHanscom had been a repeated failure, and there was no reason to\n\nbelieve, at that point, that demand would dramatically increase.\n\nNow, Shuttle America has reduced its operations and is under the\n\nprotection of the bankruptcy court.         If Shuttle America or other\n\nairlines undertake a series of proposed expansions, it will be\n\ntime enough to consider whether new and projected activities\n\nneed to be considered together.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f             Petitioners         say    that     even   if    the    minimal      effects\n\nfinding stands, the FAA's own regulations still required at\n\nleast   an    environmental            assessment       under    NEPA       because     the\n\nproposed     action       was    \"highly    controversial           on     environmental\n\ngrounds.\"         FAA Order 1050.1D ¶ 32(b).              The FAA's regulations,\n\nread literally, indicate that this test is met if the \"action\"\n\nin question is \"opposed on environmental grounds by a Federal,\n\nState, or local government agency or by a substantial number of\n\nthe persons affected.\"             FAA Order 1050.1D, ¶ 17.                 Although the\n\nfederal and state agencies did not formally oppose the LaGuardia\n\nflights    (instead        simply       asking    for    more    study),         the   four\n\nadjoining towns flatly opposed the new flights.\n\n             Citing a number of cases, the FAA argues that whether\n\na project is environmentally controversial does not depend on\n\nwhether      vocal       opponents      exist     but    on     whether       reasonable\n\ndisagreement         exists      over     the     project's         risk    of    causing\n\nenvironmental harm.             See, e.g., Found. for N. Am. Wild Sheep v.\n\nU.S. Dep't of Agric., 681 F.2d 1172, 1182 (9th Cir. 1982).\n\nOtherwise, says the FAA, projects could be bogged down by a\n\n\"heckler's veto\" despite the lack of a genuine environmental\n\nthreat.      The FAA says that its own assessment here that the\n\nproject      is    not    objectively          controversial         is    entitled      to\n\ndeference.\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\f            The FAA's approach certainly makes sense on policy\n\ngrounds, but it is in some tension with the wording of its own\n\nregulation, which seems to make official opposition to the\n\nproposed \"action\" the trigger.            By contrast, the decisions on\n\nwhich the FAA relies interpret \"controversial\" as used in other\n\nregulations, where the term modifies \"effects\"--phrasing more\n\nhelpful to the FAA's reading.            See, e.g., id. (interpreting 40\n\nC.F.R. § 1508.27(b)(4)).\n\n            We need not decide whether the latitude allowed to the\n\nagency in interpreting its own regulations, see Thomas Jefferson\n\nUniv. v.      Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994), stretches to a\n\nreading that may make policy sense but appears at odds with the\n\nlanguage.      (Certainly the FAA might wish expressly to clarify\n\nits language for future cases.)           Rather, we think that even if\n\nthe \"controversial\" action regulation is read in petitioners'\n\nfavor,   it    makes   no   sense   to    remand   for   an   environmental\n\nassessment where, as here, the FAA has already made a reasoned\n\nfinding that the environmental effects are de minimis.                In a\n\nnutshell, the failure to make a more formal assessment was\n\nharmless error.\n\n            The doctrine of harmless error is as much a part of\n\njudicial review of administrative action as of appellate review\n\nof trial court judgments.       Indeed, the Administrative Procedure\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fAct, 5 U.S.C. § 706, says that in reviewing agency action, the\n\ncourt \"shall\" take due account of \"the rule of prejudicial\n\nerror,\" i.e., whether the error caused actual prejudice.                             And\n\nwhile     many    of   the      decisions     involve        harmless    substantive\n\nmistakes, no less an authority than Judge Friendly has applied\n\nthe harmless error rule to procedural error, as has the circuit\n\nthat most often reviews agency action.7\n\n            Obviously, a court must be cautious in assuming that\n\nthe   result     would     be    the   same     if    an   error,     procedural     or\n\nsubstantive, had not occurred, and there may be some errors too\n\nfundamental to disregard.              But even in criminal cases involving\n\nconstitutional error, courts may ordinarily conclude that an\n\nadmitted    and    fully     preserved        error    was    \"harmless    beyond      a\n\nreasonable       doubt.\"     Chapman     v.   California,       386     U.S.   18,   24\n\n(1967).     Agency missteps too may be disregarded where it is\n\nclear that a remand \"would accomplish nothing beyond further\n\nexpense and delay.\"          Kerner, 340 F.2d at 740.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n     Kerner v. Celebrezze, 340 F.2d 736, 740 (2d Cir. 1965)\n(Friendly, J.). See also Steel Mfrs. Ass'n v. EPA, 27 F.3d 642,\n649 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (failure to allow comment in hazardous\nwaste standard case was harmless error); Illinois Commerce\nComm'n v. ICC, 848 F.2d 1246, 1257 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (order to\nprepare an environmental assessment or an EIS would be \"a\nmeaningless gesture\"); Gerber v. Babbitt, 146 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4-5\n(D.D.C. 2001) (failure in NEPA case to make site location and\nmap public was harmless procedural error).\n\n                                         -25-\n\f          We will assume that an environmental assessment and\n\nfinding of no significant impact might look somewhat different\n\nin form and follow somewhat more complicated procedures than the\n\nstudy and findings by the FAA in this case.                 See generally 40\n\nC.F.R. §§ 1501.4, 1508.9, 1508.13 (2000).             But this case does\n\nnot   involve     a     simple   refusal   to     study      environmentally\n\nproblematic consequences.          On the contrary, even though only\n\nseven to ten flights a day are realistically at issue, the FAA\n\nexamined each of the three principal possible negative effects\n\nand found each to be de minimis, and petitioners have provided\n\nno basis for serious doubt about those findings.\n\n          Under         these    circumstances,       the     presence    of\n\n\"controversy\" is beside the point.         Ultimately, the entire NEPA\n\nprocess is designed to make certain that significant negative\n\neffects are taken into account.        See Robertson v. Methow Valley\n\nCitizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348-50 (1989).               Remanding for a\n\ndifferently     named    assessment,   where    the   project's     negative\n\nconsequences have already been analyzed and found to be absent\n\nand the findings have been disclosed to interested parties, is\n\na waste of time.           If there was error in denominating the\n\nassessment, it was patently harmless.\n\n          The same is true of petitioners' argument that the FAA\n\ncommitted a procedural error by failing to consult adequately\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\fwith the Massachusetts Historical Commission.          As already noted,\n\nNHPA imposes an obligation not only to take account of adverse\n\neffects of an \"undertaking\" on historic properties but also to\n\npermit the federal Advisory Council a \"reasonable opportunity to\n\ncomment.\"      This     might   sound    like   an    obligation   easily\n\ndischarged, but that is far from the case.\n\n            On the contrary, the Advisory Council's regulations,\n\nonce they are triggered, impose a complex consultative process.\n\nSee generally 36 C.F.R Part 800 (2000).              Although the choice\n\nwhether to approve the undertaking ultimately remains with the\n\nagency, it must consult with the state historic preservation\n\nofficer--here,    the    Massachusetts    Historical     Commission--and\n\nother \"consulting parties\" about adverse effects on historic\n\nproperties, document any no- effect finding, and submit the\n\neffects issue to binding review by the Advisory Council if the\n\nstate officer and the federal agency disagree.             36 C.F.R. §§\n\n800.4, 800.5 (2000).      If adverse effects are established, even\n\nmore complex steps are entailed.8\n\n\n    8Assuming an adverse effect is found, the agency must\nconsult with the state officer and other consulting parties to\ndevelop and evaluate mitigation measures.   36 C.F.R. § 800.6\n(2000). The process is then completed either by a \"memorandum\nof agreement\" between the agency and the consulting parties,\nwhich then governs the federal undertaking, 16 U.S.C. § 470h-\n2(l), or by termination of the consultation by the agency\nfollowed by the issuance of formal comments by the Advisory\nCouncil, 36 C.F.R. § 800.7 (2000).\n\n                                  -27-\n\f             Understandably, agencies are loath to submit to this\n\ncumbersome process, and the NHPA regulation in effect at the\n\ntime the FAA acted contained a categorical exemption from the\n\nconsultation process where \"the undertaking does not have the\n\npotential to cause effects on historic properties.\"                       36 C.F.R.\n\n§ 800.3(a)(1) (2000).             No consultation was required for this\n\ndecision.     64 Fed. Reg. 27,063 (1999).                 The FAA found that the\n\nLaGuardia     flights       had    no    such    potential       and,   after    some\n\nconsultation with the state officer, discontinued the process,\n\nrelying on the regulation's exemption.\n\n             As already explained, petitioners make nothing close\n\nto a colorable attack on the FAA's finding that the ten or fewer\n\nLaGuardia flights in question would not adversely affect nearby\n\nhistoric     sites     in     any       substantial       way.      Nevertheless,\n\npetitioners        argue    that    under       section     800.3(a)(1)     of     the\n\nregulations, it is enough to trigger the consultation process\n\nthat   the   FAA    action    is    a    \"type    of   activity\"--a       change    in\n\noperating specifications--that in some other case could have a\n\npotential adverse affect.\n\n             The    main    support      for    this   reading    comes   from     the\n\nlanguage in the overarching paragraph (section 800.3(a)) and the\n\nAdvisory Council's amendment of section 800.3(a)(1) following\n\nthe FAA decision in this case, 65 Fed. Reg. 77,698, 77,726 (Dec.\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\f12, 2000), both of which employ the \"type of activity\" language.9\n\nThe Advisory Council claims that the amendment reflects what the\n\nregulation always meant.        Although it is not the most natural\n\nreading of the original regulation, a definitive judgment as to\n\nmeaning   would   have   to   allow   some   deference   to   an   agency's\n\nclarification.    See Thomas Jefferson Univ. 512 U.S. at 512.\n\n           At the same time, the current regulation could make the\n\nexemption useless to the FAA--at least, if the FAA continues to\n\nview \"operating specifications\" as the category to which \"type\"\n\nrefers.   One could easily think of          some change in operating\n\nspecifications--as to equipment, frequency or other variables--\n\nthat could have a significant environmental effect.            Of course,\n\nthe current regulation does not define the notion of a \"type\";\n\nconceivably, the FAA could still distinguish among \"types\" of\n\n\n\n     9\n     Prior to the amendment, 36 C.F.R. § 800.3(a) (2000) read as\nfollows:\n         (a) The Agency Official shall determine\n         whether the proposed Federal action is an\n         undertaking . . . and, if so, whether it is\n         a type of activity that has the potential to\n         cause effects on historic properties. . . .\n         (1) If the undertaking does not have the\n         potential to cause effects on historic\n         properties, the Agency Official has no\n         further obligations under section 106.\n\nThe amendment changed section 800.3(a)(1) to read \"If the\nundertaking is a type of activity that does not have the\npotential to cause effects on historic properties. . . .\" 65\nFed. Reg. 77,698, 77,728 (Dec. 12, 2000).\n\n                                  -29-\n\famendments so as to preserve some role for the categorical\n\nexception.\n\n          We need not resolve any of these questions.                   The\n\nconsultative process under NHPA, like the process of creating an\n\nEIS or environmental assessment under NEPA, is intended in the\n\nend to identify and measure the adverse effects of a proposed\n\naction on a protected interest (historic properties for NHPA,\n\nthe   environment   for   NEPA)   so     that   those   effects   can    be\n\nconsidered by the responsible agency.\n\n          Here, the FAA did make specific findings that the\n\neffects on the environment and on historic properties from ten\n\nor so daily flights, against the backdrop of nearly 100,000\n\nflights a year, would be de minimis.            If the question were at\n\nall close and if plausible doubts had been raised, requiring a\n\nmore elaborate assessment with more extensive consultation might\n\nserve some useful purpose.        But neither is the case and, in\n\nthese circumstances, the error (if there was one) is harmless.\n\n\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\f",

The petitioners--two preservationist organizations, three of the four towns (Bedford is an intervenor), and stewards of several nearby historic sites--seek review of the FAA decision on the ground that the agency did not adequately consider the adverse effect of the additional Shuttle America flights on historic and natural resources near Hanscom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hanscom has been a major aviation facility since 1940, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts first acquired the site to accommodate the U.S. Army Air Corps. In 1973 the Massachusetts Port Authority (\"MassPort\") converted a portion of the site into a general aviation facility serving corporate aviation, flight schools, air charter operations, light cargo, and private business and recreational flights. (The U.S. Air Force uses the remainder as Hanscom Air Force Base.) In 1995, there were about 95,000 general aviation and military flights (defined as a departure and an arrival) at Hanscom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recent years, MassPort and the FAA have expanded commercial passenger service at Hanscom, seeking to lessen congestion at Boston's Logan International Airport. These steps have concerned community groups who fear that the increased noise, air pollution, and surface traffic from the additional flights will harm the natural and historic resources near Hanscom. These sites include Minute Man National Historic Park, Walden Pond, and the homes of eminent American authors such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Louisa May Alcott. The main access road to Hanscom is a part of Route 2A, which runs through the heart of Minute Man National Park.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1999, MassPort backed a plan to let Shuttle America--a commuter airline then operating out of several airports on the East Coast--provide scheduled passenger service at Hanscom. To this end, Shuttle America asked the FAA to add Hanscom to the list of airport destinations in its operating specifications. MassPort asked the FAA to upgrade Hanscom's operating certificate to a \"full Part 139 certificate,\" which allows use of planes with greater than 30 seats. See generally 14 C.F.R. Part 139 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA granted both requests in September 1999, and Shuttle America immediately commenced passenger service out of Hanscom, with four daily round-trip flights. The FAA determined that it did not need to perform an environmental analysis for the two approvals because they were categorically excluded from review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4321 et seq. (1994). It also concluded that the categorical exclusion under NEPA obviated the need for consultation under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (\"NHPA\"), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470f (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which is authorized to enforce NHPA, see 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470s, questioned the FAA's reading of NHPA, and petitioner Save Our Heritage unsuccessfully sought reconsideration and rehearing of both the Part 139 certification and the addition of Hanscom to Shuttle America's operating specifications. However, no party sought timely judicial review of either of the FAA's decisions; such review is now time-barred. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46110(a) (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Shuttle America applied for the operating specifications amendment at issue in this case--an amendment to add LaGuardia to its list of approved airport destinations. It proposed to make seven round-trip flights between Hanscom and LaGuardia, with the possibility of eventually expanding the service to ten flights a day. The FAA expressed doubt that NHPA consultation was required, but in light of the Advisory Council's earlier concerns, it decided it would be \"prudent\" to consult provisionally with the Massachusetts Historical Commission, which the Commonwealth had designated as its NHPA consulting agency. After conducting an environmental analysis, the FAA proposed a finding that the additional flights to LaGuardia would have no potential adverse effect on historic properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners Save Our Heritage and the Hanscom-area towns sent the FAA detailed criticisms of its proposed finding, and the Massachusetts Historical Commission also refused to concur. After providing additional documentation in an unsuccessful effort to persuade the Commission, the FAA terminated the consultation and, on October 27, 2000, issued the amendment (\"the LaGuardia amendment\"). Shuttle America began commercial service from Hanscom to LaGuardia with five round-trip flights per day, later reaching a peak of seven daily round-trip flights in January 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct review, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46110(a), petitioners now ask us to set aside and enjoin the LaGuardia amendment on the grounds the FAA decision violated NEPA, NHPA, and Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303(c) (1994) (originally codified at 49 U.S.C. &#167; 1653(f) (1970)). The statutory requirements are described below. The gist of the FAA's position is that its \"effects\" determination--that the addition of seven to ten flights a day would have no significant environmental impact--exempted the amendment from or otherwise satisfied these requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, the FAA and supporting intervenors raise two objections to our consideration of the case. The first is that the petitioners lack Article III standing, and the second is that the petitions are effectively out-of-time attacks on prior agency orders. Because the first challenge is constitutional, we start with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic requirements for Article III standing are that the petitioner is someone who has suffered or is threatened by injury in fact to a cognizable interest, that the injury is causally connected to the defendant's action, and that it can be abated by a remedy the court is competent to give.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> What constitutes a \"cognizable interest\" can present vexing problems, see Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction &#167; 2.3, at 68-74 (3d ed. 1999), but here the FAA and supporting intervenors concede that aesthetic and environmental injury are cognizable, see Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 734 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the objections to standing are threefold. The first, and least persuasive, is the suggestion that even if some individuals or organizations are adversely affected by the increased flights, none of the petitioners or identified members of petitioner organizations have shown that they are among those injured. Admittedly, a specified petitioner or identified member must be within the affected group. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt'l Servs., Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 181-84 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the petitioners comprise nonprofit environmental or preservationist associations such as Save Our Heritage; the towns located near Hanscom; and at least two petitioners that own nearby historic sites: the Walden Woods Project, which owns part of the Walden Woods site and operates a Thoreau research and educational facility on it; and the Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association, which manages the writer's home. It is sufficient for the case to proceed if at least one petitioner has standing, Wash. Legal Found. v. Mass. Bar Found., 993 F.2d 962, 971-72 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little reason to doubt that the two nonprofit landowners (Walden Woods Project and the Alcott Association) would be affected by both noise and air pollution, given their function and proximity to Hanscom; and it is likely, although unnecessary to decide, that the three towns themselves would have a direct interest, e.g., in traffic congestion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We need not resolve whether the petitioner associations have established standing based on the rather sparse allegations of injury to the interests of their individual members. See Int'l Union, United Auto., Aero. &amp; Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, 477 U.S. 274, 281-82 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the FAA says that there is no actual or threatened adverse effect on any petitioner because, according to the FAA's findings, the small number of additional flights will have no significant environmental impact. At first blush, this appears to be a question of the merits rather than one of standing; the petitioners certainly allege substantial effects and challenge both the FAA's contrary findings and the procedures used to reach them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not rule out the possibility of cases where the claim of impact is so specious or patently implausible that a threshold standing objection might be appropriate. See, e.g., Town of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 406; Florida Audubon Soc'y v. Bentsen, 94 F.3d 658, 669 (D.C. Cir. 1996). But beyond that, we think that the likelihood and extent of impact are properly addressed in connection with the merits and issues of harmless error. Breyer &amp; Stewart, Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy 1107 (2d ed. 1985); cf. Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 681-84 (1946). A reasonable claim of minimal impact is enough for standing even though it may not trigger agency obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the FAA points out that the order here under review did not increase the number of flights that Shuttle America is authorized to operate at Hanscom. Given prior orders that are now beyond review, Shuttle America was and is entitled to fly an unlimited number of flights to its other, already-approved airports regardless of the outcome of this case. Thus, says the FAA, the order permitting flights to LaGuardia cannot be the cause of the alleged injury to petitioners, because it could fly the same number of flights even if the order were overturned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the same number of flights carrying the same number of passengers would be flown regardless of the present order, the order would hardly be the but-for cause of any impact due to more flights or ground traffic. But as a matter of common sense, Shuttle America likely sought authorization for LaGuardia because it would generate some additional traffic over and above its existing demand. Shuttle America has not shown or offered to show that the number of flights and the amount of car traffic would be identical even without the authorization. Petitioners asserting standing are not required to negate every possibility that the outcome might be the same under highly unusual circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA makes a separate and quite different threshold objection. It says that petitioners are making out-of-time attacks on prior orders. It points out that the statute imposes a 60-day limit on direct review, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46110(a), and, no petition for review having been filed within that time, it argues that it is not open to petitioners now to challenge the orders entered in September 1999 allowing Shuttle America to operate from Hanscom and Hanscom to handle commercial flights using larger planes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No doubt much of the impact on nearby natural and historic sites, assuming the allegations are true, stems from these earlier orders and not from the authorization to add a limited number of flights to LaGuardia. Nevertheless, the petitioners are entitled to claim that an additional impact will be felt from the now-authorized LaGuardia flights, over and above the effects of the prior orders. Whether or not the plausible added effects are so slight as to justify the shortcuts taken by the FAA is a merits issue yet to be addressed; but it does not make an attack on this alleged incremental impact an attack on the wrong order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only to the extent that petitioners are actually seeking redress from the effects of the present orders are their petitions timely, and this limitation must be borne in mind in considering the arguments. Admittedly, there is some language in the briefs that appears to attack the earlier orders because of alleged infirmities in its findings or procedures. But the possibility that some of the petitioners' arguments are time-barred does not defeat those actually directed to the more recent order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the merits. Although the claims can be segmented in several ways, the underlying issues basically reduce themselves to two: whether the FAA erred substantively in concluding that the additional flights--up to ten new round trips a day--would have a de minimis environmental impact and whether, regardless of impact, the FAA erred procedurally in failing to consult further with governmental agencies concerned with historic preservation. We begin with the \"substantive\" issue which arises, in slightly different frameworks, under three different statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most familiar is NEPA, which requires agencies to develop a detailed environmental impact statement (an \"EIS\") before undertaking \"major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332(2)(C). The NEPA regulations permit agencies to conduct a less demanding \"environmental assessment\" to determine whether an EIS is required; if not, the agency must explain its determination in a \"finding of no significant impact.\" 40 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1501.4 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a regulation whose validity is not in dispute, the FAA effectively concedes that the LaGuardia amendment qualifies as a major federal action. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin. Order 1050.1D, \"Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts,\" App. 4, &#182; 3(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> However, a categorical exclusion excuses the FAA from preparing either an EIS or an environmental assessment for \"operating specifications and amendments thereto which do not significantly change the operating environment of the airport.\" FAA 1050.1D, App. 4, &#182; 4(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This exclusion is itself qualified by an \"extraordinary circumstances\" provision which requires at least an environmental assessment for an otherwise excluded action if the action is, inter alia, \"likely to have an effect that is not minimal on properties protected under Section 106 of [NHPA] or Section 4(f) [of the Transportation Act of 1966],\" or \"likely to be highly controversial on environmental grounds.\" FAA Order 1050.1D, &#182; 32. Petitioners rely on both of these exceptions and argue that the additional flights have more than minimal effects and were highly controversial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NHPA and Section 4(f) impose different requirements than NEPA, in the service of somewhat more focused interests; but the requirements of concern here--with one possible qualification regarding an obligation to consult--both turn (as with NEPA) on whether the agency action poses a plausible environmental threat. A brief description of the two statutes makes this clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NHPA, heavily relied on by petitioners, is designed to protect certain \"historic properties,\" which indisputably include sites near Hanscom. Section 106 of the statute requires that prior to a proposed federal \"undertaking,\" the agency must \"take into account the effect\" on such properties and allow the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a \"reasonable opportunity to comment.\" 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470f. The act thus imposes both a substantive obligation to weigh effects in deciding whether to authorize the federal action and a procedural obligation to consult. See generally 36 C.F.R. Part 800 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grant of a permit such as the LaGuardia authorization can certainly qualify as an undertaking. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470w(7)(C); 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.16(y) (2000); see also Sugarloaf Citizens Ass'n v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm'n, 959 F.2d 508, 515 (4th Cir. 1992). But even if the approval of the LaGuardia flights is assumed to be an undertaking, the substantive obligation to \"take into account the effect\" of the flights on historic properties is beside the point if there is no potential adverse effect. See 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.3(a)(1) (2000). To that extent, the question under NEPA and under NHPA is the same: whether the FAA erred in finding that any impact of the newly authorized flights on the surrounding area was de minimis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last of the three statutes--Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act--is even more stringent where it applies. It protects certain public parks and historic sites, again indisputably including some near Hanscom, from any \"transportation program or project\" requiring the \"use\" of such park or land, unless certain quite restrictive tests have been met. To proceed in the teeth of such a \"use,\" the agency must find that there is no feasible alternative to using that land and that the program or project includes all possible planning to minimize harm. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, one might think that Section 4(f) could have nothing to do with authorizing new flights from an existing, physically unaltered airport; but the statute has been read to apply not only to a physical use or occupancy of protected parks or land but also to activities that will have a serious indirect impact on the protected park or land--a so-called \"constructive use.\" 23 C.F.R. &#167; 771.135(p)(1)(iii) (2000); Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 161 F.3d 569, 583 (9th Cir. 1998). Once again, the FAA's finding that the LaGuardia flights would have only a de minimis effect would avoid the statute if the finding were to be upheld. Adler v. Lewis, 675 F.2d 1085, 1092 (9th Cir. 1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What, then, underpins the FAA's finding of de minimis impact in this case? The starting point is that independent of the LaGuardia flights, Hanscom handled just under 100,000 flights in 1999, and the disputed LaGuardia flights would add, at a maximum, ten more flights per day. The more realistic estimate of seven flights, according to the FAA, would produce an annual increase in Hanscom flights of about 2.5 percent--a number that absent special circumstances would approach the trivial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This figure might at first appear to understate the potential environmental effect because most existing Hanscom flights are private aircraft, which are somewhat smaller and carry fewer passengers than even the modest 50 passenger turboprop planes used by Shuttle America. On the other hand, some of the resulting ground traffic occurs in non-peak periods where existing levels are light, and the new flights use turboprop aircraft considerably quieter than the corporate jets and other civilian aircraft currently using the airport. Thus, certain effects of the additional flights may be less than the already small percentage increase in the number of flights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we need not rely on such inferences because here the FAA directly studied the three types of potential effects from the additional flights: noise, fuel emissions, and surface traffic from passenger travel to and from the airport. As background for considering the effects, the FAA extrapolated from MassPort's 1995 Generic Environmental Impact Report (\"the GEIR\"), actually completed in 1997, which projected and extensively assessed the noise, emissions, and traffic effects of future Hanscom operations under zero, modest, and robust growth scenarios for commercial aviation. It also relied on a surface traffic study performed in 2000 for the adjacent Hanscom Air Force Base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA summarized its findings in two letters (on September 15, 2000 and October 6, 2000) to the Massachusetts Historical Commission. The FAA first compared the actual number of flights in 1999 (prior to the LaGuardia authorization) with the GEIR's 1999 projections under the modest growth scenario, and found that the GEIR's forecast was nearly exact (approximately 99,000 flights). This both confirmed the accuracy of the GEIR and, since the GEIR indicated no significant environmental concerns under the modest growth scenario, showed that pre-amendment baseline conditions were acceptable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA then conducted its own studies, which found that the additional LaGuardia flights would not exacerbate environmental conditions. As to noise, the FAA found that the additional flights would have a 1 percent or less increase in the 65 DNL dB noise contour, which indicates noise levels compatible with all land uses, see 14 C.F.R. Part 150, App. A, Tbl. 1 (2001), under a test in which a 17 percent increase is deemed significant. It also found that the 65 DNL dB noise contour would continue to remain \"almost completely on airport property\" and that most of Minute Man National Park and Walden Woods would fall outside the 55 DNL dB line.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It thus concluded that the area around Hanscom \"should not experience appreciable increases in aircraft noise or overflights\" as a result of the added air traffic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For air quality effects, the FAA used a model that took account of emissions both from aircraft (accounting for factors such as equipment type and including take-off, taxi, and idling time) and surface vehicles (both passenger traffic and ground support equipment). The FAA concluded that the potential emissions associated with the LaGuardia flights were \"below de minimis levels\" as to both of the two critical ozone-producing pollutants and that the new flights would not undercut the state's implementation plan for air quality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for surface traffic, the FAA found that none of the flights would affect peak morning traffic and only one would affect peak evening traffic. Estimating that each flight would generate 70 additional vehicle trips, it concluded that, at worst, the peak evening flight would increase traffic at several intersections on Route 2A by only about 2.65 percent, which the FAA deemed minimal and within the GEIR projection already found to be tolerable. As for noise increase, it found that the increased traffic volume would raise the peak level by less than 0.3 dB, \"which is not a perceptible increase.\" See 23 C.F.R. &#167; 771.135(p)(5)(iii) (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remarkably, in their lengthy submissions, petitioners make no direct attack on the aircraft noise or air pollution conclusions. Petitioners say only that any reliance on the GEIR was \"inappropriate\" because it was prepared for \"unrelated\" operations and is out of date. But in fact, the FAA verified the GEIR's accuracy by finding that the actual growth at Hanscom as of 1999 coincided almost exactly with the GEIR \"modest growth\" scenario whose environmental effects had already been considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA's surface traffic analysis gets more attention, but even here their discussion is limited to a few pages and is confined to three brands of criticism: highly general claims that the agency's analysis is inadequate (e.g., that the FAA should have discussed non-peak hour traffic or other intersections); criticisms of the agency's factual assumptions (e.g., that the FAA underestimated the number of vehicle trips that each passenger would take); or abstract statements of disagreement by other entities (e.g., claims by the National Park Service that increased traffic would have \"serious detrimental impacts\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under settled doctrine, the FAA's factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46110(c), and its reasoning is tested for reasonableness under an arbitrary and capricious standard. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A); Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 164 F.3d 713, 718-20 (1st Cir. 1999). Further, it is up to those who assail its findings or reasoning to identify the defects in evidence and the faults in reasoning. Lomak Petroleum, Inc. v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm'n, 206 F.3d 1193, 1198 (D.C. Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the agency is dealing with a very complicated and technical subject, this takes a lot of work by lawyers in culling the record and organizing the information for the reviewing court, but it can be done. Here, the FAA's final assessment--that a tiny percentage increase in flights would have a de minimis effect--is presumptively inviting but, in principle, can be overcome by a sustained and organized rebuttal. Nothing offered by petitioners approaches such an effort. Gauzy generalizations and pin-prick criticisms, in the face of specific findings and a plausible result, are not even a start at a serious assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one obvious concern, and it is not about the impact of this extremely modest increase in Shuttle America flights. Conceivably, Shuttle America or another airline could appear with a succession of new-destination proposals, each modest in size and in impact; and yet the cumulative effect of the FAA approvals could be major even though no one approval was significant in itself. Either a clear plan for such successive steps or proof that such a succession was foreseeable could conceivably require an overall prospective assessment. 40 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1508.4, 1508.27(b)(7) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we are not faced with any such developed claim in this case, nor do the known facts suggest any such thing. At the time of Shuttle America's application, commercial service at Hanscom had been a repeated failure, and there was no reason to believe, at that point, that demand would dramatically increase. Now, Shuttle America has reduced its operations and is under the protection of the bankruptcy court. If Shuttle America or other airlines undertake a series of proposed expansions, it will be time enough to consider whether new and projected activities need to be considered together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners say that even if the minimal effects finding stands, the FAA's own regulations still required at least an environmental assessment under NEPA because the proposed action was \"highly controversial on environmental grounds.\" FAA Order 1050.1D &#182; 32(b). The FAA's regulations, read literally, indicate that this test is met if the \"action\" in question is \"opposed on environmental grounds by a Federal, State, or local government agency or by a substantial number of the persons affected.\" FAA Order 1050.1D, &#182; 17. Although the federal and state agencies did not formally oppose the LaGuardia flights (instead simply asking for more study), the four adjoining towns flatly opposed the new flights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing a number of cases, the FAA argues that whether a project is environmentally controversial does not depend on whether vocal opponents exist but on whether reasonable disagreement exists over the project's risk of causing environmental harm. See, e.g., Found. for N. Am. Wild Sheep v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 681 F.2d 1172, 1182 (9th Cir. 1982). Otherwise, says the FAA, projects could be bogged down by a \"heckler's veto\" despite the lack of a genuine environmental threat. The FAA says that its own assessment here that the project is not objectively controversial is entitled to deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA's approach certainly makes sense on policy grounds, but it is in some tension with the wording of its own regulation, which seems to make official opposition to the proposed \"action\" the trigger. By contrast, the decisions on which the FAA relies interpret \"controversial\" as used in other regulations, where the term modifies \"effects\"--phrasing more helpful to the FAA's reading. See, e.g., id. (interpreting 40 C.F.R. &#167; 1508.27(b)(4)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether the latitude allowed to the agency in interpreting its own regulations, see Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512 (1994), stretches to a reading that may make policy sense but appears at odds with the language. (Certainly the FAA might wish expressly to clarify its language for future cases.) Rather, we think that even if the \"controversial\" action regulation is read in petitioners' favor, it makes no sense to remand for an environmental assessment where, as here, the FAA has already made a reasoned finding that the environmental effects are de minimis. In a nutshell, the failure to make a more formal assessment was harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of harmless error is as much a part of judicial review of administrative action as of appellate review of trial court judgments. Indeed, the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706, says that in reviewing agency action, the court \"shall\" take due account of \"the rule of prejudicial error,\" i.e., whether the error caused actual prejudice. And while many of the decisions involve harmless substantive mistakes, no less an authority than Judge Friendly has applied the harmless error rule to procedural error, as has the circuit that most often reviews agency action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, a court must be cautious in assuming that the result would be the same if an error, procedural or substantive, had not occurred, and there may be some errors too fundamental to disregard. But even in criminal cases involving constitutional error, courts may ordinarily conclude that an admitted and fully preserved error was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). Agency missteps too may be disregarded where it is clear that a remand \"would accomplish nothing beyond further expense and delay.\" Kerner, 340 F.2d at 740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume that an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact might look somewhat different in form and follow somewhat more complicated procedures than the study and findings by the FAA in this case. See generally 40 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1501.4, 1508.9, 1508.13 (2000). But this case does not involve a simple refusal to study environmentally problematic consequences. On the contrary, even though only seven to ten flights a day are realistically at issue, the FAA examined each of the three principal possible negative effects and found each to be de minimis, and petitioners have provided no basis for serious doubt about those findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the presence of \"controversy\" is beside the point. Ultimately, the entire NEPA process is designed to make certain that significant negative effects are taken into account. See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 348-50 (1989). Remanding for a differently named assessment, where the project's negative consequences have already been analyzed and found to be absent and the findings have been disclosed to interested parties, is a waste of time. If there was error in denominating the assessment, it was patently harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is true of petitioners' argument that the FAA committed a procedural error by failing to consult adequately with the Massachusetts Historical Commission. As already noted, NHPA imposes an obligation not only to take account of adverse effects of an \"undertaking\" on historic properties but also to permit the federal Advisory Council a \"reasonable opportunity to comment.\" This might sound like an obligation easily discharged, but that is far from the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the contrary, the Advisory Council's regulations, once they are triggered, impose a complex consultative process. See generally 36 C.F.R Part 800 (2000). Although the choice whether to approve the undertaking ultimately remains with the agency, it must consult with the state historic preservation officer--here, the Massachusetts Historical Commission--and other \"consulting parties\" about adverse effects on historic properties, document any no- effect finding, and submit the effects issue to binding review by the Advisory Council if the state officer and the federal agency disagree. 36 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 800.4, 800.5 (2000). If adverse effects are established, even more complex steps are entailed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understandably, agencies are loath to submit to this cumbersome process, and the NHPA regulation in effect at the time the FAA acted contained a categorical exemption from the consultation process where \"the undertaking does not have the potential to cause effects on historic properties.\" 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.3(a)(1) (2000). No consultation was required for this decision. 64 Fed. Reg. 27,063 (1999). The FAA found that the LaGuardia flights had no such potential and, after some consultation with the state officer, discontinued the process, relying on the regulation's exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already explained, petitioners make nothing close to a colorable attack on the FAA's finding that the ten or fewer LaGuardia flights in question would not adversely affect nearby historic sites in any substantial way. Nevertheless, petitioners argue that under section 800.3(a)(1) of the regulations, it is enough to trigger the consultation process that the FAA action is a \"type of activity\"--a change in operating specifications--that in some other case could have a potential adverse affect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main support for this reading comes from the language in the overarching paragraph (section 800.3(a)) and the Advisory Council's amendment of section 800.3(a)(1) following the FAA decision in this case, 65 Fed. Reg. 77,698, 77,726 (Dec. 12, 2000), both of which employ the \"type of activity\" language.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The Advisory Council claims that the amendment reflects what the regulation always meant. Although it is not the most natural reading of the original regulation, a definitive judgment as to meaning would have to allow some deference to an agency's clarification. See Thomas Jefferson Univ. 512 U.S. at 512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, the current regulation could make the exemption useless to the FAA--at least, if the FAA continues to view \"operating specifications\" as the category to which \"type\" refers. One could easily think of some change in operating specifications--as to equipment, frequency or other variables--that could have a significant environmental effect. Of course, the current regulation does not define the notion of a \"type\"; conceivably, the FAA could still distinguish among \"types\" of amendments so as to preserve some role for the categorical exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve any of these questions. The consultative process under NHPA, like the process of creating an EIS or environmental assessment under NEPA, is intended in the end to identify and measure the adverse effects of a proposed action on a protected interest (historic properties for NHPA, the environment for NEPA) so that those effects can be considered by the responsible agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the FAA did make specific findings that the effects on the environment and on historic properties from ten or so daily flights, against the backdrop of nearly 100,000 flights a year, would be de minimis. If the question were at all close and if plausible doubts had been raised, requiring a more elaborate assessment with more extensive consultation might serve some useful purpose. But neither is the case and, in these circumstances, the error (if there was one) is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The four Hanscom-area towns unsuccessfully sued in Massachusetts state court to enjoin MassPort's application on the ground that it violated promises made in MassPort's 1978 Hanscom Master Plan.

The petitioners--two preservationist organizations, three of the four towns (Bedford is an intervenor), and stewards of several nearby historic sites--seek review of the FAA decision on the ground that the agency did not adequately consider the adverse effect of the additional Shuttle America flights on historic and natural resources near Hanscom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hanscom has been a major aviation facility since 1940, when the Commonwealth of Massachusetts first acquired the site to accommodate the U.S. Army Air Corps. In 1973 the Massachusetts Port Authority (\"MassPort\") converted a portion of the site into a general aviation facility serving corporate aviation, flight schools, air charter operations, light cargo, and private business and recreational flights. (The U.S. Air Force uses the remainder as Hanscom Air Force Base.) In 1995, there were about 95,000 general aviation and military flights (defined as a departure and an arrival) at Hanscom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recent years, MassPort and the FAA have expanded commercial passenger service at Hanscom, seeking to lessen congestion at Boston's Logan International Airport. These steps have concerned community groups who fear that the increased noise, air pollution, and surface traffic from the additional flights will harm the natural and historic resources near Hanscom. These sites include Minute Man National Historic Park, Walden Pond, and the homes of eminent American authors such as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Louisa May Alcott. The main access road to Hanscom is a part of Route 2A, which runs through the heart of Minute Man National Park.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1999, MassPort backed a plan to let Shuttle America--a commuter airline then operating out of several airports on the East Coast--provide scheduled passenger service at Hanscom. To this end, Shuttle America asked the FAA to add Hanscom to the list of airport destinations in its operating specifications. MassPort asked the FAA to upgrade Hanscom's operating certificate to a \"full Part 139 certificate,\" which allows use of planes with greater than 30 seats. See generally 14 C.F.R. Part 139 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA granted both requests in September 1999, and Shuttle America immediately commenced passenger service out of Hanscom, with four daily round-trip flights. The FAA determined that it did not need to perform an environmental analysis for the two approvals because they were categorically excluded from review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (\"NEPA\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4321 et seq. (1994). It also concluded that the categorical exclusion under NEPA obviated the need for consultation under Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (\"NHPA\"), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470f (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, which is authorized to enforce NHPA, see 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470s, questioned the FAA's reading of NHPA, and petitioner Save Our Heritage unsuccessfully sought reconsideration and rehearing of both the Part 139 certification and the addition of Hanscom to Shuttle America's operating specifications. However, no party sought timely judicial review of either of the FAA's decisions; such review is now time-barred. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46110(a) (1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 2000, Shuttle America applied for the operating specifications amendment at issue in this case--an amendment to add LaGuardia to its list of approved airport destinations. It proposed to make seven round-trip flights between Hanscom and LaGuardia, with the possibility of eventually expanding the service to ten flights a day. The FAA expressed doubt that NHPA consultation was required, but in light of the Advisory Council's earlier concerns, it decided it would be \"prudent\" to consult provisionally with the Massachusetts Historical Commission, which the Commonwealth had designated as its NHPA consulting agency. After conducting an environmental analysis, the FAA proposed a finding that the additional flights to LaGuardia would have no potential adverse effect on historic properties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners Save Our Heritage and the Hanscom-area towns sent the FAA detailed criticisms of its proposed finding, and the Massachusetts Historical Commission also refused to concur. After providing additional documentation in an unsuccessful effort to persuade the Commission, the FAA terminated the consultation and, on October 27, 2000, issued the amendment (\"the LaGuardia amendment\"). Shuttle America began commercial service from Hanscom to LaGuardia with five round-trip flights per day, later reaching a peak of seven daily round-trip flights in January 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On direct review, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46110(a), petitioners now ask us to set aside and enjoin the LaGuardia amendment on the grounds the FAA decision violated NEPA, NHPA, and Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act of 1966, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303(c) (1994) (originally codified at 49 U.S.C. &#167; 1653(f) (1970)). The statutory requirements are described below. The gist of the FAA's position is that its \"effects\" determination--that the addition of seven to ten flights a day would have no significant environmental impact--exempted the amendment from or otherwise satisfied these requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the threshold, the FAA and supporting intervenors raise two objections to our consideration of the case. The first is that the petitioners lack Article III standing, and the second is that the petitions are effectively out-of-time attacks on prior agency orders. Because the first challenge is constitutional, we start with it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic requirements for Article III standing are that the petitioner is someone who has suffered or is threatened by injury in fact to a cognizable interest, that the injury is causally connected to the defendant's action, and that it can be abated by a remedy the court is competent to give.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> What constitutes a \"cognizable interest\" can present vexing problems, see Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction &#167; 2.3, at 68-74 (3d ed. 1999), but here the FAA and supporting intervenors concede that aesthetic and environmental injury are cognizable, see Sierra Club v. Morton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108502\"><a href=\"/opinion/108502/sierra-club-v-morton/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 734 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, the objections to standing are threefold. The first, and least persuasive, is the suggestion that even if some individuals or organizations are adversely affected by the increased flights, none of the petitioners or identified members of petitioner organizations have shown that they are among those injured. Admittedly, a specified petitioner or identified member must be within the affected group. See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envt'l Servs., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118329\"><a href=\"/opinion/118329/friends-of-earth-v-laidlaw-environmental-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></a></span>, 181-84 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the petitioners comprise nonprofit environmental or preservationist associations such as Save Our Heritage; the towns located near Hanscom; and at least two petitioners that own nearby historic sites: the Walden Woods Project, which owns part of the Walden Woods site and operates a Thoreau research and educational facility on it; and the Louisa May Alcott Memorial Association, which manages the writer's home. It is sufficient for the case to proceed if at least one petitioner has standing, Wash. Legal Found. v. Mass. Bar Found., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"607106\"><a href=\"/opinion/607106/washington-legal-foundation-v-massachusetts-bar-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span>, 971-72 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is little reason to doubt that the two nonprofit landowners (Walden Woods Project and the Alcott Association) would be affected by both noise and air pollution, given their function and proximity to Hanscom; and it is likely, although unnecessary to decide, that the three towns themselves would have a direct interest, e.g., in traffic congestion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We need not resolve whether the petitioner associations have established standing based on the rather sparse allegations of injury to the interests of their individual members. See Int'l Union, United Auto., Aero. &amp; Agric. Implement Workers of Am. v. Brock, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111720\"><a href=\"/opinion/111720/automobile-workers-v-brock/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span>, 281-82 (1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the FAA says that there is no actual or threatened adverse effect on any petitioner because, according to the FAA's findings, the small number of additional flights will have no significant environmental impact. At first blush, this appears to be a question of the merits rather than one of standing; the petitioners certainly allege substantial effects and challenge both the FAA's contrary findings and the procedures used to reach them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not rule out the possibility of cases where the claim of impact is so specious or patently implausible that a threshold standing objection might be appropriate. See, e.g., Town of Norwood, 202 F.3d at 406; Florida Audubon Soc'y v. Bentsen, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></span>, 669 (D.C. Cir. 1996). But beyond that, we think that the likelihood and extent of impact are properly addressed in connection with the merits and issues of harmless error. Breyer &amp; Stewart, Administrative Law and Regulatory Policy 1107 (2d ed. 1985); cf. Bell v. Hood, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104272\"><a href=\"/opinion/104272/bell-v-hood/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span>, 681-84 (1946). A reasonable claim of minimal impact is enough for standing even though it may not trigger agency obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the FAA points out that the order here under review did not increase the number of flights that Shuttle America is authorized to operate at Hanscom. Given prior orders that are now beyond review, Shuttle America was and is entitled to fly an unlimited number of flights to its other, already-approved airports regardless of the outcome of this case. Thus, says the FAA, the order permitting flights to LaGuardia cannot be the cause of the alleged injury to petitioners, because it could fly the same number of flights even if the order were overturned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the same number of flights carrying the same number of passengers would be flown regardless of the present order, the order would hardly be the but-for cause of any impact due to more flights or ground traffic. But as a matter of common sense, Shuttle America likely sought authorization for LaGuardia because it would generate some additional traffic over and above its existing demand. Shuttle America has not shown or offered to show that the number of flights and the amount of car traffic would be identical even without the authorization. Petitioners asserting standing are not required to negate every possibility that the outcome might be the same under highly unusual circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA makes a separate and quite different threshold objection. It says that petitioners are making out-of-time attacks on prior orders. It points out that the statute imposes a 60-day limit on direct review, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46110(a), and, no petition for review having been filed within that time, it argues that it is not open to petitioners now to challenge the orders entered in September 1999 allowing Shuttle America to operate from Hanscom and Hanscom to handle commercial flights using larger planes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No doubt much of the impact on nearby natural and historic sites, assuming the allegations are true, stems from these earlier orders and not from the authorization to add a limited number of flights to LaGuardia. Nevertheless, the petitioners are entitled to claim that an additional impact will be felt from the now-authorized LaGuardia flights, over and above the effects of the prior orders. Whether or not the plausible added effects are so slight as to justify the shortcuts taken by the FAA is a merits issue yet to be addressed; but it does not make an attack on this alleged incremental impact an attack on the wrong order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Only to the extent that petitioners are actually seeking redress from the effects of the present orders are their petitions timely, and this limitation must be borne in mind in considering the arguments. Admittedly, there is some language in the briefs that appears to attack the earlier orders because of alleged infirmities in its findings or procedures. But the possibility that some of the petitioners' arguments are time-barred does not defeat those actually directed to the more recent order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the merits. Although the claims can be segmented in several ways, the underlying issues basically reduce themselves to two: whether the FAA erred substantively in concluding that the additional flights--up to ten new round trips a day--would have a de minimis environmental impact and whether, regardless of impact, the FAA erred procedurally in failing to consult further with governmental agencies concerned with historic preservation. We begin with the \"substantive\" issue which arises, in slightly different frameworks, under three different statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most familiar is NEPA, which requires agencies to develop a detailed environmental impact statement (an \"EIS\") before undertaking \"major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332(2)(C). The NEPA regulations permit agencies to conduct a less demanding \"environmental assessment\" to determine whether an EIS is required; if not, the agency must explain its determination in a \"finding of no significant impact.\" 40 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1501.4 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a regulation whose validity is not in dispute, the FAA effectively concedes that the LaGuardia amendment qualifies as a major federal action. Dep't of Transp., Fed. Aviation Admin. Order 1050.1D, \"Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts,\" App. 4, &#182; 3(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> However, a categorical exclusion excuses the FAA from preparing either an EIS or an environmental assessment for \"operating specifications and amendments thereto which do not significantly change the operating environment of the airport.\" FAA 1050.1D, App. 4, &#182; 4(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This exclusion is itself qualified by an \"extraordinary circumstances\" provision which requires at least an environmental assessment for an otherwise excluded action if the action is, inter alia, \"likely to have an effect that is not minimal on properties protected under Section 106 of [NHPA] or Section 4(f) [of the Transportation Act of 1966],\" or \"likely to be highly controversial on environmental grounds.\" FAA Order 1050.1D, &#182; 32. Petitioners rely on both of these exceptions and argue that the additional flights have more than minimal effects and were highly controversial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NHPA and Section 4(f) impose different requirements than NEPA, in the service of somewhat more focused interests; but the requirements of concern here--with one possible qualification regarding an obligation to consult--both turn (as with NEPA) on whether the agency action poses a plausible environmental threat. A brief description of the two statutes makes this clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NHPA, heavily relied on by petitioners, is designed to protect certain \"historic properties,\" which indisputably include sites near Hanscom. Section 106 of the statute requires that prior to a proposed federal \"undertaking,\" the agency must \"take into account the effect\" on such properties and allow the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a \"reasonable opportunity to comment.\" 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470f. The act thus imposes both a substantive obligation to weigh effects in deciding whether to authorize the federal action and a procedural obligation to consult. See generally 36 C.F.R. Part 800 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The grant of a permit such as the LaGuardia authorization can certainly qualify as an undertaking. 16 U.S.C. &#167; 470w(7)(C); 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.16(y) (2000); see also Sugarloaf Citizens Ass'n v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579962\"><a href=\"/opinion/579962/sugarloaf-citizens-association-karen-kalla-j-houston-miller-beverly-thoms/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span>, 515 (4th Cir. 1992). But even if the approval of the LaGuardia flights is assumed to be an undertaking, the substantive obligation to \"take into account the effect\" of the flights on historic properties is beside the point if there is no potential adverse effect. See 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.3(a)(1) (2000). To that extent, the question under NEPA and under NHPA is the same: whether the FAA erred in finding that any impact of the newly authorized flights on the surrounding area was de minimis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last of the three statutes--Section 4(f) of the Department of Transportation Act--is even more stringent where it applies. It protects certain public parks and historic sites, again indisputably including some near Hanscom, from any \"transportation program or project\" requiring the \"use\" of such park or land, unless certain quite restrictive tests have been met. To proceed in the teeth of such a \"use,\" the agency must find that there is no feasible alternative to using that land and that the program or project includes all possible planning to minimize harm. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 303(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush, one might think that Section 4(f) could have nothing to do with authorizing new flights from an existing, physically unaltered airport; but the statute has been read to apply not only to a physical use or occupancy of protected parks or land but also to activities that will have a serious indirect impact on the protected park or land--a so-called \"constructive use.\" 23 C.F.R. &#167; 771.135(p)(1)(iii) (2000); Morongo Band of Mission Indians v. Fed.

Once again, the FAA's finding that the LaGuardia flights would have only a de minimis effect would avoid the statute if the finding were to be upheld. Adler v. Lewis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"402437\"><a href=\"/opinion/402437/constance-a-adler-roosevelt-lathan-and-pearline-lathan-etc-v-andrew/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></a></span>, 1092 (9th Cir. 1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What, then, underpins the FAA's finding of de minimis impact in this case? The starting point is that independent of the LaGuardia flights, Hanscom handled just under 100,000 flights in 1999, and the disputed LaGuardia flights would add, at a maximum, ten more flights per day. The more realistic estimate of seven flights, according to the FAA, would produce an annual increase in Hanscom flights of about 2.5 percent--a number that absent special circumstances would approach the trivial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This figure might at first appear to understate the potential environmental effect because most existing Hanscom flights are private aircraft, which are somewhat smaller and carry fewer passengers than even the modest 50 passenger turboprop planes used by Shuttle America. On the other hand, some of the resulting ground traffic occurs in non-peak periods where existing levels are light, and the new flights use turboprop aircraft considerably quieter than the corporate jets and other civilian aircraft currently using the airport. Thus, certain effects of the additional flights may be less than the already small percentage increase in the number of flights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we need not rely on such inferences because here the FAA directly studied the three types of potential effects from the additional flights: noise, fuel emissions, and surface traffic from passenger travel to and from the airport. As background for considering the effects, the FAA extrapolated from MassPort's 1995 Generic Environmental Impact Report (\"the GEIR\"), actually completed in 1997, which projected and extensively assessed the noise, emissions, and traffic effects of future Hanscom operations under zero, modest, and robust growth scenarios for commercial aviation. It also relied on a surface traffic study performed in 2000 for the adjacent Hanscom Air Force Base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA summarized its findings in two letters (on September 15, 2000 and October 6, 2000) to the Massachusetts Historical Commission. The FAA first compared the actual number of flights in 1999 (prior to the LaGuardia authorization) with the GEIR's 1999 projections under the modest growth scenario, and found that the GEIR's forecast was nearly exact (approximately 99,000 flights). This both confirmed the accuracy of the GEIR and, since the GEIR indicated no significant environmental concerns under the modest growth scenario, showed that pre-amendment baseline conditions were acceptable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA then conducted its own studies, which found that the additional LaGuardia flights would not exacerbate environmental conditions. As to noise, the FAA found that the additional flights would have a 1 percent or less increase in the 65 DNL dB noise contour, which indicates noise levels compatible with all land uses, see 14 C.F.R. Part 150, App. A, Tbl. 1 (2001), under a test in which a 17 percent increase is deemed significant. It also found that the 65 DNL dB noise contour would continue to remain \"almost completely on airport property\" and that most of Minute Man National Park and Walden Woods would fall outside the 55 DNL dB line.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It thus concluded that the area around Hanscom \"should not experience appreciable increases in aircraft noise or overflights\" as a result of the added air traffic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For air quality effects, the FAA used a model that took account of emissions both from aircraft (accounting for factors such as equipment type and including take-off, taxi, and idling time) and surface vehicles (both passenger traffic and ground support equipment). The FAA concluded that the potential emissions associated with the LaGuardia flights were \"below de minimis levels\" as to both of the two critical ozone-producing pollutants and that the new flights would not undercut the state's implementation plan for air quality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for surface traffic, the FAA found that none of the flights would affect peak morning traffic and only one would affect peak evening traffic. Estimating that each flight would generate 70 additional vehicle trips, it concluded that, at worst, the peak evening flight would increase traffic at several intersections on Route 2A by only about 2.65 percent, which the FAA deemed minimal and within the GEIR projection already found to be tolerable. As for noise increase, it found that the increased traffic volume would raise the peak level by less than 0.3 dB, \"which is not a perceptible increase.\" See 23 C.F.R. &#167; 771.135(p)(5)(iii) (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Remarkably, in their lengthy submissions, petitioners make no direct attack on the aircraft noise or air pollution conclusions. Petitioners say only that any reliance on the GEIR was \"inappropriate\" because it was prepared for \"unrelated\" operations and is out of date. But in fact, the FAA verified the GEIR's accuracy by finding that the actual growth at Hanscom as of 1999 coincided almost exactly with the GEIR \"modest growth\" scenario whose environmental effects had already been considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA's surface traffic analysis gets more attention, but even here their discussion is limited to a few pages and is confined to three brands of criticism: highly general claims that the agency's analysis is inadequate (e.g., that the FAA should have discussed non-peak hour traffic or other intersections); criticisms of the agency's factual assumptions (e.g., that the FAA underestimated the number of vehicle trips that each passenger would take); or abstract statements of disagreement by other entities (e.g., claims by the National Park Service that increased traffic would have \"serious detrimental impacts\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under settled doctrine, the FAA's factual findings are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence, 49 U.S.C. &#167; 46110(c), and its reasoning is tested for reasonableness under an arbitrary and capricious standard. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A); Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. Fed. Aviation Admin., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198287\"><a href=\"/opinion/198287/penobscot-air-v-faa/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 718-20 (1st Cir. 1999). Further, it is up to those who assail its findings or reasoning to identify the defects in evidence and the faults in reasoning. Lomak Petroleum, Inc. v. Fed. Energy Reg. Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185102\"><a href=\"/opinion/185102/lomak-petro-inc-v-ferc/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1193</span></a></span>, 1198 (D.C. Cir. 2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where the agency is dealing with a very complicated and technical subject, this takes a lot of work by lawyers in culling the record and organizing the information for the reviewing court, but it can be done. Here, the FAA's final assessment--that a tiny percentage increase in flights would have a de minimis effect--is presumptively inviting but, in principle, can be overcome by a sustained and organized rebuttal. Nothing offered by petitioners approaches such an effort. Gauzy generalizations and pin-prick criticisms, in the face of specific findings and a plausible result, are not even a start at a serious assault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one obvious concern, and it is not about the impact of this extremely modest increase in Shuttle America flights. Conceivably, Shuttle America or another airline could appear with a succession of new-destination proposals, each modest in size and in impact; and yet the cumulative effect of the FAA approvals could be major even though no one approval was significant in itself. Either a clear plan for such successive steps or proof that such a succession was foreseeable could conceivably require an overall prospective assessment. 40 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1508.4, 1508.27(b)(7) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But we are not faced with any such developed claim in this case, nor do the known facts suggest any such thing. At the time of Shuttle America's application, commercial service at Hanscom had been a repeated failure, and there was no reason to believe, at that point, that demand would dramatically increase. Now, Shuttle America has reduced its operations and is under the protection of the bankruptcy court. If Shuttle America or other airlines undertake a series of proposed expansions, it will be time enough to consider whether new and projected activities need to be considered together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners say that even if the minimal effects finding stands, the FAA's own regulations still required at least an environmental assessment under NEPA because the proposed action was \"highly controversial on environmental grounds.\" FAA Order 1050.1D &#182; 32(b). The FAA's regulations, read literally, indicate that this test is met if the \"action\" in question is \"opposed on environmental grounds by a Federal, State, or local government agency or by a substantial number of the persons affected.\" FAA Order 1050.1D, &#182; 17. Although the federal and state agencies did not formally oppose the LaGuardia flights (instead simply asking for more study), the four adjoining towns flatly opposed the new flights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing a number of cases, the FAA argues that whether a project is environmentally controversial does not depend on whether vocal opponents exist but on whether reasonable disagreement exists over the project's risk of causing environmental harm. See, e.g., Found. for N. Am. Wild Sheep v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405954\"><a href=\"/opinion/405954/foundation-for-north-american-wild-sheep-a-corporation-society-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1172</span></a></span>, 1182 (9th Cir. 1982). Otherwise, says the FAA, projects could be bogged down by a \"heckler's veto\" despite the lack of a genuine environmental threat. The FAA says that its own assessment here that the project is not objectively controversial is entitled to deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA's approach certainly makes sense on policy grounds, but it is in some tension with the wording of its own regulation, which seems to make official opposition to the proposed \"action\" the trigger. By contrast, the decisions on which the FAA relies interpret \"controversial\" as used in other regulations, where the term modifies \"effects\"--phrasing more helpful to the FAA's reading. See, e.g., id. (interpreting 40 C.F.R. &#167; 1508.27(b)(4)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether the latitude allowed to the agency in interpreting its own regulations, see Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117865\"><a href=\"/opinion/117865/thomas-jefferson-univ-v-shalala/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 512 (1994), stretches to a reading that may make policy sense but appears at odds with the language. (Certainly the FAA might wish expressly to clarify its language for future cases.) Rather, we think that even if the \"controversial\" action regulation is read in petitioners' favor, it makes no sense to remand for an environmental assessment where, as here, the FAA has already made a reasoned finding that the environmental effects are de minimis. In a nutshell, the failure to make a more formal assessment was harmless error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of harmless error is as much a part of judicial review of administrative action as of appellate review of trial court judgments. Indeed, the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706, says that in reviewing agency action, the court \"shall\" take due account of \"the rule of prejudicial error,\" i.e., whether the error caused actual prejudice. And while many of the decisions involve harmless substantive mistakes, no less an authority than Judge Friendly has applied the harmless error rule to procedural error, as has the circuit that most often reviews agency action.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Obviously, a court must be cautious in assuming that the result would be the same if an error, procedural or substantive, had not occurred, and there may be some errors too fundamental to disregard. But even in criminal cases involving constitutional error, courts may ordinarily conclude that an admitted and fully preserved error was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Chapman v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 24 (1967). Agency missteps too may be disregarded where it is clear that a remand \"would accomplish nothing beyond further expense and delay.\" Kerner, 340 F.2d at 740.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will assume that an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact might look somewhat different in form and follow somewhat more complicated procedures than the study and findings by the FAA in this case. See generally 40 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1501.4, 1508.9, 1508.13 (2000). But this case does not involve a simple refusal to study environmentally problematic consequences. On the contrary, even though only seven to ten flights a day are realistically at issue, the FAA examined each of the three principal possible negative effects and found each to be de minimis, and petitioners have provided no basis for serious doubt about those findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, the presence of \"controversy\" is beside the point. Ultimately, the entire NEPA process is designed to make certain that significant negative effects are taken into account. See Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112255\"><a href=\"/opinion/112255/robertson-v-methow-valley-citizens-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 348-50 (1989). Remanding for a differently named assessment, where the project's negative consequences have already been analyzed and found to be absent and the findings have been disclosed to interested parties, is a waste of time. If there was error in denominating the assessment, it was patently harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is true of petitioners' argument that the FAA committed a procedural error by failing to consult adequately with the Massachusetts Historical Commission. As already noted, NHPA imposes an obligation not only to take account of adverse effects of an \"undertaking\" on historic properties but also to permit the federal Advisory Council a \"reasonable opportunity to comment.\" This might sound like an obligation easily discharged, but that is far from the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the contrary, the Advisory Council's regulations, once they are triggered, impose a complex consultative process. See generally 36 C.F.R Part 800 (2000). Although the choice whether to approve the undertaking ultimately remains with the agency, it must consult with the state historic preservation officer--here, the Massachusetts Historical Commission--and other \"consulting parties\" about adverse effects on historic properties, document any no- effect finding, and submit the effects issue to binding review by the Advisory Council if the state officer and the federal agency disagree. 36 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 800.4, 800.5 (2000). If adverse effects are established, even more complex steps are entailed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Understandably, agencies are loath to submit to this cumbersome process, and the NHPA regulation in effect at the time the FAA acted contained a categorical exemption from the consultation process where \"the undertaking does not have the potential to cause effects on historic properties.\" 36 C.F.R. &#167; 800.3(a)(1) (2000). No consultation was required for this decision. 64 Fed. Reg. 27,063 (1999). The FAA found that the LaGuardia flights had no such potential and, after some consultation with the state officer, discontinued the process, relying on the regulation's exemption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already explained, petitioners make nothing close to a colorable attack on the FAA's finding that the ten or fewer LaGuardia flights in question would not adversely affect nearby historic sites in any substantial way. Nevertheless, petitioners argue that under section 800.3(a)(1) of the regulations, it is enough to trigger the consultation process that the FAA action is a \"type of activity\"--a change in operating specifications--that in some other case could have a potential adverse affect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The main support for this reading comes from the language in the overarching paragraph (section 800.3(a)) and the Advisory Council's amendment of section 800.3(a)(1) following the FAA decision in this case, 65 Fed. Reg. 77,698, 77,726 (Dec. 12, 2000), both of which employ the \"type of activity\" language.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The Advisory Council claims that the amendment reflects what the regulation always meant. Although it is not the most natural reading of the original regulation, a definitive judgment as to meaning would have to allow some deference to an agency's clarification. See Thomas Jefferson Univ. 512 U.S. at 512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, the current regulation could make the exemption useless to the FAA--at least, if the FAA continues to view \"operating specifications\" as the category to which \"type\" refers. One could easily think of some change in operating specifications--as to equipment, frequency or other variables--that could have a significant environmental effect. Of course, the current regulation does not define the notion of a \"type\"; conceivably, the FAA could still distinguish among \"types\" of amendments so as to preserve some role for the categorical exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve any of these questions. The consultative process under NHPA, like the process of creating an EIS or environmental assessment under NEPA, is intended in the end to identify and measure the adverse effects of a proposed action on a protected interest (historic properties for NHPA, the environment for NEPA) so that those effects can be considered by the responsible agency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the FAA did make specific findings that the effects on the environment and on historic properties from ten or so daily flights, against the backdrop of nearly 100,000 flights a year, would be de minimis. If the question were at all close and if plausible doubts had been raised, requiring a more elaborate assessment with more extensive consultation might serve some useful purpose. But neither is the case and, in these circumstances, the error (if there was one) is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The four Hanscom-area towns unsuccessfully sued in Massachusetts state court to enjoin MassPort's application on the ground that it violated promises made in MassPort's 1978 Hanscom Master Plan.
