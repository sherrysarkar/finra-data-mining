Jorge Gonzalez-Vazquez appeals pro se from\r\nthe district court's dismissal of his motion pursuant to 28\r\nU.S.C.  2255.  Because the motion was filed before the\r\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\")\r\ntook effect, AEDPA does not apply.\r\n    Petitioner's central argument on appeal is that his\r\nattorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing\r\nto rebut the government's evidence in support of the two-level\r\nenhancement under U.S.S.G.  2D1.1(b)(1).  We reject that\r\nargument for substantially the same reasons stated by the\r\ndistrict court in its Order Dismissing 28 U.S.C.  2255\r\nPetition, dated June 5, 1996.\r\n    The remaining issues raised by petitioner in this appeal\r\nwere not raised before the district court.  \"This circuit\r\nreligiously follows the rule that issues not presented to the\r\ndistrict court cannot be raised on appeal.\"  Ouimette v.
