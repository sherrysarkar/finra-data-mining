Plaintiff-appellant Jeremiah P. Ahern\r                      Per  Curiam.\r                                 \r\n\nbrought suit  in federal  court against five  individuals and\r\n\nthree entities, seeking declaratory  relief and damages for a\r\n\nvariety of civil rights violations and common-law torts.  The\r\n\ncomplaint alleged that the defendants violated Ahern's rights\r\n\nunder the  Fourth  and  Fourteenth  Amendments  and  asserted\r\n\npendent state-law claims for, inter alia, false arrest, false\r                                                    \r\n\nimprisonment,  and infliction  of  emotional  distress.   The\r\n\nclaims  were  based  upon  events that  resulted  in  Ahern's\r\n\ninvoluntary  admission  to  a  psychiatric facility  and  the\r\n\nsubsequent termination of his  employment as a police officer\r\n\nwith  the  University  of  Massachusetts  at  Boston  (\"UMB\")\r\n\nDepartment of Public Safety (\"DPS\").\r\n\n          The complaint  named as  defendants, in both  their\r\n\nindividual and official capacities, Captain Philip O'Donnell,\r\n\nacting  director  of  the UMB  DPS  at  the  time of  Ahern's\r\n\ninvoluntary  admission  to  the  Arbour  Hospital (\"Arbour\");\r\n\nDavid  Cella, director  of the  UMB DPS  at the  time Ahern's\r\n\nemployment was  terminated; Sergeant Patricia  McBride of the\r\n\nUMB police force; Dr. Tonie Moran, consulting psychologist to\r\n\nthe UMB  DPS;  and  Dr.  Michael Malick,  the  physician  who\r\n\nevaluated Ahern  at Arbour  and who effected  his involuntary\r\n\nadmission to  that  facility.   The three  entities named  as\r\n\ndefendants  were  UMB, Arbour,  and  Ahern's  union, the  UMB\r\n\nPatrolmen's Association (\"the Union\").\r\n\n          Following dismissal of the counts against the Union\r\n\nand Dr. Malick, the remaining parties filed cross motions for\r\r\n\nsummary  judgment.    The   district  court  entered  summary\r\n\njudgment for the defendants on all counts.  Ahern now appeals\r\n\nfrom  that portion  of  the district  court's order  entering\r\n\nsummary   judgment  in  favor  of   Dr.  Moran  and  the  UMB\r\n\ndefendants.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r\n\n          We  view  the record  evidence  in  the light  most\r\n\nfavorable to  Ahern, the party against  whom summary judgment\r\n\nhas entered,  drawing all reasonable competing  inferences in\r\n\nhis favor.  See Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., 100\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 228, 230 (1st  Cir. 1996).  Most of the  predicate facts\r\n\nare not  in dispute, although Ahern  strenuously disputes the\r\n\nsignificance of some of the facts.  The salient events are as\r\n\nfollows.\r\n\n          In the early morning of September 19, 1991, shortly\r\n\nafter  midnight, Deborah  Cate's telephone  answering machine\r\n\nrecorded the following message:  \"Hey.  Guess what?   We took\r\n\ncare  of that  crybaby  old  fuck  of  yours.    The  niggers\r\n\nsplattered  his face all over  Dorchester.  He's  gone.  He's\r\n\ngone.  That  fucking crybaby's all  gone.\"  Ms.  Cate, a  UMB\r\n\nstudent and employee, was not at home at the time of the call\r\n\nand did not  hear the message  until approximately 6:15  that\r\n\nevening.    Cate recognized  the voice  as  that of  Ahern, a\r\n\nformer  boyfriend, and  understood the  message to  mean that\r\n\nAhern  had  caused  James  Igoe,  another  of  Cate's  former\r\n\nboyfriends, to be killed.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n          At the  time of  the September 19th  message, Ahern\r\n\nhad been a member  of the UMB police force  for approximately\r\n\nfour  years.  Cate had  dated and become  intimate with Ahern\r\n\nduring  the spring and summer  of 1990.   Before, during, and\r\n\nafter that same period,  Cate also dated James Igoe,  who was\r\n\nmarried and  had children.   At the time  these relationships\r\n\nwere going on concurrently, Ahern knew of Cate's relationship\r\n\nwith Igoe.  Ahern also knew where Igoe worked.  \r\n\n          Cate dated Ahern through the Fourth of July weekend\r\n\nof 1990,  at which time she  told him that she  wanted to end\r\n\ntheir  relationship.   Ahern was  upset by  this and  for the\r\n\nremainder of the summer of 1990 he attempted to convince Cate\r\n\nto resume the relationship.  According to Cate, he constantly\r\n\nstopped by uninvited to her workplace, interrupting her work,\r\n\ngiving  her  unwanted  gifts,   and  upsetting  her.    Ahern\r\n\nrepeatedly told Cate that he hated  Igoe; that if it were not\r\n\nfor Igoe, Cate would love Ahern; and that he would \"take care\r\n\nof\" Igoe.\r\n\n          Ahern began  a campaign of telephone  calls to Cate\r\n\nin which  he threatened, among  other things, to  tell Igoe's\r\n\nwife and children of the relationship between Cate  and Igoe,\r\n\nand  to  send  Igoe's  wife  photographs  of  Cate  and  Igoe\r\n\ntogether.   In mid-August 1990,  Ahern told Cate  that he had\r\n\nobtained Igoe's home address from the UMB police computer and\r\n\nthat he  was  going to  go  there  to tell  Igoe's  wife  and\r\n\nchildren about Igoe's  affair with Cate.  Ahern  also stalked\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nCate  and  called her  to  let  her  know that  he  had  been\r\n\nfollowing her.  On one occasion, Ahern called Cate while Igoe\r\n\nwas visiting at her apartment.  When Cate answered the phone,\r\n\nAhern  said, \"He's there, isn't he?\" and told her to look out\r\n\nthe  window.  When  she did, she  saw Ahern in  a phone booth\r\n\nacross  the  street from  her house,  looking  up at  her and\r\n\ndisplaying what appeared to her to be a gun.   Ahern does not\r\n\ndispute these allegations but states that by the fall of 1990\r\n\nhe had  ceased his efforts to convince  Cate to return to him\r\n\nand had begun dating another woman.  \r\n\n          Beginning in  the summer  of 1990, after  she ended\r\n\nher  relationship  with Ahern,  Cate  also  began to  receive\r\n\nobscene and threatening  phone calls.   In late September  or\r\n\nOctober 1990, Igoe began to receive harassing and threatening\r\n\ncalls at work.  In the  calls to Igoe, a male caller referred\r\n\nto an  unnamed woman with whom  the caller and Igoe  both had\r\n\nrelationships. \r\n\n          The  sexually  explicit  calls  to  Cate  and  Igoe\r\n\ncontinued through March 1991.  Ahern denied making the calls,\r\n\nthough he admitted that he had been \"a little crazy\" over his\r\n\nbreak-up  with Cate.  In mid-March, Cate told Ahern that Igoe\r\n\nwas  still receiving  harassing calls  and that  she believed\r\n\nthat  he was  the caller.   According  to Cate,  Ahern became\r\n\nnervous  and suggested that the  caller might be  a friend of\r\n\nhis who was  upset with Cate  and Igoe for  the way they  had\r\n\ntreated Ahern.  In April 1991, Cate received another sexually\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nexplicit  message, the  content of  which was  the same  as a\r\n\nmessage left in January.\r\n\n          In  early  July 1991,  against Igoe's  wishes, Cate\r\n\nended their relationship.  In mid-July, Igoe received another\r\n\ncall, in the  course of  which he exclaimed,  \"Look, you  got\r\n\nwhat you  wanted.  You split Debi  and I up.\"   At the end of\r\n\nJuly,  Cate  received  more  threatening,  sexually  explicit\r\n\nmessages.  She was certain that the caller was Ahern.\r\n\n          In  August  1991,  Cate reported  the  obscene  and\r\n\nthreatening phone calls to  the Boston Police Department, but\r\n\ndid not  supply any  information about the  suspected caller.\r\n\nShe  also contacted  the  telephone company,  which placed  a\r\n\n\"trap\" on her phone  for three weeks.  The  telephone company\r\n\nthen advised  Cate  that the  calls she  reported during  the\r\n\nthree-week period were made from local telephone booths, some\r\n\nfrom  the MBTA station near  UMB.  Cate  continued to receive\r\n\nhang-up calls after the trap was removed.\r\n\n          After listening to the September 19th message, Cate\r\n\nbecame frightened and concerned for Igoe's safety because she\r\n\nthought  that the  message could  be \"the  real thing.\"   She\r\n\ncalled Igoe at work, at home, and at his wife's home, but was\r\n\nunable  to reach him.  Panicked, she called the Boston Police\r\n\nDepartment.  She told a detective about the message and asked\r\n\nif any serious  incidents had  been reported that  day.   The\r\n\ndetective  ultimately recommended  that  Cate  call  Patricia\r\n\nMcBride, a sergeant on the UMB police force.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\n          At approximately 6:30 p.m.,  Cate called McBride to\r\n\nreport the  threatening and  harassing phone calls.   McBride\r\n\noffered to  interview Cate at  her apartment, rather  than at\r\n\nthe  DPS station,  because  the complaint  involved a  fellow\r\n\nofficer.   At Cate's  apartment, Cate suggested  that McBride\r\n\nlisten to  the disturbing  message herself.   After listening\r\n\nfor a short time,  McBride was convinced that the  caller was\r\n\nAhern.   Cate  then told  McBride that  she was  certain that\r\n\nAhern was  the caller for  three reasons: she  recognized the\r\n\ncaller's  voice  as  Ahern's;  the caller  related  the  same\r\n\ninformation  in  his  calls to  Cate  and  to  Igoe; and  the\r\n\ninformation  related by the caller was known only to Cate and\r\n\nAhern.\r\n\n          While  at  Cate's  apartment,  McBride  listened to\r\n\nother recorded messages and  to a tape of calls  to Igoe that\r\n\nIgoe had recorded beginning  in February 1991.   McBride also\r\n\ncollected information from Cate  concerning the events of the\r\n\npast eighteen months.  Cate then made two tapes for McBride -\r\n\n-  one contained  obscene and  threatening messages  that had\r\n\nbeen left  on her answering machine,  including the September\r\n\n19th  message and  other  threats to  have  Igoe killed;  the\r\n\nsecond  tape was  a copy of  a tape  of phone  calls to Igoe,\r\n\nfeaturing graphic accounts of  the caller's sexual interludes\r\n\nwith Cate and various threats, including threats to have Igoe\r\n\nkilled.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n          Cate spoke to Igoe  that evening, while McBride was\r\n\nwith her, and learned  that he was fine.  McBride then called\r\n\nCaptain Philip O'Donnell, acting director of the UMB DPS, and\r\n\ntold  him  that  she  needed  him  to  listen  to  some  tape\r\n\nrecordings.   McBride  brought the  two tapes  to O'Donnell's\r\n\nhome.  After listening  to both tapes, O'Donnell agreed  that\r\n\nthe  caller  was  Ahern.   McBride  and  O'Donnell were  very\r\n\nfamiliar  with  Ahern's voice,  both  in  person  and on  the\r\n\ntelephone, from having  worked closely with him  on a regular\r\n\nbasis.   There is no  suggestion that either  officer, or any\r\n\nother defendant, bore any animosity toward Ahern. \r\n\n          Concerned about Ahern's potential dangerousness and\r\n\nthe  safety  of Cate  and  Igoe, O'Donnell  tried  to contact\r\n\nconsulting  psychologist Dr. Tonie  Moran in order  to get an\r\n\nexpert  opinion as to whether  or not the  caller presented a\r\n\nthreat to  Cate and Igoe, and  to ask her advice.   O'Donnell\r\n\nmade no attempt to  contact Cate, Igoe, Ahern, the  Union, or\r\n\nany  municipal police  department on  the night  of September\r\n\n19th.     He  did,   however,  question  McBride   about  the\r\n\nprecautions taken by  Cate for the remainder  of the evening,\r\n\nand  discussed with her the likelihood  that Ahern might pose\r\n\nan immediate danger.\r\n\n          On September  20, 1991, O'Donnell reported  to work\r\n\nat 7:00  a.m., the  time Ahern  came on duty.   He  had asked\r\n\nMcBride  to  report for  work early  as  well and  to monitor\r\n\nclosely Ahern's  whereabouts and activities.   O'Donnell  was\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nnot  concerned that  there was any  immediate danger  to Igoe\r\n\nbecause he knew that  Igoe lived in New Hampshire  and worked\r\n\nin Waltham.  O'Donnell thought it highly unlikely  that Ahern\r\n\nwould  drive  off campus  to  find Igoe,  because  that would\r\n\ncertainly have  resulted in disciplinary  action and possibly\r\n\nthe loss of Ahern's job.  As for Cate's safety, O'Donnell had\r\n\ninstructed McBride to tell her to stay off campus entirely if\r\n\nshe  could, and in  any case to  stay away from  the UMB boat\r\n\ndock where Cate worked.\r\n\n          Dr.   Moran   called  O'Donnell   at  approximately\r\n\n7:15 a.m.,  at which time  O'Donnell explained the situation,\r\n\ndescribing the contents  of the  tapes in as  much detail  as\r\n\npossible.   Based  upon what  O'Donnell told  her,  Dr. Moran\r\n\nadvised  him that the  caller might be  homicidal or suicidal\r\n\nand  therefore  should  be   evaluated  by  a  mental  health\r\n\nprofessional,   preferably  a   psychiatrist,  in   order  to\r\n\ndetermine  whether he posed  a danger to  himself or others.1\r\n\nShe  cautioned  O'Donnell that  Ahern's  career  as a  police\r\n\nofficer was  not necessarily  over  as a  consequence of  the\r\n\nevents  described;   that   with  intervention   and   proper\r\n\ntreatment,  it  was  possible  that things  could  return  to\r\n\nnormal, with no further problems.\r\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The record  contains contrary  accounts as to  what Dr.\r\nMoran told  O'Donnell to do  about the situation.   O'Donnell\r\nrecalled in his deposition and  elsewhere that Dr. Moran said\r\nthat Ahern should be taken for evaluation against his will if\r\nnecessary.  Dr. Moran, however, contends that she  never made\r\nthis  recommendation and that she played no part in the later\r\ndecision to admit Ahern to Arbour. \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\n          Dr. Moran  stated that  she  would not  be able  to\r\n\nexamine  Ahern  herself  that  day, but  offered  to  contact\r\n\nanother  doctor  with extensive  experience as  a psychiatric\r\n\nevaluator.  It  took several hours to make final arrangements\r\n\nfor an evaluation at Arbour,  largely due to difficulties  in\r\n\ndetermining  which  facilities would  be  covered by  Ahern's\r\n\nmedical  insurance  carrier.     During  the  same   morning,\r\n\nSeptember  20, O'Donnell  played  portions of  the tapes  for\r\n\nLieutenant  James Wise,  without giving  him any  information\r\n\nabout them, and asked if he could identify the caller.  Wise,\r\n\nwho had  been Ahern's  training officer,  and who  had worked\r\n\ndirectly with him  on a  daily basis for  two years,  replied\r\n\nthat the voice was Ahern's.     \r\n\n          Ahern reported for work at  his usual time of  7:00\r\n\na.m. and  was assigned an armed and uniformed post patrolling\r\n\nthe UMB campus in a marked police cruiser.  At  about 1:00 or\r\n\n1:30 p.m.,  O'Donnell  called him  back  to the  station  and\r\n\ninstructed him to  change into plain clothes,  put his weapon\r\n\naway, and meet O'Donnell in the DPS director's office.\r\n\n          When Ahern arrived, O'Donnell, McBride, and another\r\n\nfemale  officer were  present.   O'Donnell informed  him that\r\n\nCate had  made allegations against him  regarding obscene and\r\n\nthreatening phone calls to her and Igoe;  O'Donnell said that\r\n\nAhern was sick and needed help, and that O'Donnell wanted him\r\n\nto  undergo  a  psychiatric  evaluation.   Ahern  denied  the\r\n\nallegations.  \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n          According to  Ahern, he asked what  would happen if\r\n\nhe did  not agree to be  evaluated and was told  that he \"was\r\n\ngoing one way  or the other.\"  Ahern says  that at this point\r\n\nhe became  nervous and frightened; however,  he concedes that\r\n\nhe agreed  to go.  Ahern allegedly asked to speak to a lawyer\r\n\nor a  union representative, but O'Donnell  simply grabbed him\r\n\n\"like  a buddy\" and \"carted\" him out.  O'Donnell testified in\r\n\ndeposition,  however, that Ahern  was \"extremely cooperative\"\r\n\nand never gave any indication that he did not want to go with\r\n\nthe officers.  \r\n\n          When  they arrived  at Arbour,  O'Donnell explained\r\n\nthe situation to a staff member and, at some point, gave  the\r\n\ntapes to a staff member.  The officers stayed at the hospital\r\n\nuntil about 4:30 p.m., when they were informed that Ahern had\r\n\nrefused the  option of  applying for voluntary  admission and\r\n\nwas  being admitted  involuntarily.   Ahern  remained in  the\r\n\nhospital  for 12 days.   Cate received  several hang-up calls\r\n\nduring the time that Ahern was hospitalized.  She was told by\r\n\nan Arbour staff member  who had contacted her that  Ahern had\r\n\naccess to a pay phone.\r\n\n          Ahern was released from  Arbour on October 2, 1991.\r\n\nHis  discharge summary  listed  the reason  for discharge  as\r\n\nexpiration  of  the  ten-day period  authorized  by  statute.\r\n\nAfter his release, Cate  continued to get \"countless numbers\"\r\n\nof  harassing phone calls each day.  She continued to receive\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nsuch calls until she moved in the spring of 1992.   The calls\r\n\nto Igoe also continued, at least through the winter of 1991.\r\n\n          Ahern was placed on paid administrative leave as of\r\n\nSeptember 20, 1991, and was instructed in October 1991 to set\r\n\nup an appointment with  Dr. Moran so that she  could evaluate\r\n\nhis fitness  for duty.   They met in  November 1991,  and Dr.\r\n\nMoran  twice consulted  with the  attending  psychiatrist who\r\n\ntreated Ahern  at Arbour.   Dr. Moran  subsequently issued  a\r\n\nreport in  January 1992, in  which she expressed  her opinion\r\n\nthat Ahern could return to full duty on the condition that he\r\n\nengage in a one-year course of psychotherapy.\r\n\n          In  February 1992,  David  Cella, director  of DPS,\r\n\ninformed Ahern that the  DPS possessed evidence sufficient to\r\n\nwarrant  a finding  that Ahern  had placed  threatening phone\r\n\ncalls to  Cate and Igoe.   Cella stated  that, at a  minimum,\r\n\nAhern's actions constituted conduct unbecoming an officer and\r\n\nvery  likely  violated other  department regulations.   Cella\r\n\noffered  to permit  Ahern  to return  to  duty under  various\r\n\nconditions, including the inclusion  of a letter of reprimand\r\n\nin Ahern's file.  Ahern refused, on the ground that  it would\r\n\nconstitute an admission that he had made the calls.\r\n\n          After Ahern was provided extensive advice about his\r\n\nrights,  a hearing was held  in September 1992  as to Ahern's\r\n\ncontinued fitness  for duty.  Ahern apparently did not submit\r\n\na rebuttal case, and was terminated  from his employment with\r\n\nUMB  on October 2, 1992, for \"conduct unbecoming an officer.\"\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nA  Union grievance  resulted  in lengthy  hearings before  an\r\n\narbitrator  at which  the Union  and UMB  presented extensive\r\n\nevidence.   In January 1994,  the arbitrator  found that  the\r\n\nevidence  \"clearly and  convincingly\" established  that Ahern\r\n\nhad made the calls to  Cate and Igoe and that there  was just\r\n\ncause for termination.\r\n\n          Ahern subsequently  filed the  present action.   In\r\n\nits order  granting summary  judgment to the  defendants, the\r\n\ndistrict  court first found that Ahern had not been seized so\r\n\nas to implicate the Fourth Amendment because he had agreed to\r\n\ngo to Arbour for  psychiatric evaluation.  Alternatively, the\r\n\ndistrict court found that the officers had reasonably treated\r\n\nthe  situation  as  an  emergency creating  a  likelihood  of\r\n\nserious  harm   by  reason  of  mental   illness,  and  acted\r\n\nconsistently with Massachusetts law, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123,\r\n\n  12(a), and with  the Due Process  Clause of the  Fourteenth\r\n\nAmendment.\r\n\n          The  court also  ruled that  in any  case, the  UMB\r\n\ndefendants were  entitled to qualified immunity  and that, on\r\n\nthe state-law  claims, Dr.  Moran and  the UMB  officers were\r\n\nprotected  by Mass. Gen. Laws  ch. 123,   22.   This provides\r\n\nfor  immunity  from  civil  rights  suits  for,  inter  alia,\r                                                                        \r\n\nqualified psychologists and police  officers who act pursuant\r\n\nto  the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws  ch. 123. As to Ahern's\r\n\nclaims arising  from the  termination of his  employment, the\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\ndistrict court held  that UMB had  satisfied the due  process\r\n\nrequirements of notice and opportunity to be heard.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n                              A.\r                                          A.\r\n\n          On appeal,  Ahern contends that  the district court\r\n\nerred  in its  rulings  on three  issues:  (i) Ahern's  claim\r\n\nbrought under 42 U.S.C.   1983, alleging that his involuntary\r\n\nadmission  to Arbour  violated his  Fourth Amendment  and Due\r\n\nProcess Clause  rights; (ii) Ahern's section  1983 claim that\r\n\nthe  defendants deprived him of his right to due process with\r\n\nrespect to  his termination;  and (iii) the  district court's\r\n\nruling  that the  defendants were  entitled to  qualified and\r\n\nstatutory immunity.\r\n\n          Our review of the district court's grant of summary\r\n\njudgment is de novo.  See Wightman, 100 F.3d at 230.  Summary\r                                              \r\n\njudgment is proper if  the record materials \"show  that there\r\n\nis no  genuine issue as  to any  material fact  and that  the\r\n\nmoving party is entitled to  a judgment as a matter  of law.\"\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  After a thorough review of the record\r\n\nand  careful  consideration of  the  arguments presented,  we\r\n\nconclude that the district court's rulings were proper.\r\n\n                              B.\r                                          B.\r\n\n          We  begin   with   Ahern's  section   1983   claims\r\n\nconcerning his involuntary admission  to Arbour.  A plaintiff\r\n\nasserting  a cause of action under 42 U.S.C.   1983 must show\r\n\nthat the challenged conduct is attributable to a \"person\" who\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nacted  \"under color  of state  law,\" and  that it  caused the\r\n\nplaintiff to be deprived of rights, privileges, or immunities\r\n\nsecured by the United States Constitution or by  federal law.\r\n\nSee Soto  v. Flores, 103 F.3d 1056, 1061 (1st Cir. 1997).  By\r                               \r\n\nthe terms of the statute itself, a section 1983 claim must be\r\n\nbased  upon a federal right.  See Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n137, 144 n.3 (1979).\r\n\n          On appeal, Ahern argues  that the defendants failed\r\n\nto  comply  with   the  Massachusetts  involuntary  admission\r\n\nstatute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123,   12.2  Ahern cannot assert\r\n\na section 1983  cause of  action for violation  of the  state\r\n\nstatute,   see McKinney v. George, 726  F.2d 1183, 1188, 1190\r                                             \r\n\n(7th Cir. 1984); nor does Ahern claim that the statute itself\r\n\nis  unconstitutional   in   its  prescribed   standards   and\r\n\nprocedures  for   involuntary  admission  to   a  psychiatric\r\n\nfacility.   Still,  the  statutory provisions  may bear  upon\r\n\nanalysis of Ahern's Fourth  Amendment and due process rights.\r\n\n          We also note  at the outset  that any section  1983\r\n\nclaim  against  Dr. Moran  is doubtful.    She was  a private\r\n\npsychologist who occasionally consulted with the UMB DPS.  It\r\n\nis unclear that she was a state actor or acted under color of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Mass.  Gen.  Laws  ch.   123,    12(a)  refers  to  the\r\ninvoluntary  \"admission,\"  rather  than  \"commitment,\"  of an\r\nindividual for a period of ten days.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nstate law,3 and  even more  doubtful that she  can be  deemed\r\n\nresponsible for the admission.   But given our disposition of\r\n\nthe  underlying  constitutional claims,  we  need  not decide\r\n\nthese issues.\r\n\n          We examine in turn Ahern's Fourth Amendment and due\r\n\nprocess   arguments  with   respect  to  his   detention  and\r\n\ninvoluntary  admission.   We  focus  our  resolution of  this\r\n\nappeal on the constitutional questions presented, rather than\r\n\non the  qualified immunity defense,  in order to  clarify the\r\n\nrequirements of the Fourth  Amendment in this unique context.\r\n\n                              1.\r                                          1.\r\n\n          It  is now well-settled that the Fourth Amendment's\r\n\nprotections against unreasonable searches and  seizures apply\r\n\nto the involuntary hospitalization of persons for psychiatric\r\n\nreasons.   See McCabe v. Life-Line Ambulance  Serv., Inc., 77\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 540, 544 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S.  ---, 117 S.\r                                                  \r\n\nCt. 275 (1996).   The district court  rejected Ahern's Fourth\r\n\nAmendment argument,  based on its finding that  Ahern had not\r\n\nbeen  seized.    On  this  threshold  question,  we  adopt  a\r\n\ndifferent approach.\r\n\n          The Supreme Court has  explained that \"a person has\r\n\nbeen 'seized' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only\r\n\nif,  in view  of  all of  the  circumstances surrounding  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     3See,  e.g., Rockwell, 26 F.3d at 260; Pino v.

Ahern admits  that,\r\n\nduring the confrontation at the UMB DPS station, he agreed to\r\n\ngo  for an  evaluation.   Nevertheless,  Ahern contends  that\r\n\nO'Donnell and  McBride took him  to Arbour against  his will,\r\n\nthereby  seizing  him  for  Fourth Amendment  purposes.    In\r\n\nsupport  of  this claim,  Ahern  asserts  that O'Donnell  and\r\n\nMcBride told him  that he was  \"going one way or  the other,\"\r\n\nand that he  understood that to mean that if he did not go to\r\n\nthe hospital voluntarily, he would be taken by force.\r\n\n          The district  court ruled  that Ahern had  not been\r\n\nseized, based upon, inter alia, its conclusions that \"Ahern's\r                                          \r\n\nown evidence demonstrates that  despite his protestations  of\r\n\ninnocence, he  gave all  external indications  of voluntarily\r\n\nagreeing to submit  to an evaluation,\"  and that Ahern  never\r\n\n\"communicated that  he  had  changed  his  mind.\"    But  the\r\n\nquestion  seems  relatively close,  and  we  will assume  for\r\n\nargument's  sake that  the  facts  taken  in the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to  Ahern  establish  that  he  was  seized.    We\r\n\ntherefore ask whether the assumed seizure violated the Fourth\r\n\nAmendment.\r\n\n          To  determine  the  Fourth  Amendment  standard  of\r\n\nreasonableness that applies to the  defendants' actions, some\r\n\nbackground  explanation  is  in  order.    The  Massachusetts\r\n\nstatute provides four different categories of procedures  for\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n\nseeking the involuntary hospitalization  of an individual for\r\n\na ten-day  period.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123,   12.  The first\r\n\ntwo categories  permit a \"qualified  physician, psychologist,\r\n\nor  psychiatric nurse\"  to  sign a  \"pink paper\"  authorizing\r\n\nrestraint of  the  person, if  the signor  believes that  the\r\n\nperson would create a  \"likelihood of serious harm by  reason\r\n\nof mental illness.\"  McCabe,  77 F.3d at 547-48.   The fourth\r                                       \r\n\ncategory establishes  procedures for obtaining a  warrant for\r\n\nthe apprehension of persons  who are potentially dangerous by\r\n\nreason of mental illness.  See  id. at 548.  Ahern,  however,\r                                               \r\n\nwas detained  and transported to Arbour  under the \"category-\r\n\nthree\" procedure,  which does not  require the  signing of  a\r\n\nwarrant or pink paper.  This procedure provides:\r\n\n     In   an  emergency   situation,  if   a  physician,\r\n     qualified psychologist or qualified pediatric nurse\r\n     .  . .  is  not  available, a  police officer,  who\r\n     believes that failure to hospitalize a person would\r\n     create a  likelihood of  serious harm by  reason of\r\n     mental illness  may restrain such person  and apply\r\n     for the  hospitalization of  such person for  a ten\r\n     day period at [an authorized facility]. . . .\r\n\nMass.

Because a\r\n     seizure of a person  for an emergency mental health\r\n     evaluation   raises   concerns  that   are  closely\r\n     analogous to those implicated by a criminal arrest,\r\n     and both  are equally  intrusive, we  conclude that\r\n     the \"probable cause\" standard applies here . . . .\r\n\nPino, 75 F.3d at 1468.\r                \r\n\n          The   proper  inquiry  is  whether  probable  cause\r\n\nexisted at the moment the arrest was made, based on the facts\r\n\nand  circumstances within  the arresting  officer's knowledge\r\n\nand of which he had reasonably trustworthy information.

Here, then, probable cause\r                   \r\n\nexisted if, at the moment Ahern was \"seized\"  for evaluation,\r\n\nthe facts  and circumstances  reasonably believed by  the UMB\r\n\nofficers indicated  that Ahern  presented a likely  threat of\r\n\nserious  harm to  himself  or  others  by  reason  of  mental\r\n\nillness.  See Chathas v.  Smith, 884 F.2d 980, 987  (7th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1989).\r\n\n          Applying this standard, we find that the undisputed\r\n\nevidence demonstrates that the officers had probable cause to\r\n\nbelieve that Ahern made the calls to Cate and Igoe, and that,\r\n\nin  view of  the  content  of  the  tapes  and  Ahern's  past\r\n\nbehavior, Ahern  needed to  be evaluated  by a mental  health\r\n\nprofessional  as  soon  as  possible in  order  to  determine\r\n\nwhether he  might be dangerous  by reason of  mental illness.\r\n\nMoreover, the belief that Ahern might be dangerous was shared\r\n\nby Dr.  Moran, a qualified psychologist,  and corroborated by\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\r\n\nDr.  Malick,  a  licensed   physician,  who  concluded  after\r\n\nconducting his own examination  that Ahern should be admitted\r\n\nto Arbour.\r\n\n          In response, Ahern  claims that the UMB DPS knew of\r\n\nand was  investigating Cate's allegations  against him before\r\n\nthe September  19th call.   The record contains  some support\r\n\nfor  this claim, in the form of deposition testimony of other\r\n\nUMB  officers.   Nevertheless,  we  agree  with the  district\r\n\ncourt's  conclusion that  \"even  if there  were some  earlier\r\n\ninvestigation, the  complaint by Cate on  September 19, 1991,\r\n\nwas  adequate  to  trigger  an 'emergency'  response  by  the\r\n\ndepartment\" because  the September 19th  call \"represented  a\r\n\nchange from threats to do harm, to a representation that harm\r\n\nhad been done.\" \r\n\n          Ahern  next  says  that the  defendants'  delay  in\r\n\nacting upon the September 19th call  negates the existence of\r\n\nan  emergency  warranting a  unilateral seizure  without more\r\n\nelaborate procedural safeguards.   Cf. McCabe, 77 F.3d at 550\r                                                         \r\n\nn.10.  Ahern places  great emphasis on the time  that elapsed\r\n\nbetween  his  return  to  the station  on  the  afternoon  of\r\n\nSeptember 20th and  both (i) the recording  by Cate's machine\r\n\nof  the September 19th message (about 37 hours), and (ii) the\r\n\ntime that the UMB  officers formed the belief that  Ahern was\r\n\nthe  caller (about 18 hours).  Indeed, during the morning and\r\n\nearly afternoon of September 20th, O'Donnell  permitted Ahern\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                         -22-\r\r\n\nto patrol the UMB campus armed with a gun in  a marked patrol\r\n\ncar.\r\n\n          This argument is  not without force; in  hindsight,\r\n\nsome of O'Donnell's actions  are equivocal.  Nonetheless, the\r\n\nobjective facts  known to the  defendants clearly demonstrate\r\n\nthat a reasonable person would have believed that Ahern posed\r\n\na \"likelihood of  serious harm by  reason of mental  illness\"\r\n\nand to  believe that  Ahern's continued presence  in the  UMB\r\n\ncommunity constituted  an \"emergency.\"  The  speed with which\r\n\nan emergent  problem is resolved is  not itself determinative\r\n\nof the existence vel non of an emergency.   We agree with the\r                                    \r\n\ndistrict court that the undisputed facts show that  the delay\r\n\n\"resulted largely  from an effort to  take appropriate action\r\n\nin a safe and measured manner.\"\r\n\n          Ahern  further suggests  that the  defendants could\r\n\nnot reasonably have  viewed him as  dangerous because he  did\r\n\nnot engage in  dangerous behavior between the phone  call and\r\n\nhis seizure, and  also because he displayed  no visible signs\r\n\nof  mental   illness  while  in   the  defendants'  presence.\r\n\nProbable cause  in this  context, however, requires  only the\r\n\nlikelihood of dangerous activity  -- Ahern's threat,  coupled\r                      \r\n\nwith  his  history  of  harassment,  threats,  and  stalking,\r\n\nsufficed  to show  that  failure to  hospitalize Ahern  would\r\n\ncreate some danger of serious physical harm.  \r\n\n          Finally,  the summary judgment materials contain no\r\n\nsupport for Ahern's allegation that the defendants gave false\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                         -23-\r\r\n\nor misleading  information to Dr. Malick  that suggested that\r\n\nAhern might  be suicidal.   Dr. Malick's notes  contained the\r\n\nremarks,  \"apparently  suicidal   threats  today\"  and  \"told\r\n\npsychiatrist he planned to  kill self too.\"  Ahern  says that\r\n\nhe  never made such comments  to Dr. Malick.   This evidence,\r\n\nhowever,  is simply  too  insubstantial to  create a  genuine\r\n\ndispute of material fact.  \r\n\n          Our  conclusion is  not  altered by  the fact  that\r\n\nAhern denied making  the phone calls  or by the fact  that he\r\n\nwas ultimately released from Arbour without a finding that he\r\n\ncontinued to pose a  threat to himself or others.   \"If there\r\n\nis  probable cause, it is irrelevant if the suspect turns out\r\n\nto be noncommitable.   The arrest is still legal.\"   Chathas,\r                                                                        \r\n\n884  F.2d at  987; see Baker  v.

We  conclude that there  is no trialworthy\r\n\nissue  as to the Fourth Amendment claim; the seizure, if such\r\n\nthere was, was lawful under the Fourth Amendment.   \r\n\n                              2.\r                                          2.\r\n\n          The  district court dealt  extensively with Ahern's\r\n\nvarious theories of due process violations in connection with\r\n\nhis involuntary admission  to Arbour.   On appeal, Ahern  has\r\n\nnot attempted to articulate  any due process theory entitling\r\n\nhim to  relief, but  has simply  argued  that the  defendants\r\n\nlacked authority to use the category-three  procedure because\r\n\nno emergency  existed, and  that a warrant  should have  been\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                         -24-\r\r\n\nobtained under the \"category-four\" procedure, Mass. Gen. Laws\r\n\nch. 123,   12(e).   We therefore treat his  other allegations\r\n\nof  due process violations, raised in  the district court, as\r\n\nwaived.\r\n\n          In  this context,  the Fourth  Amendment protection\r\n\nagainst  unreasonable seizures  more specifically  applies to\r\n\nthe complained-of  conduct than does the  Due Process Clause,\r\n\nand thus  defines what process is  due in the context  of the\r\n\nspecific   conduct   alleged   to   have   violated   Ahern's\r\n\nconstitutional rights.

We have  already explained, in\r                    \r\n\ndiscussing  the  Fourth Amendment  point,  that the  evidence\r\n\nwarranted the police in believing that an \"emergency\" existed\r\n\nby  virtue of the real possibility that Ahern might harm Igoe\r\n\nor Cate.\r\n\n                              C.\r                                          C.\r\n\n          Ahern also  raises  a separate  due process  claim,\r\n\narguing that  he was deprived due process  in the proceedings\r\n\nleading to  the termination of his job.   There is no dispute\r\n\nthat   Ahern  enjoyed   constitutional  protections   in  his\r\n\ncontinued  employment with the UMB DPS.  See Cleveland Bd. of\r                                                                         \r\n\nEduc.  v. Loudermill, 470 U.S.  532 (1985).   In the district\r                                \r\n\ncourt, he  made several  arguments to  this  effect, but  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  correctly  rejected  his  challenges to  the\r\n\nadequacy of the  notice and opportunity to be  heard afforded\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                         -25-\r\r\n\nhim prior to  his termination.   On appeal  Ahern has  waived\r\n\nthese arguments.\r\n\n          Ahern's  only  argument on  appeal with  respect to\r\n\nthis due process  claim is that the UMB defendants \"destroyed\r\n\nand  manipulated evidence in  bad faith.\"   In particular, he\r\n\nclaims that  the UMB defendants concealed or destroyed a tape\r\n\nrecording  of an  interview with  Igoe conducted  by McBride;\r\n\nthis  would  have  proved  relevant  and  exculpatory,  Ahern\r\n\nargues,  by  showing that  Igoe  thought  that two  different\r\n\npeople  had made the threatening  phone calls to  him.  Ahern\r\n\nalso claims that the defendants used a  log of the calls made\r\n\nto  Igoe that was prepared by McBride, rather than Igoe's own\r\n\nactual  log of calls.   According to Ahern, McBride's version\r\n\nwas incomplete and Ahern was  thus prejudiced in his  ability\r\n\nto show that some of the calls were not made by him.  \r\n\n          We readily  reject Ahern's  argument.  There  is no\r\n\nevidence that witnesses  were unavailable for examination  by\r\n\nAhern prior  to his termination hearing;  Ahern could readily\r\n\nhave   adduced   the   allegedly-concealed   information   by\r\n\nquestioning  Igoe  and  McBride.   Likewise,  he  could  have\r\n\ndiscovered  UMB's  alleged  destruction and  manipulation  of\r\n\nevidence by examining Igoe,  who would have had no  reason to\r\n\nlie at the pretermination hearing, and who  later admitted in\r\n\ndeposition that  he believed  that two different  people made\r\n\nthe threatening phone calls.  Furthermore, it appears that at\r\n\nmost, the  destroyed evidence would have  shown the existence\r\n\n                             -26-\r                                         -26-\r\r\n\nof  a second  caller;  Ahern  never  suggests that  with  the\r\n\nadditional evidence he would  have been able to show  that he\r\n\nnever made the harassing and threatening calls.  We note that\r\n\nAhern was afforded a  three-day hearing before an independent\r\n\narbitrator, who  concluded after reviewing  the \"plethora  of\r\n\nevidence\"   presented  by  both  parties  that  the  evidence\r\n\n\"clearly and  convincingly\" established  that Ahern made  the\r\n\ncalls  to Cate and Igoe.   In these  circumstances, we cannot\r\n\nsay that Ahern was  denied a fair opportunity to  contest his\r\n\ntermination.  \r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r\n\n          We need only  add a  brief word on  the subject  of\r\n\nqualified immunity.  The district court found that the law at\r\n\nthe time of Ahern's involuntary admission to  Arbour \"did not\r\n\nclearly identify  that O'Donnell and McBride's  actions might\r\n\nviolate  the Constitution.\"   See  Harlow v.  Fitzgerald, 457\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  800, 818 (1982).   On appeal, Ahern's  sole argument on\r\n\nthis issue is that the  disposition of the qualified immunity\r\n\nquestion before the resolution of alleged factual disputes is\r\n\npremature.  \r\n\n          We disagree.   The question whether  a defendant is\r\n\nentitled,  on  a given  set of  facts,  to the  protection of\r\n\nqualified  immunity  is  a  question of  law.    See Elder v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nHolloway,  510 U.S. 510, 516 (1994); Wood v.

Laws ch. 123,   22.  This section creates immunity from\r\n\ncivil  suits for  physicians,  qualified  psychologists,  and\r\n\npolice  officers  who act  \"pursuant  to  the provisions\"  of\r\n\nchapter 123.   Because we  have already  determined that  the\r\n\nofficers  acted in  conformance with  the statute,  they were\r\n\nentitled to  immunity under  this provision on  the state-law\r\n\nclaims.  Dr. Moran  similarly acted within the bounds  of the\r\n\nstatute,  to  the extent  that  she was  responsible  for the\r\n\ndecision to detain and transport Ahern to Arbour.

Ahern brought suit in federal court against five individuals and three entities, seeking declaratory relief and damages for a variety of civil rights violations and common-law torts.  The complaint alleged that the defendants violated Ahern's rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and asserted pendent state-law claims for, inter alia, false arrest, false imprisonment, and infliction of emotional distress.  The claims were based upon events that resulted in Ahern's involuntary admission to a psychiatric facility and the subsequent termination of his employment as a police officer with the University of Massachusetts at Boston (\"UMB\") Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint named as defendants, in both their individual and official capacities, Captain Philip O'Donnell, acting director of the UMB DPS at the time of Ahern's involuntary admission to the Arbour Hospital (\"Arbour\");  David Cella, director of the UMB DPS at the time Ahern's employment was terminated;  Sergeant Patricia McBride of the UMB police force;  Dr. Tonie Moran, consulting psychologist to the UMB DPS;  and Dr. Michael Malick, the physician who evaluated Ahern at Arbour and who effected his involuntary admission to that facility.  The three entities named as defendants were UMB, Arbour, and Ahern's union, the UMB Patrolmen's Association (\"the Union\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following dismissal of the counts against the Union and Dr. Malick, the remaining parties filed cross motions for summary judgment.  The district court entered summary judgment for the defendants on all counts.  Ahern now appeals from that portion of the district court's order entering summary judgment in favor of Dr. Moran and the UMB defendants.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We view the record evidence in the light most favorable to Ahern, the party against whom summary judgment has entered, drawing all reasonable competing inferences in his favor.  See Wightman v. Springfield Terminal Ry. Co., 100 F.3d 228, 230 (1st Cir.1996).  Most of the predicate facts are not in dispute, although Ahern strenuously disputes the significance of some of the facts.  The salient events are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning of September 19, 1991, shortly after midnight, Deborah Cate's telephone answering machine recorded the following message:  \"Hey.  Guess what?   We took care of that crybaby old fuck of yours.  The niggers splattered his face all over Dorchester.  He's gone.  He's gone.  That fucking crybaby's all gone.\"   Ms. Cate, a UMB student and employee, was not at home at the time of the call and did not hear the message until approximately 6:15 that evening.  Cate recognized the voice as that of Ahern, a former boyfriend, and understood the message to mean that Ahern had caused James Igoe, another of Cate's former boyfriends, to be killed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the September 19th message, Ahern had been a member of the UMB police force for approximately four years.  Cate had dated and become intimate with Ahern during the spring and summer of 1990.  Before, during, and after that same period, Cate also dated James Igoe, who was married and had children.  At the time these relationships were going on concurrently, Ahern knew of Cate's relationship with Igoe.  Ahern also knew where Igoe worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cate dated Ahern through the Fourth of July weekend of 1990, at which time she told him that she wanted to end their relationship.  Ahern was upset by this and for the remainder of the summer of 1990 he attempted to convince Cate to resume the relationship.  According to Cate, he constantly stopped by uninvited to her workplace, interrupting her work, giving her unwanted gifts, and upsetting her.  Ahern repeatedly told Cate that he hated Igoe;  that if it were not for Igoe, Cate would love Ahern;  and that he would \"take care of\" Igoe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern began a campaign of telephone calls to Cate in which he threatened, among other things, to tell Igoe's wife and children of the relationship between Cate and Igoe, and to send Igoe's wife photographs of Cate and Igoe together.  In mid-August 1990, Ahern told Cate that he had obtained Igoe's home address from the UMB police computer and that he was going to go there to tell Igoe's wife and children about Igoe's affair with Cate.  Ahern also stalked Cate and called her to let her know that he had been following her.  On one occasion, Ahern called Cate while Igoe was visiting at her apartment.  When Cate answered the phone, Ahern said, \"He's there, isn't he?\" and told her to look out the window.  When she did, she saw Ahern in a phone booth across the street from her house, looking up at her and displaying what appeared to her to be a gun.  Ahern does not dispute these allegations but states that by the fall of 1990 he had ceased his efforts to convince Cate to return to him and had begun dating another woman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in the summer of 1990, after she ended her relationship with Ahern, Cate also began to receive obscene and threatening phone calls.  In late September or October 1990, Igoe began to receive harassing and threatening calls at work.  In the calls to Igoe, a male caller referred to an unnamed woman with whom the caller and Igoe both had relationships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sexually explicit calls to Cate and Igoe continued through March 1991.  Ahern denied making the calls, though he admitted that he had been \"a little crazy\" over his break-up with Cate.  In mid-March, Cate told Ahern that Igoe was still receiving harassing calls and that she believed that he was the caller.  According to Cate, Ahern became nervous and suggested that the caller might be a friend of his who was upset with Cate and Igoe for the way they had treated Ahern.  In April 1991, Cate received another sexually explicit message, the content of which was the same as a message left in January.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early July 1991, against Igoe's wishes, Cate ended their relationship.  In mid-July, Igoe received another call, in the course of which he exclaimed, \"Look, you got what you wanted.  You split Debi and I up.\"   At the end of July, Cate received more threatening, sexually explicit messages.  She was certain that the caller was Ahern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1991, Cate reported the obscene and threatening phone calls to the Boston Police Department, but did not supply any information about the suspected caller.  She also contacted the telephone company, which placed a \"trap\" on her phone for three weeks.  The telephone company then advised Cate that the calls she reported during the three-week period were made from local telephone booths, some from the MBTA station near UMB.  Cate continued to receive hang-up calls after the trap was removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After listening to the September 19th message, Cate became frightened and concerned for Igoe's safety because she thought that the message could be \"the real thing.\"   She called Igoe at work, at home, and at his wife's home, but was unable to reach him.  Panicked, she called the Boston Police Department.  She told a detective about the message and asked if any serious incidents had been reported that day.  The detective ultimately recommended that Cate call Patricia McBride, a sergeant on the UMB police force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 6:30 p.m., Cate called McBride to report the threatening and harassing phone calls.  McBride offered to interview Cate at her apartment, rather than at the DPS station, because the complaint involved a fellow officer.  At Cate's apartment, Cate suggested that McBride listen to the disturbing message herself.  After listening for a short time, McBride was convinced that the caller was Ahern.  Cate then told McBride that she was certain that Ahern was the caller for three reasons:  she recognized the caller's voice as Ahern's;  the caller related the same information in his calls to Cate and to Igoe;  and the information related by the caller was known only to Cate and Ahern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While at Cate's apartment, McBride listened to other recorded messages and to a tape of calls to Igoe that Igoe had recorded beginning in February 1991.  McBride also collected information from Cate concerning the events of the past eighteen months.  Cate then made two tapes for McBride--one contained obscene and threatening messages that had been left on her answering machine, including the September 19th message and other threats to have Igoe killed;  the second tape was a copy of a tape of phone calls to Igoe, featuring graphic accounts of the caller's sexual interludes with Cate and various threats, including threats to have Igoe killed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cate spoke to Igoe that evening, while McBride was with her, and learned that he was fine.  McBride then called Captain Philip O'Donnell, acting director of the UMB DPS, and told him that she needed him to listen to some tape recordings.  McBride brought the two tapes to O'Donnell's home.  After listening to both tapes, O'Donnell agreed that the caller was Ahern.  McBride and O'Donnell were very familiar with Ahern's voice, both in person and on the telephone, from having worked closely with him on a regular basis.  There is no suggestion that either officer, or any other defendant, bore any animosity toward Ahern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned about Ahern's potential dangerousness and the safety of Cate and Igoe, O'Donnell tried to contact consulting psychologist Dr. Tonie Moran in order to get an expert opinion as to whether or not the caller presented a threat to Cate and Igoe, and to ask her advice.  O'Donnell made no attempt to contact Cate, Igoe, Ahern, the Union, or any municipal police department on the night of September 19th.  He did, however, question McBride about the precautions taken by Cate for the remainder of the evening, and discussed with her the likelihood that Ahern might pose an immediate danger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, 1991, O'Donnell reported to work at 7:00 a.m., the time Ahern came on duty.  He had asked McBride to report for work early as well and to monitor closely Ahern's whereabouts and activities.  O'Donnell was not concerned that there was any immediate danger to Igoe because he knew that Igoe lived in New Hampshire and worked in Waltham.  O'Donnell thought it highly unlikely that Ahern would drive off campus to find Igoe, because that would certainly have resulted in disciplinary action and possibly the loss of Ahern's job.  As for Cate's safety, O'Donnell had instructed McBride to tell her to stay off campus entirely if she could, and in any case to stay away from the UMB boat dock where Cate worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Moran called O'Donnell at approximately 7:15 a.m., at which time O'Donnell explained the situation, describing the contents of the tapes in as much detail as possible.  Based upon what O'Donnell told her, Dr. Moran advised him that the caller might be homicidal or suicidal and therefore should be evaluated by a mental health professional, preferably a psychiatrist, in order to determine whether he posed a danger to himself or others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  She cautioned O'Donnell that Ahern's career as a police officer was not necessarily over as a consequence of the events described;  that with intervention and proper treatment, it was possible that things could return to normal, with no further problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Moran stated that she would not be able to examine Ahern herself that day, but offered to contact another doctor with extensive experience as a psychiatric evaluator.  It took several hours to make final arrangements for an evaluation at Arbour, largely due to difficulties in determining which facilities would be covered by Ahern's medical insurance carrier.  During the same morning, September 20, O'Donnell played portions of the tapes for Lieutenant James Wise, without giving him any information about them, and asked if he could identify the caller.  Wise, who had been Ahern's training officer, and who had worked directly with him on a daily basis for two years, replied that the voice was Ahern's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern reported for work at his usual time of 7:00 a.m.  and was assigned an armed and uniformed post patrolling the UMB campus in a marked police cruiser.  At about 1:00 or 1:30 p.m., O'Donnell called him back to the station and instructed him to change into plain clothes, put his weapon away, and meet O'Donnell in the DPS director's office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Ahern arrived, O'Donnell, McBride, and another female officer were present.  O'Donnell informed him that Cate had made allegations against him regarding obscene and threatening phone calls to her and Igoe;  O'Donnell said that Ahern was sick and needed help, and that O'Donnell wanted him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.  Ahern denied the allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Ahern, he asked what would happen if he did not agree to be evaluated and was told that he \"was going one way or the other.\"   Ahern says that at this point he became nervous and frightened;  however, he concedes that he agreed to go.  Ahern allegedly asked to speak to a lawyer or a union representative, but O'Donnell simply grabbed him \"like a buddy\" and \"carted\" him out.  O'Donnell testified in deposition, however, that Ahern was \"extremely cooperative\" and never gave any indication that he did not want to go with the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When they arrived at Arbour, O'Donnell explained the situation to a staff member and, at some point, gave the tapes to a staff member.  The officers stayed at the hospital until about 4:30 p.m., when they were informed that Ahern had refused the option of applying for voluntary admission and was being admitted involuntarily.  Ahern remained in the hospital for 12 days.  Cate received several hang-up calls during the time that Ahern was hospitalized.  She was told by an Arbour staff member who had contacted her that Ahern had access to a pay phone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern was released from Arbour on October 2, 1991.  His discharge summary listed the reason for discharge as expiration of the ten-day period authorized by statute.  After his release, Cate continued to get \"countless numbers\" of harassing phone calls each day.  She continued to receive such calls until she moved in the spring of 1992.  The calls to Igoe also continued, at least through the winter of 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern was placed on paid administrative leave as of September 20, 1991, and was instructed in October 1991 to set up an appointment with Dr. Moran so that she could evaluate his fitness for duty.  They met in November 1991, and Dr. Moran twice consulted with the attending psychiatrist who treated Ahern at Arbour.  Dr. Moran subsequently issued a report in January 1992, in which she expressed her opinion that Ahern could return to full duty on the condition that he engage in a one-year course of psychotherapy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1992, David Cella, director of DPS, informed Ahern that the DPS possessed evidence sufficient to warrant a finding that Ahern had placed threatening phone calls to Cate and Igoe.  Cella stated that, at a minimum, Ahern's actions constituted conduct unbecoming an officer and very likely violated other department regulations.  Cella offered to permit Ahern to return to duty under various conditions, including the inclusion of a letter of reprimand in Ahern's file.  Ahern refused, on the ground that it would constitute an admission that he had made the calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Ahern was provided extensive advice about his rights, a hearing was held in September 1992 as to Ahern's continued fitness for duty.  Ahern apparently did not submit a rebuttal case, and was terminated from his employment with UMB on October 2, 1992, for \"conduct unbecoming an officer.\"   A Union grievance resulted in lengthy hearings before an arbitrator at which the Union and UMB presented extensive evidence.  In January 1994, the arbitrator found that the evidence \"clearly and convincingly\" established that Ahern had made the calls to Cate and Igoe and that there was just cause for termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern subsequently filed the present action.  In its order granting summary judgment to the defendants, the district court first found that Ahern had not been seized so as to implicate the Fourth Amendment because he had agreed to go to Arbour for psychiatric evaluation.  Alternatively, the district court found that the officers had reasonably treated the situation as an emergency creating a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness, and acted consistently with Massachusetts law, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), and with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also ruled that in any case, the UMB defendants were entitled to qualified immunity and that, on the state-law claims, Dr. Moran and the UMB officers were protected by Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 22.  This provides for immunity from civil rights suits for, inter alia, qualified psychologists and police officers who act pursuant to the provisions of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123.  As to Ahern's claims arising from the termination of his employment, the district court held that UMB had satisfied the due process requirements of notice and opportunity to be heard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ahern contends that the district court erred in its rulings on three issues:  (i) Ahern's claim brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleging that his involuntary admission to Arbour violated his Fourth Amendment and Due Process Clause rights;  (ii) Ahern's section 1983 claim that the defendants deprived him of his right to due process with respect to his termination;  and (iii) the district court's ruling that the defendants were entitled to qualified and statutory immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is de novo.  See Wightman, 100 F.3d at 230.   Summary judgment is proper if the record materials \"show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  After a thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the arguments presented, we conclude that the district court's rulings were proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Ahern's section 1983 claims concerning his involuntary admission to Arbour.  A plaintiff asserting a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 must show that the challenged conduct is attributable to a \"person\" who acted \"under color of state law,\" and that it caused the plaintiff to be deprived of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the United States Constitution or by federal law.  See Soto v. Flores, 103 F.3d 1056, 1061 (1st Cir.1997).  By the terms of the statute itself, a section 1983 claim must be based upon a federal right.  See Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. 137, 144 n. 3, 99 S.Ct. 2689, 2694-95 n. 3, 61 L.Ed.2d 433 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ahern argues that the defendants failed to comply with the Massachusetts involuntary admission statute, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 12.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Ahern cannot assert a section 1983 cause of action for violation of the state statute, see McKinney v. George, 726 F.2d 1183, 1188, 1190 (7th Cir.1984);  nor does Ahern claim that the statute itself is unconstitutional in its prescribed standards and procedures for involuntary admission to a psychiatric facility.  Still, the statutory provisions may bear upon analysis of Ahern's Fourth Amendment and due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note at the outset that any section 1983 claim against Dr. Moran is doubtful.  She was a private psychologist who occasionally consulted with the UMB DPS. It is unclear that she was a state actor or acted under color of state law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and even more doubtful that she can be deemed responsible for the admission.  But given our disposition of the underlying constitutional claims, we need not decide these issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine in turn Ahern's Fourth Amendment and due process arguments with respect to his detention and involuntary admission.  We focus our resolution of this appeal on the constitutional questions presented, rather than on the qualified immunity defense, in order to clarify the requirements of the Fourth Amendment in this unique context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is now well-settled that the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures apply to the involuntary hospitalization of persons for psychiatric reasons.  See McCabe v. Life-Line Ambulance Serv., Inc., 77 F.3d 540, 544 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 275, 136 L.Ed.2d 198 (1996).  The district court rejected Ahern's Fourth Amendment argument, based on its finding that Ahern had not been seized.  On this threshold question, we adopt a different approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has explained that \"a person has been 'seized' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\"  United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (footnote omitted).  Ahern admits that, during the confrontation at the UMB DPS station, he agreed to go for an evaluation.  Nevertheless, Ahern contends that O'Donnell and McBride took him to Arbour against his will, thereby seizing him for Fourth Amendment purposes.  In support of this claim, Ahern asserts that O'Donnell and McBride told him that he was \"going one way or the other,\" and that he understood that to mean that if he did not go to the hospital voluntarily, he would be taken by force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Ahern had not been seized, based upon, inter alia, its conclusions that \"Ahern's own evidence demonstrates that despite his protestations of innocence, he gave all external indications of voluntarily agreeing to submit to an evaluation,\" and that Ahern never \"communicated that he had changed his mind.\"   But the question seems relatively close, and we will assume for argument's sake that the facts taken in the light most favorable to Ahern establish that he was seized.  We therefore ask whether the assumed seizure violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that applies to the defendants' actions, some background explanation is in order.  The Massachusetts statute provides four different categories of procedures for seeking the involuntary hospitalization of an individual for a ten-day period.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 12.  The first two categories permit a \"qualified physician, psychologist, or psychiatric nurse\" to sign a \"pink paper\" authorizing restraint of the person, if the signor believes that the person would create a \"likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness.\"  McCabe, 77 F.3d at 547-48.   The fourth category establishes procedures for obtaining a warrant for the apprehension of persons who are potentially dangerous by reason of mental illness.  See id. at 548.   Ahern, however, was detained and transported to Arbour under the \"category-three\" procedure, which does not require the signing of a warrant or pink paper.  This procedure provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>In an emergency situation, if a physician, qualified psychologist or qualified pediatric nurse ... is not available, a police officer, who believes that failure to hospitalize a person would create a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness may restrain such person and apply for the hospitalization of such person for a ten day period at [an authorized facility]....</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 12(a).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A nonconsensual search or seizure is unreasonable in the absence of a judicial warrant issued upon probable cause.  See Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Ass'n, 489 U.S. 602, 619, 109 S.Ct. 1402, 1414, 103 L.Ed.2d 639 (1989).  But \"[t]he ultimate standard set forth in the Fourth Amendment is reasonableness,\" Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U.S. 433, 439, 93 S.Ct. 2523, 2527, 37 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973), under \"all of the circumstances,\" United States v. Montoya de Hernandez, 473 U.S. 531, 537, 105 S.Ct. 3304, 3308, 87 L.Ed.2d 381 (1985).  \"[A]lthough both the concept of probable cause and the requirement of a warrant bear on the reasonableness of a search, ... in certain limited circumstances neither is required.\"  New Jersey v. T.L.O., 469 U.S. 325, 340, 105 S.Ct. 733, 742, 83 L.Ed.2d 720 (1985) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has recognized a particular exception to the warrant and probable-cause requirements in cases involving \"special needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement.\"  Griffin v. Wisconsin, 483 U.S. 868, 873, 107 S.Ct. 3164, 3168, 97 L.Ed.2d 709 (1987) (citation omitted).  In McCabe, 77 F.3d 540, we applied the special needs exception to a Fourth Amendment challenge to a municipal policy permitting forcible, warrantless entries into private homes for the purpose of executing pink papers.  In that case, a pink paper had been issued pursuant to the category-two procedure of the Massachusetts statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCabe did not directly resolve the question before us here.  Under the category-two procedure, police officers act upon a determination made by a qualified physician, psychologist, or psychiatric nurse, albeit without benefit of an examination, and McCabe emphasized \"the presence of a search authorization by an impartial, or at least a relatively impartial person.\"  77 F.3d at 552.   Under the category-three procedure, however, police officers make the decision whether to \"seize\" the person themselves without necessarily securing expert advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, we are arguably dealing with a police officer's own decision--rather than that of an impartial expert--we think that Fourth Amendment standards require a showing of probable cause;  that is, circumstances warranting a reasonable belief that the person to be seized does (as outlined in the statute) have a mental health condition threatening serious harm to himself or others.  Other circuits have so held,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and involuntary hospitalization is no less a loss of liberty than an arrest.  We agree with the Tenth Circuit that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>The state has a legitimate interest in protecting the community from the mentally ill and in protecting a mentally ill person from self-harm.  A person suspected of mental illness possesses a right to liberty and a right to freedom from unfounded charges of mental infirmity.  Because a seizure of a person for an emergency mental health evaluation raises concerns that are closely analogous to those implicated by a criminal arrest, and both are equally intrusive, we conclude that the \"probable cause\" standard applies here....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pino, 75 F.3d at 1468.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proper inquiry is whether probable cause existed at the moment the arrest was made, based on the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer's knowledge and of which he had reasonably trustworthy information.  Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225-26, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964).  Here, then, probable cause existed if, at the moment Ahern was \"seized\" for evaluation, the facts and circumstances reasonably believed by the UMB officers indicated that Ahern presented a likely threat of serious harm to himself or others by reason of mental illness.  See Chathas v. Smith, 884 F.2d 980, 987 (7th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this standard, we find that the undisputed evidence demonstrates that the officers had probable cause to believe that Ahern made the calls to Cate and Igoe, and that, in view of the content of the tapes and Ahern's past behavior, Ahern needed to be evaluated by a mental health professional as soon as possible in order to determine whether he might be dangerous by reason of mental illness.  Moreover, the belief that Ahern might be dangerous was shared by Dr. Moran, a qualified psychologist, and corroborated by Dr. Malick, a licensed physician, who concluded after conducting his own examination that Ahern should be admitted to Arbour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Ahern claims that the UMB DPS knew of and was investigating Cate's allegations against him before the September 19th call.  The record contains some support for this claim, in the form of deposition testimony of other UMB officers.  Nevertheless, we agree with the district court's conclusion that \"even if there were some earlier investigation, the complaint by Cate on September 19, 1991, was adequate to trigger an 'emergency' response by the department\" because the September 19th call \"represented a change from threats to do harm, to a representation that harm had been done.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern next says that the defendants' delay in acting upon the September 19th call negates the existence of an emergency warranting a unilateral seizure without more elaborate procedural safeguards.  Cf. McCabe, 77 F.3d at 550 n. 10.  Ahern places great emphasis on the time that elapsed between his return to the station on the afternoon of September 20th and both (i) the recording by Cate's machine of the September 19th message (about 37 hours), and (ii) the time that the UMB officers formed the belief that Ahern was the caller (about 18 hours).  Indeed, during the morning and early afternoon of September 20th, O'Donnell permitted Ahern to patrol the UMB campus armed with a gun in a marked patrol car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is not without force;  in hindsight, some of O'Donnell's actions are equivocal.  Nonetheless, the objective facts known to the defendants clearly demonstrate that a reasonable person would have believed that Ahern posed a \"likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness\" and to believe that Ahern's continued presence in the UMB community constituted an \"emergency.\"   The speed with which an emergent problem is resolved is not itself determinative of the existence vel non of an emergency.  We agree with the district court that the undisputed facts show that the delay \"resulted largely from an effort to take appropriate action in a safe and measured manner.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern further suggests that the defendants could not reasonably have viewed him as dangerous because he did not engage in dangerous behavior between the phone call and his seizure, and also because he displayed no visible signs of mental illness while in the defendants' presence.  Probable cause in this context, however, requires only the likelihood of dangerous activity--Ahern's threat, coupled with his history of harassment, threats, and stalking, sufficed to show that failure to hospitalize Ahern would create some danger of serious physical harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the summary judgment materials contain no support for Ahern's allegation that the defendants gave false or misleading information to Dr. Malick that suggested that Ahern might be suicidal.  Dr. Malick's notes contained the remarks, \"apparently suicidal threats today\" and \"told psychiatrist he planned to kill self too.\"   Ahern says that he never made such comments to Dr. Malick.  This evidence, however, is simply too insubstantial to create a genuine dispute of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is not altered by the fact that Ahern denied making the phone calls or by the fact that he was ultimately released from Arbour without a finding that he continued to pose a threat to himself or others.  \"If there is probable cause, it is irrelevant if the suspect turns out to be noncommitable.  The arrest is still legal.\"  Chathas, 884 F.2d at 987;  see Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. at 145, 99 S.Ct. at 2694-95.   Similarly, it is irrelevant whether the defendants acted in an ideal manner.  We conclude that there is no trialworthy issue as to the Fourth Amendment claim;  the seizure, if such there was, was lawful under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dealt extensively with Ahern's various theories of due process violations in connection with his involuntary admission to Arbour.  On appeal, Ahern has not attempted to articulate any due process theory entitling him to relief, but has simply argued that the defendants lacked authority to use the category-three procedure because no emergency existed, and that a warrant should have been obtained under the \"category-four\" procedure, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 12(e).  We therefore treat his other allegations of due process violations, raised in the district court, as waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable seizures more specifically applies to the complained-of conduct than does the Due Process Clause, and thus defines what process is due in the context of the specific conduct alleged to have violated Ahern's constitutional rights.  Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 273, 114 S.Ct. 807, 812-813, 127 L.Ed.2d 114 (1994);  Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, 125 n. 27, 95 S.Ct. 854, 869 n. 27, 43 L.Ed.2d 54 (1975);  McKinney, 726 F.2d at 1187.   We have already explained, in discussing the Fourth Amendment point, that the evidence warranted the police in believing that an \"emergency\" existed by virtue of the real possibility that Ahern might harm Igoe or Cate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern also raises a separate due process claim, arguing that he was deprived due process in the proceedings leading to the termination of his job.  There is no dispute that Ahern enjoyed constitutional protections in his continued employment with the UMB DPS. See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985).  In the district court, he made several arguments to this effect, but the district court correctly rejected his challenges to the adequacy of the notice and opportunity to be heard afforded him prior to his termination.  On appeal Ahern has waived these arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern's only argument on appeal with respect to this due process claim is that the UMB defendants \"destroyed and manipulated evidence in bad faith.\"   In particular, he claims that the UMB defendants concealed or destroyed a tape recording of an interview with Igoe conducted by McBride;  this would have proved relevant and exculpatory, Ahern argues, by showing that Igoe thought that two different people had made the threatening phone calls to him.  Ahern also claims that the defendants used a log of the calls made to Igoe that was prepared by McBride, rather than Igoe's own actual log of calls.  According to Ahern, McBride's version was incomplete and Ahern was thus prejudiced in his ability to show that some of the calls were not made by him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We readily reject Ahern's argument.  There is no evidence that witnesses were unavailable for examination by Ahern prior to his termination hearing;  Ahern could readily have adduced the allegedly-concealed information by questioning Igoe and McBride.  Likewise, he could have discovered UMB's alleged destruction and manipulation of evidence by examining Igoe, who would have had no reason to lie at the pretermination hearing, and who later admitted in deposition that he believed that two different people made the threatening phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, it appears that at most, the destroyed evidence would have shown the existence of a second caller;  Ahern never suggests that with the additional evidence he would have been able to show that he never made the harassing and threatening calls.  We note that Ahern was afforded a three-day hearing before an independent arbitrator, who concluded after reviewing the \"plethora of evidence\" presented by both parties that the evidence \"clearly and convincingly\" established that Ahern made the calls to Cate and Igoe.  In these circumstances, we cannot say that Ahern was denied a fair opportunity to contest his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need only add a brief word on the subject of qualified immunity.  The district court found that the law at the time of Ahern's involuntary admission to Arbour \"did not clearly identify that O'Donnell and McBride's actions might violate the Constitution.\"   See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).  On appeal, Ahern's sole argument on this issue is that the disposition of the qualified immunity question before the resolution of alleged factual disputes is premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  The question whether a defendant is entitled, on a given set of facts, to the protection of qualified immunity is a question of law.  See Elder v. Holloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516, 114 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 344 (1994);  Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922, 927 (1st Cir.1996).  Because the entitlement is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to liability,\" Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 2815, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985), the Supreme Court has repeatedly \"stressed the importance of resolving immunity questions at the earliest possible stage in litigation,\" Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227, 112 S.Ct. 534, 536, 116 L.Ed.2d 589 (1991) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Ahern argues that, on his state-law claims, the district court erred in ruling that the defendants are entitled to statutory immunity under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 22.  This section creates immunity from civil suits for physicians, qualified psychologists, and police officers who act \"pursuant to the provisions\" of chapter 123.  Because we have already determined that the officers acted in conformance with the statute, they were entitled to immunity under this provision on the state-law claims.  Dr. Moran similarly acted within the bounds of the statute, to the extent that she was responsible for the decision to detain and transport Ahern to Arbour.  We find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.

The complaint alleged that the defendants violated Ahern's rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments and asserted pendent state-law claims for, inter alia, false arrest, false imprisonment, and infliction of emotional distress.  The claims were based upon events that resulted in Ahern's involuntary admission to a psychiatric facility and the subsequent termination of his employment as a police officer with the University of Massachusetts at Boston (\"UMB\") Department of Public Safety (\"DPS\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint named as defendants, in both their individual and official capacities, Captain Philip O'Donnell, acting director of the UMB DPS at the time of Ahern's involuntary admission to the Arbour Hospital (\"Arbour\");  David Cella, director of the UMB DPS at the time Ahern's employment was terminated;  Sergeant Patricia McBride of the UMB police force;  Dr. Tonie Moran, consulting psychologist to the UMB DPS;  and Dr. Michael Malick, the physician who evaluated Ahern at Arbour and who effected his involuntary admission to that facility.

Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729694\"><a href=\"/opinion/729694/douglas-t-wightman-v-springfield-terminal-railway-company-and-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span>, 230 (1st Cir.1996).  Most of the predicate facts are not in dispute, although Ahern strenuously disputes the significance of some of the facts.  The salient events are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning of September 19, 1991, shortly after midnight, Deborah Cate's telephone answering machine recorded the following message:  \"Hey.  Guess what?   We took care of that crybaby old fuck of yours.  The niggers splattered his face all over Dorchester.  He's gone.  He's gone.  That fucking crybaby's all gone.\"   Ms. Cate, a UMB student and employee, was not at home at the time of the call and did not hear the message until approximately 6:15 that evening.  Cate recognized the voice as that of Ahern, a former boyfriend, and understood the message to mean that Ahern had caused James Igoe, another of Cate's former boyfriends, to be killed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the September 19th message, Ahern had been a member of the UMB police force for approximately four years.  Cate had dated and become intimate with Ahern during the spring and summer of 1990.  Before, during, and after that same period, Cate also dated James Igoe, who was married and had children.  At the time these relationships were going on concurrently, Ahern knew of Cate's relationship with Igoe.  Ahern also knew where Igoe worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cate dated Ahern through the Fourth of July weekend of 1990, at which time she told him that she wanted to end their relationship.  Ahern was upset by this and for the remainder of the summer of 1990 he attempted to convince Cate to resume the relationship.  According to Cate, he constantly stopped by uninvited to her workplace, interrupting her work, giving her unwanted gifts, and upsetting her.  Ahern repeatedly told Cate that he hated Igoe;  that if it were not for Igoe, Cate would love Ahern;  and that he would \"take care of\" Igoe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern began a campaign of telephone calls to Cate in which he threatened, among other things, to tell Igoe's wife and children of the relationship between Cate and Igoe, and to send Igoe's wife photographs of Cate and Igoe together.  In mid-August 1990, Ahern told Cate that he had obtained Igoe's home address from the UMB police computer and that he was going to go there to tell Igoe's wife and children about Igoe's affair with Cate.  Ahern also stalked Cate and called her to let her know that he had been following her.  On one occasion, Ahern called Cate while Igoe was visiting at her apartment.  When Cate answered the phone, Ahern said, \"He's there, isn't he?\" and told her to look out the window.  When she did, she saw Ahern in a phone booth across the street from her house, looking up at her and displaying what appeared to her to be a gun.  Ahern does not dispute these allegations but states that by the fall of 1990 he had ceased his efforts to convince Cate to return to him and had begun dating another woman.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in the summer of 1990, after she ended her relationship with Ahern, Cate also began to receive obscene and threatening phone calls.  In late September or October 1990, Igoe began to receive harassing and threatening calls at work.  In the calls to Igoe, a male caller referred to an unnamed woman with whom the caller and Igoe both had relationships.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sexually explicit calls to Cate and Igoe continued through March 1991.  Ahern denied making the calls, though he admitted that he had been \"a little crazy\" over his break-up with Cate.  In mid-March, Cate told Ahern that Igoe was still receiving harassing calls and that she believed that he was the caller.  According to Cate, Ahern became nervous and suggested that the caller might be a friend of his who was upset with Cate and Igoe for the way they had treated Ahern.  In April 1991, Cate received another sexually explicit message, the content of which was the same as a message left in January.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early July 1991, against Igoe's wishes, Cate ended their relationship.  In mid-July, Igoe received another call, in the course of which he exclaimed, \"Look, you got what you wanted.  You split Debi and I up.\"   At the end of July, Cate received more threatening, sexually explicit messages.  She was certain that the caller was Ahern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1991, Cate reported the obscene and threatening phone calls to the Boston Police Department, but did not supply any information about the suspected caller.  She also contacted the telephone company, which placed a \"trap\" on her phone for three weeks.  The telephone company then advised Cate that the calls she reported during the three-week period were made from local telephone booths, some from the MBTA station near UMB.  Cate continued to receive hang-up calls after the trap was removed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After listening to the September 19th message, Cate became frightened and concerned for Igoe's safety because she thought that the message could be \"the real thing.\"   She called Igoe at work, at home, and at his wife's home, but was unable to reach him.  Panicked, she called the Boston Police Department.  She told a detective about the message and asked if any serious incidents had been reported that day.  The detective ultimately recommended that Cate call Patricia McBride, a sergeant on the UMB police force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 6:30 p.m., Cate called McBride to report the threatening and harassing phone calls.  McBride offered to interview Cate at her apartment, rather than at the DPS station, because the complaint involved a fellow officer.  At Cate's apartment, Cate suggested that McBride listen to the disturbing message herself.  After listening for a short time, McBride was convinced that the caller was Ahern.  Cate then told McBride that she was certain that Ahern was the caller for three reasons:  she recognized the caller's voice as Ahern's;  the caller related the same information in his calls to Cate and to Igoe;  and the information related by the caller was known only to Cate and Ahern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While at Cate's apartment, McBride listened to other recorded messages and to a tape of calls to Igoe that Igoe had recorded beginning in February 1991.  McBride also collected information from Cate concerning the events of the past eighteen months.  Cate then made two tapes for McBride--one contained obscene and threatening messages that had been left on her answering machine, including the September 19th message and other threats to have Igoe killed;  the second tape was a copy of a tape of phone calls to Igoe, featuring graphic accounts of the caller's sexual interludes with Cate and various threats, including threats to have Igoe killed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cate spoke to Igoe that evening, while McBride was with her, and learned that he was fine.  McBride then called Captain Philip O'Donnell, acting director of the UMB DPS, and told him that she needed him to listen to some tape recordings.  McBride brought the two tapes to O'Donnell's home.  After listening to both tapes, O'Donnell agreed that the caller was Ahern.  McBride and O'Donnell were very familiar with Ahern's voice, both in person and on the telephone, from having worked closely with him on a regular basis.  There is no suggestion that either officer, or any other defendant, bore any animosity toward Ahern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned about Ahern's potential dangerousness and the safety of Cate and Igoe, O'Donnell tried to contact consulting psychologist Dr. Tonie Moran in order to get an expert opinion as to whether or not the caller presented a threat to Cate and Igoe, and to ask her advice.  O'Donnell made no attempt to contact Cate, Igoe, Ahern, the Union, or any municipal police department on the night of September 19th.  He did, however, question McBride about the precautions taken by Cate for the remainder of the evening, and discussed with her the likelihood that Ahern might pose an immediate danger.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, 1991, O'Donnell reported to work at 7:00 a.m., the time Ahern came on duty.  He had asked McBride to report for work early as well and to monitor closely Ahern's whereabouts and activities.  O'Donnell was not concerned that there was any immediate danger to Igoe because he knew that Igoe lived in New Hampshire and worked in Waltham.  O'Donnell thought it highly unlikely that Ahern would drive off campus to find Igoe, because that would certainly have resulted in disciplinary action and possibly the loss of Ahern's job.  As for Cate's safety, O'Donnell had instructed McBride to tell her to stay off campus entirely if she could, and in any case to stay away from the UMB boat dock where Cate worked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Moran called O'Donnell at approximately 7:15 a.m., at which time O'Donnell explained the situation, describing the contents of the tapes in as much detail as possible.  Based upon what O'Donnell told her, Dr. Moran advised him that the caller might be homicidal or suicidal and therefore should be evaluated by a mental health professional, preferably a psychiatrist, in order to determine whether he posed a danger to himself or others.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  She cautioned O'Donnell that Ahern's career as a police officer was not necessarily over as a consequence of the events described;  that with intervention and proper treatment, it was possible that things could return to normal, with no further problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Moran stated that she would not be able to examine Ahern herself that day, but offered to contact another doctor with extensive experience as a psychiatric evaluator.  It took several hours to make final arrangements for an evaluation at Arbour, largely due to difficulties in determining which facilities would be covered by Ahern's medical insurance carrier.  During the same morning, September 20, O'Donnell played portions of the tapes for Lieutenant James Wise, without giving him any information about them, and asked if he could identify the caller.  Wise, who had been Ahern's training officer, and who had worked directly with him on a daily basis for two years, replied that the voice was Ahern's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern reported for work at his usual time of 7:00 a.m.  and was assigned an armed and uniformed post patrolling the UMB campus in a marked police cruiser.  At about 1:00 or 1:30 p.m., O'Donnell called him back to the station and instructed him to change into plain clothes, put his weapon away, and meet O'Donnell in the DPS director's office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Ahern arrived, O'Donnell, McBride, and another female officer were present.  O'Donnell informed him that Cate had made allegations against him regarding obscene and threatening phone calls to her and Igoe;  O'Donnell said that Ahern was sick and needed help, and that O'Donnell wanted him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.  Ahern denied the allegations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Ahern, he asked what would happen if he did not agree to be evaluated and was told that he \"was going one way or the other.\"   Ahern says that at this point he became nervous and frightened;  however, he concedes that he agreed to go.  Ahern allegedly asked to speak to a lawyer or a union representative, but O'Donnell simply grabbed him \"like a buddy\" and \"carted\" him out.  O'Donnell testified in deposition, however, that Ahern was \"extremely cooperative\" and never gave any indication that he did not want to go with the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When they arrived at Arbour, O'Donnell explained the situation to a staff member and, at some point, gave the tapes to a staff member.  The officers stayed at the hospital until about 4:30 p.m., when they were informed that Ahern had refused the option of applying for voluntary admission and was being admitted involuntarily.  Ahern remained in the hospital for 12 days.  Cate received several hang-up calls during the time that Ahern was hospitalized.  She was told by an Arbour staff member who had contacted her that Ahern had access to a pay phone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern was released from Arbour on October 2, 1991.  His discharge summary listed the reason for discharge as expiration of the ten-day period authorized by statute.  After his release, Cate continued to get \"countless numbers\" of harassing phone calls each day.  She continued to receive such calls until she moved in the spring of 1992.  The calls to Igoe also continued, at least through the winter of 1991.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern was placed on paid administrative leave as of September 20, 1991, and was instructed in October 1991 to set up an appointment with Dr. Moran so that she could evaluate his fitness for duty.  They met in November 1991, and Dr. Moran twice consulted with the attending psychiatrist who treated Ahern at Arbour.  Dr. Moran subsequently issued a report in January 1992, in which she expressed her opinion that Ahern could return to full duty on the condition that he engage in a one-year course of psychotherapy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1992, David Cella, director of DPS, informed Ahern that the DPS possessed evidence sufficient to warrant a finding that Ahern had placed threatening phone calls to Cate and Igoe.  Cella stated that, at a minimum, Ahern's actions constituted conduct unbecoming an officer and very likely violated other department regulations.  Cella offered to permit Ahern to return to duty under various conditions, including the inclusion of a letter of reprimand in Ahern's file.  Ahern refused, on the ground that it would constitute an admission that he had made the calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Ahern was provided extensive advice about his rights, a hearing was held in September 1992 as to Ahern's continued fitness for duty.  Ahern apparently did not submit a rebuttal case, and was terminated from his employment with UMB on October 2, 1992, for \"conduct unbecoming an officer.\"   A Union grievance resulted in lengthy hearings before an arbitrator at which the Union and UMB presented extensive evidence.  In January 1994, the arbitrator found that the evidence \"clearly and convincingly\" established that Ahern had made the calls to Cate and Igoe and that there was just cause for termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern subsequently filed the present action.  In its order granting summary judgment to the defendants, the district court first found that Ahern had not been seized so as to implicate the Fourth Amendment because he had agreed to go to Arbour for psychiatric evaluation.  Alternatively, the district court found that the officers had reasonably treated the situation as an emergency creating a likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness, and acted consistently with Massachusetts law, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 12(a), and with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also ruled that in any case, the UMB defendants were entitled to qualified immunity and that, on the state-law claims, Dr. Moran and the UMB officers were protected by Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 22.  This provides for immunity from civil rights suits for, inter alia, qualified psychologists and police officers who act pursuant to the provisions of Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123.  As to Ahern's claims arising from the termination of his employment, the district court held that UMB had satisfied the due process requirements of notice and opportunity to be heard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ahern contends that the district court erred in its rulings on three issues:  (i) Ahern's claim brought under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleging that his involuntary admission to Arbour violated his Fourth Amendment and Due Process Clause rights;  (ii) Ahern's section 1983 claim that the defendants deprived him of his right to due process with respect to his termination;  and (iii) the district court's ruling that the defendants were entitled to qualified and statutory immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is de novo.  See Wightman, 100 F.3d at 230.   Summary judgment is proper if the record materials \"show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  After a thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the arguments presented, we conclude that the district court's rulings were proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with Ahern's section 1983 claims concerning his involuntary admission to Arbour.  A plaintiff asserting a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 must show that the challenged conduct is attributable to a \"person\" who acted \"under color of state law,\" and that it caused the plaintiff to be deprived of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the United States Constitution or by federal law.  See Soto v. Flores, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197155\"><a href=\"/opinion/197155/soto-v-carrasquillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1056</span></a></span>, 1061 (1st Cir.1997).  By the terms of the statute itself, a section 1983 claim must be based upon a federal right.  See Baker v.

Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 12.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Ahern cannot assert a section 1983 cause of action for violation of the state statute, see McKinney v.

Still, the statutory provisions may bear upon analysis of Ahern's Fourth Amendment and due process rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also note at the outset that any section 1983 claim against Dr. Moran is doubtful.  She was a private psychologist who occasionally consulted with the UMB DPS. It is unclear that she was a state actor or acted under color of state law,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and even more doubtful that she can be deemed responsible for the admission.  But given our disposition of the underlying constitutional claims, we need not decide these issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We examine in turn Ahern's Fourth Amendment and due process arguments with respect to his detention and involuntary admission.

Nevertheless, Ahern contends that O'Donnell and McBride took him to Arbour against his will, thereby seizing him for Fourth Amendment purposes.  In support of this claim, Ahern asserts that O'Donnell and McBride told him that he was \"going one way or the other,\" and that he understood that to mean that if he did not go to the hospital voluntarily, he would be taken by force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that Ahern had not been seized, based upon, inter alia, its conclusions that \"Ahern's own evidence demonstrates that despite his protestations of innocence, he gave all external indications of voluntarily agreeing to submit to an evaluation,\" and that Ahern never \"communicated that he had changed his mind.\"   But the question seems relatively close, and we will assume for argument's sake that the facts taken in the light most favorable to Ahern establish that he was seized.  We therefore ask whether the assumed seizure violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness that applies to the defendants' actions, some background explanation is in order.  The Massachusetts statute provides four different categories of procedures for seeking the involuntary hospitalization of an individual for a ten-day period.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 12.  The first two categories permit a \"qualified physician, psychologist, or psychiatric nurse\" to sign a \"pink paper\" authorizing restraint of the person, if the signor believes that the person would create a \"likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness.\"  McCabe, 77 F.3d at 547-48.   The fourth category establishes procedures for obtaining a warrant for the apprehension of persons who are potentially dangerous by reason of mental illness.  See id. at 548.

In that case, a pink paper had been issued pursuant to the category-two procedure of the Massachusetts statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCabe did not directly resolve the question before us here.  Under the category-two procedure, police officers act upon a determination made by a qualified physician, psychologist, or psychiatric nurse, albeit without benefit of an examination, and McCabe emphasized \"the presence of a search authorization by an impartial, or at least a relatively impartial person.\"  77 F.3d at 552.   Under the category-three procedure, however, police officers make the decision whether to \"seize\" the person themselves without necessarily securing expert advice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, we are arguably dealing with a police officer's own decision--rather than that of an impartial expert--we think that Fourth Amendment standards require a showing of probable cause;  that is, circumstances warranting a reasonable belief that the person to be seized does (as outlined in the statute) have a mental health condition threatening serious harm to himself or others.  Other circuits have so held,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and involuntary hospitalization is no less a loss of liberty than an arrest.  We agree with the Tenth Circuit that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>The state has a legitimate interest in protecting the community from the mentally ill and in protecting a mentally ill person from self-harm.  A person suspected of mental illness possesses a right to liberty and a right to freedom from unfounded charges of mental infirmity.  Because a seizure of a person for an emergency mental health evaluation raises concerns that are closely analogous to those implicated by a criminal arrest, and both are equally intrusive, we conclude that the \"probable cause\" standard applies here....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pino, 75 F.3d at 1468.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The proper inquiry is whether probable cause existed at the moment the arrest was made, based on the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer's knowledge and of which he had reasonably trustworthy information.

Ohio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span> (1964).  Here, then, probable cause existed if, at the moment Ahern was \"seized\" for evaluation, the facts and circumstances reasonably believed by the UMB officers indicated that Ahern presented a likely threat of serious harm to himself or others by reason of mental illness.  See Chathas v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528845\"><a href=\"/opinion/528845/alice-chathas-and-byron-ellis-v-norbert-smith-individually-and-as-chief/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 987 (7th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this standard, we find that the undisputed evidence demonstrates that the officers had probable cause to believe that Ahern made the calls to Cate and Igoe, and that, in view of the content of the tapes and Ahern's past behavior, Ahern needed to be evaluated by a mental health professional as soon as possible in order to determine whether he might be dangerous by reason of mental illness.  Moreover, the belief that Ahern might be dangerous was shared by Dr. Moran, a qualified psychologist, and corroborated by Dr. Malick, a licensed physician, who concluded after conducting his own examination that Ahern should be admitted to Arbour.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, Ahern claims that the UMB DPS knew of and was investigating Cate's allegations against him before the September 19th call.  The record contains some support for this claim, in the form of deposition testimony of other UMB officers.  Nevertheless, we agree with the district court's conclusion that \"even if there were some earlier investigation, the complaint by Cate on September 19, 1991, was adequate to trigger an 'emergency' response by the department\" because the September 19th call \"represented a change from threats to do harm, to a representation that harm had been done.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern next says that the defendants' delay in acting upon the September 19th call negates the existence of an emergency warranting a unilateral seizure without more elaborate procedural safeguards.  Cf. McCabe, 77 F.3d at 550 n. 10.  Ahern places great emphasis on the time that elapsed between his return to the station on the afternoon of September 20th and both (i) the recording by Cate's machine of the September 19th message (about 37 hours), and (ii) the time that the UMB officers formed the belief that Ahern was the caller (about 18 hours).  Indeed, during the morning and early afternoon of September 20th, O'Donnell permitted Ahern to patrol the UMB campus armed with a gun in a marked patrol car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is not without force;  in hindsight, some of O'Donnell's actions are equivocal.  Nonetheless, the objective facts known to the defendants clearly demonstrate that a reasonable person would have believed that Ahern posed a \"likelihood of serious harm by reason of mental illness\" and to believe that Ahern's continued presence in the UMB community constituted an \"emergency.\"   The speed with which an emergent problem is resolved is not itself determinative of the existence vel non of an emergency.  We agree with the district court that the undisputed facts show that the delay \"resulted largely from an effort to take appropriate action in a safe and measured manner.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern further suggests that the defendants could not reasonably have viewed him as dangerous because he did not engage in dangerous behavior between the phone call and his seizure, and also because he displayed no visible signs of mental illness while in the defendants' presence.  Probable cause in this context, however, requires only the likelihood of dangerous activity--Ahern's threat, coupled with his history of harassment, threats, and stalking, sufficed to show that failure to hospitalize Ahern would create some danger of serious physical harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the summary judgment materials contain no support for Ahern's allegation that the defendants gave false or misleading information to Dr. Malick that suggested that Ahern might be suicidal.  Dr. Malick's notes contained the remarks, \"apparently suicidal threats today\" and \"told psychiatrist he planned to kill self too.\"   Ahern says that he never made such comments to Dr. Malick.  This evidence, however, is simply too insubstantial to create a genuine dispute of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is not altered by the fact that Ahern denied making the phone calls or by the fact that he was ultimately released from Arbour without a finding that he continued to pose a threat to himself or others.  \"If there is probable cause, it is irrelevant if the suspect turns out to be noncommitable.  The arrest is still legal.\"  Chathas, 884 F.2d at 987;  see Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.S. at 145, 99 S.Ct. at 2694-95.   Similarly, it is irrelevant whether the defendants acted in an ideal manner.  We conclude that there is no trialworthy issue as to the Fourth Amendment claim;  the seizure, if such there was, was lawful under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dealt extensively with Ahern's various theories of due process violations in connection with his involuntary admission to Arbour.  On appeal, Ahern has not attempted to articulate any due process theory entitling him to relief, but has simply argued that the defendants lacked authority to use the category-three procedure because no emergency existed, and that a warrant should have been obtained under the \"category-four\" procedure, Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 12(e).  We therefore treat his other allegations of due process violations, raised in the district court, as waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable seizures more specifically applies to the complained-of conduct than does the Due Process Clause, and thus defines what process is due in the context of the specific conduct alleged to have violated Ahern's constitutional rights.

We have already explained, in discussing the Fourth Amendment point, that the evidence warranted the police in believing that an \"emergency\" existed by virtue of the real possibility that Ahern might harm Igoe or Cate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern also raises a separate due process claim, arguing that he was deprived due process in the proceedings leading to the termination of his job.  There is no dispute that Ahern enjoyed constitutional protections in his continued employment with the UMB DPS. See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></a></span> (1985).  In the district court, he made several arguments to this effect, but the district court correctly rejected his challenges to the adequacy of the notice and opportunity to be heard afforded him prior to his termination.  On appeal Ahern has waived these arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ahern's only argument on appeal with respect to this due process claim is that the UMB defendants \"destroyed and manipulated evidence in bad faith.\"   In particular, he claims that the UMB defendants concealed or destroyed a tape recording of an interview with Igoe conducted by McBride;  this would have proved relevant and exculpatory, Ahern argues, by showing that Igoe thought that two different people had made the threatening phone calls to him.  Ahern also claims that the defendants used a log of the calls made to Igoe that was prepared by McBride, rather than Igoe's own actual log of calls.  According to Ahern, McBride's version was incomplete and Ahern was thus prejudiced in his ability to show that some of the calls were not made by him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We readily reject Ahern's argument.  There is no evidence that witnesses were unavailable for examination by Ahern prior to his termination hearing;  Ahern could readily have adduced the allegedly-concealed information by questioning Igoe and McBride.  Likewise, he could have discovered UMB's alleged destruction and manipulation of evidence by examining Igoe, who would have had no reason to lie at the pretermination hearing, and who later admitted in deposition that he believed that two different people made the threatening phone calls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, it appears that at most, the destroyed evidence would have shown the existence of a second caller;  Ahern never suggests that with the additional evidence he would have been able to show that he never made the harassing and threatening calls.  We note that Ahern was afforded a three-day hearing before an independent arbitrator, who concluded after reviewing the \"plethora of evidence\" presented by both parties that the evidence \"clearly and convincingly\" established that Ahern made the calls to Cate and Igoe.  In these circumstances, we cannot say that Ahern was denied a fair opportunity to contest his termination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need only add a brief word on the subject of qualified immunity.  The district court found that the law at the time of Ahern's involuntary admission to Arbour \"did not clearly identify that O'Donnell and McBride's actions might violate the Constitution.\"   See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 818, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span> (1982).  On appeal, Ahern's sole argument on this issue is that the disposition of the qualified immunity question before the resolution of alleged factual disputes is premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.

Gen. Laws ch. 123, &#167; 22.  This section creates immunity from civil suits for physicians, qualified psychologists, and police officers who act \"pursuant to the provisions\" of chapter 123.  Because we have already determined that the officers acted in conformance with the statute, they were entitled to immunity under this provision on the state-law claims.  Dr. Moran similarly acted within the bounds of the statute, to the extent that she was responsible for the decision to detain and transport Ahern to Arbour.
