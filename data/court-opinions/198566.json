The National Labor Relations Board\r\npetitions to enforce its order against Hillard Development\r\nCorporation, doing business as Provident Nursing Home.  The Board\r\nfound that Provident violated  8(a)(5) and (1) of the National\r\nLabor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.  158(a)(5), (1), by refusing to\r\nbargain with the Union as a representative of a bargaining unit\r\nthat includes thirteen district and charge nurses.   Provident\r\nargues that its refusal to bargain was not an unfair labor practice\r\nbecause the district and charge nurses are supervisors, as that\r\nterm is defined in  2(11) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.  152(11), and the\r\nnurses as such are precluded from participating in collective\r\nbargaining.  See 29 U.S.C.  152(3),(11).\r\nWhether mid-level care providers such as Provident's\r\ndistrict and charge nurses are supervisors under  2(11) is a\r\nsignificant legal issue that has divided the circuits.  It is also\r\nan issue of some societal significance, affecting increasing\r\nnumbers of people who will need nursing home care as the post World\r\nWar II baby boomer generation ages.  The issue is significant in\r\npart because labor costs in the healthcare industry comprise a\r\nlarge portion of overall costs (estimated to be roughly 60% of\r\nhospital costs).  The issue is important both to management,\r\nconcerned with economic viability, and to employees, concerned\r\nabout job security and workplace rights.\r\nHistorically, the NLRB itself has proven unsympathetic to\r\nemployers' arguments that such nurses may not be unionized. \r\nIndeed, the NLRB earlier adopted a unique, more hostile test than\r\nthat used for other professions to determine whether nurses were\r\nsupervisors.  Under the Board's \"patient care\" test, nurses were\r\nnot considered to be exercising authority \"in the interest of the\r\nemployer,\" as required under the definition of supervisor in\r\n2(11), if they directed less-skilled employees only \"in the\r\nexercise of professional judgment incidental to the treatment of\r\npatients.\"  NLRB v. Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. of America, 511\r\nU.S. 571, 574 (1994) (\"Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp.\") (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).  The Supreme Court set aside that test in\r\n1994 as contrary to the Act.  See id. at 574-84. \r\nThis history leads Provident to suggest that less\r\ndeference should be given to the Board's interpretation of  2(11)\r\nthan would normally be required under Chevron USA Inc. v. Natural\r\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984).  Provident\r\nalso argues that the Board's conclusions are not, in any event,\r\nsupported by substantial evidence.  While some of the issues are\r\nclose, we enforce the Board's order.  We find no reason not to\r\napply our usual standard of deference to the Board's\r\ninterpretations of ambiguous portions of the Act, and we determine,\r\nupon reviewing the record, that the Board's findings of fact are\r\nadequately supported. \r\n                       I. Background\r\nWe recount the facts, drawing supportable inferences in\r\na manner consistent with the Board's findings.  Provident operates\r\na for-profit 112-bed residential nursing home in Brighton, \r\nMassachusetts.  It provides intermediate care for geriatric\r\nresidents with major mental illnesses.  The home has two floors. \r\nThe first floor houses  fifty-two residents and is divided into two\r\ndistricts, or units, both of which are served by one nursing\r\nstation.  The second floor has sixty patients, and is divided into\r\ntwo districts, each of which has its own nursing station.  The\r\nnurses provide both nursing care and general assistance with\r\nresidents' daily activities.  The Director of Nursing has overall\r\ncharge of the Nursing Department.  Under her are three registered\r\nnurses who serve as Unit Managers.  The Unit Managers and the\r\nDirector of Nursing are concededly supervisors.\r\nUnder the Unit Managers are approximately thirteen nurses\r\nwho are employed as district nurses and charge nurses.  These\r\nnurses, who are either registered nurses or licensed practical\r\nnurses, directly provide patient care.  The district nurses work\r\nthe day shift and have some responsibility for  reviewing the work\r\nand documentation from the other two shifts.  Charge nurses perform\r\nthe same duties as district nurses, but without any monitoring\r\nresponsibilities outside of their own shift. Charge nurses work on\r\nthe evening and night shifts.  Under these district and charge\r\nnurses are approximately thirty Mental Health Assistants (\"MHAs\").\r\nMHAs are responsible for assisting residents with their daily\r\nactivities, including bathing, dressing, eating, and walking.  Each\r\ndistrict and charge nurse oversees the work of two to three MHAs. \r\nBetween six at night and six in the morning, the charge nurses are\r\nthe highest level of authority at the facility.\r\nUnit Managers organize residents into groups and\r\ndetermine the duties to be performed by MHAs during each shift for\r\neach group.  A district or charge nurse then assigns each MHA to\r\none of these predefined groupings, based on the residents' needs\r\nand particular MHA skills.  Nurses also determine the order in\r\nwhich MHAs take lunches and breaks, within boundaries established\r\nby Provident.  Because the resident group assignments are not often\r\nchanged, the MHAs are generally familiar with their assigned duties\r\nand do not need to be directed closely.  If an MHA is absent and is\r\nnot replaced for the day, a nurse redistributes the absent MHA's\r\nduties to the remaining MHAs on shift.  If an MHA has a complaint\r\nabout an assignment or other work issue, the MHA can bring the\r\ncomplaint to a nurse.  If the MHA and nurse cannot resolve the\r\nproblem, the two will bring it to a Unit Manager.  In emergency\r\nsituations requiring extra MHA assistance, nurses may ask MHAs to\r\nwork after their shifts have ended or temporarily transfer MHAs\r\nbetween floors.  In either event, the nurse will inform the Unit\r\nManager of the nature of the emergency and the solution\r\nimplemented.  \r\nDistrict or charge nurses who observe MHAs abusing\r\nresidents or acting insubordinately document their observations on\r\nan \"Employee Counseling Form\" or an \"Anecdotal Record.\"  MHAs are\r\nalso required to document any instances of MHA misconduct on an\r\nAnecdotal Record.  These forms do not ask for a recommended\r\ndisciplinary measure.  Unit Managers decide whether the reports\r\nwill be labeled verbal or written warnings within Provident's\r\nprogressive disciplinary system.\r\nA district or charge nurse who finds that an MHA is\r\ninappropriately dressed, intoxicated, fighting with other staff\r\nmembers, or sleeping on the job has the authority to send the MHA\r\nhome.  In this situation, the nurse will call a Unit Manager to\r\nsuggest that the MHA be sent home or to notify the Unit Manager\r\nthat he or she plans to do so.  \r\nProvident's MHAs receive annual written evaluations of\r\ntheir work.  Unit Managers assign the nurse who works most\r\nfrequently with each MHA to prepare the MHA's evaluation.  The\r\nnurse comments on different areas of the MHA's performance and\r\ngives the MHA a score between one and five in each area.  Both the\r\nUnit Manager and the Director of Nursing then review the evaluation\r\nform.  They may question the nurse if they feel that a particular\r\nrating is too high or low and may ask the nurse to change it or at\r\nleast review its accuracy before showing the evaluation to the MHA. \r\nAn MHA who disagrees with a rating can also ask the nurse to change\r\nit. \r\nIn 1991, Provident began using the evaluation scores as\r\na basis for an annual merit pay increase for some of the MHAs. \r\nCertain MHAs do not receive merit pay tied to their evaluation\r\nscores:  MHAs who are paid per diem, MHAs already earning maximum\r\nwages under Provident's salary structure, and MHAs who receive\r\nmerit pay based on administrative decisions apart from the\r\nevaluation system.  In early 1993, for example, the administrator\r\nraised the pay range for a substantial number of MHAs and changed\r\nthe evaluation anniversary date for those MHAs.  Accordingly, those\r\nMHAs were evaluated in 1993 but did not receive merit increases\r\nbased on those evaluations.\r\nFor those employees who are eligible for merit increases,\r\nProvident uses a scale that matches a range of evaluation scores\r\nwith a certain level of pay increase.  Provident's administrator\r\nand Director of Nursing change the scale periodically and may\r\neliminate merit increases altogether, depending on the nursing\r\nhome's financial circumstances.  Although the charge and district\r\nnurses are aware that the evaluation scores they give may affect an\r\nMHA's pay, they are generally unaware at the time they write the\r\nevaluation of the precise correlation between any given score and\r\nthe pay increase to which it corresponds.  Once the evaluation is\r\ncomplete, the nurse gives the form to the Director of Nursing, who\r\ncompiles an average score, determines the increase associated with\r\nthat score, writes on the form the increase that she recommends,\r\nand then sends it to the administrator for review.  The\r\nadministrator may approve or disapprove the increase or give the\r\nMHA a higher increase than would otherwise correlate to the MHA's\r\nevaluation score. \r\n                    II. Procedural History\r\nOn October 12, 1993, Local 285 of the Service Employees\r\nInternational Union filed a petition with the Board seeking\r\ncertification as the representative of a unit composed of Provident\r\nemployees, including both the MHAs and the district and charge\r\nnurses.  Provident contended that the Board should exclude the\r\ndistrict and charge nurses from the bargaining unit because the\r\nnurses are supervisors under  2(11) and thus ineligible for union\r\nrepresentation under the Act.  After conducting a hearing, the\r\nBoard's Regional Director issued a decision on November 24, 1993,\r\nin which she directed an election and rejected Provident's\r\ncontention that the nurses are supervisors. \r\nProvident then sought Board review.  While the request\r\nfor review was pending, the Board's regional office conducted an\r\nelection and impounded the ballots cast.  The Board later agreed to\r\nreview the Regional Director's decision \"solely with respect to the\r\nRegional Director's finding that evaluations prepared by the\r\nEmployer's district nurses and charge nurses . . . are not\r\nindicative of supervisory status,\" denying Provident's request for\r\nreview \"[i]n all other respects.\"  Provident filed a request for\r\nreconsideration of the portion of its request denied by the Board. \r\nIn June 1996, the Board granted Provident's request for\r\nreconsideration and remanded the case to the Regional Director for\r\nfurther consideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision in\r\nHealth Care &amp; Retirement Corp. and the Board's decisions in Ten\r\nBroeck Commons, 320 N.L.R.B. 806 (1996), and Providence Hospital,\r\n320 N.L.R.B. 717 (1996). \r\nThe Regional Director's supplemental decision concluded\r\nonce again that the nurses were not supervisors under the Act.  On\r\nreview, the Board affirmed the Regional Director's conclusion that\r\n\"the nurses' role in evaluating employees is insufficient to confer\r\nsupervisory status.\"  Hilliard Dev. Corp., Case 1-RC-20057, at 2\r\n(NLRB Feb. 6, 1997).  Accordingly, the regional office counted the\r\nballots and ascertained that the Union had won the election.  The\r\nRegional Director rejected Provident's objections and the Board\r\ndenied further review. \r\nIn order to obtain judicial review of the bargaining\r\nunit, Provident refused to bargain with the Union, prompting the\r\nUnion to file a charge with the Board under  8(a)(5) and (1) of\r\nthe Act.  Provident's answer to the complaint admitted its refusal\r\nto bargain but disputed the propriety of the Board's certification.\r\nThe Board's Decision and Order reaffirmed its earlier finding that\r\nProvident's district and charge nurses are not supervisors under\r\n2(11) of the Act.  See Hilliard Dev. Corp., 324 N.L.R.B. No. 46\r\n(Aug. 20, 1997).  This application for enforcement of the Order\r\nfollowed.\r\n                   III. Standard of Review\r\nThis court must accept the Board's factual findings as to\r\nwhich employees are supervisors unless those findings are not\r\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.  See 29\r\nU.S.C.  160(e); Telemundo de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. NLRB, 113 F.3d\r\n270, 274 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,\r\n340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951)).  Under the substantial evidence\r\nstandard, \"[t]he Board . . . may not distort the fair import of the\r\nrecord by ignoring whole segments of the uncontroverted evidence.\" \r\nMaine Yankee Atomic Power Co. v. NLRB, 624 F.2d 347, 360 (1st Cir.\r\n1980).  However, \"the possibility of drawing two inconsistent\r\nconclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\r\nagency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\" \r\nAmerican Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 523 (1981)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).  The ultimate question for the\r\ncourt in reviewing the Board's factual findings is \"whether on this\r\nrecord it would have been possible for a reasonable jury to reach\r\nthe Board's conclusion.\"   Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v.\r\nNLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 118 S. Ct. 818, 823 (1998).\r\nStatutory interpretation questions are reviewed de novo. \r\nSee 5 U.S.C.  706.  Where the intent of Congress is clear, that\r\nintent must be given effect.  See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43; NLRB\r\nv. Beverly Enterprises--Massachusetts, Inc., 174 F.3d 13, 22-23\r\n(1st Cir. 1999).  If, on the other hand, the statute is ambiguous\r\nor silent with respect to a specific issue, we will defer to the\r\nBoard's interpretation so long as that interpretation is a\r\n\"permissible\" one, Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843, that is, one which is\r\n\"rational and consistent with the statute,\" Beverly Enterprises--\r\nMassachusetts, 174 F.3d at 22 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nProvident suggests that the Board is not entitled to\r\ndeferential review of its interpretation of ambiguous portions of\r\n2(11) because, it says, the Board is biased and has a\r\nmetaphorical thumb on the scale, tilting the balance toward a\r\nfinding of non-supervisory status.  It points out that a number of\r\nthe circuits have rejected Board orders finding mid-level nurses in\r\nnursing homes not to be supervisors and that several have\r\nattributed to the Board a policy bias in this area.  As evidence\r\nof bias, Provident notes that the Board has found nurses to be\r\nsupervisors only once since the decision in Health Care &amp;\r\nRetirement Corp.  See First Healthcare Corp., 323 N.L.R.B. 1171\r\n(1997). \r\nWe reject Provident's suggestion.  After Health Care &amp;\r\nRetirement Corp., the Board held that it would no longer use a\r\nspecial test to evaluate whether nurses are supervisors under\r\n2(11) but would \"treat . . . nurses the same as all other\r\nemployee classifications and . . . apply to them the same test as\r\n[that] appl[ied] to all other employees.\"  Ten Broeck Commons, 320\r\nN.L.R.B. at 810.  There is no reason, from the facts of this case,\r\nto believe that the Board continues de facto, if not de jure, to\r\napply a special test to nurses.  The Board here has carefully\r\nreviewed the facts, itself evidence that the outcome of this case\r\nwas not pre-ordained by the Board.  Indeed, Provident does not\r\nreally argue this point.  Instead, Provident's argument is\r\nbasically that the Board's interpretations of particular statutory\r\nphrases establish tests in which matters of judgment tend to be\r\nresolved against the employer, when a more impartial and reasoned\r\nexercise of judgment would be in favor of the employer.  If that is\r\nso, then the remedy is in Congress.  So long as Congress has\r\nassigned this interstitial policy-making role to the Board, we\r\nadhere to our usual rules of deference.  Accord NLRB v. GranCare,\r\nInc., 170 F.3d 662, 665-66 (7th Cir. 1999) (en banc); see also\r\nBeverly Enterprises, Virginia, Inc. v. NLRB, 165 F.3d 290, 299-302\r\n(4th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (Philips, J., dissenting) (rejecting the\r\nargument that the Board's purported policy bias gives the court a\r\n\"licence . . . to skew normal standards of judicial review\").\r\n                         IV. Analysis\r\nA. The  2(11) Test\r\nThe NLRA at  2(11) defines as a supervisor:\r\n  [A]ny individual having authority, in the interest of the\r\nemployer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall,\r\npromote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other\r\nemployees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust\r\ntheir grievances, or effectively to recommend such\r\nactions, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise\r\nof such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical\r\nnature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\r\n\n29 U.S.C.  152(11).  This definition is disjunctive:  any one of\r\nthe listed aspects of authority may signify supervisory status, as\r\nlong as the exercise of that authority involves the use of\r\nindependent judgment. See Telemundo de Puerto Rico, 113 F.3d at\r\n273.  The Board has set forth a three-part test to interpret this\r\nstatutory definition:  (1) whether the individual has the authority\r\nto perform any one of the twelve defined duties, (2) whether\r\nexercising that authority requires the use of independent judgment,\r\nand (3) whether the employee exercises the supervisory authority in\r\nthe interest of his or her employer.  See Health Care &amp; Retirement\r\nCorp., 511 U.S. at 574.  \r\nB. The Board's Interpretation of \"Independent Judgment\"\r\nThe Court in Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. rejected the\r\nBoard's \"patient care\" analysis of the phrase \"in the interest of\r\nthe employer,\" noting that \"[w]ith respect to that particular\r\nphrase, we find no ambiguity supporting the Board's position.\"  Id.\r\nat 579.  However, the Court was careful to point out that the case\r\nbefore it did not involve certain other phrases in  2(11) which\r\nthe Court  recognized to be ambiguous.  See id. (finding it \"no\r\ndoubt true\" that \"phrases in  2(11) such as 'independent judgment'\r\nand 'responsibly to direct' are ambiguous, so the Board needs to be\r\ngiven ample room to apply them to different categories of\r\nemployees\").  The ambiguous phrase \"independent judgment,\" which\r\nwas \"irrelevant\" in Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., id., is at\r\nissue here. \r\nThe ambiguity of this phrase stems in part from its\r\nsimilarity to the phrase  \"consistent exercise of discretion and\r\njudgment\" in  2(12) of the Act.  See  29 U.S.C.  152(12).   The\r\nlatter phrase describes the work of professional employees, who are\r\ncovered under the Act.  See 29 U.S.C.  152(3), (12).  The Act's\r\nsimultaneous exclusion of supervisors and inclusion of professional\r\nemployees creates an inherent tension which the Board and the\r\ncourts have tried to resolve since enactment of the Taft-Hartley\r\nAct in 1947.  See D. Rabban, Distinguishing Excluded Managers from\r\nCovered Professionals Under the NLRA, 89 Colum. L. Rev. 1775, 1798\r\n(1989);  see also  D. Barker, Note, NLRB v. Health Care &amp;\r\nRetirement Corp.: Erosion of NLRA Protection for Nurses and Other\r\nProfessionals?, 1996 Wis. L. Rev. 345, 346 (1996).\r\nIn the aftermath of Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., the\r\nBoard found there to be a distinction between the \"independent\r\njudgment\" exercised by statutory supervisors and the judgment\r\nroutinely exercised by professional employees.  The Board found\r\nthat \"making decisions requiring expert judgment is the\r\nquintessence of professionalism; mere communication of those\r\ndecisions and coordination of their implementation do not make a\r\nprofessional a supervisor.\"  Providence Hospital, 320 N.L.R.B. at\r\n719.  Accordingly, the Board held that where the judgment exercised\r\nby nurses in assigning and directing employees is indistinguishable\r\nfrom the judgment that professional nurses routinely exercise,\r\n\"independent judgment\" under  2(11) has not been established.  See\r\nid. at 730.\r\nThe Regional Director applied the Providence Hospital\r\nrule in her supplemental decision, which once again found\r\nProvident's district and charge nurses not to be supervisors.   On\r\nreview, the Board affirmed this conclusion.  In arguing against\r\nenforcement of the Board's order, Provident suggests that the\r\ninterpretation of \"independent judgment\" which the Board adopted in\r\nProvidence Hospital should be rejected as unfounded.\r\nWe disagree.  The Board's interpretation is not\r\nirrational or inconsistent with the statute.  To the contrary, it\r\nharmonizes the Act's definitions of \"supervisor\" and \"professional\r\nemployee\" in a sensible way, consistent with Congress's intent to\r\nexclude as supervisors only those employees with \"genuine\r\nmanagement prerogatives.\"  NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S.\r\n267, 280-81 (1974).  Thus, we do not disregard the Board's\r\ninterpretation of this phrase, as Provident urges.  Instead we\r\ndefer to that interpretation as a \"permissible construction\" of\r\nambiguous language.  Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.\r\nC. The Board's Application of the  2(11) Test\r\nIn addition to challenging the Board's interpretation of\r\n\"independent judgment,\" Provident says the Board disregarded record\r\nevidence in its conclusions and ignored substantial evidence\r\nconcerning the supervisory authority of the district and charge\r\nnurses.   Because Provident makes a manifold attack, we group the\r\nchallenges and discuss each separately.  Under Board precedent, the\r\nburden of proving supervisor status falls on the party making the\r\nassertion of supervisory status.  See Beverly Enterprises--Ohio,\r\n313 N.L.R.B. 491, 496 n.26 (1993).  The question of whether that\r\nallocation of burdens is correct is not before us.\r\n1. Evaluations and Effective Recommendation of Reward\r\nProvident's keystone argument is that the district and\r\ncharge nurses complete annual  performance evaluations for the MHAs\r\nand that these evaluations directly determine the level of merit \r\nwage increases for the MHAs.  This, Provident says, means that\r\nthese nurses effectively recommend the reward for the MHAs, which\r\nbrings them within the statutory meaning of \"supervisor.\"  \r\nThe Board found that \"the evidence fails to establish\r\nthat the evaluations performed by these nurses directly affect the\r\nemployees' job status; therefore, the nurses' role in evaluating\r\nemployees is insufficient to confer supervisory status.\"  Hilliard\r\nDev. Corp., Case 1-RC-20057, at 2 (NLRB Feb. 6, 1997). \r\nWe describe the Board's conclusions and the employer's\r\nrejoinders.  The Board concedes that there is some relationship\r\nbetween the evaluations by the district and charge nurses and the\r\naward of merit pay in some instances, but says that this\r\nrelationship does not suffice to create supervisory status.  \r\nFirst, the Board notes that the instances of influence\r\nover merit pay increases are neither universal nor inevitable. \r\nAbout half of the MHAs are per diem employees who do not receive\r\nmerit pay increases at all.  Even among the MHAs who are not per\r\ndiems, another group does not receive merit increases because they\r\nare at or near the maximum wage or cap.  There was evidence that\r\nthese two groups combined constituted more than half of the MHAs in\r\n1992.  In 1993, nine of the nineteen MHAs who were otherwise\r\neligible for merit increases -- that is, who were neither per diem\r\nemployees nor had reached Provident's wage cap -- were nonetheless\r\nremoved from the merit increase system by an across-the-board\r\nadministrative merit increase, without any input from the district\r\nand charge nurses. \r\nProvident presents the facts differently.  Provident\r\ncontends that in 1992, the majority of aides received raises based\r\non evaluations by the district and charge nurses.  Further,\r\nProvident says, in 1993, ten of twenty-three did; of the thirteen\r\nremaining, four were not eligible because they were per diem\r\nemployees, and nine received the administrative merit increase,\r\nwhich was a one-time, atypical event. \r\n Second, the Board found it was not clear how many of the\r\ndistrict and charge nurses actually completed evaluations of MHAs\r\nor whether they knew what effect the evaluations would have on the\r\naides.  Nurses who testified said that they did not know their\r\nevaluations would affect the merit increases for the MHAs. \r\nProvident says the subsidiary findings to the Board\r\nconclusions are wrong and are not supported by the evidence.  As to\r\nthe point that only a few nurses completed MHA evaluations (and did\r\nonly one or two), Provident says that in 1992 and 1993 all but one\r\nof the nurses completed evaluations; many completed more than one. \r\nFurther, Provident says the Board committed an error of law in\r\nconsidering the frequency with which evaluations were done.  See\r\nMaine Yankee, 624 F.2d at 360 (noting that the question under\r\n2(11) is whether authority exists, not how frequently it is\r\nexercised).  Regarding the Board's statement that it was unclear\r\nwhether nurses knew the effect of rankings, Provident says this was\r\ncontradicted by the nurses' testimony. \r\nThird, and most significantly for our purposes, the Board\r\nfound there was no consistent or direct correlation between the\r\nscores received on the evaluations by the charge and district\r\nnurses and the percentage of the merit increases (where awarded). \r\nThere were several reasons for this.  The increases awarded did not\r\nalways match the evaluation scores given, and the range of merit\r\npay increases awarded varied from time to time even within a year\r\ndue to budgetary factors.  In addition, the determination by the\r\ndistrict and charge nurses of the evaluation score was subject to\r\nreview by others and to independent assessment by the Director of\r\nNursing. \r\nWith respect to the variance in range of increases\r\nreceived, the Board found that employees with the same ratings, but\r\nwho were evaluated at different times of the year, received\r\ndifferent percentage pay increases.  The Board refers to several\r\ninstances in which specific merit increases awarded by the\r\nadministrator had no correlation to the ratings awarded, even under\r\nthe formula in effect at the time:  in 1992, two MHAs who received\r\nthe same evaluation score were awarded different increases, and two\r\nMHAs with different evaluation scores received the same increase,\r\ncontrary to the formula in effect at the time.\r\nAs to the responsibility of other supervisory personnel\r\nin the process, the evaluation form itself had a space for the Unit\r\nManager to fill out.  The job description for both the district\r\nnurse and charge nurse positions state that those nurses write the\r\nevaluations \"[w]ith the . . . Unit Manager.\"  In fact, both the\r\nUnit Manager and the Director of Nursing review the evaluations. \r\nThe Board relied on the testimony of the Director of Nursing, who\r\nsaid that while she had never changed an individual rating herself,\r\nif she disagrees with a rating, she will \"ask the unit manager to\r\nask the nurse to redo it again to make sure that's the score they\r\nwant to put in.\"  There was also evidence that the independent\r\nevaluation made by the Director of Nursing resulted in higher pay\r\nraises for those who emerged with the same scores from the district\r\nand charge nurse evaluations but whom the Director gave a good\r\nevaluation. \r\nAs to the Board's conclusion that there was no consistent\r\nor direct correlation between scores received and percentage of\r\nmerit increases, Provident responds that this is the inevitable\r\nresult of a rolling (year by year) relationship between evaluation\r\npoints and percentage increase.  Regarding the potential for\r\nintervention in the evaluation process by the nurses' superiors,\r\nProvident says that such intervention rarely occurred.  It also\r\nsays this point is irrelevant, because the statute only requires\r\nthe power to recommend reward.  Provident relies on the Sixth\r\nCircuit's decision in Caremore to support this argument.  See\r\nCaremore,  129 F. 3d at 369 (concluding that nurses had authority\r\nto recommend reward because they evaluated aides, even though the\r\nnurses' evaluations were subject to administrative review).\r\nNone of the various circuit cases in the wars of the\r\nnurses, described above, turned on the phrase in  2(11) which is\r\nthe employer's lead argument here - the authority \"effectively to\r\nrecommend\" reward of other employees.  We accept, arguendo, that\r\nthe evaluation process requires the use of independent judgment. \r\nWhether independent judgment is involved in the translation of that\r\nevaluation to a pay increase is a different question.  But before\r\nthat question of independent judgment is reached there is the prior\r\nquestion of whether the nurse's authority in this area is the\r\nauthority \"effectively\" to \"recommend\" a \"reward . . . [to] other\r\nemployees.\"  This combination of statutory phrases is not so\r\nprecise as to rule out Chevron deference. \r\nThe Board, in turn, has appropriately noted that  2(11)\r\ndoes not list \"evaluate\" as a supervisory function.  The employee\r\neffectively recommends reward, the Board says, only when an\r\nemployee's evaluation leads to pay changes, there is a \"direct\r\ncorrelation\" between the evaluations and merit increases or bonuses\r\nto the evaluated employees, and the employee's supervisors do not\r\nindependently investigate or change the ratings.  See First\r\nHealthcare Corp., 323 N.L.R.B. at 1171-72.  The Board has thus\r\ninterpreted \"effectively recommend\" to require a \"direct\r\ncorrelation.\"  This standard is to be given deference because it is\r\nneither irrational nor contrary to the plain language of the Act. \r\nThe question then becomes whether the Board's conclusion that the\r\nstandard has not been met itself meets the substantial evidence\r\nstandard.\r\nTwo themes undergird the Board's conclusion:  that there\r\nis no direct link between the evaluations and merit pay and that\r\nmanagement independently reviews and can change the evaluations. \r\nOur review of the record shows that substantial evidence supports\r\nthe Board's findings on both points.  We focus on those themes and\r\ndo not reach each individual argument made by Provident.\r\nThere is some merit in Provident's reproach that the mere\r\nuse by management of rolling performance evaluations cannot turn a\r\nsupervisor into a non-supervisor.  If the Board's conclusion rested\r\non this point, we might well agree with Provident.  But we\r\nunderstand the Board to have concluded something else - that there\r\nreally is no direct connection between the evaluation of an MHA\r\ngiven by a charge or district nurse and the merit pay increase, if\r\nany, that the MHA receives.  Management retained and exercised the\r\npower over several intervening factors.  The 1993 across-the-board\r\nadministrative merit increase serves as an example.  Provident\r\nrightly says a one-year exception should not create a rule.  We\r\nhave no way of knowing, from this record, whether the 1993\r\nadministrative merit increase was unique.  More importantly, even\r\nin 1992 there was adequate evidence to support the Board's\r\nconclusion that merit pay is not directly linked to the\r\nevaluations.  Two MHAs received different merit increases although\r\nthey received exactly the same scores; two receiving different\r\nevaluation scores received the same increase.  The evaluation\r\nthemselves are independently reviewed by the Unit Managers, the\r\nDirector of Nursing and the home's administrator.  At least once a\r\nnurse was directly told to change a rating; several other times\r\nmere diplomatic suggestions to that effect were made.  Management\r\nin fact reviewed and signed every evaluation and the Director of\r\nNursing entered her own comments on most of the evaluations based\r\non her own observations.  This combination of factors differs from\r\nthat in the case relied on by Provident, the Sixth Circuit decision\r\nin Caremore, Inc., and, in our view, suffices.\r\n  2. Assigning and Effectively Recommending \r\n     Assignment of Work\r\n\nProvident also argues that the district and charge nurses\r\nparticipate in and effectively recommend the assignment of work. \r\nIt makes the following arguments in support of its contention that\r\nthe nurses have authority to assign work to the MHAs.  It says the\r\njob descriptions provide the nurses with authority to \"assign\r\ntasks\" to other staff; that the nurses actually assign MHAs to\r\nparticular residents (through pre-determined groupings of\r\nresidents); that if an MHA is absent, the nurses redistribute the\r\nwork among the present MHAs and can ask an MHA to work beyond a\r\nshift or to float; and that the nurses determine when the MHAs take\r\nbreaks, including lunch breaks.  The employer also focuses on the\r\nfact that the nurses are the highest level of staff physically\r\npresent at the nursing home on weekends and at night.  Provident\r\nrelies on several decisions from other circuits to support these\r\narguments.  See Glenmark Assocs. v. NLRB, 147 F.3d 333, 340-45 (4th\r\nCir. 1998) (finding nurses had statutory authority to assign work);\r\nCaremore, 129 F.3d at 369 (same); Beverly California Corp., 970\r\nF.2d at 1553 (same). \r\nThe Board found that while the district and charge nurses\r\npossess some assignment power, the power is circumscribed and does\r\nnot amount to the exercise of independent judgment.  The Board\r\nplaced great weight on the fact that the Unit Managers select\r\ngroups of residents for assignment to the MHAs; the nurses' only\r\nauthority is to assign MHAs to those predetermined groups.  The\r\nUnit Managers also determine the specific duties to be performed\r\nfor each resident, as well as the shift or floor to which each MHA\r\nis assigned.  Once MHAs are assigned to a group of residents, the\r\nassignments tend to remain the same.  As to the occasional\r\nreassignment when MHAs are absent, the Board found that, although\r\nthe nurses consider the needs of individual residents, the matching\r\nof skills to requirements was essentially routine.  Further, all\r\nfloating work or beyond shift work is based on predetermined\r\nrequirements that there be a certain number of MHAs per unit. \r\nWhile nurses can request that an MHA work overtime, they cannot\r\ncompel the MHA to do so.  Once nurses do exercise their limited\r\nauthority to transfer, they must immediately notify the Unit\r\nManager, who reviews the decision.  Finally, the determination of\r\norder of lunch and other breaks is essentially clerical.\r\nThe Board's conclusion that such hemmed-in, limited\r\nauthority to assign work -- authority which is confined by\r\npredetermined groupings and schedules and is subject to post-action\r\nrecission by a Unit Manager -- is not the independent judgment\r\nrequired by the Act is both rational and supported.  See Northeast\r\nUtils. Serv. Corp. v. NLRB, 35 F.3d 621, 625 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(finding non-supervisory status where employee had no ability to\r\nassign work other than filling openings on a shift from a pre-\r\ndetermined list).  The mere fact that an action is subject to\r\nreview and to being countermanded by a higher-up employee does not\r\nalone mean that the acting employee is not a supervisor.  See NLRB\r\nv. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 405 F.2d 1169, 1177 (2d Cir. 1968)\r\n(\"[The] power to review held by the immediate supervisors of the\r\n[employees] whose status is at issue does not demonstrate that the\r\nlatter are not 'supervisors' under the Section 2(11) definition.\"). \r\nBut the Board does not rely on that fact alone, and its assessment\r\nof what is routine work as opposed to work requiring the exercise\r\nof independent judgment is adequately supported by the record.\r\n  3. Adjusting Grievances\r\nThe Board found that the nurses can resolve minor\r\ngrievances, such as a complaint by an MHA about an assignment.  If\r\nthe complaint is not resolved, it is brought to the Unit Manager.\r\nThe Board found that this level of activity did not\r\namount to supervisory authority because management has not granted\r\nthe nurses authority to bind management, because implementation of\r\na remedy for a grievance can only take place if all of the affected\r\nMHAs agree with it, and because the nurses have no power of\r\nenforcement, and, in particular, no power to reassign an MHA in\r\nresponse to another MHA's complaint without the consent of the Unit\r\nManager. \r\nThe Board's conclusion that this limited role did not\r\ninvolve independent judgment is more than supported.  See Northeast\r\nUtils. Servs. Corp., 35 F.3d at 625 (finding employees not to be\r\nsupervisors where they can moderate disputes but do not have\r\nultimate responsibility for the resolution of disputes); Stop &amp;\r\nShop Cos. v. NLRB, 548 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1977) (same).\r\n4. Disciplining And Effectively Recommending Discipline\r\nThe district and charge nurses do exercise some limited\r\nauthority in the area of disciplining and recommending discipline. \r\nFirst, they document any instances of patient abuse or\r\ninsubordination on forms.  Second, the nurses send MHAs home when\r\nthey observe certain defined infractions such as intoxication,\r\nfighting, sleeping on the job, or inappropriate dress.\r\nIn the first situation, the nurse will document the\r\nincident on one of the forms provided, which contain no designated\r\nspace for the reporter to recommend discipline.  Nonetheless, at\r\ntimes the nurse does include a written recommendation as to\r\ndiscipline or label an incident as a disciplinary infraction.  The\r\nform is given to the Unit Manager and becomes part of the personnel\r\nfile of the MHA.\r\nThe Board found there was no authority to discipline\r\nunder  2(11), only reportorial authority.  Nurses can only report;\r\nothers make the actual discipline decisions.  This supportable\r\nfinding is adequate to sustain the Board's conclusion.\r\nD. The Sum of the Parts and the Whole\r\nTreating Provident's challenge on a clause by clause\r\nbasis under  2(11), we conclude that it has not met its burden,\r\ndespite an able challenge.  Because an atomized analysis may\r\nmislead, we step back to review the entire picture.  Matching the\r\nBoard's conclusions against the purposes for the exclusion of\r\nsupervisors from the Act, we find no mismatch.  Testing the Board's\r\nconclusions against the structure of the workplace, we again find\r\nno mismatch.\r\n\"To achieve a balanced picture, it is important to note\r\nwhat [the employees at issue] do not do.\"   Telemundo de Puerto\r\nRico, 113 F.3d at 272 (emphasis added).  True supervisors are those\r\nvested with \"genuine management prerogatives.\"  Bell Aerospace Co.,\r\n416 U.S. at 280-81; see also 2 P. Hardin, The Developing Labor Law\r\n1610 (3d ed. 1992) (observing that supervisor status derives from\r\n\"[t]he power to act as an agent of the employer in relations with\r\nother employees\").  The charge and district nurses are not vested\r\nwith these prerogatives.  For instance, they do not speak for the\r\norganization, set its policies, assert financial control, or\r\nresolve services disputes - all the sort of activities engaged in\r\nby those given true managerial and supervisory authority. \r\n The claim that the district and charge nurses are\r\nsupervisors rests on their relationship with the aides, who are a\r\nrung below them on the organizational ladder.  These charge and\r\ndistrict nurses are primarily care givers.  The central\r\nresponsibility of these nurses is to care for their patients, and\r\ntheir supervisory authority over the aides is relatively modest.\r\nThat there are employees lower on the organizational ladder whom\r\nhigher level employees evaluate and to whom the higher level\r\nemployees give some direction surely cannot be enough to make the\r\nhigher level employees supervisors.  The NLRB has generally and\r\ncorrectly said that employees who routinely direct other employees\r\nbased solely on a higher skill level are not supervisors.  \r\nThe reasons that supervisors are excluded from coverage\r\nunder the Act are not offended when employees such as the charge\r\nand district nurses are covered.  The exclusion of \"supervisors\"\r\nfrom the Act is thought to be of benefit to both management and\r\nlabor.  It represents the principle \"[t]hat an employer is entitled\r\nto the undivided loyalty of its representatives.\"  NLRB v. Yeshiva\r\nUniv., 444 U.S. 672, 682 (1980).  The exclusion may also help, \"in\r\npart, to protect employees from supervisor influence within the\r\nunion's organization.\"  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 40 F.2d at\r\n1178.  These concerns are not implicated in this situation.  There\r\nis no reason to believe that coverage of the district and charge\r\nnurses would lead to the inherent conflict of interest which\r\nresults when a true supervisor must both represent the employer and\r\nbargain against it.  Further, there is little reason to believe\r\nthat involvement in collective bargaining will transform these\r\nprofessional nurses into categorically different employees,\r\ndisloyal in some sense to their employer and unfit for the original\r\npurpose for which the employer hired them.  Cf. Rabban, 89 Colum.\r\nL. Rev. at 1817 (discussing the possibility that a unionized\r\nuniversity professor would become a \"transformed employee,\" who\r\nwould \"sacrific[e] the professionalism for which he was hired to\r\nthe collective security and adversarial posture of the union\r\nmovement\").\r\nThe structure of the organization also supports the\r\nBoard's determination.  This is a small nursing home, providing\r\nservice at full capacity to 112 patients.  The management of the\r\nhome is primarily handled by four nurses:  the Director of Nursing\r\nand three Unit Managers.  Basic, non-professional services are\r\nprovided by thirty aides.  In between are thirteen district and\r\ncharge nurses.  It would be an odd managerial and supervisory\r\nstructure to have the care of 112 patients entrusted to thirty non-\r\nprofessionals and have seventeen supervisors or managers, all of\r\nwhom are nurses and professionals.  See Children's Habilitation\r\nCtr., Inc. v. NLRB, 887 F.2d 130, 132 (7th Cir. 1989) (using the\r\nratio of supervisory to non-supervisory employees as a \"guiding\r\nlight[] in charge-nurse cases\"); see also Beverly Enterprises--\r\nMinnesota, Inc., 148 F.3d at 1047.  This case is not in the least\r\nlike Maine Yankee, where this court reversed a determination of\r\nnon-supervisory status for six employees who were in overall charge\r\nof a nuclear plant's nerve center, accountable for any plant\r\nfailures and given the responsibility to independently direct the\r\nemployees in the department.  See Maine Yankee, 624 F.2d at 355-65. \r\nWe do not discount the importance of the role played by district\r\nand charge nurses, who care for those in great need.  But important\r\nroles are played by many people who are not supervisors.\r\nFor these reasons, we grant the Board's petition and\r\nenforce the Board's order. \n",

Provident argues that its refusal to bargain was not an unfair labor practice because the district and charge nurses are supervisors, as that term is defined in &#167; 2(11) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(11), and the nurses as such are precluded from participating in collective bargaining.

Indeed, the NLRB earlier adopted a unique, more hostile test than that used for other professions to determine whether nurses were supervisors. Under the Board's \"patient care\" test, nurses were not considered to be exercising authority \"in the interest of the employer,\" as required under the definition of supervisor in &#167; 2(11),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> if they directed less-skilled employees only \"in the exercise of professional judgment incidental to the treatment of patients.\" NLRB v. Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. of America, 511 U.S. 571, 574 (1994) (\"Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp.\") (internal quotation marks omitted). The Supreme Court set aside that test in 1994 as contrary to the Act.

Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Provident also argues that the Board's conclusions are not, in any event, supported by substantial evidence. While some of the issues are close, we enforce the Board's order. We find no reason not to apply our usual standard of deference to the Board's interpretations of ambiguous portions of the Act, and we determine, upon reviewing the record, that the Board's findings of fact are adequately supported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts, drawing supportable inferences in a manner consistent with the Board's findings. Provident operates a for-profit 112-bed residential nursing home in Brighton, Massachusetts. It provides intermediate care for geriatric residents with major mental illnesses. The home has two floors. The first floor houses fifty-two residents and is divided into two districts, or units, both of which are served by one nursing station. The second floor has sixty patients, and is divided into two districts, each of which has its own nursing station. The nurses provide both nursing care and general assistance with residents' daily activities. The Director of Nursing has overall charge of the Nursing Department. Under her are three registered nurses who serve as Unit Managers. The Unit Managers and the Director of Nursing are concededly supervisors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Unit Managers are approximately thirteen nurses who are employed as district nurses and charge nurses. These nurses, who are either registered nurses or licensed practical nurses, directly provide patient care. The district nurses work the day shift and have some responsibility for reviewing the work and documentation from the other two shifts. Charge nurses perform the same duties as district nurses, but without any monitoring responsibilities outside of their own shift. Charge nurses work on the evening and night shifts. Under these district and charge nurses are approximately thirty Mental Health Assistants (\"MHAs\"). MHAs are responsible for assisting residents with their daily activities, including bathing, dressing, eating, and walking. Each district and charge nurse oversees the work of two to three MHAs. Between six at night and six in the morning, the charge nurses are the highest level of authority at the facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unit Managers organize residents into groups and determine the duties to be performed by MHAs during each shift for each group. A district or charge nurse then assigns each MHA to one of these predefined groupings, based on the residents' needs and particular MHA skills. Nurses also determine the order in which MHAs take lunches and breaks, within boundaries established by Provident. Because the resident group assignments are not often changed, the MHAs are generally familiar with their assigned duties and do not need to be directed closely. If an MHA is absent and is not replaced for the day, a nurse redistributes the absent MHA's duties to the remaining MHAs on shift. If an MHA has a complaint about an assignment or other work issue, the MHA can bring the complaint to a nurse. If the MHA and nurse cannot resolve the problem, the two will bring it to a Unit Manager. In emergency situations requiring extra MHA assistance, nurses may ask MHAs to work after their shifts have ended or temporarily transfer MHAs between floors. In either event, the nurse will inform the Unit Manager of the nature of the emergency and the solution implemented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District or charge nurses who observe MHAs abusing residents or acting insubordinately document their observations on an \"Employee Counseling Form\" or an \"Anecdotal Record.\" MHAs are also required to document any instances of MHA misconduct on an Anecdotal Record. These forms do not ask for a recommended disciplinary measure. Unit Managers decide whether the reports will be labeled verbal or written warnings within Provident's progressive disciplinary system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district or charge nurse who finds that an MHA is inappropriately dressed, intoxicated, fighting with other staff members, or sleeping on the job has the authority to send the MHA home. In this situation, the nurse will call a Unit Manager to suggest that the MHA be sent home or to notify the Unit Manager that he or she plans to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident's MHAs receive annual written evaluations of their work. Unit Managers assign the nurse who works most frequently with each MHA to prepare the MHA's evaluation. The nurse comments on different areas of the MHA's performance and gives the MHA a score between one and five in each area. Both the Unit Manager and the Director of Nursing then review the evaluation form. They may question the nurse if they feel that a particular rating is too high or low and may ask the nurse to change it or at least review its accuracy before showing the evaluation to the MHA. An MHA who disagrees with a rating can also ask the nurse to change it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, Provident began using the evaluation scores as a basis for an annual merit pay increase for some of the MHAs.  Certain MHAs do not receive merit pay tied to their evaluation scores: MHAs who are paid per diem, MHAs already earning maximum wages under Provident's salary structure, and MHAs who receive merit pay based on administrative decisions apart from the evaluation system. In early 1993, for example, the administrator raised the pay range for a substantial number of MHAs and changed the evaluation anniversary date for those MHAs. Accordingly, those MHAs were evaluated in 1993 but did not receive merit increases based on those evaluations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For those employees who are eligible for merit increases, Provident uses a scale that matches a range of evaluation scores with a certain level of pay increase. Provident's administrator and Director of Nursing change the scale periodically and may eliminate merit increases altogether, depending on the nursing home's financial circumstances. Although the charge and district nurses are aware that the evaluation scores they give may affect an MHA's pay, they are generally unaware at the time they write the evaluation of the precise correlation between any given score and the pay increase to which it corresponds. Once the evaluation is complete, the nurse gives the form to the Director of Nursing, who compiles an average score, determines the increase associated with that score, writes on the form the increase that she recommends, and then sends it to the administrator for review. The administrator may approve or disapprove the increase or give the MHA a higher increase than would otherwise correlate to the MHA's evaluation score.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 1993, Local 285 of the Service Employees International Union filed a petition with the Board seeking certification as the representative of a unit composed of Provident employees, including both the MHAs and the district and charge nurses. Provident contended that the Board should exclude the district and charge nurses from the bargaining unit because the nurses are supervisors under &#167; 2(11) and thus ineligible for union representation under the Act. After conducting a hearing, the Board's Regional Director issued a decision on November 24, 1993, in which she directed an election and rejected Provident's contention that the nurses are supervisors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident then sought Board review. While the request for review was pending, the Board's regional office conducted an election and impounded the ballots cast. The Board later agreed to review the Regional Director's decision \"solely with respect to the Regional Director's finding that evaluations prepared by the Employer's district nurses and charge nurses . . . are not indicative of supervisory status,\" denying Provident's request for review \"[i]n all other respects.\" Provident filed a request for reconsideration of the portion of its request denied by the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1996, the Board granted Provident's request for reconsideration and remanded the case to the Regional Director for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. and the Board's decisions in Ten Broeck Commons, 320 N.L.R.B. 806 (1996), and Providence Hospital, 320 N.L.R.B. 717 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Regional Director's supplemental decision concluded once again that the nurses were not supervisors under the Act. On review, the Board affirmed the Regional Director's conclusion that \"the nurses' role in evaluating employees is insufficient to confer supervisory status.\" Hilliard Dev. Corp., Case 1-RC-20057, at 2 (NLRB Feb. 6, 1997). Accordingly, the regional office counted the ballots and ascertained that the Union had won the election. The Regional Director rejected Provident's objections and the Board denied further review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to obtain judicial review of the bargaining unit, Provident refused to bargain with the Union, prompting the Union to file a charge with the Board under &#167;&#167; 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act. Provident's answer to the complaint admitted its refusal to bargain but disputed the propriety of the Board's certification. The Board's Decision and Order reaffirmed its earlier finding that Provident's district and charge nurses are not supervisors under &#167; 2(11) of the Act. See Hilliard Dev. Corp., 324 N.L.R.B. No. 46 (Aug. 20, 1997). This application for enforcement of the Order followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court must accept the Board's factual findings as to which employees are supervisors unless those findings are not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 160(e); Telemundo de Puerto Rico, Inc. v. NLRB, 113 F.3d 270, 274 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951)). Under the substantial evidence standard, \"[t]he Board . . . may not distort the fair import of the record by ignoring whole segments of the uncontroverted evidence.\" Maine Yankee Atomic Power Co. v. NLRB, 624 F.2d 347, 360 (1st Cir. 1980). However, \"the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\" American Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 523 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted). The ultimate question for the court in reviewing the Board's factual findings is \"whether on this record it would have been possible for a reasonable jury to reach the Board's conclusion.\" Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v. NLRB, 522 U.S. 359, 118 S. Ct. 818, 823 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statutory interpretation questions are reviewed de novo. See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706. Where the intent of Congress is clear, that intent must be given effect. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43; NLRB v. Beverly Enterprises--Massachusetts, Inc., 174 F.3d 13, 22-23 (1st Cir. 1999). If, on the other hand, the statute is ambiguous or silent with respect to a specific issue, we will defer to the Board's interpretation so long as that interpretation is a \"permissible\" one, Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843, that is, one which is \"rational and consistent with the statute,\" Beverly Enterprises--Massachusetts, 174 F.3d at 22 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident suggests that the Board is not entitled to deferential review of its interpretation of ambiguous portions of &#167; 2(11) because, it says, the Board is biased and has a metaphorical thumb on the scale, tilting the balance toward a finding of non-supervisory status. It points out that a number of the circuits have rejected Board orders finding mid-level nurses in nursing homes not to be supervisors<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and that several have attributed to the Board a policy bias in this area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  As evidence of bias, Provident notes that the Board has found nurses to be supervisors only once since the decision in Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. See First Healthcare Corp., 323 N.L.R.B. 1171 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Provident's suggestion. After Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., the Board held that it would no longer use a special test to evaluate whether nurses are supervisors under &#167; 2(11) but would \"treat . . . nurses the same as all other employee classifications and . . . apply to them the same test as [that] appl[ied] to all other employees.\" Ten Broeck Commons, 320 N.L.R.B. at 810. There is no reason, from the facts of this case, to believe that the Board continues de facto, if not de jure, to apply a special test to nurses. The Board here has carefully reviewed the facts, itself evidence that the outcome of this case was not pre-ordained by the Board. Indeed, Provident does not really argue this point. Instead, Provident's argument is basically that the Board's interpretations of particular statutory phrases establish tests in which matters of judgment tend to be resolved against the employer, when a more impartial and reasoned exercise of judgment would be in favor of the employer. If that is so, then the remedy is in Congress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> So long as Congress has assigned this interstitial policy-making role to the Board, we adhere to our usual rules of deference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Accord NLRB v.

Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The &#167; 2(11) Test</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The NLRA at &#167; 2(11) defines as a supervisor:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny individual having authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward, or discipline other employees, or responsibly to direct them, or to adjust their grievances, or effectively to recommend such actions, if in connection with the foregoing the exercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the use of independent judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(11). This definition is disjunctive: any one of the listed aspects of authority may signify supervisory status, as long as the exercise of that authority involves the use of independent judgment. See Telemundo de Puerto Rico, 113 F.3d at 273. The Board has set forth a three-part test to interpret this statutory definition: (1) whether the individual has the authority to perform any one of the twelve defined duties, (2) whether exercising that authority requires the use of independent judgment, and (3) whether the employee exercises the supervisory authority in the interest of his or her employer. See Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., 511 U.S. at 574.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Board's Interpretation of \"Independent Judgment\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court in Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. rejected the Board's \"patient care\" analysis of the phrase \"in the interest of the employer,\" noting that \"[w]ith respect to that particular phrase, we find no ambiguity supporting the Board's position.\" Id. at 579. However, the Court was careful to point out that the case before it did not involve certain other phrases in &#167; 2(11) which the Court recognized to be ambiguous. See id. (finding it \"no doubt true\" that \"phrases in &#167; 2(11) such as 'independent judgment' and 'responsibly to direct' are ambiguous, so the Board needs to be given ample room to apply them to different categories of employees\"). The ambiguous phrase \"independent judgment,\" which was \"irrelevant\" in Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., id., is at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ambiguity of this phrase stems in part from its similarity to the phrase \"consistent exercise of discretion and judgment\" in &#167; 2(12) of the Act. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(12). The latter phrase describes the work of professional employees, who are covered under the Act. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(3), (12). The Act's simultaneous exclusion of supervisors and inclusion of professional employees creates an inherent tension which the Board and the courts have tried to resolve since enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. See D. Rabban, Distinguishing Excluded Managers from Covered Professionals Under the NLRA, 89 Colum. L. Rev. 1775, 1798 (1989); see also D. Barker, Note, NLRB v. Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp.: Erosion of NLRA Protection for Nurses and Other Professionals?, 1996 Wis. L. Rev. 345, 346 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the aftermath of Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., the Board found there to be a distinction between the \"independent judgment\" exercised by statutory supervisors and the judgment routinely exercised by professional employees. The Board found that \"making decisions requiring expert judgment is the quintessence of professionalism; mere communication of those decisions and coordination of their implementation do not make a professional a supervisor.\" Providence Hospital, 320 N.L.R.B. at 719. Accordingly, the Board held that where the judgment exercised by nurses in assigning and directing employees is indistinguishable from the judgment that professional nurses routinely exercise, \"independent judgment\" under &#167; 2(11) has not been established. See id. at 730.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Regional Director applied the Providence Hospital rule in her supplemental decision, which once again found Provident's district and charge nurses not to be supervisors.  On review, the Board affirmed this conclusion. In arguing against enforcement of the Board's order, Provident suggests that the interpretation of \"independent judgment\" which the Board adopted in Providence Hospital should be rejected as unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. The Board's interpretation is not irrational or inconsistent with the statute. To the contrary, it harmonizes the Act's definitions of \"supervisor\" and \"professional employee\" in a sensible way, consistent with Congress's intent to exclude as supervisors only those employees with \"genuine management prerogatives.\" NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. 267, 280-81 (1974). Thus, we do not disregard the Board's interpretation of this phrase, as Provident urges. Instead we defer to that interpretation as a \"permissible construction\" of ambiguous language. Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

Because Provident makes a manifold attack, we group the challenges and discuss each separately. Under Board precedent, the burden of proving supervisor status falls on the party making the assertion of supervisory status. See Beverly Enterprises--Ohio, 313 N.L.R.B. 491, 496 n.26 (1993). The question of whether that allocation of burdens is correct is not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Evaluations and Effective Recommendation of Reward</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident's keystone argument is that the district and charge nurses complete annual performance evaluations for the MHAs and that these evaluations directly determine the level of merit wage increases for the MHAs. This, Provident says, means that these nurses effectively recommend the reward for the MHAs, which brings them within the statutory meaning of \"supervisor.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that \"the evidence fails to establish that the evaluations performed by these nurses directly affect the employees' job status; therefore, the nurses' role in evaluating employees is insufficient to confer supervisory status.\" Hilliard Dev. Corp., Case 1-RC-20057, at 2 (NLRB Feb. 6, 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe the Board's conclusions and the employer's rejoinders. The Board concedes that there is some relationship between the evaluations by the district and charge nurses and the award of merit pay in some instances, but says that this relationship does not suffice to create supervisory status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Board notes that the instances of influence over merit pay increases are neither universal nor inevitable. About half of the MHAs are per diem employees who do not receive merit pay increases at all. Even among the MHAs who are not per diems, another group does not receive merit increases because they are at or near the maximum wage or cap. There was evidence that these two groups combined constituted more than half of the MHAs in 1992. In 1993, nine of the nineteen MHAs who were otherwise eligible for merit increases -- that is, who were neither per diem employees nor had reached Provident's wage cap -- were nonetheless removed from the merit increase system by an across-the-board administrative merit increase, without any input from the district and charge nurses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident presents the facts differently. Provident contends that in 1992, the majority of aides received raises based on evaluations by the district and charge nurses. Further, Provident says, in 1993, ten of twenty-three did; of the thirteen remaining, four were not eligible because they were per diem employees, and nine received the administrative merit increase, which was a one-time, atypical event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Board found it was not clear how many of the district and charge nurses actually completed evaluations of MHAs or whether they knew what effect the evaluations would have on the aides. Nurses who testified said that they did not know their evaluations would affect the merit increases for the MHAs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident says the subsidiary findings to the Board conclusions are wrong and are not supported by the evidence. As to the point that only a few nurses completed MHA evaluations (and did only one or two), Provident says that in 1992 and 1993 all but one of the nurses completed evaluations; many completed more than one. Further, Provident says the Board committed an error of law in considering the frequency with which evaluations were done. See Maine Yankee, 624 F.2d at 360 (noting that the question under &#167; 2(11) is whether authority exists, not how frequently it is exercised). Regarding the Board's statement that it was unclear whether nurses knew the effect of rankings, Provident says this was contradicted by the nurses' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and most significantly for our purposes, the Board found there was no consistent or direct correlation between the scores received on the evaluations by the charge and district nurses and the percentage of the merit increases (where awarded).  There were several reasons for this. The increases awarded did not always match the evaluation scores given, and the range of merit pay increases awarded varied from time to time even within a year due to budgetary factors. In addition, the determination by the district and charge nurses of the evaluation score was subject to review by others and to independent assessment by the Director of Nursing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the variance in range of increases received, the Board found that employees with the same ratings, but who were evaluated at different times of the year, received different percentage pay increases. The Board refers to several instances in which specific merit increases awarded by the administrator had no correlation to the ratings awarded, even under the formula in effect at the time: in 1992, two MHAs who received the same evaluation score were awarded different increases, and two MHAs with different evaluation scores received the same increase, contrary to the formula in effect at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the responsibility of other supervisory personnel in the process, the evaluation form itself had a space for the Unit Manager to fill out. The job description for both the district nurse and charge nurse positions state that those nurses write the evaluations \"[w]ith the . . . Unit Manager.\" In fact, both the Unit Manager and the Director of Nursing review the evaluations. The Board relied on the testimony of the Director of Nursing, who said that while she had never changed an individual rating herself, if she disagrees with a rating, she will \"ask the unit manager to ask the nurse to redo it again to make sure that's the score they want to put in.\" There was also evidence that the independent evaluation made by the Director of Nursing resulted in higher pay raises for those who emerged with the same scores from the district and charge nurse evaluations but whom the Director gave a good evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the Board's conclusion that there was no consistent or direct correlation between scores received and percentage of merit increases, Provident responds that this is the inevitable result of a rolling (year by year) relationship between evaluation points and percentage increase. Regarding the potential for intervention in the evaluation process by the nurses' superiors, Provident says that such intervention rarely occurred. It also says this point is irrelevant, because the statute only requires the power to recommend reward. Provident relies on the Sixth Circuit's decision in Caremore to support this argument. See Caremore, 129 F. 3d at 369 (concluding that nurses had authority to recommend reward because they evaluated aides, even though the nurses' evaluations were subject to administrative review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the various circuit cases in the wars of the nurses, described above, turned on the phrase in &#167; 2(11) which is the employer's lead argument here - the authority \"effectively to recommend\" reward of other employees. We accept, arguendo, that the evaluation process requires the use of independent judgment. Whether independent judgment is involved in the translation of that evaluation to a pay increase is a different question. But before that question of independent judgment is reached there is the prior question of whether the nurse's authority in this area is the authority \"effectively\" to \"recommend\" a \"reward . . . [to] other employees.\" This combination of statutory phrases is not so precise as to rule out Chevron deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board, in turn, has appropriately noted that &#167; 2(11) does not list \"evaluate\" as a supervisory function. The employee effectively recommends reward, the Board says, only when an employee's evaluation leads to pay changes, there is a \"direct correlation\" between the evaluations and merit increases or bonuses to the evaluated employees, and the employee's supervisors do not independently investigate or change the ratings. See First Healthcare Corp., 323 N.L.R.B. at 1171-72. The Board has thus interpreted \"effectively recommend\" to require a \"direct correlation.\" This standard is to be given deference because it is neither irrational nor contrary to the plain language of the Act. The question then becomes whether the Board's conclusion that the standard has not been met itself meets the substantial evidence standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two themes undergird the Board's conclusion: that there is no direct link between the evaluations and merit pay and that management independently reviews and can change the evaluations. Our review of the record shows that substantial evidence supports the Board's findings on both points. We focus on those themes and do not reach each individual argument made by Provident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some merit in Provident's reproach that the mere use by management of rolling performance evaluations cannot turn a supervisor into a non-supervisor. If the Board's conclusion rested on this point, we might well agree with Provident. But we understand the Board to have concluded something else - that there really is no direct connection between the evaluation of an MHA given by a charge or district nurse and the merit pay increase, if any, that the MHA receives. Management retained and exercised the power over several intervening factors. The 1993 across-the-board administrative merit increase serves as an example. Provident rightly says a one-year exception should not create a rule. We have no way of knowing, from this record, whether the 1993 administrative merit increase was unique. More importantly, even in 1992 there was adequate evidence to support the Board's conclusion that merit pay is not directly linked to the evaluations. Two MHAs received different merit increases although they received exactly the same scores; two receiving different evaluation scores received the same increase. The evaluation themselves are independently reviewed by the Unit Managers, the Director of Nursing and the home's administrator. At least once a nurse was directly told to change a rating; several other times mere diplomatic suggestions to that effect were made. Management in fact reviewed and signed every evaluation and the Director of Nursing entered her own comments on most of the evaluations based on her own observations. This combination of factors differs from that in the case relied on by Provident, the Sixth Circuit decision in Caremore, Inc., and, in our view, suffices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Assigning and Effectively Recommending Assignment of Work</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident also argues that the district and charge nurses participate in and effectively recommend the assignment of work. It makes the following arguments in support of its contention that the nurses have authority to assign work<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> to the MHAs. It says the job descriptions provide the nurses with authority to \"assign tasks\" to other staff; that the nurses actually assign MHAs to particular residents (through pre-determined groupings of residents); that if an MHA is absent, the nurses redistribute the work among the present MHAs and can ask an MHA to work beyond a shift or to float; and that the nurses determine when the MHAs take breaks, including lunch breaks. The employer also focuses on the fact that the nurses are the highest level of staff physically present at the nursing home on weekends and at night. Provident relies on several decisions from other circuits to support these arguments. See Glenmark Assocs. v. NLRB, 147 F.3d 333, 340-45 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding nurses had statutory authority to assign work); Caremore, 129 F.3d at 369 (same); Beverly California Corp., 970 F.2d at 1553 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that while the district and charge nurses possess some assignment power, the power is circumscribed and does not amount to the exercise of independent judgment. The Board placed great weight on the fact that the Unit Managers select groups of residents for assignment to the MHAs; the nurses' only authority is to assign MHAs to those predetermined groups. The Unit Managers also determine the specific duties to be performed for each resident, as well as the shift or floor to which each MHA is assigned. Once MHAs are assigned to a group of residents, the assignments tend to remain the same. As to the occasional reassignment when MHAs are absent, the Board found that, although the nurses consider the needs of individual residents, the matching of skills to requirements was essentially routine. Further, all floating work or beyond shift work is based on predetermined requirements that there be a certain number of MHAs per unit. While nurses can request that an MHA work overtime, they cannot compel the MHA to do so. Once nurses do exercise their limited authority to transfer, they must immediately notify the Unit Manager, who reviews the decision. Finally, the determination of order of lunch and other breaks is essentially clerical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's conclusion that such hemmed-in, limited authority to assign work -- authority which is confined by predetermined groupings and schedules and is subject to post-action recission by a Unit Manager -- is not the independent judgment required by the Act is both rational and supported. See Northeast Utils. Serv. Corp. v. NLRB, 35 F.3d 621, 625 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding non-supervisory status where employee had no ability to assign work other than filling openings on a shift from a pre-determined list). The mere fact that an action is subject to review and to being countermanded by a higher-up employee does not alone mean that the acting employee is not a supervisor. See NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 405 F.2d 1169, 1177 (2d Cir. 1968) (\"[The] power to review held by the immediate supervisors of the [employees] whose status is at issue does not demonstrate that the latter are not 'supervisors' under the Section 2(11) definition.\"). But the Board does not rely on that fact alone, and its assessment of what is routine work as opposed to work requiring the exercise of independent judgment is adequately supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Adjusting Grievances</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that the nurses can resolve minor grievances, such as a complaint by an MHA about an assignment. If the complaint is not resolved, it is brought to the Unit Manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that this level of activity did not amount to supervisory authority because management has not granted the nurses authority to bind management, because implementation of a remedy for a grievance can only take place if all of the affected MHAs agree with it, and because the nurses have no power of enforcement, and, in particular, no power to reassign an MHA in response to another MHA's complaint without the consent of the Unit Manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's conclusion that this limited role did not involve independent judgment is more than supported. See Northeast Utils. Servs. Corp., 35 F.3d at 625 (finding employees not to be supervisors where they can moderate disputes but do not have ultimate responsibility for the resolution of disputes); Stop &amp; Shop Cos. v. NLRB, 548 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. 1977) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Disciplining And Effectively Recommending Discipline</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district and charge nurses do exercise some limited authority in the area of disciplining and recommending discipline. First, they document any instances of patient abuse or insubordination on forms. Second, the nurses send MHAs home when they observe certain defined infractions such as intoxication, fighting, sleeping on the job, or inappropriate dress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first situation, the nurse will document the incident on one of the forms provided, which contain no designated space for the reporter to recommend discipline. Nonetheless, at times the nurse does include a written recommendation as to discipline or label an incident as a disciplinary infraction. The form is given to the Unit Manager and becomes part of the personnel file of the MHA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found there was no authority to discipline under &#167; 2(11), only reportorial authority. Nurses can only report; others make the actual discipline decisions. This supportable finding is adequate to sustain the Board's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Sum of the Parts and the Whole</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treating Provident's challenge on a clause by clause basis under &#167; 2(11), we conclude that it has not met its burden, despite an able challenge. Because an atomized analysis may mislead, we step back to review the entire picture. Matching the Board's conclusions against the purposes for the exclusion of supervisors from the Act, we find no mismatch. Testing the Board's conclusions against the structure of the workplace, we again find no mismatch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To achieve a balanced picture, it is important to note what [the employees at issue] do not do.\" Telemundo de Puerto Rico, 113 F.3d at 272 (emphasis added). True supervisors are those vested with \"genuine management prerogatives.\" Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. at 280-81; see also 2 P. Hardin, The Developing Labor Law 1610 (3d ed. 1992) (observing that supervisor status derives from \"[t]he power to act as an agent of the employer in relations with other employees\"). The charge and district nurses are not vested with these prerogatives. For instance, they do not speak for the organization, set its policies, assert financial control, or resolve services disputes - all the sort of activities engaged in by those given true managerial and supervisory authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim that the district and charge nurses are supervisors rests on their relationship with the aides, who are a rung below them on the organizational ladder. These charge and district nurses are primarily care givers. The central responsibility of these nurses is to care for their patients, and their supervisory authority over the aides is relatively modest. That there are employees lower on the organizational ladder whom higher level employees evaluate and to whom the higher level employees give some direction surely cannot be enough to make the higher level employees supervisors. The NLRB has generally and correctly said that employees who routinely direct other employees based solely on a higher skill level are not supervisors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasons that supervisors are excluded from coverage under the Act are not offended when employees such as the charge and district nurses are covered. The exclusion of \"supervisors\" from the Act is thought to be of benefit to both management and labor. It represents the principle \"[t]hat an employer is entitled to the undivided loyalty of its representatives.\" NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., 444 U.S. 672, 682 (1980). The exclusion may also help, \"in part, to protect employees from supervisor influence within the union's organization.\"  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 40 F.2d at 1178. These concerns are not implicated in this situation. There is no reason to believe that coverage of the district and charge nurses would lead to the inherent conflict of interest which results when a true supervisor must both represent the employer and bargain against it. Further, there is little reason to believe that involvement in collective bargaining will transform these professional nurses into categorically different employees, disloyal in some sense to their employer and unfit for the original purpose for which the employer hired them. Cf. Rabban, 89 Colum. L. Rev. at 1817 (discussing the possibility that a unionized university professor would become a \"transformed employee,\" who would \"sacrific[e] the professionalism for which he was hired to the collective security and adversarial posture of the union movement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The structure of the organization also supports the Board's determination. This is a small nursing home, providing service at full capacity to 112 patients. The management of the home is primarily handled by four nurses: the Director of Nursing and three Unit Managers. Basic, non-professional services are provided by thirty aides. In between are thirteen district and charge nurses. It would be an odd managerial and supervisory structure to have the care of 112 patients entrusted to thirty non-professionals and have seventeen supervisors or managers, all of whom are nurses and professionals. See Children's Habilitation Ctr., Inc. v. NLRB, 887 F.2d 130, 132 (7th Cir. 1989) (using the ratio of supervisory to non-supervisory employees as a \"guiding light[] in charge-nurse cases\"); see also Beverly Enterprises--Minnesota, Inc., 148 F.3d at 1047. This case is not in the least like Maine Yankee, where this court reversed a determination of non-supervisory status for six employees who were in overall charge of a nuclear plant's nerve center, accountable for any plant failures and given the responsibility to independently direct the employees in the department. See Maine Yankee, 624 F.2d at 355-65. We do not discount the importance of the role played by district and charge nurses, who care for those in great need. But important roles are played by many people who are not supervisors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we grant the Board's petition and enforce the Board's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  The caption reflects the erroneous spelling of \"Hillard\" in the underlying Board proceedings.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  The recently enacted Nursing Home Resident Protection Amendments demonstrate concern at the national level for the problems that nursing home residents face.

Indeed, the NLRB earlier adopted a unique, more hostile test than that used for other professions to determine whether nurses were supervisors. Under the Board's \"patient care\" test, nurses were not considered to be exercising authority \"in the interest of the employer,\" as required under the definition of supervisor in &#167; 2(11),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> if they directed less-skilled employees only \"in the exercise of professional judgment incidental to the treatment of patients.\" NLRB v.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the facts, drawing supportable inferences in a manner consistent with the Board's findings. Provident operates a for-profit 112-bed residential nursing home in Brighton, Massachusetts. It provides intermediate care for geriatric residents with major mental illnesses. The home has two floors. The first floor houses fifty-two residents and is divided into two districts, or units, both of which are served by one nursing station. The second floor has sixty patients, and is divided into two districts, each of which has its own nursing station. The nurses provide both nursing care and general assistance with residents' daily activities. The Director of Nursing has overall charge of the Nursing Department. Under her are three registered nurses who serve as Unit Managers. The Unit Managers and the Director of Nursing are concededly supervisors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Unit Managers are approximately thirteen nurses who are employed as district nurses and charge nurses. These nurses, who are either registered nurses or licensed practical nurses, directly provide patient care. The district nurses work the day shift and have some responsibility for reviewing the work and documentation from the other two shifts. Charge nurses perform the same duties as district nurses, but without any monitoring responsibilities outside of their own shift. Charge nurses work on the evening and night shifts. Under these district and charge nurses are approximately thirty Mental Health Assistants (\"MHAs\"). MHAs are responsible for assisting residents with their daily activities, including bathing, dressing, eating, and walking. Each district and charge nurse oversees the work of two to three MHAs. Between six at night and six in the morning, the charge nurses are the highest level of authority at the facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unit Managers organize residents into groups and determine the duties to be performed by MHAs during each shift for each group. A district or charge nurse then assigns each MHA to one of these predefined groupings, based on the residents' needs and particular MHA skills. Nurses also determine the order in which MHAs take lunches and breaks, within boundaries established by Provident. Because the resident group assignments are not often changed, the MHAs are generally familiar with their assigned duties and do not need to be directed closely. If an MHA is absent and is not replaced for the day, a nurse redistributes the absent MHA's duties to the remaining MHAs on shift. If an MHA has a complaint about an assignment or other work issue, the MHA can bring the complaint to a nurse. If the MHA and nurse cannot resolve the problem, the two will bring it to a Unit Manager. In emergency situations requiring extra MHA assistance, nurses may ask MHAs to work after their shifts have ended or temporarily transfer MHAs between floors. In either event, the nurse will inform the Unit Manager of the nature of the emergency and the solution implemented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District or charge nurses who observe MHAs abusing residents or acting insubordinately document their observations on an \"Employee Counseling Form\" or an \"Anecdotal Record.\" MHAs are also required to document any instances of MHA misconduct on an Anecdotal Record. These forms do not ask for a recommended disciplinary measure. Unit Managers decide whether the reports will be labeled verbal or written warnings within Provident's progressive disciplinary system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district or charge nurse who finds that an MHA is inappropriately dressed, intoxicated, fighting with other staff members, or sleeping on the job has the authority to send the MHA home. In this situation, the nurse will call a Unit Manager to suggest that the MHA be sent home or to notify the Unit Manager that he or she plans to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident's MHAs receive annual written evaluations of their work. Unit Managers assign the nurse who works most frequently with each MHA to prepare the MHA's evaluation. The nurse comments on different areas of the MHA's performance and gives the MHA a score between one and five in each area. Both the Unit Manager and the Director of Nursing then review the evaluation form. They may question the nurse if they feel that a particular rating is too high or low and may ask the nurse to change it or at least review its accuracy before showing the evaluation to the MHA. An MHA who disagrees with a rating can also ask the nurse to change it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1991, Provident began using the evaluation scores as a basis for an annual merit pay increase for some of the MHAs.  Certain MHAs do not receive merit pay tied to their evaluation scores: MHAs who are paid per diem, MHAs already earning maximum wages under Provident's salary structure, and MHAs who receive merit pay based on administrative decisions apart from the evaluation system. In early 1993, for example, the administrator raised the pay range for a substantial number of MHAs and changed the evaluation anniversary date for those MHAs. Accordingly, those MHAs were evaluated in 1993 but did not receive merit increases based on those evaluations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For those employees who are eligible for merit increases, Provident uses a scale that matches a range of evaluation scores with a certain level of pay increase. Provident's administrator and Director of Nursing change the scale periodically and may eliminate merit increases altogether, depending on the nursing home's financial circumstances. Although the charge and district nurses are aware that the evaluation scores they give may affect an MHA's pay, they are generally unaware at the time they write the evaluation of the precise correlation between any given score and the pay increase to which it corresponds. Once the evaluation is complete, the nurse gives the form to the Director of Nursing, who compiles an average score, determines the increase associated with that score, writes on the form the increase that she recommends, and then sends it to the administrator for review. The administrator may approve or disapprove the increase or give the MHA a higher increase than would otherwise correlate to the MHA's evaluation score.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 1993, Local 285 of the Service Employees International Union filed a petition with the Board seeking certification as the representative of a unit composed of Provident employees, including both the MHAs and the district and charge nurses. Provident contended that the Board should exclude the district and charge nurses from the bargaining unit because the nurses are supervisors under &#167; 2(11) and thus ineligible for union representation under the Act. After conducting a hearing, the Board's Regional Director issued a decision on November 24, 1993, in which she directed an election and rejected Provident's contention that the nurses are supervisors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident then sought Board review. While the request for review was pending, the Board's regional office conducted an election and impounded the ballots cast. The Board later agreed to review the Regional Director's decision \"solely with respect to the Regional Director's finding that evaluations prepared by the Employer's district nurses and charge nurses . . . are not indicative of supervisory status,\" denying Provident's request for review \"[i]n all other respects.\" Provident filed a request for reconsideration of the portion of its request denied by the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1996, the Board granted Provident's request for reconsideration and remanded the case to the Regional Director for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. and the Board's decisions in Ten Broeck Commons, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></span> (1996), and Providence Hospital, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></span> (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Regional Director's supplemental decision concluded once again that the nurses were not supervisors under the Act. On review, the Board affirmed the Regional Director's conclusion that \"the nurses' role in evaluating employees is insufficient to confer supervisory status.\" Hilliard Dev. Corp., Case 1-RC-20057, at 2 (NLRB Feb. 6, 1997). Accordingly, the regional office counted the ballots and ascertained that the Union had won the election. The Regional Director rejected Provident's objections and the Board denied further review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to obtain judicial review of the bargaining unit, Provident refused to bargain with the Union, prompting the Union to file a charge with the Board under &#167;&#167; 8(a)(5) and (1) of the Act. Provident's answer to the complaint admitted its refusal to bargain but disputed the propriety of the Board's certification. The Board's Decision and Order reaffirmed its earlier finding that Provident's district and charge nurses are not supervisors under &#167; 2(11) of the Act. See Hilliard Dev. Corp., 324 N.L.R.B.

If, on the other hand, the statute is ambiguous or silent with respect to a specific issue, we will defer to the Board's interpretation so long as that interpretation is a \"permissible\" one, Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843, that is, one which is \"rational and consistent with the statute,\" Beverly Enterprises--Massachusetts, 174 F.3d at 22 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident suggests that the Board is not entitled to deferential review of its interpretation of ambiguous portions of &#167; 2(11) because, it says, the Board is biased and has a metaphorical thumb on the scale, tilting the balance toward a finding of non-supervisory status. It points out that a number of the circuits have rejected Board orders finding mid-level nurses in nursing homes not to be supervisors<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and that several have attributed to the Board a policy bias in this area.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  As evidence of bias, Provident notes that the Board has found nurses to be supervisors only once since the decision in Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. See First Healthcare Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">1171</span></span> (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Provident's suggestion. After Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., the Board held that it would no longer use a special test to evaluate whether nurses are supervisors under &#167; 2(11) but would \"treat . . . nurses the same as all other employee classifications and . . . apply to them the same test as [that] appl[ied] to all other employees.\" Ten Broeck Commons, 320 N.L.R.B. at 810. There is no reason, from the facts of this case, to believe that the Board continues de facto, if not de jure, to apply a special test to nurses. The Board here has carefully reviewed the facts, itself evidence that the outcome of this case was not pre-ordained by the Board. Indeed, Provident does not really argue this point. Instead, Provident's argument is basically that the Board's interpretations of particular statutory phrases establish tests in which matters of judgment tend to be resolved against the employer, when a more impartial and reasoned exercise of judgment would be in favor of the employer. If that is so, then the remedy is in Congress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> So long as Congress has assigned this interstitial policy-making role to the Board, we adhere to our usual rules of deference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Accord NLRB v.

This definition is disjunctive: any one of the listed aspects of authority may signify supervisory status, as long as the exercise of that authority involves the use of independent judgment. See Telemundo de Puerto Rico, 113 F.3d at 273. The Board has set forth a three-part test to interpret this statutory definition: (1) whether the individual has the authority to perform any one of the twelve defined duties, (2) whether exercising that authority requires the use of independent judgment, and (3) whether the employee exercises the supervisory authority in the interest of his or her employer. See Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., 511 U.S. at 574.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Board's Interpretation of \"Independent Judgment\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court in Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. rejected the Board's \"patient care\" analysis of the phrase \"in the interest of the employer,\" noting that \"[w]ith respect to that particular phrase, we find no ambiguity supporting the Board's position.\" Id. at 579. However, the Court was careful to point out that the case before it did not involve certain other phrases in &#167; 2(11) which the Court recognized to be ambiguous. See id. (finding it \"no doubt true\" that \"phrases in &#167; 2(11) such as 'independent judgment' and 'responsibly to direct' are ambiguous, so the Board needs to be given ample room to apply them to different categories of employees\"). The ambiguous phrase \"independent judgment,\" which was \"irrelevant\" in Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp., id., is at issue here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ambiguity of this phrase stems in part from its similarity to the phrase \"consistent exercise of discretion and judgment\" in &#167; 2(12) of the Act. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(12). The latter phrase describes the work of professional employees, who are covered under the Act. See 29 U.S.C. &#167; 152(3), (12). The Act's simultaneous exclusion of supervisors and inclusion of professional employees creates an inherent tension which the Board and the courts have tried to resolve since enactment of the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947. See D. Rabban, Distinguishing Excluded Managers from Covered Professionals Under the NLRA, 89 Colum. L. Rev. 1775, 1798 (1989); see also D. Barker, Note, NLRB v.

The Board found that \"making decisions requiring expert judgment is the quintessence of professionalism; mere communication of those decisions and coordination of their implementation do not make a professional a supervisor.\" Providence Hospital, 320 N.L.R.B. at 719. Accordingly, the Board held that where the judgment exercised by nurses in assigning and directing employees is indistinguishable from the judgment that professional nurses routinely exercise, \"independent judgment\" under &#167; 2(11) has not been established. See id. at 730.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Regional Director applied the Providence Hospital rule in her supplemental decision, which once again found Provident's district and charge nurses not to be supervisors.  On review, the Board affirmed this conclusion. In arguing against enforcement of the Board's order, Provident suggests that the interpretation of \"independent judgment\" which the Board adopted in Providence Hospital should be rejected as unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree. The Board's interpretation is not irrational or inconsistent with the statute. To the contrary, it harmonizes the Act's definitions of \"supervisor\" and \"professional employee\" in a sensible way, consistent with Congress's intent to exclude as supervisors only those employees with \"genuine management prerogatives.\" NLRB v. Bell Aerospace Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109011\"><a href=\"/opinion/109011/nlrb-v-bell-aerospace-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 280-81 (1974). Thus, we do not disregard the Board's interpretation of this phrase, as Provident urges. Instead we defer to that interpretation as a \"permissible construction\" of ambiguous language.

Because Provident makes a manifold attack, we group the challenges and discuss each separately. Under Board precedent, the burden of proving supervisor status falls on the party making the assertion of supervisory status. See Beverly Enterprises--Ohio, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></span>, 496 n.26 (1993).

Evaluations and Effective Recommendation of Reward</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident's keystone argument is that the district and charge nurses complete annual performance evaluations for the MHAs and that these evaluations directly determine the level of merit wage increases for the MHAs. This, Provident says, means that these nurses effectively recommend the reward for the MHAs, which brings them within the statutory meaning of \"supervisor.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that \"the evidence fails to establish that the evaluations performed by these nurses directly affect the employees' job status; therefore, the nurses' role in evaluating employees is insufficient to confer supervisory status.\" Hilliard Dev. Corp., Case 1-RC-20057, at 2 (NLRB Feb. 6, 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe the Board's conclusions and the employer's rejoinders. The Board concedes that there is some relationship between the evaluations by the district and charge nurses and the award of merit pay in some instances, but says that this relationship does not suffice to create supervisory status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the Board notes that the instances of influence over merit pay increases are neither universal nor inevitable. About half of the MHAs are per diem employees who do not receive merit pay increases at all. Even among the MHAs who are not per diems, another group does not receive merit increases because they are at or near the maximum wage or cap. There was evidence that these two groups combined constituted more than half of the MHAs in 1992. In 1993, nine of the nineteen MHAs who were otherwise eligible for merit increases -- that is, who were neither per diem employees nor had reached Provident's wage cap -- were nonetheless removed from the merit increase system by an across-the-board administrative merit increase, without any input from the district and charge nurses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident presents the facts differently. Provident contends that in 1992, the majority of aides received raises based on evaluations by the district and charge nurses. Further, Provident says, in 1993, ten of twenty-three did; of the thirteen remaining, four were not eligible because they were per diem employees, and nine received the administrative merit increase, which was a one-time, atypical event.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the Board found it was not clear how many of the district and charge nurses actually completed evaluations of MHAs or whether they knew what effect the evaluations would have on the aides. Nurses who testified said that they did not know their evaluations would affect the merit increases for the MHAs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident says the subsidiary findings to the Board conclusions are wrong and are not supported by the evidence. As to the point that only a few nurses completed MHA evaluations (and did only one or two), Provident says that in 1992 and 1993 all but one of the nurses completed evaluations; many completed more than one. Further, Provident says the Board committed an error of law in considering the frequency with which evaluations were done. See Maine Yankee, 624 F.2d at 360 (noting that the question under &#167; 2(11) is whether authority exists, not how frequently it is exercised). Regarding the Board's statement that it was unclear whether nurses knew the effect of rankings, Provident says this was contradicted by the nurses' testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and most significantly for our purposes, the Board found there was no consistent or direct correlation between the scores received on the evaluations by the charge and district nurses and the percentage of the merit increases (where awarded).  There were several reasons for this. The increases awarded did not always match the evaluation scores given, and the range of merit pay increases awarded varied from time to time even within a year due to budgetary factors. In addition, the determination by the district and charge nurses of the evaluation score was subject to review by others and to independent assessment by the Director of Nursing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the variance in range of increases received, the Board found that employees with the same ratings, but who were evaluated at different times of the year, received different percentage pay increases. The Board refers to several instances in which specific merit increases awarded by the administrator had no correlation to the ratings awarded, even under the formula in effect at the time: in 1992, two MHAs who received the same evaluation score were awarded different increases, and two MHAs with different evaluation scores received the same increase, contrary to the formula in effect at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the responsibility of other supervisory personnel in the process, the evaluation form itself had a space for the Unit Manager to fill out. The job description for both the district nurse and charge nurse positions state that those nurses write the evaluations \"[w]ith the . . . Unit Manager.\" In fact, both the Unit Manager and the Director of Nursing review the evaluations. The Board relied on the testimony of the Director of Nursing, who said that while she had never changed an individual rating herself, if she disagrees with a rating, she will \"ask the unit manager to ask the nurse to redo it again to make sure that's the score they want to put in.\" There was also evidence that the independent evaluation made by the Director of Nursing resulted in higher pay raises for those who emerged with the same scores from the district and charge nurse evaluations but whom the Director gave a good evaluation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the Board's conclusion that there was no consistent or direct correlation between scores received and percentage of merit increases, Provident responds that this is the inevitable result of a rolling (year by year) relationship between evaluation points and percentage increase. Regarding the potential for intervention in the evaluation process by the nurses' superiors, Provident says that such intervention rarely occurred. It also says this point is irrelevant, because the statute only requires the power to recommend reward. Provident relies on the Sixth Circuit's decision in Caremore to support this argument. See Caremore, 129 F. 3d at 369 (concluding that nurses had authority to recommend reward because they evaluated aides, even though the nurses' evaluations were subject to administrative review).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of the various circuit cases in the wars of the nurses, described above, turned on the phrase in &#167; 2(11) which is the employer's lead argument here - the authority \"effectively to recommend\" reward of other employees. We accept, arguendo, that the evaluation process requires the use of independent judgment. Whether independent judgment is involved in the translation of that evaluation to a pay increase is a different question. But before that question of independent judgment is reached there is the prior question of whether the nurse's authority in this area is the authority \"effectively\" to \"recommend\" a \"reward . . . [to] other employees.\" This combination of statutory phrases is not so precise as to rule out Chevron deference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board, in turn, has appropriately noted that &#167; 2(11) does not list \"evaluate\" as a supervisory function. The employee effectively recommends reward, the Board says, only when an employee's evaluation leads to pay changes, there is a \"direct correlation\" between the evaluations and merit increases or bonuses to the evaluated employees, and the employee's supervisors do not independently investigate or change the ratings. See First Healthcare Corp., 323 N.L.R.B. at 1171-72. The Board has thus interpreted \"effectively recommend\" to require a \"direct correlation.\" This standard is to be given deference because it is neither irrational nor contrary to the plain language of the Act. The question then becomes whether the Board's conclusion that the standard has not been met itself meets the substantial evidence standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two themes undergird the Board's conclusion: that there is no direct link between the evaluations and merit pay and that management independently reviews and can change the evaluations. Our review of the record shows that substantial evidence supports the Board's findings on both points. We focus on those themes and do not reach each individual argument made by Provident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is some merit in Provident's reproach that the mere use by management of rolling performance evaluations cannot turn a supervisor into a non-supervisor. If the Board's conclusion rested on this point, we might well agree with Provident. But we understand the Board to have concluded something else - that there really is no direct connection between the evaluation of an MHA given by a charge or district nurse and the merit pay increase, if any, that the MHA receives. Management retained and exercised the power over several intervening factors. The 1993 across-the-board administrative merit increase serves as an example. Provident rightly says a one-year exception should not create a rule. We have no way of knowing, from this record, whether the 1993 administrative merit increase was unique. More importantly, even in 1992 there was adequate evidence to support the Board's conclusion that merit pay is not directly linked to the evaluations. Two MHAs received different merit increases although they received exactly the same scores; two receiving different evaluation scores received the same increase. The evaluation themselves are independently reviewed by the Unit Managers, the Director of Nursing and the home's administrator. At least once a nurse was directly told to change a rating; several other times mere diplomatic suggestions to that effect were made. Management in fact reviewed and signed every evaluation and the Director of Nursing entered her own comments on most of the evaluations based on her own observations. This combination of factors differs from that in the case relied on by Provident, the Sixth Circuit decision in Caremore, Inc., and, in our view, suffices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Assigning and Effectively Recommending Assignment of Work</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Provident also argues that the district and charge nurses participate in and effectively recommend the assignment of work. It makes the following arguments in support of its contention that the nurses have authority to assign work<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> to the MHAs. It says the job descriptions provide the nurses with authority to \"assign tasks\" to other staff; that the nurses actually assign MHAs to particular residents (through pre-determined groupings of residents); that if an MHA is absent, the nurses redistribute the work among the present MHAs and can ask an MHA to work beyond a shift or to float; and that the nurses determine when the MHAs take breaks, including lunch breaks. The employer also focuses on the fact that the nurses are the highest level of staff physically present at the nursing home on weekends and at night. Provident relies on several decisions from other circuits to support these arguments. See Glenmark Assocs. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755406\"><a href=\"/opinion/755406/glenmark-associates-incorporated-dba-cedar-ridge-nursing-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 340-45 (4th Cir. 1998) (finding nurses had statutory authority to assign work); Caremore, 129 F.3d at 369 (same); Beverly California Corp., 970 F.2d at 1553 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that while the district and charge nurses possess some assignment power, the power is circumscribed and does not amount to the exercise of independent judgment. The Board placed great weight on the fact that the Unit Managers select groups of residents for assignment to the MHAs; the nurses' only authority is to assign MHAs to those predetermined groups. The Unit Managers also determine the specific duties to be performed for each resident, as well as the shift or floor to which each MHA is assigned. Once MHAs are assigned to a group of residents, the assignments tend to remain the same. As to the occasional reassignment when MHAs are absent, the Board found that, although the nurses consider the needs of individual residents, the matching of skills to requirements was essentially routine. Further, all floating work or beyond shift work is based on predetermined requirements that there be a certain number of MHAs per unit. While nurses can request that an MHA work overtime, they cannot compel the MHA to do so. Once nurses do exercise their limited authority to transfer, they must immediately notify the Unit Manager, who reviews the decision. Finally, the determination of order of lunch and other breaks is essentially clerical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's conclusion that such hemmed-in, limited authority to assign work -- authority which is confined by predetermined groupings and schedules and is subject to post-action recission by a Unit Manager -- is not the independent judgment required by the Act is both rational and supported. See Northeast Utils. Serv. Corp. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678493\"><a href=\"/opinion/678493/northeast-utilities-service-corporation-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></a></span>, 625 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding non-supervisory status where employee had no ability to assign work other than filling openings on a shift from a pre-determined list). The mere fact that an action is subject to review and to being countermanded by a higher-up employee does not alone mean that the acting employee is not a supervisor. See NLRB v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"283122\"><a href=\"/opinion/283122/national-labor-relations-board-v-metropolitan-life-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1169</span></a></span>, 1177 (2d Cir. 1968) (\"[The] power to review held by the immediate supervisors of the [employees] whose status is at issue does not demonstrate that the latter are not 'supervisors' under the Section 2(11) definition.\"). But the Board does not rely on that fact alone, and its assessment of what is routine work as opposed to work requiring the exercise of independent judgment is adequately supported by the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Adjusting Grievances</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that the nurses can resolve minor grievances, such as a complaint by an MHA about an assignment. If the complaint is not resolved, it is brought to the Unit Manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found that this level of activity did not amount to supervisory authority because management has not granted the nurses authority to bind management, because implementation of a remedy for a grievance can only take place if all of the affected MHAs agree with it, and because the nurses have no power of enforcement, and, in particular, no power to reassign an MHA in response to another MHA's complaint without the consent of the Unit Manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's conclusion that this limited role did not involve independent judgment is more than supported. See Northeast Utils.

Disciplining And Effectively Recommending Discipline</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district and charge nurses do exercise some limited authority in the area of disciplining and recommending discipline. First, they document any instances of patient abuse or insubordination on forms. Second, the nurses send MHAs home when they observe certain defined infractions such as intoxication, fighting, sleeping on the job, or inappropriate dress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first situation, the nurse will document the incident on one of the forms provided, which contain no designated space for the reporter to recommend discipline. Nonetheless, at times the nurse does include a written recommendation as to discipline or label an incident as a disciplinary infraction. The form is given to the Unit Manager and becomes part of the personnel file of the MHA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board found there was no authority to discipline under &#167; 2(11), only reportorial authority. Nurses can only report; others make the actual discipline decisions. This supportable finding is adequate to sustain the Board's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. The Sum of the Parts and the Whole</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Treating Provident's challenge on a clause by clause basis under &#167; 2(11), we conclude that it has not met its burden, despite an able challenge. Because an atomized analysis may mislead, we step back to review the entire picture. Matching the Board's conclusions against the purposes for the exclusion of supervisors from the Act, we find no mismatch. Testing the Board's conclusions against the structure of the workplace, we again find no mismatch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To achieve a balanced picture, it is important to note what [the employees at issue] do not do.\" Telemundo de Puerto Rico, 113 F.3d at 272 (emphasis added). True supervisors are those vested with \"genuine management prerogatives.\" Bell Aerospace Co., 416 U.S. at 280-81; see also 2 P. Hardin, The Developing Labor Law 1610 (3d ed. 1992) (observing that supervisor status derives from \"[t]he power to act as an agent of the employer in relations with other employees\"). The charge and district nurses are not vested with these prerogatives. For instance, they do not speak for the organization, set its policies, assert financial control, or resolve services disputes - all the sort of activities engaged in by those given true managerial and supervisory authority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim that the district and charge nurses are supervisors rests on their relationship with the aides, who are a rung below them on the organizational ladder. These charge and district nurses are primarily care givers. The central responsibility of these nurses is to care for their patients, and their supervisory authority over the aides is relatively modest. That there are employees lower on the organizational ladder whom higher level employees evaluate and to whom the higher level employees give some direction surely cannot be enough to make the higher level employees supervisors. The NLRB has generally and correctly said that employees who routinely direct other employees based solely on a higher skill level are not supervisors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasons that supervisors are excluded from coverage under the Act are not offended when employees such as the charge and district nurses are covered. The exclusion of \"supervisors\" from the Act is thought to be of benefit to both management and labor. It represents the principle \"[t]hat an employer is entitled to the undivided loyalty of its representatives.\" NLRB v. Yeshiva Univ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110190\"><a href=\"/opinion/110190/nlrb-v-yeshiva-univ/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, 682 (1980). The exclusion may also help, \"in part, to protect employees from supervisor influence within the union's organization.\"  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 40 F.2d at 1178. These concerns are not implicated in this situation. There is no reason to believe that coverage of the district and charge nurses would lead to the inherent conflict of interest which results when a true supervisor must both represent the employer and bargain against it. Further, there is little reason to believe that involvement in collective bargaining will transform these professional nurses into categorically different employees, disloyal in some sense to their employer and unfit for the original purpose for which the employer hired them. Cf. Rabban, 89 Colum. L. Rev. at 1817 (discussing the possibility that a unionized university professor would become a \"transformed employee,\" who would \"sacrific[e] the professionalism for which he was hired to the collective security and adversarial posture of the union movement\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The structure of the organization also supports the Board's determination. This is a small nursing home, providing service at full capacity to 112 patients. The management of the home is primarily handled by four nurses: the Director of Nursing and three Unit Managers. Basic, non-professional services are provided by thirty aides. In between are thirteen district and charge nurses. It would be an odd managerial and supervisory structure to have the care of 112 patients entrusted to thirty non-professionals and have seventeen supervisors or managers, all of whom are nurses and professionals. See Children's Habilitation Ctr., Inc. v. NLRB, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530325\"><a href=\"/opinion/530325/childrens-habilitation-center-inc-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">887</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 132 (7th Cir. 1989) (using the ratio of supervisory to non-supervisory employees as a \"guiding light[] in charge-nurse cases\"); see also Beverly Enterprises--Minnesota, Inc., 148 F.3d at 1047. This case is not in the least like Maine Yankee, where this court reversed a determination of non-supervisory status for six employees who were in overall charge of a nuclear plant's nerve center, accountable for any plant failures and given the responsibility to independently direct the employees in the department. See Maine Yankee, 624 F.2d at 355-65. We do not discount the importance of the role played by district and charge nurses, who care for those in great need.
