Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n          Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     James T. Marshall on brief pro se.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Timothy Q.\nFeeley, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         September 10, 2001\n\f             Per Curiam. After pleading guilty in 1993 to being\n\n a   felon   in    possession    of    a    firearm,   see   18    U.S.C.    §\n\n 922(g)(1), petitioner James Marshall was given an enhanced\n\n sentence under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because\n\n he had three previous convictions for a \"violent felony\" or\n\n a \"serious drug offense,\" id. § 924(e)(1). Indeed, it was\n\n uncontested       at    sentencing    that    he   had   more     than    the\n\n requisite three predicates; of petitioner's numerous state\n\n court convictions, the presentence report (PSR) identified\n\n five    that     so    qualified.     Petitioner      later      filed   this\n\n petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, asserting that four of\n\n those five convictions no longer were, or never had been,\n\n valid ACCA predicates.1 In response, the government accepted\n\n that allegation as true.             It nonetheless argued that the\n\n enhanced sentence could be upheld by relying on two other\n\n previous convictions that had been listed in the PSR but not\n\n there designated as ACCA predicates.               These would provide\n\n the required three predicates, it asserted, when combined\n\n with the earlier one that remained unchallenged.                         Over\n\n petitioner's objections, the district court agreed with this\n\n\n     1 He alleged that one predicate had since been invalidated\nin state court, two others no longer qualified because of\nintervening case law, and the fourth had never qualified.\n\n                                      -2-\n\freasoning and thus denied the petition.           It later granted a\n\ncertificate of appealability.         We affirm substantially for\n\nthe reasons recounted in the district court's comprehensive\n\nopinion, adding only the following comments.\n\n            The two substitute predicates consist of a 1974\n\nconviction for larceny from the person (No. 81260) and a\n\n1974 conviction for attempted larceny from the person (No.\n\n81261), both of which were listed in ¶ 47 of the PSR.            The\n\nprincipal     dispute   below   was     whether     these   offenses\n\nconstituted felony convictions under Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n266, § 25(b) or misdemeanor convictions under ch. 266, §\n\n30(1).      The former provision concerns larceny from the\n\nperson; the latter involves generic larceny.           Based on its\n\nreview of certain state court records, the district court\n\ndetermined that the ¶ 47 offenses were felonies prosecuted\n\nunder § 25(b).      We agree.      Even without taking judicial\n\nnotice   of   the   supplemental      records   submitted   by   the\n\ngovernment for the first time on appeal, see United States\n\nv. Bregnard, 951 F.2d 457, 460 n.2 (1st Cir. 1991), we find\n\nthe court's conclusion amply supported.         For example, in No.\n\n81260, the juvenile court docket sheet specifically cited to\n\n§ 25; the superior court indictment charged that petitioner\n\n\"did steal from the person\"; and the docket sheet described\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f the offense as \"[l]arceny from the person.\"                      Similarly, in\n\n No.    81261,    the    indictment        alleged    that    petitioner      \"did\n\n attempt to steal from the person\"; and the docket sheet\n\n listed the offense as \"[a]ttempt to commit larceny from\n\n person.\"\n\n             On    appeal,       petitioner       concedes    that    the    ¶    47\n\n offenses    were       for   larceny      from   the    person    (actual       and\n\n attempted), but goes on to contend that he could have been\n\n convicted therefor under § 30(1).                To the contrary, the case\n\n law and relevant authorities all tie that offense to §\n\n 25(b).2    See, e.g., United States v. De Jesus, 984 F.2d 21,\n\n 23 (1st Cir. 1993); Commonwealth v. Moorer, 431 Mass. 544,\n\n 545 (2000); J. Nolan & B. Henry, 32 Mass. Practice: Criminal\n\n Law § 291 (1988 & '00 Supp.).                    We find     Commonwealth v.\n\n Lashway,    36     Mass.      App.       Ct.   677   (1994),     particularly\n\n instructive.           There,      a   defendant     convicted      of    unarmed\n\n robbery    complained         of       being   denied    a   lesser-included\n\n instruction for larceny under § 30(1).                  The court affirmed,\n\n finding the evidence clear that whatever taking had occurred\n\n \"was indubitably from the person.\"                   Id. at 683.         It added\n\n\n    2  Like the district court, we think the citation to § 30 in\nthe district attorney's recent state court briefing (addressing\npetitioner's motion to withdraw his plea) was a simple\ntypographical error, especially since the offense was there\nspecifically described as larceny from the person.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f that,   for   this     reason,   the    lesser-included       offense   of\n\n larceny   from   the    person   under    §   25(b)   might    have   been\n\n charged, but no such request had been made.             See id.   In any\n\n event, in the instant case there is not the slightest hint\n\n that petitioner's ¶ 47 convictions involved § 30(1).3\n\n            Petitioner next contends that the ¶ 47 offenses do\n\n not qualify as ACCA predicates because, even though he was\n\n tried as an adult, he was a juvenile when he committed them.\n\n This argument was never squarely presented below and has\n\n been advanced only in perfunctory fashion on appeal--and so\n\n has arguably been waived.              See, e.g., United States v.\n\n Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).              Petitioner in any\n\n event has offered nothing to call into question the solid\n\n line of authority holding to the contrary.                    See, e.g.,\n\n United States v. Cure, 996 F.2d 1136, 1139-41 (11th Cir.\n\n 1993); United States v. Lender, 985 F.2d 151, 155-57 (4th\n\n Cir. 1993).\n\n\n\n    3  We likewise agree with the district court that No. 81261\nwas subject to the \"second,\" rather than the \"fourth,\" paragraph\nof Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 274, § 6--the statutory provision\nprescribing punishment for attempted crimes. We might add that\npetitioner would not benefit even if it were otherwise. Since\nthe \"fourth\" paragraph carries a maximum term greater than two\nyears, a violation thereof, even though a misdemeanor under\nstate law, would still qualify as a \"violent felony\" under the\nACCA.   See, e.g., Bregnard, 951 F.2d at 460-61 (applying 18\nU.S.C. § 921(a)(20)).\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          Again without developed argumentation, petitioner\n\nalso asserts that to now rely on convictions that were\n\nlisted in the PSR but not there identified as predicates\n\nwould violate due process.        We have explained that pretrial\n\nnotice   of   the     possibility    of    enhanced    sentencing       for\n\nrecidivism is not necessary, but that due process does\n\nrequire \"reasonable notice of and an opportunity to be heard\n\nconcerning      the   prior    convictions.\"         United    States    v.\n\nCraveiro, 907 F.2d 260, 264 (1st Cir. 1990); accord, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. O'Neal, 180 F.3d 115, 125-26 (4th Cir.) (\"a\n\ndefendant does have a right to adequate notice of ... the\n\nconvictions that may support [an ACCA] enhancement\"), cert.\n\ndenied, 528 U.S. 980 (1999); United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d\n\n187,   198-99    (1st   Cir.    1994)     (holding    that    listing    of\n\npredicates in PSR is sufficient).           Whether these protections\n\ncontinue to apply after termination of the direct appeal,\n\nwhere a predicate has been invalidated and the government\n\nattempts to substitute another therefor, is a matter we need\n\nnot decide, for petitioner has received all process that\n\nmight be due.     The government's habeas opposition, proposing\n\nreliance on the ¶ 47 convictions, provided sufficient notice\n\nto allow him \"to contest the validity or applicability of\n\nthe prior convictions.\"         United States v. Moore, 208 F.3d\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f411, 414 (2d Cir.) (per curiam), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 905\n\n(2000).    The main prejudice of which petitioner complains--\n\nthat    intervening       case   law     has   allegedly        made    it    more\n\ndifficult to collaterally attack his ¶ 47 convictions in\n\nstate    court--is    beyond       the    scope    of     the    due    process\n\nsafeguard in this context.\n\n            We     have     considered          petitioner's           remaining\n\ncontentions and find them without merit.                   We will briefly\n\nmention four.      First, he suggests that, because the two ¶ 47\n\nconvictions were consolidated in state court for pleading\n\nand sentencing purposes, they constituted a single offense.\n\nTo the contrary, \"crimes which were committed on different\n\ndates ... and targeted different victims are to be treated\n\nas distinct\" under § 924(e).             United States v. Sullivan, 98\n\nF.3d 686, 688 (1st Cir. 1996).               Second, he alleges that he\n\nshould have been permitted, in the § 2255 proceeding, to\n\nchallenge his ¶ 47 convictions.              This argument is foreclosed\n\nby Daniels v. United States, 121 S. Ct. 1578 (2001).                      Third,\n\nhe     complains    that     his    attorney      rendered        ineffective\n\nassistance at sentencing in failing to challenge the listed\n\npredicates.        This    claim   fails       inasmuch    as    three       valid\n\npredicates existed at that time and continue to exist today.\n\nFinally, petitioner asks for \"any relief he may have\" under\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000).   He has none at\n\nthis time.   Various courts, noting that Apprendi expressly\n\ndeclined to overrule Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523\n\nU.S. 224 (1998), have rejected Apprendi-based challenges to\n\nan ACCA enhancement.   See, e.g., United States v. Skidmore,\n\n254 F.3d 635, 641-42 (7th Cir. 2001).\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -8-\n\f",

Petitioner in any\n\n event has offered nothing to call into question the solid\n\n line of authority holding to the contrary.                    See, e.g.,\n\n United States v. Cure, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609831\"><a href=\"/opinion/609831/united-states-v-william-cure-aka-calvin-coach/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1139-41 (11th Cir.\n\n 1993); United States v.

Gen. Laws ch. 274, § 6--the statutory provision\nprescribing punishment for attempted crimes. We might add that\npetitioner would not benefit even if it were otherwise. Since\nthe \"fourth\" paragraph carries a maximum term greater than two\nyears, a violation thereof, even though a misdemeanor under\nstate law, would still qualify as a \"violent felony\" under the\nACCA.   See, e.g., Bregnard, 951 F.2d at 460-61 (applying 18\nU.S.C. § 921(a)(20)).\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          Again without developed argumentation, petitioner\n\nalso asserts that to now rely on convictions that were\n\nlisted in the PSR but not there identified as predicates\n\nwould violate due process.        We have explained that pretrial\n\nnotice   of   the     possibility    of    enhanced    sentencing       for\n\nrecidivism is not necessary, but that due process does\n\nrequire \"reasonable notice of and an opportunity to be heard\n\nconcerning      the   prior    convictions.\"         United    States    v.\n\nCraveiro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544231\"><a href=\"/opinion/544231/united-states-v-joseph-m-craveiro/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264 (1st Cir. 1990); accord, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v.

Whether these protections\n\ncontinue to apply after termination of the direct appeal,\n\nwhere a predicate has been invalidated and the government\n\nattempts to substitute another therefor, is a matter we need\n\nnot decide, for petitioner has received all process that\n\nmight be due.     The government's habeas opposition, proposing\n\nreliance on the ¶ 47 convictions, provided sufficient notice\n\nto allow him \"to contest the validity or applicability of\n\nthe prior convictions.\"         United States v. Moore, 208 F.3d\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f411, 414 (2d Cir.)

The main prejudice of which petitioner complains--\n\nthat    intervening       case   law     has   allegedly        made    it    more\n\ndifficult to collaterally attack his ¶ 47 convictions in\n\nstate    court--is    beyond       the    scope    of     the    due    process\n\nsafeguard in this context.\n\n            We     have     considered          petitioner's           remaining\n\ncontentions and find them without merit.                   We will briefly\n\nmention four.      First, he suggests that, because the two ¶ 47\n\nconvictions were consolidated in state court for pleading\n\nand sentencing purposes, they constituted a single offense.\n\nTo the contrary, \"crimes which were committed on different\n\ndates ... and targeted different victims are to be treated\n\nas distinct\" under § 924(e).             United States v. Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197048\"><a href=\"/opinion/197048/united-states-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 688 (1st Cir. 1996).               Second, he alleges that he\n\nshould have been permitted, in the § 2255 proceeding, to\n\nchallenge his ¶ 47 convictions.              This argument is foreclosed\n\nby Daniels v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620704\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620704/daniels-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Third,\n\nhe     complains    that     his    attorney      rendered        ineffective\n\nassistance at sentencing in failing to challenge the listed\n\npredicates.        This    claim   fails       inasmuch    as    three       valid\n\npredicates existed at that time and continue to exist today.\n\nFinally, petitioner asks for \"any relief he may have\" under\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fApprendi v.
