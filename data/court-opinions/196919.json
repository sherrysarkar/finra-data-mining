The\r\n\nconspirators  agreed to search  out a vehicle  bearing government\r\n\nlicense plates  to  facilitate the  planned entry  upon the  jail\r\n\npremises.   During their meeting,  Nu ez saw an  associate accept\r\n\ndelivery of  a handgun.   Later the  same evening,  after driving\r\n\naround San  Juan  for several  hours,  Nu ez and  two  associates\r\n\nspotted Jos   Jaime Pierluisi-Urrutia  (\"Pierluisi\"), brother  of\r\n\nthe Secretary of  Justice of the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico, as\r\n\nhe returned home around midnight in a car with government plates.\r\n\n          After parking their own car, Nu ez and an associate ap-\r\n\nproached the  unsuspecting Pierluisi  as he  began unloading  the\r\n\ntrunk.  The  associate brandished a handgun and  demanded the car\r\n\nkeys.   After relinquishing  the keys without  protest, Pierluisi\r\n\nwas summarily  murdered by the associate with  a shot to the back\r\n\nof  his head  as Nu ez  prepared to  drive away in  the Pierluisi\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nvehicle.  Following the murder, Nu ez drove the Pierluisi vehicle\r\n\nto the housing development where he lived. \r\n\n          The  next day,  after learning  that the  FBI  had been\r\n\ninquiring  as to  his whereabouts,  Nu ez  presented himself  for\r\n\nquestioning.  Although he readily admitted his involvement in the\r\n\ncarjacking,  he steadfastly maintained that he had been abducted,\r\n\nthreatened  with a  gun, and  forced  to participate.   During  a\r\n\nsubsequent consensual search of the apartment where he lived, FBI\r\n\nagents seized a  briefcase and passport, as well  as clothing and\r\n\ncredit cards, belonging to the victim.  \r\n\n          After  Nu ez was indicted, he offered to cooperate with\r\n\nthe  government provided he received total immunity from prosecu-\r\n\ntion.  More than seven months after his confession, and less than\r\n\na week prior to the scheduled trial, Nu ez finally pled guilty to\r\n\nthe  charges without  the benefit  of a  plea agreement.   Subse-\r\n\nquently he  filed a pro se motion to  set aside his guilty pleas,\r                                    \r\n\nwhich he withdrew following the  appointment of new counsel.  The\r\n\ndistrict court ultimately  sentenced Nu ez  to life  imprisonment\r\n\nplus  sixty  months,  after  refusing  downward  adjustments  for\r\n\nacceptance  of  responsibility  and  \"minor  participation,\"  and\r\n\nrejecting a downward  departure request based on  \"reduced mental\r\n\ncapacity.\" \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nA.   \"Acceptance of Responsibility\" (U.S.S.G.   3E1.1)1\r          A.   \"Acceptance of Responsibility\" (U.S.S.G.   3E1.1)1\r                                                               \r\n\n          Nu ez first contends that  the district court committed\r\n\nreversible  error in  refusing  to  adopt  a  presentence  report\r\n\n(\"PSR\") recommendation that  he receive  a three-point  reduction\r\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.2 \r\n\n          Nu ez maintains that he  met his burden of  proof under\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Nunez  was sentenced  under the  November  1994 guidelines,\r\nwherein   3E1.1 provided:\r\n\n          (a) If  the defendant clearly  demonstrates accep-\r\n     tance of  responsibility for his offense,  decrease the\r\n     offense level by 2 levels.\r\n\n          (b)  If  the  defendant qualifies  for  a decrease\r\n     under  subsection  (a),  the  offense level  determined\r\n     prior to the operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or\r\n     greater, and the defendant has assisted authorities  in\r\n     the investigation or prosecution  of his own misconduct\r\n     by taking one or more of the following steps:\r\n\n               (1) timely providing  complete information to\r\n          the government  concerning his own  involvement in\r\n          the offense; or\r\n\n               (2) timely  notifying authorities of  his in-\r\n          tention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permit-\r\n          ting the government  to avoid preparing for  trial\r\n          and permitting the court to allocate its resources\r\n          efficiently,\r\n\n     decrease the offense level by 1 additional level.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1 (Nov. 1994).\r\n\n     2The claimed entitlement to  a three-point downward  adjust-\r                                                   \r\nment for acceptance  of responsibility under U.S.S.G.    3E1.1(b)\r\nis  frivolous, since  the undisputed  evidence unmistakably  dis-\r\nclosed  that  Nu ez  provided  neither  \"timely\"  nor  \"complete\"\r\ninformation to the  government concerning his own  involvement in\r\nthe  offense.

Nu ez\r\n\nfurther  contends that  the district  court erred  by  relying on\r\n\nother factors it deemed \"inconsistent\" with acceptance of respon-\r\n\nsibility,  including  Nu ez' continuing  and  willful failure  to\r\n\ndisclose the  names of  some of his  accomplices.3   This factor,\r\n\nNu ez maintains, can  be relevant only to a  defendant's entitle-\r                                                \r\n\nment to a   5K1.1  downward departure for \"substantial assistance\r\n\nto [law enforcement] authorities.\" See U.S.S.G.   5K1.1.4\r                                                \r\n\n     1.

First,\r\n\nNu ez delayed  his guilty  plea for six  months, until  five days\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Nunez did provide the first names of two accomplices.\r\n\n     4Because a two-point  offense-level reduction under    3E1.-\r\n1(b) would have lowered Nu ez' total offense level from 43, CHC I\r\n(life imprisonment),  to 41,  CHC I  (324-405 months),  see supra\r                                                                           \r\nnote 2, any error could not be considered harmless.  \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nbefore  the  scheduled  trial,  thereby  presumably  leaving  the\r\n\ngovernment no alternative but to prepare for trial.  See U.S.S.G.\r                                                                  \r\n\n  3E1.1, comment. (n.1(g)) (court considers timeliness of defend-\r\n\nant's manifestation of acceptance of responsibility) (Nov. 1994).\r\n\nSecond, the  court noted that  during the six-month  delay, Nu ez\r\n\nhad offered inconsistent versions  of the relevant events.5   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.  comment. (n.1(a)) (court considers whether defendant \"truth-\r             \r\n\nfully  admitt[ed] the offense  comprising the offense  of convic-\r\n\ntion.\").  Since a  guilty plea does not entitle a  defendant to a\r\n\ndownward adjustment under   3E1.1,  see id. comment (n.3) (guilty\r                                                     \r\n\nplea  and  \"truthful  admission\"  are \"significant  evidence\"  of\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility but \"may be outweighed by [inconsis-\r\n\ntent] conduct of the defendant .  . .\"), normally a trial court's\r\n\ndecision to deny a   3E1.1 adjustment would be affirmed  on these\r\n\ngrounds.   Id.  comment. (n.  5) (\"The  sentencing judge is  in a\r                        \r\n\nunique position to evaluate a defendant's acceptance of responsi-\r\n\nbility.   For this  reason, the  determination of  the sentencing\r\n\njudge is entitled to great deference on review.\").\r\n\n          The district  court  made other  statements during  the\r\n\nsentencing hearing,  however, which are  reasonably understood to\r\n\nindicate that the court declined a   3E1.1 adjustment on an inde-\r\n\npendent  ground; that is,  Nu ez' purported inability  or ongoing\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Initially, Nunez told the FBI  that he had been abducted by\r\nan unidentified male, forced at gunpoint to drive to the victim's\r\nresidence,  then forced to  drive the Pierluisi  vehicle from the\r\nmurder scene.  Later, Nunez told the FBI that while visiting at a\r\nfriend's apartment,  he had  encountered a  group of  persons who\r\npersuaded him to assist in the prison break scheme. \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nrefusal to  disclose the  names of other  collaborators.   As the\r\n\nprecise import of the district court's statements in  this regard\r\n\nis critical, we recite its statements at length.  \r\n\n          After describing,  as incredible, Nu ez'  initial story\r\n\nthat he had been abducted by armed strangers, see supra p. 3, the\r                                                                 \r\n\ndistrict court observed: \r\n\n               A defendant  who accepts  responsibility\r\n          must  do more than that when he's involved in\r\n          a conspiracy and  where [] human life  is in-\r\n          volved.   He must  come forward  and identify\r\n          and help  authorities get  the other  people.\r\n          He has  stated time  and time  again that  he\r\n          doesn't know these other people.\r\n\n               Now,  he spent  with  these people  some\r\n          hours  in an apartment, planning a crime.  He\r\n          drives around . . . cruising in the rear seat\r\n          while  he is telling the public and the Court\r\n          that he was forced . .  . to sit on the front\r\n          seat with the  gun pointed at  him.  When  he\r\n          stepped out of  the car, the other .  . . un-\r\n          identified male  got out  of the  car with  a\r\n          gun.   Now, we don't know whether [Nu ez] was\r\n          wearing  [or] carrying the  gun, or the other\r\n          people [were], . . . because the track record\r\n          of  this defendant is  that he cannot  be be-\r\n          lieved.\r\n\n               And therefore for those  reasons I'm not\r                                                \r\n          accepting the two-points  downward adjustment\r\n          for  acceptance of  responsibility.   I don't\r\n          think the defendant  has done that.   When he\r\n          comes forward  and identifies the  other peo-\r\n          ple,  if he does  that, then that  might be a\r                                                               \r\n          different story.  But  he's protecting others\r\n          and that's why he has done all these things.\r\n\nTr. at 39-40 (emphasis added).   Later, once again after discuss-\r\n\ning Nu ez' inconsistent  versions of the relevant  events on June\r\n\n7, 1994, the district court observed: \r\n\n          [In his  second version,]  Nunez rode in  the\r\n          rear seat.   So there  was no one  pointing a\r\n          gun at him.  And  for four hours, if he tells\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n          the court  and the authorities that he hasn't\r\n              he cannot recognize those two    at least\r\n          those other two individuals, I'm not going to\r\n          buy  that. . .  . Nunez turned  several items\r\n          [of the victim's property]  over to those who\r\n          he  had  originally  met  at  the  apartment.\r\n          Again,  how could he say that he cannot iden-\r\n          tify those  people?   He is protecting  them.\r\n          And I  know it.   I'm pointing to  the defen-\r\n          dant.\r\n\nTr. at 43-44.   Nu ez responded:  \"I'm afraid.\" The court did not\r\n\nrespond. \r\n\n          Later, in summarizing  its guidelines sentencing calcu-\r\n\nlations, the district court added:\r\n\n          The defendant has not  identified    although\r\n          the  court finds  that he  can     the  other\r\n          individuals  who participated  in the  crime.\r\n          These are considered to have been elements of\r\n          a strategy  to manipulate  the judicial  pro-\r\n          ceedings, among other  things, towards estab-\r\n          lishing a  tailor-made plea  agreement condi-\r\n          tioned  on his own terms, failing to yield to\r\n          this sort of  bargain, and  this occurred  at\r\n          the beginning where  the defendant said  I'll\r\n          plead guilty if I get \"X\" type of  sentence .\r\n          . . .  A  defendant qualifies for a [  3E1.1]\r\n          reduction when he truthfully  admits the con-\r\n          duct comprising the offense of conviction and\r\n          does not falsely  deny or frivolously contest\r\n          relevant conduct  that the  Court has  deter-\r\n          mined to  be true and  also does not  keep to\r\n          himself the identity of other coconspirators.\r\n\nTr. at  46-47.  After  defense counsel objected to  its consider-\r\n\nation of the \"informer\" criterion, the district court responded:\r\n\n          [M]y  point is that if anyone commits a crime\r                                                 \r\n          with one or more persons, knowing  those per-\r\n          sons, does  not come forward to  the authori-\r                                                \r\n          ties, giving the names of those persons, then\r                                                           \r\n          you cannot have a  full acceptance of respon-\r                                                                 \r\n          sibility because that entails precisely a ca-\r                            \r\n          tharsis,  a full  remorse  by disclosing  the\r\n          whole thing, being truthful  and not conceal-\r\n          ing any  information how  to identify  . .  .\r\n          these defendants.

You\r\n          have one year to think about  it . . . and to\r\n          cooperate with the authorities.  But I'm  not\r\n          saying that if you do that I will reconsider,\r\n          but  your counsel knows better than I that   \r\n          . . . what I  mean. . . . All I'm     all I'm\r\n          saying,  counsel    I want to make the record\r\n          clear     is that there  is what is  called a\r\n          downward departure.  I ruled that there is no\r\n          departure, either upward  or downward, right?\r\n          . . .  Very well.  And I am saying that there\r\n          is what is  called a downward  departure, and\r\n          that's up to  the defendant to avail  of that\r\n          of himself, punto, without anything else. . .\r\n          . I'm not  saying he is getting  life because\r\n          of that.

Moreover, the U.S.S.G.  \r\n\n3E1.1  commentary expressly provides that its listing of relevant\r\n\nconsiderations for a two-point adjustment under subsection (a) is\r\n\nnonexhaustive.    See  U.S.S.G.    3E1.1,  comment.

Talladino, 38 F.3d 1255, 1258\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1994).    Moreover,  by  prescribing  a  nonexhaustive\r\n\nlisting  in its commentary,  the Sentencing Commission  left sen-\r\n\ntencing courts the  latitude to consider all  reliable, probative\r\n\nindicia tending  to demonstrate, or countervail,  the genuineness\r\n\nof the particular defendant's remorse.       We  can  discern  no\r\n\nsound basis for  a general rule  barring a defendant's  voluntary\r\n\ncooperation  in truthfully  identifying criminal  associates from\r\n\nconsideration by the sentencing court in determining the genuine-\r\n\nness of the  defendant's remorse.

Nor do we think\r\n\nthis basic premise  is rendered unsound by the  concern that \"[a]\r\n\ncunning but not contrite defendant may buy his way out of trouble\r\n\nby  providing  evidence  against someone  else,  and  an entirely\r\n\ncontrite  defendant may  out of  fear,  ignorance of  information\r\n\nuseful  to  the prosecutors,  or  other reason,  fail  to provide\r\n\nassistance.\"  Vance, 62 F.3d at 1157.  To be sure,  such \"inform-\r                             \r\n\ning\" will  not always prove  a reliable or bona  fide indicium of\r                                                               \r\n\nthe defendant's  remorse.   Be that as  it may,  however, similar\r\n\ncredibility determinations and inferential findings are consigned\r\n\nroutinely to  sentencing courts,  and, without  more, present  no\r\n\nsound basis  for a per  se rule barring the  \"informer\" criterion\r                                    \r\n\nfrom consideration  under section  3E1.1, as one  more among  the\r\n\ntotality of the circumstances that the sentencing court considers\r\n\nin  assessing a defendant's  true motives for  \"informing\" (e.g.,\r\n\nsentence manipulation),  or not  \"informing\" (e.g.,  lack of  re-\r\n\nmorse, inability  to inform,  desire to  protect accomplices  for\r\n\npersonal or illicit reasons, or genuine fear of retaliation).    \r\n\n          Nu ez  suggests,  however,  that the  narrowly  focused\r\n\nlanguage  in  U.S.S.G.     3E1.1(b)  (three-point  reduction  for\r\n\nacceptance  of responsibility)  requiring, inter  alia, that  the\r                                                                \r\n\ndefendant \"timely provid[e]  complete information to the  govern-\r\n\nment concerning  his own involvement  in the offense,\"  see supra\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nnote 1,  necessarily forecloses  consideration of the  \"informer\"\r\n\ncriterion under section 3E1.1.  We  do not agree.  Subsection (b)\r\n\nrequires  that a  defendant  first  meet  the  relevant  criteria\r                                            \r\n\nprescribed  in subsection (a), and since the \"informer\" criterion\r\n\nis  not  barred  by the  nonexhaustive  listing  included  in the\r\n\nCommission  commentary to subsection  (a), see U.S.S.G.    3E1.1,\r                                                        \r\n\ncomment. (n.1(a)-(g)), it may be weighed in the balance under the\r\n\nthreshold subsection (a) inquiry.  Nothing in subsection 3E1.1(b)\r\n\npurports  to supplant  the requirements of  subsection (a).   In-\r\n\nstead,  the  subsection  (a)  requirements  are  explicitly  made\r\n\nindependent.  Thus, there is no sound basis for the view that the\r\n\nimposition  of additional requirements  in subsection  (b) alters\r\n\nthe threshold factors appropriate for consideration under subsec-\r\n\ntion (a).   A defendant must satisfy either  subsection (b)(1) or\r\n\n(b)(2), as well  as subsection (a), in  order to qualify  for the\r\n\nextra-point adjustment permitted under   3B1.1(b).  \r\n\n          Section  5K1.1  likewise  focuses  on  the   \"informer\"\r\n\ncriterion, even  to the exclusion of other  criteria, and imposes\r\n\nadditional  conditions precedent to  sentence mitigation  such as\r\n\nthe  requirement that  a  defendant's cooperation  in identifying\r\n\naccomplices be sufficiently comprehensive to constitute \"substan-\r\n\ntial assistance\" as certified by a government motion recommending\r\n\na downward  departure.

(n.2) (emphasis added).  \r\n\n          At  first blush  this commentary  may  seem to  support\r\n\nNu ez'  contention, but  it is far  from conclusive.   At most it\r\n\nindicates  simply that  the  sentencing  court  is  to  undertake\r\n\nsequential  inquiries under sections  3E1.1 and 5K1.1,  since the\r                    \r\n\ntwo independent  standards require the court to balance and weigh\r\n\ndifferent  criteria.   Unlike  section  5K1.1, moreover,  section\r\n\n3E1.1 requires  the sentencing  court to  balance many  divergent\r                                                                \r\n\nfactors, consistent and inconsistent with acceptance of responsi-\r\n\nbility.  Nothing in application note 2 to section 5K1.1 suggests,\r\n\nhowever, that these sequential inquiries may not involve overlap-\r\n\nping  criteria,  in  particular the  \"informer\"  criterion.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States v. Singh, 923 F.2d  1039, 1044 (3d Cir.)

For example,  assistance in\r\n\nidentifying,  apprehending,  or   prosecuting  accomplices  might\r\n\nbuttress a  cooperating defendant's statements  of remorse  under\r\n\nsection 3E1.1, without regard to whether the government considers\r\n\nthe cooperation  sufficiently helpful  to warrant a  \"substantial\r\n\nassistance\" departure under section 5K1.1.\r\n\n          Finally, section  5K1.2 provides that  \"[a] defendant's\r\n\nrefusal  to  assist  authorities in  the  investigation  of other\r\n\npersons  may not  be  considered  as  an  aggravating  sentencing\r\n\nfactor.\"  The October 1988 version of U.S.S.G.   5K1.2 included a\r\n\nsingle commentary:  \"The Commission .  . . rejected the use of  a\r\n\ndefendant's  refusal to  assist  authorities  as  an  aggravating\r\n\nsentencing  factor.

First,  given its\r\n\nlocation in  the  guidelines section  dealing with  \"departures,\"\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nsection 5K1.2 clearly  forbids reliance on a  defendant's failure\r\n\nto identify accomplices as a basis  for an upward departure.  But\r                                                                     \r\n\nit  neither expressly  nor impliedly  forbids  such reliance  for\r\n\npurposes of sentencing adjustments such as section 3E1.1.  In all\r                                            \r\n\nevents, since  any adjustment  under section  3E1.1  can only  be\r\n\ndownward,  the \"informer\" criterion under section 3E1.1 can never\r                  \r\n\nconstitute  an aggravating  sentencing factor, only  a mitigating\r\n\nfactor. See, e.g., United States  v. Gordon, 895 F.2d 932, 936-37\r                                                     \r\n\n(4th Cir.)

Significantly, the\r\n\n1988 version purported to allow the court to deny a section 3E1.1\r\n\nadjustment  where  the  defendant did  not  identify  accomplices\r\n\nbecause  his criminal  associations were  ongoing.   Further,  it\r\n\nseems  that the 1989  amendment deleted the  \"unclear\" commentary\r\n\nnot because the Commission had  altered its view on the propriety\r\n\nof the  section 3E1.1 practice  described in the  commentary, but\r\n\nbecause it concluded that the  current text in sections 3E1.1 and\r\n\n5K1.1 was sufficiently clear to  support such a sentencing  prac-\r\n\ntice     without further elaboration.  We therefore conclude that\r\n\nthe 1989 amendment was meant to clarify, not to effect a substan-\r\n\ntive change in sentencing policy.  See United States v. Campbell,\r                                                                          \r\n\n61  F.3d 976,  985 (1st  Cir.  1995) (court  should presume  that\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nCommission  did  not  intend substantive  change  where guideline\r\n\namendments are  unaccompanied by language declaring  intention to\r\n\nabandon  earlier sentencing practice),  cert. denied, 116  S.

This  conclusion is confirmed  by the Commission's\r\n\nfailure to  effect a  conforming 1989  modification  to the  non-\r\n\nexhaustive listing in section 3E1.1.  See supra note 8.\r                                                         \r\n\n           Insofar as  McKinney,  Vance,  and  Leonard  might  be\r                                                                \r\n\nthought to suggest  a per se rule,  but see McKinney, 15  F.3d at\r                                                              \r\n\n854 (\"Where the defendant's refusal to assist authorities in  the\r\n\nprosecution of his  codefendants does not detract  from his clear\r\n\ncontrition  for his  own actions,  he  is still  entitled to  the\r\n\nacceptance of responsibility  reduction.\"), we must  respectfully\r\n\ndisagree.   In appropriate  circumstances a  sentencing court  is\r\n\npermitted  to consider, as  relevant evidence of  the defendant's\r\n\nsincerity  in accepting  responsibility for  his  own crimes,  at\r\n\nleast whether  a defendant truthfully has  identified accomplices\r\n\nin the  crimes  to which  the  defendant has  pled  guilty.   For\r\n\nexample,  where a defendant does not disclose accomplices because\r\n\nhe has  elected to continue  his criminal associations,  the sen-\r\n\ntencing  court may  consider  such conduct  along with  any other\r\n\nindicia of failure to accept  responsibility.  On the other hand,\r\n\nshould  the court determine  that a defendant  has not identified\r\n\nhis  accomplices because he genuinely fears retaliation, but that\r\n\nthe defendant's conduct otherwise demonstrates genuine remorse, a\r\n\ndownward adjustment under section 3E1.1 might yet be found appro-\r\n\npriate, as the  sentencing court's balancing and  weighing of the\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nrelevant criteria under section 3E1.1 is entitled to great defer-\r\n\nence on appeal.

(n.1(g)) (timeliness\r                           \r\n\nfactor), and  (ii) the inconsistent  stories given by  Nu ez, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. (n.1(a)) (truthful-admission factor).  \r             \r\n\n          In addition, the district  court discussed at consider-\r\n\nable length Nu ez'  failure to assist the FBI  in identifying his\r\n\naccomplices.  See  supra Section II.A.1.  The court appropriately\r                                  \r\n\nquestioned  Nu ez' motives for  not disclosing the  identities of\r\n\nhis associates.  Its misgivings were prompted by Nu ez' inconsis-\r\n\ntent versions of the carjacking, and were explicitly connected to\r\n\nits finding that Nu ez, and  by extension, his insistence that he\r\n\nhad accepted responsibility, were not  credible.  Nu ez had given\r\n\nuncorroborated and inconsistent explanations  for not identifying\r\n\nhis  accomplices:  first,  he claimed that he  had not known them\r\n\nbefore the day of the  carjacking, and never learned their names;\r\n\nand, second, he was \"afraid\" to  identify them.  See Gonzalez, 12\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 300 (defendant bears burden of proof under   3E1.1).  The\r\n\ndistrict court supportably found  that Nu ez' true motive was  to\r\n\n\"protect\" his accomplices,  a motive which     when coupled  with\r                                                                     \r\n\nhis two pretextual motives for refusing to \"inform\" (memory lapse\r\n\nand/or fear)    belied a genuine acceptance of responsibility.  \r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\n          Nonetheless, other  observations by the  district court\r\n\nremain open to the plausible understanding that a  defendant must\r\n\nalways, at least  where an offense results in  death, \"inform\" on\r                \r\n\nhis accomplices  in order  to qualify for  a    3E1.1 adjustment,\r\n\nregardless of any other circumstances in the case: \r\n\n               A defendant  who accepts  responsibility\r\n          must  do more than that when he's involved in\r                        \r\n          a conspiracy and  where [] human life  is in-\r                                                                 \r\n          volved.

Conse-\r                                                 \r\n\nquently, we are  unable to conclude  with confidence whether  the\r\n\ndistrict court  deemed Nu ez'  failure to  identify his  criminal\r\n\nassociates  as sufficient, by  itself, to preclude  an adjustment\r\n\nunder section  3E1.1, without  regard to  whether Nu ez knew  the\r\n\nnames of his accomplices or feared retaliation. \r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\n          Assuming  the  district  court  meant  that  mitigating\r\n\nconsiderations  are never material under section 3E1.1, it erred.\r\n\nMoreover, insofar as  the court envisioned  a per se  bar to  its\r                                                              \r\n\nconsideration  of mitigating  circumstances,  the present  record\r\n\nprecludes reliable \"harmless error\" analysis, since we cannot say\r\n\nwith any  confidence that the  court would not have  disallowed a\r\n\nsection 3E1.1 adjustment solely because Nu ez refused to identify\r\n\nhis criminal associates. \r\n\n          The government  points to the district  court statement\r\n\nthat it was  \"not saying [Nu ez] is getting life because of . . .\r                                                                     \r\n\n[his  failure to  `inform'].\"    Yet the  literal  import of  the\r\n\ndistrict court's  language is  not necessarily  equivalent to  an\r\n\nassurance that  Nu ez' life sentence  had nothing to do  with his\r\n\nrefusal to  identify his criminal  associates.  Thus,  the quoted\r\n\nstatement does not  cure the  inherent ambiguity  created by  the\r\n\ncategorical remarks the court made earlier.  Consequently, on the\r\n\nrecord as  a whole,  we cannot  say that  we are  left \"with  the\r\n\ndefinite  and firm conviction  that removal of  the inappropriate\r\n\nground would not be likely to alter the  district court's view of\r\n\nthe sentence  rightfully to be  imposed.\"  See  Diaz, 39 F.3d  at\r                                                              \r\n\n568.   These ambiguities  counsel a  remand for resentencing  for\r\n\nclarification,9 and further factfinding  as appropriate.

It  noted, based  on  a review  of the  Rule 11\r\nhearing transcript  that Nu ez had  asked to be \"forgiven  by the\r\n[victim's]  family,\" but \"didn't  say he was  remorseful, that he\r\nwas willing to cooperate.\"   Tr. at 39.  Our review of  the tran-\r\nscript discloses that  Nu ez stated:  \"I  would like to  ask for-\r\ngiveness from the family of the young man, (defendant crying).

See  U.S.S.G.   3B1.2(b).10   Nu ez claims it was  an\r                         \r\n\nerror  of law  to assess  his  participation exclusively  through\r\n\nreference to the hypothetical \"average participant\" in a carjack-\r\n\ning and murder, rather than with reference to his coconspirators.\r\n\nSee  United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 460 (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 115 S. Ct. 80 (1994); United States v.

Thus, the district court's  compound state-\r\nment  (\"didn't say  he was  remorseful,  that he  was willing  to\r\ncooperate\") may  have been  either yet  another reference to  the\r\nsection 3E1.1 \"informer\"  criterion, or simply a  mistaken under-\r\nstanding that Nu ez had never even stated that he  was \"sorry\" at\r                                                   \r\nthe time he pled  guilty.  The present record does  not permit us\r\nto make a reliable determination. \r\n\n     10\"A minor  participant means  any participant  who is  less\r\nculpable  than most  other  participants.\"    U.S.S.G.     3B1.2,\r\ncomment.

An adjustment  is allowed \"for a  defendant who\r\nplays a  part in committing  the offense that makes  him substan-\r\ntially less culpable than the  average participant.\" Id.   3B1.2,\r                                                                  \r\ncomment.

Rather he must be less culpable than the\r\n\naverage  participant in  similar  offenses.\"   (Emphasis  added.)\r\n\nThis  statement      especially the  phrase  \"merely  because\"   \r\n\nnegates  the  suggestion  that the  district  court  found actual\r\n\ncoconspirator  comparisons  immaterial  to  the  Brandon-Gregorio\r                                                                           \r\n\ninquiry.  Instead,  the court acknowledged, as it  explained more\r\n\nfully later,  that U.S.S.G.    3B1.2(b) entails a  bifocal analy-\r\n\nsis.11  \r\n\n          We also  reject the  claim that  the evidence  does not\r\n\nsupport  the district court ruling.   Its fact-specific ruling is\r\n\nreviewed  for clear error  only, and with  \"considerable respect\"\r\n\nfor a sentencing court's superior  vantage point.

The evidence revealed\r\n\nthat Nu ez voluntarily  participated in planning the  jail break-\r\n\nout,  witnessed the  delivery of  a  revolver to  be used  in the\r\n\ncarjacking,  drove  around with  two  coconspirators  for several\r\n\nhours searching for an appropriate vehicle, approached the victim\r\n\nwith  an armed  associate,  and, as  agreed, drove  the Pierluisi\r\n\nvehicle from the carjacking scene, despite having heard the fatal\r\n\ngunshot.   Finally, the  evidence indicates  that Nu ez  played a\r\n\nmore active role in the carjacking-murder than at least one other\r\n\nassociate, who merely  waited in the car while  the shooter, with\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11The  court  stated:   \"In  this case  [Nu ez]  planned the\r\noffense.

(emphasis  added).  Essentially, Nu ez\r\n\nrelied on a  1984 diagnosis of borderline  mental retardation and\r\n\nparanoid schizophrenia, which conditions  so affected his ability\r\n\nto make common-sense judgments, that  he was unable to resist his\r\n\ncoconspirators' requests that he join in the armed carjacking, or\r\n\nto  foresee that  a  murder  might ensue.    Recognizing that  we\r\n\nnormally lack jurisdiction  to review a district  court's discre-\r\n\ntionary refusal to make  a downward departure, see United  States\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Grandmaison, 77  F.3d 555, 560 (1st Cir.  1996), Nu ez instead\r                        \r\n\nargues that  the court's  refusal to depart  was premised  on its\r\n\nincorrect  interpretation of  the  phrase \"non-violent  offense.\"\r\n\nId.12\r             \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12In essence, Nunez  argues that there  is an inherent  con-\r\nflict  between    2A1.1 and 5K2.13.  The former section increased\r\nNunez' base  offense level from  22 to 43 because  death resulted\r\nfrom  the  carjacking.   See  U.S.S.G.    2A1.1,  comment. (n.1);\r                                      \r\n2B3.1(c).   Section 2A1.1  also notes,  however, that  a downward\r\ndeparture may be warranted where \"the defendant did not cause the\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\n          We need not linger over  this claim.  Without regard to\r\n\nwhether  the district court  misapprehended the meaning  of \"non-\r\n\nviolent crime,\" see, e.g., United  States v. Weddle, 30 F.3d 532,\r                                                             \r\n\n537-40  (4th  Cir.  1994)  (discussing circuit  split  concerning\r\n\nproper  interpretation of  \"non-violent  offense\"), it  expressly\r\n\nruled      after defense  counsel cited  to the  1984 psychiatric\r\n\nreports    that  it believed  Nu ez did not  suffer from the  re-\r\n\nquired \"significantly reduced mental capacity\" at the time of the\r\n\n1994 carjacking:\r\n\n          This  defendant  had  this meeting  with  his\r\n          friend's  nephew where they sat there in this\r\n          apartment discussing precisely  a carjacking,\r\n          stealing of  a car,  to commit another  crime\r\n          [i.e., the  jail  break], and  he was  there.\r\n          And then they start cruising around,  finding\r\n          a  victim until  they  found him,  found  the\r\n          victim.

The\r\n\nconspirators  agreed to search  out a vehicle  bearing government\r\n\nlicense plates  to  facilitate the  planned entry  upon the  jail\r\n\npremises.   During their meeting,  Nu ez saw an  associate accept\r\n\ndelivery of  a handgun.   Later the  same evening,  after driving\r\n\naround San  Juan  for several  hours,  Nu ez and  two  associates\r\n\nspotted Jos   Jaime Pierluisi-Urrutia  (\"Pierluisi\"), brother  of\r\n\nthe Secretary of  Justice of the Commonwealth of  Puerto Rico, as\r\n\nhe returned home around midnight in a car with government plates.\r\n\n          After parking their own car, Nu ez and an associate ap-\r\n\nproached the  unsuspecting Pierluisi  as he  began unloading  the\r\n\ntrunk.  The  associate brandished a handgun and  demanded the car\r\n\nkeys.   After relinquishing  the keys without  protest, Pierluisi\r\n\nwas summarily  murdered by the associate with  a shot to the back\r\n\nof  his head  as Nu ez  prepared to  drive away in  the Pierluisi\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nvehicle.  Following the murder, Nu ez drove the Pierluisi vehicle\r\n\nto the housing development where he lived. \r\n\n          The  next day,  after learning  that the  FBI  had been\r\n\ninquiring  as to  his whereabouts,  Nu ez  presented himself  for\r\n\nquestioning.  Although he readily admitted his involvement in the\r\n\ncarjacking,  he steadfastly maintained that he had been abducted,\r\n\nthreatened  with a  gun, and  forced  to participate.   During  a\r\n\nsubsequent consensual search of the apartment where he lived, FBI\r\n\nagents seized a  briefcase and passport, as well  as clothing and\r\n\ncredit cards, belonging to the victim.  \r\n\n          After  Nu ez was indicted, he offered to cooperate with\r\n\nthe  government provided he received total immunity from prosecu-\r\n\ntion.  More than seven months after his confession, and less than\r\n\na week prior to the scheduled trial, Nu ez finally pled guilty to\r\n\nthe  charges without  the benefit  of a  plea agreement.   Subse-\r\n\nquently he  filed a pro se motion to  set aside his guilty pleas,\r                                    \r\n\nwhich he withdrew following the  appointment of new counsel.  The\r\n\ndistrict court ultimately  sentenced Nu ez  to life  imprisonment\r\n\nplus  sixty  months,  after  refusing  downward  adjustments  for\r\n\nacceptance  of  responsibility  and  \"minor  participation,\"  and\r\n\nrejecting a downward  departure request based on  \"reduced mental\r\n\ncapacity.\" \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nA.   \"Acceptance of Responsibility\" (U.S.S.G.   3E1.1)1\r          A.   \"Acceptance of Responsibility\" (U.S.S.G.   3E1.1)1\r                                                               \r\n\n          Nu ez first contends that  the district court committed\r\n\nreversible  error in  refusing  to  adopt  a  presentence  report\r\n\n(\"PSR\") recommendation that  he receive  a three-point  reduction\r\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.2 \r\n\n          Nu ez maintains that he  met his burden of  proof under\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Nunez  was sentenced  under the  November  1994 guidelines,\r\nwherein   3E1.1 provided:\r\n\n          (a) If  the defendant clearly  demonstrates accep-\r\n     tance of  responsibility for his offense,  decrease the\r\n     offense level by 2 levels.\r\n\n          (b)  If  the  defendant qualifies  for  a decrease\r\n     under  subsection  (a),  the  offense level  determined\r\n     prior to the operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or\r\n     greater, and the defendant has assisted authorities  in\r\n     the investigation or prosecution  of his own misconduct\r\n     by taking one or more of the following steps:\r\n\n               (1) timely providing  complete information to\r\n          the government  concerning his own  involvement in\r\n          the offense; or\r\n\n               (2) timely  notifying authorities of  his in-\r\n          tention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permit-\r\n          ting the government  to avoid preparing for  trial\r\n          and permitting the court to allocate its resources\r\n          efficiently,\r\n\n     decrease the offense level by 1 additional level.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   3E1.1 (Nov. 1994).\r\n\n     2The claimed entitlement to  a three-point downward  adjust-\r                                                   \r\nment for acceptance  of responsibility under U.S.S.G.    3E1.1(b)\r\nis  frivolous, since  the undisputed  evidence unmistakably  dis-\r\nclosed  that  Nu ez  provided  neither  \"timely\"  nor  \"complete\"\r\ninformation to the  government concerning his own  involvement in\r\nthe  offense.

Nu ez\r\n\nfurther  contends that  the district  court erred  by  relying on\r\n\nother factors it deemed \"inconsistent\" with acceptance of respon-\r\n\nsibility,  including  Nu ez' continuing  and  willful failure  to\r\n\ndisclose the  names of  some of his  accomplices.3   This factor,\r\n\nNu ez maintains, can  be relevant only to a  defendant's entitle-\r                                                \r\n\nment to a   5K1.1  downward departure for \"substantial assistance\r\n\nto [law enforcement] authorities.\" See U.S.S.G.   5K1.1.4\r                                                \r\n\n     1.

First,\r\n\nNu ez delayed  his guilty  plea for six  months, until  five days\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Nunez did provide the first names of two accomplices.\r\n\n     4Because a two-point  offense-level reduction under    3E1.-\r\n1(b) would have lowered Nu ez' total offense level from 43, CHC I\r\n(life imprisonment),  to 41,  CHC I  (324-405 months),  see supra\r                                                                           \r\nnote 2, any error could not be considered harmless.  \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nbefore  the  scheduled  trial,  thereby  presumably  leaving  the\r\n\ngovernment no alternative but to prepare for trial.  See U.S.S.G.\r                                                                  \r\n\n  3E1.1, comment.

Later, Nunez told the FBI that while visiting at a\r\nfriend's apartment,  he had  encountered a  group of  persons who\r\npersuaded him to assist in the prison break scheme. \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nrefusal to  disclose the  names of other  collaborators.   As the\r\n\nprecise import of the district court's statements in  this regard\r\n\nis critical, we recite its statements at length.  \r\n\n          After describing,  as incredible, Nu ez'  initial story\r\n\nthat he had been abducted by armed strangers, see supra p. 3, the\r                                                                 \r\n\ndistrict court observed: \r\n\n               A defendant  who accepts  responsibility\r\n          must  do more than that when he's involved in\r\n          a conspiracy and  where [] human life  is in-\r\n          volved.   He must  come forward  and identify\r\n          and help  authorities get  the other  people.\r\n          He has  stated time  and time  again that  he\r\n          doesn't know these other people.\r\n\n               Now,  he spent  with  these people  some\r\n          hours  in an apartment, planning a crime.  He\r\n          drives around . . . cruising in the rear seat\r\n          while  he is telling the public and the Court\r\n          that he was forced . .  . to sit on the front\r\n          seat with the  gun pointed at  him.  When  he\r\n          stepped out of  the car, the other .  . . un-\r\n          identified male  got out  of the  car with  a\r\n          gun.   Now, we don't know whether [Nu ez] was\r\n          wearing  [or] carrying the  gun, or the other\r\n          people [were], . . . because the track record\r\n          of  this defendant is  that he cannot  be be-\r\n          lieved.\r\n\n               And therefore for those  reasons I'm not\r                                                \r\n          accepting the two-points  downward adjustment\r\n          for  acceptance of  responsibility.   I don't\r\n          think the defendant  has done that.

Later, once again after discuss-\r\n\ning Nu ez' inconsistent  versions of the relevant  events on June\r\n\n7, 1994, the district court observed: \r\n\n          [In his  second version,]  Nunez rode in  the\r\n          rear seat.   So there  was no one  pointing a\r\n          gun at him.  And  for four hours, if he tells\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\n          the court  and the authorities that he hasn't\r\n              he cannot recognize those two    at least\r\n          those other two individuals, I'm not going to\r\n          buy  that. . .  . Nunez turned  several items\r\n          [of the victim's property]  over to those who\r\n          he  had  originally  met  at  the  apartment.\r\n          Again,  how could he say that he cannot iden-\r\n          tify those  people?   He is protecting  them.\r\n          And I  know it.   I'm pointing to  the defen-\r\n          dant.\r\n\nTr. at 43-44.   Nu ez responded:  \"I'm afraid.\" The court did not\r\n\nrespond. \r\n\n          Later, in summarizing  its guidelines sentencing calcu-\r\n\nlations, the district court added:\r\n\n          The defendant has not  identified    although\r\n          the  court finds  that he  can     the  other\r\n          individuals  who participated  in the  crime.\r\n          These are considered to have been elements of\r\n          a strategy  to manipulate  the judicial  pro-\r\n          ceedings, among other  things, towards estab-\r\n          lishing a  tailor-made plea  agreement condi-\r\n          tioned  on his own terms, failing to yield to\r\n          this sort of  bargain, and  this occurred  at\r\n          the beginning where  the defendant said  I'll\r\n          plead guilty if I get \"X\" type of  sentence .\r\n          . . .  A  defendant qualifies for a [  3E1.1]\r\n          reduction when he truthfully  admits the con-\r\n          duct comprising the offense of conviction and\r\n          does not falsely  deny or frivolously contest\r\n          relevant conduct  that the  Court has  deter-\r\n          mined to  be true and  also does not  keep to\r\n          himself the identity of other coconspirators.\r\n\nTr. at  46-47.  After  defense counsel objected to  its consider-\r\n\nation of the \"informer\" criterion, the district court responded:\r\n\n          [M]y  point is that if anyone commits a crime\r                                                 \r\n          with one or more persons, knowing  those per-\r\n          sons, does  not come forward to  the authori-\r                                                \r\n          ties, giving the names of those persons, then\r                                                           \r\n          you cannot have a  full acceptance of respon-\r                                                                 \r\n          sibility because that entails precisely a ca-\r                            \r\n          tharsis,  a full  remorse  by disclosing  the\r\n          whole thing, being truthful  and not conceal-\r\n          ing any  information how  to identify  . .  .\r\n          these defendants.   I  have to  say that  for\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\n          defendant's benefit  that there is  a section\r\n          5K in this statute.   There's a Rule 35.  You\r\n          have one year to think about  it . . . and to\r\n          cooperate with the authorities.  But I'm  not\r\n          saying that if you do that I will reconsider,\r\n          but  your counsel knows better than I that   \r\n          . . . what I  mean. . . . All I'm     all I'm\r\n          saying,  counsel    I want to make the record\r\n          clear     is that there  is what is  called a\r\n          downward departure.  I ruled that there is no\r\n          departure, either upward  or downward, right?\r\n          . . .  Very well.  And I am saying that there\r\n          is what is  called a downward  departure, and\r\n          that's up to  the defendant to avail  of that\r\n          of himself, punto, without anything else. . .\r\n          . I'm not  saying he is getting  life because\r\n          of that.

To be sure,  such \"inform-\r                             \r\n\ning\" will  not always prove  a reliable or bona  fide indicium of\r                                                               \r\n\nthe defendant's  remorse.   Be that as  it may,  however, similar\r\n\ncredibility determinations and inferential findings are consigned\r\n\nroutinely to  sentencing courts,  and, without  more, present  no\r\n\nsound basis  for a per  se rule barring the  \"informer\" criterion\r                                    \r\n\nfrom consideration  under section  3E1.1, as one  more among  the\r\n\ntotality of the circumstances that the sentencing court considers\r\n\nin  assessing a defendant's  true motives for  \"informing\" (e.g.,\r\n\nsentence manipulation),  or not  \"informing\" (e.g.,  lack of  re-\r\n\nmorse, inability  to inform,  desire to  protect accomplices  for\r\n\npersonal or illicit reasons, or genuine fear of retaliation).    \r\n\n          Nu ez  suggests,  however,  that the  narrowly  focused\r\n\nlanguage  in  U.S.S.G.     3E1.1(b)  (three-point  reduction  for\r\n\nacceptance  of responsibility)  requiring, inter  alia, that  the\r                                                                \r\n\ndefendant \"timely provid[e]  complete information to the  govern-\r\n\nment concerning  his own involvement  in the offense,\"  see supra\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nnote 1,  necessarily forecloses  consideration of the  \"informer\"\r\n\ncriterion under section 3E1.1.  We  do not agree.  Subsection (b)\r\n\nrequires  that a  defendant  first  meet  the  relevant  criteria\r                                            \r\n\nprescribed  in subsection (a), and since the \"informer\" criterion\r\n\nis  not  barred  by the  nonexhaustive  listing  included  in the\r\n\nCommission  commentary to subsection  (a), see U.S.S.G.    3E1.1,\r                                                        \r\n\ncomment. (n.1(a)-(g)), it may be weighed in the balance under the\r\n\nthreshold subsection (a) inquiry.  Nothing in subsection 3E1.1(b)\r\n\npurports  to supplant  the requirements of  subsection (a).   In-\r\n\nstead,  the  subsection  (a)  requirements  are  explicitly  made\r\n\nindependent.  Thus, there is no sound basis for the view that the\r\n\nimposition  of additional requirements  in subsection  (b) alters\r\n\nthe threshold factors appropriate for consideration under subsec-\r\n\ntion (a).   A defendant must satisfy either  subsection (b)(1) or\r\n\n(b)(2), as well  as subsection (a), in  order to qualify  for the\r\n\nextra-point adjustment permitted under   3B1.1(b).  \r\n\n          Section  5K1.1  likewise  focuses  on  the   \"informer\"\r\n\ncriterion, even  to the exclusion of other  criteria, and imposes\r\n\nadditional  conditions precedent to  sentence mitigation  such as\r\n\nthe  requirement that  a  defendant's cooperation  in identifying\r\n\naccomplices be sufficiently comprehensive to constitute \"substan-\r\n\ntial assistance\" as certified by a government motion recommending\r\n\na downward  departure.  Commentary  to U.S.S.G.    5K1.1 provides\r\n\nthat\r\n\n          [t]he sentencing reduction  for assistance to\r\n          authorities shall be considered independently\r                                                                 \r\n          of any reduction for acceptance of  responsi-\r\n          bility.

(n.2) (emphasis added).  \r\n\n          At  first blush  this commentary  may  seem to  support\r\n\nNu ez'  contention, but  it is far  from conclusive.   At most it\r\n\nindicates  simply that  the  sentencing  court  is  to  undertake\r\n\nsequential  inquiries under sections  3E1.1 and 5K1.1,  since the\r                    \r\n\ntwo independent  standards require the court to balance and weigh\r\n\ndifferent  criteria.   Unlike  section  5K1.1, moreover,  section\r\n\n3E1.1 requires  the sentencing  court to  balance many  divergent\r                                                                \r\n\nfactors, consistent and inconsistent with acceptance of responsi-\r\n\nbility.  Nothing in application note 2 to section 5K1.1 suggests,\r\n\nhowever, that these sequential inquiries may not involve overlap-\r\n\nping  criteria,  in  particular the  \"informer\"  criterion.

For example,  assistance in\r\n\nidentifying,  apprehending,  or   prosecuting  accomplices  might\r\n\nbuttress a  cooperating defendant's statements  of remorse  under\r\n\nsection 3E1.1, without regard to whether the government considers\r\n\nthe cooperation  sufficiently helpful  to warrant a  \"substantial\r\n\nassistance\" departure under section 5K1.1.\r\n\n          Finally, section  5K1.2 provides that  \"[a] defendant's\r\n\nrefusal  to  assist  authorities in  the  investigation  of other\r\n\npersons  may not  be  considered  as  an  aggravating  sentencing\r\n\nfactor.\"  The October 1988 version of U.S.S.G.   5K1.2 included a\r\n\nsingle commentary:  \"The Commission .  . . rejected the use of  a\r\n\ndefendant's  refusal to  assist  authorities  as  an  aggravating\r\n\nsentencing  factor.

First,  given its\r\n\nlocation in  the  guidelines section  dealing with  \"departures,\"\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nsection 5K1.2 clearly  forbids reliance on a  defendant's failure\r\n\nto identify accomplices as a basis  for an upward departure.

Significantly, the\r\n\n1988 version purported to allow the court to deny a section 3E1.1\r\n\nadjustment  where  the  defendant did  not  identify  accomplices\r\n\nbecause  his criminal  associations were  ongoing.   Further,  it\r\n\nseems  that the 1989  amendment deleted the  \"unclear\" commentary\r\n\nnot because the Commission had  altered its view on the propriety\r\n\nof the  section 3E1.1 practice  described in the  commentary, but\r\n\nbecause it concluded that the  current text in sections 3E1.1 and\r\n\n5K1.1 was sufficiently clear to  support such a sentencing  prac-\r\n\ntice     without further elaboration.  We therefore conclude that\r\n\nthe 1989 amendment was meant to clarify, not to effect a substan-\r\n\ntive change in sentencing policy.  See United States v.

In appropriate  circumstances a  sentencing court  is\r\n\npermitted  to consider, as  relevant evidence of  the defendant's\r\n\nsincerity  in accepting  responsibility for  his  own crimes,  at\r\n\nleast whether  a defendant truthfully has  identified accomplices\r\n\nin the  crimes  to which  the  defendant has  pled  guilty.   For\r\n\nexample,  where a defendant does not disclose accomplices because\r\n\nhe has  elected to continue  his criminal associations,  the sen-\r\n\ntencing  court may  consider  such conduct  along with  any other\r\n\nindicia of failure to accept  responsibility.  On the other hand,\r\n\nshould  the court determine  that a defendant  has not identified\r\n\nhis  accomplices because he genuinely fears retaliation, but that\r\n\nthe defendant's conduct otherwise demonstrates genuine remorse, a\r\n\ndownward adjustment under section 3E1.1 might yet be found appro-\r\n\npriate, as the  sentencing court's balancing and  weighing of the\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nrelevant criteria under section 3E1.1 is entitled to great defer-\r\n\nence on appeal.

(n.1(g)) (timeliness\r                           \r\n\nfactor), and  (ii) the inconsistent  stories given by  Nu ez, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.

See  supra Section II.A.1.  The court appropriately\r                                  \r\n\nquestioned  Nu ez' motives for  not disclosing the  identities of\r\n\nhis associates.  Its misgivings were prompted by Nu ez' inconsis-\r\n\ntent versions of the carjacking, and were explicitly connected to\r\n\nits finding that Nu ez, and  by extension, his insistence that he\r\n\nhad accepted responsibility, were not  credible.  Nu ez had given\r\n\nuncorroborated and inconsistent explanations  for not identifying\r\n\nhis  accomplices:  first,  he claimed that he  had not known them\r\n\nbefore the day of the  carjacking, and never learned their names;\r\n\nand, second, he was \"afraid\" to  identify them.

Thus,  the quoted\r\n\nstatement does not  cure the  inherent ambiguity  created by  the\r\n\ncategorical remarks the court made earlier.  Consequently, on the\r\n\nrecord as  a whole,  we cannot  say that  we are  left \"with  the\r\n\ndefinite  and firm conviction  that removal of  the inappropriate\r\n\nground would not be likely to alter the  district court's view of\r\n\nthe sentence  rightfully to be  imposed.\"  See  Diaz, 39 F.3d  at\r                                                              \r\n\n568.
