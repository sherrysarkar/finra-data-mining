Upon de novo review, we affirm the\n\nsummary   judgment      dismissing   plaintiff's   complaint\n\nsubstantially for the reasons stated in the district court's\n\norder of dismissal.     The district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying plaintiff's alternative request for\n\nleave to amend the complaint since the proposed amendment\n\nwas frivolous (and, in all events, would have been futile).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\f",
