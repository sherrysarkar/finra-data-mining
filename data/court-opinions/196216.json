Royal  Bank of  Canada (\"Royal\r                                       \r\n\nBank\") appeals from an order of the district court finding it\r\n\nin  civil  contempt for  violating  an  attachment order  and\r\n\nassessing damages  of $1.63 million plus  attorney's fees and\r\n\ncosts.  The district court found that Royal Bank had assisted\r\n\nin  frustrating the  application  of an  attachment order  to\r\n\nassets  that Royal Bank claimed  for its own.   Because Royal\r\n\nBank was not a party to the underlying execution proceedings,\r\n\nthe contempt order is  considered a final decision appealable\r\n\nby  Royal Bank  under 28 U.S.C.    1291.   Appeal  of Licht &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nSemonoff, 796 F.2d 564, 568 (1st Cir. 1986). \r                    \r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n     The  attachment  order  at  issue here  was  entered  on\r\n\nJanuary  13, 1987, to execute  a New York  judgment for Seiko\r\n\nTime Corporation (\"Seiko\")  against Gemco Latinoam rica, Inc.\r\n\n(\"Gemco\")  in  the amount  of  $3.16  million plus  interest.\r\n\nEarlier Gemco  had been  the exclusive distributor  for Seiko\r\n\nwatches  and clocks  in  Puerto Rico.    Initially Gemco  was\r\n\nwholly  owned and operated by Jos  and Carmen Pascual, as was\r\n\na related company, the Watch and Gem Palace, Inc. (\"Watch and\r\n\nGem\"); later Jos  Pascual  (\"Pascual\") became the sole owner.\r\n\nGemco served as a wholesale distributor for jewelry and  time\r\n\npieces,  while  Watch  and  Gem operated  two  retail  stores\r\n\nspecializing  in  jewelry  and  time pieces  (the  Plaza  Las\r\n\nAmericas store and the Old San Juan Store).   \r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     Beginning in 1981, Royal  Bank began extending credit to\r\n\nGemco secured  by a  factor's lien on  Gemco's inventory  and\r\n\naccounts receivable under Puerto Rico's Factor's Lien Act, 10\r\n\nL.P.R.A.    551 et seq.  Gemco thereafter transferred most of\r                                   \r\n\nthe funds  it borrowed  from Royal Bank  to Watch and  Gem in\r\n\norder  to finance  Watch and  Gem's retail  operations; these\r\n\ntransfers  were   recorded  in  Watch  and   Gem's  books  as\r\n\nintercompany  accounts  payable  and  in   Gemco's  books  as\r\n\nintercompany accounts  receivable.  By early  1986 Royal Bank\r\n\nhad extended credit to Gemco which exceeded $1.4 million, and\r\n\nGemco's books showed an account receivable due from Watch and\r\n\nGem of $2.15 million.\r\n\n     In  March 1986,  Royal  Bank sought  to restructure  and\r\n\nresecure  Gemco's debt, as well  as a much  smaller debt then\r\n\nowed to the bank  by Watch and Gem.  To  this end, Royal Bank\r\n\nobtained new  factor's liens  from both  Gemco and Watch  and\r\n\nGem,  assignments of  Gemco's  and Watch  and Gem's  accounts\r\n\nreceivable including all  \"intercompany receivables,\"  cross-\r\n\nguaranties from Gemco,  Watch and Gem  and the Pascuals,  and\r\n\nmortgages on various  properties owned by the Pascuals.   The\r\n\namount   owing  to  the  bank  from  Gemco  at  the  time  of\r\n\nrestructuring was $1.25 million, while Watch and Gem owed the\r\n\nbank just $125,000. \r\n\n     In  October   1986,  Seiko  obtained   a  $2.85  million\r\n\narbitration award  against Gemco  in New York,  stemming from\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nGemco's failure to pay  for goods that Seiko had  provided to\r\n\nGemco.  The award was  confirmed by the district of  New York\r\n\non  November 4, 1986, and  judgment was entered  for Seiko on\r\n\nNovember 12, 1986, for $3,167,946.49.  The New York  judgment\r\n\nwas  registered  in the  district  court  in Puerto  Rico  on\r\n\nDecember 16, 1986, and on January 13, 1987, that court issued\r\n\nan  attachment order  and accompanying  writ of  execution to\r\n\nsatisfy Seiko's  $3.16 million  judgment against Gemco.   The\r\n\norder attached the following assets of Gemco:\r\n\n     1) All  debts and accounts  receivable belonging to\r\n     Gemco, including those owing from The Watch and Gem\r\n     Palace, Inc. and Timekeepers, Inc.\r\n\n     2)  The bank accounts in  the name of  Gemco in the\r\n     Royal Bank of Canada (Current Account  No. 132-420-\r\n     1) and  the Plaza Scotia Bank  (Current Account No.\r\n     006-1919-14).\r\n\n     3)  Merchandise  inventory   consisting  of   Seiko\r\n     watches  and clocks  and  Colirbr  brand  lighters,\r\n     located  at the fourth floor of the building at 204\r\n     San Jos  Street, Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.\r\n\n     4)  An  IBM  System  36  Computer  with  peripheral\r\n     equipment  located  at  the  second  floor  of  the\r\n     building at 204 San Jos  Street, Old San Juan.\r\n\n     The  order also  instructed Gemco's  various  debtors to\r\n\nremit any amounts owed to Gemco into court:\r\n\n     The Marshal shall also  be instructed to notify the\r\n     present order  to The  Watch and Gem  Palace, Inc.;\r\n     Timekeepers, Inc.; The  Royal Bank  of Canada,  and\r\n     the Plaza  Scotiabank, and to instruct said parties\r\n     to  refrain, upon penalty  of contempt, from making\r\n     any other  payments to  Gemco by concept  of monies\r\n     owed  from  any  of  the  attached  debts, accounts\r\n     receivable  or bank  accounts.   The Marshal  shall\r\n     collect  any amounts  belonging to  Gemco presently\r\n     deposited  in   any  of  the   aforementioned  bank\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     accounts.  Any other  amounts owed to Gemco  by any\r\n     of  the aforementioned  under any  of  the attached\r\n     debts,  accounts receivable or  bank accounts shall\r\n     be  henceforth remitted to this  Court . . ., where\r\n     in due  course, it shall  be claimed by  Seiko Time\r\n     Corporation.\r\n\n     At the  time of execution, Gemco's primary asset was the\r\n\naccount  receivable arising  from  the  various  intercompany\r\n\nloans  it had  made  to Watch  and  Gem over  the years;  the\r\n\naccount then stood at around $2 million.  Also at the time of\r\n\nexecution, Gemco still owed  Royal Bank around $1.05 million,\r\n\nwhile Watch and Gem owed the bank nothing.      \r\n\n     Royal  Bank was  served  with a  copy  of the  order  of\r\n\nattachment on January 20,  1987.  The very next day  the bank\r\n\nobtained from  Pascual an assignment of  any proceeds derived\r\n\nfrom the  contemplated sale  of Watch  and  Gem's Plazas  Las\r\n\nAmericas store, purportedly as further security for Watch and\r\n\nGem's guaranty of Gemco's debt.  On April 27, 1987, Watch and\r\n\nGem  sold its  Plazas Las  Americas store  for $850,000.   By\r\n\nagreement, the purchase price was disbursed directly to Royal\r\n\nBank--minus back rent due Watch and Gem's landlord.\r\n\n     Of the  $850,000  purchase price,  Royal  Bank  received\r\n\n$797,219.73,  which  was   fully  credited  against   Gemco's\r\n\nindebtedness, ostensibly  under Watch  and  Gem's March  1986\r\n\nguaranty.  This reduced  Gemco's total debt to Royal  Bank to\r\n\n$300,357.71 as of June 30, 1987.  On that day,  Watch and Gem\r\n\nthen  assumed the balance of Gemco's indebtedness by taking a\r\n\n$300,357.71 loan from  Royal Bank.  According  to Royal Bank,\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nthis  loan   simply  erased  Gemco's  debt   and  created  an\r\n\nequivalent  debt in Watch and Gem's name; Watch and Gem never\r\n\nreceived any money. \r\n\n     At the same  time, Royal  Bank also extended  a line  of\r\n\ncredit  to Watch  and  Gem for  \"working  capital\".   Through\r\n\nDecember 1987,  Watch and Gem  borrowed a  total of  $200,000\r\n\nfrom the bank.  Watch and Gem used the proceeds from this new\r\n\nloan  to pay off Gemco's creditors other than Seiko, in order\r\n\nto  maintain  Gemco  as a  viable  entity  so  that it  could\r\n\ncontinue a New  York lawsuit that  Gemco had brought  against\r\n\nSeiko.1  During this  time, Royal Bank also made  some direct\r\n\npayments to Watch and Gem's creditor.  At no  point did Watch\r\n\nand Gem pay  into court  the amount originally  owing on  the\r\n\nintercompany debt.\r\n\n     Seiko eventually learned of  Watch and Gem's payments to\r\n\nGemco's other  creditors and Watch and  Gem's satisfaction of\r\n\nGemco's debt to  Royal Bank.  On  July 10, 1987, Seiko  moved\r\n\nfor  a finding of contempt  against Gemco, Watch  and Gem and\r\n\nthe  Pascuals.   After  a hearing,  the Puerto  Rico district\r\n\ncourt on January 21, 1988, held Gemco, Watch  and Gem and the\r\n\nPascuals in  contempt for violating the  attachment order and\r\n\ndiverting Gemco assets away  from Seiko.  On March  18, 1988,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1This litigation  by Gemco was  ultimately unsuccessful.\r\nSee  Gemco Latinoamerica,  Inc. v.  Seiko  Time Corp.  671 F.\r                                                                 \r\nSupp. 972 (S.D.N.Y. 1987), 685 F. Supp. 400 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nSeiko  filed  a motion  for contempt  against Royal  Bank and\r\n\nrequest for damages.\r\n\n     Shortly thereafter, on March 22, 1988, Pascual moved for\r\n\ncourt permission  to sell the inventory from  Watch and Gem's\r\n\nOld San  Juan store  in order \"to  apply the proceeds  to the\r\n\nindebtedness [Watch  and  Gem]  owes  to the  Royal  Bank  of\r\n\nCanada.\"  In  late June,  before any sale  took place,  Royal\r\n\nBank  seized  the  inventory  of  the  Old San  Juan  store--\r\n\npurportedly acting under an order issued by a local court--to\r\n\nprotect its collateral for the loans it had extended to Watch\r\n\nand Gem starting in June 1987.  Royal Bank's seizure occurred\r\n\nshortly before its  show cause hearing in  the district court\r\n\non the contempt charge, which took place on July 15, 1988. \r\n\n     On January  27, 1994, the  district court issued  an 18-\r\n\npage order finding Royal  Bank in contempt.  The  court found\r\n\nthat  Royal Bank  had aided  and abetted  a violation  of the\r\n\nJanuary 13, 1987, attachment order by utilizing Watch and Gem\r\n\nfunds  to repay  Gemco's debts  instead of paying  that money\r\n\ninto court.  The district court then assessed damages against\r\n\nRoyal Bank,  reasoning that  if not improperly  diverted, the\r\n\nfunds  would  have  eventually  gone to  Seiko.    The  court\r\n\ncalculated damages to be  $1.63 million (plus attorney's fees\r\n\nand costs later fixed at $64,954.25) as follows: \r\n\n     1.   $797,219.73 from  the sale of  Watch and Gem's\r\n     Plazas Las  Americas store,  the proceeds  of which\r\n     were paid directly to Royal Bank;\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\n     2.   $52,780.27  that  Royal Bank  directed  to the\r\n     landlord for  Watch and  Gem's Plazas Las  Americas\r\n     store; \r\n\n     3.   $250,000  that  had  constituted a  \"loan\"  to\r\n     Watch and Gem from Royal Bank, which  Watch and Gem\r\n     had used to  pay Gemco's third-party  creditors and\r\n     which Royal  Bank had used  to pay Watch  and Gem's\r\n     creditors directly;\r\n\n     4.   $530,000   from   Royal   Bank's  seizure   of\r\n     inventory from Watch and  Gem's Old San Juan store,\r\n     which blocked the  sale of the  store to a  willing\r\n     buyer for the purchase price of that amount.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n     In  reviewing  a  district  court's  contempt  order, we\r\n\naccept the district  court's factual findings  and reasonable\r\n\ninferences if  not clearly erroneous.

By its  terms the January 13,  1987, order attached\r\n\n\"[a]ll debts and accounts receivable belonging to Gemco . . .\r\n\nowing  from [Watch  and  Gem]\" and  directed that  apart from\r\n\nGemco  bank  accounts (which  the  marshal  was to  collect),\r\n\n\"[a]ny other amounts owed to  Gemco by [Watch and Gem] .  . .\r\n\nshall be  henceforth remitted  to this Court   .  . . .\"   We\r\n\nthink that a reasonably straightforward reading of this order\r\n\nrequired Watch and Gem to pay  over to the district court the\r\n\namount that Watch and Gem then owed to Gemco,  which was well\r\n\nover $1 million.\r\n\n     Instead,  there   followed  a  series  of   payments  to\r\n\nrecipients other than the  court--primarily by Watch and Gem,\r\n\nor out of  its assets--to the advantage  of Royal Bank.   The\r\n\nfirst and  largest  of these  payments was  the diversion  of\r\n\nproceeds from the sale of Watch and Gem's Plazas Las Americas\r\n\nstore; the bank received $797,219.73, which it used to reduce\r\n\nGemco's outstanding debt to  the bank, and by pre-arrangement\r\n\nover  $50,000 went  to  Gemco's landlord.   This  transaction\r\n\noccurred in April 1987, well after the bank had been notified\r\n\nof the attachment order.\r\n\n     Although the bank has  filed a 45-page brief, it  is not\r\n\neasy to  discern from  that document  precisely why the  bank\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\nthinks  that  these   payments  were   consistent  with   the\r\n\n\"henceforth remitted\"  directive in  the court's order.   The\r\n\nbrief explains why the bank cannot be deemed to have violated\r\n\nother provisions  of the  order  but it  largely ignores  the\r                 \r\n\nprovision  directing Watch  and Gem  to pay  what it  owed to\r\n\nGemco  directly to  the  court, a  provision stressed  in the\r\n\ndistrict  court's contempt  order.   Queen Victoria's  famous\r\n\nphrase, \"We are not amused,\" is remarkably apt.\r\n\n     The  bank does argue that Watch and Gem's payment to the\r\n\nbank  was  made to  discharge Watch  and Gem's  own allegedly\r\n\nlegitimate  guaranty of Gemco's obligations to the bank.  But\r\n\npaying  the  bank instead  of the  court,  when there  is not\r\n\nenough money  for both, still violates  the attachment order.\r\n\nThe  bank says that the attachment order did not forbid Watch\r\n\nand Gem from paying its own debts, but an $800,000 payment of\r\n\nanother  debt patently  frustrated  the clear  intent of  the\r\n\norder that Watch  and Gem's  money be  held for  Seiko.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nGeneral Motors Acceptance Corp.  v. Superior Court, 85 P.R.R.\r                                                              \r\n\n314, 319  (1962) (\"[garnished] funds are  symbolically in the\r\n\ncustody of the law\").\r\n\n     Similarly, we reject the bank's contention, offered as a\r\n\ndefense to the  charge of contempt,  that its claims  against\r\n\nWatch and Gem  assets had  priority.  As  the district  court\r\n\ncorrectly explained:\r\n\n     Watch &amp; Gem was  ordered to remit to the  Court the\r\n     amount  owed  GEMCO, for  the  ultimate  benefit of\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n     SEIKO TIME.   The court did  not limit or  restrict\r\n     its  Order to the payment of  funds which were free\r\n     of  third-party claims;  rather, the  Court ordered\r\n     that  such funds were to be paid into Court so that\r\n     the  Court  could  then  resolve  any  question  of\r\n     priorities.\r\n\nIf Watch and Gem's assets were subject to claims prior to the\r\n\nattachment order, the proper course was to pay the money into\r\n\ncourt and then litigate  the matter or, possibly, to  ask the\r\n\ndistrict court  to modify  its attachment.   See  32 L.P.R.A.\r                                                            \r\n\nApp.  III, R.  21.5  (right  to  intervene of  third  parties\r\n\nclaiming property  attached by order  of the court);  R. 21.6\r\n\n(motion to release property).  But self-help, in the teeth of\r\n\nthe court's  order,  was  not permissible.    See  Matter  of\r                                                                         \r\n\nProvidence Journal Co., 820 F.2d 1342, 1346  (1st Cir. 1986),\r                                  \r\n\ncert. dismissed, 485 U.S. 693 (1988).\r                           \r\n\n     Lastly, the bank says that, even if the attachment order\r\n\nwere violated,  the bank did not aid or abet the wrong.  Here\r\n\nthe bank not  only fostered but appears  to have orchestrated\r\n\nthe violations.  The  district court found that the  bank had\r\n\nworked \"hand in glove\" with Pascual, Gemco and Watch and Gem,\r\n\n\"controll[ed] all flow of monies to and from  those parties,\"\r\n\nand \"determin[ed] the corporate strategy of those parties\" in\r\n\norder  \"to avoid the scrutiny of the courts and maximize [the\r\n\nbank's] collections on its  loans to [Gemco].\"  Royal  Bank's\r\n\nbrief  in this  court makes  no serious  effort to  show that\r\n\nthese finding were clearly erroneous.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\n     2.   The district court ruled that Seiko was damaged not\r\n\nonly by the diversion of proceeds to the bank from the Plazas\r\n\nLas  Americas sale but also by the diversion of about $50,000\r\n\nfrom the same sale to Watch and Gem's landlord; by  the later\r\n\ndisbursements of about $250,000 to  other Gemco and Watch and\r\n\nGem  creditors; and  still  later by  the  bank's seizure  of\r\n\ninventory from the  Old San Juan store, frustrating a planned\r\n\nsale  of  that store  to a  third  party for  about $530,000.\r\n\nImplicit  in this damage calculation is the view that each of\r\n\nthese payments (or, in the last case, frustration of payment)\r\n\nwas also a violation of the court's attachment order.\r\n\n     This  is easy enough a conclusion as to the $52,000 paid\r\n\nto  the landlord.   This  payment was  part of  a prearranged\r\n\nallocation  of the proceeds of the sale; the bank, which took\r\n\nthe  lion's share  for  itself, was  clearly involved  in the\r\n\nallocation, and  the allocation  of the $52,000  violated the\r\n\ncourt's  \"henceforth remitted\" directive  for reasons already\r\n\ndiscussed in  connection with  the $797,000 payment.   Having\r\n\nhelped arrange these diversions,  the bank is responsible for\r\n\nthe full effect.\r\n\n     It  less clear that the same view should be taken of the\r\n\n$250,000 in  payments to  third-party creditors of  Gemco and\r\n\nWatch and Gem  or the  $530,000 loss that  occurred when  the\r\n\nbank frustrated  the sale  of the  Old San Juan  store.   The\r\n\nformer  were  apparently included  on  the  theory that  they\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nrepresented funds belonging to  Watch and Gem that,  like the\r\n\n$850,000 in proceeds from the original sale, were diverted to\r\n\ncreditors  of Gemco and Watch  and Gem instead  of being paid\r\n\ninto court.  The $250,000 was a loan by the bank to Watch and\r\n\nGem which, by  prearrangement with the bank,  was designed to\r\n\npay  off various  Gemco creditors  other than  Seiko, thereby\r\n\nforestalling an involuntary bankruptcy petition.\r\n\n     If  the $250,000 is  treated as  Watch and  Gem's money,\r\n\nthen the analysis is the same as with the $850,000.  The bank\r\n\nmight have argued that the $250,000 actually represented bank\r\n\nmoney to which Watch and  Gem had no claim and that  there is\r\n\nsomething odd about  treating the bank's own  decision to pay\r\n\noff Gemco creditors  with the bank's  own funds as  depriving\r\n\nSeiko  of Watch and Gem assets.  Still, having structured the\r\n\ntransaction as  a loan to  Watch and Gem--presumably  to give\r\n\nthe  bank a claim for repayment--the bank may have thought it\r\n\ndangerous to describe  the loan as a  sham.  Anyway, it  does\r\n\nnot try to distinguish the $250,000 payment.\r\n\n     As for the $530,000  loss, this was charged to  the bank\r\n\nbecause it frustrated the sale  of the Old San Juan store  by\r\n\nseizing  Watch  and  Gem assets,  effectively  violating  the\r\n\nattachment order.   Although  it  appears that  the bank  did\r\n\ncause the loss, it  might have argued that the  proposed sale\r\n\nwas its own creation  (it had proposed to finance  the third-\r\n\nparty buyer)  and that, without its  cooperation, there would\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nhave  been no sale even without its seizure of the inventory.\r\n\nBut  again  the bank  makes  no  such  argument, and  instead\r\n\nimplies (quite  incorrectly) that the  local court's  alleged\r\n\napproval  of  the   seizure  trumped  the   district  court's\r\n\nattachment order.\r\n\n     In all events, the bank has chosen to fight on a broader\r\n\nfront--primarily by denying that anyone's action violated the\r\n\nattachment  order  or  that  it aided  and  abetted  any such\r\n\nviolation.   Absent  extraordinary circumstances,  we confine\r\n\nourselves  in  civil  cases  to  the arguments  made  by  the\r\n\nparties.   FDIC v.  Fedders Air Conditioning,  USA, Inc.,  35\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 18, 21  (1st Cir. 1994).  Whether or  not the bank might\r\n\nhave distinguished among the damage items and sought to limit\r\n\nits exposure, it has not done so here.\r\n\n     3.    Even  though  Royal Bank's  conduct  violated  the\r\n\nattachment order and diverted or blocked the funds that would\r\n\notherwise  have been paid into court, Royal Bank is liable in\r\n\na civil contempt proceeding  only for actual damages.   In re\r                                                                         \r\n\nPower Recovery Systems,  Inc., 950  F.2d 798,  802 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1991).   In this instance, the bank could arguably defeat the\r\n\ndamage  award--although  not   the  finding  of  contempt--by\r\n\nshowing that the money paid into court would ultimately  have\r\n\nbeen awarded to the bank rather than Seiko.\r\n\n     Neither  in the district court nor in this court has the\r\n\nbank ever  made this  argument in a  straightforward fashion.\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                         -15-\r\r\n\nAlthough there are a number of  references to its priorities,\r\n\nthese  occur in the course  of its various  arguments that no\r\n\ncontempt occurred.  Perhaps as a result, the district court's\r\n\nbrief discussion  of priority issues is also  directed not to\r\n\ndamages  but to  contempt.   For this  purpose, the  district\r\n\ncourt's  discussion  is  strictly speaking  unnecessary,  for\r\n\nreasons already given both by it and by us.\r\n\n     An appellant waives arguments not made or only cursorily\r\n\ndeveloped, e.g., Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n26, 36 (1st Cir. 1994), and in this instance the  bank can be\r\n\nreproached  on both grounds:   it makes  no argument assuming\r                                                       \r\n\ncontempt arguendo but challenging the computation of damages;\r                             \r\n\nand  to  the extent  it  discusses the  priority  issues, the\r\n\ndiscussion is episodic, incomplete  and (in certain respects)\r\n\nquite unpersuasive.\r\n\n     Nevertheless, there are scattered fragments out of which\r\n\none might well  try to build  a case  that the 1981  factor's\r\n\nlien  or the  1986  liens and  assignments  gave the  bank  a\r\n\npriority as to amounts owing to Gemco.  The law in this area-\r\n\n-both as to  the Puerto  Rico factor's lien  statute and  the\r\n\nassignment  of accounts  receivable statute--is  at the  same\r\n\ntime both sparse  (in explanatory case  law) and complex  (in\r\n\nstatutory  language).    See  10  L.P.R.A.      551  et  seq.\r                                                                         \r\n\n(Factor's  Lien Act); 10 L.P.R.A.     581 et seq. (Assignment\r                                                             \r\n\nof Accounts  Receivable Act).   The security  transactions in\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n\nthis case are multiple,  interrelated and in certain respects\r\n\npeculiar.\r\n\n     We  have now  spent an  undue amount  of time  seeking a\r\n\nclear  path  through  this  morass  in  a  futile  effort  to\r\n\ndetermine whether or not  the bank possessed valid priorities\r\n\nthat could be  used to  reduce or even  eliminate the  damage\r\n\nclaims   against  it.    Although   we  spare  the  reader  a\r\n\ndescription  of  false starts  and  dead  ends and  remaining\r\n\nperplexities,  the conclusion is clear:   there is  no way to\r\n\nanswer  the central  question, short  of a  remand, extensive\r\n\nfurther briefing and probably further fact-finding.\r\n\n     Given  the   bank's  effective  waiver  of  the  damages\r\n\nargument, no such remand can be justified.  We cannot require\r\n\nthe district court  or Seiko to engage  in further litigation\r\n\nbased  on  a  mere suspicion  that  the  bank  might have  an\r                                                                \r\n\nargument  for curtailing damages.  It is ironic that, had the\r\n\nbank permitted the  funds to  be paid into  court instead  of\r\n\ndiverting them  to its own uses, the ensuing litigation would\r\n\nlikely have focused  on its priority  rights rather than  its\r\n\ncontempt.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -17-\r                                         -17-\r\r\n",

The district court found that Royal Bank had assisted in frustrating the application of an attachment order to assets that Royal Bank claimed for its own.  Because Royal Bank was not a party to the underlying execution proceedings, the contempt order is considered a final decision appealable by Royal Bank under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291.

(\"Gemco\") in the amount of $3.16 million plus interest.  Earlier Gemco had been the exclusive distributor for Seiko watches and clocks in Puerto Rico.  Initially Gemco was wholly owned and operated by Jose and Carmen Pascual, as was a related company, the Watch and Gem Palace, Inc.  (\"Watch and Gem\");  later Jose Pascual (\"Pascual\") became the sole owner.  Gemco served as a wholesale distributor for jewelry and time pieces, while Watch and Gem operated two retail stores specializing in jewelry and time pieces (the Plaza Las Americas store and the Old San Juan Store).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1981, Royal Bank began extending credit to Gemco secured by a factor's lien on Gemco's inventory and accounts receivable under Puerto Rico's Factor's Lien Act, 10 L.P.R.A. Secs. 551 et seq.   Gemco thereafter transferred most of the funds it borrowed from Royal Bank to Watch and Gem in order to finance Watch and Gem's retail operations;  these transfers were recorded in Watch and Gem's books as intercompany accounts payable and in Gemco's books as intercompany accounts receivable.  By early 1986 Royal Bank had extended credit to Gemco which exceeded $1.4 million, and Gemco's books showed an account receivable due from Watch and Gem of $2.15 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1986, Royal Bank sought to restructure and resecure Gemco's debt, as well as a much smaller debt then owed to the bank by Watch and Gem.  To this end, Royal Bank obtained new factor's liens from both Gemco and Watch and Gem, assignments of Gemco's and Watch and Gem's accounts receivable including all \"intercompany receivables,\" cross-guaranties from Gemco, Watch and Gem and the Pascuals, and mortgages on various properties owned by the Pascuals.  The amount owing to the bank from Gemco at the time of restructuring was $1.25 million, while Watch and Gem owed the bank just $125,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1986, Seiko obtained a $2.85 million arbitration award against Gemco in New York, stemming from Gemco's failure to pay for goods that Seiko had provided to Gemco.  The award was confirmed by the district of New York on November 4, 1986, and judgment was entered for Seiko on November 12, 1986, for $3,167,946.49.  The New York judgment was registered in the district court in Puerto Rico on December 16, 1986, and on January 13, 1987, that court issued an attachment order and accompanying writ of execution to satisfy Seiko's $3.16 million judgment against Gemco.  The order attached the following assets of Gemco:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>1) All debts and accounts receivable belonging to Gemco, including those owing from The Watch and Gem Palace, Inc. and Timekeepers, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>2) The bank accounts in the name of Gemco in the Royal Bank of Canada (Current Account No. 132-420-1) and the Plaza Scotia Bank (Current Account No. 006-1919-14).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>3) Merchandise inventory consisting of Seiko watches and clocks and Colirbri brand lighters, located at the fourth floor of the building at 204 San Jose Street, Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>4) An IBM System 36 Computer with peripheral equipment located at the second floor of the building at 204 San Jose, Street, Old San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order also instructed Gemco's various debtors to remit any amounts owed to Gemco into court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>The Marshal shall also be instructed to notify the present order to The Watch and Gem Palace, Inc.;   Timekeepers, Inc.;   The Royal Bank of Canada, and the Plaza Scotiabank, and to instruct said parties to refrain, upon penalty of contempt, from making any other payments to Gemco by concept of monies owed from any of the attached debts, accounts receivable or bank accounts.  The Marshal shall collect any amounts belonging to Gemco presently deposited in any of the aforementioned bank accounts.  Any other amounts owed to Gemco by any of the aforementioned under any of the attached debts, accounts receivable or bank accounts shall be henceforth remitted to this Court ..., where in due course, it shall be claimed by Seiko Time Corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of execution, Gemco's primary asset was the account receivable arising from the various intercompany loans it had made to Watch and Gem over the years;  the account then stood at around $2 million.  Also at the time of execution, Gemco still owed Royal Bank around $1.05 million, while Watch and Gem owed the bank nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal Bank was served with a copy of the order of attachment on January 20, 1987.  The very next day the bank obtained from Pascual an assignment of any proceeds derived from the contemplated sale of Watch and Gem's Plazas Las Americas store, purportedly as further security for Watch and Gem's guaranty of Gemco's debt.  On April 27, 1987, Watch and Gem sold its Plazas Las Americas store for $850,000.  By agreement, the purchase price was disbursed directly to Royal Bank--minus back rent due Watch and Gem's landlord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the $850,000 purchase price, Royal Bank received $797,219.73, which was fully credited against Gemco's indebtedness, ostensibly under Watch and Gem's March 1986 guaranty.  This reduced Gemco's total debt to Royal Bank to $300,357.71 as of June 30, 1987.  On that day, Watch and Gem then assumed the balance of Gemco's indebtedness by taking a $300,357.71 loan from Royal Bank.  According to Royal Bank, this loan simply erased Gemco's debt and created an equivalent debt in Watch and Gem's name;  Watch and Gem never received any money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, Royal Bank also extended a line of credit to Watch and Gem for \"working capital\".  Through December 1987, Watch and Gem borrowed a total of $200,000 from the bank.  Watch and Gem used the proceeds from this new loan to pay off Gemco's creditors other than Seiko, in order to maintain Gemco as a viable entity so that it could continue a New York lawsuit that Gemco had brought against Seiko.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  During this time, Royal Bank also made some direct payments to Watch and Gem's creditor.  At no point did Watch and Gem pay into court the amount originally owing on the intercompany debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seiko eventually learned of Watch and Gem's payments to Gemco's other creditors and Watch and Gem's satisfaction of Gemco's debt to Royal Bank.  On July 10, 1987, Seiko moved for a finding of contempt against Gemco, Watch and Gem and the Pascuals.  After a hearing, the Puerto Rico district court on January 21, 1988, held Gemco, Watch and Gem and the Pascuals in contempt for violating the attachment order and diverting Gemco assets away from Seiko.  On March 18, 1988, Seiko filed a motion for contempt against Royal Bank and request for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, on March 22, 1988, Pascual moved for court permission to sell the inventory from Watch and Gem's Old San Juan store in order \"to apply the proceeds to the indebtedness [Watch and Gem] owes to the Royal Bank of Canada.\"   In late June, before any sale took place, Royal Bank seized the inventory of the Old San Juan store--purportedly acting under an order issued by a local court--to protect its collateral for the loans it had extended to Watch and Gem starting in June 1987.  Royal Bank's seizure occurred shortly before its show cause hearing in the district court on the contempt charge, which took place on July 15, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 27, 1994, the district court issued an 18-page order finding Royal Bank in contempt.  The court found that Royal Bank had aided and abetted a violation of the January 13, 1987, attachment order by utilizing Watch and Gem funds to repay Gemco's debts instead of paying that money into court.  The district court then assessed damages against Royal Bank, reasoning that if not improperly diverted, the funds would have eventually gone to Seiko.  The court calculated damages to be $1.63 million (plus attorney's fees and costs later fixed at $64,954.25) as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>1. $797,219.73 from the sale of Watch and Gem's Plazas Las Americas store, the proceeds of which were paid directly to Royal Bank;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>2. $52,780.27 that Royal Bank directed to the landlord for Watch and Gem's Plazas Las Americas store;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>3. $250,000 that had constituted a \"loan\" to Watch and Gem from Royal Bank, which Watch and Gem had used to pay Gemco's third-party creditors and which Royal Bank had used to pay Watch and Gem's creditors directly;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>4. $530,000 from Royal Bank's seizure of inventory from Watch and Gem's Old San Juan store, which blocked the sale of the store to a willing buyer for the purchase price of that amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a district court's contempt order, we accept the district court's factual findings and reasonable inferences if not clearly erroneous.  Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 947 F.2d 11, 15-16 (1st Cir.1991).  A civil contempt must be established by clear and convincing evidence and the underlying order must be clear and unambiguous in its terms.  Id. at 16.   A nonparty, although not directly bound by the order, may be held in civil contempt if it knowingly aids or abets a party in violating the court order.  G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. v. Webster Dictionary Co., Inc., 639 F.2d 29, 34-35 (1st Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Royal Bank argues that the payments from Watch and Gem to Royal Bank did not violate the specific terms of the order, and even if they did, Royal Bank says that it did not aid or abet the violation.  Alternatively, Royal Bank argues that it had a superior claim to seize the Gemco and Watch and Gem assets in question despite Seiko's attachment.  We will address each of these issues, and one other, in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. By its terms the January 13, 1987, order attached \"[a]ll debts and accounts receivable belonging to Gemco ... owing from [Watch and Gem]\" and directed that apart from Gemco bank accounts (which the marshal was to collect), \"[a]ny other amounts owed to Gemco by [Watch and Gem] ... shall be henceforth remitted to this Court....\"  We think that a reasonably straightforward reading of this order required Watch and Gem to pay over to the district court the amount that Watch and Gem then owed to Gemco, which was well over $1 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, there followed a series of payments to recipients other than the court--primarily by Watch and Gem, or out of its assets--to the advantage of Royal Bank.  The first and largest of these payments was the diversion of proceeds from the sale of Watch and Gem's Plazas Las Americas store;  the bank received $797,219.73, which it used to reduce Gemco's outstanding debt to the bank, and by pre-arrangement over $50,000 went to Gemco's landlord.  This transaction occurred in April 1987, well after the bank had been notified of the attachment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the bank has filed a 45-page brief, it is not easy to discern from that document precisely why the bank thinks that these payments were consistent with the \"henceforth remitted\" directive in the court's order.  The brief explains why the bank cannot be deemed to have violated other provisions of the order but it largely ignores the provision directing Watch and Gem to pay what it owed to Gemco directly to the court, a provision stressed in the district court's contempt order.  Queen Victoria's famous phrase, \"We are not amused,\" is remarkably apt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bank does argue that Watch and Gem's payment to the bank was made to discharge Watch and Gem's own allegedly legitimate guaranty of Gemco's obligations to the bank.  But paying the bank instead of the court, when there is not enough money for both, still violates the attachment order.  The bank says that the attachment order did not forbid Watch and Gem from paying its own debts, but an $800,000 payment of another debt patently frustrated the clear intent of the order that Watch and Gem's money be held for Seiko.  Cf. General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Superior Court, 85 P.R.R. 314, 319 (1962) (\"[garnished] funds are symbolically in the custody of the law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we reject the bank's contention, offered as a defense to the charge of contempt, that its claims against Watch and Gem assets had priority.  As the district court correctly explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Watch &amp; Gem was ordered to remit to the Court the amount owed GEMCO, for the ultimate benefit of SEIKO TIME.  The court did not limit or restrict its Order to the payment of funds which were free of third-party claims;  rather, the Court ordered that such funds were to be paid into Court so that the Court could then resolve any question of priorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Watch and Gem's assets were subject to claims prior to the attachment order, the proper course was to pay the money into court and then litigate the matter or, possibly, to ask the district court to modify its attachment.  See 32 L.P.R.A.App. III, R. 21.5 (right to intervene of third parties claiming property attached by order of the court);  R. 21.6 (motion to release property).  But self-help, in the teeth of the court's order, was not permissible.  See Matter of Providence Journal Co., 820 F.2d 1342, 1346 (1st Cir.1986), cert. dismissed, 485 U.S. 693, 108 S.Ct. 1502, 99 L.Ed.2d 785 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the bank says that, even if the attachment order were violated, the bank did not aid or abet the wrong.  Here the bank not only fostered but appears to have orchestrated the violations.  The district court found that the bank had worked \"hand in glove\" with Pascual, Gemco and Watch and Gem, \"controll[ed] all flow of monies to and from those parties,\" and \"determin[ed] the corporate strategy of those parties\" in order \"to avoid the scrutiny of the courts and maximize [the bank's] collections on its loans to [Gemco].\"  Royal Bank's brief in this court makes no serious effort to show that these finding were clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The district court ruled that Seiko was damaged not only by the diversion of proceeds to the bank from the Plazas Las Americas sale but also by the diversion of about $50,000 from the same sale to Watch and Gem's landlord;  by the later disbursements of about $250,000 to other Gemco and Watch and Gem creditors;  and still later by the bank's seizure of inventory from the Old San Juan store, frustrating a planned sale of that store to a third party for about $530,000.  Implicit in this damage calculation is the view that each of these payments (or, in the last case, frustration of payment) was also a violation of the court's attachment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is easy enough a conclusion as to the $52,000 paid to the landlord.  This payment was part of a prearranged allocation of the proceeds of the sale;  the bank, which took the lion's share for itself, was clearly involved in the allocation, and the allocation of the $52,000 violated the court's \"henceforth remitted\" directive for reasons already discussed in connection with the $797,000 payment.  Having helped arrange these diversions, the bank is responsible for the full effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It less clear that the same view should be taken of the $250,000 in payments to third-party creditors of Gemco and Watch and Gem or the $530,000 loss that occurred when the bank frustrated the sale of the Old San Juan store.  The former were apparently included on the theory that they represented funds belonging to Watch and Gem that, like the $850,000 in proceeds from the original sale, were diverted to creditors of Gemco and Watch and Gem instead of being paid into court.  The $250,000 was a loan by the bank to Watch and Gem which, by prearrangement with the bank, was designed to pay off various Gemco creditors other than Seiko, thereby forestalling an involuntary bankruptcy petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the $250,000 is treated as Watch and Gem's money, then the analysis is the same as with the $850,000.  The bank might have argued that the $250,000 actually represented bank money to which Watch and Gem had no claim and that there is something odd about treating the bank's own decision to pay off Gemco creditors with the bank's own funds as depriving Seiko of Watch and Gem assets.  Still, having structured the transaction as a loan to Watch and Gem--presumably to give the bank a claim for repayment--the bank may have thought it dangerous to describe the loan as a sham.  Anyway, it does not try to distinguish the $250,000 payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the $530,000 loss, this was charged to the bank because it frustrated the sale of the Old San Juan store by seizing Watch and Gem assets, effectively violating the attachment order.  Although it appears that the bank did cause the loss, it might have argued that the proposed sale was its own creation (it had proposed to finance the third-party buyer) and that, without its cooperation, there would have been no sale even without its seizure of the inventory.  But again the bank makes no such argument, and instead implies (quite incorrectly) that the local court's alleged approval of the seizure trumped the district court's attachment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the bank has chosen to fight on a broader front--primarily by denying that anyone's action violated the attachment order or that it aided and abetted any such violation.  Absent extraordinary circumstances, we confine ourselves in civil cases to the arguments made by the parties.  FDIC v. Fedders Air Conditioning, USA, Inc., 35 F.3d 18, 21 (1st Cir.1994).  Whether or not the bank might have distinguished among the damage items and sought to limit its exposure, it has not done so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  Even though Royal Bank's conduct violated the attachment order and diverted or blocked the funds that would otherwise have been paid into court, Royal Bank is liable in a civil contempt proceeding only for actual damages.  In re Power Recovery Systems, Inc., 950 F.2d 798, 802 (1st Cir.1991).  In this instance, the bank could arguably defeat the damage award--although not the finding of contempt--by showing that the money paid into court would ultimately have been awarded to the bank rather than Seiko.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither in the district court nor in this court has the bank ever made this argument in a straightforward fashion.  Although there are a number of references to its priorities, these occur in the course of its various arguments that no contempt occurred.  Perhaps as a result, the district court's brief discussion of priority issues is also directed not to damages but to contempt.  For this purpose, the district court's discussion is strictly speaking unnecessary, for reasons already given both by it and by us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellant waives arguments not made or only cursorily developed, e.g., Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir.1994), and in this instance the bank can be reproached on both grounds:  it makes no argument assuming contempt arguendo but challenging the computation of damages;  and to the extent it discusses the priority issues, the discussion is episodic, incomplete and (in certain respects) quite unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, there are scattered fragments out of which one might well try to build a case that the 1981 factor's lien or the 1986 liens and assignments gave the bank a priority as to amounts owing to Gemco.  The law in this area--both as to the Puerto Rico factor's lien statute and the assignment of accounts receivable statute--is at the same time both sparse (in explanatory case law) and complex (in statutory language).  See 10 L.P.R.A. Secs. 551 et seq.  (Factor's Lien Act);  10 L.P.R.A. Secs. 581 et seq.  (Assignment of Accounts Receivable Act).  The security transactions in this case are multiple, interrelated and in certain respects peculiar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have now spent an undue amount of time seeking a clear path through this morass in a futile effort to determine whether or not the bank possessed valid priorities that could be used to reduce or even eliminate the damage claims against it.  Although we spare the reader a description of false starts and dead ends and remaining perplexities, the conclusion is clear:  there is no way to answer the central question, short of a remand, extensive further briefing and probably further fact-finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the bank's effective waiver of the damages argument, no such remand can be justified.  We cannot require the district court or Seiko to engage in further litigation based on a mere suspicion that the bank might have an argument for curtailing damages.  It is ironic that, had the bank permitted the funds to be paid into court instead of diverting them to its own uses, the ensuing litigation would likely have focused on its priority rights rather than its contempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This litigation by Gemco was ultimately unsuccessful.

The district court found that Royal Bank had assisted in frustrating the application of an attachment order to assets that Royal Bank claimed for its own.

(\"Gemco\") in the amount of $3.16 million plus interest.  Earlier Gemco had been the exclusive distributor for Seiko watches and clocks in Puerto Rico.  Initially Gemco was wholly owned and operated by Jose and Carmen Pascual, as was a related company, the Watch and Gem Palace, Inc.  (\"Watch and Gem\");  later Jose Pascual (\"Pascual\") became the sole owner.  Gemco served as a wholesale distributor for jewelry and time pieces, while Watch and Gem operated two retail stores specializing in jewelry and time pieces (the Plaza Las Americas store and the Old San Juan Store).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1981, Royal Bank began extending credit to Gemco secured by a factor's lien on Gemco's inventory and accounts receivable under Puerto Rico's Factor's Lien Act, 10 L.P.R.A.

Gemco thereafter transferred most of the funds it borrowed from Royal Bank to Watch and Gem in order to finance Watch and Gem's retail operations;  these transfers were recorded in Watch and Gem's books as intercompany accounts payable and in Gemco's books as intercompany accounts receivable.  By early 1986 Royal Bank had extended credit to Gemco which exceeded $1.4 million, and Gemco's books showed an account receivable due from Watch and Gem of $2.15 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1986, Royal Bank sought to restructure and resecure Gemco's debt, as well as a much smaller debt then owed to the bank by Watch and Gem.  To this end, Royal Bank obtained new factor's liens from both Gemco and Watch and Gem, assignments of Gemco's and Watch and Gem's accounts receivable including all \"intercompany receivables,\" cross-guaranties from Gemco, Watch and Gem and the Pascuals, and mortgages on various properties owned by the Pascuals.  The amount owing to the bank from Gemco at the time of restructuring was $1.25 million, while Watch and Gem owed the bank just $125,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1986, Seiko obtained a $2.85 million arbitration award against Gemco in New York, stemming from Gemco's failure to pay for goods that Seiko had provided to Gemco.  The award was confirmed by the district of New York on November 4, 1986, and judgment was entered for Seiko on November 12, 1986, for $3,167,946.49.  The New York judgment was registered in the district court in Puerto Rico on December 16, 1986, and on January 13, 1987, that court issued an attachment order and accompanying writ of execution to satisfy Seiko's $3.16 million judgment against Gemco.  The order attached the following assets of Gemco:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>1) All debts and accounts receivable belonging to Gemco, including those owing from The Watch and Gem Palace, Inc. and Timekeepers, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>2) The bank accounts in the name of Gemco in the Royal Bank of Canada (Current Account No. 132-420-1) and the Plaza Scotia Bank (Current Account No. 006-1919-14).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>3) Merchandise inventory consisting of Seiko watches and clocks and Colirbri brand lighters, located at the fourth floor of the building at 204 San Jose Street, Old San Juan, Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>4) An IBM System 36 Computer with peripheral equipment located at the second floor of the building at 204 San Jose, Street, Old San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order also instructed Gemco's various debtors to remit any amounts owed to Gemco into court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>The Marshal shall also be instructed to notify the present order to The Watch and Gem Palace, Inc.;   Timekeepers, Inc.;   The Royal Bank of Canada, and the Plaza Scotiabank, and to instruct said parties to refrain, upon penalty of contempt, from making any other payments to Gemco by concept of monies owed from any of the attached debts, accounts receivable or bank accounts.  The Marshal shall collect any amounts belonging to Gemco presently deposited in any of the aforementioned bank accounts.  Any other amounts owed to Gemco by any of the aforementioned under any of the attached debts, accounts receivable or bank accounts shall be henceforth remitted to this Court ..., where in due course, it shall be claimed by Seiko Time Corporation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of execution, Gemco's primary asset was the account receivable arising from the various intercompany loans it had made to Watch and Gem over the years;  the account then stood at around $2 million.  Also at the time of execution, Gemco still owed Royal Bank around $1.05 million, while Watch and Gem owed the bank nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Royal Bank was served with a copy of the order of attachment on January 20, 1987.  The very next day the bank obtained from Pascual an assignment of any proceeds derived from the contemplated sale of Watch and Gem's Plazas Las Americas store, purportedly as further security for Watch and Gem's guaranty of Gemco's debt.  On April 27, 1987, Watch and Gem sold its Plazas Las Americas store for $850,000.  By agreement, the purchase price was disbursed directly to Royal Bank--minus back rent due Watch and Gem's landlord.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the $850,000 purchase price, Royal Bank received $797,219.73, which was fully credited against Gemco's indebtedness, ostensibly under Watch and Gem's March 1986 guaranty.  This reduced Gemco's total debt to Royal Bank to $300,357.71 as of June 30, 1987.  On that day, Watch and Gem then assumed the balance of Gemco's indebtedness by taking a $300,357.71 loan from Royal Bank.  According to Royal Bank, this loan simply erased Gemco's debt and created an equivalent debt in Watch and Gem's name;  Watch and Gem never received any money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the same time, Royal Bank also extended a line of credit to Watch and Gem for \"working capital\".  Through December 1987, Watch and Gem borrowed a total of $200,000 from the bank.  Watch and Gem used the proceeds from this new loan to pay off Gemco's creditors other than Seiko, in order to maintain Gemco as a viable entity so that it could continue a New York lawsuit that Gemco had brought against Seiko.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  During this time, Royal Bank also made some direct payments to Watch and Gem's creditor.  At no point did Watch and Gem pay into court the amount originally owing on the intercompany debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seiko eventually learned of Watch and Gem's payments to Gemco's other creditors and Watch and Gem's satisfaction of Gemco's debt to Royal Bank.  On July 10, 1987, Seiko moved for a finding of contempt against Gemco, Watch and Gem and the Pascuals.  After a hearing, the Puerto Rico district court on January 21, 1988, held Gemco, Watch and Gem and the Pascuals in contempt for violating the attachment order and diverting Gemco assets away from Seiko.  On March 18, 1988, Seiko filed a motion for contempt against Royal Bank and request for damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, on March 22, 1988, Pascual moved for court permission to sell the inventory from Watch and Gem's Old San Juan store in order \"to apply the proceeds to the indebtedness [Watch and Gem] owes to the Royal Bank of Canada.\"   In late June, before any sale took place, Royal Bank seized the inventory of the Old San Juan store--purportedly acting under an order issued by a local court--to protect its collateral for the loans it had extended to Watch and Gem starting in June 1987.  Royal Bank's seizure occurred shortly before its show cause hearing in the district court on the contempt charge, which took place on July 15, 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 27, 1994, the district court issued an 18-page order finding Royal Bank in contempt.  The court found that Royal Bank had aided and abetted a violation of the January 13, 1987, attachment order by utilizing Watch and Gem funds to repay Gemco's debts instead of paying that money into court.  The district court then assessed damages against Royal Bank, reasoning that if not improperly diverted, the funds would have eventually gone to Seiko.  The court calculated damages to be $1.63 million (plus attorney's fees and costs later fixed at $64,954.25) as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>1. $797,219.73 from the sale of Watch and Gem's Plazas Las Americas store, the proceeds of which were paid directly to Royal Bank;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>2. $52,780.27 that Royal Bank directed to the landlord for Watch and Gem's Plazas Las Americas store;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>3. $250,000 that had constituted a \"loan\" to Watch and Gem from Royal Bank, which Watch and Gem had used to pay Gemco's third-party creditors and which Royal Bank had used to pay Watch and Gem's creditors directly;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>4. $530,000 from Royal Bank's seizure of inventory from Watch and Gem's Old San Juan store, which blocked the sale of the store to a willing buyer for the purchase price of that amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a district court's contempt order, we accept the district court's factual findings and reasonable inferences if not clearly erroneous.

A civil contempt must be established by clear and convincing evidence and the underlying order must be clear and unambiguous in its terms.  Id. at 16.

Alternatively, Royal Bank argues that it had a superior claim to seize the Gemco and Watch and Gem assets in question despite Seiko's attachment.  We will address each of these issues, and one other, in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. By its terms the January 13, 1987, order attached \"[a]ll debts and accounts receivable belonging to Gemco ... owing from [Watch and Gem]\" and directed that apart from Gemco bank accounts (which the marshal was to collect), \"[a]ny other amounts owed to Gemco by [Watch and Gem] ... shall be henceforth remitted to this Court....\"  We think that a reasonably straightforward reading of this order required Watch and Gem to pay over to the district court the amount that Watch and Gem then owed to Gemco, which was well over $1 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, there followed a series of payments to recipients other than the court--primarily by Watch and Gem, or out of its assets--to the advantage of Royal Bank.  The first and largest of these payments was the diversion of proceeds from the sale of Watch and Gem's Plazas Las Americas store;  the bank received $797,219.73, which it used to reduce Gemco's outstanding debt to the bank, and by pre-arrangement over $50,000 went to Gemco's landlord.  This transaction occurred in April 1987, well after the bank had been notified of the attachment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the bank has filed a 45-page brief, it is not easy to discern from that document precisely why the bank thinks that these payments were consistent with the \"henceforth remitted\" directive in the court's order.  The brief explains why the bank cannot be deemed to have violated other provisions of the order but it largely ignores the provision directing Watch and Gem to pay what it owed to Gemco directly to the court, a provision stressed in the district court's contempt order.  Queen Victoria's famous phrase, \"We are not amused,\" is remarkably apt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bank does argue that Watch and Gem's payment to the bank was made to discharge Watch and Gem's own allegedly legitimate guaranty of Gemco's obligations to the bank.  But paying the bank instead of the court, when there is not enough money for both, still violates the attachment order.  The bank says that the attachment order did not forbid Watch and Gem from paying its own debts, but an $800,000 payment of another debt patently frustrated the clear intent of the order that Watch and Gem's money be held for Seiko.  Cf. General Motors Acceptance Corp. v. Superior Court, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span>, 319 (1962) (\"[garnished] funds are symbolically in the custody of the law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we reject the bank's contention, offered as a defense to the charge of contempt, that its claims against Watch and Gem assets had priority.  As the district court correctly explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>Watch &amp; Gem was ordered to remit to the Court the amount owed GEMCO, for the ultimate benefit of SEIKO TIME.  The court did not limit or restrict its Order to the payment of funds which were free of third-party claims;  rather, the Court ordered that such funds were to be paid into Court so that the Court could then resolve any question of priorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Watch and Gem's assets were subject to claims prior to the attachment order, the proper course was to pay the money into court and then litigate the matter or, possibly, to ask the district court to modify its attachment.  See 32 L.P.R.A.App. III, R. 21.5 (right to intervene of third parties claiming property attached by order of the court);  R. 21.6 (motion to release property).  But self-help, in the teeth of the court's order, was not permissible.

Here the bank not only fostered but appears to have orchestrated the violations.  The district court found that the bank had worked \"hand in glove\" with Pascual, Gemco and Watch and Gem, \"controll[ed] all flow of monies to and from those parties,\" and \"determin[ed] the corporate strategy of those parties\" in order \"to avoid the scrutiny of the courts and maximize [the bank's] collections on its loans to [Gemco].\"  Royal Bank's brief in this court makes no serious effort to show that these finding were clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The district court ruled that Seiko was damaged not only by the diversion of proceeds to the bank from the Plazas Las Americas sale but also by the diversion of about $50,000 from the same sale to Watch and Gem's landlord;  by the later disbursements of about $250,000 to other Gemco and Watch and Gem creditors;  and still later by the bank's seizure of inventory from the Old San Juan store, frustrating a planned sale of that store to a third party for about $530,000.  Implicit in this damage calculation is the view that each of these payments (or, in the last case, frustration of payment) was also a violation of the court's attachment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is easy enough a conclusion as to the $52,000 paid to the landlord.  This payment was part of a prearranged allocation of the proceeds of the sale;  the bank, which took the lion's share for itself, was clearly involved in the allocation, and the allocation of the $52,000 violated the court's \"henceforth remitted\" directive for reasons already discussed in connection with the $797,000 payment.  Having helped arrange these diversions, the bank is responsible for the full effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It less clear that the same view should be taken of the $250,000 in payments to third-party creditors of Gemco and Watch and Gem or the $530,000 loss that occurred when the bank frustrated the sale of the Old San Juan store.  The former were apparently included on the theory that they represented funds belonging to Watch and Gem that, like the $850,000 in proceeds from the original sale, were diverted to creditors of Gemco and Watch and Gem instead of being paid into court.  The $250,000 was a loan by the bank to Watch and Gem which, by prearrangement with the bank, was designed to pay off various Gemco creditors other than Seiko, thereby forestalling an involuntary bankruptcy petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the $250,000 is treated as Watch and Gem's money, then the analysis is the same as with the $850,000.  The bank might have argued that the $250,000 actually represented bank money to which Watch and Gem had no claim and that there is something odd about treating the bank's own decision to pay off Gemco creditors with the bank's own funds as depriving Seiko of Watch and Gem assets.  Still, having structured the transaction as a loan to Watch and Gem--presumably to give the bank a claim for repayment--the bank may have thought it dangerous to describe the loan as a sham.  Anyway, it does not try to distinguish the $250,000 payment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the $530,000 loss, this was charged to the bank because it frustrated the sale of the Old San Juan store by seizing Watch and Gem assets, effectively violating the attachment order.  Although it appears that the bank did cause the loss, it might have argued that the proposed sale was its own creation (it had proposed to finance the third-party buyer) and that, without its cooperation, there would have been no sale even without its seizure of the inventory.  But again the bank makes no such argument, and instead implies (quite incorrectly) that the local court's alleged approval of the seizure trumped the district court's attachment order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the bank has chosen to fight on a broader front--primarily by denying that anyone's action violated the attachment order or that it aided and abetted any such violation.  Absent extraordinary circumstances, we confine ourselves in civil cases to the arguments made by the parties.  FDIC v. Fedders Air Conditioning, USA, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195610\"><a href=\"/opinion/195610/fdic-v-fedders-air-cond/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.1994).  Whether or not the bank might have distinguished among the damage items and sought to limit its exposure, it has not done so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.  Even though Royal Bank's conduct violated the attachment order and diverted or blocked the funds that would otherwise have been paid into court, Royal Bank is liable in a civil contempt proceeding only for actual damages.  In re Power Recovery Systems, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573066\"><a href=\"/opinion/573066/in-re-power-recovery-systems-inc-debtor-two-cases-david-w-eck-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span>, 802 (1st Cir.1991).  In this instance, the bank could arguably defeat the damage award--although not the finding of contempt--by showing that the money paid into court would ultimately have been awarded to the bank rather than Seiko.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither in the district court nor in this court has the bank ever made this argument in a straightforward fashion.  Although there are a number of references to its priorities, these occur in the course of its various arguments that no contempt occurred.  Perhaps as a result, the district court's brief discussion of priority issues is also directed not to damages but to contempt.  For this purpose, the district court's discussion is strictly speaking unnecessary, for reasons already given both by it and by us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appellant waives arguments not made or only cursorily developed, e.g., Grella v. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684074\"><a href=\"/opinion/684074/paul-j-grella-trustee-v-salem-five-cent-savings-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.1994), and in this instance the bank can be reproached on both grounds:  it makes no argument assuming contempt arguendo but challenging the computation of damages;  and to the extent it discusses the priority issues, the discussion is episodic, incomplete and (in certain respects) quite unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, there are scattered fragments out of which one might well try to build a case that the 1981 factor's lien or the 1986 liens and assignments gave the bank a priority as to amounts owing to Gemco.  The law in this area--both as to the Puerto Rico factor's lien statute and the assignment of accounts receivable statute--is at the same time both sparse (in explanatory case law) and complex (in statutory language).  See 10 L.P.R.A. Secs. 551 et seq.  (Factor's Lien Act);  10 L.P.R.A. Secs. 581 et seq.  (Assignment of Accounts Receivable Act).  The security transactions in this case are multiple, interrelated and in certain respects peculiar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have now spent an undue amount of time seeking a clear path through this morass in a futile effort to determine whether or not the bank possessed valid priorities that could be used to reduce or even eliminate the damage claims against it.  Although we spare the reader a description of false starts and dead ends and remaining perplexities, the conclusion is clear:  there is no way to answer the central question, short of a remand, extensive further briefing and probably further fact-finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the bank's effective waiver of the damages argument, no such remand can be justified.  We cannot require the district court or Seiko to engage in further litigation based on a mere suspicion that the bank might have an argument for curtailing damages.  It is ironic that, had the bank permitted the funds to be paid into court instead of diverting them to its own uses, the ensuing litigation would likely have focused on its priority rights rather than its contempt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This litigation by Gemco was ultimately unsuccessful.
