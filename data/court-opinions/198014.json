Thomas Dutkiewicz was fired by his\r\nemployer, Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc., after he\r\nrepeatedly complained he felt his supervisors were pressuring him\r\nto violate Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") regulations for\r\nhauling hazardous materials, and that he would not do that.  The\r\ncompany said he was fired because customers complained about his\r\nabrasive manner.  Dutkiewicz complained to the company that he had\r\nbeen unfairly and unlawfully terminated.  The company rehired\r\nDutkiewicz for a different position, kept him on a short leash, and\r\nfired him three months later.\r\nDutkiewicz filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of\r\nLabor under the employee protection provisions of the Safety\r\nTransportation Assistance Act of 1982 (\"STAA\"), 49 U.S.C.  31105,\r\nclaiming both his employment terminations were in retaliation for\r\nhis safety complaints and his refusal to violate federal\r\nregulations.  The Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), in a\r\nrecommended decision and order, found in favor of Dutkiewicz and\r\nawarded back pay, reinstatement, and compensatory damages.  The\r\nAdministrative Review Board (\"ARB\") affirmed the ALJ's\r\nrecommendation and also upheld the damages award.  Clean Harbors\r\npetitions for review to this court, raising one pure issue of law\r\nand arguments that the ARB decision is not supported by substantial\r\nevidence.\r\nWhen an employee has \"filed a complaint or begun a\r\nproceeding,\" the STAA, 49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(A), protects that\r\nemployee from retaliatory adverse employment actions.  The question\r\nof law, one of first impression in this court, is whether this\r\nsection protects an employee who has filed purely intracorporate\r\ncomplaints about alleged violations of federal law.  We agree with\r\nthe ARB's interpretation that it does.  We also find that\r\nsubstantial evidence supports the ARB's findings that Dutkiewicz in\r\nfact \"filed\" such internal complaints, and that his employment\r\nterminations were causally related to that protected activity.\r\n                          I.\r\nA.  Factual Background\r\nClean Harbors is an environmental services company based\r\nin Braintree, Massachusetts.  Its services include treating,\r\nstoring, hauling, and disposing of hazardous waste.  Dutkiewicz\r\nbegan working for Clean Harbors as a truck driver in August of\r\n1993, out of the company's service center in New Britain,\r\nConnecticut.  Dutkiewicz' primary duty was to haul hazardous waste\r\nbetween the customers' facilities and Clean Harbors' treatment\r\nplant in Bristol, Connecticut.  This job required Dutkiewicz to\r\ninspect the waste containers for compliance with the law, to\r\ninventory, and to load the waste containers onto his truck before\r\nhauling them.  All of these activities are governed by DOT and\r\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") regulations.  If customers\r\ndo not properly prepare their drums of waste for shipment, the\r\ndriver must spend time at the customers' facilities bringing the\r\ndrums into compliance with the regulations.\r\nWhen Dutkiewicz began working for Clean Harbors he\r\nreceived training on compliance with DOT regulations.  Dutkiewicz\r\nalso studied the regulations on his own, and had prior work\r\nexperience in hauling hazardous materials.  No one seriously\r\nquestioned Dutkiewicz' familiarity with the various regulations\r\nthat governed his work activities.\r\nThor Cheyne was the general manager of the New Britain\r\nservice center during Dutkiewicz' initial tenure with Clean\r\nHarbors.  Dutkiewicz reported to Cheyne, as well as to Dave Mills,\r\nwho was Dutkiewicz' job coordinator.  Peter Ferrio and Peter Doyle\r\nwere customer account managers who dealt with the customers to whom\r\nDutkiewicz was assigned.  No single individual at the New Britain\r\nfacility was specifically assigned the task of ensuring compliance\r\nwith the environmental and safety regulations; instead, each\r\ndriver was individually responsible for ensuring regulatory\r\ncompliance on his own jobs.\r\nSoon after Dutkiewicz started working for Clean Harbors,\r\nthe company began charging customers for \"demurrage,\" or extra time\r\nthe drivers spent at the customers' facilities filling out\r\npaperwork and bringing the shipments into compliance for hauling. \r\nPreviously the customers were charged by the job, rather than by\r\nthe amount of time the driver took to complete the job.  After this\r\nnew charge was imposed, several large-account customers began\r\ncomplaining about Dutkiewicz.  According to the company, the\r\ncustomers complained that he was taking too much time at their\r\nfacilities, second-guessing their shipment preparation, and costing\r\nthem too much money.  In turn, several of the New Britain personnel\r\n-- Cheyne, Ferrio, and Doyle in particular -- pressured Dutkiewicz\r\nto stop \"wasting time\" on site.\r\nDutkiewicz responded to this pressure saying the\r\ncustomers who complained were the ones who had the most problems\r\nwith their shipments, and he took the extra time to bring their\r\ndrums of hazardous waste into compliance before loading them on to\r\nhis truck.  Dutkiewicz stressed that it was his obligation to\r\nensure regulatory compliance, that he personally could be put at\r\nrisk, and he would not violate the law and endanger himself and\r\nothers.\r\nAs the pressure to perform fast pick-ups continued,\r\nDutkiewicz became increasingly frustrated with what he believed\r\nwere demands to violate the law, and he decided to document the\r\nsituation.  In early January 1994, Dutkiewicz designed his own drum\r\ninspection form.  The form listed all of the regulatory\r\nrequirements and provided space for the driver to document whether\r\nthe customer had complied with the requirements or whether the\r\ndriver had to spend time fixing the shipments.  Dutkiewicz gave\r\ncopies to the customer service department and to Cheyne, and\r\nsubsequently used the forms to document each of his pick-ups. \r\nDutkiewicz hoped the forms would clarify why he was spending time\r\nat the customers' facilities and prove that he was not \"wasting\r\ntime.\"\r\nIn early February 1994, Dutkiewicz received a six-month\r\nperformance appraisal from Cheyne.  Dutkiewicz' overall performance\r\nwas said to \"meet expectations\" and he was given a raise.  In one\r\nof the \"comments\" sections, Cheyne wrote that \"Tom's thoroughness\r\nhas raised several questions with customers as to his productivity. \r\nTom should continue his quality in that it is quality that\r\ncustomers are buying from [Clean Harbors].\"\r\nIn early March, in response to continued pressure from\r\nCheyne and Ferrio to spend less time preparing drums, Dutkiewicz\r\nwrote a letter to Clean Harbors president Alan McKim.  The letter\r\nstated, inter alia:\r\n     I would like to address when a bad drum\r\nis accepted.  Clean Harbors and everybody else\r\nconnected with the drum owns all the problems\r\nthat go with it.  Thor [Cheyne] didn't know if\r\nit was a Tom [Dutkiewicz] problem or a\r\ncustomer problem . . . .  So I designed a form\r\nfor myself to show all concerned what the\r\ndrums were like when I arrived on site, were\r\nthe problems solved, and were any [drums]\r\nrefused [by the driver].\r\n     Now when a customer ask [sic] why they\r\nwere charged for extra time, Thor has\r\ndocumentation on what I did to correct the\r\nproblem that a customer should have done to\r\nmake them DOT shippable.  I've included a copy\r\nof this form for your review.      \r\nSometime in mid-March, Cheyne and Ferrio scolded\r\nDutkiewicz for taking too much time at the facility of one company,\r\na major Clean Harbors account.  Dutkiewicz gave his usual response,\r\nand invited Cheyne to accompany him on his next run to the company\r\nto see for himself that the drums were not in compliance.  Cheyne\r\nturned down the offer.\r\nOn April 18, 1994, Cheyne wrote Dutkiewicz this note:\r\nTom, I would like you to get in and out of\r\n[the customer's premises] w/o demurrage or\r\nextra time regardless of condition of drums. \r\nThor\r\nT.T. [Talk To] me if you have any questions.\r\nThe note was attached to a memorandum from John Shomsky -- a\r\ncustomer service representative -- which stated that the customer\r\nhad complained about Dutkiewicz wasting time on site.  Dutkiewicz\r\nunderstood the note to be a direction from his supervisor to accept\r\nand haul drums even if the drums did not comply with DOT\r\nregulations.  \r\nThe Cheyne note became the smoking gun in this dispute. \r\nClean Harbors argues that this note was in fact a direction to\r\nleave behind any non-compliant drums, not a direction to haul them. \r\nBut the ALJ and the ARB rejected that interpretation of the note\r\nfor several reasons.  Cheyne himself did not testify, and a Clean\r\nHarbors employee testified that the note could plausibly be read as\r\nDutkiewicz read it.  The evidence adequately supports the agency's\r\ninterpretation of the note.  \r\nDutkiewicz responded to the note by writing a letter to\r\nCheyne and Shomsky, dated April 19, 1994, stating:\r\n     First I would like to address the last\r\npickup from [the customer].  From the time I\r\narrived until Irene came down 20 minutes\r\npassed.  She had visible waste on three drums,\r\nthree drums didn't have any poison or\r\ncorrosive label on them, and two drums had lid\r\nrings up side [sic] down.  She has problems\r\nmaking her drums shippable.\r\n     The DOT is not very forgiving if I get\r\nstopped because of [sic] one of my drums is\r\nleaking.  No driver in this company will\r\naccept a drum that is not DOT shippable just\r\nto make the customer happy.  Not only will I\r\nget in trouble, its [sic] against the law.\r\n. . . .\r\n     The problems relating to customers\r\ncomplaining didn't start until the customer\r\nwas charged for time spent on site to correct\r\ndrums. And the ones that complained were the\r\nones that have trouble making their drums\r\nshippable.  \r\n     Believe me when I say it, I have a lot\r\nof ground to cover in a course of a day.  I\r\ndon't have time to waste on purpose at a\r\ncustomers [sic] just to make more hours. \r\nThere is no such saying, there is a faster way\r\nof making a drums [sic] shippable.  And as\r\nlong as people like Irene . . . have improper\r\ndrums, I will have to spend time making them\r\nright.  Irene is not in transportation, what\r\nshe thinks is shippable may very well be not\r\nshippable according to the DOT.  That's my\r\njob, is to determine what is or what isn't\r\nshippable.\r\n. . . . \r\n     In conclusion, . . . I refused [sic] to\r\nbe blamed for this or other shippers [who are\r\nunable] to properly label, mark, and secure\r\ndrums.  Yes, the customer is always right, up\r\nto a point.  No one should be abused by\r\ncustomers or be put at risk because of a\r\ncustomer.  There are a lot of clients out\r\nthere who really don't care.\r\n     . . . If you think I'm wrong in my\r\nwhole assessment, please feel free to call\r\nTony Cellucci or Kent Bongarzone [compliance\r\ndepartment supervisors] and we can discuss\r\nthis matter in further detail.\r\nThe record reveals no effort on the part of Cheyne or Ferrio to\r\ncontact the compliance department, or to determine whether or not\r\nDutkiewicz was correct that the customers were not properly\r\npreparing their hazardous materials for shipment.\r\nDutkiewicz also showed the Cheyne note to Dave Cyr, the\r\nClean Harbors operations manager at the Bristol, Connecticut\r\nfacility, and to Brian Peterson, the general manager of the\r\nBristol facility.  Dutkiewicz testified that he \"told Dave Cyr [he]\r\nwas concerned about protecting [him]self in the future,\" and that\r\nhe \"also wanted to alert them that Thor Cheyne was instructing\r\nClean Harbors' personnel to engage in practices contrary to EPA and\r\nDOT regulations.\"\r\nOn September 1, 1994, Cheyne gave Dutkiewicz his second\r\nperformance review.  He rated Dutkiewicz' overall performance as\r\n\"meets expectations,\" and gave Dutkiewicz a raise.  \r\nTwo weeks later, Ferrio sent a memorandum to Cheyne\r\nstating that Ferrio had received more complaints about Dutkiewicz. \r\nFerrio suggested that Cheyne either replace Dutkiewicz or find\r\nanother job for him in which there was no customer contact.  Later\r\nthat same day Ferrio wrote another note to Cheyne indicating that\r\nif Cheyne failed to take proper action Ferrio would \"go over\r\n[Cheyne's] head.\"  Three days later, September 19, 1994, Cheyne did\r\nas Ferrio asked and fired Dutkiewicz.  He told Dutkiewicz that\r\ncustomers were upset because he was wasting too much time fixing\r\ndrums.\r\nDutkiewicz immediately phoned and wrote Steven Pozner,\r\nthe company vice president for compliance, health and safety. \r\nDutkiewicz complained that his discharge resulted from Cheyne's\r\nlack of understanding of the DOT regulations, Cheyne's immediate\r\nimpulse to side with the customers and customer service managers,\r\nand Dutkiewicz' refusal to cut corners.  Dutkiewicz requested that\r\nthe corporate office investigate his discharge and reinstate him.\r\nThe company initially upheld the termination.  When\r\nDutkiewicz' wife phoned Tony Celluci, director of transportation\r\ncompliance, and threatened to report the termination to the federal\r\ngovernment and the media, the company offered Dutkiewicz three\r\nweeks of paid leave and agreed to investigate the termination\r\nfurther.  Clean Harbors hired a consultant, who ultimately\r\nsuggested that Dutkiewicz could be reinstated, albeit with strict\r\nsupervision and under a rigid chain of command. \r\nIn late October, 1994, Clean Harbors reinstated\r\nDutkiewicz as a driver based at the Bristol facility.  His new job\r\nwas to haul waste between the company's own facilities, rather than\r\nfrom customers' facilities.  The new job offer was conditioned on\r\nDutkiewicz' acceptance of a strict chain of command:  Dutkiewicz\r\nwas to direct any questions or comments only to John Caron, the\r\nBristol Transportation Coordinator, or to Brian Monahan, the\r\nBristol Director of Logistics.  When Dutkiewicz started work, he\r\nmet with Caron and Monahan who informed Dutkiewicz that he was \"on\r\na short leash.\"\r\nDutkiewicz testified that over the next few months he\r\nnoticed a number of DOT regulations violations, and reported them\r\nto his supervisors and corporate compliance personnel.  Monahan\r\nterminated Dutkiewicz on January 16, 1995, stating simply that\r\nthings were not working out and Dutkiewicz and Clean Harbors were\r\na bad match.\r\nB.  Procedural Background\r\nAfter he was fired the second time, Dutkiewicz filed a\r\ntimely complaint with the Department of Labor (\"DOL\"), claiming\r\nClean Harbors terminated him (twice) in violation of the employee\r\nprotection provision of the STAA.  That provision reads:\r\n(a) Prohibitions. (1) A person may not\r\ndischarge an employee regarding pay, terms, or\r\nprivileges of employment, because --\r\n     (A) the employee, or another person at\r\nthe employee's request, has filed a complaint\r\nor begun a proceeding related to a violation\r\nof a commercial motor vehicle safety\r\nregulation, standard, or order, or has\r\ntestified or will testify in such a\r\nproceeding; or\r\n     (B) the employee refuses to operate a\r\nvehicle because --\r\n          (i) the operation violates a\r\nregulation, standard, or order of the United\r\nStates related to commercial motor vehicle\r\nsafety or health; or\r\n          (ii) the employee has a reasonable\r\napprehension of serious injury to the employee\r\nor the public because of the vehicle's unsafe\r\ncondition.\r\n\n49 U.S.C.  31105(a).  After investigation, the OSHA Regional\r\nAdministrator (acting pursuant to DOL regulations) found that\r\nDutkiewicz' claim was unsupported, and dismissed the complaint. \r\nDutkiewicz objected to the findings and had a hearing before an\r\nALJ.\r\nThe ALJ, who credited Dutkiewicz' testimony, found that\r\nDutkiewicz had engaged in protected activity under both  31105\r\n(a)(1)(A) and (B), and that both of his employment terminations\r\nwere related to these protected activities.  As for  (a)(1)(A),\r\nthe ALJ found that, before the first of his employment\r\nterminations, Dutkiewicz continuously complained to Cheyne that he\r\nwas pressured by the customer service personnel and by Cheyne to\r\nviolate DOT regulations.  The ALJ also found that, \"with respect to\r\nrefusal to operate a vehicle [ (a)(1)(B)], complainant has\r\npresented evidence by his own testimony, supported by his\r\ncontemporaneously prepared drum inspection forms, that he\r\ncontinuously refused to drive Clean Harbors vehicles containing\r\nhazardous materials that he believed violated DOT regulations.\" \r\nThe ALJ agreed that customer complaints could be a valid reason for\r\ndischarging an employee, but found that Clean Harbors fired\r\nDutkiewicz because he refused to compromise his fastidious\r\ncompliance with the regulations, thereby angering customers and\r\njeopardizing accounts.  The ALJ also found that the second firing\r\nwas inextricably linked to the first unlawful dismissal.  The ALJ\r\nconcluded that Clean Harbors had violated the STAA, and ordered\r\ndamages and reinstatement for Dutkiewicz.  \r\nThe ARB found that the ALJ's \"findings of fact . . . are\r\nsupported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and\r\ntherefore are conclusive.\"  See 29 C.F.R.  1978.109(c)(3).  It\r\nalso adopted the ALJ's assessments of witness credibility.  The ARB\r\nthen affirmed the ALJ's decision to order damages and\r\nreinstatement, but it did so based solely on the fact that\r\nDutkiewicz' termination was related to his protected activity of\r\n\"fil[ing] a complaint.\"\r\n                         II.\r\nWe review the ARB's final decision in accordance with the\r\ndictates of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  701 et\r\nseq.  The ARB's decision must be affirmed unless its legal\r\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in\r\naccordance with law, or its factual conclusions are unsupported by\r\nsubstantial evidence.  See 5 U.S.C.  706(2); Castle Coal &amp; Oil Co.v. Reich, 55 F.3d 41, 44 (2d Cir. 1995).\r\nA.  Statutory Interpretation\r\nDutkiewicz filed no complaints with a court or government\r\nagency before his first employment termination.  Thus, the ARB's\r\ndetermination that Dutkiewicz engaged in protected activity depends\r\nentirely upon a reading of  31105(a)(1)(A) to cover complaints\r\nwhich are purely internal to the employer.  This interpretation of\r\n\"filed a complaint or begun a proceeding\" raises an issue of law.\r\nCiting its own precedent, the ARB found that \"[a]n\r\nemployee's internal complaint to superiors conveying his reasonable\r\nbelief that the company was engaging in a violation of a motor\r\nvehicle safety regulation is a protected activity under [\r\n31105(a)(1)(A)].\"  Dutkiewicz v. Clean Harbors Envtl. Servs., Case\r\nNo. 97-STA-090, Sec. Dec. and Ord., Aug. 8, 1997, slip op. at 3-4\r\n(\"ARB Dec.\") (citing Stiles v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., Case No.\r\n92-STA-34, Sec. Dec. and Ord., Sept 24, 1993, slip op. at 3-4).\r\nClean Harbors argues that the ARB's interpretation of the\r\nSTAA is in contravention of that statute's plain meaning, and that\r\n\"this ['filed a complaint or begun a proceeding'] language clearly\r\nconnotes the initiation of a formal administrative or court\r\nproceeding and not merely internal complaints.\"  Clean Harbors\r\ncontrasts this STAA language with the anti-retaliation provisions\r\nof other statutes, most notably, Title VII, which provides:\r\nIt shall be an unlawful employment practice\r\nfor an employer to discriminate against any of\r\nhis employees . . . because he has opposed any\r\npractice made an unlawful employment practice\r\nby this subchapter, or because he has made a\r\ncharge, testified, assisted, or participated\r\nin any manner in an investigation, proceeding,\r\nor hearing under this subchapter.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.  2000e-3.  According to Clean Harbors, because Congress\r\ncould have used this language in the STAA -- language which clearly\r\nprotects an employee who makes internal complaints -- it must have\r\nintended the narrower language it ultimately did use not to protect\r\nan employee who makes purely internal complaints.\r\nWe reject the company's interpretation that the STAA\r\nanti-retaliation protection is available only to employees who file\r\ncomplaints with a government agency or a court.  We do so for four\r\nreasons.  First, the language is susceptible to more than one\r\nreading.  Second, the Congress hewed to this language when it\r\nreenacted the STAA in 1994, in the face of long-standing\r\nadministrative interpretation of the STAA and similar language in\r\nother statutes to encompass internal complaints made to an\r\nemployer.  Third, in the absence of unambiguous statutory language,\r\nthis strikes us as the sort of interstitial law making which\r\nCongress left to the agency, under Chevron v. Natural Resources\r\nDefense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 843-44 (1984).  Fourth, the policy\r\nchoice made by the agency is eminently reasonable.  It is\r\nreasonable in terms of leveraging the government's limited\r\nenforcement resources.\r\nThe STAA was originally enacted in 1983.  The employee\r\nprotection provision, like other whistleblower statutes, was\r\nintended to create a climate in which employees would feel free to\r\nvoice their health and safety concerns without fear of employer\r\nretaliation.  See Brock v. Roadway Express, Inc., 481 U.S. 252, 257\r\n(1987) (\"Section [31105] was enacted in 1983 to encourage employee\r\nreporting of noncompliance with safety regulations governing\r\ncommercial motor vehicles.\").  \r\nThe STAA was recodified and reenacted in 1994, expressly\r\nwithout substantive change. See Revision of Title 49,\r\nTransportation, United States Code, Pub. L. 103-272,  1, 108 Stat.\r\n745, 990-91 (1994).  In the years between 1983 and 1994, the\r\nSecretary of Labor and two courts of appeals interpreted the\r\nemployee protection language to encompass purely internal\r\ncomplaints.  See Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. v. Reich, 8 F.3d 980,\r\n986 (4th Cir. 1993) (oral complaints to supervisor \"are protected\r\nactivity under the STAA\"); Moon v. Transport Drivers, Inc, 836 F.2d\r\n226, 227-29 (6th Cir. 1987) (finding that driver had engaged in\r\nprotected activity under the STAA where driver had made only oral\r\ncomplaints to supervisors); Stiles, Case No. 92-STA-34, slip op. at\r\n3-4 (citing cases); see also Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. v. Martin,\r\n983 F.2d 1195, 1198 (2d Cir. 1993) (implying but not specifically\r\nstating that employee's internal safety complaints were covered by\r\n31105(a)). \r\nIn addition, a large body of judicial case law developed,\r\nconsistently interpreting language either identical or very similar\r\nto the language in  31105(a)(1)(A) to encompass internal employee\r\ncomplaints.  See, e.g., Passaic Valley Sewerage Comm'rs v. United\r\nStates Dep't of Labor, 992 F.2d 474, 478 (3d Cir. 1993)\r\n(interpreting  507 of the Clean Water Act, which prohibits\r\nretaliation against an employee because the employee has \"filed\r\n[or] instituted . . . any proceeding under this chapter,\" to\r\ninclude the filing of intracorporate complaints); EEOC v. Romeo\r\nCommunity Sch. Dist, 976 F.2d 985, 989-90 (6th Cir. 1992)\r\n(interpreting Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"), 29 U.S.C. \r\n215(a)(3), which prohibits retaliation against an employee \"because\r\nsuch employee has filed any complaint or instituted . . . any\r\nproceeding under or related to [the FLSA],\" to protect employees\r\nwho make unofficial complaints to their supervisors); Rayner v.\r\nSmirl, 873 F.2d 60, 63-64 (4th Cir. 1989) (interpreting Federal\r\nRailway Safety Act (\"FRSA\"), 45 U.S.C.  441, which prohibits\r\nretaliation because an employee has \"filed any complaint or\r\ninstituted or caused to be instituted any proceeding\" under the\r\nFRSA or related safety laws, to protect employees who make purely\r\ninternal complaints); EEOC v. White and Son Enters., 881 F.2d 1006,\r\n1011 (11th Cir. 1989) (interpreting FLSA language, 29 U.S.C. \r\n215(a)(3), to include \"unofficial complaints expressed by the women\r\nto their employer\"); Love v. Re/Max of America, Inc., 738 F.2d 383,\r\n387 (10th Cir. 1984) (same).  But see Lambert v. Genesee Hosp., 10\r\nF.3d 46, 55 (2d Cir. 1993) (interpreting FLSA not to encompass\r\ncomplaints made to a supervisor).  \r\nCongress was surely aware of these administrative and\r\njudicial interpretations when it reenacted the STAA without\r\nsubstantive change.  See Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580\r\n(1978) (\"Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or\r\njudicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that\r\ninterpretation when it reenacts a statute without change.\").  If\r\nCongress wanted to restrict the protected activity in \r\n31105(a)(1)(A) to filing complaints with the courts or agencies, it\r\nwould have done so when it recodified the law.\r\nWe also find persuasive the Secretary of Labor's argument\r\nthat interpreting \"filed a complaint\" to encompass only filings\r\nwith a court or government agency would create a redundancy in the\r\nstatute.  The STAA protects employees who have \"filed a complaint\"\r\nor \"begun a proceeding.\"  49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(A).  A court or\r\nagency filing itself \"beg[ins] a proceeding,\" and the \"file a\r\ncomplaint\" language would thus be superfluous on Clean Harbors'\r\nreading of the statute.  See Bailey v. United States, 516 U.S. 137,\r\n146 (1995) (\"We assume that Congress used two terms because it\r\nintended each term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning.\"). \r\nMoreover, the ARB's interpretation is reasonable.  First,\r\nit is supported by the obvious policy of encouraging corporate\r\ncompliance with such laws by casting a broad net in the anti-\r\nretaliation provisions.  As the Supreme Court has noted in\r\ninterpreting an analogous whistleblower statute, \"it needs no\r\nargument to show that fear of economic retaliation might often\r\noperate to induce aggrieved employees to accept substandard\r\nconditions.\"  Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U.S.\r\n288, 292 (1960) (interpreting employee protection provision in\r\nFLSA).  A construction of the STAA that covers only complaints\r\nfiled with courts or government agencies would narrow the\r\nmechanisms to achieve these policy goals, leaving unprotected\r\nemployees who in good faith assert safety concerns to their\r\nemployers, or who indicate an unwillingness to engage in such\r\nviolations.  See Passaic Valley, 992 F.2d at 478 (\"Section 507(a)'s\r\nprotection would be largely hollow if it were restricted to the\r\npoint of filing a formal complaint with the appropriate external\r\nlaw enforcement agency.\"). \r\nInterpreting  31105(a)(1)(A) to protect only employees\r\nwho file external complaints would result in an anomalous and\r\ninefficient system.  The effect of the system urged by Clean\r\nHarbors would be to force employees with safety concerns to go\r\nstraight to the government.  A company's opportunity to remedy its\r\nown problems voluntarily and quietly would be lost.  Cf. id. at\r\n478-79.  Thus, the DOL's interpretation in many ways helps\r\ncompanies.  There is the contrary argument that companies will\r\nbenefit economically by reducing the number of employee complaints\r\nby making employees go to greater efforts to file a complaint with\r\nthe government.  That some employees (unhappy with company\r\npractices) may choose silence over going directly to the government\r\nmay indeed permit a company to skate by the requirements of the law\r\nfor a period, and (perhaps) temporarily benefit economically.  But\r\nthe penalties for noncompliance are high, and unhappy employees are\r\nlikely to help the government make its case once the government\r\ndoes become involved.  It is reasonable to conclude that the ARB's\r\nposition is fairer and less wasteful of resources for both the\r\ncorporate community and the government than the position offered by\r\nClean Harbors.\r\nClean Harbors does make one very telling argument:  that\r\nits interpretation of the statute provides clean and simple\r\nguidance on what a \"complaint\" is and the agency's interpretation\r\nunhelpfully leaves employers in the dark.  What sort of internal\r\ncomplaint is \"filing a complaint\" for purposes of the Act?  We\r\nthink the problem, while real, is not sufficient to invalidate the\r\nagency's interpretation, and may be dealt with as a matter of\r\nfactual analysis.\r\nThe ARB's construction of the STAA is plainly a\r\nreasonable and permissible one.\r\nB.  Substantial Evidence\r\nClean Harbors protests that there is not substantial\r\nevidence that what Dutkiewicz did amounted to filing a complaint or\r\nthat this activity is why Clean Harbors terminated his employment. \r\nSubstantial evidence is \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable\r\nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" \r\nRichardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971) (citation and\r\nquotation marks omitted).  \r\nA prima facie case of unlawful termination under the STAA\r\nrequires a showing that the employee engaged in protected activity,\r\nthat the employee was subjected to adverse employment action, and\r\nthat there was a causal connection between the protected activity\r\nand the adverse action.  See Moon, 836 F.2d at 229.  Clean Harbors\r\ntook adverse employment action against Dutkiewicz, but contests\r\nthat Dutkiewicz engaged in any protected activity, and that there\r\nwas a causal link between any protected activity and the adverse\r\nemployment action.\r\nThe familiar burden-shifting analysis employed under\r\nTitle VII has also been employed under the STAA.  Where a\r\ncomplainant has made out a prima facie case of retaliatory\r\ndischarge, the employer may rebut that showing with evidence of a\r\nlegitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the discharge.  The burden\r\nthen shifts back to the complainant to prove that the proffered\r\nreason is pretext for unlawful retaliation.  See id. (adapting\r\nframework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.\r\n792 (1973), to a STAA claim).  Where evidence of a dual motive\r\nexists, i.e., where there are legitimate reasons for a discharge in\r\naddition to the unlawful reasons, the employer bears the burden of\r\nestablishing by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have\r\ntaken the adverse employment action in the absence of the\r\nemployee's protected activity.  Cf. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,\r\n490 U.S. 228, 242 (1989).  Both parties have accepted this as the\r\nstandard and we do not reexamine it.\r\n1.  \"Filing\" a Complaint\r\nThe facts of record support the ARB's determination that\r\nthe activity in which Dutkiewicz engaged met the requirements for\r\n\"filing a complaint.\"  There is no problem of lack of fair notice\r\non this record and we affirm that there was substantial evidence\r\nthat Dutkiewicz \"filed a complaint.\"\r\nWe recognize Clean Harbors' legitimate due process\r\nconcerns that the internal communications to the employer must be\r\nsufficient to give notice that a complaint is being filed and thus\r\nthat the activity is protected.  In the absence of such notice, the\r\nbeneficial purposes of the act cannot be accomplished.  Clearly\r\nthere is a point at which an employee's concerns and comments are\r\ntoo generalized and informal to constitute \"complaints\" that are\r\n\"filed\" with an employer within the meaning of the STAA.  The risk\r\nof inadequate notice to an employer that the employee has engaged\r\nin protected activity is greater when the alleged protected\r\ncomplaints are purely oral.  Here, however, we have no trouble\r\nconcluding that Dutkiewicz' oral and written complaints were\r\nsufficiently definite to put Clean Harbors on notice that he was\r\nengaging in protected activity.  The record makes it clear that\r\nDutkiewicz' superiors were well-aware of his fastidious compliance\r\nwith safety regulations and his oral and written refusals to\r\naccommodate this practice for the sake of customer satisfaction.  \r\nThe agency accepted Dutkiewicz' testimony that when\r\nCheyne and Ferrio repeatedly urged him to perform quicker pick-ups,\r\nhe complained to them that such action would result in regulatory\r\nviolations, and that he was obligated by law to make sure the\r\ncustomers' drums were DOT-shippable before he hauled them.  He\r\ncontinued to say this to Cheyne throughout the remainder of his\r\ninitial tenure at Clean Harbors.  Because Cheyne did not testify,\r\nDutkiewicz' testimony that he repeatedly complained to Cheyne was\r\nunrefuted.  The ALJ credited Dutkiewicz' testimony, and found that\r\nDutkiewicz did have a genuine, reasonable belief on many occasions\r\nthat drums tendered to him for shipment did not comply with DOT\r\nregulations.  The ARB accepted the ALJ's credibility\r\ndeterminations, and agreed with this finding.  Dutkiewicz'\r\ntestimony is further supported by the drum inspection forms which\r\nhe contemporaneously created and filled out to protect himself from\r\naccusations of wasting time.\r\nAside from the oral complaints and the drum inspection\r\nforms, Dutkiewicz wrote two letters to his superiors complaining\r\nthat he felt pressured to engage in regulatory violations.  The\r\nfirst such letter was written on March 5, 1994, to the president of\r\nClean Harbors, Alan McKim.  In the letter Dutkiewicz asserts that\r\nwhen a \"bad drum\" is accepted, \"Clean Harbors and everybody else\r\nconnected with the drum owns all the problems that go with it. \r\nThor didn't know if it was a [Dutkiewicz] problem or a customer\r\nproblem. . . .  So I designed a form for myself to show all\r\nconcered what the drums were like when I arrived on site, were the\r\nproblems solved, and were any [drums] refused.\"\r\nThe second letter was written the day after Dutkiewicz\r\nreceived Cheyne's demand that Dutkiewicz \"get in and out of [the\r\ncustomer's premises] . . . regardless of the condition of the\r\ndrums.\"  Dutkiewicz responded with a letter to Cheyne and Ferrio,\r\nin which he specifically complained that on his last trip the drums\r\nwere not prepared for shipment:   there was \"visible waste on three\r\ndrums, three drums didn't have any poison control labels on them,\r\nand two drums had lid rings upside down.\"  The letter reminded\r\nCheyne and Ferrio that:\r\nThe DOT is not very forgiving if I get stopped\r\nbecause of one of my drums is leaking. . . .\r\nNot only will I get in trouble, its [sic]\r\nagainst the law. . . . I have a lot of ground\r\nto cover in a course of a day.  I don't have\r\ntime to waste on purpose at a customers . . .\r\n. And as long as customers have improper\r\ndrums, I will have to spend time making them\r\nright. \r\nThe facts here show Clean Harbors was put on notice and\r\nDutkiewicz \"filed\" a complaint.\r\n2.  Causation\r\nClean Harbors' second major factual argument is that even\r\nif Dutkiewicz did engage in protected activity and \"filed\" a\r\ncomplaint, he was fired for the legitimate reason that he was\r\nangering customers.  The record reveals substantial evidence for\r\nthe ARB's finding that Dutkiewicz was terminated at least in part\r\nbecause of his protected activity, and that Clean Harbors failed to\r\nprove that it would have terminated Dutkiewicz had he not engaged\r\nin protected activity.  \r\nIt was reasonable to conclude the following from the\r\nevidence.  Cheyne and Ferrio pressured Dutkiewicz to speed up his\r\ncustomer pick-ups.  Dutkiewicz refused orally and in writing to\r\nsubmit to this pressure -- pressure that he reasonably believed\r\namounted to a demand to violate the law.  As customers continued to\r\ncomplain about Dutkiewicz' on-site delay, the customer service\r\nstaff became increasingly frustrated with Dutkiewicz' refusal to\r\nexpedite his pick-ups.  Ferrio pressured Cheyne to replace or\r\ntransfer Dutkiewicz.  Despite the fact that Cheyne had twice given\r\nDutkiewicz a favorable performance appraisal, Cheyne complied with\r\nFerrio's request and fired Dutkiewicz.  Thus, Clean Harbors\r\ninitially fired Dutkiewicz at least in part because he objected on\r\nsafety grounds to the demands that he perform faster pick-ups.  \r\nClean Harbors failed to prove that it would have fired\r\nDutkiewicz had he not complained about regulatory violations and\r\nrefused to expedite his on-site drum preparations.  At the hearing,\r\nClean Harbors failed to call Cheyne as a witness and failed to call\r\nany of the complaining customers as witnesses.  Instead, Clean\r\nHarbors chose to rely on the testimony of the customer service\r\nmanager about the customer complaints.  The ARB found that, in the\r\nabsence of any customer testimony, there was no basis to conclude\r\nthat customer complaints unrelated to Dutkiewicz' enforcement of\r\nthe STAA would have been sufficient to otherwise justify the\r\ntermination of Dutkiewicz' employment.  A company may reasonably\r\nchoose not to impose on its customers to appear as witnesses at\r\ntrial about complaints they have made, but it does so at its own\r\nrisk where the customer complaints may give the appearance of being\r\nbased on the employee's refusal to violate the law.  \r\nIt may be, as Clean Harbors so vociferously argues now,\r\nthat Dutkiewicz was rude to customers and that rudeness, and not\r\nDutkiewicz' obduracy about non-conforming drums, was what motivated\r\nthe complaints.  But the agency was not required to believe the\r\naccounts of the customer complaints from the customer service\r\nmanager.  This is particularly so where neither Cheyne nor Ferrio\r\never accompanied Dutkiewicz on a customer pick-up in order to\r\nconfirm or dispel Dutkiewicz' allegations that the customers were\r\nnot properly preparing their shipments.  They were apparently less\r\nconcerned with the accuracy of Dutkiewicz' allegations than with\r\nthe satisfaction of their customers.  \r\nThus, there is sufficient support for the conclusion that\r\nthe initial termination of Dutkiewicz' employment was in violation\r\nof the law.\r\nThroughout, the company's brief argues that it was not\r\nlogical for the company to do what Dutkiewicz claims it did.  This\r\nis too simple a view and, in any event, a misapprehension of the\r\nstandard of review.  People do things which may strike others as\r\nillogical; notions of what is in an actor's self interest may look\r\ndifferent to an outside observer than to the actor.  A company may\r\nhave many actors and their individual perceived interests, e.g.\r\nsatisfaction of a complaining customer, may differ from what is\r\nultimately in the company's interest, e.g. avoidance of a lawsuit\r\nfor retaliatory discharge.  This has been referred to as the theory\r\nof \"agency costs,\" where seemingly irrational behavior on the part\r\nof a corporation may be explained by the divergence of objectives\r\nbetween a corporation and its employees.  See Cambridge Plating\r\nCo., Inc. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 756 (1st Cir. 1996);\r\nAMPAT/Midwest, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., 896 F.2d 1035,\r\n1043 (7th Cir. 1990).  Further, as Justice Holmes famously said,\r\nthe life of the law has not been logic, but experience.  The\r\nstandard of review is not whether the findings by the agency\r\ncomport with a company acting logically, but whether there is\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the agency's findings. \r\nBut Dutkiewicz was reinstated, so we shift our focus to\r\nthe second termination.  This is a closer issue.  Clean Harbors'\r\narticulated reasons for terminating Dutkiewicz the second time were\r\nthat he had twice bucked the chain of command, and once had made a\r\ncomplaint about Clean Harbors to the Massachusetts Department of\r\nEnvironmental Protection.  Specifically, Brian Monahan testified\r\nthat:  (1) Dutkiewicz made an unauthorized call to Brian House, the\r\nVice President of Field Services, and left a lengthy voice mail\r\ncriticizing a new waste-tracking procedure for use by the company\r\ndrivers, thereby violating the agreed-upon chain of command; (2)\r\nDutkiewicz called Joseph Lentini, computer installation manager, to\r\nrequest a cellular phone for his truck, again violating the chain\r\nof command; and (3) Dutkiewicz contacted the Massachusetts\r\nDepartment of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\") in bad faith to\r\ncomplain that Clean Harbors was not using proper vehicle\r\nidentification decals for trucks going to Massachusetts.\r\nThe ARB found that the third reason was itself violative\r\nof the STAA: \r\nHere, even though Dutkiewicz received an\r\nacceptable response from Clean Harbors\r\nemployees -- that he should drive a different\r\ntruck rather than the one that lacked a\r\nvehicle identification card -- he still had\r\nthe right to speak with DEP concerning a\r\nsafety issue within that agency's purview.  We\r\nfind therefore that one of the articulated\r\nreasons for the second discharge directly\r\nviolated the STAA. \r\n\nARB Dec. at 7.  As for Dutkiewicz' failure to adhere to the agreed-\r\nupon chain of command, the ARB \"agree[d] with the ALJ that the\r\nreasons for the first discharge tainted the potentially\r\n'legitimate' reasons articulated for the second discharge.\"  Id. \r\nThe ARB then concluded that \"Clean Harbors did not show that it\r\nwould have discharged Dutkiewicz the second time if he had never\r\nengaged in any protected activities during his employment with the\r\ncompany.\"  Id.\r\nSubstantial evidence supports the ARB's findings.  Under\r\nthe STAA, Clean Harbors may not fire Dutkiewicz for raising a\r\nreasonable safety-related concern with a government agency, here\r\nthe Massachusetts DEP.  The evidence supports the ARB's implicit\r\ndetermination that Dutkiewicz' concern regarding proper vehicle\r\nidentification was reasonable.  And it is also clear from the\r\nrecord that upon his reinstatement, Dutkiewicz, unlike other\r\nemployees, was required to adhere to a rigid chain of command\r\nprecisely because of Clean Harbors' previous frustration with\r\nDutkiewicz.  That frustration related to Dutkiewicz' protected\r\ncomplaints and strict adherence to safety regulations.  Clean\r\nHarbors argues that Monahan, Dutkiewicz' supervisor who fired\r\nDutkiewicz the second time, was a new Clean Harbors employee and\r\nhad no knowledge of the prior relationship between Clean Harbors\r\nand Dutkiewicz.  Clean Harbors asserts that Monahan had \"no axe to\r\ngrind\" as far as Dutkiewicz was concerned, and wanted Dutkiewicz to\r\nsucceed at Clean Harbors.  But Monahan himself testified he was\r\naware of some prior history and had read the consultant's report. \r\nThat report stated that Dutkiewicz felt his prior termination\r\nresulted from his raising safety concerns.\r\nWe also find it significant, as did the agency, that\r\nDutkiewicz received no oral or written warnings about any of the\r\nthree incidents which Clean Harbors says justified his discharge. \r\nThat is so although Clean Harbors had agreed to document\r\ndisciplinary violations.  The excuse that Clean Harbors gave for\r\nits failure to warn Dutkiewicz is that there was no time to give\r\nwarnings.  That excuse is weak, given that the \"violations\" of the\r\nchain of command hardly triggered emergencies.  We uphold the ARB's\r\nfinding that the second termination violated the STAA as based on\r\nsubstantial evidence.\r\nThe facts in this case do not compel a finding that\r\nDutkiewicz' firing was caused by rudeness and poor manners with\r\ncustomers, as Clean Harbors asserts is true.  Nor do the facts\r\ncompel a finding that Clean Harbors fired an employee for\r\ncomplaining about safety issues.  This is a close case and Clean\r\nHarbors failed to convince the agency that its motives were\r\nunrelated to Dutkiewicz' complaints about safety issues.  There is\r\nenough evidence to support the agency's determination and so it is\r\naffirmed.\r\nThe decision of the ARB is affirmed.  Costs awarded to\r\nboth the Secretary of Labor and Dutkiewicz.\n",

Thomas Dutkiewicz was fired by his\r\nemployer, Clean Harbors Environmental Services, Inc., after he\r\nrepeatedly complained he felt his supervisors were pressuring him\r\nto violate Department of Transportation (\"DOT\") regulations for\r\nhauling hazardous materials, and that he would not do that.  The\r\ncompany said he was fired because customers complained about his\r\nabrasive manner.  Dutkiewicz complained to the company that he had\r\nbeen unfairly and unlawfully terminated.  The company rehired\r\nDutkiewicz for a different position, kept him on a short leash, and\r\nfired him three months later.\r\nDutkiewicz filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of\r\nLabor under the employee protection provisions of the Safety\r\nTransportation Assistance Act of 1982 (\"STAA\"), 49 U.S.C.  31105,\r\nclaiming both his employment terminations were in retaliation for\r\nhis safety complaints and his refusal to violate federal\r\nregulations.  The Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), in a\r\nrecommended decision and order, found in favor of Dutkiewicz and\r\nawarded back pay, reinstatement, and compensatory damages.  The\r\nAdministrative Review Board (\"ARB\") affirmed the ALJ's\r\nrecommendation and also upheld the damages award.  Clean Harbors\r\npetitions for review to this court, raising one pure issue of law\r\nand arguments that the ARB decision is not supported by substantial\r\nevidence.\r\nWhen an employee has \"filed a complaint or begun a\r\nproceeding,\" the STAA, 49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(A), protects that\r\nemployee from retaliatory adverse employment actions.  The question\r\nof law, one of first impression in this court, is whether this\r\nsection protects an employee who has filed purely intracorporate\r\ncomplaints about alleged violations of federal law.  We agree with\r\nthe ARB's interpretation that it does.  We also find that\r\nsubstantial evidence supports the ARB's findings that Dutkiewicz in\r\nfact \"filed\" such internal complaints, and that his employment\r\nterminations were causally related to that protected activity.\r\n                          I.\r\nA.  Factual Background\r\nClean Harbors is an environmental services company based\r\nin Braintree, Massachusetts.  Its services include treating,\r\nstoring, hauling, and disposing of hazardous waste.  Dutkiewicz\r\nbegan working for Clean Harbors as a truck driver in August of\r\n1993, out of the company's service center in New Britain,\r\nConnecticut.  Dutkiewicz' primary duty was to haul hazardous waste\r\nbetween the customers' facilities and Clean Harbors' treatment\r\nplant in Bristol, Connecticut.  This job required Dutkiewicz to\r\ninspect the waste containers for compliance with the law, to\r\ninventory, and to load the waste containers onto his truck before\r\nhauling them.  All of these activities are governed by DOT and\r\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") regulations.  If customers\r\ndo not properly prepare their drums of waste for shipment, the\r\ndriver must spend time at the customers' facilities bringing the\r\ndrums into compliance with the regulations.\r\nWhen Dutkiewicz began working for Clean Harbors he\r\nreceived training on compliance with DOT regulations.  Dutkiewicz\r\nalso studied the regulations on his own, and had prior work\r\nexperience in hauling hazardous materials.  No one seriously\r\nquestioned Dutkiewicz' familiarity with the various regulations\r\nthat governed his work activities.\r\nThor Cheyne was the general manager of the New Britain\r\nservice center during Dutkiewicz' initial tenure with Clean\r\nHarbors.  Dutkiewicz reported to Cheyne, as well as to Dave Mills,\r\nwho was Dutkiewicz' job coordinator.  Peter Ferrio and Peter Doyle\r\nwere customer account managers who dealt with the customers to whom\r\nDutkiewicz was assigned.  No single individual at the New Britain\r\nfacility was specifically assigned the task of ensuring compliance\r\nwith the environmental and safety regulations; instead, each\r\ndriver was individually responsible for ensuring regulatory\r\ncompliance on his own jobs.\r\nSoon after Dutkiewicz started working for Clean Harbors,\r\nthe company began charging customers for \"demurrage,\" or extra time\r\nthe drivers spent at the customers' facilities filling out\r\npaperwork and bringing the shipments into compliance for hauling. \r\nPreviously the customers were charged by the job, rather than by\r\nthe amount of time the driver took to complete the job.  After this\r\nnew charge was imposed, several large-account customers began\r\ncomplaining about Dutkiewicz.  According to the company, the\r\ncustomers complained that he was taking too much time at their\r\nfacilities, second-guessing their shipment preparation, and costing\r\nthem too much money.  In turn, several of the New Britain personnel\r\n-- Cheyne, Ferrio, and Doyle in particular -- pressured Dutkiewicz\r\nto stop \"wasting time\" on site.\r\nDutkiewicz responded to this pressure saying the\r\ncustomers who complained were the ones who had the most problems\r\nwith their shipments, and he took the extra time to bring their\r\ndrums of hazardous waste into compliance before loading them on to\r\nhis truck.  Dutkiewicz stressed that it was his obligation to\r\nensure regulatory compliance, that he personally could be put at\r\nrisk, and he would not violate the law and endanger himself and\r\nothers.\r\nAs the pressure to perform fast pick-ups continued,\r\nDutkiewicz became increasingly frustrated with what he believed\r\nwere demands to violate the law, and he decided to document the\r\nsituation.  In early January 1994, Dutkiewicz designed his own drum\r\ninspection form.  The form listed all of the regulatory\r\nrequirements and provided space for the driver to document whether\r\nthe customer had complied with the requirements or whether the\r\ndriver had to spend time fixing the shipments.  Dutkiewicz gave\r\ncopies to the customer service department and to Cheyne, and\r\nsubsequently used the forms to document each of his pick-ups. \r\nDutkiewicz hoped the forms would clarify why he was spending time\r\nat the customers' facilities and prove that he was not \"wasting\r\ntime.\"\r\nIn early February 1994, Dutkiewicz received a six-month\r\nperformance appraisal from Cheyne.  Dutkiewicz' overall performance\r\nwas said to \"meet expectations\" and he was given a raise.  In one\r\nof the \"comments\" sections, Cheyne wrote that \"Tom's thoroughness\r\nhas raised several questions with customers as to his productivity. \r\nTom should continue his quality in that it is quality that\r\ncustomers are buying from [Clean Harbors].\"\r\nIn early March, in response to continued pressure from\r\nCheyne and Ferrio to spend less time preparing drums, Dutkiewicz\r\nwrote a letter to Clean Harbors president Alan McKim.  The letter\r\nstated, inter alia:\r\n     I would like to address when a bad drum\r\nis accepted.  Clean Harbors and everybody else\r\nconnected with the drum owns all the problems\r\nthat go with it.  Thor [Cheyne] didn't know if\r\nit was a Tom [Dutkiewicz] problem or a\r\ncustomer problem . . . .  So I designed a form\r\nfor myself to show all concerned what the\r\ndrums were like when I arrived on site, were\r\nthe problems solved, and were any [drums]\r\nrefused [by the driver].\r\n     Now when a customer ask [sic] why they\r\nwere charged for extra time, Thor has\r\ndocumentation on what I did to correct the\r\nproblem that a customer should have done to\r\nmake them DOT shippable.  I've included a copy\r\nof this form for your review.      \r\nSometime in mid-March, Cheyne and Ferrio scolded\r\nDutkiewicz for taking too much time at the facility of one company,\r\na major Clean Harbors account.  Dutkiewicz gave his usual response,\r\nand invited Cheyne to accompany him on his next run to the company\r\nto see for himself that the drums were not in compliance.  Cheyne\r\nturned down the offer.\r\nOn April 18, 1994, Cheyne wrote Dutkiewicz this note:\r\nTom, I would like you to get in and out of\r\n[the customer's premises] w/o demurrage or\r\nextra time regardless of condition of drums. \r\nThor\r\nT.T. [Talk To] me if you have any questions.\r\nThe note was attached to a memorandum from John Shomsky -- a\r\ncustomer service representative -- which stated that the customer\r\nhad complained about Dutkiewicz wasting time on site.  Dutkiewicz\r\nunderstood the note to be a direction from his supervisor to accept\r\nand haul drums even if the drums did not comply with DOT\r\nregulations.  \r\nThe Cheyne note became the smoking gun in this dispute. \r\nClean Harbors argues that this note was in fact a direction to\r\nleave behind any non-compliant drums, not a direction to haul them. \r\nBut the ALJ and the ARB rejected that interpretation of the note\r\nfor several reasons.  Cheyne himself did not testify, and a Clean\r\nHarbors employee testified that the note could plausibly be read as\r\nDutkiewicz read it.  The evidence adequately supports the agency's\r\ninterpretation of the note.  \r\nDutkiewicz responded to the note by writing a letter to\r\nCheyne and Shomsky, dated April 19, 1994, stating:\r\n     First I would like to address the last\r\npickup from [the customer].  From the time I\r\narrived until Irene came down 20 minutes\r\npassed.  She had visible waste on three drums,\r\nthree drums didn't have any poison or\r\ncorrosive label on them, and two drums had lid\r\nrings up side [sic] down.  She has problems\r\nmaking her drums shippable.\r\n     The DOT is not very forgiving if I get\r\nstopped because of [sic] one of my drums is\r\nleaking.  No driver in this company will\r\naccept a drum that is not DOT shippable just\r\nto make the customer happy.  Not only will I\r\nget in trouble, its [sic] against the law.\r\n. . . .\r\n     The problems relating to customers\r\ncomplaining didn't start until the customer\r\nwas charged for time spent on site to correct\r\ndrums. And the ones that complained were the\r\nones that have trouble making their drums\r\nshippable.  \r\n     Believe me when I say it, I have a lot\r\nof ground to cover in a course of a day.  I\r\ndon't have time to waste on purpose at a\r\ncustomers [sic] just to make more hours. \r\nThere is no such saying, there is a faster way\r\nof making a drums [sic] shippable.  And as\r\nlong as people like Irene . . . have improper\r\ndrums, I will have to spend time making them\r\nright.  Irene is not in transportation, what\r\nshe thinks is shippable may very well be not\r\nshippable according to the DOT.  That's my\r\njob, is to determine what is or what isn't\r\nshippable.\r\n. . . . \r\n     In conclusion, . . . I refused [sic] to\r\nbe blamed for this or other shippers [who are\r\nunable] to properly label, mark, and secure\r\ndrums.  Yes, the customer is always right, up\r\nto a point.  No one should be abused by\r\ncustomers or be put at risk because of a\r\ncustomer.  There are a lot of clients out\r\nthere who really don't care.\r\n     . . . If you think I'm wrong in my\r\nwhole assessment, please feel free to call\r\nTony Cellucci or Kent Bongarzone [compliance\r\ndepartment supervisors] and we can discuss\r\nthis matter in further detail.\r\nThe record reveals no effort on the part of Cheyne or Ferrio to\r\ncontact the compliance department, or to determine whether or not\r\nDutkiewicz was correct that the customers were not properly\r\npreparing their hazardous materials for shipment.\r\nDutkiewicz also showed the Cheyne note to Dave Cyr, the\r\nClean Harbors operations manager at the Bristol, Connecticut\r\nfacility, and to Brian Peterson, the general manager of the\r\nBristol facility.  Dutkiewicz testified that he \"told Dave Cyr [he]\r\nwas concerned about protecting [him]self in the future,\" and that\r\nhe \"also wanted to alert them that Thor Cheyne was instructing\r\nClean Harbors' personnel to engage in practices contrary to EPA and\r\nDOT regulations.\"\r\nOn September 1, 1994, Cheyne gave Dutkiewicz his second\r\nperformance review.  He rated Dutkiewicz' overall performance as\r\n\"meets expectations,\" and gave Dutkiewicz a raise.  \r\nTwo weeks later, Ferrio sent a memorandum to Cheyne\r\nstating that Ferrio had received more complaints about Dutkiewicz. \r\nFerrio suggested that Cheyne either replace Dutkiewicz or find\r\nanother job for him in which there was no customer contact.  Later\r\nthat same day Ferrio wrote another note to Cheyne indicating that\r\nif Cheyne failed to take proper action Ferrio would \"go over\r\n[Cheyne's] head.\"  Three days later, September 19, 1994, Cheyne did\r\nas Ferrio asked and fired Dutkiewicz.  He told Dutkiewicz that\r\ncustomers were upset because he was wasting too much time fixing\r\ndrums.\r\nDutkiewicz immediately phoned and wrote Steven Pozner,\r\nthe company vice president for compliance, health and safety. \r\nDutkiewicz complained that his discharge resulted from Cheyne's\r\nlack of understanding of the DOT regulations, Cheyne's immediate\r\nimpulse to side with the customers and customer service managers,\r\nand Dutkiewicz' refusal to cut corners.  Dutkiewicz requested that\r\nthe corporate office investigate his discharge and reinstate him.\r\nThe company initially upheld the termination.  When\r\nDutkiewicz' wife phoned Tony Celluci, director of transportation\r\ncompliance, and threatened to report the termination to the federal\r\ngovernment and the media, the company offered Dutkiewicz three\r\nweeks of paid leave and agreed to investigate the termination\r\nfurther.  Clean Harbors hired a consultant, who ultimately\r\nsuggested that Dutkiewicz could be reinstated, albeit with strict\r\nsupervision and under a rigid chain of command. \r\nIn late October, 1994, Clean Harbors reinstated\r\nDutkiewicz as a driver based at the Bristol facility.  His new job\r\nwas to haul waste between the company's own facilities, rather than\r\nfrom customers' facilities.  The new job offer was conditioned on\r\nDutkiewicz' acceptance of a strict chain of command:  Dutkiewicz\r\nwas to direct any questions or comments only to John Caron, the\r\nBristol Transportation Coordinator, or to Brian Monahan, the\r\nBristol Director of Logistics.  When Dutkiewicz started work, he\r\nmet with Caron and Monahan who informed Dutkiewicz that he was \"on\r\na short leash.\"\r\nDutkiewicz testified that over the next few months he\r\nnoticed a number of DOT regulations violations, and reported them\r\nto his supervisors and corporate compliance personnel.  Monahan\r\nterminated Dutkiewicz on January 16, 1995, stating simply that\r\nthings were not working out and Dutkiewicz and Clean Harbors were\r\na bad match.\r\nB.  Procedural Background\r\nAfter he was fired the second time, Dutkiewicz filed a\r\ntimely complaint with the Department of Labor (\"DOL\"), claiming\r\nClean Harbors terminated him (twice) in violation of the employee\r\nprotection provision of the STAA.  That provision reads:\r\n(a) Prohibitions. (1) A person may not\r\ndischarge an employee regarding pay, terms, or\r\nprivileges of employment, because --\r\n     (A) the employee, or another person at\r\nthe employee's request, has filed a complaint\r\nor begun a proceeding related to a violation\r\nof a commercial motor vehicle safety\r\nregulation, standard, or order, or has\r\ntestified or will testify in such a\r\nproceeding; or\r\n     (B) the employee refuses to operate a\r\nvehicle because --\r\n          (i) the operation violates a\r\nregulation, standard, or order of the United\r\nStates related to commercial motor vehicle\r\nsafety or health; or\r\n          (ii) the employee has a reasonable\r\napprehension of serious injury to the employee\r\nor the public because of the vehicle's unsafe\r\ncondition.\r\n\n49 U.S.C.  31105(a).  After investigation, the OSHA Regional\r\nAdministrator (acting pursuant to DOL regulations) found that\r\nDutkiewicz' claim was unsupported, and dismissed the complaint. \r\nDutkiewicz objected to the findings and had a hearing before an\r\nALJ.\r\nThe ALJ, who credited Dutkiewicz' testimony, found that\r\nDutkiewicz had engaged in protected activity under both  31105\r\n(a)(1)(A) and (B), and that both of his employment terminations\r\nwere related to these protected activities.  As for  (a)(1)(A),\r\nthe ALJ found that, before the first of his employment\r\nterminations, Dutkiewicz continuously complained to Cheyne that he\r\nwas pressured by the customer service personnel and by Cheyne to\r\nviolate DOT regulations.  The ALJ also found that, \"with respect to\r\nrefusal to operate a vehicle [ (a)(1)(B)], complainant has\r\npresented evidence by his own testimony, supported by his\r\ncontemporaneously prepared drum inspection forms, that he\r\ncontinuously refused to drive Clean Harbors vehicles containing\r\nhazardous materials that he believed violated DOT regulations.\" \r\nThe ALJ agreed that customer complaints could be a valid reason for\r\ndischarging an employee, but found that Clean Harbors fired\r\nDutkiewicz because he refused to compromise his fastidious\r\ncompliance with the regulations, thereby angering customers and\r\njeopardizing accounts.  The ALJ also found that the second firing\r\nwas inextricably linked to the first unlawful dismissal.  The ALJ\r\nconcluded that Clean Harbors had violated the STAA, and ordered\r\ndamages and reinstatement for Dutkiewicz.  \r\nThe ARB found that the ALJ's \"findings of fact . . . are\r\nsupported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole and\r\ntherefore are conclusive.\"  See 29 C.F.R.  1978.109(c)(3).  It\r\nalso adopted the ALJ's assessments of witness credibility.  The ARB\r\nthen affirmed the ALJ's decision to order damages and\r\nreinstatement, but it did so based solely on the fact that\r\nDutkiewicz' termination was related to his protected activity of\r\n\"fil[ing] a complaint.\"\r\n                         II.\r\nWe review the ARB's final decision in accordance with the\r\ndictates of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.  701 et\r\nseq.  The ARB's decision must be affirmed unless its legal\r\nconclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or otherwise not in\r\naccordance with law, or its factual conclusions are unsupported by\r\nsubstantial evidence.  See 5 U.S.C.  706(2); Castle Coal &amp; Oil Co.v. Reich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696251\"><a href=\"/opinion/696251/castle-coal-oil-company-inc-v-robert-b-reich-secretary-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44 (2d Cir. 1995).\r\nA.  Statutory Interpretation\r\nDutkiewicz filed no complaints with a court or government\r\nagency before his first employment termination.  Thus, the ARB's\r\ndetermination that Dutkiewicz engaged in protected activity depends\r\nentirely upon a reading of  31105(a)(1)(A) to cover complaints\r\nwhich are purely internal to the employer.  This interpretation of\r\n\"filed a complaint or begun a proceeding\" raises an issue of law.\r\nCiting its own precedent, the ARB found that \"[a]n\r\nemployee's internal complaint to superiors conveying his reasonable\r\nbelief that the company was engaging in a violation of a motor\r\nvehicle safety regulation is a protected activity under [\r\n31105(a)(1)(A)].\"  Dutkiewicz v. Clean Harbors Envtl. Servs., Case\r\nNo. 97-STA-090, Sec. Dec. and Ord., Aug. 8, 1997, slip op. at 3-4\r\n(\"ARB Dec.\") (citing Stiles v. J.B. Hunt Transp., Inc., Case No.\r\n92-STA-34, Sec. Dec. and Ord., Sept 24, 1993, slip op. at 3-4).\r\nClean Harbors argues that the ARB's interpretation of the\r\nSTAA is in contravention of that statute's plain meaning, and that\r\n\"this ['filed a complaint or begun a proceeding'] language clearly\r\nconnotes the initiation of a formal administrative or court\r\nproceeding and not merely internal complaints.\"  Clean Harbors\r\ncontrasts this STAA language with the anti-retaliation provisions\r\nof other statutes, most notably, Title VII, which provides:\r\nIt shall be an unlawful employment practice\r\nfor an employer to discriminate against any of\r\nhis employees . . . because he has opposed any\r\npractice made an unlawful employment practice\r\nby this subchapter, or because he has made a\r\ncharge, testified, assisted, or participated\r\nin any manner in an investigation, proceeding,\r\nor hearing under this subchapter.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.  2000e-3.  According to Clean Harbors, because Congress\r\ncould have used this language in the STAA -- language which clearly\r\nprotects an employee who makes internal complaints -- it must have\r\nintended the narrower language it ultimately did use not to protect\r\nan employee who makes purely internal complaints.\r\nWe reject the company's interpretation that the STAA\r\nanti-retaliation protection is available only to employees who file\r\ncomplaints with a government agency or a court.  We do so for four\r\nreasons.  First, the language is susceptible to more than one\r\nreading.  Second, the Congress hewed to this language when it\r\nreenacted the STAA in 1994, in the face of long-standing\r\nadministrative interpretation of the STAA and similar language in\r\nother statutes to encompass internal complaints made to an\r\nemployer.  Third, in the absence of unambiguous statutory language,\r\nthis strikes us as the sort of interstitial law making which\r\nCongress left to the agency, under Chevron v. Natural Resources\r\nDefense Council, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 843-44 (1984).  Fourth, the policy\r\nchoice made by the agency is eminently reasonable.  It is\r\nreasonable in terms of leveraging the government's limited\r\nenforcement resources.\r\nThe STAA was originally enacted in 1983.  The employee\r\nprotection provision, like other whistleblower statutes, was\r\nintended to create a climate in which employees would feel free to\r\nvoice their health and safety concerns without fear of employer\r\nretaliation.  See Brock v. Roadway Express, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111868\"><a href=\"/opinion/111868/brock-v-roadway-express-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257\r\n(1987) (\"Section [31105] was enacted in 1983 to encourage employee\r\nreporting of noncompliance with safety regulations governing\r\ncommercial motor vehicles.\").  \r\nThe STAA was recodified and reenacted in 1994, expressly\r\nwithout substantive change. See Revision of Title 49,\r\nTransportation, United States Code, Pub. L. 103-272,  1, 108 Stat.\r\n745, 990-91 (1994).  In the years between 1983 and 1994, the\r\nSecretary of Labor and two courts of appeals interpreted the\r\nemployee protection language to encompass purely internal\r\ncomplaints.  See Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. v. Reich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656577\"><a href=\"/opinion/656577/yellow-freight-systems-incorporated-v-robert-b-reich-secretary-of-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n986 (4th Cir. 1993) (oral complaints to supervisor \"are protected\r\nactivity under the STAA\"); Moon v.

See Lorillard v. Pons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109777\"><a href=\"/opinion/109777/lorillard-v-pons/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580\r\n(1978) (\"Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or\r\njudicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that\r\ninterpretation when it reenacts a statute without change.\").  If\r\nCongress wanted to restrict the protected activity in \r\n31105(a)(1)(A) to filing complaints with the courts or agencies, it\r\nwould have done so when it recodified the law.\r\nWe also find persuasive the Secretary of Labor's argument\r\nthat interpreting \"filed a complaint\" to encompass only filings\r\nwith a court or government agency would create a redundancy in the\r\nstatute.  The STAA protects employees who have \"filed a complaint\"\r\nor \"begun a proceeding.\"  49 U.S.C.  31105(a)(1)(A).  A court or\r\nagency filing itself \"beg[ins] a proceeding,\" and the \"file a\r\ncomplaint\" language would thus be superfluous on Clean Harbors'\r\nreading of the statute.  See Bailey v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n146 (1995) (\"We assume that Congress used two terms because it\r\nintended each term to have a particular, nonsuperfluous meaning.\"). \r\nMoreover, the ARB's interpretation is reasonable.  First,\r\nit is supported by the obvious policy of encouraging corporate\r\ncompliance with such laws by casting a broad net in the anti-\r\nretaliation provisions.  As the Supreme Court has noted in\r\ninterpreting an analogous whistleblower statute, \"it needs no\r\nargument to show that fear of economic retaliation might often\r\noperate to induce aggrieved employees to accept substandard\r\nconditions.\"  Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105984\"><a href=\"/opinion/105984/mitchell-v-robert-demario-jewelry-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 292 (1960) (interpreting employee protection provision in\r\nFLSA).  A construction of the STAA that covers only complaints\r\nfiled with courts or government agencies would narrow the\r\nmechanisms to achieve these policy goals, leaving unprotected\r\nemployees who in good faith assert safety concerns to their\r\nemployers, or who indicate an unwillingness to engage in such\r\nviolations.  See Passaic Valley, 992 F.2d at 478 (\"Section 507(a)'s\r\nprotection would be largely hollow if it were restricted to the\r\npoint of filing a formal complaint with the appropriate external\r\nlaw enforcement agency.\"). \r\nInterpreting  31105(a)(1)(A) to protect only employees\r\nwho file external complaints would result in an anomalous and\r\ninefficient system.  The effect of the system urged by Clean\r\nHarbors would be to force employees with safety concerns to go\r\nstraight to the government.  A company's opportunity to remedy its\r\nown problems voluntarily and quietly would be lost.  Cf. id. at\r\n478-79.  Thus, the DOL's interpretation in many ways helps\r\ncompanies.  There is the contrary argument that companies will\r\nbenefit economically by reducing the number of employee complaints\r\nby making employees go to greater efforts to file a complaint with\r\nthe government.  That some employees (unhappy with company\r\npractices) may choose silence over going directly to the government\r\nmay indeed permit a company to skate by the requirements of the law\r\nfor a period, and (perhaps) temporarily benefit economically.  But\r\nthe penalties for noncompliance are high, and unhappy employees are\r\nlikely to help the government make its case once the government\r\ndoes become involved.  It is reasonable to conclude that the ARB's\r\nposition is fairer and less wasteful of resources for both the\r\ncorporate community and the government than the position offered by\r\nClean Harbors.\r\nClean Harbors does make one very telling argument:  that\r\nits interpretation of the statute provides clean and simple\r\nguidance on what a \"complaint\" is and the agency's interpretation\r\nunhelpfully leaves employers in the dark.  What sort of internal\r\ncomplaint is \"filing a complaint\" for purposes of the Act?  We\r\nthink the problem, while real, is not sufficient to invalidate the\r\nagency's interpretation, and may be dealt with as a matter of\r\nfactual analysis.\r\nThe ARB's construction of the STAA is plainly a\r\nreasonable and permissible one.\r\nB.  Substantial Evidence\r\nClean Harbors protests that there is not substantial\r\nevidence that what Dutkiewicz did amounted to filing a complaint or\r\nthat this activity is why Clean Harbors terminated his employment. \r\nSubstantial evidence is \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable\r\nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" \r\nRichardson v. Perales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108333\"><a href=\"/opinion/108333/richardson-v-perales/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 401 (1971) (citation and\r\nquotation marks omitted).  \r\nA prima facie case of unlawful termination under the STAA\r\nrequires a showing that the employee engaged in protected activity,\r\nthat the employee was subjected to adverse employment action, and\r\nthat there was a causal connection between the protected activity\r\nand the adverse action.  See Moon, 836 F.2d at 229.  Clean Harbors\r\ntook adverse employment action against Dutkiewicz, but contests\r\nthat Dutkiewicz engaged in any protected activity, and that there\r\nwas a causal link between any protected activity and the adverse\r\nemployment action.\r\nThe familiar burden-shifting analysis employed under\r\nTitle VII has also been employed under the STAA.  Where a\r\ncomplainant has made out a prima facie case of retaliatory\r\ndischarge, the employer may rebut that showing with evidence of a\r\nlegitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the discharge.  The burden\r\nthen shifts back to the complainant to prove that the proffered\r\nreason is pretext for unlawful retaliation.  See id. (adapting\r\nframework set forth in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973), to a STAA claim).  Where evidence of a dual motive\r\nexists, i.e., where there are legitimate reasons for a discharge in\r\naddition to the unlawful reasons, the employer bears the burden of\r\nestablishing by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have\r\ntaken the adverse employment action in the absence of the\r\nemployee's protected activity.  Cf. Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 242 (1989).  Both parties have accepted this as the\r\nstandard and we do not reexamine it.\r\n1.  \"Filing\" a Complaint\r\nThe facts of record support the ARB's determination that\r\nthe activity in which Dutkiewicz engaged met the requirements for\r\n\"filing a complaint.\"  There is no problem of lack of fair notice\r\non this record and we affirm that there was substantial evidence\r\nthat Dutkiewicz \"filed a complaint.\"\r\nWe recognize Clean Harbors' legitimate due process\r\nconcerns that the internal communications to the employer must be\r\nsufficient to give notice that a complaint is being filed and thus\r\nthat the activity is protected.  In the absence of such notice, the\r\nbeneficial purposes of the act cannot be accomplished.  Clearly\r\nthere is a point at which an employee's concerns and comments are\r\ntoo generalized and informal to constitute \"complaints\" that are\r\n\"filed\" with an employer within the meaning of the STAA.  The risk\r\nof inadequate notice to an employer that the employee has engaged\r\nin protected activity is greater when the alleged protected\r\ncomplaints are purely oral.  Here, however, we have no trouble\r\nconcluding that Dutkiewicz' oral and written complaints were\r\nsufficiently definite to put Clean Harbors on notice that he was\r\nengaging in protected activity.  The record makes it clear that\r\nDutkiewicz' superiors were well-aware of his fastidious compliance\r\nwith safety regulations and his oral and written refusals to\r\naccommodate this practice for the sake of customer satisfaction.  \r\nThe agency accepted Dutkiewicz' testimony that when\r\nCheyne and Ferrio repeatedly urged him to perform quicker pick-ups,\r\nhe complained to them that such action would result in regulatory\r\nviolations, and that he was obligated by law to make sure the\r\ncustomers' drums were DOT-shippable before he hauled them.  He\r\ncontinued to say this to Cheyne throughout the remainder of his\r\ninitial tenure at Clean Harbors.  Because Cheyne did not testify,\r\nDutkiewicz' testimony that he repeatedly complained to Cheyne was\r\nunrefuted.  The ALJ credited Dutkiewicz' testimony, and found that\r\nDutkiewicz did have a genuine, reasonable belief on many occasions\r\nthat drums tendered to him for shipment did not comply with DOT\r\nregulations.  The ARB accepted the ALJ's credibility\r\ndeterminations, and agreed with this finding.  Dutkiewicz'\r\ntestimony is further supported by the drum inspection forms which\r\nhe contemporaneously created and filled out to protect himself from\r\naccusations of wasting time.\r\nAside from the oral complaints and the drum inspection\r\nforms, Dutkiewicz wrote two letters to his superiors complaining\r\nthat he felt pressured to engage in regulatory violations.  The\r\nfirst such letter was written on March 5, 1994, to the president of\r\nClean Harbors, Alan McKim.  In the letter Dutkiewicz asserts that\r\nwhen a \"bad drum\" is accepted, \"Clean Harbors and everybody else\r\nconnected with the drum owns all the problems that go with it. \r\nThor didn't know if it was a [Dutkiewicz] problem or a customer\r\nproblem. . . .  So I designed a form for myself to show all\r\nconcered what the drums were like when I arrived on site, were the\r\nproblems solved, and were any [drums] refused.\"\r\nThe second letter was written the day after Dutkiewicz\r\nreceived Cheyne's demand that Dutkiewicz \"get in and out of [the\r\ncustomer's premises] . . . regardless of the condition of the\r\ndrums.\"  Dutkiewicz responded with a letter to Cheyne and Ferrio,\r\nin which he specifically complained that on his last trip the drums\r\nwere not prepared for shipment:   there was \"visible waste on three\r\ndrums, three drums didn't have any poison control labels on them,\r\nand two drums had lid rings upside down.\"  The letter reminded\r\nCheyne and Ferrio that:\r\nThe DOT is not very forgiving if I get stopped\r\nbecause of one of my drums is leaking. . . .\r\nNot only will I get in trouble, its [sic]\r\nagainst the law. . . . I have a lot of ground\r\nto cover in a course of a day.  I don't have\r\ntime to waste on purpose at a customers . . .\r\n. And as long as customers have improper\r\ndrums, I will have to spend time making them\r\nright. \r\nThe facts here show Clean Harbors was put on notice and\r\nDutkiewicz \"filed\" a complaint.\r\n2.  Causation\r\nClean Harbors' second major factual argument is that even\r\nif Dutkiewicz did engage in protected activity and \"filed\" a\r\ncomplaint, he was fired for the legitimate reason that he was\r\nangering customers.  The record reveals substantial evidence for\r\nthe ARB's finding that Dutkiewicz was terminated at least in part\r\nbecause of his protected activity, and that Clean Harbors failed to\r\nprove that it would have terminated Dutkiewicz had he not engaged\r\nin protected activity.  \r\nIt was reasonable to conclude the following from the\r\nevidence.  Cheyne and Ferrio pressured Dutkiewicz to speed up his\r\ncustomer pick-ups.  Dutkiewicz refused orally and in writing to\r\nsubmit to this pressure -- pressure that he reasonably believed\r\namounted to a demand to violate the law.  As customers continued to\r\ncomplain about Dutkiewicz' on-site delay, the customer service\r\nstaff became increasingly frustrated with Dutkiewicz' refusal to\r\nexpedite his pick-ups.  Ferrio pressured Cheyne to replace or\r\ntransfer Dutkiewicz.  Despite the fact that Cheyne had twice given\r\nDutkiewicz a favorable performance appraisal, Cheyne complied with\r\nFerrio's request and fired Dutkiewicz.  Thus, Clean Harbors\r\ninitially fired Dutkiewicz at least in part because he objected on\r\nsafety grounds to the demands that he perform faster pick-ups.  \r\nClean Harbors failed to prove that it would have fired\r\nDutkiewicz had he not complained about regulatory violations and\r\nrefused to expedite his on-site drum preparations.  At the hearing,\r\nClean Harbors failed to call Cheyne as a witness and failed to call\r\nany of the complaining customers as witnesses.  Instead, Clean\r\nHarbors chose to rely on the testimony of the customer service\r\nmanager about the customer complaints.  The ARB found that, in the\r\nabsence of any customer testimony, there was no basis to conclude\r\nthat customer complaints unrelated to Dutkiewicz' enforcement of\r\nthe STAA would have been sufficient to otherwise justify the\r\ntermination of Dutkiewicz' employment.  A company may reasonably\r\nchoose not to impose on its customers to appear as witnesses at\r\ntrial about complaints they have made, but it does so at its own\r\nrisk where the customer complaints may give the appearance of being\r\nbased on the employee's refusal to violate the law.  \r\nIt may be, as Clean Harbors so vociferously argues now,\r\nthat Dutkiewicz was rude to customers and that rudeness, and not\r\nDutkiewicz' obduracy about non-conforming drums, was what motivated\r\nthe complaints.  But the agency was not required to believe the\r\naccounts of the customer complaints from the customer service\r\nmanager.  This is particularly so where neither Cheyne nor Ferrio\r\never accompanied Dutkiewicz on a customer pick-up in order to\r\nconfirm or dispel Dutkiewicz' allegations that the customers were\r\nnot properly preparing their shipments.  They were apparently less\r\nconcerned with the accuracy of Dutkiewicz' allegations than with\r\nthe satisfaction of their customers.  \r\nThus, there is sufficient support for the conclusion that\r\nthe initial termination of Dutkiewicz' employment was in violation\r\nof the law.\r\nThroughout, the company's brief argues that it was not\r\nlogical for the company to do what Dutkiewicz claims it did.  This\r\nis too simple a view and, in any event, a misapprehension of the\r\nstandard of review.  People do things which may strike others as\r\nillogical; notions of what is in an actor's self interest may look\r\ndifferent to an outside observer than to the actor.  A company may\r\nhave many actors and their individual perceived interests, e.g.\r\nsatisfaction of a complaining customer, may differ from what is\r\nultimately in the company's interest, e.g. avoidance of a lawsuit\r\nfor retaliatory discharge.  This has been referred to as the theory\r\nof \"agency costs,\" where seemingly irrational behavior on the part\r\nof a corporation may be explained by the divergence of objectives\r\nbetween a corporation and its employees.  See Cambridge Plating\r\nCo., Inc. v. Napco, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196794\"><a href=\"/opinion/196794/cambridge-plating-v-napco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 756 (1st Cir. 1996);\r\nAMPAT/Midwest, Inc. v. Illinois Tool Works, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537033\"><a href=\"/opinion/537033/ampatmidwest-inc-cross-appellee-v-illinois-tool-works-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1035</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n1043 (7th Cir. 1990).  Further, as Justice Holmes famously said,\r\nthe life of the law has not been logic, but experience.  The\r\nstandard of review is not whether the findings by the agency\r\ncomport with a company acting logically, but whether there is\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the agency's findings. \r\nBut Dutkiewicz was reinstated, so we shift our focus to\r\nthe second termination.  This is a closer issue.  Clean Harbors'\r\narticulated reasons for terminating Dutkiewicz the second time were\r\nthat he had twice bucked the chain of command, and once had made a\r\ncomplaint about Clean Harbors to the Massachusetts Department of\r\nEnvironmental Protection.  Specifically, Brian Monahan testified\r\nthat:  (1) Dutkiewicz made an unauthorized call to Brian House, the\r\nVice President of Field Services, and left a lengthy voice mail\r\ncriticizing a new waste-tracking procedure for use by the company\r\ndrivers, thereby violating the agreed-upon chain of command; (2)\r\nDutkiewicz called Joseph Lentini, computer installation manager, to\r\nrequest a cellular phone for his truck, again violating the chain\r\nof command; and (3) Dutkiewicz contacted the Massachusetts\r\nDepartment of Environmental Protection (\"DEP\") in bad faith to\r\ncomplain that Clean Harbors was not using proper vehicle\r\nidentification decals for trucks going to Massachusetts.\r\nThe ARB found that the third reason was itself violative\r\nof the STAA: \r\nHere, even though Dutkiewicz received an\r\nacceptable response from Clean Harbors\r\nemployees -- that he should drive a different\r\ntruck rather than the one that lacked a\r\nvehicle identification card -- he still had\r\nthe right to speak with DEP concerning a\r\nsafety issue within that agency's purview.  We\r\nfind therefore that one of the articulated\r\nreasons for the second discharge directly\r\nviolated the STAA. \r\n\nARB Dec. at 7.  As for Dutkiewicz' failure to adhere to the agreed-\r\nupon chain of command, the ARB \"agree[d] with the ALJ that the\r\nreasons for the first discharge tainted the potentially\r\n'legitimate' reasons articulated for the second discharge.\"  Id. \r\nThe ARB then concluded that \"Clean Harbors did not show that it\r\nwould have discharged Dutkiewicz the second time if he had never\r\nengaged in any protected activities during his employment with the\r\ncompany.\"  Id.\r\nSubstantial evidence supports the ARB's findings.  Under\r\nthe STAA, Clean Harbors may not fire Dutkiewicz for raising a\r\nreasonable safety-related concern with a government agency, here\r\nthe Massachusetts DEP.  The evidence supports the ARB's implicit\r\ndetermination that Dutkiewicz' concern regarding proper vehicle\r\nidentification was reasonable.  And it is also clear from the\r\nrecord that upon his reinstatement, Dutkiewicz, unlike other\r\nemployees, was required to adhere to a rigid chain of command\r\nprecisely because of Clean Harbors' previous frustration with\r\nDutkiewicz.  That frustration related to Dutkiewicz' protected\r\ncomplaints and strict adherence to safety regulations.  Clean\r\nHarbors argues that Monahan, Dutkiewicz' supervisor who fired\r\nDutkiewicz the second time, was a new Clean Harbors employee and\r\nhad no knowledge of the prior relationship between Clean Harbors\r\nand Dutkiewicz.  Clean Harbors asserts that Monahan had \"no axe to\r\ngrind\" as far as Dutkiewicz was concerned, and wanted Dutkiewicz to\r\nsucceed at Clean Harbors.  But Monahan himself testified he was\r\naware of some prior history and had read the consultant's report. \r\nThat report stated that Dutkiewicz felt his prior termination\r\nresulted from his raising safety concerns.\r\nWe also find it significant, as did the agency, that\r\nDutkiewicz received no oral or written warnings about any of the\r\nthree incidents which Clean Harbors says justified his discharge. \r\nThat is so although Clean Harbors had agreed to document\r\ndisciplinary violations.  The excuse that Clean Harbors gave for\r\nits failure to warn Dutkiewicz is that there was no time to give\r\nwarnings.  That excuse is weak, given that the \"violations\" of the\r\nchain of command hardly triggered emergencies.  We uphold the ARB's\r\nfinding that the second termination violated the STAA as based on\r\nsubstantial evidence.\r\nThe facts in this case do not compel a finding that\r\nDutkiewicz' firing was caused by rudeness and poor manners with\r\ncustomers, as Clean Harbors asserts is true.  Nor do the facts\r\ncompel a finding that Clean Harbors fired an employee for\r\ncomplaining about safety issues.  This is a close case and Clean\r\nHarbors failed to convince the agency that its motives were\r\nunrelated to Dutkiewicz' complaints about safety issues.  There is\r\nenough evidence to support the agency's determination and so it is\r\naffirmed.\r\nThe decision of the ARB is affirmed.  Costs awarded to\r\nboth the Secretary of Labor and Dutkiewicz.\n</pre>",
