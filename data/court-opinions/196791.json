They appeal,  ably arguing  that the prosecutor  was\r\n\noverly   zealous,   the   evidence   insufficient   and   the\r\n\ninstructions deficient.  While the prosecutor  overstepped in\r\n\nasking  one  witness  to   comment  on  the  truthfulness  of\r\n\nanother's  testimony, the  misstep was  harmless error.   The\r\n\nprosecution presented  enough evidence to prove  its case and\r\n\nthe instructions contained no error.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I\r\n\n          Two  masked  men,  one  with a  sawed-off  shotgun,\r\n\nrobbed the  Inn in the early  morning of July 28,  1994.  The\r\n\nInn's night manager was  faced with the shotgun by a  man who\r\n\njumped  over the  countertop  and told  the  manager to  look\r\n\nstraight ahead and not at him.  Startled, the manager did not\r\n\nget a full look at the robber.  He did get a good enough look\r\n\nto testify that the robber was a man of medium build, between\r\n\n5'8\"  and 5'10\" high, weighing between 140 and 160 pounds and\r\n\nin  his early to mid-twenties.   The robber wore some sort of\r\n\nski  mask, or combination of  masks, and dark  clothing.  The\r\n\nmanager heard, but did not see, a second robber.  The robbers\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\ntook  the  manager's checkbook,  his  $160 in  cash,  and his\r\n\ngrocery store  and bank cards.  The robber with the gun asked\r\n\nthe manager where the Inn's money  was.  The manager told him\r\n\nit  was in  a drawer.   The  second robber  said that  he had\r\n\ngotten  the drawer open and the robbers took the $360 inside.\r\n\nThe robbers told the manager to  lie down on the floor.  They\r\n\ntaped his eyes and mouth shut with duct tape and fled.\r\n\n          Shortly thereafter, the  police stopped a car  with\r\n\nfour men but released them.   In the car were the  defendants\r\n\nand two companions, Dale Braley and Timothy Boudreau.  Braley\r\n\nand Boudreau eventually became cooperating witnesses.\r\n\n          Meanwhile  the investigation  proceeded.   A police\r\n\ndog  followed the  robbers' scent across  the field  around a\r\n\nbarn next  to an abandoned  house.   At the house  the police\r\n\nobserved tire tracks from a car that had rapidly accelerated.\r\n\nLater, a citizen observed  a maroon bag on a  nearby roadside\r\n\nand told the police about it.  The bag contained, among other\r\n\nthings,  a sawed-off  shotgun, a  locked box with  a shoulder\r\n\nholster  inside  of  it,  two  masks,  dark  sweatshirts  and\r\n\ncamouflage hats.  It also  contained the rest of the roll  of\r\n\nthe  duct  tape  used  to bind  the  manager,  the  manager's\r\n\ncheckbook and his bank cards.  The bag had a  tag bearing the\r\n\nname \"Angela Turner.\"  Ms. Turner, it turned out, was Platt's\r\n\ngirlfriend.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n          The scheme unravelled.   The police followed  leads\r\n\nto Braley  and Boudreau, who incriminated  Platt and Sullivan\r\n\nwhile minimizing their own  roles in the crime.   Hearing the\r\n\npolice  were looking  to  question them,  Platt and  Sullivan\r\n\ndisappeared.   But  when  arrest warrants  were issued,  they\r\n\nsurrendered.\r\n\n          Sullivan and Platt were  charged with conspiracy to\r\n\nobstruct commerce  by  robbery in  violation of  18 U.S.C.   \r\n\n1951,  obstructing  commerce  and  attempting  the   same  by\r\n\ncommitting robbery in violation  of 18 U.S.C.    1951  and 2,\r\n\nand using  or carrying a  firearm in  relation to a  crime of\r\n\nviolence, and aiding  and abetting the same,  in violation of\r\n\n18 U.S.C.     924(c)  and 2.   Platt and  Sullivan were  each\r\n\ncharged  individually  with  possession   of  a  firearm  not\r\n\nregistered to them in  the National Firearms Registration and\r\n\nTransfer  Record in  violation of  26 U.S.C.      5861(d) and\r\n\n5871.   They were  also each charged  individually with being\r\n\nfelons in possession of  firearms, in violation of 18  U.S.C.\r\n\n   922(g)(1),  924(a)(2) and 924(e)(1).   They were convicted\r\n\non  all  counts save  for  Sullivan's  acquittal  on the  two\r\n\nfirearm possession counts.\r\n\n          It was clear that the four men were connected  with\r\n\nthe  crime and two had  actually committed it.   The question\r\n\nwas  which two.   At  trial the  theory  of defense  was that\r\n\nBraley  and  Boudreau  had done  it  and  that  there was  no\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nreliable identification of the defendants.  While a footprint\r\n\nwas  found on the Inn manager's countertop, it did not appear\r\n\nto belong to either Sullivan or  Platt and the police did not\r\n\ndo the work to identify whose footprint it was.  \r\n\n          At trial,  Braley testified  that the foursome  had\r\n\ndecided to commit  a crime and went  riding around in a  car.\r\n\nBraley  and Boudreau both said  that Sullivan, who had worked\r\n\nas a pizza delivery person, mentioned that the Inn would have\r\n\nonly  one employee there  and would  be a  good target  for a\r\n\nrobbery.  Braley testified  that they drove to  the abandoned\r\n\nhouse  near the  Inn.   Sullivan and  Platt donned  masks and\r\n\ncamouflage gear  and walked  across a  field toward  the Inn.\r\n\nLater, Sullivan and Platt returned.  They \"dash[ed]\" into the\r\n\ncar and told Braley to get out of there because they had seen\r\n\na cop.   In the  car, Sullivan said,  \"I got that  guy good.\"\r\n\nWhile holding his finger up to  the back of Braley's head  as\r\n\nif he were pointing  a gun, Sullivan said he had  jumped over\r\n\nthe  motel counter and told the night manager to \"[g]et right\r\n\ndown on the ground.\"   After the group had driven about eight\r\n\nmiles,  they noticed  a police  car  coming toward  them and,\r\n\nafraid they might be  stopped, tossed the maroon bag  out the\r\n\nwindow.  \r\n\n          The  girlfriends of the  defendants implicated them\r\n\nin the  crimes, but attempted  to recant those  statements at\r\n\ntrial.    Braley  and  Boudreau acknowledged  they  had  been\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\ncharged  with involvement  with the  robbery in  state court.\r\n\nAnother  witness,  Vaughn  Stevenson,  testified  that  Platt\r\n\nwanted to purchase the  sawed-off shotgun and that Stevenson,\r\n\nwho acted as  middleman for the  transaction, got the  weapon\r\n\nfrom  the seller and put it into Platt's closet.  Stevenson's\r\n\nfriend, Danny Cray, also testified that Platt said  he wanted\r\n\nto purchase the  shotgun and that Stevenson had delivered the\r\n\nshotgun to the place where Platt was living.\r\n\n          Sullivan argues that  the evidence was insufficient\r\n\nto support his conviction  of using or carrying a  firearm in\r\n\nconnection with a crime of violence, particularly in light of\r\n\nhis  being  acquitted on  the  charges  of possession  of  an\r\n\nunregistered  firearm and  being a felon  in possession  of a\r\n\nfirearm.  Sullivan also  argues the instruction on reasonable\r\n\ndoubt was in  violation of  his due process  rights and  that\r\n\nseveral  prosecutorial  actions,  including the  prosecutor's\r\n\nasking  Sullivan  to  comment  on  the  veracity  of  another\r\n\nwitness's  testimony, violated  due process.   Finally, under\r\n\ndifferent  labels  he  attempts   to  mount  an   ineffective\r\n\nassistance of counsel claim.  \r\n\n          Platt  argues  that  the district  court  erred  in\r\n\npermitting the prosecutor to  question Sullivan as to whether\r\n\nthe  other witness  lied.   In  addition,  he argues  that  a\r\n\nstatement  made  by  the  prosecution  in  opening   argument\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\nviolated  his  Fifth Amendment  rights  and  that there  were\r\n\nevidentiary errors.  \r\n\n          We treat each defendant's claims separately.\r\n\n                              II\r\n\n                           Sullivan\r                                               \r\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\r                                       \r\n\n          In assessing a challenge  to the sufficiency of the\r\n\nevidence,  we \"review  the  record to  determine whether  the\r\n\nevidence and  reasonable  inferences therefrom,  taken  as  a\r\n\nwhole and in  the light  most favorable  to the  prosecution,\r\n\nwould  allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt that  the defendants were  guilty as charged.\"   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Mena-Robles,  4 F.3d 1026,  1031 (1st  Cir. 1993),\r                                  \r\n\ncert. denied, 114 S. Ct. 1550 (1994).\r                        \r\n\n          Sullivan's  assertion  that  there was  not  enough\r\n\nevidence  to show he carried or used the shotgun stresses two\r\n\npoints.   First, Sullivan says, it is undisputed that the gun\r\n\nbelonged to Platt and that the night manager did not see  who\r\n\ncarried  the gun.  He claims no  other evidence linked him to\r\n\nthe gun.  Second, he  says that the weakness of the  evidence\r\n\nis  revealed by the jury's acquitting him of being a felon in\r\n\npossession  of a  firearm and  of possessing  an unregistered\r\n\nweapon.  \r\n\n          As  to the  latter, \"'[v]erdict  inconsistency does\r\n\nnot indicate that the  government necessarily failed to prove\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nan essential element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.'\"\r\n\nUnited  States v.  Calderon, 77  F.3d 6,  10 (1st  Cir. 1996)\r                                       \r\n\n(quoting  United States v. Lopez,  944 F.2d 33,  41 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1991)); see also United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57 (1984).\r                                                    \r\n\nAn inconsistent verdict does  not require vacating a criminal\r\n\nconviction  as long as the appellate  court is satisfied that\r\n\nthere  was  sufficient  evidence  to sustain  the  counts  of\r\n\nconviction.  See Calderon, 77 F.3d at 10.\r                                     \r\n\n          A jury could well have found that Sullivan actually\r\n\ncarried or used the  gun himself or, at the  least, knowingly\r\n\naided or  abetted the carrying  or use  of the gun.   It  was\r\n\nclear  that at least one of the robbers carried the sawed-off\r\n\nshotgun.   The  night manager testified  that the  robber who\r\n\naccosted him  brandished a shotgun.   That robber  \"used\" the\r\n\nfirearm.  See  Bailey v. United  States, 116 S. Ct.  501, 508\r                                                   \r\n\n(1995).  A reasonable jury could have found that Sullivan was\r\n\nthat robber.  Braley testified that after the robbery, in the\r\n\ncar, Sullivan  put a pretend gun to Braley's head, apparently\r\n\nimitating what he had  done to the night manager.  And, there\r\n\nwas testimony that Sullivan, in advance of the robbery, while\r\n\nat  Platt's home,  picked up  the gun  and commented  that it\r\n\nwould be good to use in a robbery.  The  evidence showed that\r\n\nthe two  robbers walked across the  field to the Inn.   It is\r\n\nreasonable to  infer that the gun  was brought to  the Inn by\r\n\none  or both and that the two  robbers were each aware of the\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nshotgun  and its intended use.  A sawed-off shotgun is hardly\r\n\ninconspicuous.1   The gun  was brought back  from the robbery\r\n\nand put  in the bag  later abandoned by  the four men  in the\r\n\ncar.  In the bag were the masks and camouflage  garments also\r\n\nused in the  robbery.   The evidence was  sufficient to  show\r\n\nthat  Sullivan knew  the  shotgun would  be  used or  carried\r\n\nduring  the robbery and that he took some action intending to\r\n\ncause the  gun to be used  or carried.  See  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nLuciano-Mosquera,  63  F.3d  1142,  1150  (1st   Cir.  1995),\r                            \r\n\npetition for cert.  filed, 64  U.S.L.W. 3765  (U.S. Apr.  26,\r                                     \r\n\n1996) (No. 95-1775); see also United States v.

In this  instance\r                                   \r\n\nthe  standard of  review does  not alter the  outcome because\r\n\nthere was no error in the instruction.\r\n\n          The judge instructed the jury as follows:\r\n\n               Now, as I have indicated to you, the\r\n          government has the burden of  proving the\r\n          defendants  guilty  beyond  a  reasonable\r\n          doubt.   Some of  you may have  served as\r\n          jurors in  civil cases and when  you were\r\n          told that it  is only necessary  to prove\r\n          that a fact is  more likely true than not\r\n          true, in a civil case, that's the burden.\r\n          In criminal cases, the government's proof\r\n          is subject to a higher standard.  It must\r\n          be beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n               Now,     there's     been    several\r\n          suggestions made to you during the course\r\n          of  argument  with  regard to  reasonable\r\n          doubt.  And I  point out to you  that the\r\n          lawyers  have  the   right,  indeed   the\r\n          responsibility, to point out to you those\r\n          facts   or   that   evidence   or   those\r\n          interpretations of  legal principles that\r\n          is more persuasive  to their side  of the\r\n          case.  I instruct you that, if what I  am\r\n          telling you  about the law differs in any\r\n          way  with what the  lawyers have told you\r\n          about  the  law, I'm  instructing  you to\r\n          follow the  law as I  give it to  you and\r\n          not as the lawyers suggest[] it may be if\r\n          there is a difference.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\n               \"Reasonable  doubt\"   has  now  been\r\n          defined for you in several different ways\r\n          by  counsel,  and  I  instruct  you  that\r\n          reasonable  doubt  defines  itself  --  a\r\n          doubt that is reasonable.  It has a plain\r\n          meaning,  and you as  jurors can consider\r\n          the  plain  meaning  of reasonable  doubt\r\n          with what the words say.\r\n               The only  caveat  that you  must  be\r\n          clear about as  it relates to  reasonable\r\n          doubt is  that the government  must prove\r\n          the guilt  of each of  the defendants for\r\n          the crimes involved  beyond a  reasonable\r\n          doubt as you interpret that term.\r\n\nThe  judge  thus  left the  fine  tuning  of  the meaning  of\r\n\n\"reasonable doubt\" to the jurors, as is appropriate under our\r\n\nprecedent.   See United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1024\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).  \r\n\n          Sullivan says that by referring to  the definitions\r\n\ngiven   by   counsel,   the  judge   incorporated   erroneous\r\n\ndefinitions.  The argument suffers from  three flaws.  First,\r\n\nthat is not a fair reading of the instruction, which told the\r\n\njurors  what  the judge's  instructions  were.   Second,  the\r                                     \r\n\nreference to counsel's  definitions was followed  immediately\r\n\nby  a statement that the judge's instructions on the law were\r\n\nto  be followed,  and,  if there  were  differences, not  the\r\n\nlawyers'.   Third,  to  the extent  that Sullivan's  argument\r\n\nrests on the premise  that his own counsel gave  an erroneous\r\n\ndefinition of reasonable doubt, we will not entertain such an\r\n\nargument.  Cf.  United States  v. Munson, 819  F.2d 337,  342\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1987)  (no   plain  error  in  admitting  certain\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\ntestimony  when,  among  other  problems, the  testimony  was\r\n\nelicited by defense counsel on cross-examination).\r\n\nIneffective Assistance and Due Process Claims\r                                                         \r\n\n          Sullivan combines three arguments, tied together by\r\n\nthe common theme  that his counsel at  trial was ineffective.\r\n\nFor several  reasons, ineffective  assistance claims  are not\r\n\nusually heard on direct  appeal.  See United States  v. Diaz-\r                                                                         \r\n\nMartinez,  71 F.3d 946, 953 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nCollins,  60 F.3d  4, 7  n.1 (1st  Cir. 1995).   There  is no\r                   \r\n\nreason here to depart from that rule.  \r\n\n          To the  extent he  makes claims independent  of the\r\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel claim, they  fail on their\r\n\nown.   Sullivan  complains  that,  despite Platt's  objection\r\n\nwhich resulted in excluding the evidence, the evidence should\r\n\nhave been admitted that Platt and Braley committed  a robbery\r\n\nof the Econolodge  the week  before the robbery  of the  Inn.\r\n\nSullivan  urges that the  evidence would have  been useful to\r\n\nimpeach  Braley.    Failing  that,  he  says,  severance  was\r\n\nwarranted.  \r\n\n          His  initial  hurdle is  that  he  never sought  to\r\n\ncross-examine  Braley about  the  Econolodge  matter, and  he\r\n\nobjected  to  the   government's  request  to  present   such\r\n\nevidence.   Moreover,  he never  asked for  a severance.   At\r\n\nbest,  review of  his contentions is  for plain error.   In a\r\n\nstrange  twist, the  parties now  reverse the  positions they\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\nheld  in  the  trial court  with  the  government saying  the\r\n\nevidence was  cumulative and  Sullivan saying it  should have\r\n\nbeen  admitted.   Switching  of position  aside,  this was  a\r\n\nmatter  of discretion  for the trial  judge and  the decision\r\n\nhardly requires reversal  as plain error.   See United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

The rule reserves to the jury questions\r\n\nof credibility and thus makes it improper to induce a witness\r\n\nto say another witness lied on the stand.

The  question is whether  the\r\n\nviolation of the rule was harmless.  In context, it certainly\r\n\nwas.   While  evidence  of guilt  is  only one  factor to  be\r\n\nconsidered,  such evidence  was very  strong.

The  other witness\r\n\ntestified to Sullivan's complaint; Sullivan denied making it.\r\n\nThe damage to Sullivan's defense came from Stevenson's direct\r\n\ntestimony.    That there  was  a  contradiction between  that\r\n\ntestimony  and  Sullivan's was  obvious.    Pointing out  the\r\n\nobvious  most   likely  scored   the  government,   at  most,\r\n\nrhetorical points.    We cannot  say that  these few  largely\r\n\nrhetorical questions from the  prosecutor affected at all the\r\n\noutcome of the trial.   Cf. United States v.  Wihbey, 75 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n761, 771  (1st  Cir.  1996)  (improper  conduct  on  part  of\r\n\nprosecutor not  implicating a  constitutional right does  not\r\n\nrequire  reversal  unless  it  affected the  outcome  of  the\r\n\ntrial).\r\n\n          Sullivan also argues that some of the comments made\r\n\nby  the prosecution  in  its closing  argument were  improper\r\n\nvouching  for  the credibility  of  certain  witnesses.   The\r\n\nprosecutor argued:\r\n\n               The  government would  suggest that,\r\n          again,  Tim Boudreau,  if you  assess his\r\n          believability  on  the witness  stand, he\r\n          came off pretty believable.  But you have\r\n          to   make   that  judgment,   ladies  and\r\n          gentlemen.\r\n               . . .   The  government suggests  to\r\n          you  [Cray]  couldn't  have   lied  about\r\n          anything up  on  the witness  stand.   He\r\n          couldn't -- if he  was lying, he couldn't\r\n          even remember his own name.\r\n\nAnd on rebuttal, the prosecutor argued:\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                         -18-\r\r\n\n          The government suggests  . . . that  they\r\n          were up there telling the truth.\r\n          . . . .\r\n               .   .  .

Stevenson, and . . .\r\n          Boudreau .  . . are telling  the truth in\r\n          this case.\r\n\nAs there  was no objection,  we review for plain  error.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.

See Wihbey, 75 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\nat  771-73 (comment that  \"what they  have done  is testified\r\n\n. . .  truthfully   about  what  they   knew\"  was   improper\r\n\nvouching); United States  v. Manning, 23  F.3d 570, 572  (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1994) (improper  witness  vouching  for  prosecutor  to\r\n\nargue:  \"If  [police witness] is going to come  in and lie to\r\n\nyou he  could have done  that very, very  easily.   There's a\r\n\nmillion  little  ways  they  could   have  given  it  to  the\r\n\nDefendant.    But they  cannot.    The prosecution  witnesses\r\n\ncannot engage in that kind of conduct.  They're bound  by the\r\n\ntruth. . .  .   They're  bound by  their  oath and  limits of\r\n\nhonesty.\").  Nevertheless, no miscarriage of justice resulted\r\n\nand the comments  did not impact  the fairness, integrity  or\r\n\npublic reputation  of the judicial proceedings  and so should\r\n\nnot be noticed as plain error.  See Collins, 60 F.3d at 7.\r                                                       \r\n\n                             -19-\r                                         -19-\r\r\n\n                             III\r\n\n                            Platt\r                                             \r\n\nProsecutor's Opening Statements\r                                           \r\n\n          Platt  argues  that the  prosecutor's  statement in\r\n\nopening  that the jury would \"meet\" the two defendants was an\r\n\nimproper  comment on  whether the  defendants would  testify.\r\n\nSullivan  objected to  the  comment and  at  the end  of  the\r\n\nopening, Platt  moved  for a  mistrial.   The district  court\r\n\ndenied  the   motion,  but  offered  to   give  a  cautionary\r\n\ninstruction.      Apparently  for   strategic   reasons,  the\r\n\ndefendants rejected the offer.  \r\n\n          Whether  the  prosecutor's  argument  violated  the\r\n\nFifth  Amendment  privilege  against   self-incrimination  is\r\n\nreviewed de novo.   United States v. Hardy, 37  F.3d 753, 756\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1994).   We review  the denial  of the  motion for\r\n\nmistrial for abuse  of discretion.   See Wihbey,  75 F.3d  at\r                                                           \r\n\n773.  There was no violation of the Fifth Amendment here.  \r\n\n          \"A  prosecutor's comment  is improper  where, under\r\n\nthe  circumstances  of  the   case,  the  language  used  was\r\n\nmanifestly  intended or was  of such character  that the jury\r\n\nwould  naturally and necessarily take  it to be  a comment on\r\n\nthe failure  of the accused to  testify.\"  Hardy, 37  F.3d at\r                                                            \r\n\n757 (internal quotations omitted).  Sullivan's counsel agreed\r\n\nthat  the choice of words was not deliberate:  the prosecutor\r\n\nmeant to say that  the defendants would be introduced  to the\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                         -20-\r\r\n\njury.  And in fact, the defendants' lawyers did introduce the\r\n\ndefendants  to  the  jury   after  the  prosecutor  made  the\r\n\nallegedly  offending remark.    In context,  the prosecutor's\r\n\nword choice  did not  \"naturally and necessarily\"  comment on\r\n\nthe  defendants' privilege  against self-incrimination.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nHardy, 37 F.3d at 757-58 (holding that prosecutor's statement\r                 \r\n\nthat defendants, who  were sitting in  the courtroom but  did\r\n\nnot testify,  were \"still running and  hiding today\" violated\r\n\nthe Fifth  Amendment (emphasis removed)).  Thus, there was no\r\n\nprosecutorial  misconduct  that  would   warrant  considering\r\n\nmistrial.\r\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\r                                       \r\n\n          Platt  also makes  a  claim that  the evidence  was\r\n\ninsufficient to  support his  conviction.  Platt  argues that\r\n\nthe evidence implicating him  as one of the two  robbers came\r\n\nprincipally  from  Braley and  Boudreau.    Those two,  Platt\r\n\nargues,  should  not have  been  believed  because they  were\r\n\ncooperating witnesses who  gave inconsistent versions  of the\r\n\nevents  that   transpired  on   July  28,  1994.     However,\r\n\n\"'[c]redibility determinations are uniquely within the jury's\r\n\nprovince,  and we defer to the jury's verdict if the evidence\r\n\ncan support varying inferences.'\"  United States v. Calderon,\r                                                                        \r\n\n77 F.3d 6, 10  (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting Cruz-Kuilan,  75 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\nat 62).   As the recital of the facts  shows, there was ample\r\n\nevidence to convict Platt on all counts.\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                         -21-\r\r\n\nOther Evidentiary Issues\r                                    \r\n\n          Platt  argues  that  the  district  court erred  in\r\n\nexcluding the  prior misdemeanor and  juvenile convictions of\r\n\ncertain  government  witnesses and  that  the district  court\r\n\nabused  its  discretion  by  allowing   cross-examination  of\r\n\nSullivan  on a prior robbery conviction.   We have considered\r\n\nPlatt's arguments and find no abuse of discretion.5\r\n\n          Finally,  Platt argues that  evidence that Boudreau\r\n\nhad  no  prior  criminal  convictions should  not  have  been\r\n\nadmitted.  Platt  argues that  the evidence  was admitted  in\r\n\nviolation  of  Fed. R.  Evid.  608  to  show Boudreau's  good\r\n\ncharacter.   Cf. Government of  Virgin Islands v.  Grant, 775\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 508,  510-12 (3d Cir. 1985)  (such evidence inadmissible\r\n\nunder Rules 404 and 405 to  prove character of accused).  The\r\n\nrecord  shows  that  it   was  admitted  to  further  develop\r\n\nBoudreau's background  and it was thus  within the discretion\r\n\nof the district court.   Cf. United States v.  Blackwell, 853\r                                                                    \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Platt  seeks  a  stricter  standard  of  review  for  the\r\ndistrict  court's  exclusion  of  one  witness's  misdemeanor\r\nconviction for theft by arguing that it \"involved dishonesty\"\r\nand thus  should  have  been  admitted under  Fed.  R.  Evid.\r\n609(a).   See United States v.  Tracy, 36 F.3d 187,  192 (1st\r                                                 \r\nCir.  1994)  (district  court  does not  have  discretion  to\r\nexclude   prior   convictions   involving    dishonesty   for\r\nimpeachment  purposes),  cert.  denied, 115  S.

See id.; United States v.\r                                                                      \r\nMejia-Alarcon,  995  F.2d 982,  989  n.7  (10th Cir.),  cert.\r                                                                         \r\ndenied, 114  S.

Defendant Dennis Sullivan was sentenced for the crime to spend almost the next thirty years of his life in prison.   Defendant Thomas Platt was sentenced to more than thirty years.   They appeal, ably arguing that the prosecutor was overly zealous, the evidence insufficient and the instructions deficient.   While the prosecutor overstepped in asking one witness to comment on the truthfulness of another's testimony, the misstep was harmless error.   The prosecution presented enough evidence to prove its case and the instructions contained no error.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Two masked men, one with a sawed-off shotgun, robbed the Inn in the early morning of July 28, 1994.   The Inn's night manager was faced with the shotgun by a man who jumped over the countertop and told the manager to look straight ahead and not at him.   Startled, the manager did not get a full look at the robber.   He did get a good enough look to testify that the robber was a man of medium build, between 5'8\"' and 5'10\"' high, weighing between 140 and 160 pounds and in his early to mid-twenties.   The robber wore some sort of ski mask, or combination of masks, and dark clothing.   The manager heard, but did not see, a second robber.   The robbers took the manager's checkbook, his $160 in cash, and his grocery store and bank cards.   The robber with the gun asked the manager where the Inn's money was.   The manager told him it was in a drawer.   The second robber said that he had gotten the drawer open and the robbers took the $360 inside.   The robbers told the manager to lie down on the floor.   They taped his eyes and mouth shut with duct tape and fled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the police stopped a car with four men but released them.   In the car were the defendants and two companions, Dale Braley and Timothy Boudreau.   Braley and Boudreau eventually became cooperating witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile the investigation proceeded.   A police dog followed the robbers' scent across the field around a barn next to an abandoned house.   At the house the police observed tire tracks from a car that had rapidly accelerated.   Later, a citizen observed a maroon bag on a nearby roadside and told the police about it.   The bag contained, among other things, a sawed-off shotgun, a locked box with a shoulder holster inside of it, two masks, dark sweatshirts and camouflage hats.   It also contained the rest of the roll of the duct tape used to bind the manager, the manager's checkbook and his bank cards.   The bag had a tag bearing the name \"Angela Turner.\"   Ms. Turner, it turned out, was Platt's girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme unravelled.   The police followed leads to Braley and Boudreau, who incriminated Platt and Sullivan while minimizing their own roles in the crime.   Hearing the police were looking to question them, Platt and Sullivan disappeared.   But when arrest warrants were issued, they surrendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan and Platt were charged with conspiracy to obstruct commerce by robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951, obstructing commerce and attempting the same by committing robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1951 and 2, and using or carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and aiding and abetting the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c) and 2.  Platt and Sullivan were each charged individually with possession of a firearm not registered to them in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5861(d) and 5871.   They were also each charged individually with being felons in possession of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) and 924(e)(1).   They were convicted on all counts save for Sullivan's acquittal on the two firearm possession counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was clear that the four men were connected with the crime and two had actually committed it.   The question was which two.   At trial the theory of defense was that Braley and Boudreau had done it and that there was no reliable identification of the defendants.   While a footprint was found on the Inn manager's countertop, it did not appear to belong to either Sullivan or Platt and the police did not do the work to identify whose footprint it was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Braley testified that the foursome had decided to commit a crime and went riding around in a car.   Braley and Boudreau both said that Sullivan, who had worked as a pizza delivery person, mentioned that the Inn would have only one employee there and would be a good target for a robbery.   Braley testified that they drove to the abandoned house near the Inn.  Sullivan and Platt donned masks and camouflage gear and walked across a field toward the Inn.  Later, Sullivan and Platt returned.   They \"dash[ed]\" into the car and told Braley to get out of there because they had seen a cop.   In the car, Sullivan said, \"I got that guy good.\"   While holding his finger up to the back of Braley's head as if he were pointing a gun, Sullivan said he had jumped over the motel counter and told the night manager to \"[g]et right down on the ground.\"   After the group had driven about eight miles, they noticed a police car coming toward them and, afraid they might be stopped, tossed the maroon bag out the window.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The girlfriends of the defendants had implicated them in the crimes, but attempted to recant those statements at trial.   Braley and Boudreau acknowledged they had been charged with involvement with the robbery in state court.   Another witness, Vaughn Stevenson, testified that Platt wanted to purchase the sawed-off shotgun and that Stevenson, who acted as middleman for the transaction, got the weapon from the seller and put it into Platt's closet.   Stevenson's friend, Danny Cray, also testified that Platt said he wanted to purchase the shotgun and that Stevenson had delivered the shotgun to the place where Platt was living.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of using or carrying a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, particularly in light of his being acquitted on the charges of possession of an unregistered firearm and being a felon in possession of a firearm.   Sullivan also argues the instruction on reasonable doubt was in violation of his due process rights and that several prosecutorial actions, including the prosecutor's asking Sullivan to comment on the veracity of another witness's testimony, violated due process.   Finally, under different labels he attempts to mount an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Platt argues that the district court erred in permitting the prosecutor to question Sullivan as to whether the other witness lied.   In addition, he argues that a statement made by the prosecution in opening argument violated his Fifth Amendment rights and that there were evidentiary errors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We treat each defendant's claims separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Sullivan</p>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we \"review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty as charged.\"  United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1550, 128 L.Ed.2d 199 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan's assertion that there was not enough evidence to show he carried or used the shotgun stresses two points.   First, Sullivan says, it is undisputed that the gun belonged to Platt and that the night manager did not see who carried the gun.   He claims no other evidence linked him to the gun.   Second, he says that the weakness of the evidence is revealed by the jury's acquitting him of being a felon in possession of a firearm and of possessing an unregistered weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the latter, \" '[v]erdict inconsistency does not indicate that the government necessarily failed to prove an essential element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.' \"  United States v. Calderon, 77 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 41 (1st Cir.1991));  see also United States v. Powell, 469 U.S. 57, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461 (1984).   An inconsistent verdict does not require vacating a criminal conviction as long as the appellate court is satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the counts of conviction.   Calderon, 77 F.3d at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A jury could well have found that Sullivan actually carried or used the gun himself or, at the least, knowingly aided or abetted the carrying or use of the gun.   It was clear that at least one of the robbers carried the sawed-off shotgun.   The night manager testified that the robber who accosted him brandished a shotgun.   That robber \"used\" the firearm.   See Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 501, 508, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995).   A reasonable jury could have found that Sullivan was that robber.   Braley testified that after the robbery, in the car, Sullivan put a pretend gun to Braley's head, apparently imitating what he had done to the night manager.   And, there was testimony that Sullivan, in advance of the robbery, while at Platt's home, picked up the gun and commented that it would be good to use in a robbery.   The evidence showed that the two robbers walked across the field to the Inn.  It is reasonable to infer that the gun was brought to the Inn by one or both and that the two robbers were each aware of the shotgun and its intended use.   A sawed-off shotgun is hardly inconspicuous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The gun was brought back from the robbery and put in the bag later abandoned by the four men in the car.   In the bag were the masks and camouflage garments also used in the robbery.   The evidence was sufficient to show that Sullivan knew the shotgun would be used or carried during the robbery and that he took some action intending to cause the gun to be used or carried.   See United States v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1150 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1879, 135 L.Ed.2d 174 (1996);  see also United States v. Price, 76 F.3d 526, 529-30 (3d Cir.1996) (The \"[accomplice without the gun] probably knew in advance, and most certainly knew at the time, what [the one with the gun] was doing.\");  United States v. DeMasi, 40 F.3d 1306, 1316 (1st Cir.1994) (one can be held liable under aiding and abetting theory if he knew that weapons would be used during the robbery), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 947, 130 L.Ed.2d 890 (1995).   The jury could have found actual knowledge and thus could easily have found that Sullivan knew to a \"practical certainty\" that the gun would be used.   See United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 238 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Reasonable Doubt Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although he did not object to the reasonable doubt instruction at trial, Sullivan attempts to attack the instruction on appeal.   As a result, he must meet the strictures of plain error review.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b);  Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d at 1156.   In this instance the standard of review does not alter the outcome because there was no error in the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, as I have indicated to you, the government has the burden of proving the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.   Some of you may have served as jurors in civil cases and when you were told that it is only necessary to prove that a fact is more likely true than not true, in a civil case, that's the burden.   In criminal cases, the government's proof is subject to a higher standard.   It must be beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, there's been several suggestions made to you during the course of argument with regard to reasonable doubt.   And I point out to you that the lawyers have the right, indeed the responsibility, to point out to you those facts or that evidence or those interpretations of legal principles that is more persuasive to their side of the case.   I instruct you that, if what I am telling you about the law differs in any way with what the lawyers have told you about the law, I'm instructing you to follow the law as I give it to you and not as the lawyers suggest[ ] it may be if there is a difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Reasonable doubt\" has now been defined for you in several different ways by counsel, and I instruct you that reasonable doubt defines itself--a doubt that is reasonable.   It has a plain meaning, and you as jurors can consider the plain meaning of reasonable doubt with what the words say.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only caveat that you must be clear about as it relates to reasonable doubt is that the government must prove the guilt of each of the defendants for the crimes involved beyond a reasonable doubt as you interpret that term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge thus left the fine tuning of the meaning of \"reasonable doubt\" to the jurors, as is appropriate under our precedent.   See United States v. Cassiere, 4 F.3d 1006, 1024 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan says that by referring to the definitions given by counsel, the judge incorporated erroneous definitions.   The argument suffers from three flaws.   First, that is not a fair reading of the instruction, which told the jurors what the judge's instructions were.   Second, the reference to counsel's definitions was followed immediately by a statement that the judge's instructions on the law were to be followed, and, if there were differences, not the lawyers'.   Third, to the extent that Sullivan's argument rests on the premise that his own counsel gave an erroneous definition of reasonable doubt, we will not entertain such an argument.   Cf. United States v. Munson, 819 F.2d 337, 342 (1st Cir.1987) (no plain error in admitting certain testimony when, among other problems, the testimony was elicited by defense counsel on cross-examination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>Ineffective Assistance and Due Process Claims</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan combines three arguments, tied together by the common theme that his counsel at trial was ineffective.   For several reasons, ineffective assistance claims are not usually heard on direct appeal.   See United States v. Diaz-Martinez, 71 F.3d 946, 953 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Collins, 60 F.3d 4, 7 n. 1 (1st Cir.1995).   There is no reason here to depart from that rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent he makes claims independent of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, they fail on their own.   Sullivan complains that, despite Platt's objection which resulted in excluding the evidence, the evidence should have been admitted that Platt and Braley committed a robbery of the Econolodge the week before the robbery of the Inn.  Sullivan urges that the evidence would have been useful to impeach Braley.   Failing that, he says, severance was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His initial hurdle is that he never sought to cross-examine Braley about the Econolodge matter and he objected to the government's request to present such evidence.   Moreover, he never asked for a severance.   At best, review of his contentions is for plain error.   In a strange twist, the parties now reverse the positions they held in the trial court with the government saying the evidence was cumulative and Sullivan saying it should have been admitted.   Switching of position aside, this was a matter of discretion for the trial judge and the decision hardly requires reversal as plain error.   See United States v. Innamorati, 996 F.2d 456, 478 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 409, 126 L.Ed.2d 356 (1993).   The same is true for the alleged error in failing to sever the trials.   Cf. United States v. Edgar, 82 F.3d 499 (1st Cir.1996) (failure to sever reviewed for abuse of discretion);  United States v. Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 158 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 1331, 127 L.Ed.2d 678 (1994) (same).   There was strong evidence of guilt in this case.   Sullivan's convictions do not rise to a \"miscarriage of justice.\"   See Edgar, 82 F.3d at 510 n. 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan's second argument of trial error is also raised by Platt.   Through a series of questions, reproduced in the margin,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the prosecutor asked Sullivan whether another witness, Vaughn Stevenson, had lied when the witness said that Sullivan had complained that he wished he didn't have so many people involved in the robbery.   This court stated in United States v. Akitoye, 923 F.2d 221, 224 (1st Cir.1991), that this type of questioning was improper.   Other courts have said the same.   See United States v. Boyd, 54 F.3d 868, 871 (D.C.Cir.1995);  United States v. Scanio, 900 F.2d 485, 492-93 (2d Cir.1990), overruled on other grounds, Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135, 114 S.Ct. 655, 126 L.Ed.2d 615 (1994).   If there was any ambiguity left after Akitoye, we state the rule now emphatically:  counsel should not ask one witness to comment on the veracity of the testimony of another witness.   As was explained in Akitoye:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>It is not the place of one witness to draw conclusions about, or cast aspersions upon another witness' veracity.   The \"was-the-witness-lying\" question framed by the prosecutor in this case was of that stripe.   It should never have been posed....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">923 F.2d at 224 (citations omitted).   We expect that the office of the United States Attorney<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and other counsel will abide by the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution next misreads a line of cases primarily from the Second Circuit and suggests that this non-comment rule applies differently depending on whether the other witness is a police officer or a lay witness.   Compare Boyd, 54 F.3d at 871 (\"It is ... error for a prosecutor to induce a witness to testify that another witness, and in particular a government agent, has lied on the stand.\") and United States v. Richter, 826 F.2d 206, 208 (2d Cir.1987) (\"Prosecutorial cross-examination which compels a defendant to state that law enforcement officers lied in their testimony is improper.\") with United States v. Gaind, 31 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir.1994) (\"[T]he opposing witnesses in this case were former [employees of defendant's business], not government agents.\") and Scanio, 900 F.2d at 493 (\"While the rule barring this type of cross-examination is not limited to situations where the defendant is asked to comment on the testimony of government agents, ... we have shown special concern with prosecutors utilizing what some persons perceive as the heightened credibility of government agents ....\" (internal citations omitted)).   The rule only applies, the prosecution says, when the other witness is a police witness, not a lay witness.   We make no such distinction, nor does the Second Circuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  That erroneous reading misunderstands the purpose of the rule.   The rule reserves to the jury questions of credibility and thus makes it improper to induce a witness to say another witness lied on the stand.   See Boyd, 54 F.3d at 871.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That this rule was violated by the prosecution is not the end of the analysis.   The question is whether the violation of the rule was harmless.   In context, it certainly was.   While evidence of guilt is only one factor to be considered, such evidence was very strong.   See generally Harry T. Edwards, To Err Is Human, But Not Always Harmless:  When Should Legal Error Be Tolerated?, 70 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1167 (1995).   Two witnesses testified that Platt and Sullivan committed the robbery and four witnesses tied Platt to the shotgun.   Moreover, the error was on a minor point:  whether Sullivan in his testimony would say another witness was lying when the witness said Sullivan had complained about too many people being involved in the robbery.   The other witness testified to Sullivan's complaint;  Sullivan denied making it.   The damage to Sullivan's defense came from Stevenson's direct testimony.   That there was a contradiction between that testimony and Sullivan's was obvious.   Pointing out the obvious most likely scored the government, at most, rhetorical points.   We cannot say that these few largely rhetorical questions from the prosecutor affected at all the outcome of the trial.   Cf. United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 771 (1st Cir.1996) (improper conduct on part of prosecutor not implicating a constitutional right does not require reversal unless it affected the outcome of the trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also argues that some of the comments made by the prosecution in its closing argument were improper vouching for the credibility of certain witnesses.   The prosecutor argued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government would suggest that, again, Tim Boudreau, if you assess his believability on the witness stand, he came off pretty believable.   But you have to make that judgment, ladies and gentlemen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... The government suggests to you [Cray] couldn't have lied about anything up on the witness stand.   He couldn't--if he was lying, he couldn't even remember his own name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">And on rebuttal, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>The government suggests ... that they were up there telling the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...

The government suggests that ... Braley, ... Stevenson, and ... Boudreau ... are telling the truth in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As there was no objection, we review for plain error.   See United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While some of the statements may have been an appropriate response to the defendants' attack on the government witnesses' credibility, see id., others may have crossed the line into improper vouching.   See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 771-73 (comment that \"what they have done is testified ... truthfully about what they knew\" was improper vouching);  United States v. Manning, 23 F.3d 570, 572 (1st Cir.1994) (improper witness vouching for prosecutor to argue:  \"If [police witness] is going to come in and lie to you he could have done that very, very easily.   There's a million little ways they could have given it to the Defendant.   But they cannot.   The prosecution witnesses cannot engage in that kind of conduct.   They're bound by the truth....  They're bound by their oath and limits of honesty.\").   Nevertheless, no miscarriage of justice resulted and the comments did not impact the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings and so should not be noticed as plain error.   See Collins, 60 F.3d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Platt</p>\n    <p>Prosecutor's Opening Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Platt argues that the prosecutor's statement in opening that the jury would \"meet\" the two defendants was an improper comment on whether the defendants would testify.   Sullivan objected to the comment and at the end of the opening, Platt moved for a mistrial.   The district court denied the motion, but offered to give a cautionary instruction.   Apparently for strategic reasons, the defendants rejected the offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the prosecutor's argument violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is reviewed de novo.  United States v. Hardy, 37 F.3d 753, 756 (1st Cir.1994).   We review the denial of the motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion.   See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 773.   There was no violation of the Fifth Amendment here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A prosecutor's comment is improper where, under the circumstances of the case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\"  Hardy, 37 F.3d at 757 (internal quotations omitted).   Sullivan's counsel agreed that the choice of words was not deliberate:  the prosecutor meant to say that the defendants would be introduced to the jury.   And in fact, the defendants' lawyers did introduce the defendants to the jury after the prosecutor made the allegedly offending remark.   In context, the prosecutor's word choice did not \"naturally and necessarily\" comment on the defendants' privilege against self-incrimination.   Cf. Hardy, 37 F.3d at 757-58 (holding that prosecutor's statement that defendants, who were sitting in the courtroom but did not testify, were \"still running and hiding today\" violated the Fifth Amendment (emphasis removed)).   Thus, there was no prosecutorial misconduct that would warrant considering mistrial.Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Platt also makes a claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.   Platt argues that the evidence implicating him as one of the two robbers came principally from Braley and Boudreau.   Those two, Platt argues, should not have been believed because they were cooperating witnesses who gave inconsistent versions of the events that transpired on July 28, 1994.   However, \" '[c]redibility determinations are uniquely within the jury's province, and we defer to the jury's verdict if the evidence can support varying inferences.' \"  United States v. Calderon, 77 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d at 62).   As the recital of the facts shows, there was ample evidence to convict Platt on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Other Evidentiary Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Platt argues that the district court erred in excluding the prior misdemeanor and juvenile convictions of certain government witnesses and that the district court abused its discretion by allowing cross-examination of Sullivan on a prior robbery conviction.   We have considered Platt's arguments and find no abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Platt argues that evidence that Boudreau had no prior criminal convictions should not have been admitted.   Platt argues that the evidence was admitted in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 608 to show Boudreau's good character.   Cf. Government of Virgin Islands v. Grant, 775 F.2d 508, 510-12 (3d Cir.1985) (such evidence inadmissible under Rules 404 and 405 to prove character of accused).   The record shows that it was admitted to further develop Boudreau's background and it was thus within the discretion of the district court.   Cf. United States v.

Defendant Dennis Sullivan was sentenced for the crime to spend almost the next thirty years of his life in prison.   Defendant Thomas Platt was sentenced to more than thirty years.   They appeal, ably arguing that the prosecutor was overly zealous, the evidence insufficient and the instructions deficient.   While the prosecutor overstepped in asking one witness to comment on the truthfulness of another's testimony, the misstep was harmless error.   The prosecution presented enough evidence to prove its case and the instructions contained no error.   We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Two masked men, one with a sawed-off shotgun, robbed the Inn in the early morning of July 28, 1994.   The Inn's night manager was faced with the shotgun by a man who jumped over the countertop and told the manager to look straight ahead and not at him.   Startled, the manager did not get a full look at the robber.   He did get a good enough look to testify that the robber was a man of medium build, between 5'8\"' and 5'10\"' high, weighing between 140 and 160 pounds and in his early to mid-twenties.   The robber wore some sort of ski mask, or combination of masks, and dark clothing.   The manager heard, but did not see, a second robber.   The robbers took the manager's checkbook, his $160 in cash, and his grocery store and bank cards.   The robber with the gun asked the manager where the Inn's money was.   The manager told him it was in a drawer.   The second robber said that he had gotten the drawer open and the robbers took the $360 inside.   The robbers told the manager to lie down on the floor.   They taped his eyes and mouth shut with duct tape and fled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, the police stopped a car with four men but released them.   In the car were the defendants and two companions, Dale Braley and Timothy Boudreau.   Braley and Boudreau eventually became cooperating witnesses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile the investigation proceeded.   A police dog followed the robbers' scent across the field around a barn next to an abandoned house.   At the house the police observed tire tracks from a car that had rapidly accelerated.   Later, a citizen observed a maroon bag on a nearby roadside and told the police about it.   The bag contained, among other things, a sawed-off shotgun, a locked box with a shoulder holster inside of it, two masks, dark sweatshirts and camouflage hats.   It also contained the rest of the roll of the duct tape used to bind the manager, the manager's checkbook and his bank cards.   The bag had a tag bearing the name \"Angela Turner.\"   Ms. Turner, it turned out, was Platt's girlfriend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scheme unravelled.   The police followed leads to Braley and Boudreau, who incriminated Platt and Sullivan while minimizing their own roles in the crime.   Hearing the police were looking to question them, Platt and Sullivan disappeared.   But when arrest warrants were issued, they surrendered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan and Platt were charged with conspiracy to obstruct commerce by robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1951, obstructing commerce and attempting the same by committing robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1951 and 2, and using or carrying a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, and aiding and abetting the same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(c) and 2.  Platt and Sullivan were each charged individually with possession of a firearm not registered to them in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5861(d) and 5871.   They were also each charged individually with being felons in possession of firearms, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2) and 924(e)(1).   They were convicted on all counts save for Sullivan's acquittal on the two firearm possession counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was clear that the four men were connected with the crime and two had actually committed it.   The question was which two.   At trial the theory of defense was that Braley and Boudreau had done it and that there was no reliable identification of the defendants.   While a footprint was found on the Inn manager's countertop, it did not appear to belong to either Sullivan or Platt and the police did not do the work to identify whose footprint it was.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Braley testified that the foursome had decided to commit a crime and went riding around in a car.   Braley and Boudreau both said that Sullivan, who had worked as a pizza delivery person, mentioned that the Inn would have only one employee there and would be a good target for a robbery.   Braley testified that they drove to the abandoned house near the Inn.  Sullivan and Platt donned masks and camouflage gear and walked across a field toward the Inn.  Later, Sullivan and Platt returned.   They \"dash[ed]\" into the car and told Braley to get out of there because they had seen a cop.   In the car, Sullivan said, \"I got that guy good.\"   While holding his finger up to the back of Braley's head as if he were pointing a gun, Sullivan said he had jumped over the motel counter and told the night manager to \"[g]et right down on the ground.\"   After the group had driven about eight miles, they noticed a police car coming toward them and, afraid they might be stopped, tossed the maroon bag out the window.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The girlfriends of the defendants had implicated them in the crimes, but attempted to recant those statements at trial.   Braley and Boudreau acknowledged they had been charged with involvement with the robbery in state court.   Another witness, Vaughn Stevenson, testified that Platt wanted to purchase the sawed-off shotgun and that Stevenson, who acted as middleman for the transaction, got the weapon from the seller and put it into Platt's closet.   Stevenson's friend, Danny Cray, also testified that Platt said he wanted to purchase the shotgun and that Stevenson had delivered the shotgun to the place where Platt was living.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan argues that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction of using or carrying a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, particularly in light of his being acquitted on the charges of possession of an unregistered firearm and being a felon in possession of a firearm.   Sullivan also argues the instruction on reasonable doubt was in violation of his due process rights and that several prosecutorial actions, including the prosecutor's asking Sullivan to comment on the veracity of another witness's testimony, violated due process.   Finally, under different labels he attempts to mount an ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Platt argues that the district court erred in permitting the prosecutor to question Sullivan as to whether the other witness lied.   In addition, he argues that a statement made by the prosecution in opening argument violated his Fifth Amendment rights and that there were evidentiary errors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We treat each defendant's claims separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>Sullivan</p>\n    <p>Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we \"review the record to determine whether the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom, taken as a whole and in the light most favorable to the prosecution, would allow a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants were guilty as charged.\"  United States v.

First, Sullivan says, it is undisputed that the gun belonged to Platt and that the night manager did not see who carried the gun.   He claims no other evidence linked him to the gun.   Second, he says that the weakness of the evidence is revealed by the jury's acquitting him of being a felon in possession of a firearm and of possessing an unregistered weapon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the latter, \" '[v]erdict inconsistency does not indicate that the government necessarily failed to prove an essential element of its case beyond a reasonable doubt.' \"  United States v.

An inconsistent verdict does not require vacating a criminal conviction as long as the appellate court is satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to sustain the counts of conviction.

It was clear that at least one of the robbers carried the sawed-off shotgun.   The night manager testified that the robber who accosted him brandished a shotgun.   That robber \"used\" the firearm.   See Bailey v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span> (1995).   A reasonable jury could have found that Sullivan was that robber.   Braley testified that after the robbery, in the car, Sullivan put a pretend gun to Braley's head, apparently imitating what he had done to the night manager.   And, there was testimony that Sullivan, in advance of the robbery, while at Platt's home, picked up the gun and commented that it would be good to use in a robbery.   The evidence showed that the two robbers walked across the field to the Inn.  It is reasonable to infer that the gun was brought to the Inn by one or both and that the two robbers were each aware of the shotgun and its intended use.   A sawed-off shotgun is hardly inconspicuous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The gun was brought back from the robbery and put in the bag later abandoned by the four men in the car.   In the bag were the masks and camouflage garments also used in the robbery.   The evidence was sufficient to show that Sullivan knew the shotgun would be used or carried during the robbery and that he took some action intending to cause the gun to be used or carried.

As a result, he must meet the strictures of plain error review.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b);  Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d at 1156.   In this instance the standard of review does not alter the outcome because there was no error in the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, as I have indicated to you, the government has the burden of proving the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.   Some of you may have served as jurors in civil cases and when you were told that it is only necessary to prove that a fact is more likely true than not true, in a civil case, that's the burden.   In criminal cases, the government's proof is subject to a higher standard.   It must be beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, there's been several suggestions made to you during the course of argument with regard to reasonable doubt.   And I point out to you that the lawyers have the right, indeed the responsibility, to point out to you those facts or that evidence or those interpretations of legal principles that is more persuasive to their side of the case.   I instruct you that, if what I am telling you about the law differs in any way with what the lawyers have told you about the law, I'm instructing you to follow the law as I give it to you and not as the lawyers suggest[ ] it may be if there is a difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Reasonable doubt\" has now been defined for you in several different ways by counsel, and I instruct you that reasonable doubt defines itself--a doubt that is reasonable.   It has a plain meaning, and you as jurors can consider the plain meaning of reasonable doubt with what the words say.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only caveat that you must be clear about as it relates to reasonable doubt is that the government must prove the guilt of each of the defendants for the crimes involved beyond a reasonable doubt as you interpret that term.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge thus left the fine tuning of the meaning of \"reasonable doubt\" to the jurors, as is appropriate under our precedent.   See United States v. Cassiere, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194928\"><a href=\"/opinion/194928/united-states-v-cassiere/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span>, 1024 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan says that by referring to the definitions given by counsel, the judge incorporated erroneous definitions.   The argument suffers from three flaws.   First, that is not a fair reading of the instruction, which told the jurors what the judge's instructions were.   Second, the reference to counsel's definitions was followed immediately by a statement that the judge's instructions on the law were to be followed, and, if there were differences, not the lawyers'.   Third, to the extent that Sullivan's argument rests on the premise that his own counsel gave an erroneous definition of reasonable doubt, we will not entertain such an argument.   Cf. United States v.

For several reasons, ineffective assistance claims are not usually heard on direct appeal.   See United States v. Diaz-Martinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196470\"><a href=\"/opinion/196470/united-states-v-diaz-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span>, 953 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

There is no reason here to depart from that rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the extent he makes claims independent of the ineffective assistance of counsel claim, they fail on their own.   Sullivan complains that, despite Platt's objection which resulted in excluding the evidence, the evidence should have been admitted that Platt and Braley committed a robbery of the Econolodge the week before the robbery of the Inn.  Sullivan urges that the evidence would have been useful to impeach Braley.   Failing that, he says, severance was warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His initial hurdle is that he never sought to cross-examine Braley about the Econolodge matter and he objected to the government's request to present such evidence.   Moreover, he never asked for a severance.   At best, review of his contentions is for plain error.   In a strange twist, the parties now reverse the positions they held in the trial court with the government saying the evidence was cumulative and Sullivan saying it should have been admitted.   Switching of position aside, this was a matter of discretion for the trial judge and the decision hardly requires reversal as plain error.   See United States v. Innamorati, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"609734\"><a href=\"/opinion/609734/united-states-v-kenneth-innamorati-united-states-v-william-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></a></span>, 478 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Sullivan's convictions do not rise to a \"miscarriage of justice.\"   See Edgar, 82 F.3d at 510 n. 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan's second argument of trial error is also raised by Platt.   Through a series of questions, reproduced in the margin,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the prosecutor asked Sullivan whether another witness, Vaughn Stevenson, had lied when the witness said that Sullivan had complained that he wished he didn't have so many people involved in the robbery.   This court stated in United States v. Akitoye, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554021\"><a href=\"/opinion/554021/united-states-v-adegboyega-akitoye/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir.1991), that this type of questioning was improper.   Other courts have said the same.   See United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span> (1994).   If there was any ambiguity left after Akitoye, we state the rule now emphatically:  counsel should not ask one witness to comment on the veracity of the testimony of another witness.   As was explained in Akitoye:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>It is not the place of one witness to draw conclusions about, or cast aspersions upon another witness' veracity.   The \"was-the-witness-lying\" question framed by the prosecutor in this case was of that stripe.   It should never have been posed....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">923 F.2d at 224 (citations omitted).   We expect that the office of the United States Attorney<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and other counsel will abide by the rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution next misreads a line of cases primarily from the Second Circuit and suggests that this non-comment rule applies differently depending on whether the other witness is a police officer or a lay witness.   Compare Boyd, 54 F.3d at 871 (\"It is ... error for a prosecutor to induce a witness to testify that another witness, and in particular a government agent, has lied on the stand.\") and United States v. Richter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492639\"><a href=\"/opinion/492639/united-states-v-james-richter/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 208 (2d Cir.1987) (\"Prosecutorial cross-examination which compels a defendant to state that law enforcement officers lied in their testimony is improper.\") with United States v. Gaind, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675699\"><a href=\"/opinion/675699/united-states-v-arun-gaind/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 77 (2d Cir.1994) (\"[T]he opposing witnesses in this case were former [employees of defendant's business], not government agents.\") and Scanio, 900 F.2d at 493 (\"While the rule barring this type of cross-examination is not limited to situations where the defendant is asked to comment on the testimony of government agents, ... we have shown special concern with prosecutors utilizing what some persons perceive as the heightened credibility of government agents ....\" (internal citations omitted)).   The rule only applies, the prosecution says, when the other witness is a police witness, not a lay witness.   We make no such distinction, nor does the Second Circuit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  That erroneous reading misunderstands the purpose of the rule.   The rule reserves to the jury questions of credibility and thus makes it improper to induce a witness to say another witness lied on the stand.   See Boyd, 54 F.3d at 871.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That this rule was violated by the prosecution is not the end of the analysis.   The question is whether the violation of the rule was harmless.   In context, it certainly was.   While evidence of guilt is only one factor to be considered, such evidence was very strong.   See generally Harry T. Edwards, To Err Is Human, But Not Always Harmless:  When Should Legal Error Be Tolerated?, 70 N.Y.U. L.Rev. 1167 (1995).   Two witnesses testified that Platt and Sullivan committed the robbery and four witnesses tied Platt to the shotgun.   Moreover, the error was on a minor point:  whether Sullivan in his testimony would say another witness was lying when the witness said Sullivan had complained about too many people being involved in the robbery.   The other witness testified to Sullivan's complaint;  Sullivan denied making it.   The damage to Sullivan's defense came from Stevenson's direct testimony.   That there was a contradiction between that testimony and Sullivan's was obvious.   Pointing out the obvious most likely scored the government, at most, rhetorical points.   We cannot say that these few largely rhetorical questions from the prosecutor affected at all the outcome of the trial.   Cf. United States v. Wihbey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196557\"><a href=\"/opinion/196557/united-states-v-wihbey/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span>, 771 (1st Cir.1996) (improper conduct on part of prosecutor not implicating a constitutional right does not require reversal unless it affected the outcome of the trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan also argues that some of the comments made by the prosecution in its closing argument were improper vouching for the credibility of certain witnesses.   The prosecutor argued:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government would suggest that, again, Tim Boudreau, if you assess his believability on the witness stand, he came off pretty believable.   But you have to make that judgment, ladies and gentlemen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">... The government suggests to you [Cray] couldn't have lied about anything up on the witness stand.   He couldn't--if he was lying, he couldn't even remember his own name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">And on rebuttal, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p>The government suggests ... that they were up there telling the truth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...

See United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196554\"><a href=\"/opinion/196554/united-states-v-cruz-quilan/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While some of the statements may have been an appropriate response to the defendants' attack on the government witnesses' credibility, see id., others may have crossed the line into improper vouching.   See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 771-73 (comment that \"what they have done is testified ... truthfully about what they knew\" was improper vouching);  United States v. Manning, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/195356/united-states-v-manning/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span>, 572 (1st Cir.1994) (improper witness vouching for prosecutor to argue:  \"If [police witness] is going to come in and lie to you he could have done that very, very easily.   There's a million little ways they could have given it to the Defendant.   But they cannot.   The prosecution witnesses cannot engage in that kind of conduct.   They're bound by the truth....  They're bound by their oath and limits of honesty.\").   Nevertheless, no miscarriage of justice resulted and the comments did not impact the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings and so should not be noticed as plain error.   See Collins, 60 F.3d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>Platt</p>\n    <p>Prosecutor's Opening Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Platt argues that the prosecutor's statement in opening that the jury would \"meet\" the two defendants was an improper comment on whether the defendants would testify.   Sullivan objected to the comment and at the end of the opening, Platt moved for a mistrial.   The district court denied the motion, but offered to give a cautionary instruction.   Apparently for strategic reasons, the defendants rejected the offer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the prosecutor's argument violated the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is reviewed de novo.  United States v. Hardy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679959\"><a href=\"/opinion/679959/united-states-v-frederick-hardy/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">753</span></a></span>, 756 (1st Cir.1994).   We review the denial of the motion for mistrial for abuse of discretion.   See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 773.   There was no violation of the Fifth Amendment here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A prosecutor's comment is improper where, under the circumstances of the case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\"  Hardy, 37 F.3d at 757 (internal quotations omitted).   Sullivan's counsel agreed that the choice of words was not deliberate:  the prosecutor meant to say that the defendants would be introduced to the jury.   And in fact, the defendants' lawyers did introduce the defendants to the jury after the prosecutor made the allegedly offending remark.   In context, the prosecutor's word choice did not \"naturally and necessarily\" comment on the defendants' privilege against self-incrimination.   Cf. Hardy, 37 F.3d at 757-58 (holding that prosecutor's statement that defendants, who were sitting in the courtroom but did not testify, were \"still running and hiding today\" violated the Fifth Amendment (emphasis removed)).   Thus, there was no prosecutorial misconduct that would warrant considering mistrial.Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Platt also makes a claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction.   Platt argues that the evidence implicating him as one of the two robbers came principally from Braley and Boudreau.   Those two, Platt argues, should not have been believed because they were cooperating witnesses who gave inconsistent versions of the events that transpired on July 28, 1994.   However, \" '[c]redibility determinations are uniquely within the jury's province, and we defer to the jury's verdict if the evidence can support varying inferences.' \"  United States v. Calderon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196602\"><a href=\"/opinion/196602/united-states-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d at 62).   As the recital of the facts shows, there was ample evidence to convict Platt on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Other Evidentiary Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Platt argues that the district court erred in excluding the prior misdemeanor and juvenile convictions of certain government witnesses and that the district court abused its discretion by allowing cross-examination of Sullivan on a prior robbery conviction.   We have considered Platt's arguments and find no abuse of discretion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Platt argues that evidence that Boudreau had no prior criminal convictions should not have been admitted.   Platt argues that the evidence was admitted in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 608 to show Boudreau's good character.   Cf. Government of Virgin Islands v. Grant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460046\"><a href=\"/opinion/460046/government-of-the-virgin-islands-v-sheldon-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span>, 510-12 (3d Cir.1985) (such evidence inadmissible under Rules 404 and 405 to prove character of accused).   The record shows that it was admitted to further develop Boudreau's background and it was thus within the discretion of the district court.   Cf. United States v. Blackwell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509533\"><a href=\"/opinion/509533/united-states-v-michael-blackwell/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span>, 88 (2d Cir.1988) (error to strike background evidence that defendant had no prior arrests);  Grant, 775 F.2d at 513 (trial court has wide discretion as to admission of background evidence).
