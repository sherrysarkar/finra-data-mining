In early 1998 the A.T. Cross\n\nCorporation,   a   venerable    New   England    maker   of   fine   pens   and\n\npencils, entered the personal electronic devices market by offering\n\npen-based computing products through its Pen Computing Group (PCG).\n\nThe stars of its new line were the CrossPad and its later-\n\nintroduced smaller cousin, the CrossPad XP.             Cross had high hopes\n\nfor its new product line and expressed those hopes publicly in\n\nSeptember 1997 by saying it expected to report a minimum of $25\n\nmillion in profitable sales for PCG in 1998.                  Indeed, one of\n\nCross's officers compared its fledgling product to the highly\nsuccessful Palm Pilot.\n          Reality did not keep pace with these projections.                  By\nlate 1999 Cross had discontinued the product line and suffered\n\nlosses that year of $24.3 million, which essentially eliminated\nprofits from the $24.8 million in sales on the PCG products in\n1998.\n\n          Michael Aldridge brought this securities action in April\n2000 as a putative class action on behalf of those who purchased\nCross common stock between September 17, 1997 and April 22, 1999\n(the class period).     An amended complaint asserts claims against\n\nthe company, four officers of the company, and certain trusts which\n\nown part of Cross.     The complaint alleges violations of section\n\n10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. ยง\n\n78j(b) (2000), and Rule 10b-5 under that Act, 17 C.F.R. ยง 240.10b-5\n\n(2001), against the company, the individual defendants, and the\n\ntrusts.   It   also   alleges    a    section   20(a)    claim   against    the\n\n                                      -3-\n\findividual and trust defendants as \"controlling person[s].\"1               15\n\nU.S.C. ยง 78t(a) (2000).\n\n           On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion by the defendants, the district\ncourt dismissed the action.      Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp., No. 00-\n\n203ML (D.R.I. June 4, 2001).      The court did not reach the question\n\nof whether to certify a class.\n           We reverse the dismissal of the claims against the\n\nindividual defendants and the company.            We find that there is\n\nsufficient factual support for the allegations of fraud and a\n\nstrong inference of scienter to survive a motion to dismiss under\n\nthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA).             We affirm\n\nthe   dismissal   of   the   section    20(a)   claim   against   the   trust\n\ndefendants on different grounds; on these pleadings, the trust\ndefendants cannot be considered \"controlling persons\" for the\n\npurpose of section 20(a) liability.\n\n                                       I.\n           Because this is an appeal from a motion to dismiss, we\n\ndescribe the facts in the case in the light most favorable to\n\nAldridge, the plaintiff and nonmoving party.            Doe v. Walker, 193\n\nF.3d 42, 42 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n\n      1\n          The individual defendants were members of the Cross\nmanagement team during the class period: Bradford Boss, Chairman of\nCross's board; Russell Boss, President and CEO of Cross; John\nBuckley, Executive Vice President and COO; and John T. Ruggieri,\nSenior Vice President and CFO. The trust defendants are: the W.\nRussell Boss Jr. Trust A; the W. Russell Boss Jr. Trust B; and the\nW. Russell Boss Jr. Trust C. For purposes of all but the section\n20(a) analysis, we refer to all of the defendants as the company.\n\n                                   -4-\n\f            Cross is a publicly traded company on the American Stock\n\nExchange. For over a century, Cross has been producing traditional\n\nhigh-end writing instruments.           By the mid 1990s, sales of these\nproducts were dropping off, and the company's stock price had\n\ndecreased      significantly    since    1990.        In    July   1996,   Cross\n\nestablished a new division it called the Pen Computing Group (PCG)\nin an effort to \"bridge . . . the worlds of traditional and\n\nelectronic paper,\" to expand the company's traditional product\n\nbase, and \"to return Cross to acceptable margins and earnings.\"\n\n            One of these PCG products was the CrossPad, unveiled in\nNovember 1997, and first shipped in March 1998.               The CrossPad XP,\n\na smaller model, was introduced to the market in October 1998.               The\nCrossPads were electronic note pads with digital pens, with which\na user wrote on a note pad atop a battery powered unit.                The pens\n\nwrote on the paper in the traditional way and also recorded the pen\nstrokes for later connection to a computer.                Once the information\nwas stored in a computer, it could be viewed, searched, and\n\notherwise used.\n            There was a great deal of optimism about the CrossPads\nand their positive impact on Cross as a whole.                On September 17,\n\n1997, even before unveiling the CrossPad, Cross issued a press\nrelease announcing that the company expected at least $25 million\nin profitable sales from PCG in 1998.             On March 23, 1998, Cross\n\nfiled a 10-K report with the SEC for the fiscal year 1997, which\nstated: \"We look at 1998 as a year where . . . our Pen Computing\n\nGroup   will    provide   its   first    year    of   significant    sales   and\n\n                                    -5-\n\fearnings.\"        The bulk of PCG's business was the CrossPad product\n\nline.   In an April 1998 article in Value Line, an investment\n\npublication, Cross's management said that sales of the CrossPad\nwould drive PCG's growth, and predicted sales of $200 million in\n\nthe year 2000.          In a June 1998 article in Barron's, another\n\ninvestment publication, management predicted that CrossPad could\ntriple the size of the company.         On June 30, 1998, the Cross share\n\nprice peaked for the class period at $14.25.\n\n             In    Cross's   1998   filings   with   the   SEC,   the   company\n\ncontinued to report significant sales growth for PCG products.              In\n\na business article dated February 4, 1999, the Providence Journal\n\nquoted Brian Mullins, the Director of Marketing for PCG, as saying\n\nthat PCG's \"sales for all of 1998 did meet the Company's goal of\n$25 million in sales.\"\n\n             Despite the earlier optimism, Cross began to lower the\n\nmarket's expectations beginning in early 1999.             The same February\n4 Providence Journal article discusses Mullins's comments on the\n\nrecently announced price reductions for both the CrossPad and the\n\nCrossPad XP.       He stated that the price cuts were not related to the\n\nsales of the products but were \"planned . . . from the get go\" and\n\nwere expected by the retailers. The article paraphrases Mullins as\n\nsaying that \"even with the price cuts, the company will still make\n\na profit.\"        He also said that more price cuts were expected later\n\nin the year.       On March 23, 1999, the company filed its 10-K report\n\nwith the SEC.       The report stated the success of the CrossPad sales\n\nin 1998, but it also acknowledged the price reductions and \"greater\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fmarketing support and technical development [than] planned, which\n\nresulted in a loss for Pen Computing operations.\"\n\n              On April 22, 1999, Cross announced in a press release\nthat the company's sales had dropped dramatically from $9 million\n\nin the first quarter of 1998 to $1.1 million in the first quarter\n\nof 1999.    It also expressed its expectation that revenues from PCG\nwould be a great deal lower in 1999 than they were in 1998.\n\n              On the same day, Cross's management held a conference\n\ncall   with    securities    analysts     and   investors      to   discuss   the\n\ncompany's results for the first quarter of 1999.            During the call,\n\nRussell Boss, President and CEO of Cross, explained that PCG sales\n\nhad decreased in the first quarter \"because of price protections.\"\n\nHe also mentioned \"take backs\" from customers.                  Robert Byrnes,\nPresident and CEO of PCG also spoke about \"price protection,\" and\n\nsaid that the price reductions were part of the company's original\n\nsales strategy. John Buckley, Cross's Executive Vice President and\nChief Operating Officer, also acknowledged the company's price\n\nprotection practices.       Cross did not disclose any price protection\n\nplans or take back agreements in its public financial disclosures\n\nin 1998.\n\n              Also   on   April   22,   Russell   Boss   and    Bradford      Boss\n\nannounced that they were stepping down from their positions as CEO\n\nand    executive     Chairman     respectively,   and    stepping     into     the\n\npositions of non-executive Chairman, and non-executive Chairman\n\nEmeritus.     Immediately after the end of the class period, on April\n\n22, 1999, the share price for Cross fell below $4.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f           PCG sales continued to decline in 1999. On May 13, 1999,\n\nthe company filed a 10-Q report for the first quarter of the year,\n\nand revealed for the first time in a SEC filing a \"rebate\" program\nit had with its customers.     In a 10-Q report issued on August 13,\n\n1999, the company reported over $8 million in losses for PCG in the\n\nsecond quarter of 1999, and an 85% decline in PCG sales compared to\nthe same quarter the previous year.          The company pointed to the\n\nexcess inventory its customers had as a reason for the decrease in\n\nsales.\n\n           Finally, the CrossPad product line was discontinued at\n\nthe end of 1999 because of poor performance in the market.              In a\n\nForm 10-K filed on March 23, 2000, Cross's new President and CEO\n\ndiscussed PCG's decline in 1999.         He stated:\n           Early in the year [1999] it became clear that our\n           investment[] in the Pen Computing Group . . . w[as] a\n           significant drain on the Company's financial and human\n           resources.   As a result, in the fourth quarter, the\n           Company discontinued the CrossPad product line . . . .\nThe   company   also   described   a   revenue   recognition   policy    not\n\ndisclosed earlier, which stated: \"Revenue from sales is recognized\nupon shipment or delivery of goods.        Provision is made at the time\n\nthe related revenue is recognized for estimated product returns,\n\nterm discounts and rebates.\"\n\n           Aldridge, the plaintiff, brought a claim under section\n\n10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. ยง\n\n78j(b) (2000), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. ยง 240.10b-5 (2001), for\n\nfraud against Cross, members of its top management team, and three\n\ntrusts that own a large number of shares in the company.        He argues\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fthat the statements made by the company and its management during\n\nthe class period were misleading in light of the company's sales\n\nand accounting practices.         Specifically, Aldridge says that the\ncompany employed sales strategies, such as price protection, take\n\nbacks,   and   channel   stuffing,    without     disclosing    them      to   the\n\nshareholders, or reserving for them in financial statements, as\nthey were obligated to do.         Aldridge also brought a claim under\n\nsection 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.\n\nยง 78t(a) (2000), against the individual defendants and the trust\n\ndefendants as \"controlling persons\" of the corporation.                  Aldridge\n\nargues that the trust defendants, \"[b]y reason of their ownership\n\nand ability to select two-thirds of the Board,\" and the individual\n\ndefendants     influenced   and   steered   the    company     to   engage      in\nfraudulent conduct.\n\n           The   district   court    dismissed     the   action     on    a    Rule\n\n12(b)(6) motion under the standards of the Private Securities\nLitigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 15 U.S.C. ยง 78u-4 (2000),\n\nfinding Aldridge had neither provided sufficient factual support\n\nfor the allegations of fraud nor raised a strong inference of\n\nscienter. Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp., No. 00-203ML, slip. op. at\n\n10-15 (D.R.I. June 4, 2001).       The district court, without reaching\n\nthe details of the controlling person issue, also dismissed the\n\nsection 20(a) claim against the individual defendants and the trust\n\ndefendants because it was derivative of the dismissed section 10(b)\n\nclaim.   Id. at 15-16.      The court did not reach the question of\n\nwhether to certify a class.\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f                                II.\n\n           Our review of the allowance of a motion to dismiss is de\n\nnovo.    Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc., 24 F.3d 357, 361\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).   The pleading standards for violations of section\n\n10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are found in the PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. ยง78u-4.2\n\nThis circuit's seminal case on the pleading standards under the\nPSLRA is Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., 194 F.3d 185, 193-94 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).   In Greebel, we held that the PSLRA did not alter this\n\ncircuit's rigorous reading of the standards for pleading fraud.\n\nThe plaintiff in a securities fraud action must \"specify each\n\n\n\n     2\n           The statute provides, in relevant part:\n\n           (b) Requirements for securities fraud actions\n               (1) Misleading statements and omissions\n               In any private action arising under this chapter in\n               which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant --\n                    (A) made an untrue statement of a material\n                    fact; or\n                    (B) omitted to state a material fact necessary\n                    in order to make the statements made, in the\n                    light of the circumstances in which they\n                    were made, not misleading;\n               the complaint shall specify each statement alleged\n               to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why\n               the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation\n               regarding the statement or omission is made on\n               information and belief, the complaint shall state\n               with particularity all facts on which that belief\n               is formed.\n               (2) Required state of mind\n               In any private action arising under this chapter in\n               which the plaintiff may recover money damages only\n               on proof that the defendant acted with a particular\n               state of mind, the complaint shall, with respect to\n               each act or omission alleged to violate this\n               chapter, state with particularity facts giving rise\n               to a strong inference that the defendant acted with\n               the required state of mind.\n15 U.S.C. ยงยง 78u-4(b)(1)-(2).\n\n                                -10-\n\fallegedly misleading statement or omission\" including its time,\n\nplace and content.      Id. at 193.      The plaintiff must provide factual\n\nsupport for     the    claim   that   the      statements    or   omissions   were\nfraudulent, that is, facts that show exactly why the statements or\n\nomissions were misleading. Id. at 193-94. If the plaintiff brings\n\nhis claims on information and belief, he must \"set forth the source\nof the information and the reasons for the belief.\"                   Id. at 194\n\n(quoting Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 929 F.2d 875, 878 (1st\n\nCir. 1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff must\n\nalso show that the inferences of scienter \"are both reasonable and\n\n'strong.'\"     Id. at 195-96.\n\n             Although the pleading requirements under the PSLRA are\n\nstrict, id. at 194, they do not change the standard of review for\na motion to dismiss.        Even under the PSLRA, the district court, on\n\na motion to dismiss, must draw all reasonable inferences from the\n\nparticular allegations in the plaintiffโs favor, while at the same\ntime   requiring      the   plaintiff    to     show   a   strong   inference    of\n\nscienter.    Id. at 201; accord Helwig v. Vencor, Inc., 251 F.3d 540,\n\n553 (6th Cir. 2001) (en banc), petition for cert. filed, 70\n\nU.S.L.W. 3269 (Sept. 27, 2001) (No. 01-538).\n\nA.   Fraud Allegations\n\n             The district court correctly found that Aldridge had met\n\nthe specificity requirements as to \"time, place and content\" of the\n\nstatements said to be misleading.              Aldridge, slip. op. at 10.       The\n\ndistrict court faulted the complaint, however, for failing to\n\nprovide factual support for the allegations of fraud.                 Id. at 10-\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f11.     The district court concluded that even if Cross made false\n\nstatements or material omissions, there is no support for the\n\nproposition that the defendants knew these statements or omissions\nwere misleading at the time they were made.           It also relied on the\n\nabsence of specific figures regarding which transactions were\n\nmisstated and by what amounts.         It was here that the court erred.\nThe district court did not \"giv[e] plaintiff[] the benefit of all\n\nreasonable inferences\" as it should have on a motion to dismiss,\n\nGreebel, 194 F.3d at 201, but appears to have drawn its inferences\n\nin the defendants' favor.       We take the plaintiffโs allegations to\n\nbe true and draw inferences in the plaintiffโs favor.\n\n            Aldridge's core claim is that the reported revenues and\n\nearnings in A.T. Crossโs financial statements were artificially\ninflated, and that the statements contained omissions of material\n\nfacts.    Aldridge alleges that under generally accepted accounting\n\nprinciples (GAAP), with which Cross purported to comply, Cross was\nrequired to estimate a loss or range of loss and set a reserve with\n\nrespect to all contingent sales that were made, including sales for\n\nwhich the buyer had the right to receive a credit or allowance if\n\nthe price of the CrossPad declined before the buyer could resell\n\nthe product (i.e., price protection).               If Cross was unable to\n\nestablish a reserve or estimate the loss, it was required to\n\ndisclose the practices that gave rise to the contingent revenues\n\nand earnings. Aldridge alleges that the defendants knew that Cross\n\nhad not sufficiently reserved for the losses that inevitably would\n\noccur    when   Cross   was   forced   to   honor    its   price   protection\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fcommitments, and that their failure to disclose this to the public\n\nviolated federal regulations (specifically Item 303 of the SEC's\n\nRegulation    S-K)       and    accounting    standards.    See    17   C.F.R.   ยง\n229.303(a) (2001) (requiring that SEC filings \"provide . . .\n\ninformation that the registrant believes to be necessary to an\n\nunderstanding       of     its    financial    condition\");      Accounting    for\nContingencies, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5,\n\nยถ 10 (Financial Accounting Standards Bd. 1975); Revenue Recognition\n\nWhen Right of Return Exists, Statement of Financial Accounting\n\nStandards No. 48, ยถ 7 (Financial Accounting Standards Bd. 1981)\n\n(\"FAS 48\").    Cross has not argued that the information that was not\n\nprovided in the financial statements was not material.\n\n             The district courtโs holding hinged on a key issue:\nwhether, from the statements made by company officials in 1999, it\n\ncould be reasonably inferred that Cross had engaged in undisclosed\n\nprice protection earlier, in 1998. The district court thought not.\nIf there was no price protection or similar practice in 1998, the\n\ndistrict court concluded, then the company's financial statements\n\ndid not contain misleading omissions. Our view is to the contrary:\n\nit is an extremely reasonable inference, from the defendants'\n\nstatements in 1999, that the company had offered its customers\n\nprice protection guarantees in 1998, likely to induce them to carry\n\nthe new CrossPad product lines.                From this, it may easily be\n\ninferred     that    the       statements    were   misleading    and   that   the\n\ndefendants knew that they were misleading.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\f            There were several statements in 1999 that support the\n\ninferences.    First, in February 1999, the prices of the CrossPad\n\nproducts were discounted by up to 30%.        A February 4 business\narticle in the Providence Journal reported the price reductions and\n\ncited Mullins, the Director of Marketing, as saying that the\n\ncompany would make a profit on the CrossPads even with the price\ncuts.3    The article also reported (obviously relying on company\n\nsources and most likely on Mullins) that price cuts \"had been\n\nplanned since the products were introduced.\" Mullins was quoted as\n\nsaying    that \"the price cuts were not related to how well the units\n\nwere selling.\" Mullins said \"[w]e actually had planned it from the\n\nget go.    We told the retailers to expect it.\"\n\n            In this context, \"from the get go\" is easily read to mean\nfrom the introduction of the new product to the market in 1998.   If\n\nthe price cuts were planned from early 1998, it is entirely\n\nreasonable to think that price protection for the stores selling\nthe product was also discussed and agreed on at that time, to\n\ninsulate the retailers from the inevitable price reductions.\n\n            The price reductions were also discussed at Cross's April\n\n22, 1999 conference call with analysts and investors.    During that\n\nconference call Byrnes, the head of PCG, said that the price\n\nreductions were in line with the companyโs original strategy, but\n\n\n     3\n          At oral argument Cross argued that Mullins, the Director\nof Marketing, lacked authority to make admissions. See Fed. R.\nEvid. 801(d)(2). That seems improbable; but we need not decide it\nas an evidentiary matter as we take inferences in the plaintiffโs\nfavor, and there is a strong inference that a Director of Marketing\nhad authority to make such statements.\n\n                                 -14-\n\fwere not put into place until February 1999.                      President Russell\n\nBoss said that \"PCG business was down\" in the first quarter of 1999\n\n\"because of price protections [Cross] gave retailers.\"                       Two other\ncorporate officers, including Byrnes, mentioned that there was a\n\nprice protection program.\n\n              There is a possibility that the Cross officers used the\nterm \"price protection\" in some specialized narrow sense for a\n\nright to reimbursement offered by the company to the retailers once\n\nthe CrossPads had already been on the store shelves for some\n\nmonths.      However, on this record it is just as likely, if not more\n\nlikely, that Aldridge's more common definition of price protection\n\nis    what    was    meant:    \"Price      protection       is    a    retailerโs    or\n\ndistributorโs right to reimbursement in the event of post-sale\nprice reductions.\" As Aldridge argues, \"[t]hat price protection is\n\na    right   implies    that    it   is    bargained        for   at   the    time   the\n\nretailer/distributor           contracts         to   buy     product        from    the\nmanufacturer,\" not once the product has been on the shelves for\n\nseveral months.\n\n              Aldridge also argues that under accounting rules, booking\n\nsales subject to price protection requires adequate accounting\n\nreserves at the time of sale to offset the effects of such price\n\nprotection.         Otherwise, such sales should not be recognized as\n\nrevenue.      If a reserve is not set up -- because, for example, the\n\nsize of the contingencies was impossible to estimate -- disclosure\n\nshould be made.        See Greebel, 194 F.3d at 203 (discussing FAS 48).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\f           In dismissing the case, the district court referred to a\n\nstatement in Greebel that the absence of specific identifying\n\ninformation     as    to   the   amount   and   nature   of   contingent   sales\ntransactions was indicative of the generality of the allegations of\n\nviolations of GAAP standards such as FAS 48, and thus insufficient\n\nby itself to infer scienter.              Aldridge, slip op. at 11 (citing\n\nGreebel, 194 F.3d at 203-04).             However, in Greebel, there was no\n\nevidence   of        statements    by     management     indicating   material\n\nundisclosed contingencies, while here there was such evidence.\n\nFurther, it is reasonable to infer that in this case all customers\n\nwere offered price protection as a matter of company policy. Cross\n\nitself attributed losses in early 1999 in part to its price\n\nprotection program.         There was therefore little need for the type\nof specificity discussed in Greebel. In Greebel, the argument that\n\ncontingent sales were not properly accounted for under FAS 48 was\n\nmade largely in service of more direct claims of warehousing and\nwhiting out, claims which, even after discovery, lacked any factual\n\nsupport.   Here, in contrast, there is a reasonable inference of a\npattern of price protection. Further, the evidence that contingent\n\nsales were not accounted for as they should have been under FAS 48\n\nwas offered in Greebel as indirect evidence of scienter, and there\n\nwas discounted, in the absence of particulars and other evidence of\n\nscienter. Greebel did not hold that a plaintiff, before discovery,\n\nmust in every case allege the amount of overstatement of revenues\n\nand earnings in order to state a claim that undisclosed price\n\nprotection schemes were fraudulent. 194 F.3d at 204 (relying on\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f\"complete absence\" of particulars but refusing to hold that such\n\ninformation must appear in a complaint).\n\n           Aldridge also attempts to support the inference that a\nprice protection program was entered into in 1998 but not disclosed\n\nat the time with allegations of two corollary practices:        take\n\nbacks and channel stuffing.    A \"take back\" is a promise to take\nback goods from customers who have been unable to sell them.     In\n\nthe April 22, 1999 conference call, Russell Boss specifically used\n\nthe phrase \"take back.\"   Again, it is reasonable to infer that a\n\ntake back guarantee for the retailers of CrossPads was agreed to in\n\n1998, because a take back agreement, just like price protection, is\n\nlikely to have been part of the original bargain between Cross and\n\nits customers.     No take back agreements were disclosed in the\ncompanyโs 1998 public statements and filings.       The take back\n\nallegations therefore support Aldridge's claim that Cross engaged\n\nin undisclosed price protection.\n           Channel stuffing, in turn, was defined in Greebel:\n\n           \"Channel stuffing\" means inducing purchasers to increase\n           substantially their purchases before they would, in the\n           normal course, otherwise purchase products from the\n           company. It has the result of shifting earnings into\n           earlier quarters, quite likely to the detriment of\n           earnings in later quarters.\n\n194 F.3d at 202.    Aldridge's allegation is that 50% of the store\n\nplacements for the CrossPad took place in the last four months of\n\n1998 and that 36% of PCG sales occurred in the last three months of\n\n1998.    These figures might well be explained by holiday season\n\nsales.    Beyond that, the second quarter 1999 Form 10-Q report\n\nstated that the 85% reduction in sales from the prior year was\n\n                               -17-\n\fattributable     to   retailers    having     significantly    reduced    their\n\npurchases as they reduced their current inventory levels.                 Also,\n\nthe companyโs expenses were higher as it administered a rebate\npromotion \"to reduce channel inventory at the retail level.\"               This\n\ninformation may or may not suggest that more inventory was in the\n\nhands of the retailers than commercially warranted.                   \"There is\nnothing inherently improper in pressing for sales to be made\n\nearlier than in the normal course,\" id. at 202, and in this case,\n\nthe channel stuffing allegations at present are neutral.                  After\n\ndiscovery, however, they may play a supporting role in buttressing\n\nthe price protection inferences.\n\n             The company says this is a garden variety \"fraud by\n\nhindsight\" case, occasioned by the large drop in sales of CrossPad\nproducts after 1998. That characterization is off the mark. Fraud\n\nby   hindsight   occurs   when     a   plaintiff    \"simply    contrast[s]    a\n\ndefendant's past optimism with less favorable actual results, and\nthen 'contend[s] that the difference must be attributable to\n\nfraud.'\"     Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1223 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (quoting DiLeo v. Ernst & Young, 901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th\n\nCir. 1990)).     In this case, on the other hand, Aldridge complains\n\nthat   the   company   failed     to   disclose    certain    known    material\n\ninformation as to the contingent nature of the sales, and that\n\nCross essentially admitted to the 1998 contingencies in 1999.\n\n             The allegations of fraud in the complaint have sufficient\n\nfactual support to survive a motion to dismiss.          A closer question\n\nis whether the allegations of scienter are sufficient.\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fB.   Scienter\n\n            Scienter, which is a requirement for liability under\n\nsection 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, is \"a mental state embracing intent\nto deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\"      Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n\n425 U.S. 185, 193 n.12 (1976).      To win a section 10(b) case, the\n\nplaintiff must show either that the defendants consciously intended\nto defraud, or that they acted with a high degree of recklessness.\n\nGreebel, 194 F.3d at 198-201.\n\n            In Greebel, we held that the PSLRA did not mandate a\n\nparticular test to determine scienter and that this court would\n\ncontinue to use its case by case fact-specific approach; \"we . . .\n\nanalyze[] the particular facts alleged in each individual case to\n\ndetermine   whether   the   allegations   were   sufficient   to   support\nscienter.\" 194 F.3d at 196; accord City of Philadelphia v. Fleming\n\nCos., 264 F.3d 1245, 1262-63 (10th Cir. 2001) (adopting Greebel's\n\nfact-specific approach); Helwig, 251 F.3d at 551 (same). Thus, the\nplaintiff may combine various facts and circumstances indicating\n\nfraudulent intent to show a strong inference of scienter.          As part\nof the mix of facts, the plaintiff may allege that the defendants\n\nhad the motive (\"concrete benefits that could be realized by . . .\n\nthe false statements and wrongful nondisclosures\") and opportunity\n\n(\"the means and likely prospect of achieving concrete benefits by\n\nthe means alleged\") to commit the fraud.     Novak v. Kasaks, 216 F.3d\n\n300, 307 (2d Cir.) (quoting Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp, Inc., 25\n\nF.3d 1124, 1130 (2d Cir. 1994)), cert denied, 531 U.S. 1012 (2000).\n\nHowever, as we stated in Greebel, while mere allegations of motive\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fand opportunity alone may be insufficient, together with additional\n\nfactual support, evidence of motive and opportunity may establish\n\na strong inference of scienter.          194 F.3d at 197.\n          In evaluating whether the inferences of scienter are\n\nstrong,   we    agree    with    the    Sixth   Circuitโs    language   that:\n\n\"Inferences must be reasonable and strong -- but not irrefutable.\n. . . Plaintiffs need not foreclose all other characterizations of\n\nfact, as the task of weighing contrary accounts is reserved for the\n\nfact finder.\"    Helwig, 251 F.3d at 553.          The plaintiff must show\n\nthat his characterization of the events and circumstances as\n\nshowing scienter is highly likely.\n\n          Taking        all     the    facts     and    circumstances   into\n\nconsideration, the complaint survives the requirement that its\npleadings raise a strong inference of scienter.                First, strong\n\ninferences can be made that the company offered price protection\n\nand take back arrangements in 1998.4            These arrangements, if they\nexisted, were not disclosed, and that nondisclosure could hardly\n\nhave been inadvertent.           The company only disclosed the price\n\nprotection and take back agreements in an April 1999 conference\n\ncall with industry analysts and investors.             Full public disclosure\n\nof the agreements only occurred in the Form 10-Q report filed on\n\nMay 13, 1999.     Although the company officials referred to \"price\n\nprotection\" during the conference call, the report used the term\n\n\n     4\n          Aldridge could have buttressed his case by obtaining\ninformation, if available absent discovery, from Cross's customers\non the price protection and take back allegations. In another case\nthe failure to make that effort might prove fatal. Here it is not.\n\n                                       -20-\n\f\"rebates,\" which may suggest an attempt to recharacterize the\n\nevents.    Of course, more than mere proof that the defendants made\n\na particular false or misleading statement is required to show\nscienter.    Geffon v. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).    However, the fact that the defendants published statements\n\nwhen they knew facts suggesting the statements were inaccurate or\nmisleadingly incomplete is classic evidence of scienter. Fl. State\n\nBd. of Admin. v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 270 F.3d 645, 665 (8th Cir.\n\n2001) (collecting cases from various circuit courts).\n\n            Second, building on the reasonable inference that either\n\nor both the price protection or take back guarantees were in place\n\nin 1998, it may also be inferred that accounting standards required\n\nthat a reserve be established or at least that Cross disclose the\nsales practices in its financial statements. This is also evidence\n\nof scienter.    See Geffon, 249 F.3d at 35 (noting that \"accounting\n\nshenanigans\" may be evidence of scienter).    There is evidence that\nthe defendants acted with knowledge and intent when they did not\n\naccount for the sales practices in the company's reports in 1998.\nIn the Form 10-K filed by the company on March 23, 2000, after a\n\nnew company president was installed, Cross disclosed for the first\n\ntime after the dramatic PCG losses, a revenue recognition policy:\n\n\"Revenue from sales is recognized upon shipment or delivery of\n\ngoods.     Provision is made at the time the related revenue is\n\nrecognized for product returns, term discounts and rebates.\"\n\n            The company argues that because it has never restated any\n\nof its financials or otherwise indicated any error in the 1998\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\ffinancial statements, and because its financial statements were\n\naudited   by    an    independent    accounting       firm,    no    inference   of\n\naccounting error, and so no inference of scienter, can be drawn.\nWe disagree.      Had the 1998 financials been restated, that might\n\nwell have been useful to Aldridge.                 However, the fact that the\n\nfinancial statements for the year in question were not restated\ndoes not end Aldridge's case when he has otherwise met the pleading\n\nrequirements of the PSLRA.               To hold otherwise would shift to\n\naccountants the responsibility that belongs to the courts.                       It\n\nwould also allow officers and directors of corporations to exercise\n\nan unwarranted degree of control over whether they are sued,\n\nbecause   they       must   agree   to   a   restatement      of    the   financial\n\nstatements.\n            Third, the Cross corporate officers had some particular\n\nfinancial incentives to load sales and earnings into 1998.                    Their\n\ncompensation depended on the companyโs earnings; as Cross correctly\nnotes, that fact alone is not and cannot be enough to establish\n\nscienter.      Green Tree, 270 F.3d at 661; Fleming Cos., 264 F.3d at\n\n1269-70; Novak, 216 F.3d at 307.                What makes this case different\n\nare the inferences that corporate officers understood in 1997 and\n\n1998 that the success of the new products, and of taking the old\n\nline company into a new world, was important to their own survival\n\nand that of the company.             Indeed, the complaint alleges that\n\nRussell said, \"If I canโt turn the company around in one year, I\n\nwonโt be here.\"        This gave incentive to maximize 1998 earnings in\n\nparticular.      When financial incentives to exaggerate earnings go\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\ffar beyond the usual arrangements of compensation based on the\n\ncompany's earnings, they may be considered among other facts to\n\nshow scienter.       See, e.g., Green Tree, 270 F.3d at 661 (reversing\ntrial court decision based on lack of scienter where it was\n\nreasonable    to     infer   that     defendant    officer     maximized    his\n\ncompensation by overstating earnings before his contract ran out).\n            More specifically, the individual defendants were the\n\nones who set the target sales goal of $25 million, and their jobs\n\nwere in jeopardy if the goals were not met.          Moreover, the CrossPad\n\nproduct line was very important to Cross.               In April 1998 the\n\ndefendants were quoted as stating that the CrossPad would be the\n\nprimary driver of PCGโs growth.              In a September 30, 1998 press\n\nrelease, Cross stated that the sales of PCG products made up 34% of\nthe companyโs total domestic revenue.             That being so, there was\n\nincentive to maximize profits in 1998 by various means.                      See\n\nGreebel, 194 F.3d at 196 (stating that \"self-interested motivation\nof defendants in the form of saving their salaries or jobs\" may be\n\nevidence of scienter).       As it turned out, the company President,\nRussell Boss, and Chairman, Bradford Boss, did resign after the\n\ndisastrous first quarter 1999 results were made public.\n\n            Playing    lesser   but   supporting     roles    in   the   factual\n\nanalysis,    there    were   the    additional    financial    incentives    to\n\nmanagement to overstate 1998 profits.             The exercise price of the\n\nindividual defendants' stock options was lowered in 1997, just\n\nbefore the introduction of the new product line.                   The exercise\n\nprice was lowered again to match the market price in December 1998.\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fThere is no evidence that the defendants exercised their options;\n\nAldridge's point is rather that the adjustment in price created\n\nincentives to \"boost A.T. Cross share price.\"          The adjustments in\nthe exercise price of the defendants' stock options alone are not\n\nenough to create a strong inference of scienter.          But this fact is\n\nnot alone here.    While this case does not involve trading while in\npossession    of   material   nonpublic    information,      which   in   some\n\ncircumstances may be taken to support allegations of motive, see,\n\ne.g., Acito v. IMCERA Grp., 47 F.3d 47, 54 (2d Cir. 1995),                there\n\nwere sufficient other sources of financial motive that make the\n\nabsence of such evidence less important here.\n\n           Our conclusion that Aldridge's section 10(b) and Rule\n\n10b-5 claim survives a motion to dismiss is only that.                      The\ndefendants may yet prevail once the facts of the case are further\n\ndeveloped.5\n\nC.   Section 20(a) Claim\n\n          The district courtโs dismissal of the section 20(a) claim\n\nwas derivative of its dismissal of the section 10(b) claim.                 See\n\nSuna v. Bailey Corp., 107 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir. 1997).               Because\n\nthere must be a primary violation for liability under section\n\n20(a), the district court did not independently evaluate whether\n\nthe claim otherwise failed. Nonetheless, we \"may affirm a district\n\ncourt's   judgment    on   any   grounds   supported    by    the    record.\"\n\nGreenless v. Almond, 277 F.3d 601, 605 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n\n     5\n          We leave to the district court on remand Aldridgeโs\nargument that there is a sub-class of the 1999 investors.\n\n                                   -24-\n\f            As to the trust defendants only, the matter is plain\n\nenough to affirm the dismissal of the section 20(a) claim against\n\nthem.    Section 20(a) provides:\n            Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls\n            any person liable under any provision of this chapter or\n            of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable\n            jointly and severally with and to the same extent as\n            such controlled person . . . unless the controlling\n            person acted in good faith and did not directly or\n            indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the\n            violation or cause of action.\n\n15 U.S.C. ยง 78t(a) (2000).\n\n            The trust defendants argue that this court should adopt\n\na three part test for controlling person liability, under which the\n\nplaintiff must allege and prove: (1) an underlying violation by a\ncontrolled   person   or   entity;    (2)   the   defendants   control   the\n\nviolator; and (3) the defendants are in a meaningful sense culpable\n\nparticipants in the fraud in question.            See SEC v. First Jersey\n\nSecs. Inc., 101 F.3d 1450, 1472 (2d Cir. 1996).            They correctly\n\ndescribed a split among the circuits on whether an element of\n\nsection 20(a) liability is \"culpable participation.\"6            We do not\n\nreach that question, but rest on the \"control\" element.\n\n            To meet the control element, the alleged controlling\n\nperson must not only have the general power to control the company,\n\nbut must also actually exercise control over the company.                See\n\n     6\n          Whether culpable participation is a required element of\nliability under section 20(a) has generated a great deal of\ndiscussion.   Compare First Jersey Secs., 101 F.3d at 1472-73\n(applying such a requirement), with Hollinger v. Titan Capital\nCorp., 914 F.2d 1564, 1575 (9th Cir. 1990) (en banc) (rejecting\nsuch a requirement); see generally 3C H. Bloomenthal & S. Wolff,\nSecurities and Federal Corporate Law ยง 14.9 (2d ed. 1999)\n(discussing the culpable participant requirement).\n\n                                     -25-\n\fSheinkopf v. Stone, 927 F.2d 1259, 1270 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"For [the\n\ndefendant]     to    be   liable    .   .     .    there    must    be    'significantly\n\nprobative' evidence that the [defendant] exercised, directly or\nindirectly, meaningful hegemony over the . . . venture . . . .\")\n\n(internal citation omitted); see also Harrison v. Dean Witter\n\nReynolds, Inc., 974 F.2d 873, 880-881 (7th Cir. 1992) (describing\na similar requirement).            In this case, the trust defendants have\n\nthe power to elect two-thirds of the directors.                         But they have no\n\ndirect control over the management and operations of the company.\n\nAt   most   the     evidence    pled    is     that       the   trust    defendants    are\n\ncontrolling shareholders. This indicates some potential ability to\n\ncontrol.    In the absence of some indicia of the exercise of control\n\nover the entity primarily liable, however, that status alone is not\nenough.     Although controlling shareholders own the majority of the\n\nshares in a company, they, like any other shareholders, should have\n\nthe ability to be passive, leaving the management to the directors\nand officers.       See L. Carson, The Liability of Controlling Persons\n\nUnder the Federal Securities Acts, 72 Notre Dame L. Rev. 263, 318-\n\n19   (1997).        Unless     there    are       facts    that    indicate     that   the\n\ncontrolling       shareholders      were      actively          participating    in    the\n\ndecisionmaking processes of the corporation, no controlling person\n\nliability can be imposed.                In this case, no facts are pled\n\npermitting     an    inference      that      the     trust       defendants    actually\n\nexercised control over Cross.\n\n                                            III.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -26-\n\f          The case will be reinstated as to the company and the\n\nindividual defendants.     The district court may wish to consider\n\nlimiting discovery initially to key issues.           Nothing in this\nopinion, of course, predicts any outcome if a postdiscovery summary\n\njudgment motion is filed or the matter goes to trial.       Where there\n\nis smoke, there is not always fire.\n          Accordingly, we reverse the dismissal of the section\n\n10(b) claim and the section 20(a) claim against the company and the\n\nindividual   defendants;   we   affirm,   on   different   grounds,   the\n\ndismissal of the section 20(a) claim against the trust defendants.\n\nNo costs are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\f",

Cross Corporation, a venerable New England maker of fine pens and pencils, entered the personal electronic devices market by offering penbased computing products through its Pen Computing Group (PCG). The stars of its new line were the CrossPad and its later-introduced smaller cousin, the CrossPad XP. Cross had high hopes for its new product line and expressed those hopes publicly in September 1997 by saying it expected to report a minimum of $25 million in profitable sales for PCG in 1998. Indeed, one of Cross's officers compared its fledgling product to the highly successful Palm Pilot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reality did not keep pace with these projections. By late 1999 Cross had discontinued the product line and suffered losses that year of $24.3 million, which essentially eliminated profits from the $24.8 million in sales on the PCG products in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Michael Aldridge brought this securities action in April 2000 as a putative class action on behalf of those who purchased Cross common stock between September 17, 1997 and April 22, 1999 (the class period). An amended complaint asserts claims against the company, four officers of the company, and certain trusts which own part of Cross. The complaint alleges violations of section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b) (2000), and Rule 10b-5 under that Act, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5 (2001), against the company, the individual defendants, and the trusts. It also alleges a section 20(a) claim against the individual and trust defendants as \"controlling person[s].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion by the defendants, the district court dismissed the action. <i>Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,</i> No. 00-203ML (D.R.I. June 4, 2001). The court did not reach the question of whether to certify a class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the dismissal of the claims against the individual defendants and the company. We find that there is sufficient factual support for the allegations of fraud and a strong inference of scienter to survive a motion to dismiss under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA). We affirm the dismissal of the section 20(a) claim against the trust defendants on different grounds; on these pleadings, the trust defendants cannot be considered \"controlling persons\" for the purpose of section 20(a) liability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because this is an appeal from a motion to dismiss, we describe the facts in the case in the light most favorable to Aldridge, the plaintiff and nonmoving party. <i>Doe v. Walker,</i> 193 F.3d 42, 42 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cross is a publicly traded company on the American Stock Exchange. For over a century, Cross has been producing traditional high-end writing instruments. By the mid 1990s, sales of these products were dropping off, and the company's stock price had decreased significantly since 1990. In July 1996, Cross established a new division it called the Pen Computing Group (PCG) in an effort to \"bridge ... the worlds of traditional and electronic paper,\" to expand the company's traditional product base, and \"to return Cross to acceptable margins and earnings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of these PCG products was the CrossPad, unveiled in November 1997, and first shipped in March 1998. The CrossPad XP, a smaller model, was introduced to the market in October 1998. The CrossPads were electronic note pads with digital pens, with which a user wrote on a note pad atop a battery powered unit. The pens wrote on the paper in the traditional way and also recorded the pen strokes for later connection to a computer. Once the information was stored in a computer, it could be viewed, searched, and otherwise used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a great deal of optimism about the CrossPads and their positive impact on Cross as a whole. On September 17, 1997, even before unveiling the CrossPad, Cross issued a press release announcing that the company expected at least $25 million in profitable sales from PCG in 1998. On March 23, 1998, Cross filed a 10-K report with the SEC for the fiscal year 1997, which stated: \"We look at 1998 as a year where ... our Pen Computing Group will provide its first year of significant sales and earnings.\" The bulk of PCG's business was the CrossPad product line. In an April 1998 article in <i>Value Line,</i> an investment publication, Cross's management said that sales of the CrossPad would drive PCG's growth, and predicted sales of $200 million in the year 2000. In a June 1998 article in <i>Barron's,</i> another investment publication, management predicted that CrossPad could triple the size of the company. On June 30, 1998, the Cross share price peaked for the class period at $14.25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Cross's 1998 filings with the SEC, the company continued to report significant sales growth for PCG products. In a business article dated February 4, 1999, the Providence Journal quoted Brian Mullins, the Director of Marketing for PCG, as saying that PCG's \"sales for all of 1998 did meet the Company's goal of $25 million in sales.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the earlier optimism, Cross began to lower the market's expectations beginning in early 1999. The same February 4 Providence Journal article discusses Mullins's comments on the recently announced price reductions for both the CrossPad and the CrossPad XP. He stated that the price cuts were not related to the sales of the products but were \"planned... from the get go\" and were expected by the retailers. The article paraphrases Mullins as saying that \"even with the price cuts, the company will still make a profit.\" He also said that more price cuts were expected later in the year. On March 23, 1999, the company filed its 10-K report with the SEC. The report stated the success of the CrossPad sales in 1998, but it also acknowledged the price reductions and \"greater marketing support and technical development [than] planned, which resulted in a loss for Pen Computing operations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 22, 1999, Cross announced in a press release that the company's sales had dropped dramatically from $9 million in the first quarter of 1998 to $1.1 million in the first quarter of 1999. It also expressed its expectation that revenues from PCG would be a great deal lower in 1999 than they were in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, Cross's management held a conference call with securities analysts and investors to discuss the company's results for the first quarter of 1999. During the call, Russell Boss, President and CEO of Cross, explained that PCG sales had decreased in the first quarter \"because of price protections.\" He also mentioned \"take backs\" from customers. Robert Byrnes, President and CEO of PCG also spoke about \"price protection,\" and said that the price reductions were part of the company's original sales strategy. John Buckley, Cross's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, also acknowledged the company's price protection practices. Cross did not disclose any price protection plans or take back agreements in its public financial disclosures in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on April 22, Russell Boss and Bradford Boss announced that they were stepping down from their positions as CEO and executive Chairman respectively, and stepping into the positions of non-executive Chairman, and non-executive Chairman Emeritus. Immediately after the end of the class period, on April 22, 1999, the share price for Cross fell below $4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCG sales continued to decline in 1999. On May 13, 1999, the company filed a 10-Q report for the first quarter of the year and revealed for the first time in a SEC filing a \"rebate\" program it had with its customers. In a 10-Q report issued on August 13, 1999, the company reported over $8 million in losses for PCG in the second quarter of 1999, and an 85% decline in PCG sales compared to the same quarter the previous year. The company pointed to the excess inventory its customers had as a reason for the decrease in sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the CrossPad product line was discontinued at the end of 1999 because of poor performance in the market. In a Form 10-K filed on March 23, 2000, Cross's new President and CEO discussed PCG's decline in 1999. He stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in the year [1999] it became clear that our investment[] in the Pen Computing Group ... w[as] a significant drain on the Company's financial and human resources. As a result, in the fourth quarter, the Company discontinued the CrossPad product line....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company also described a revenue recognition policy not disclosed earlier, which stated: \"Revenue from sales is recognized upon shipment or delivery of goods. Provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized for estimated product returns, term discounts and rebates.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aldridge, the plaintiff, brought a claim under section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b) (2000), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5 (2001), for fraud against Cross, members of its top management team, and three trusts that own a large number of shares in the company. He argues that the statements made by the company and its management during the class period were misleading in light of the company's sales and accounting practices. Specifically, Aldridge says that the company employed sales strategies, such as price protection, take backs, and channel stuffing, without disclosing them to the shareholders, or reserving for them in financial statements, as they were obligated to do. Aldridge also brought a claim under section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a) (2000), against the individual defendants and the trust defendants as \"controlling persons\" of the corporation. Aldridge argues that the trust defendants, \"[b]y reason of their ownership and ability to select two-thirds of the Board,\" and the individual defendants influenced and steered the company to engage in fraudulent conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the action on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion under the standards of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4 (2000), finding Aldridge had neither provided sufficient factual support for the allegations of fraud nor raised a strong inference of scienter. <i>Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,</i> No. 00-203ML, slip. op. at 10-15 (D.R.I. June 4, 2001). The district court, without reaching the details of the controlling person issue, also dismissed the section 20(a) claim against the individual defendants and the trust defendants because it was derivative of the dismissed section 10(b) claim. <i>Id.</i> at 15-16. The court did not reach the question of whether to certify a class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the allowance of a motion to dismiss is de novo. <i>Serabian v. Amoskeag Bank Shares, Inc.,</i> 24 F.3d 357, 361 (1st Cir.1994). The pleading standards for violations of section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 are found in the PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This circuit's seminal case on the pleading standards under the PSLRA is <i>Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc.,</i> 194 F.3d 185, 193-94 (1st Cir.1999). In <i>Greebel,</i> we held that the PSLRA did not alter this circuit's rigorous reading of the standards for pleading fraud. The plaintiff in a securities fraud action must \"specify each allegedly misleading statement or omission\" including its time, place and content. <i>Id.</i> at 193. The plaintiff must provide factual support for the claim that the statements or omissions were fraudulent, that is, facts that show exactly why the statements or omissions were misleading. <i>Id.</i> at 193-94. If the plaintiff brings his claims on information and belief, he must \"set forth the source of the information and the reasons for the belief.\" <i>Id.</i> at 194 (quoting <i>Romani v. Shearson Lehman Hutton,</i> 929 F.2d 875, 878 (1st Cir.1991)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff must also show that the inferences of scienter \"are both reasonable and `<i>strong.</i>'\" <i>Id.</i> at 195-96.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the pleading requirements under the PSLRA are strict, <i>id.</i> at 194, they do not change the standard of review for a motion to dismiss. Even under the PSLRA, the district court, on a motion to dismiss, must draw all reasonable inferences from the particular allegations in the plaintiff's favor, while at the same time requiring the plaintiff to show a strong inference of scienter. <i>Id.</i> at 201; <i>accord Helwig v. Vencor, Inc.,</i> 251 F.3d 540, 553 (6th Cir.2001) (en banc), <i>petition for cert. filed,</i> 70 U.S.L.W. 3269 (Sept. 27, 2001) (No. 01-538).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>A.

The district court faulted the complaint, however, for failing to provide factual support for the allegations of fraud. <i>Id.</i> at 10-11. The district court concluded that even if Cross made false statements or material omissions, there is no support for the proposition that the defendants knew these statements or omissions were misleading at the time they were made. It also relied on the absence of specific figures regarding which transactions were misstated and by what amounts. It was here that the court erred. The district court did not \"giv[e] plaintiff[] the benefit of all reasonable inferences\" as it should have on a motion to dismiss, <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 201, but appears to have drawn its inferences in the defendants' favor. We take the plaintiff's allegations to be true and draw inferences in the plaintiff's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aldridge's core claim is that the reported revenues and earnings in A.T. Cross's financial statements were artificially inflated, and that the statements contained omissions of material facts. Aldridge alleges that under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), with which Cross purported to comply, Cross was required to estimate a loss or range of loss and set a reserve with respect to all contingent sales that were made, including sales for which the buyer had the right to receive a credit or allowance if the price of the CrossPad declined before the buyer could resell the product (i.e., price protection). If Cross was unable to establish a reserve or estimate the loss, it was required to disclose the practices that gave rise to the contingent revenues and earnings. Aldridge alleges that the defendants knew that Cross had not sufficiently reserved for the losses that inevitably would occur when Cross was forced to honor its price protection commitments, and that their failure to disclose this to the public violated federal regulations (specifically Item 303 of the SEC's Regulation S-K) and accounting standards. <i>See</i> 17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a) (2001) (requiring that SEC filings \"provide ... information that the registrant believes to be necessary to an understanding of its financial condition\"); Accounting for Contingencies, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, &#182; 10 (Financial Accounting Standards Bd.1975); Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48, &#182; 7 (Financial Accounting Standards Bd.1981) (\"FAS 48\"). Cross has not argued that the information that was not provided in the financial statements was not material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's holding hinged on a key issue: whether, from the statements made by company officials in 1999, it could be reasonably inferred that Cross had engaged in undisclosed price protection earlier, in 1998. The district court thought not. If there was no price protection or similar practice in 1998, the district court concluded, then the company's financial statements did not contain misleading omissions. Our view is to the contrary: it is an extremely reasonable inference, from the defendants' statements in 1999, that the company had offered its customers price protection guarantees in 1998, likely to induce them to carry the new CrossPad product lines. From this, it may easily be inferred that the statements were misleading and that the defendants knew that they were misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were several statements in 1999 that support the inferences. First, in February 1999, the prices of the CrossPad products were discounted by up to 30%. A February 4 business article in the Providence Journal reported the price reductions and cited Mullins, the Director of Marketing, as saying that the company would make a profit on the CrossPads even with the price cuts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The article also reported (obviously relying on company sources and most likely on Mullins) that price cuts \"had been planned since the products were introduced.\" Mullins was quoted as saying that \"the price cuts were not related to how well the units were selling.\" Mullins said \"[w]e actually had planned it from the get go. We told the retailers to expect it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, \"from the get go\" is easily read to mean from the introduction of the new product to the market in 1998. If the price cuts were planned from early 1998, it is entirely reasonable to think that price protection for the stores selling the product was also discussed and agreed on at that time, to insulate the retailers from the inevitable price reductions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The price reductions were also discussed at Cross's April 22, 1999 conference call with analysts and investors. During that conference call Byrnes, the head of PCG, said that the price reductions were in line with the company's original strategy, but were not put into place until February 1999. President Russell Boss said that \"PCG business was down\" in the first quarter of 1999 \"because of price protections [Cross] gave retailers.\" Two other corporate officers, including Byrnes, mentioned that there was a price protection program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a possibility that the Cross officers used the term \"price protection\" in some specialized narrow sense for a right to reimbursement offered by the company to the retailers once the CrossPads had already been on the store shelves for some months. However, on this record it is just as likely, if not more likely, that Aldridge's more common definition of price protection is what was meant: \"Price protection is a retailer's or distributor's right to reimbursement in the event of post-sale price reductions.\" As Aldridge argues, \"[t]hat price protection is a right implies that it is bargained for at the time the retailer/distributor contracts to buy product from the manufacturer,\" not once the product has been on the shelves for several months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aldridge also argues that under accounting rules, booking sales subject to price protection requires adequate accounting reserves at the time of sale to offset the effects of such price protection. Otherwise, such sales should not be recognized as revenue. If a reserve is not set up &#8212; because, for example, the size of the contingencies was impossible to estimate &#8212; disclosure should be made. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 203 (discussing FAS 48).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dismissing the case, the district court referred to a statement in <i>Greebel</i> that the absence of specific identifying information as to the amount and nature of contingent sales transactions was indicative of the generality of the allegations of violations of GAAP standards such as FAS 48, and thus insufficient by itself to infer scienter. <i>Aldridge,</i> slip op. at 11 (citing <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 203-04). However, in <i>Greebel,</i> there was no evidence of statements by management indicating material undisclosed contingencies, while here there was such evidence. Further, it is reasonable to infer that in this case all customers were offered price protection as a matter of company policy. Cross itself attributed losses in early 1999 in part to its price protection program. There was therefore little need for the type of specificity discussed in <i>Greebel.</i> In <i>Greebel,</i> the argument that contingent sales were not properly accounted for under FAS 48 was made largely in service of more direct claims of warehousing and whiting out, claims which, even after discovery, lacked any factual support. Here, in contrast, there is a reasonable inference of a pattern of price protection. Further, the evidence that contingent sales were not accounted for as they should have been under FAS 48 was offered in <i>Greebel</i> as indirect evidence of scienter, and there was discounted, in the absence of particulars and other evidence of scienter. <i>Greebel</i> did not hold that a plaintiff, before discovery, must in every case allege the amount of overstatement of revenues and earnings in order to state a claim that undisclosed price protection schemes were fraudulent. 194 F.3d at 204 (relying on \"complete absence\" of particulars but refusing to hold that such information must appear in a complaint).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aldridge also attempts to support the inference that a price protection program was entered into in 1998 but not disclosed at the time with allegations of two corollary practices: take backs and channel stuffing. A \"take back\" is a promise to take back goods from customers who have been unable to sell them. In the April 22, 1999 conference call, Russell Boss specifically used the phrase \"take back.\" Again, it is reasonable to infer that a take back guarantee for the retailers of CrossPads was agreed to in 1998, because a take back agreement, just like price protection, is likely to have been part of the original bargain between Cross and its customers. No take back agreements were disclosed in the company's 1998 public statements and filings. The take back allegations therefore support Aldridge's claim that Cross engaged in undisclosed price protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Channel stuffing, in turn, was defined in <i>Greebel:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Channel stuffing\" means inducing purchasers to increase substantially their purchases before they would, in the normal course, otherwise purchase products from the company. It has the result of shifting earnings into earlier quarters, quite likely to the detriment of earnings in later quarters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">194 F.3d at 202. Aldridge's allegation is that 50% of the store placements for the CrossPad took place in the last four months of 1998 and that 36% of PCG sales occurred in the last three months of 1998. These figures might well be explained by holiday season sales. Beyond that, the second quarter 1999 Form 10-Q report stated that the 85% reduction in sales from the prior year was attributable to retailers having significantly reduced their purchases as they reduced their current inventory levels. Also, the company's expenses were higher as it administered a rebate promotion \"to reduce channel inventory at the retail level.\" This information may or may not suggest that more inventory was in the hands of the retailers than commercially warranted. \"There is nothing inherently improper in pressing for sales to be made earlier than in the normal course,\" <i>id.</i> at 202, and in this case, the channel stuffing allegations at present are neutral. After discovery, however, they may play a supporting role in buttressing the price protection inferences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company says this is a garden variety \"fraud by hindsight\" case, occasioned by the large drop in sales of CrossPad products after 1998. That characterization is off the mark. Fraud by hindsight occurs when a plaintiff \"simply contrast[s] a defendant's past optimism with less favorable actual results, and then `contend[s] that the difference must be attributable to fraud.'\" <i>Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp.,</i> 82 F.3d 1194, 1223 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting <i>DiLeo v. Ernst &amp; Young,</i> 901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir.1990)). In this case, on the other hand, Aldridge complains that the company failed to disclose certain known material information as to the contingent nature of the sales, and that Cross essentially admitted to the 1998 contingencies in 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The allegations of fraud in the complaint have sufficient factual support to survive a motion to dismiss. A closer question is whether the allegations of scienter are sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>B. Scienter</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Scienter, which is a requirement for liability under section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, is \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,</i> 425 U.S. 185, 193 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976). To win a section 10(b) case, the plaintiff must show either that the defendants consciously intended to defraud, or that they acted with a high degree of recklessness. <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 198-201.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Greebel,</i> we held that the PSLRA did not mandate a particular test to determine scienter and that this court would continue to use its case by case fact-specific approach; \"we ... analyze[] the particular facts alleged in each individual case to determine whether the allegations were sufficient to support scienter.\" 194 F.3d at 196; <i>accord City of Philadelphia v. Fleming Cos.,</i> 264 F.3d 1245, 1262-63 (10th Cir.2001) (adopting <i>Greebel's</i> fact-specific approach); <i>Helwig,</i> 251 F.3d at 551 (same). Thus, the plaintiff may combine various facts and circumstances indicating fraudulent intent to show a strong inference of scienter. As part of the mix of facts, the plaintiff may allege that the defendants had the motive (\"concrete benefits that could be realized by ... the false statements and wrongful nondisclosures\") and opportunity (\"the means and likely prospect of achieving concrete benefits by the means alleged\") to commit the fraud. <i>Novak v. Kasaks,</i> 216 F.3d 300, 307 (2d Cir.) (quoting <i>Shields v. Citytrust Bancorp, Inc.,</i> 25 F.3d 1124, 1130 (2d Cir.1994)), <i>cert denied,</i> 531 U.S. 1012, 121 S.Ct. 567, 148 L.Ed.2d 486 (2000). However, as we stated in <i>Greebel,</i> while mere allegations of motive and opportunity alone may be insufficient, together with additional factual support, evidence of motive and opportunity may establish a strong inference of scienter. 194 F.3d at 197.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating whether the inferences of scienter are strong, we agree with the Sixth Circuit's language that: \"Inferences must be reasonable and strong &#8212; but not irrefutable.... Plaintiffs need not foreclose all other characterizations of fact, as the task of weighing contrary accounts is reserved for the fact finder.\" <i>Helwig,</i> 251 F.3d at 553. The plaintiff must show that his characterization of the events and circumstances as showing scienter is highly likely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking all the facts and circumstances into consideration, the complaint survives the requirement that its pleadings raise a strong inference of scienter. First, strong inferences can be made that the company offered price protection and take back arrangements in 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> These arrangements, if they existed, were not disclosed, and that nondisclosure could hardly have been inadvertent. The company only disclosed the price protection and take back agreements in an April 1999 conference call with industry analysts and investors. Full public disclosure of the agreements only occurred in the Form 10-Q report filed on May 13, 1999. Although the company officials referred to \"price protection\" during the conference call, the report used the term \"rebates,\" which may suggest an attempt to recharacterize the events. Of course, more than mere proof that the defendants made a particular false or misleading statement is required to show scienter. <i>Geffon v. Micrion Corp.,</i> 249 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir.2001). However, the fact that the defendants published statements when they knew facts suggesting the statements were inaccurate or misleadingly incomplete is classic evidence of scienter. <i>Fl. State Bd. of Admin. v. Green Tree Fin. Corp.,</i> 270 F.3d 645, 665 (8th Cir.2001) (collecting cases from various circuit courts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, building on the reasonable inference that either or both the price protection or take back guarantees were in place in 1998, it may also be inferred that accounting standards required that a reserve be established or at least that Cross disclose the sales practices in its financial statements. This is also evidence of scienter. <i>See Geffon,</i> 249 F.3d at 35 (noting that \"accounting shenanigans\" may be evidence of scienter). There is evidence that the defendants acted with knowledge and intent when they did not account for the sales practices in the company's reports in 1998. In the Form 10-K filed by the company on March 23, 2000, after a new company president was installed, Cross disclosed for the first time after the dramatic PCG losses, a revenue recognition policy: \"Revenue from sales is recognized upon shipment or delivery of goods. Provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized for product returns, term discounts and rebates.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company argues that because it has never restated any of its financials or otherwise indicated any error in the 1998 financial statements, and because its financial statements were audited by an independent accounting firm, no inference of accounting error, and so no inference of scienter, can be drawn. We disagree. Had the 1998 financials been restated, that might well have been useful to Aldridge. However, the fact that the financial statements for the year in question were not restated does not end Aldridge's case when he has otherwise met the pleading requirements of the PSLRA. To hold otherwise would shift to accountants the responsibility that belongs to the courts. It would also allow officers and directors of corporations to exercise an unwarranted degree of control over whether they are sued, because they must agree to a restatement of the financial statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the Cross corporate officers had some particular financial incentives to load sales and earnings into 1998. Their compensation depended on the company's earnings; as Cross correctly notes, that fact alone is not and cannot be enough to establish scienter. <i>Green Tree,</i> 270 F.3d at 661; <i>Fleming Cos.,</i> 264 F.3d at 1269-70; <i>Novak,</i> 216 F.3d at 307. What makes this case different are the inferences that corporate officers understood in 1997 and 1998 that the success of the new products, and of taking the old line company into a new world, was important to their own survival and that of the company. Indeed, the complaint alleges that Russell said, \"If I can't turn the company around in one year, I won't be here.\" This gave incentive to maximize 1998 earnings in particular. When financial incentives to exaggerate earnings go far beyond the usual arrangements of compensation based on the company's earnings, they may be considered among other facts to show scienter. <i>See, e.g., Green Tree,</i> 270 F.3d at 661 (reversing trial court decision based on lack of scienter where it was reasonable to infer that defendant officer maximized his compensation by overstating earnings before his contract ran out).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More specifically, the individual defendants were the ones who set the target sales goal of $25 million, and their jobs were in jeopardy if the goals were not met. Moreover, the CrossPad product line was very important to Cross. In April 1998 the defendants were quoted as stating that the CrossPad would be the primary driver of PCG's growth. In a September 30, 1998 press release, Cross stated that the sales of PCG products made up 34% of the company's total domestic revenue. That being so, there was incentive to maximize profits in 1998 by various means. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 196 (stating that \"self-interested motivation of defendants in the form of saving their salaries or jobs\" may be evidence of scienter). As it turned out, the company President, Russell Boss, and Chairman, Bradford Boss, did resign after the disastrous first quarter 1999 results were made public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Playing lesser but supporting roles in the factual analysis, there were the additional financial incentives to management to overstate 1998 profits. The exercise price of the individual defendants' stock options was lowered in 1997, just before the introduction of the new product line. The exercise price was lowered again to match the market price in December 1998. There is no evidence that the defendants exercised their options; Aldridge's point is rather that the adjustment in price created incentives to \"boost A.T. Cross share price.\" The adjustments in the exercise price of the defendants' stock options alone are not enough to create a strong inference of scienter. But this fact is not alone here. While this case does not involve trading while in possession of material nonpublic information, which in some circumstances may be taken to support allegations of motive, <i>see, e.g., Acito v. IMCERA Grp.,</i> 47 F.3d 47, 54 (2d Cir.1995), there were sufficient other sources of financial motive that make the absence of such evidence less important here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that Aldridge's section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim survives a motion to dismiss is only that. The defendants may yet prevail once the facts of the case are further developed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C. Section 20(a) Claim</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's dismissal of the section 20(a) claim was derivative of its dismissal of the section 10(b) claim. <i>See Suna v. Bailey Corp.,</i> 107 F.3d 64, 72 (1st Cir.1997). Because there must be a primary violation for liability under section 20(a), the district court did not independently evaluate whether the claim otherwise failed. Nonetheless, we \"may affirm a district court's judgment on any grounds supported by the record.\" <i>Greenless v. Almond,</i> 277 F.3d 601, 605 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the trust defendants only, the matter is plain enough to affirm the dismissal of the section 20(a) claim against them. Section 20(a) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable under any provision of this chapter or of any rule or regulation thereunder shall also be liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as such controlled person... unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act or acts constituting the violation or cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trust defendants argue that this court should adopt a three part test for controlling person liability, under which the plaintiff must allege and prove: (1) an underlying violation by a controlled person or entity; (2) the defendants control the violator; and (3) the defendants are in a meaningful sense culpable participants in the fraud in question. <i>See SEC v. First Jersey Secs. Inc.,</i> 101 F.3d 1450, 1472 (2d Cir.1996). They correctly described a split among the circuits on whether an element of section 20(a) liability is \"culpable participation.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We do not reach that question, but rest on the \"control\" element.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To meet the control element, the alleged controlling person must not only have the general power to control the company, but must also actually exercise control over the company. <i>See Sheinkopf v. Stone,</i> 927 F.2d 1259, 1270 (1st Cir.1991) (\"For [the defendant] to be liable ... there must be `significantly probative' evidence that the [defendant] exercised, directly or indirectly, meaningful hegemony over the... venture....\") (internal citation omitted); <i>see also Harrison v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc.,</i> 974 F.2d 873, 880-881 (7th Cir.1992) (describing a similar requirement). In this case, the trust defendants have the power to elect two-thirds of the directors. But they have no direct control over the management and operations of the company. At most the evidence pled is that the trust defendants are controlling shareholders. This indicates some potential ability to control. In the absence of some indicia of the <i>exercise</i> of control over the entity primarily liable, however, that status alone is not enough. Although controlling shareholders own the majority of the shares in a company, they, like any other shareholders, should have the ability to be passive, leaving the management to the directors and officers. <i>See</i> L. Carson, <i>The Liability of Controlling Persons Under the Federal Securities Acts,</i> 72 Notre Dame L.Rev. 263, 318-19 (1997). Unless there are facts that indicate that the controlling shareholders were actively participating in the decisionmaking processes of the corporation, no controlling person liability can be imposed. In this case, no facts are pled permitting an inference that the trust defendants actually exercised control over Cross.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case will be reinstated as to the company and the individual defendants. The district court may wish to consider limiting discovery initially to key issues.

Cross Corporation, a venerable New England maker of fine pens and pencils, entered the personal electronic devices market by offering penbased computing products through its Pen Computing Group (PCG). The stars of its new line were the CrossPad and its later-introduced smaller cousin, the CrossPad XP. Cross had high hopes for its new product line and expressed those hopes publicly in September 1997 by saying it expected to report a minimum of $25 million in profitable sales for PCG in 1998. Indeed, one of Cross's officers compared its fledgling product to the highly successful Palm Pilot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reality did not keep pace with these projections. By late 1999 Cross had discontinued the product line and suffered losses that year of $24.3 million, which essentially eliminated profits from the $24.8 million in sales on the PCG products in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Michael Aldridge brought this securities action in April 2000 as a putative class action on behalf of those who purchased Cross common stock between September 17, 1997 and April 22, 1999 (the class period). An amended complaint asserts claims against the company, four officers of the company, and certain trusts which own part of Cross. The complaint alleges violations of section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b) (2000), and Rule 10b-5 under that Act, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5 (2001), against the company, the individual defendants, and the trusts. It also alleges a section 20(a) claim against the individual and trust defendants as \"controlling person[s].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a) (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On a Rule 12(b)(6) motion by the defendants, the district court dismissed the action. <i>Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,</i> No. 00-203ML (D.R.I. June 4, 2001). The court did not reach the question of whether to certify a class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reverse the dismissal of the claims against the individual defendants and the company. We find that there is sufficient factual support for the allegations of fraud and a strong inference of scienter to survive a motion to dismiss under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (PSLRA).

For over a century, Cross has been producing traditional high-end writing instruments. By the mid 1990s, sales of these products were dropping off, and the company's stock price had decreased significantly since 1990. In July 1996, Cross established a new division it called the Pen Computing Group (PCG) in an effort to \"bridge ... the worlds of traditional and electronic paper,\" to expand the company's traditional product base, and \"to return Cross to acceptable margins and earnings.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One of these PCG products was the CrossPad, unveiled in November 1997, and first shipped in March 1998. The CrossPad XP, a smaller model, was introduced to the market in October 1998. The CrossPads were electronic note pads with digital pens, with which a user wrote on a note pad atop a battery powered unit. The pens wrote on the paper in the traditional way and also recorded the pen strokes for later connection to a computer. Once the information was stored in a computer, it could be viewed, searched, and otherwise used.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a great deal of optimism about the CrossPads and their positive impact on Cross as a whole. On September 17, 1997, even before unveiling the CrossPad, Cross issued a press release announcing that the company expected at least $25 million in profitable sales from PCG in 1998. On March 23, 1998, Cross filed a 10-K report with the SEC for the fiscal year 1997, which stated: \"We look at 1998 as a year where ... our Pen Computing Group will provide its first year of significant sales and earnings.\" The bulk of PCG's business was the CrossPad product line. In an April 1998 article in <i>Value Line,</i> an investment publication, Cross's management said that sales of the CrossPad would drive PCG's growth, and predicted sales of $200 million in the year 2000. In a June 1998 article in <i>Barron's,</i> another investment publication, management predicted that CrossPad could triple the size of the company. On June 30, 1998, the Cross share price peaked for the class period at $14.25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Cross's 1998 filings with the SEC, the company continued to report significant sales growth for PCG products. In a business article dated February 4, 1999, the Providence Journal quoted Brian Mullins, the Director of Marketing for PCG, as saying that PCG's \"sales for all of 1998 did meet the Company's goal of $25 million in sales.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the earlier optimism, Cross began to lower the market's expectations beginning in early 1999. The same February 4 Providence Journal article discusses Mullins's comments on the recently announced price reductions for both the CrossPad and the CrossPad XP. He stated that the price cuts were not related to the sales of the products but were \"planned... from the get go\" and were expected by the retailers. The article paraphrases Mullins as saying that \"even with the price cuts, the company will still make a profit.\" He also said that more price cuts were expected later in the year. On March 23, 1999, the company filed its 10-K report with the SEC. The report stated the success of the CrossPad sales in 1998, but it also acknowledged the price reductions and \"greater marketing support and technical development [than] planned, which resulted in a loss for Pen Computing operations.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 22, 1999, Cross announced in a press release that the company's sales had dropped dramatically from $9 million in the first quarter of 1998 to $1.1 million in the first quarter of 1999. It also expressed its expectation that revenues from PCG would be a great deal lower in 1999 than they were in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, Cross's management held a conference call with securities analysts and investors to discuss the company's results for the first quarter of 1999. During the call, Russell Boss, President and CEO of Cross, explained that PCG sales had decreased in the first quarter \"because of price protections.\" He also mentioned \"take backs\" from customers. Robert Byrnes, President and CEO of PCG also spoke about \"price protection,\" and said that the price reductions were part of the company's original sales strategy. John Buckley, Cross's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, also acknowledged the company's price protection practices. Cross did not disclose any price protection plans or take back agreements in its public financial disclosures in 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also on April 22, Russell Boss and Bradford Boss announced that they were stepping down from their positions as CEO and executive Chairman respectively, and stepping into the positions of non-executive Chairman, and non-executive Chairman Emeritus. Immediately after the end of the class period, on April 22, 1999, the share price for Cross fell below $4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCG sales continued to decline in 1999. On May 13, 1999, the company filed a 10-Q report for the first quarter of the year and revealed for the first time in a SEC filing a \"rebate\" program it had with its customers. In a 10-Q report issued on August 13, 1999, the company reported over $8 million in losses for PCG in the second quarter of 1999, and an 85% decline in PCG sales compared to the same quarter the previous year. The company pointed to the excess inventory its customers had as a reason for the decrease in sales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the CrossPad product line was discontinued at the end of 1999 because of poor performance in the market. In a Form 10-K filed on March 23, 2000, Cross's new President and CEO discussed PCG's decline in 1999. He stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in the year [1999] it became clear that our investment[] in the Pen Computing Group ... w[as] a significant drain on the Company's financial and human resources. As a result, in the fourth quarter, the Company discontinued the CrossPad product line....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company also described a revenue recognition policy not disclosed earlier, which stated: \"Revenue from sales is recognized upon shipment or delivery of goods. Provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized for estimated product returns, term discounts and rebates.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aldridge, the plaintiff, brought a claim under section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b) (2000), and Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. &#167; 240.10b-5 (2001), for fraud against Cross, members of its top management team, and three trusts that own a large number of shares in the company. He argues that the statements made by the company and its management during the class period were misleading in light of the company's sales and accounting practices. Specifically, Aldridge says that the company employed sales strategies, such as price protection, take backs, and channel stuffing, without disclosing them to the shareholders, or reserving for them in financial statements, as they were obligated to do. Aldridge also brought a claim under section 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78t(a) (2000), against the individual defendants and the trust defendants as \"controlling persons\" of the corporation. Aldridge argues that the trust defendants, \"[b]y reason of their ownership and ability to select two-thirds of the Board,\" and the individual defendants influenced and steered the company to engage in fraudulent conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed the action on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion under the standards of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4 (2000), finding Aldridge had neither provided sufficient factual support for the allegations of fraud nor raised a strong inference of scienter. <i>Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp.,</i> No. 00-203ML, slip. op. at 10-15 (D.R.I. June 4, 2001). The district court, without reaching the details of the controlling person issue, also dismissed the section 20(a) claim against the individual defendants and the trust defendants because it was derivative of the dismissed section 10(b) claim. <i>Id.</i> at 15-16.

In <i>Greebel,</i> we held that the PSLRA did not alter this circuit's rigorous reading of the standards for pleading fraud. The plaintiff in a securities fraud action must \"specify each allegedly misleading statement or omission\" including its time, place and content. <i>Id.</i> at 193. The plaintiff must provide factual support for the claim that the statements or omissions were fraudulent, that is, facts that show exactly why the statements or omissions were misleading. <i>Id.</i> at 193-94. If the plaintiff brings his claims on information and belief, he must \"set forth the source of the information and the reasons for the belief.\" <i>Id.</i> at 194 (quoting <i>Romani v.

The district court faulted the complaint, however, for failing to provide factual support for the allegations of fraud. <i>Id.</i> at 10-11. The district court concluded that even if Cross made false statements or material omissions, there is no support for the proposition that the defendants knew these statements or omissions were misleading at the time they were made. It also relied on the absence of specific figures regarding which transactions were misstated and by what amounts. It was here that the court erred. The district court did not \"giv[e] plaintiff[] the benefit of all reasonable inferences\" as it should have on a motion to dismiss, <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 201, but appears to have drawn its inferences in the defendants' favor. We take the plaintiff's allegations to be true and draw inferences in the plaintiff's favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aldridge's core claim is that the reported revenues and earnings in A.T. Cross's financial statements were artificially inflated, and that the statements contained omissions of material facts. Aldridge alleges that under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), with which Cross purported to comply, Cross was required to estimate a loss or range of loss and set a reserve with respect to all contingent sales that were made, including sales for which the buyer had the right to receive a credit or allowance if the price of the CrossPad declined before the buyer could resell the product (i.e., price protection). If Cross was unable to establish a reserve or estimate the loss, it was required to disclose the practices that gave rise to the contingent revenues and earnings. Aldridge alleges that the defendants knew that Cross had not sufficiently reserved for the losses that inevitably would occur when Cross was forced to honor its price protection commitments, and that their failure to disclose this to the public violated federal regulations (specifically Item 303 of the SEC's Regulation S-K) and accounting standards. <i>See</i> 17 C.F.R. &#167; 229.303(a) (2001) (requiring that SEC filings \"provide ... information that the registrant believes to be necessary to an understanding of its financial condition\"); Accounting for Contingencies, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, &#182; 10 (Financial Accounting Standards Bd.1975); Revenue Recognition When Right of Return Exists, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 48, &#182; 7 (Financial Accounting Standards Bd.1981) (\"FAS 48\"). Cross has not argued that the information that was not provided in the financial statements was not material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's holding hinged on a key issue: whether, from the statements made by company officials in 1999, it could be reasonably inferred that Cross had engaged in undisclosed price protection earlier, in 1998. The district court thought not. If there was no price protection or similar practice in 1998, the district court concluded, then the company's financial statements did not contain misleading omissions. Our view is to the contrary: it is an extremely reasonable inference, from the defendants' statements in 1999, that the company had offered its customers price protection guarantees in 1998, likely to induce them to carry the new CrossPad product lines. From this, it may easily be inferred that the statements were misleading and that the defendants knew that they were misleading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There were several statements in 1999 that support the inferences. First, in February 1999, the prices of the CrossPad products were discounted by up to 30%. A February 4 business article in the Providence Journal reported the price reductions and cited Mullins, the Director of Marketing, as saying that the company would make a profit on the CrossPads even with the price cuts.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The article also reported (obviously relying on company sources and most likely on Mullins) that price cuts \"had been planned since the products were introduced.\" Mullins was quoted as saying that \"the price cuts were not related to how well the units were selling.\" Mullins said \"[w]e actually had planned it from the get go. We told the retailers to expect it.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, \"from the get go\" is easily read to mean from the introduction of the new product to the market in 1998. If the price cuts were planned from early 1998, it is entirely reasonable to think that price protection for the stores selling the product was also discussed and agreed on at that time, to insulate the retailers from the inevitable price reductions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The price reductions were also discussed at Cross's April 22, 1999 conference call with analysts and investors. During that conference call Byrnes, the head of PCG, said that the price reductions were in line with the company's original strategy, but were not put into place until February 1999. President Russell Boss said that \"PCG business was down\" in the first quarter of 1999 \"because of price protections [Cross] gave retailers.\" Two other corporate officers, including Byrnes, mentioned that there was a price protection program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a possibility that the Cross officers used the term \"price protection\" in some specialized narrow sense for a right to reimbursement offered by the company to the retailers once the CrossPads had already been on the store shelves for some months. However, on this record it is just as likely, if not more likely, that Aldridge's more common definition of price protection is what was meant: \"Price protection is a retailer's or distributor's right to reimbursement in the event of post-sale price reductions.\" As Aldridge argues, \"[t]hat price protection is a right implies that it is bargained for at the time the retailer/distributor contracts to buy product from the manufacturer,\" not once the product has been on the shelves for several months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aldridge also argues that under accounting rules, booking sales subject to price protection requires adequate accounting reserves at the time of sale to offset the effects of such price protection. Otherwise, such sales should not be recognized as revenue. If a reserve is not set up &#8212; because, for example, the size of the contingencies was impossible to estimate &#8212; disclosure should be made. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 203 (discussing FAS 48).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In dismissing the case, the district court referred to a statement in <i>Greebel</i> that the absence of specific identifying information as to the amount and nature of contingent sales transactions was indicative of the generality of the allegations of violations of GAAP standards such as FAS 48, and thus insufficient by itself to infer scienter. <i>Aldridge,</i> slip op. at 11 (citing <i>Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 203-04). However, in <i>Greebel,</i> there was no evidence of statements by management indicating material undisclosed contingencies, while here there was such evidence. Further, it is reasonable to infer that in this case all customers were offered price protection as a matter of company policy. Cross itself attributed losses in early 1999 in part to its price protection program. There was therefore little need for the type of specificity discussed in <i>Greebel.</i> In <i>Greebel,</i> the argument that contingent sales were not properly accounted for under FAS 48 was made largely in service of more direct claims of warehousing and whiting out, claims which, even after discovery, lacked any factual support. Here, in contrast, there is a reasonable inference of a pattern of price protection. Further, the evidence that contingent sales were not accounted for as they should have been under FAS 48 was offered in <i>Greebel</i> as indirect evidence of scienter, and there was discounted, in the absence of particulars and other evidence of scienter. <i>Greebel</i> did not hold that a plaintiff, before discovery, must in every case allege the amount of overstatement of revenues and earnings in order to state a claim that undisclosed price protection schemes were fraudulent. 194 F.3d at 204 (relying on \"complete absence\" of particulars but refusing to hold that such information must appear in a complaint).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aldridge also attempts to support the inference that a price protection program was entered into in 1998 but not disclosed at the time with allegations of two corollary practices: take backs and channel stuffing. A \"take back\" is a promise to take back goods from customers who have been unable to sell them. In the April 22, 1999 conference call, Russell Boss specifically used the phrase \"take back.\" Again, it is reasonable to infer that a take back guarantee for the retailers of CrossPads was agreed to in 1998, because a take back agreement, just like price protection, is likely to have been part of the original bargain between Cross and its customers. No take back agreements were disclosed in the company's 1998 public statements and filings. The take back allegations therefore support Aldridge's claim that Cross engaged in undisclosed price protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Channel stuffing, in turn, was defined in <i>Greebel:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Channel stuffing\" means inducing purchasers to increase substantially their purchases before they would, in the normal course, otherwise purchase products from the company. It has the result of shifting earnings into earlier quarters, quite likely to the detriment of earnings in later quarters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">194 F.3d at 202. Aldridge's allegation is that 50% of the store placements for the CrossPad took place in the last four months of 1998 and that 36% of PCG sales occurred in the last three months of 1998. These figures might well be explained by holiday season sales. Beyond that, the second quarter 1999 Form 10-Q report stated that the 85% reduction in sales from the prior year was attributable to retailers having significantly reduced their purchases as they reduced their current inventory levels. Also, the company's expenses were higher as it administered a rebate promotion \"to reduce channel inventory at the retail level.\" This information may or may not suggest that more inventory was in the hands of the retailers than commercially warranted. \"There is nothing inherently improper in pressing for sales to be made earlier than in the normal course,\" <i>id.</i> at 202, and in this case, the channel stuffing allegations at present are neutral. After discovery, however, they may play a supporting role in buttressing the price protection inferences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company says this is a garden variety \"fraud by hindsight\" case, occasioned by the large drop in sales of CrossPad products after 1998. That characterization is off the mark.

Thus, the plaintiff may combine various facts and circumstances indicating fraudulent intent to show a strong inference of scienter. As part of the mix of facts, the plaintiff may allege that the defendants had the motive (\"concrete benefits that could be realized by ... the false statements and wrongful nondisclosures\") and opportunity (\"the means and likely prospect of achieving concrete benefits by the means alleged\") to commit the fraud. <i>Novak v.

However, as we stated in <i>Greebel,</i> while mere allegations of motive and opportunity alone may be insufficient, together with additional factual support, evidence of motive and opportunity may establish a strong inference of scienter. 194 F.3d at 197.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating whether the inferences of scienter are strong, we agree with the Sixth Circuit's language that: \"Inferences must be reasonable and strong &#8212; but not irrefutable.... Plaintiffs need not foreclose all other characterizations of fact, as the task of weighing contrary accounts is reserved for the fact finder.\" <i>Helwig,</i> 251 F.3d at 553.

First, strong inferences can be made that the company offered price protection and take back arrangements in 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> These arrangements, if they existed, were not disclosed, and that nondisclosure could hardly have been inadvertent. The company only disclosed the price protection and take back agreements in an April 1999 conference call with industry analysts and investors. Full public disclosure of the agreements only occurred in the Form 10-Q report filed on May 13, 1999. Although the company officials referred to \"price protection\" during the conference call, the report used the term \"rebates,\" which may suggest an attempt to recharacterize the events. Of course, more than mere proof that the defendants made a particular false or misleading statement is required to show scienter. <i>Geffon v. Micrion Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199400\"><a href=\"/opinion/199400/geffon-v-micrion-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.2001). However, the fact that the defendants published statements when they knew facts suggesting the statements were inaccurate or misleadingly incomplete is classic evidence of scienter. <i>Fl. State Bd. of Admin. v. Green Tree Fin. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775458\"><a href=\"/opinion/775458/florida-state-board-of-administration-v-green-tree-financial-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></a></span>, 665 (8th Cir.2001) (collecting cases from various circuit courts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, building on the reasonable inference that either or both the price protection or take back guarantees were in place in 1998, it may also be inferred that accounting standards required that a reserve be established or at least that Cross disclose the sales practices in its financial statements. This is also evidence of scienter. <i>See Geffon,</i> 249 F.3d at 35 (noting that \"accounting shenanigans\" may be evidence of scienter). There is evidence that the defendants acted with knowledge and intent when they did not account for the sales practices in the company's reports in 1998. In the Form 10-K filed by the company on March 23, 2000, after a new company president was installed, Cross disclosed for the first time after the dramatic PCG losses, a revenue recognition policy: \"Revenue from sales is recognized upon shipment or delivery of goods. Provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized for product returns, term discounts and rebates.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The company argues that because it has never restated any of its financials or otherwise indicated any error in the 1998 financial statements, and because its financial statements were audited by an independent accounting firm, no inference of accounting error, and so no inference of scienter, can be drawn. We disagree. Had the 1998 financials been restated, that might well have been useful to Aldridge. However, the fact that the financial statements for the year in question were not restated does not end Aldridge's case when he has otherwise met the pleading requirements of the PSLRA. To hold otherwise would shift to accountants the responsibility that belongs to the courts. It would also allow officers and directors of corporations to exercise an unwarranted degree of control over whether they are sued, because they must agree to a restatement of the financial statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the Cross corporate officers had some particular financial incentives to load sales and earnings into 1998. Their compensation depended on the company's earnings; as Cross correctly notes, that fact alone is not and cannot be enough to establish scienter. <i>Green Tree,</i> 270 F.3d at 661; <i>Fleming Cos.,</i> 264 F.3d at 1269-70; <i>Novak,</i> 216 F.3d at 307. What makes this case different are the inferences that corporate officers understood in 1997 and 1998 that the success of the new products, and of taking the old line company into a new world, was important to their own survival and that of the company. Indeed, the complaint alleges that Russell said, \"If I can't turn the company around in one year, I won't be here.\" This gave incentive to maximize 1998 earnings in particular. When financial incentives to exaggerate earnings go far beyond the usual arrangements of compensation based on the company's earnings, they may be considered among other facts to show scienter. <i>See, e.g., Green Tree,</i> 270 F.3d at 661 (reversing trial court decision based on lack of scienter where it was reasonable to infer that defendant officer maximized his compensation by overstating earnings before his contract ran out).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More specifically, the individual defendants were the ones who set the target sales goal of $25 million, and their jobs were in jeopardy if the goals were not met. Moreover, the CrossPad product line was very important to Cross. In April 1998 the defendants were quoted as stating that the CrossPad would be the primary driver of PCG's growth. In a September 30, 1998 press release, Cross stated that the sales of PCG products made up 34% of the company's total domestic revenue. That being so, there was incentive to maximize profits in 1998 by various means. <i>See Greebel,</i> 194 F.3d at 196 (stating that \"self-interested motivation of defendants in the form of saving their salaries or jobs\" may be evidence of scienter). As it turned out, the company President, Russell Boss, and Chairman, Bradford Boss, did resign after the disastrous first quarter 1999 results were made public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Playing lesser but supporting roles in the factual analysis, there were the additional financial incentives to management to overstate 1998 profits. The exercise price of the individual defendants' stock options was lowered in 1997, just before the introduction of the new product line. The exercise price was lowered again to match the market price in December 1998. There is no evidence that the defendants exercised their options; Aldridge's point is rather that the adjustment in price created incentives to \"boost A.T. Cross share price.\" The adjustments in the exercise price of the defendants' stock options alone are not enough to create a strong inference of scienter. But this fact is not alone here. While this case does not involve trading while in possession of material nonpublic information, which in some circumstances may be taken to support allegations of motive, <i>see, e.g., Acito v. IMCERA Grp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"688719\"><a href=\"/opinion/688719/thomas-e-acito-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 54 (2d Cir.1995), there were sufficient other sources of financial motive that make the absence of such evidence less important here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that Aldridge's section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim survives a motion to dismiss is only that. The defendants may yet prevail once the facts of the case are further developed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>C.

In this case, the trust defendants have the power to elect two-thirds of the directors. But they have no direct control over the management and operations of the company. At most the evidence pled is that the trust defendants are controlling shareholders. This indicates some potential ability to control. In the absence of some indicia of the <i>exercise</i> of control over the entity primarily liable, however, that status alone is not enough. Although controlling shareholders own the majority of the shares in a company, they, like any other shareholders, should have the ability to be passive, leaving the management to the directors and officers. <i>See</i> L. Carson, <i>The Liability of Controlling Persons Under the Federal Securities Acts,</i> 72 Notre Dame L.Rev. 263, 318-19 (1997). Unless there are facts that indicate that the controlling shareholders were actively participating in the decisionmaking processes of the corporation, no controlling person liability can be imposed.
