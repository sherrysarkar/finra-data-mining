Robert  Sacramona, the plaintiff\r                                      \r\n\nin this  diversity action, appeals from  the district court's\r\n\ngrant of summary judgment against him.  His claims arose from\r\n\nan accident that occurred when Sacramona sought to mount  and\r\n\ninflate     a     tire     manufactured      by     defendant\r\n\nBridgestone/Firestone,  Inc.  on   a  wheel  manufactured  by\r\n\ndefendant, The  Budd Company.   The  appeal is essentially  a\r\n\nchallenge to the district  court's rulings on the destruction\r\n\nor  loss   of  evidence   and  resulting  prejudice   to  the\r\n\ndefendants.\r\n\n     The facts  are as follows.   On May 4, 1988,  a customer\r\n\ndrove his van into  the Economy Mobil gas station  for repair\r\n\nof  a leaking  tire.  Sacramona,  the station's  new manager,\r\n\nremoved the  tire and decided  to replace rather  than repair\r\n\nit.   Because  the station  did not  have an  appropriate new\r\n\ntire,  Sacramona selected a used, 16-inch tire from a rack of\r\n\ntires at  the station  as a temporary  replacement, intending\r\n\nlater to get a new tire for the customer.\r\n\n     The replacement tire  bore warnings  that it  was to  be\r\n\nused only  with a  16-inch wheel.   Sacramona later  admitted\r\n\nthat he did not check the  diameter of the wheel rim; he said\r\n\nthat he chose a 16-inch tire because the tire that he removed\r\n\nwas  also 16 inches.  But the replacement tire apparently did\r\n\nnot fit  the  wheel,  which  Sacramona now  says  was  16-1/2\r\n\ninches.  After Sacramona struggled to mount the tire--using a\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\ntire mounting machine and lubricant, striking the tire with a\r\n\nhammer,  and bouncing  it on  the ground--the  tire allegedly\r\n\nexploded as  he again  attempted to  inflate it,  causing him\r\n\nnumerous injuries.\r\n\n     Sacramona  was  taken  to  the  hospital  by  ambulance.\r\n\nAnother service station employee  put the damaged replacement\r\n\ntire  on the  wheel without  inflating it,  and  the customer\r\n\ndrove  back home  very slowly  on the  uninflated tire.   The\r\n\ncustomer subsequently had the  wheel and damaged tire removed\r\n\nfrom his van and  left them unprotected in his  outdoor yard.\r\n\nIn August  1988, Sacramona's  attorney obtained the  tire and\r\n\nwheel.\r\n\n     Around February 1, 1989, the attorney gave both the tire\r\n\nand wheel to an expert consulting engineer, Dyer Carroll, who\r\n\nexamined  them and  then sent  them to  Sacramona's liability\r\n\nexpert,  Dr.  Alan Milner,  on September  30,  1991.   In the\r\n\nmeantime,  on May 3,  1991, Sacramona filed  his complaint in\r\n\nthis  case,   one  day  before  the   three-year  statute  of\r\n\nlimitations expired, asserting tort and warranty claims.  His\r\n\nis  theory is this:   that the automotive  industry knew that\r\n\nthere was a risk  of harm from mismatching tires  and wheels,\r\n\nand  that the wheel, tire, or both could have been designed--\r\n\nover and above the  warnings on the tire--to reduce  the risk\r\n\nthat such a dangerous mismatch would occur.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     By the time of  the lawsuit, the Mobil station  had been\r\n\nsold  and  many of  its  contents  were  gone, including  the\r\n\noriginal  leaking tire,  the  mounting machine,  and  various\r\n\nsafety  or equipment  manuals  and documents.   In  addition,\r\n\nduring  his  deposition,  Milner  said  that  the  wheel  had\r\n\nundergone a  \"somewhat destructive\"  examination and  that he\r\n\nunderstood from Sacramona's lawyer that Carroll had conducted\r\n\nan extensive cleaning of  the wheel.  It was  thus impossible\r\n\nto check for markings on  the inside of the wheel that  might\r\n\nhave  revealed whether  (as  Sacramona claimed)  the original\r\n\nleaking  tire had been a  16-inch tire mismatched  with a 16-\r\n\n1/2-inch wheel.\r\n\n     After   discovery,  the  defendants  moved  for  summary\r\n\njudgment  on  several  grounds,  asserting  inter  alia  that\r                                                                   \r\n\ncritical  evidence had been destroyed in  the cleaning of the\r\n\nwheel.   In opposition, Sacramona attached  a brief affidavit\r\n\nfrom Carroll  denying that  he had destroyed  such evidence.1\r\n\nThe district court ruled that evidence of the wheel should be\r\n\nexcluded,  finding  that   defendants'  \"experts  have   been\r\n\ndeprived  of the  opportunity to  examine relevant,  possibly\r\n\ndispositive evidence  before its  material alteration.\"   The\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1Carroll's  own  deposition  testimony,  apparently  not\r\ncalled  to  the district  court's  attention  at this  stage,\r\nrevealed  that Carroll's son had assisted in the cleaning but\r\ndenied that anyone had destroyed evidence.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ntrial judge treated  the wheel's exclusion  as fatal to  both\r\n\nthe negligence and warranty claims.\r\n\n     The district court also  granted summary judgment to the\r\n\ndefendants on Sacramona's  warranty claims on  an independent\r\n\nground.  Sacramona  had not notified Firestone  of his claims\r\n\nuntil  three years after the  accident; and Budd  did not get\r\n\nnotice for three more months (service of the complaint having\r\n\nbeen delayed).  The district court ruled  that the defendants\r\n\nhad been prejudiced by  this delay because evidence had  been\r\n\nlost, and that the  warranty claims were therefore  barred by\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 106,   2-318.\r\n\n     Sacramona  has now  appealed, challenging  both rulings:\r\n\nthe dismissal of both  claims because of damage to  the wheel\r\n\nand  the  dismissal of  the  warranty  claim for  prejudicial\r\n\ndelay.   We address each asserted error in turn, applying the\r\n\nstandard  of  review fitting  the  specific  issue.   Broadly\r\n\nspeaking, propositions of law  are examined de novo, findings\r                                                               \r\n\nof fact are reviewed under the clear error standard, and most\r\n\nremaining issues  (e.g., applying  multiple factors to  known\r                                   \r\n\nfacts)  are tested for \"abuse of discretion.\"   See generally\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v.

Under  settled  authority, the  district court  has\r\n\ninherent power  to exclude evidence that  has been improperly\r\n\naltered  or damaged by a party where necessary to prevent the\r\n\nnon-offending  side from suffering unfair prejudice.

Chrysler  Motor Corp.,  141\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.R.D.  362, 365 &amp; n.13 (D. Mass. 1991).  Although deterrence\r\n\nmay play a role, the primary aim is remedial, at least absent\r\n\nwillful  destruction.   This  power is  a  companion to,  but\r\n\nsomewhat different in effect  from, the doctrine that permits\r\n\nan adverse inference from one side's destruction of evidence.\r\n\n22  C. Wright &amp;  K. Graham,  Federal Practice  and Procedure:\r                                                                         \r\n\nEvidence   5178, at 153-59 (1978).\r                    \r\n\n     Sacramona's first argument against the exclusion of  the\r\n\nwheel on grounds  of prejudicial damage is that  the district\r\n\ncourt \"did not weigh the evidence in the light most favorable\r\n\nto the  non-moving plaintiff\" and therefore the  issue had to\r\n\nbe  submitted to  the jury.   Sacramona  says that  a factual\r\n\ndispute  exists  as  to  whether any  such  damage  occurred,\r\n\n\"particularly in  light of the sworn  deposition testimony of\r\n\nDyer  E. Carroll, . . .  who stated that he never scraped any\r\n\nevidence  from the  wheel  or cleaned  it  with any  abrasive\r\n\nmaterial.\"\r\n\n     The  request for a jury rests on a misunderstanding.  It\r\n\nis  familiar  law  that   the  district  judge  decides  most\r\n\npreliminary  factual  issues that  arise  in  determining the\r\n\nadmissibility of evidence.   Fed. R. Evid. 104(a).   The main\r\n\nexception  is that  under  Fed. R.  Evid.  104(b), issues  of\r\n\nconditional relevance  are normally  submitted  to the  jury.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nSacramona  invokes the  latter rule,  arguing that  the issue\r\n\nwhether  the  wheel   had  been  damaged  was  an   issue  of\r\n\nconditional relevance that should  have been submitted to the\r\n\njury.    \r\n\n     The  district  court  said  that  the  wheel  was  being\r\n\nexcluded,  in the alternative, both as  a sanction for damage\r\n\nto it and because the damage made the wheel irrelevant.   But\r\n\nin fact  the  alleged damage  to  the wheel's  inner  surface\r\n\nmerely prevented  one possible use of the wheel--to show that\r\n\nthe original  tire was or was  not 16 inches.   The wheel, or\r\n\ntestimony about  it, remained  relevant to prove  whether the\r\n\nwheel  itself  was  16-1/2  inches, which  was  one  critical\r\n\npremise of Sacramona's mismatch theory.  Thus, the only basis\r\n\nfor exclusion of  the wheel was prejudicial  damage, an issue\r\n\nthat Rule 104(a) reserves to the trial judge.\r\n\n     There  is  more  force  to Sacramona's  claim  that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court may have  erred in deciding  that Carroll had\r\n\ncleaned  the wheel.    In moving  for  summary judgment,  the\r\n\ndefendants relied upon several different admissions by Milner\r\n\nin  his deposition,  adding up  to the  following:   that the\r\n\ninside  of   the  wheel   had  been  cleaned,   removing  the\r\n\npossibility of recovering  useful evidence; that  Sacramona's\r\n\ncounsel had identified Carroll as the source of the cleaning;\r\n\nand that Milner had sought to obtain photographs of the wheel\r\n\nprior to cleaning but none had been taken by Carroll.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n      In  opposition,  Sacramona   countered  with  a   brief\r\n\naffidavit  of Carroll that he had not cleaned any substantial\r\n\nportion of the inside of the wheel.  Sacramona argued on this\r\n\nbasis (mistakenly) that the issue was one for the jury.   But\r\n\nin any event the affidavit was not much of an answer:  Milner\r\n\nsaid  that  the inside  of the  wheel  had been  cleaned; and\r\n\nwhether  or not Carroll had done it, the wheel had admittedly\r\n\nbeen in the custody  of the plaintiff's counsel or one of his\r\n\nexperts since it was recovered from the customer's backyard.\r\n\n     It  is thus  not entirely  surprising that  the district\r\n\ncourt  ruled  that  the  plaintiff was  responsible  for  the\r\n\ndamage.  At this  point, Sacramona offered new evidence:   on\r\n\nhis motion for reconsideration, a new affidavit was filed  by\r\n\nMilner, saying  that he  had been  misunderstood and  had not\r\n\ntestified  that the  inside  of the  wheel had  been cleaned.\r\n\nSacramona's counsel also filed an affidavit, which generously\r\n\ncould be read to assert that his law firm had given the wheel\r\n\nto Carroll and retrieved it unaltered.\r\n\n     But Milner's affidavit did not squarely dispute that the\r\n\nwheel  had been cleaned; and in denying that Carroll had done\r\n\nthe cleaning, the Milner  affidavit squarely contradicted his\r\n\nown prior  deposition without explanation.   As for counsel's\r\n\naffidavit,  it made  no effort  to deny  or explain  Milner's\r\n\ndeposition  testimony  that  counsel  had  told  Milner  that\r                                                \r\n\nCarroll  had cleaned  the wheel.   Taking  the matter  on the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\ndeposition testimony  and affidavits, we are  not prepared to\r\n\nrule that the district court's finding of damage by plaintiff\r\n\nwas clear error.\r\n\n     In  our  view, it  would have  been  sounder to  hold an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing on the issue of damage and responsibility\r\n\nfor it, at least when on reconsideration it became clear that\r\n\nthe issue was murky.  If at this stage Sacramona had squarely\r\n\nrequested such a hearing, it might well have been an abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion to deny it.  See General Contracting &amp; Trading Co.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Interpole, Inc., 899  F.2d 109, 115 (1st Cir.  1990).  But\r                              \r\n\nthere is no  single mode of resolving factual  disputes under\r\n\nRule  104(a),  and  we  will  not  ordinarily  reverse  on  a\r\n\nprocedural objection  never made.  Aoude v.  Mobil Oil Corp.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n892 F.2d 1115, 1120 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\n\n     Sacramona's  next  argument   is  that   if  there   was\r\n\ndestruction, it was  not done  in bad faith.   Certainly  bad\r\n\nfaith  is a  proper and  important consideration  in deciding\r\n\nwhether  and  how  to   sanction  conduct  resulting  in  the\r\n\ndestruction of evidence.  But bad faith is not essential.  If\r\n\nsuch  evidence is  mishandled through  carelessness, and  the\r\n\nother side is prejudiced, we think that the district court is\r\n\nentitled  to consider imposing sanctions, including exclusion\r\n\nof the evidence.  See Nation-Wide Check Corp., Inc. v. Forest\r                                                                         \r\n\nHills  Distrib., Inc.,  692  F.2d 214,  219 (1st  Cir. 1982);\r                                 \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nUnigard, 982  F.2d at 368  n.2; Headley, 141 F.R.D.  at 365 &amp;\r                                                   \r\n\nnn. 13-14.\r\n\n     Less need  be said about Sacramona's  further claim that\r\n\nany  evidence lost from damage to the wheel was evidence that\r\n\ncould only have favored the plaintiff.  Yes, if the wheel had\r\n\nbeen  undamaged, it  might have  helped Sacramona  by showing\r\n\nmarks  indicating that the original  leaking tire had been 16\r\n\ninches.  But the absence of such marks, had the tire not been\r\n\ncleaned, would  have helped the defendants  by suggesting the\r\n\nopposite.   Plainly, this is not  a case in which  we can say\r\n\nthat the lost evidence could only have helped Sacramona.\r\n\n     2.  Sacramona's final argument addressed to the sanction\r\n\npresents a quite  different and more  troubling concern.   In\r\n\nSacramona's  petition for  reconsideration, he  argued (among\r\n\nmany other  points) that a proportionate  sanction for damage\r\n\nto the wheel would merely prevent Sacramona from arguing that\r\n\nthe original tire was  16 inches.  He also asserted  that his\r\n\ndesign defect  claim remained viable, even if no 16-inch tire\r\n\nhad been on the  wheel when it was  brought into the  service\r\n\nstation.  \r\n\n     The defendants' response in  the district court, renewed\r\n\non  appeal,  is  that  Sacramona's theory  of  design  defect\r\n\ndepends  on a showing that  the injury in  this case resulted\r\n\nfrom  an attempt  to place  a 16-inch  tire on  a 16-1/2-inch\r\n\nwheel.  And, say  the defendants, the exclusion of  the wheel\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n(as a sanction for damaging the evidence) also should prevent\r\n\nany proof  that the wheel was 16-1/2 inches.  In the district\r\n\ncourt's own words at the time of its original ruling:\r\n\n     As  a  result of  this  exclusion  [of the  wheel],\r\n     plaintiff will be unable to produce any evidence or\r\n     testimony that  a 16.5  inch wheel was  involved in\r\n     the  accident or  that it  was defective.   Because\r\n     Sacramona's  claim is  premised  entirely upon  his\r\n     unprovable allegation  that a 16-inch  tire was  in\r\n     dynamic service with a 16.5-inch wheel, there is no\r\n     genuine   issue  of   material   fact  to   support\r\n     Sacramona's    allegations    and,    consequently,\r\n     defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\r\n\n     The problem with this  reasoning, as we see it,  is that\r\n\nit gives the defendants a sanction that goes well beyond what\r\n\nis  necessary to cure the  prejudice.  Accepting the district\r\n\ncourt's  finding  of damage  by  plaintiffs  to the  interior\r\n\nsurface  of  the  wheel,  the  defendants  were prejudicially\r\n\nhindered in rebutting Sacramona's claim that he had removed a\r\n\n16-inch tire from  the wheel.  A commensurate  sanction might\r\n\nhave included  an order barring Sacramona  from claiming that\r\n\nthe original tire was 16 inches.\r\n\n     But  neither  the  district  court  nor  the  defendants\r\n\nexplain  why any broader sanction was needed to undo the harm\r\n\ncaused  by  the wheel's  cleaning.   In  fact,  one defendant\r\n\napparently  urged  the   more  limited   sanction--precluding\r\n\nSacramona's claim that the original tire was 16 inches--as an\r\n\nalternative to dismissal.   And there is no finding  that the\r\n\ndamage was  willfully intended  to deprive the  defendants of\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nhelpful evidence, arguably a  basis for a sanction  that does\r\n\nmore than undo the harm.\r\n\n     Nevertheless, a narrowing of the sanction would not have\r\n\nsaved  the negligence  claim against  the defendants.   Under\r\n\nMassachusetts law, contributory negligence by the victim is a\r\n\nbar to any recovery if it represents  more than 50 percent of\r\n\nthe total negligence on both sides.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231,\r\n\n  85.   Whether or not the wheel or tire might have been more\r\n\nsafely  designed,  it  would  be  patent  negligence  by  the\r\n\nplaintiff to select a  16-inch tire as a  replacement without\r\n\nsome good reason to think that the wheel was also 16 inches.\r\n\n     Sacramona's only  asserted basis  for selecting the  16-\r\n\ninch  replacement was  that the leaking  tire taken  from the\r\n\nwheel was a  16-inch tire, presumably based  on its labeling.\r\n\nIf Sacramona were precluded from making that claim, a finding\r\n\nof  serious negligence  on Sacramona's  part could  hardly be\r\n\navoided.    Indeed,  Sacramona  would  appear  to  be  doubly\r\n\nnegligent:  first in  selecting the 16-inch tire without  any\r\n\nbasis  for doing so and,  second, in his  repeated efforts to\r\n\nseat and  inflate  the tire  even  when failure  showed  that\r\n\nsomething was wrong.  Thus, even if the sanction were limited\r\n\nas Sacramona suggests, his negligence claim would still fail.\r\n\nWe therefore affirm summary judgment on this claim.\r\n\n     The   more   limited   sanction,  however,   would   not\r\n\nnecessarily   preclude  the  warranty  claim.    Contributory\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                         -12-\r\r\n\nnegligence is not  an automatic defense  to a warranty  claim\r\n\nunder Massachusetts  law.   Colter v. Barber-Greene  Co., 525\r                                                                    \r\n\nN.E.2d  1305, 1313-14 (Mass. 1988).  This, in turn, brings us\r\n\nto the district court's alternative ground for dismissing the\r\n\nwarranty claim.\r\n\n     3.    Neither  side   disputes  that  Massachusetts  law\r\n\nembodies a notice  requirement for warranty  claims.  As  the\r\n\nrule has  been formulated,  a plaintiff must  give reasonably\r\n\nprompt  notice  of  his   warranty  claim  to  the  potential\r\n\ndefendant; if he fails to do so, and the defendant is thereby\r\n\nprejudiced,  the  warranty claim  is  barred  even  if it  is\r\n\nbrought within  the statute of limitations.   Although merely\r\n\nimplied by a Massachusetts statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  106,\r\n\n  2-318,  case law  has fleshed  out the  notice requirement.\r\n\nCastro v. Stanley Works,  864 F.2d 961, 963 (1st  Cir. 1989);\r                                   \r\n\nCameo  Curtains, Inc. v. Philip  Carey Corp., 416 N.E.2d 995,\r                                                        \r\n\n998 (Mass. App. Ct. 1981).\r\n\n     Whether notice  is unreasonably delayed can  be a thorny\r\n\nissue but, in this case, undue delay is obvious and Sacramona\r\n\ndoes  not  even  argue to  the  contrary.    And assuming  an\r\n\nunreasonable  delay  in  notice,  the  prejudice  showing  is\r\n\nrelatively easy:   it is enough that the delay  may well have\r\n\ndeprived  the defense  of  useful evidence.    No showing  is\r\n\nrequired that lost evidence would inevitably have altered the\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\noutcome.   Castro, 864 F.2d  at 964.   In  short, the  notice\r                             \r\n\nrequirement has real teeth.\r\n\n     The  reason  for  this  rule in  Massachusetts  is  that\r\n\nwarranty  liability  combines features  that  place potential\r\n\ndefendants  at  serious  risk:   strict  liability,  lack  of\r\n\nprivity, and a statute  of limitations that may run  not from\r\n\nthe sale but from the injury.  Cameo Curtains, 416 N.E.2d  at\r                                                         \r\n\n997.   As a  counterweight, the requirement  of prompt notice\r\n\nallows the  defendant to  gather evidence in  timely fashion;\r\n\nwithout such notice, a defendant could easily be surprised by\r\n\na lawsuit many years after selling its products.  Cf. Castro,\r                                                                        \r\n\n864 F.2d at 963.\r\n\n     In the present case, notice was plainly delayed; and the\r\n\ndistrict court  found that  the requisite prejudice  had been\r\n\nshown by the defendants.  On appeal, Sacramona  contests this\r\n\nlatter  finding   on  two  related  grounds:     first,  that\r\n\nprejudice,  in this context, is  an issue for  the jury under\r\n\nMassachusetts law;  and, second,  that the district  court in\r\n\nfinding  prejudice  resolved   disputed  issues  on   summary\r\n\njudgment without giving the  benefit of doubts and inferences\r\n\nto the non-moving party.\r\n\n     Massachusetts does  treat the  defense as a  jury issue,\r\n\nHenrick v.  Coats Co.,  Inc., 458  N.E.2d 773,  774-75 (Mass.\r                                        \r\n\nApp.  Ct. 1984),  and--regardless  of whether  this  practice\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                         -14-\r\r\n\nwould be binding on a federal court2--we ourselves treat as a\r\n\njury  issue  fact  questions   presented  by  a  statutes  of\r\n\nlimitation defense, Villarini-Garcia v. Hospital Del Maestro,\r                                                                         \r\n\nInc., 8 F.3d 81, 84 (1st Cir. 1993), which offers  an analogy\r                \r\n\nto the notice requirement.   But the question remains whether\r\n\na reasonable  jury would still  have been  compelled to  find\r\n\nprejudice here.\r\n\n     We review such determinations de novo, assuming that the\r                                                      \r\n\njury would  credit the non-movant's version of events.  E.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nContinental Ins. Co. v.  Arkwright Mutual Ins. Co.,  102 F.3d\r                                                              \r\n\n30, 33 n.4 (1st Cir. 1996).  Yet, even if the jury found that\r\n\nCarroll had not  caused prejudicial damage to  the wheel, the\r\n\nloss  of the remaining evidence would be beyond dispute:  the\r\n\noriginal  leaking tire,  the other  wheels and  tires on  the\r\n\ncustomer's van,  and the  equipment in the  garage, including\r\n\nthe  tire changer, the pressure gauge, and the manuals.  This\r\n\nmaterial  might have  been  salvaged if  Sacramona had  given\r\n\nprompt notice to the  defendants after the accident; instead,\r\n\nhe waited three years.\r\n\n     The original tire itself,  without more, could have been\r\n\nvery helpful evidence.  If it had proved to be 16-1/2 inches,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2The extent to which state jury practice binds a federal\r\ncourt in a diversity case  involves consideration of the Erie\r                                                                         \r\ndoctrine,  the  Rules  of   Decision  Act,  and  the  Seventh\r\nAmendment.

See Colter, 525 N.E.2d  at 1312.  Of  course, since\r                                \r\n\ncontributory  negligence is  not  a defense  to the  warranty\r\n\nclaim, the jury  would have had some  latitude.  But  to show\r\n\nprejudice based  on a lack  of notice, the  defendants needed\r\n\nonly to prove  that evidence  was lost that  might well  have\r\n\nhelped them, and that they have done. \r\n\n     In fact,  on  appeal Sacramona  makes relatively  little\r\n\neffort  to  show  how  a  jury  could  have  failed  to  find\r\n\nprejudice.    His  factual  appraisal  of  lost  evidence  is\r\n\nconfined to question  whether the wheel was  damaged; for the\r\n\nrest,  his  brief simply  asserts  that prejudice  is  a jury\r\n\nissue.  Indeed, it is--but only where a reasonable jury could\r\n\ndecide the issue either  way.  Here, given the  low threshold\r\n\nfor the  showing  and  the admitted  loss  of  evidence,  the\r\n\noutcome on this issue was inevitable.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                          \r\n\n                             -16-\r                                         -16-\r\r\n",

Robert  Sacramona, the plaintiff\r                                      \r\n\nin this  diversity action, appeals from  the district court's\r\n\ngrant of summary judgment against him.  His claims arose from\r\n\nan accident that occurred when Sacramona sought to mount  and\r\n\ninflate     a     tire     manufactured      by     defendant\r\n\nBridgestone/Firestone,  Inc.  on   a  wheel  manufactured  by\r\n\ndefendant, The  Budd Company.   The  appeal is essentially  a\r\n\nchallenge to the district  court's rulings on the destruction\r\n\nor  loss   of  evidence   and  resulting  prejudice   to  the\r\n\ndefendants.\r\n\n     The facts  are as follows.   On May 4, 1988,  a customer\r\n\ndrove his van into  the Economy Mobil gas station  for repair\r\n\nof  a leaking  tire.  Sacramona,  the station's  new manager,\r\n\nremoved the  tire and decided  to replace rather  than repair\r\n\nit.   Because  the station  did not  have an  appropriate new\r\n\ntire,  Sacramona selected a used, 16-inch tire from a rack of\r\n\ntires at  the station  as a temporary  replacement, intending\r\n\nlater to get a new tire for the customer.\r\n\n     The replacement tire  bore warnings  that it  was to  be\r\n\nused only  with a  16-inch wheel.   Sacramona later  admitted\r\n\nthat he did not check the  diameter of the wheel rim; he said\r\n\nthat he chose a 16-inch tire because the tire that he removed\r\n\nwas  also 16 inches.  But the replacement tire apparently did\r\n\nnot fit  the  wheel,  which  Sacramona now  says  was  16-1/2\r\n\ninches.  After Sacramona struggled to mount the tire--using a\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\ntire mounting machine and lubricant, striking the tire with a\r\n\nhammer,  and bouncing  it on  the ground--the  tire allegedly\r\n\nexploded as  he again  attempted to  inflate it,  causing him\r\n\nnumerous injuries.\r\n\n     Sacramona  was  taken  to  the  hospital  by  ambulance.\r\n\nAnother service station employee  put the damaged replacement\r\n\ntire  on the  wheel without  inflating it,  and  the customer\r\n\ndrove  back home  very slowly  on the  uninflated tire.   The\r\n\ncustomer subsequently had the  wheel and damaged tire removed\r\n\nfrom his van and  left them unprotected in his  outdoor yard.\r\n\nIn August  1988, Sacramona's  attorney obtained the  tire and\r\n\nwheel.\r\n\n     Around February 1, 1989, the attorney gave both the tire\r\n\nand wheel to an expert consulting engineer, Dyer Carroll, who\r\n\nexamined  them and  then sent  them to  Sacramona's liability\r\n\nexpert,  Dr.  Alan Milner,  on September  30,  1991.   In the\r\n\nmeantime,  on May 3,  1991, Sacramona filed  his complaint in\r\n\nthis  case,   one  day  before  the   three-year  statute  of\r\n\nlimitations expired, asserting tort and warranty claims.  His\r\n\nis  theory is this:   that the automotive  industry knew that\r\n\nthere was a risk  of harm from mismatching tires  and wheels,\r\n\nand  that the wheel, tire, or both could have been designed--\r\n\nover and above the  warnings on the tire--to reduce  the risk\r\n\nthat such a dangerous mismatch would occur.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     By the time of  the lawsuit, the Mobil station  had been\r\n\nsold  and  many of  its  contents  were  gone, including  the\r\n\noriginal  leaking tire,  the  mounting machine,  and  various\r\n\nsafety  or equipment  manuals  and documents.   In  addition,\r\n\nduring  his  deposition,  Milner  said  that  the  wheel  had\r\n\nundergone a  \"somewhat destructive\"  examination and  that he\r\n\nunderstood from Sacramona's lawyer that Carroll had conducted\r\n\nan extensive cleaning of  the wheel.  It was  thus impossible\r\n\nto check for markings on  the inside of the wheel that  might\r\n\nhave  revealed whether  (as  Sacramona claimed)  the original\r\n\nleaking  tire had been a  16-inch tire mismatched  with a 16-\r\n\n1/2-inch wheel.\r\n\n     After   discovery,  the  defendants  moved  for  summary\r\n\njudgment  on  several  grounds,  asserting  inter  alia  that\r                                                                   \r\n\ncritical  evidence had been destroyed in  the cleaning of the\r\n\nwheel.   In opposition, Sacramona attached  a brief affidavit\r\n\nfrom Carroll  denying that  he had destroyed  such evidence.1\r\n\nThe district court ruled that evidence of the wheel should be\r\n\nexcluded,  finding  that   defendants'  \"experts  have   been\r\n\ndeprived  of the  opportunity to  examine relevant,  possibly\r\n\ndispositive evidence  before its  material alteration.\"   The\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1Carroll's  own  deposition  testimony,  apparently  not\r\ncalled  to  the district  court's  attention  at this  stage,\r\nrevealed  that Carroll's son had assisted in the cleaning but\r\ndenied that anyone had destroyed evidence.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\ntrial judge treated  the wheel's exclusion  as fatal to  both\r\n\nthe negligence and warranty claims.\r\n\n     The district court also  granted summary judgment to the\r\n\ndefendants on Sacramona's  warranty claims on  an independent\r\n\nground.  Sacramona  had not notified Firestone  of his claims\r\n\nuntil  three years after the  accident; and Budd  did not get\r\n\nnotice for three more months (service of the complaint having\r\n\nbeen delayed).  The district court ruled  that the defendants\r\n\nhad been prejudiced by  this delay because evidence had  been\r\n\nlost, and that the  warranty claims were therefore  barred by\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 106,   2-318.\r\n\n     Sacramona  has now  appealed, challenging  both rulings:\r\n\nthe dismissal of both  claims because of damage to  the wheel\r\n\nand  the  dismissal of  the  warranty  claim for  prejudicial\r\n\ndelay.

Wright &amp;  K. Graham,  Federal Practice  and Procedure:\r                                                                         \r\n\nEvidence   5178, at 153-59 (1978).\r                    \r\n\n     Sacramona's first argument against the exclusion of  the\r\n\nwheel on grounds  of prejudicial damage is that  the district\r\n\ncourt \"did not weigh the evidence in the light most favorable\r\n\nto the  non-moving plaintiff\" and therefore the  issue had to\r\n\nbe  submitted to  the jury.   Sacramona  says that  a factual\r\n\ndispute  exists  as  to  whether any  such  damage  occurred,\r\n\n\"particularly in  light of the sworn  deposition testimony of\r\n\nDyer  E. Carroll, . . .  who stated that he never scraped any\r\n\nevidence  from the  wheel  or cleaned  it  with any  abrasive\r\n\nmaterial.\"\r\n\n     The  request for a jury rests on a misunderstanding.  It\r\n\nis  familiar  law  that   the  district  judge  decides  most\r\n\npreliminary  factual  issues that  arise  in  determining the\r\n\nadmissibility of evidence.   Fed. R. Evid. 104(a).   The main\r\n\nexception  is that  under  Fed. R.  Evid.  104(b), issues  of\r\n\nconditional relevance  are normally  submitted  to the  jury.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nSacramona  invokes the  latter rule,  arguing that  the issue\r\n\nwhether  the  wheel   had  been  damaged  was  an   issue  of\r\n\nconditional relevance that should  have been submitted to the\r\n\njury.    \r\n\n     The  district  court  said  that  the  wheel  was  being\r\n\nexcluded,  in the alternative, both as  a sanction for damage\r\n\nto it and because the damage made the wheel irrelevant.   But\r\n\nin fact  the  alleged damage  to  the wheel's  inner  surface\r\n\nmerely prevented  one possible use of the wheel--to show that\r\n\nthe original  tire was or was  not 16 inches.   The wheel, or\r\n\ntestimony about  it, remained  relevant to prove  whether the\r\n\nwheel  itself  was  16-1/2  inches, which  was  one  critical\r\n\npremise of Sacramona's mismatch theory.  Thus, the only basis\r\n\nfor exclusion of  the wheel was prejudicial  damage, an issue\r\n\nthat Rule 104(a) reserves to the trial judge.\r\n\n     There  is  more  force  to Sacramona's  claim  that  the\r\n\ndistrict  court may have  erred in deciding  that Carroll had\r\n\ncleaned  the wheel.    In moving  for  summary judgment,  the\r\n\ndefendants relied upon several different admissions by Milner\r\n\nin  his deposition,  adding up  to the  following:   that the\r\n\ninside  of   the  wheel   had  been  cleaned,   removing  the\r\n\npossibility of recovering  useful evidence; that  Sacramona's\r\n\ncounsel had identified Carroll as the source of the cleaning;\r\n\nand that Milner had sought to obtain photographs of the wheel\r\n\nprior to cleaning but none had been taken by Carroll.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\n      In  opposition,  Sacramona   countered  with  a   brief\r\n\naffidavit  of Carroll that he had not cleaned any substantial\r\n\nportion of the inside of the wheel.  Sacramona argued on this\r\n\nbasis (mistakenly) that the issue was one for the jury.   But\r\n\nin any event the affidavit was not much of an answer:  Milner\r\n\nsaid  that  the inside  of the  wheel  had been  cleaned; and\r\n\nwhether  or not Carroll had done it, the wheel had admittedly\r\n\nbeen in the custody  of the plaintiff's counsel or one of his\r\n\nexperts since it was recovered from the customer's backyard.\r\n\n     It  is thus  not entirely  surprising that  the district\r\n\ncourt  ruled  that  the  plaintiff was  responsible  for  the\r\n\ndamage.  At this  point, Sacramona offered new evidence:   on\r\n\nhis motion for reconsideration, a new affidavit was filed  by\r\n\nMilner, saying  that he  had been  misunderstood and  had not\r\n\ntestified  that the  inside  of the  wheel had  been cleaned.\r\n\nSacramona's counsel also filed an affidavit, which generously\r\n\ncould be read to assert that his law firm had given the wheel\r\n\nto Carroll and retrieved it unaltered.\r\n\n     But Milner's affidavit did not squarely dispute that the\r\n\nwheel  had been cleaned; and in denying that Carroll had done\r\n\nthe cleaning, the Milner  affidavit squarely contradicted his\r\n\nown prior  deposition without explanation.   As for counsel's\r\n\naffidavit,  it made  no effort  to deny  or explain  Milner's\r\n\ndeposition  testimony  that  counsel  had  told  Milner  that\r                                                \r\n\nCarroll  had cleaned  the wheel.   Taking  the matter  on the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\ndeposition testimony  and affidavits, we are  not prepared to\r\n\nrule that the district court's finding of damage by plaintiff\r\n\nwas clear error.\r\n\n     In  our  view, it  would have  been  sounder to  hold an\r\n\nevidentiary hearing on the issue of damage and responsibility\r\n\nfor it, at least when on reconsideration it became clear that\r\n\nthe issue was murky.  If at this stage Sacramona had squarely\r\n\nrequested such a hearing, it might well have been an abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion to deny it.

Yes, if the wheel had\r\n\nbeen  undamaged, it  might have  helped Sacramona  by showing\r\n\nmarks  indicating that the original  leaking tire had been 16\r\n\ninches.  But the absence of such marks, had the tire not been\r\n\ncleaned, would  have helped the defendants  by suggesting the\r\n\nopposite.   Plainly, this is not  a case in which  we can say\r\n\nthat the lost evidence could only have helped Sacramona.\r\n\n     2.  Sacramona's final argument addressed to the sanction\r\n\npresents a quite  different and more  troubling concern.   In\r\n\nSacramona's  petition for  reconsideration, he  argued (among\r\n\nmany other  points) that a proportionate  sanction for damage\r\n\nto the wheel would merely prevent Sacramona from arguing that\r\n\nthe original tire was  16 inches.  He also asserted  that his\r\n\ndesign defect  claim remained viable, even if no 16-inch tire\r\n\nhad been on the  wheel when it was  brought into the  service\r\n\nstation.  \r\n\n     The defendants' response in  the district court, renewed\r\n\non  appeal,  is  that  Sacramona's theory  of  design  defect\r\n\ndepends  on a showing that  the injury in  this case resulted\r\n\nfrom  an attempt  to place  a 16-inch  tire on  a 16-1/2-inch\r\n\nwheel.  And, say  the defendants, the exclusion of  the wheel\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n\n(as a sanction for damaging the evidence) also should prevent\r\n\nany proof  that the wheel was 16-1/2 inches.  In the district\r\n\ncourt's own words at the time of its original ruling:\r\n\n     As  a  result of  this  exclusion  [of the  wheel],\r\n     plaintiff will be unable to produce any evidence or\r\n     testimony that  a 16.5  inch wheel was  involved in\r\n     the  accident or  that it  was defective.   Because\r\n     Sacramona's  claim is  premised  entirely upon  his\r\n     unprovable allegation  that a 16-inch  tire was  in\r\n     dynamic service with a 16.5-inch wheel, there is no\r\n     genuine   issue  of   material   fact  to   support\r\n     Sacramona's    allegations    and,    consequently,\r\n     defendants are entitled to summary judgment.\r\n\n     The problem with this  reasoning, as we see it,  is that\r\n\nit gives the defendants a sanction that goes well beyond what\r\n\nis  necessary to cure the  prejudice.  Accepting the district\r\n\ncourt's  finding  of damage  by  plaintiffs  to the  interior\r\n\nsurface  of  the  wheel,  the  defendants  were prejudicially\r\n\nhindered in rebutting Sacramona's claim that he had removed a\r\n\n16-inch tire from  the wheel.  A commensurate  sanction might\r\n\nhave included  an order barring Sacramona  from claiming that\r\n\nthe original tire was 16 inches.\r\n\n     But  neither  the  district  court  nor  the  defendants\r\n\nexplain  why any broader sanction was needed to undo the harm\r\n\ncaused  by  the wheel's  cleaning.   In  fact,  one defendant\r\n\napparently  urged  the   more  limited   sanction--precluding\r\n\nSacramona's claim that the original tire was 16 inches--as an\r\n\nalternative to dismissal.   And there is no finding  that the\r\n\ndamage was  willfully intended  to deprive the  defendants of\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                         -11-\r\r\n\nhelpful evidence, arguably a  basis for a sanction  that does\r\n\nmore than undo the harm.\r\n\n     Nevertheless, a narrowing of the sanction would not have\r\n\nsaved  the negligence  claim against  the defendants.   Under\r\n\nMassachusetts law, contributory negligence by the victim is a\r\n\nbar to any recovery if it represents  more than 50 percent of\r\n\nthe total negligence on both sides.  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231,\r\n\n  85.   Whether or not the wheel or tire might have been more\r\n\nsafely  designed,  it  would  be  patent  negligence  by  the\r\n\nplaintiff to select a  16-inch tire as a  replacement without\r\n\nsome good reason to think that the wheel was also 16 inches.\r\n\n     Sacramona's only  asserted basis  for selecting the  16-\r\n\ninch  replacement was  that the leaking  tire taken  from the\r\n\nwheel was a  16-inch tire, presumably based  on its labeling.\r\n\nIf Sacramona were precluded from making that claim, a finding\r\n\nof  serious negligence  on Sacramona's  part could  hardly be\r\n\navoided.    Indeed,  Sacramona  would  appear  to  be  doubly\r\n\nnegligent:  first in  selecting the 16-inch tire without  any\r\n\nbasis  for doing so and,  second, in his  repeated efforts to\r\n\nseat and  inflate  the tire  even  when failure  showed  that\r\n\nsomething was wrong.  Thus, even if the sanction were limited\r\n\nas Sacramona suggests, his negligence claim would still fail.\r\n\nWe therefore affirm summary judgment on this claim.\r\n\n     The   more   limited   sanction,  however,   would   not\r\n\nnecessarily   preclude  the  warranty  claim.

Neither  side   disputes  that  Massachusetts  law\r\n\nembodies a notice  requirement for warranty  claims.  As  the\r\n\nrule has  been formulated,  a plaintiff must  give reasonably\r\n\nprompt  notice  of  his   warranty  claim  to  the  potential\r\n\ndefendant; if he fails to do so, and the defendant is thereby\r\n\nprejudiced,  the  warranty claim  is  barred  even  if it  is\r\n\nbrought within  the statute of limitations.   Although merely\r\n\nimplied by a Massachusetts statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  106,\r\n\n  2-318,  case law  has fleshed  out the  notice requirement.\r\n\nCastro v.

App. Ct. 1981).\r\n\n     Whether notice  is unreasonably delayed can  be a thorny\r\n\nissue but, in this case, undue delay is obvious and Sacramona\r\n\ndoes  not  even  argue to  the  contrary.    And assuming  an\r\n\nunreasonable  delay  in  notice,  the  prejudice  showing  is\r\n\nrelatively easy:   it is enough that the delay  may well have\r\n\ndeprived  the defense  of  useful evidence.    No showing  is\r\n\nrequired that lost evidence would inevitably have altered the\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                         -13-\r\r\n\noutcome.   Castro, 864 F.2d  at 964.   In  short, the  notice\r                             \r\n\nrequirement has real teeth.\r\n\n     The  reason  for  this  rule in  Massachusetts  is  that\r\n\nwarranty  liability  combines features  that  place potential\r\n\ndefendants  at  serious  risk:   strict  liability,  lack  of\r\n\nprivity, and a statute  of limitations that may run  not from\r\n\nthe sale but from the injury.  Cameo Curtains, 416 N.E.2d  at\r                                                         \r\n\n997.   As a  counterweight, the requirement  of prompt notice\r\n\nallows the  defendant to  gather evidence in  timely fashion;\r\n\nwithout such notice, a defendant could easily be surprised by\r\n\na lawsuit many years after selling its products.  Cf. Castro,\r                                                                        \r\n\n864 F.2d at 963.\r\n\n     In the present case, notice was plainly delayed; and the\r\n\ndistrict court  found that  the requisite prejudice  had been\r\n\nshown by the defendants.  On appeal, Sacramona  contests this\r\n\nlatter  finding   on  two  related  grounds:     first,  that\r\n\nprejudice,  in this context, is  an issue for  the jury under\r\n\nMassachusetts law;  and, second,  that the district  court in\r\n\nfinding  prejudice  resolved   disputed  issues  on   summary\r\n\njudgment without giving the  benefit of doubts and inferences\r\n\nto the non-moving party.\r\n\n     Massachusetts does  treat the  defense as a  jury issue,\r\n\nHenrick v.

Of  course, since\r                                \r\n\ncontributory  negligence is  not  a defense  to the  warranty\r\n\nclaim, the jury  would have had some  latitude.  But  to show\r\n\nprejudice based  on a lack  of notice, the  defendants needed\r\n\nonly to prove  that evidence  was lost that  might well  have\r\n\nhelped them, and that they have done. \r\n\n     In fact,  on  appeal Sacramona  makes relatively  little\r\n\neffort  to  show  how  a  jury  could  have  failed  to  find\r\n\nprejudice.    His  factual  appraisal  of  lost  evidence  is\r\n\nconfined to question  whether the wheel was  damaged; for the\r\n\nrest,  his  brief simply  asserts  that prejudice  is  a jury\r\n\nissue.  Indeed, it is--but only where a reasonable jury could\r\n\ndecide the issue either  way.
