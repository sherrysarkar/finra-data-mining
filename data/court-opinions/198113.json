Francis J. Boyle, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Edward C. Roy and Roy &amp; Cook on brief for appellant.\r\n Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Ira Belkin,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nSeptember 11, 1998\r\n\n                                                Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we conclude that this appeal presents no substantial\r\nquestion and that oral argument is not warranted.  The district\r\ncourt clearly understood its authority and expressly exercised\r\nits discretion not to depart at all, in light of defendant's\r\nparticular combination of positive (assistance to the\r\ngovernment) and negative (under-represented criminal record)\r\ncircumstances.  We have no jurisdiction to review such a\r\ndiscretionary denial of a downward departure.  Accordingly, we\r\ndo not consider defendant's contention that the district\r\ncourt's analysis of the positive circumstances was\r\ninsufficiently detailed.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
