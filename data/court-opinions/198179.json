DESMOND,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n   MASSACHUSETTS BAY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY, ET AL.,\r\n\n                  Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n       [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n John F. Desmond on brief pro se.\r\n Jonathan P. Feltner, First Assistant General Counsel-Trials,\r\nand Edward P. Harrington, Assistant General Counsel, MBTA Law\r\nDepartment, on brief for appellees Massachusetts Bay Transportation\r\nAuthority, Patrick J. Moynihan, General Manager, James Clark,\r\nRobert Powers, Bob Norton, Kevin Shorter and J. Floyd.\r\n\nOCTOBER 23, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  The complaint was dismissed as a\r\nsanction for (1) plaintiff's failure to attend his deposition\r\ntwice, despite proper notice and a court order warning of\r\nsanctions in the event of a second failure, and (2) plaintiff's\r\nfailure to appear or attend a pretrial conference by telephone,\r\ndespite the grant of his request to attend the conference by\r\ntelephone.    \r\n          Having carefully reviewed the judgment below in light\r\nof the entire record and the parties' arguments on appeal, we\r\nfind no abuse of discretion in the dismissal.  Since the\r\ncomplaint was properly dismissed for abuses constituting a\r\nfailure to prosecute, plaintiff's challenges to the district\r\ncourt's interlocutory orders are not properly before us. \r\nJohn's Insulation, Inc. v. L. Addison &amp; Assocs., Inc., --- F.3d\r\n---, 1998 WL 568602 *5-*8  (1st Cir. Sept. 11, 1998).  In any\r\nevent, there was no prejudicial error in the court's careful\r\ninterlocutory rulings on each of plaintiff's largely\r\nincomprehensible motions.\r\n         Plaintiff's appellate motions, (1) \"To Quash All\r\nWarrants, Release Copies Thereof and Award Damages in the\r\nAmount of 5.5 Million Dollars Based on Judicial Fraud . . . ,\"\r\nand (2) \"That All Documents Being Witheld, and or Edited Be\r\nReleased In Full . . . ,\" seemingly attempt to insinuate new\r\nfacts and issues which are beyond the scope of this appeal. \r\n        The judgment is affirmed and all motions are denied.\r\n",
