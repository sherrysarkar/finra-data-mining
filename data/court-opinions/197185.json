On  this  appeal  Employers  asserts  that\r\n\nStratford's claim for coverage for  a suit brought on  behalf\r\n\nof  Crystal  Buffington,  post,  matured  within  the  policy\r                                          \r\n\nexclusion  definition prior  to  the policy's  issuance,  and\r\n\nthat,  in any event, the policy was voidable because of false\r\n\nanswers in the application.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Starting  at the  beginning, we  accept the  facts,\r\n\nrecited in Employers' brief  as undisputed, most favorable to\r\n\nit.  Morrissey v. Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, 54 F.3d 27,\r                                                            \r\n\n31 (1st Cir. 1995).  One  Harry Hikel became a music  teacher\r\n\nat  Stratford  in  1979.    In  1983 Stratford  conducted  an\r\n\ninvestigation and  held a hearing to  review allegations that\r\n\nHikel had  inappropriately hugged and kissed female students.\r\n\nAfter  the  hearing  the  Stratford  School  Board  voted  to\r\n\nreprimand him severely.  A  reprimand letter was delivered to\r\n\nhim  in January 1984.   Stratford did not  notify State Child\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nProtective Services  in accordance with N.H.  Rev. Stat. Ann.\r\n\n  169-C:29.1  Hikel left Stratford in 1986.\r\n\n          His next employer was the Lakeway Elementary School\r\n\nin  Littleton,  New  Hampshire.    According  to  one  of his\r\n\nstudents   there,  Crystal  Buffington,   he  began  sexually\r\n\nmolesting her during the fall of 1990  and continued to do so\r\n\nuntil the fall of 1992.  In 1993 the Manchester Union  Leader\r\n\nreported this, although not identifying Crystal, and asserted\r\n\nthat  the Department of  Education was  investigating charges\r\n\nthat Hikel had  sexually abused  students when  he taught  in\r\n\nLittleton.   For present purposes we assume that this came to\r\n\nStratford's  attention.   Thereafter, on  October 3,  1993, a\r\n\nGrafton  County Grand  Jury issued  a subpoena  in connection\r\n\nwith an investigation of  criminal sexual misconduct of Harry\r\n\nHikel in the  Littleton School District, seeking  Stratford's\r\n\nrecords on Hikel.  Stratford received the subpoena on October\r\n\n4.  On October 8 it applied for the present policy.\r\n\n          While  obviously the subpoena was a strong reminder\r\n\nthat other such conduct might occur,  the question is whether\r\n\nit suggested to Stratford (of which there is no evidence), or\r\n\nshould   have   suggested,    something   more    immediately\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  This statute contains no language giving causes of action\r\nto children who could  prove personal injury that might  have\r\nbeen avoided  had it been observed.   In Marquay v.  Eno, 662\r                                                                    \r\nA.2d  272, 278 (N.H. 1995),  the court held  that the statute\r\ncreated no personal rights.   We are not moved  by Employers'\r\ncontention   that  this   ruling   should  not   be   applied\r\nretroactively.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ntroublesome.  So contending,  Employers complains -- in terms\r\n\nof  warranty -- of Stratford's negative answers in the policy\r\n\napplication to questions 25 and 26:\r\n\n          25.   Has the applicant, Board and/or its\r\n          employees  been involved  in or  have any\r\n          knowledge of any  pending federal,  state\r\n          or  local  legal actions  or proceedings,\r\n          including EEOC, against  the entity,  its\r\n          board  members,  or employees  within the\r\n          last ten  years?  If yes,  attach details\r\n          stating nature  of claim, date  of claim,\r\n          loss date, loss payments and disposition,\r\n          carrier handling claims, etc.\r\n\n          26.  Are    there    any    circumstances\r\n          indicating  the probability of a claim or\r\n          action known by any  person to be covered\r\n          by  this  insurance?    If   yes,  attach\r\n          details.\r\n\nIn view of the lack of analysis in Employers' brief we regard\r\n\n25   as  being  included  in  26  and  ask  what  claims,  or\r\n\n\"circumstances,\" to quote  question 26, affecting  Stratford,\r\n\nthe subpoena  might  be thought  to  suggest.   Certainly  no\r\n\ncriminal  proceedings.     Nor  could  it   be  thought  that\r\n\nStratford's former  students were attempting to  reactivate a\r\n\ncause of  action arising  from behavior  that had  occurred a\r\n\ndecade  ago outside  of  Littleton.   Very  likely Hikel  was\r\n\ncharged  with   new  conduct  and  the   grand  jury,  before\r\n\nindicting, wished to look at the whole picture.  Nothing more\r\n\nhad  yet  happened.     But  might  some  imaginative  lawyer\r\n\nrepresenting  some  student  in   connection  with  this  new\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nconduct, think  of claiming against Stratford  for not having\r\n\npublished2 Hikel's prior behavior?  Anything is possible, but\r\n\nhow likely, let alone probable?\r\n\n          Employers  cites  no  authority  contradicting  our\r\n\nbelief  that a personal claim would be wholly frivolous.  The\r\n\nNew Hampshire  court's refusal to recognize  such rights even\r\n\nin  the statute  cited  supra, n.1,  confirms  this.   If  an\r                                         \r\n\ninsurance  applicant  is  told  he has  to  conceive  of, and\r\n\nreport,  every possibility  that someone  \"might\" (Employers'\r\n\nbrief)  bring a  frivolous  law suit,  Employers'  solicitors\r\n\nwould starve.   It  is because there  are possibilities  that\r\n\npeople  take out  insurance.   The application  announced the\r\n\nstandard for reporting -- not possibility, but probability.\r\n\n          The   application,  however,   was  not   the  only\r\n\nstandard-setter.   The policy itself, by  its terms, provides\r\n\nthat it does  not cover if \"the Insured ha[d] become aware of\r\n\na proceeding, event or development  which has resulted in  or\r\n\ncould  in the  future result  in the  institution of  a claim\r                                        \r\n\nagainst  the Insured. . . .\"  (Emphasis supplied.)  \"Possibly\r                                                                         \r\n\ncould result?\"  \"Reasonably  could result?\"3  \"Probably could\r                                                                   \r\n\nresult?\"  Even  apart from the principle  that ambiguities in\r\n\ninsurance contracts  are to be resolved  against the insurer,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  At  the  risk, incidentally,  of  incurring  a claim  for\r\ndefamation, depending on how the duty is conceived.\r\n\n3.  The New Hampshire case from which the court drew the more\r\nlimited word \"reasonable\" involved different policy language.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nTrombly v. Blue  Cross/Blue Shield of New  Hampshire-Vermont,\r                                                                        \r\n\n423 A.2d 980, 985  (N.H. 1980), it makes business  sense here\r\n\nto   construe  the   exclusion   clause  together   with  the\r\n\napplication  questionnaire.   Cf. Commercial  Union Assurance\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo.  v. Gilford Marina, Inc.,  408 A.2d 405,  407 (N.H. 1979)\r                                        \r\n\n(contradictory  clauses  in  an insurance  contract  must  be\r\n\ninterpreted  to reflect  the reasonable  expectations of  the\r\n\ninsured).  Hence we take probable.  For the insurer to go the\r\n\nother way, and  say we do not cover matters  of which you had\r\n\nnotice, even though  that notice  was too remote  for you  to\r\n\nhave to  tell us about it,  makes no sense; indeed,  it would\r\n\nseem affirmatively  misleading.  We  can not think  the facts\r\n\ncharged  Stratford  of  a  probability  that  some  Littleton\r\n\nstudent would sue it.\r\n\n          Finally, Employers' makes a  claim of malice.  This\r\n\nrequires no comment.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

Both parties moved for summary judgment, and the court ruled for Stratford.  On this appeal Employers asserts that Stratford's claim for coverage for a suit brought on behalf of Crystal Buffington, post, matured within the policy exclusion definition prior to the policy's issuance, and that, in any event, the policy was voidable because of false answers in the application.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting at the beginning, we accept the facts, recited in Employers' brief as undisputed, most favorable to it.  Morrissey v. Boston Five Cents Savings Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695511\"><a href=\"/opinion/695511/67-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1338-66-empl-prac-dec-p-43547-19/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1995).  One Harry Hikel became a music teacher at Stratford in 1979.  In 1983 Stratford conducted an investigation and held a hearing to review allegations that Hikel had inappropriately hugged and kissed female students.  After the hearing the Stratford School Board voted to reprimand him severely.  A reprimand letter was delivered to him in January 1984.  Stratford did not notify State Child Protective Services in accordance with N.H.Rev.Stat.Ann. &#167; 169-C:29.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Hikel left Stratford in 1986.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">His next employer was the Lakeway Elementary School in Littleton, New Hampshire.  According to one of his students there, Crystal Buffington, he began sexually molesting her during the fall of 1990 and continued to do so until the fall of 1992.  In 1993 the Manchester Union Leader reported this, although not identifying Crystal, and asserted that the Department of Education was investigating charges that Hikel had sexually abused students when he taught in Littleton.  For present purposes we assume that this came to Stratford's attention.  Thereafter, on October 3, 1993, a Grafton County Grand Jury issued a subpoena in connection with an investigation of criminal sexual misconduct of Harry Hikel in the Littleton School District, seeking Stratford's records on Hikel.  Stratford received the subpoena on October 4.  On October 8 it applied for the present policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While obviously the subpoena was a strong reminder that other such conduct might occur, the question is whether it suggested to Stratford (of which there is no evidence), or should have suggested, something more immediately troublesome.  So contending, Employers complains--in terms of warranty--of Stratford's negative answers in the policy application to questions 25 and 26:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>25.  Has the applicant, Board and/or its employees been involved in or have any knowledge of any pending federal, state or local legal actions or proceedings, including EEOC, against the entity, its board members, or employees within the last ten years?   If yes, attach details stating nature of claim, date of claim, loss date, loss payments and disposition, carrier handling claims, etc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>26. Are there any circumstances indicating the probability of a claim or action known by any person to be covered by this insurance?   If yes, attach details.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the lack of analysis in Employers' brief we regard 25 as being included in 26 and ask what claims, or \"circumstances,\" to quote question 26, affecting Stratford, the subpoena might be thought to suggest.  Certainly no criminal proceedings.  Nor could it be thought that Stratford's former students were attempting to reactivate a cause of action arising from behavior that had occurred a decade ago outside of Littleton.  Very likely Hikel was charged with new conduct and the grand jury, before indicting, wished to look at the whole picture.  Nothing more had yet happened.  But might some imaginative lawyer representing some student in connection with this new conduct, think of claiming against Stratford for not having published<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Hikel's prior behavior?   Anything is possible, but how likely, let alone probable?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Employers cites no authority contradicting our belief that a personal claim would be wholly frivolous.  The New Hampshire court's refusal to recognize such rights even in the statute cited supra, n. 1, confirms this.  If an insurance applicant is told he has to conceive of, and report, every possibility that someone \"might\" (Employers' brief) bring a frivolous law suit, Employers' solicitors would starve.  It is because there are possibilities that people take out insurance.  The application announced the standard for reporting--not possibility, but probability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The application, however, was not the only standard-setter.  The policy itself, by its terms, provides that it does not cover if \"the Insured ha[d] become aware of a proceeding, event or development which has resulted in or could in the future result in the institution of a claim against the Insured....\"  (Emphasis supplied.)  \"Possibly could result?\"  \"Reasonably could result?\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  \"Probably could result?\"   Even apart from the principle that ambiguities in insurance contracts are to be resolved against the insurer, Trombly v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New Hampshire-Vermont, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2000682\"><a href=\"/opinion/2000682/trombly-v-blue-crossblue-shield/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></span>, 985 (1980), it makes business sense here to construe the exclusion clause together with the application questionnaire.  Cf. Commercial Union Assurance Co. v. Gilford Marina, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2295483\"><a href=\"/opinion/2295483/commercial-union-assurance-co-v-gilford-marina-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></span>, 407 (1979) (contradictory clauses in an insurance contract must be interpreted to reflect the reasonable expectations of the insured).  Hence we take probable.  For the insurer to go the other way, and say we do not cover matters of which you had notice, even though that notice was too remote for you to have to tell us about it, makes no sense;  indeed, it would seem affirmatively misleading.  We can not think the facts charged Stratford of a probability that some Littleton student would sue it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Employers' makes a claim of malice.  This requires no comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This statute contains no language giving causes of action to children who could prove personal injury that might have been avoided had it been observed.
