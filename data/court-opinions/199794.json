Collette for appellee.\n\n                     ____________________\n\n                       January 10, 2002\n                    _____________________\n\f________________________\n*Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n          Per Curiam. Luis Santana-Mendoza is a dairy farmer who,\n\nacting in concert with others, adulterated milk by adding salt and\n\nwater. The milk he adulterated was dumped into tanker trucks which\n\ndelivered the milk to processing plants. When it reached the plants,\n\nthe milk was then added to large silos; all of the milk in the silos\n\nwas adulterated as a result.      The milk from the silos was then\n\ndistributed into interstate commerce for purchase and consumption.\n\nSantana-Mendoza pleaded guilty to conspiracy to deliver adulterated\n\nfood for introduction into interstate commerce, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 331(a), 333(a)(2), and 18 U.S.C. § 371.\n\n          In calculating the loss caused by the defendant’s scheme for\n\na sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1(b)(1), the district\n\ncourt adopted as the relevant volume of contaminated milk the total\n\namount of milk in the tanker trucks that collected milk from Santana-\n\nMendoza’s farm. In doing so, the court rejected the government’s\n\ncontention that the loss should be measured on the basis of all the\n\nmilk contained in the silos, and also rejected the defendant’s\n\nassertion that the loss should be calculated on the basis of the amount\n\nof water added to the milk. This resulted in a final offense level of\n\n13, for which the district court imposed a sentence of 12 months’\n\nimprisonment, a fine of $3,000, and a supervised release term of 3\n\fyears. Santana-Mendoza here appeals the district court’s calculation\n\nof loss, reasserting his contention that the relevant volume in\n\nfiguring loss under § 2F1.1(b)(1) was the amount of water which he\n\ncaused to be added to the silos.\n\n          Our recent decision in United States v. Gonzalez-Alvarez, No.\n\n00-2180, is dispositive of this issue. The relevant volume of milk for\n\nthe purpose of calculating loss under the Guidelines was the entire\n\nsupply of contaminated milk in the silos. Because the government did\n\nnot cross-appeal in this case, however, we decline to remand for\n\nresentencing.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\f",
