DUBOIS, ET AL.,\n\n                        Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                  FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Michael Kevin DuPont on brief pro se.\n     Nancy Ankers White, Special Assistant Attorney General, and\nDavid J. Rentsch, Counsel, Department of Correction, on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                            March 26, 2002\n\f           Per Curiam. Pro se appellant, Michael Kevin DuPont,\n\nappeals from the district court's grant of summary judgment for\n\nAppellees.    We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n           On appeal, DuPont complains that the district court\n\nfailed to address all of the claims alleged in his complaint.\n\nUpon careful review of the record, we agree with DuPont that a\n\nnumber of his claims were not considered.              The district court,\n\nin   a    margin        order,     dismissed     DuPont's    action   based\n\nsubstantially      on    the     Appellees'    Memorandum   in   Support   of\n\nSummary Judgment.         The Appellees' memorandum, however, failed\n\nto address all of the claims asserted in DuPont's complaint.\n\nMost significantly it ignored: (1) a due process claim based on\n\nhis asserted confinement in the Department Segregation Unit\n\n(\"DSU\") at MCI-Cedar Junction, (2) claims deriving from his\n\nalleged treatment while in the DSU; (3) a claim that DuPont was\n\nplaced in the DSU in retaliation for his testimony in state\n\ncourt; and (4) a claim that DuPont was denied access to the\n\ncourts as the result of various purported actions by the\n\nAppellees.\n\n             Our preliminary review of the complaint, to which\n\nAppellees have as yet filed no answer, suggests that the\n\nundiscussed claims, on their face at least, state claims for\n\nrelief.      The   Appellees        have   presented   no   affidavits     nor\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fdocumentary evidence to refute the allegations of fact and have\n\nprovided us with no legal basis for dismissal below of these\n\nclaims as they now stand.    We are therefore unable to find\n\nsupport in the record for the grant of summary judgment on the\n\nallegations not yet addressed by the Appellees.   Absent a more\n\ndeveloped record, the grant of summary judgment on these issues\n\nwas premature and must be vacated and remanded.\n          We affirm the grant of summary judgment as to all the\n\nissues addressed in the Appellees' Memorandum in Support of\n\nSummary Judgment.   As to DuPont's other allegations the grant\n\nof summary judgment is vacated and the case is remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                              -3-\n\f",
