In  March 1992,  plaintiff Richard  Nathanson\r                          \r\n\nserved as head of  the loan workout department at  Rockland Trust\r\n\nCompany (\"Rockland\") and was in line for promotion to senior vice\r\n\npresident.   During that period, James Moore, a bank examiner for\r\n\nthe  Federal   Deposit   Insurance  Corporation   (\"FDIC\"),   was\r\n\nconducting a supervisory examination of Rockland.  Moore received\r\n\nthe impression,  during several  discussions of problem  loans in\r\n\nthe department, that plaintiff was being less than cooperative--a\r\n\nconcern  that   he  voiced  to  Rockland   executives.    Shortly\r\n\nthereafter, Moore learned that plaintiff had been the subject  of\r\n\nan Apparent Crime Report (\"ACR\"),  filed by another bank, arising\r\n\nout of  a line of  credit in  excess of  $3 million  that he  had\r\n\nguaranteed.    See 12  C.F.R.    353  (prescribing  ACR reporting\r                            \r\n\nrequirements).  Plaintiff had earlier disclosed this debt to both\r\n\nRockland and the FDIC--a fact of  which Moore was unaware.  In an\r\n\nensuing discussion with  Rockland's president, Moore  recommended\r\n\nthat  an  inquiry   be  conducted   into  plaintiff's   financial\r\n\nobligations;  when pressed for  further information,  he revealed\r\n\nthat the  ACR had been filed  but did not disclose  its contents.\r\n\nMoore  explained   that  he   was   not  requesting   plaintiff's\r\n\ntermination.   Plaintiff was nonetheless fired  from his position\r\n\nshortly thereafter. \r\n\n     Plaintiff responded by filing the instant action against the\r\n\nFDIC for  damages under the Privacy Act, claiming that disclosure\r\n\nof the ACR had been unlawful.  See 5 U.S.C.    552a(g)(1)(D).  On\r                                            \r\n\nthe basis  of the  undisputed facts recited  above, the  district\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ncourt  ended up  granting summary judgment  for defendant  on two\r\n\nindependent grounds.  First,  it held that disclosure of  the ACR\r\n\nfell within the Act's \"routine use\" exception.  Id.   552a(b)(3);\r                                                             \r\n\nsee 53 Fed.  Reg. 7396,  7398 (1988) (FDIC  \"routine use\"  notice\r             \r\n\npermitting  disclosure  of  ACRs  to, inter  alia,  \"a  financial\r                                                           \r\n\ninstitution  affected  by   enforcement  activities  or  reported\r\n\ncriminal activities\"); see, e.g., FLRA v. Department of Navy, 941\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 49, 52-53,  58 (1st Cir. 1991) (discussing  requirements for\r\n\napplying routine  use exception).  Alternatively,  it ruled that,\r\n\neven  if the  Act had  been violated,  no damages  were available\r\n\ninasmuch  as  Moore's  conduct   had  not  been  \"intentional  or\r\n\nwillful,\"  as required by  the Act.   See 5 U.S.C.    552a(g)(4).\r                                                   \r\n\nThis appeal ensued.\r\n\n     We  affirm on the  latter ground alone.   As  to the former,\r\n\nplaintiff  contends on appeal that  the court erred  in two basic\r\n\nrespects:  in finding (1) that  disclosure of the  ACR was within\r\n\nthe scope  of the  published exception (i.e.,  that Rockland  was\r\n\n\"affected\"  by the  report),  and (2)  that  such disclosure  was\r\n\ncompatible  with  the  purposes  for  which  the  ACR  had   been\r\n\ncollected.   It is difficult to fault either of these conclusions\r\n\nbased  on the arguments before  the court.   What complicates the\r\n\nissue is a matter  that the parties inexplicably failed  to raise\r\n\nbelow  (but that plaintiff  has emphasized  on appeal):  the fact\r\n\nthat  the  FDIC  has  elsewhere  specifically  indicated  to  the\r\n\ncontrary.    See  58 Fed.  Reg.  28772,  28773 (1993)  (rejecting\r                          \r\n\nproposal  that  ACRs   be  made  available  to  banks   that  are\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nconsidering   employing  or   doing  business   with  individuals\r\n\nmentioned therein,  on ground that \"privacy  restrictions prevent\r\n\nFDIC  from sharing information in reports  of apparent crime with\r\n\nanyone   other   than   appropriate   federal   law   enforcement\r\n\nauthorities\").  The FDIC concedes that such commentary, published\r\n\nin connection with a 1993 revision to 12 C.F.R.    353, conflicts\r\n\nwith the routine use notice at issue here.  And  while it insists\r\n\nthat  the matter can be ignored because of plaintiff's failure to\r\n\nmention  it below, we think the agency is equally responsible for\r\n\nfailing to alert  the court to  obviously relevant commentary  of\r\n\nits own  making.  If the appeal hinged on this question, we would\r\n\ndeem it  appropriate to remand  for consideration thereof  by the\r\n\ndistrict court in the first instance.\r\n\n     Yet  such commentary, published  in 1993, has  no bearing on\r\n\nwhether Moore acted in an intentional or willful fashion in 1992.\r\n\nAnd on the basis of the evidence presented, we agree that summary\r\n\njudgment  for  defendant is  warranted on  this  ground.   As the\r\n\nparties agree, the intentional or willful standard is a stringent\r\n\none which is viewed as \"somewhat greater than gross  negligence.\"\r\n\nBritt  v. Naval  Investig. Service,  886 F.2d  544, 551  (3d Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1989)  (quoting legislative  history); accord,  e.g.,  Wilborn v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nDepartment of HHS, 49 F.3d 597, 602 (9th Cir. 1995).   In typical\r                           \r\n\nformulations,  courts  have held  that  an  agency violates  this\r\n\nstandard by  \"committing the act without grounds for believing it\r\n\nto be lawful, or by flagrantly  disregarding others' rights under\r\n\nthe Act,\" Albright v. United States, 732 F.2d 181, 189 (D.C. Cir.\r                                             \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n1984), or by  committing a violation  \"so patently egregious  and\r\n\nunlawful that anyone undertaking the conduct should have known it\r\n\nunlawful,\"  Laningham v. United States Navy,  813 F.2d 1236, 1242\r                                                     \r\n\n(D.C.  Cir.  1987)  (internal  quotations  omitted);  see,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nAndrews v.

The 1986 routine use notice, permitting disclosure\r\n\nof  an  ACR to  an  \"affected\"  institution, afforded  reasonable\r\n\ngrounds for believing that his conduct was lawful.  Moore himself\r\n\nso  averred, stating  that  it was  his  understanding of  agency\r\n\npolicy  to  bring   information  concerning  potential   criminal\r\n\nactivity to the attention of bank officials \"in order for them to\r\n\nbe alerted to or correct potential problems.\"  And his failure to\r\n\nuncover the fact  that plaintiff had  earlier disclosed his  loan\r\n\nobligations--even   if  negligent--fell   well  short   of  being\r\n\n\"somewhat greater than gross negligence.\" \r\n\n     In this regard, plaintiff voices two procedural  complaints:\r\n\nthat  the court  resolved the  willfulness issue  (1) only  after\r\n\nearlier  announcing  that  it would  not  do  so  at the  summary\r\n\njudgment  stage, and (2) without  addressing his request that any\r\n\nsuch ruling be deferred pending further discovery.  Yet plaintiff\r\n\nacknowledged  below  that  defendant's  motion   to  dismiss  was\r\n\nproperly converted into  one for  summary judgment.   He  himself\r\n\nfiled a motion for partial summary judgment.  While he now claims\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nto have been  caught by surprise by the  court's ruling, he filed\r\n\nno motion for reconsideration  below.  And on appeal, he does not\r\n\nseek to vacate the judgment  on this basis.  Instead, he  pursues\r\n\nquite a  different route--arguing,  in the alternative,  that the\r\n\nevidence is  sufficient  for him  to prevail  on the  willfulness\r\n\nissue or,  at a minimum,  that a genuine  issue of fact  has been\r\n\ndemonstrated in this regard.   We disagree in both respects.   We\r\n\ntherefore find no error.\r\n\n     Affirmed. \r                        \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n",

Moore received the impression, during several discussions of problem loans in the department, that plaintiff was being less than cooperative--a concern that he voiced to Rockland executives.   Shortly thereafter, Moore learned that plaintiff had been the subject of an Apparent Crime Report (\"ACR\"), filed by another bank, arising out of a line of credit in excess of $3 million that he had guaranteed.   See 12 C.F.R. &#167; 353 (prescribing ACR reporting requirements).   Plaintiff had earlier disclosed this debt to both Rockland and the FDIC--a fact of which Moore was unaware.   In an ensuing discussion with Rockland's president, Moore recommended that an inquiry be conducted into plaintiff's financial obligations;  when pressed for further information, he revealed that the ACR had been filed but did not disclose its contents.   Moore explained that he was not requesting plaintiff's termination.   Plaintiff was nonetheless fired from his position shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff responded by filing the instant action against the FDIC for damages under the Privacy Act, claiming that disclosure of the ACR had been unlawful.   See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552a(g)(1)(D).   On the basis of the undisputed facts recited above, the district court ended up granting summary judgment for defendant on two independent grounds.   First, it held that disclosure of the ACR fell within the Act's \"routine use\" exception.   Id. &#167; 552a(b)(3);  see 53 Fed.Reg. 7396, 7398 (1988) (FDIC \"routine use\" notice permitting disclosure of ACRs to, inter alia, \"a financial institution affected by enforcement activities or reported criminal activities\");  see, e.g., FLRA v. Department of Navy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566309\"><a href=\"/opinion/566309/federal-labor-relations-authority-v-us-department-of-the-navy-naval/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 52-53, 58 (1st Cir.1991) (discussing requirements for applying routine use exception).   Alternatively, it ruled that, even if the Act had been violated, no damages were available inasmuch as Moore's conduct had not been \"intentional or willful,\" as required by the Act.  See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552a(g)(4).   This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm on the latter ground alone.   As to the former, plaintiff contends on appeal that the court erred in two basic respects:  in finding (1) that disclosure of the ACR was within the scope of the published exception (i.e., that Rockland was \"affected\" by the report), and (2) that such disclosure was compatible with the purposes for which the ACR had been collected.   It is difficult to fault either of these conclusions based on the arguments before the court.   What complicates the issue is a matter that the parties inexplicably failed to raise below (but that plaintiff has emphasized on appeal):  the fact that the FDIC has elsewhere specifically indicated to the contrary.   See 58 Fed.Reg. 28772, 28773 (1993) (rejecting proposal that ACRs be made available to banks that are considering employing or doing business with individuals mentioned therein, on ground that \"privacy restrictions prevent FDIC from sharing information in reports of apparent crime with anyone other than appropriate federal law enforcement authorities\").   The FDIC concedes that such commentary, published in connection with a 1993 revision to 12 C.F.R. &#167; 353, conflicts with the routine use notice at issue here.   And while it insists that the matter can be ignored because of plaintiff's failure to mention it below, we think the agency is equally responsible for failing to alert the court to obviously relevant commentary of its own making.   If the appeal hinged on this question, we would deem it appropriate to remand for consideration thereof by the district court in the first instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet such commentary, published in 1993, has no bearing on whether Moore acted in an intentional or willful fashion in 1992.   And on the basis of the evidence presented, we agree that summary judgment for defendant is warranted on this ground.   As the parties agree, the intentional or willful standard is a stringent one which is viewed as \"somewhat greater than gross negligence.\"  Britt v. Naval Investig.   Service, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529951\"><a href=\"/opinion/529951/britt-stephen-j-v-naval-investigative-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, 551 (3d Cir.1989) (quoting legislative history);  accord, e.g., Wilborn v.

In typical formulations, courts have held that an agency violates this standard by \"committing the act without grounds for believing it to be lawful, or by flagrantly disregarding others' rights under the Act,\" Albright v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434658\"><a href=\"/opinion/434658/william-a-borders-jr-commissioner-district-of-columbia-judicial/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span>, 189 (D.C.Cir.1984), or by committing a violation \"so patently egregious and unlawful that anyone undertaking the conduct should have known it unlawful,\" Laningham v. United States Navy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484872\"><a href=\"/opinion/484872/ross-j-laningham-v-united-states-navy/\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1236</span></a></span>, 1242 (D.C.Cir.1987) (internal quotations omitted);  see, e.g., Andrews v. Veterans Admin., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500787\"><a href=\"/opinion/500787/georgia-andrews-erin-brett-frances-e-cassle-bj-durham-maureen/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span>, 424-25 (10th Cir.)  (reviewing caselaw), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></span> (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even with the record construed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, there is nothing to suggest that Moore acted in any such fashion.   The 1986 routine use notice, permitting disclosure of an ACR to an \"affected\" institution, afforded reasonable grounds for believing that his conduct was lawful.   Moore himself so averred, stating that it was his understanding of agency policy to bring information concerning potential criminal activity to the attention of bank officials \"in order for them to be alerted to or correct potential problems.\"   And his failure to uncover the fact that plaintiff had earlier disclosed his loan obligations--even if negligent--fell well short of being \"somewhat greater than gross negligence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this regard, plaintiff voices two procedural complaints:  that the court resolved the willfulness issue (1) only after earlier announcing that it would not do so at the summary judgment stage, and (2) without addressing his request that any such ruling be deferred pending further discovery.   Yet plaintiff acknowledged below that defendant's motion to dismiss was properly converted into one for summary judgment.   He himself filed a motion for partial summary judgment.   While he now claims to have been caught by surprise by the court's ruling, he filed no motion for reconsideration below.   And on appeal, he does not seek to vacate the judgment on this basis.   Instead, he pursues quite a different route--arguing, in the alternative, that the evidence is sufficient for him to prevail on the willfulness issue or, at a minimum, that a genuine issue of fact has been demonstrated in this regard.   We disagree in both respects.   We therefore find no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
