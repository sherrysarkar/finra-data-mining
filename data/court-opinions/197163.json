That  ruling   was  consistent   with  the\r\n\nrequirements of Fed. R.

The\r\n\ndistrict court  adequately fulfilled  its role under  Fed. R.\r\n\nEvid. 901 when it  determined that the detective's comparison\r\n\nwas \"reasonably  reliable\" and the  jury could believe  it or\r\n\nnot,  and that  the bottle  with its  glue markings  was \"not\r\n\nentirely fungible\" and had some \"character,  weak admittedly,\r\n\nbut sufficient  so the jury could say it is the same bottle.\"\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nWe likewise reject defendant's unsupported argument that this\r\n\ncourt is required to make its own comparison de novo.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
