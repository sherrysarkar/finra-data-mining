We agree.\r\n\n                  Findings and Conclusions Below\r\n\n     The findings  of fact of  the bankruptcy court,  affirmed by\r\n\nthe  district  court, are  the following.    One of  the debtors,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  Section 503(b) provides, in relevant part:\r\n\n     (b) After notice and a hearing, there shall be allowed,\r\n     administrative expenses ..., including -\r\n          (1)(A) the actual, necessary costs and\r\n          expenses of preserving the estate, including\r\n          wages, salaries, or commissions for services\r\n          rendered after commencement of the case ....\r\n\n     2  Section 506(c) provides, in relevant part:\r\n\n     [T]he trustee may recover from property secured as an\r\n     allowable claim the reasonable, necessary costs and\r\n     expenses of preserving, or disposing of, such property\r\n     to the extent of any benefit to the holder of such\r\n     claim.\r\n\n     Appellants also sought recovery under a restitution theory.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nSpringfield Post Road  Corp., owned land  constituting part of  a\r\n\nstrip  type shopping  mall  in Springfield,  Massachusetts.   The\r\n\nremaining  portion was leased under  a ground lease  to the other\r\n\ndebtor,  Route  20-21 Associates,  Inc.   The  president  of both\r\n\ndebtors was Melvin Getlan.\r\n\n     In the spring of  1991 Getlan asked Gallivan, a  real estate\r\n\nbroker  specializing  in  finding national  restaurant  chains as\r\n\nbuyers or  lessees of property, to obtain a tenant for one of the\r\n\nmall's buildings.   Getlan agreed  to pay a  commission of  seven\r\n\npercent of gross rental for years  one through ten of any  lease,\r\n\npayable  on the  commencement  of construction.   Through  Smith,\r\n\nanother  broker with  experience  in finding  restaurant  chains,\r\n\nGallivan pursued  The Olive Garden, a  restaurant chain operating\r\n\nas  a division of General  Mills Restaurants, Inc.   Gallivan and\r\n\nSmith agreed on an even split of the commission.\r\n\n     After two  years, a lease was  signed by debtors on  May 17,\r\n\n1993 and  by General Mills on June 17, 1993.  The lease envisaged\r\n\nthe razing of the existing building and the construction of a new\r\n\none.  The  lease was to commence after General  Mills gave notice\r\n\nthat  all conditions had been met or waived.  Conditions included\r\n\nissuance of a liquor  license and building permit, approval  of a\r\n\nsite plan  by Marshall's,  the debtors'  largest tenant, and  the\r\n\nexecution of nondisturbance agreements  by prior mortgagees.  The\r\n\nseven percent brokerage commission came to $66,780.   On June 25,\r\n\n1993 the debtors filed  petitions under Chapter 11  and continued\r\n\nin possession.   Smith  and Gallivan, although  claiming to  have\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nworked seventy or eighty  hours on lease-associated matters after\r\n\nthe  filing of the petitions, were found to have \"devoted perhaps\r\n\ntwenty-five hours\" post petition, primarily to obtaining approval\r\n\nof the site plan.   Several months after filing,  construction of\r\n\nthe new building commenced.\r\n\n     The  most  critical  findings  were  that,  under  the  oral\r\n\nbrokerage agreement, \"the  commission was to  be earned when  the\r\n\nlease  was signed  and was  to  become payable  when construction\r\n\ncommenced;\"  and   that  whatever  services  were   performed  by\r\n\nappellants  after  the  Chapter  11  petitions  were  filed  were\r\n\ngratuitous and not required by their agreement, but were rendered\r\n\nin  their  own  interest   to  \"facilitate  consummation  of  the\r\n\ntransaction.\" \r\n\n     The  court held, with  respect to  the claim  under  503(b),\r\n\nthat, since appellants' post-petition  services were not required\r\n\nby  the brokerage  agreement,  they were  not \"actual,  necessary\r\n\ncosts\"  of preserving  the  estate or  \"commissions for  services\r\n\nrendered  after the  commencement of  the case.\"   The  same fact\r\n\nfindings  dictated an  alternate  conclusion, that  the  contract\r\n\nbetween  the debtors  and plaintiffs  could not  be viewed  as an\r\n\nexecutory  contract at the time  of filing, which  could later be\r\n\nassumed by the estate.\r\n\n     The  court cited four grounds  in support of  its refusal to\r\n\napply  506(c):  (1)  that the statute contemplates only  required\r\n\npost-petition  services; (2)  that  plaintiffs  lacked  standing,\r\n\nsince  the statute specifies only that \"The trustee may recover .\r                                                             \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n. .\" (emphasis added), and no special circumstances existed, such\r\n\nas was the case in In re Parque Forestal, Inc., 949 F.2d 504, 511\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991);3 (3) that the direct and  intended beneficiaries\r\n\nof  any services were the debtors, not the secured party; and (4)\r\n\nthat any services rendered by appellants merely \"enhanced, rather\r\n\nthan preserved\" the collateral secured.\r\n\n     The  court  did  not   reach  or  deal  with   the  debtors'\r\n\nalternative  claim for  restitution, since  this depended  on the\r\n\nprior existence  of an executory  agreement, which the  court had\r\n\nrejected.\r\n\n                            Discussion\r\n\n     Before commencing  our analysis, we  think it  is useful  to\r\n\nplace  appellants' claims in perspective.   The issue  is not one\r\n\nwhich should be viewed in  isolation, outside of the  established\r\n\nmetes and  bounds of bankruptcy law.   That is, it  is beside the\r\n\npoint  to consider  whether  able,  persistent, resourceful  real\r\n\nestate brokers, who  not only  found a ready,  willing, and  able\r\n\nlessee,  but worked  to assure  the satisfaction  of a  number of\r\n\nconditions  of  the  lease,  are entitled  to  their  commission.\r\n\nRather, we are dealing with  a debt owed by an estate  within the\r\n\nrealm of bankruptcy, with  its various rules to assist  in making\r\n\nthe  least  unfair  allocation   of  inadequate  resources  among\r\n\ncontesting creditors.  The precise question is  whether the post-\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3    In In re Parque Forestal, 949 F.2d 504, 511-12 (1st\r                                            \r\nCir. 1991), we agreed with two other circuits that third parties\r\nmay recover where they have equitably come to stand in the\r\ntrustees' shoes, especially where a colorable claim exists and\r\nwhere a third party is the only one likely to pursue it.  \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\npetition services of these appellants were so bargained for or so\r\n\ncrucially indispensable as to elevate  what would otherwise be an\r\n\nunsecured  claim to  a priority  claim that  must be  paid before\r\n\nthose  of  other  unpaid  pre-petition  suppliers  of  goods  and\r\n\nservices.\r\n\n     We  begin  our  analysis  by  addressing  appellants'  legal\r\n\nproposition  having  to do  with our  standard  of review.   They\r\n\ncontend that whether or  not post-filing performance was required\r\n\nof  the brokers  is not  only  a question  of law,  but of  state\r\n\n(Massachusetts) law.   Appellants cite such  cases as Bennett  v.\r                                                                           \r\n\nMcCabe, 808 F.2d 178 (1st Cir. 1987) and Tristram's Landing, Inc.\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.  Wait,  367 Mass.  622 (1975)  for  the proposition  that real\r                  \r\n\nestate brokers earn their  commissions, absent breach of contract\r\n\nby their principals, when the transaction has been completed, not\r\n\nwhen the  purchase and  sale (or  lease)  agreement is  executed.\r\n\nThis proposition,  say appellants,  is binding on  the bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt,  forecloses any fact  finding, is reviewable  de novo, and\r                                                                      \r\n\nwarrants reversal of the judgment below.\r\n\n     We disagree.  Appellants, it seems to us, have  misconceived\r\n\nthe thrust of  the authorities cited,  as well as  the source  of\r\n\ngoverning law.  In  Bennett we were addressing the  sole question\r                                     \r\n\nwhether, under current Massachusetts law, an unintended, innocent\r\n\nseller's default  resulting in  the frustration of  a transaction\r\n\nwould  justify  the  seller's refusal  to  honor  an  agreed upon\r\n\nbroker's commission.   Bennett, 808 F.2d  at 179-80.   Tristram's\r                                                                           \r\n\nLanding announced the basic proposition that when a commission is\r                 \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\npayable \"on the  sale,\" a broker is not  entitled to a commission\r\n\nuntil  the transaction  is  completed.   Tristram's Landing,  367\r                                                                     \r\n\nMass. at  626.  But there the  court made very clear  that it was\r\n\nnot  defining an obligation of the broker, but rather was dealing\r\n\nwith a special agreement or circumstance \"wherein consummation of\r\n\nthe sale became a condition precedent for the broker  to earn his\r\n\ncommission.\"  Id. at 627. \r                          \r\n\n     This difference  was explicitly recognized in  In re Munple,\r                                                                           \r\n\nLtd.,  868 F.2d 1129, 1130-31  (9th Cir. 1989),  where a purchase\r              \r\n\nand  sale agreement provided that a broker's commission was to be\r\n\npayable \"at the close of escrow.\"  The conclusion of the deal was\r\n\ndelayed by a  dispute between seller and buyer.   The seller then\r\n\nfiled under Chapter  11; the two  parties finally composed  their\r\n\ndifferences  and the seller  then sought  to assume  the purchase\r\n\nagreement free  and clear of  the broker's claim  for commission.\r\n\nThe  broker argued that the agreement was executory, and thus had\r\n\nbeen  assumed by the estate because payment was contingent on the\r\n\nclosing of the sale.  The Court of Appeals observed:\r\n\n     This  argument  confuses  performance  obligations  and\r\n     conditions precedent. . .  . The condition precedent to\r\n     [seller's]  obligation to pay the commission imposed no\r\n     further  obligations  on  [broker],  nonperformance  of\r\n     which  would have  excused  [seller]  from  paying  the\r\n     commission.    Because  [broker]  had  done  everything\r\n     required of  it to earn the  commission, the commission\r\n     provision in the purchase agreement was not executory.\r\n\nWe therefore do  not agree that  these cases support  appellants'\r\n\nclaims.\r\n\n     Moreover, the  governing statute in  this case is  11 U.S.C.\r\n\n 503(b).   Its requirements are to be assessed under federal law.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nIn re Munple, Ltd., 868  F.2d at 1130.  As we have held  in In re\r                                                                           \r\n\nMammoth  Mart, Inc.,  536  F.2d 950,  954  (1st Cir.  1976)  with\r                             \r\n\nreference to the predecessor of  503(b), \r\n\n     It  is . . .  clear that a  claimant who fully performs\r\n     under a  contract prior to  the filing of  the petition\r\n     will not be entitled to first priority  even though his\r\n     services may  have resulted in a direct  benefit to the\r\n     bankrupt after the filing.\r\n\nWhat is not  foreclosed under  503(b)  is an executory  contract,\r\n\nwhich may be  assumed by the debtor.  Federal  courts have pretty\r\n\ngenerally settled  upon the following definition  of an executory\r\n\ncontract: \"a  contract under which the obligation[s]  of both the\r\n\nbankrupt  and  the  other  party  to  the  contract  are  so  far\r\n\nunperformed that  the failure  of either to  complete performance\r\n\nwould constitute  a material  breach excusing performance  of the\r\n\nother.\"   In re  Columbia Gas System  Inc., 50 F.3d  233, 239 (3d\r                                                    \r\n\nCir. 1995)(citation  omitted).  \r\n\n     We  therefore proceed with our review for clear error of the\r\n\nbankruptcy court's finding  that the brokers' bargained-for  work\r\n\nhad  been  done  as  of the  filing  of  the  petitions and  that\r\n\nsubsequent efforts were gratuitous.\r\n\n     Gallivan's  testimony was that not  only was the  fee set at\r\n\nseven percent,  but that in  dealing with  ground leases  (leases\r\n\nwhere a tenant  must construct  his own improvement  on the  land\r\n\nleased), \"There are  a number of conditions that  a broker has to\r\n\nperform .  . . .  [s]uch as site  plan, hazardous waste,  in this\r\n\ncase nondisturbance, liquor licenses.\"   A broker is,  he further\r\n\ntestified, entitled to a  ground lease commission \"normally\" upon\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nthe initiating of construction, when all the conditions have been\r\n\nmet.  Later, when he told Smith of the terms of the agreement, he\r\n\nreferred to  the \"payable upon construction\"  term, saying, \"[H]e\r\n\nand  I have done a  number of restaurant  deals and that's fairly\r\n\ncommon in our  industry.\"  He said that Getlan  had indicated his\r\n\nagreement  to a seven percent  fee, payable on  construction.  No\r\n\nspecific  conditions were  identified as  having  been discussed.\r\n\nThe lease  itself, signed  well after the  discussions, contained\r\n\nsome dozen  conditions, some requiring action  from the landlord,\r\n\nsome from the tenant.  \r\n\n     Getlan  testified that  he had  never accepted  a letter  of\r\n\nagreement that the brokers had prepared.  He even denied that  he\r\n\nhad agreed  on the fee and  time of payment; on  these points the\r\n\ncourt found against him.   He said he normally did not  settle on\r\n\ncommission  details before he had  a live tenant  before him, and\r\n\nthat every deal  was different.   As for  discussing services  in\r\n\naddition to  finding a  tenant, Getlan acknowledged  that it  was\r\n\nnormal for  brokers to  do  what they  could  in their  own  best\r\n\ninterest.  He, however,  thought that The Olive Garden  chain had\r\n\ntheir own resources.\r\n\n     When asked  if he discussed  with Gallivan  help in  getting\r\n\nother approvals, he said:\r\n\n     THE  WITNESS:   He volunteered  to help,  if necessary,\r\n     with the building department to get any permits or find\r\n     out what was needed  or what.  He volunteered  for that\r\n     and I assume he did whatever he was asked to do by them\r\n     or he may have done something on his own, I don't know.\r\n\n     THE COURT:  Did you ask him to do anything. . . ?\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n     THE WITNESS:  I don't think I asked him to do  anything\r\n     personally.\r\n\n     On  this record, we cannot  find clear error  in the court's\r\n\ndetermination that appellants had  earned their commission in the\r\n\nsense that they had done all that they were obligated to do prior\r\n\nto  the debtors'  filing  and  that  their further  efforts  were\r\n\ngratuitous.  We have already  noted Getlan's comments with regard\r\n\nto  any work done in pursuing  various governmental permits, such\r\n\nas liquor licenses.   The major efforts, according to  the court,\r\n\nwere directed toward obtaining the  approval of Marshalls to  the\r\n\nsite plan. Here, the  court could reasonably find that  the basic\r\n\napproval  had been given before  execution of the  lease and that\r\n\nthe delay in getting written approval of details long settled was\r\n\noccasioned by a complete  change of staff in the  relevant office\r\n\nof  Marshalls.   Similarly,  Getlan performed  whatever work  was\r\n\nnecessary  to  get  the  mortgagees  to  execute   nondisturbance\r\n\nagreements,  insofar as  the mortgagees  were involved.   Smith's\r\n\nefforts were directed  toward persuading the tenant that it could\r\n\nlive with what the first mortgagee had insisted on.  And there is\r\n\nno  evidence that  these services,  as well  as the  others, were\r\n\nrequested by Getlan.\r\n\n     The  efforts  expended  by  appellants,  post petition,  are\r\n\nreminiscent of  those of the  brokers in In re  Munple, Ltd., 868\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 1131:\r\n\n     [Broker]   contends   that   the   purchase   agreement\r\n     \"authorized\" it to render  such services and gave  it a\r\n     \"strong  incentive\"  to  help close  the  deal  because\r\n     payment of  the commission was  contingent on  closing.\r\n     [Citation  omitted.]  Even if  true, these facts do not\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n     render the commission agreement executory on [broker's]\r\n     part  after  it had  produced the  buyer.  . .  . [T]he\r\n     critical question  is whether [broker] was  required to\r                                                                   \r\n     perform such services in  order to earn its commission.\r\n     [Emphasis in original.]\r\n\n     In short, we are  unable to find clear error  in the finding\r\n\nof  the  bankruptcy court  that  appellants  had completed  their\r\n\nservices  under the contract before  the filing date.   This also\r\n\nmeans that, as of the filing date, the brokerage contract was not\r\n\nexecutory and could not be  assumed by the debtor.  As  the Third\r\n\nCircuit has commented, in a similar situation,\r\n\n          In  cases  where the  nonbankrupt party  has fully\r\n     performed, it  makes no sense to  talk about assumption\r\n     or rejection.  . . .  Rejection is meaningless  in this\r\n     context, and assumption would  be of no benefit  to the\r\n     estate, serving only to convert the nonbankrupt's claim\r\n     into a  first  priority expense  of  the state  at  the\r\n     expense of the other creditors.

We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Findings and Conclusions Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings of fact of the bankruptcy court, affirmed by the district court, are the following.  One of the debtors, Springfield Post Road Corp., owned land constituting part of a strip type shopping mall in Springfield, Massachusetts.  The remaining portion was leased under a ground lease to the other debtor, Route 20-21 Associates, Inc. The president of both debtors was Melvin Getlan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1991 Getlan asked Gallivan, a real estate broker specializing in finding national restaurant chains as buyers or lessees of property, to obtain a tenant for one of the mall's buildings.  Getlan agreed to pay a commission of seven percent of gross rental for years one through ten of any lease, payable on the commencement of construction.  Through Smith, another broker with experience in finding restaurant chains, Gallivan pursued The Olive Garden, a restaurant chain operating as a division of General Mills Restaurants, Inc. Gallivan and Smith agreed on an even split of the commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After two years, a lease was signed by debtors on May 17, 1993 and by General Mills on June 17, 1993.  The lease envisaged the razing of the existing building and the construction of a new one.  The lease was to commence after General Mills gave notice that all conditions had been met or waived.  Conditions included issuance of a liquor license and building permit, approval of a site plan by Marshall's, the debtors' largest tenant, and the execution of nondisturbance agreements by prior mortgagees.  The seven percent brokerage commission came to $66,780.  On June 25, 1993 the debtors filed petitions under Chapter 11 and continued in possession.  Smith and Gallivan, although claiming to have worked seventy or eighty hours on lease-associated matters after the filing of the petitions, were found to have \"devoted perhaps twenty-five hours\" post petition, primarily to obtaining approval of the site plan.  Several months after filing, construction of the new building commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most critical findings were that, under the oral brokerage agreement, \"the commission was to be earned when the lease was signed and was to become payable when construction commenced;\" and that whatever services were performed by appellants after the Chapter 11 petitions were filed were gratuitous and not required by their agreement, but were rendered in their own interest to \"facilitate consummation of the transaction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held, with respect to the claim under &#167; 503(b), that, since appellants' post-petition services were not required by the brokerage agreement, they were not \"actual, necessary costs\" of preserving the estate or \"commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case.\"   The same fact findings dictated an alternate conclusion, that the contract between the debtors and plaintiffs could not be viewed as an executory contract at the time of filing, which could later be assumed by the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court cited four grounds in support of its refusal to apply &#167; 506(c):  (1) that the statute contemplates only required post-petition services;  (2) that plaintiffs lacked standing, since the statute specifies only that \"The trustee may recover ...\" (emphasis added), and no special circumstances existed, such as was the case in In re Parque Forestal, Inc., 949 F.2d 504, 511 (1st Cir.1991);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  (3) that the direct and intended beneficiaries of any services were the debtors, not the secured party;  and (4) that any services rendered by appellants merely \"enhanced, rather than preserved\" the collateral secured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did not reach or deal with the debtors' alternative claim for restitution, since this depended on the prior existence of an executory agreement, which the court had rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before commencing our analysis, we think it is useful to place appellants' claims in perspective.  The issue is not one which should be viewed in isolation, outside of the established metes and bounds of bankruptcy law.  That is, it is beside the point to consider whether able, persistent, resourceful real estate brokers, who not only found a ready, willing, and able lessee, but worked to assure the satisfaction of a number of conditions of the lease, are entitled to their commission.  Rather, we are dealing with a debt owed by an estate within the realm of bankruptcy, with its various rules to assist in making the least unfair allocation of inadequate resources among contesting creditors.  The precise question is whether the post-petition services of these appellants were so bargained for or so crucially indispensable as to elevate what would otherwise be an unsecured claim to a priority claim that must be paid before those of other unpaid pre-petition suppliers of goods and services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis by addressing appellants' legal proposition having to do with our standard of review.  They contend that whether or not post-filing performance was required of the brokers is not only a question of law, but of state (Massachusetts) law.  Appellants cite such cases as Bennett v. McCabe, 808 F.2d 178 (1st Cir.1987) and Tristram's Landing, Inc. v. Wait, 367 Mass. 622, 327 N.E.2d 727 (1975) for the proposition that real estate brokers earn their commissions, absent breach of contract by their principals, when the transaction has been completed, not when the purchase and sale (or lease) agreement is executed.  This proposition, say appellants, is binding on the bankruptcy court, forecloses any fact finding, is reviewable de novo, and warrants reversal of the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  Appellants, it seems to us, have misconceived the thrust of the authorities cited, as well as the source of governing law.  In Bennett we were addressing the sole question whether, under current Massachusetts law, an unintended, innocent seller's default resulting in the frustration of a transaction would justify the seller's refusal to honor an agreed upon broker's commission.  Bennett, 808 F.2d at 179-80.  Tristram's Landing announced the basic proposition that when a commission is payable \"on the sale,\" a broker is not entitled to a commission until the transaction is completed.  Tristram's Landing, 367 Mass. at 626, 327 N.E.2d 727.   But there the court made very clear that it was not defining an obligation of the broker, but rather was dealing with a special agreement or circumstance \"wherein consummation of the sale became a condition precedent for the broker to earn his commission.\"  Id. at 627, 327 N.E.2d 727.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This difference was explicitly recognized in In re Munple, Ltd., 868 F.2d 1129, 1130-31 (9th Cir.1989), where a purchase and sale agreement provided that a broker's commission was to be payable \"at the close of escrow.\"   The conclusion of the deal was delayed by a dispute between seller and buyer.  The seller then filed under Chapter 11;  the two parties finally composed their differences and the seller then sought to assume the purchase agreement free and clear of the broker's claim for commission.  The broker argued that the agreement was executory, and thus had been assumed by the estate because payment was contingent on the closing of the sale.  The Court of Appeals observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>This argument confuses performance obligations and conditions precedent....  The condition precedent to [seller's] obligation to pay the commission imposed no further obligations on [broker], nonperformance of which would have excused [seller] from paying the commission.  Because [broker] had done everything required of it to earn the commission, the commission provision in the purchase agreement was not executory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore do not agree that these cases support appellants' claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the governing statute in this case is 11 U.S.C. &#167; 503(b).  Its requirements are to be assessed under federal law.  In re Munple, Ltd., 868 F.2d at 1130.   As we have held in In re Mammoth Mart, Inc., 536 F.2d 950, 954 (1st Cir.1976) with reference to the predecessor of &#167; 503(b),</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>It is ... clear that a claimant who fully performs under a contract prior to the filing of the petition will not be entitled to first priority even though his services may have resulted in a direct benefit to the bankrupt after the filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is not foreclosed under &#167; 503(b) is an executory contract, which may be assumed by the debtor.  Federal courts have pretty generally settled upon the following definition of an executory contract:  \"a contract under which the obligation[s] of both the bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing performance of the other.\"  In re Columbia Gas System Inc., 50 F.3d 233, 239 (3d Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore proceed with our review for clear error of the bankruptcy court's finding that the brokers' bargained-for work had been done as of the filing of the petitions and that subsequent efforts were gratuitous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallivan's testimony was that not only was the fee set at seven percent, but that in dealing with ground leases (leases where a tenant must construct his own improvement on the land leased), \"There are a number of conditions that a broker has to perform .... [s]uch as site plan, hazardous waste, in this case nondisturbance, liquor licenses.\"   A broker is, he further testified, entitled to a ground lease commission \"normally\" upon the initiating of construction, when all the conditions have been met.  Later, when he told Smith of the terms of the agreement, he referred to the \"payable upon construction\" term, saying, \"[H]e and I have done a number of restaurant deals and that's fairly common in our industry.\"   He said that Getlan had indicated his agreement to a seven percent fee, payable on construction.  No specific conditions were identified as having been discussed.  The lease itself, signed well after the discussions, contained some dozen conditions, some requiring action from the landlord, some from the tenant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Getlan testified that he had never accepted a letter of agreement that the brokers had prepared.  He even denied that he had agreed on the fee and time of payment;  on these points the court found against him.  He said he normally did not settle on commission details before he had a live tenant before him, and that every deal was different.  As for discussing services in addition to finding a tenant, Getlan acknowledged that it was normal for brokers to do what they could in their own best interest.  He, however, thought that The Olive Garden chain had their own resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked if he discussed with Gallivan help in getting other approvals, he said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>THE WITNESS:  He volunteered to help, if necessary, with the building department to get any permits or find out what was needed or what.  He volunteered for that and I assume he did whatever he was asked to do by them or he may have done something on his own, I don't know.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Did you ask him to do anything ... ?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>THE WITNESS:  I don't think I asked him to do anything personally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, we cannot find clear error in the court's determination that appellants had earned their commission in the sense that they had done all that they were obligated to do prior to the debtors' filing and that their further efforts were gratuitous.  We have already noted Getlan's comments with regard to any work done in pursuing various governmental permits, such as liquor licenses.  The major efforts, according to the court, were directed toward obtaining the approval of Marshalls to the site plan.  Here, the court could reasonably find that the basic approval had been given before execution of the lease and that the delay in getting written approval of details long settled was occasioned by a complete change of staff in the relevant office of Marshalls.  Similarly, Getlan performed whatever work was necessary to get the mortgagees to execute nondisturbance agreements, insofar as the mortgagees were involved.  Smith's efforts were directed toward persuading the tenant that it could live with what the first mortgagee had insisted on.  And there is no evidence that these services, as well as the others, were requested by Getlan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The efforts expended by appellants, post petition, are reminiscent of those of the brokers in In re Munple, Ltd., 868 F.2d at 1131:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>[Broker] contends that the purchase agreement \"authorized\" it to render such services and gave it a \"strong incentive\" to help close the deal because payment of the commission was contingent on closing.  [Citation omitted.]  Even if true, these facts do not render the commission agreement executory on [broker's] part after it had produced the buyer....  [T]he critical question is whether [broker] was required to perform such services in order to earn its commission.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we are unable to find clear error in the finding of the bankruptcy court that appellants had completed their services under the contract before the filing date.  This also means that, as of the filing date, the brokerage contract was not executory and could not be assumed by the debtor.  As the Third Circuit has commented, in a similar situation,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases where the nonbankrupt party has fully performed, it makes no sense to talk about assumption or rejection....  Rejection is meaningless in this context, and assumption would be of no benefit to the estate, serving only to convert the nonbankrupt's claim into a first priority expense of the state at the expense of the other creditors.

Without reaching other grounds relied on by the lower courts, we think it sufficient to hold that the finding that the direct and intended beneficiaries of appellants' services was the debtor, and not the secured party, was supported by the evidence.  The mere fact that revenues from the lease would help the debtors to meet mortgage payments due MBL does not suffice to carry appellants' burden.

We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Findings and Conclusions Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The findings of fact of the bankruptcy court, affirmed by the district court, are the following.  One of the debtors, Springfield Post Road Corp., owned land constituting part of a strip type shopping mall in Springfield, Massachusetts.  The remaining portion was leased under a ground lease to the other debtor, Route 20-21 Associates, Inc. The president of both debtors was Melvin Getlan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1991 Getlan asked Gallivan, a real estate broker specializing in finding national restaurant chains as buyers or lessees of property, to obtain a tenant for one of the mall's buildings.  Getlan agreed to pay a commission of seven percent of gross rental for years one through ten of any lease, payable on the commencement of construction.  Through Smith, another broker with experience in finding restaurant chains, Gallivan pursued The Olive Garden, a restaurant chain operating as a division of General Mills Restaurants, Inc. Gallivan and Smith agreed on an even split of the commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After two years, a lease was signed by debtors on May 17, 1993 and by General Mills on June 17, 1993.  The lease envisaged the razing of the existing building and the construction of a new one.  The lease was to commence after General Mills gave notice that all conditions had been met or waived.  Conditions included issuance of a liquor license and building permit, approval of a site plan by Marshall's, the debtors' largest tenant, and the execution of nondisturbance agreements by prior mortgagees.  The seven percent brokerage commission came to $66,780.  On June 25, 1993 the debtors filed petitions under Chapter 11 and continued in possession.  Smith and Gallivan, although claiming to have worked seventy or eighty hours on lease-associated matters after the filing of the petitions, were found to have \"devoted perhaps twenty-five hours\" post petition, primarily to obtaining approval of the site plan.  Several months after filing, construction of the new building commenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most critical findings were that, under the oral brokerage agreement, \"the commission was to be earned when the lease was signed and was to become payable when construction commenced;\" and that whatever services were performed by appellants after the Chapter 11 petitions were filed were gratuitous and not required by their agreement, but were rendered in their own interest to \"facilitate consummation of the transaction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held, with respect to the claim under &#167; 503(b), that, since appellants' post-petition services were not required by the brokerage agreement, they were not \"actual, necessary costs\" of preserving the estate or \"commissions for services rendered after the commencement of the case.\"   The same fact findings dictated an alternate conclusion, that the contract between the debtors and plaintiffs could not be viewed as an executory contract at the time of filing, which could later be assumed by the estate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court cited four grounds in support of its refusal to apply &#167; 506(c):  (1) that the statute contemplates only required post-petition services;  (2) that plaintiffs lacked standing, since the statute specifies only that \"The trustee may recover ...\" (emphasis added), and no special circumstances existed, such as was the case in In re Parque Forestal, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572408\"><a href=\"/opinion/572408/in-re-parque-forestal-inc-debtor-appeal-of-oriental-federal-savings/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">504</span></a></span>, 511 (1st Cir.1991);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  (3) that the direct and intended beneficiaries of any services were the debtors, not the secured party;  and (4) that any services rendered by appellants merely \"enhanced, rather than preserved\" the collateral secured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did not reach or deal with the debtors' alternative claim for restitution, since this depended on the prior existence of an executory agreement, which the court had rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before commencing our analysis, we think it is useful to place appellants' claims in perspective.  The issue is not one which should be viewed in isolation, outside of the established metes and bounds of bankruptcy law.  That is, it is beside the point to consider whether able, persistent, resourceful real estate brokers, who not only found a ready, willing, and able lessee, but worked to assure the satisfaction of a number of conditions of the lease, are entitled to their commission.  Rather, we are dealing with a debt owed by an estate within the realm of bankruptcy, with its various rules to assist in making the least unfair allocation of inadequate resources among contesting creditors.  The precise question is whether the post-petition services of these appellants were so bargained for or so crucially indispensable as to elevate what would otherwise be an unsecured claim to a priority claim that must be paid before those of other unpaid pre-petition suppliers of goods and services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis by addressing appellants' legal proposition having to do with our standard of review.  They contend that whether or not post-filing performance was required of the brokers is not only a question of law, but of state (Massachusetts) law.  Appellants cite such cases as Bennett v. McCabe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"480986\"><a href=\"/opinion/480986/john-e-bennett-dba-bennett-realty-etc-v-james-p-mccabe-and-john-m/\"><span class=\"volume\">808</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1987) and Tristram's Landing, Inc. v. Wait, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2080288\"><a href=\"/opinion/2080288/tristrams-landing-inc-v-wait/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2080288\"><a href=\"/opinion/2080288/tristrams-landing-inc-v-wait/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span> (1975) for the proposition that real estate brokers earn their commissions, absent breach of contract by their principals, when the transaction has been completed, not when the purchase and sale (or lease) agreement is executed.  This proposition, say appellants, is binding on the bankruptcy court, forecloses any fact finding, is reviewable de novo, and warrants reversal of the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We disagree.  Appellants, it seems to us, have misconceived the thrust of the authorities cited, as well as the source of governing law.  In Bennett we were addressing the sole question whether, under current Massachusetts law, an unintended, innocent seller's default resulting in the frustration of a transaction would justify the seller's refusal to honor an agreed upon broker's commission.  Bennett, 808 F.2d at 179-80.  Tristram's Landing announced the basic proposition that when a commission is payable \"on the sale,\" a broker is not entitled to a commission until the transaction is completed.  Tristram's Landing, 367 Mass. at 626, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2080288\"><a href=\"/opinion/2080288/tristrams-landing-inc-v-wait/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>.   But there the court made very clear that it was not defining an obligation of the broker, but rather was dealing with a special agreement or circumstance \"wherein consummation of the sale became a condition precedent for the broker to earn his commission.\"  Id. at 627, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2080288\"><a href=\"/opinion/2080288/tristrams-landing-inc-v-wait/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This difference was explicitly recognized in In re Munple, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518949\"><a href=\"/opinion/518949/in-re-munple-ltd-a-california-limited-partnership-debtor-marcus/\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span>, 1130-31 (9th Cir.1989), where a purchase and sale agreement provided that a broker's commission was to be payable \"at the close of escrow.\"   The conclusion of the deal was delayed by a dispute between seller and buyer.  The seller then filed under Chapter 11;  the two parties finally composed their differences and the seller then sought to assume the purchase agreement free and clear of the broker's claim for commission.  The broker argued that the agreement was executory, and thus had been assumed by the estate because payment was contingent on the closing of the sale.  The Court of Appeals observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>This argument confuses performance obligations and conditions precedent....  The condition precedent to [seller's] obligation to pay the commission imposed no further obligations on [broker], nonperformance of which would have excused [seller] from paying the commission.  Because [broker] had done everything required of it to earn the commission, the commission provision in the purchase agreement was not executory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore do not agree that these cases support appellants' claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the governing statute in this case is 11 U.S.C. &#167; 503(b).  Its requirements are to be assessed under federal law.  In re Munple, Ltd., 868 F.2d at 1130.   As we have held in In re Mammoth Mart, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"336186\"><a href=\"/opinion/336186/in-re-mammoth-mart-inc-debtor-stanley-cramer-v-mammoth-mart-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></a></span>, 954 (1st Cir.1976) with reference to the predecessor of &#167; 503(b),</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>It is ... clear that a claimant who fully performs under a contract prior to the filing of the petition will not be entitled to first priority even though his services may have resulted in a direct benefit to the bankrupt after the filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is not foreclosed under &#167; 503(b) is an executory contract, which may be assumed by the debtor.  Federal courts have pretty generally settled upon the following definition of an executory contract:  \"a contract under which the obligation[s] of both the bankrupt and the other party to the contract are so far unperformed that the failure of either to complete performance would constitute a material breach excusing performance of the other.\"  In re Columbia Gas System Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691967\"><a href=\"/opinion/691967/in-re-columbia-gas-system-inc-columbia-gas-transmission-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">233</span></a></span>, 239 (3d Cir.1995) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore proceed with our review for clear error of the bankruptcy court's finding that the brokers' bargained-for work had been done as of the filing of the petitions and that subsequent efforts were gratuitous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gallivan's testimony was that not only was the fee set at seven percent, but that in dealing with ground leases (leases where a tenant must construct his own improvement on the land leased), \"There are a number of conditions that a broker has to perform .... [s]uch as site plan, hazardous waste, in this case nondisturbance, liquor licenses.\"   A broker is, he further testified, entitled to a ground lease commission \"normally\" upon the initiating of construction, when all the conditions have been met.  Later, when he told Smith of the terms of the agreement, he referred to the \"payable upon construction\" term, saying, \"[H]e and I have done a number of restaurant deals and that's fairly common in our industry.\"   He said that Getlan had indicated his agreement to a seven percent fee, payable on construction.  No specific conditions were identified as having been discussed.  The lease itself, signed well after the discussions, contained some dozen conditions, some requiring action from the landlord, some from the tenant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Getlan testified that he had never accepted a letter of agreement that the brokers had prepared.  He even denied that he had agreed on the fee and time of payment;  on these points the court found against him.  He said he normally did not settle on commission details before he had a live tenant before him, and that every deal was different.  As for discussing services in addition to finding a tenant, Getlan acknowledged that it was normal for brokers to do what they could in their own best interest.  He, however, thought that The Olive Garden chain had their own resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked if he discussed with Gallivan help in getting other approvals, he said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>THE WITNESS:  He volunteered to help, if necessary, with the building department to get any permits or find out what was needed or what.  He volunteered for that and I assume he did whatever he was asked to do by them or he may have done something on his own, I don't know.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>THE COURT:  Did you ask him to do anything ... ?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>THE WITNESS:  I don't think I asked him to do anything personally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, we cannot find clear error in the court's determination that appellants had earned their commission in the sense that they had done all that they were obligated to do prior to the debtors' filing and that their further efforts were gratuitous.  We have already noted Getlan's comments with regard to any work done in pursuing various governmental permits, such as liquor licenses.  The major efforts, according to the court, were directed toward obtaining the approval of Marshalls to the site plan.  Here, the court could reasonably find that the basic approval had been given before execution of the lease and that the delay in getting written approval of details long settled was occasioned by a complete change of staff in the relevant office of Marshalls.  Similarly, Getlan performed whatever work was necessary to get the mortgagees to execute nondisturbance agreements, insofar as the mortgagees were involved.  Smith's efforts were directed toward persuading the tenant that it could live with what the first mortgagee had insisted on.  And there is no evidence that these services, as well as the others, were requested by Getlan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The efforts expended by appellants, post petition, are reminiscent of those of the brokers in In re Munple, Ltd., 868 F.2d at 1131:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>[Broker] contends that the purchase agreement \"authorized\" it to render such services and gave it a \"strong incentive\" to help close the deal because payment of the commission was contingent on closing.  [Citation omitted.]  Even if true, these facts do not render the commission agreement executory on [broker's] part after it had produced the buyer....  [T]he critical question is whether [broker] was required to perform such services in order to earn its commission.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we are unable to find clear error in the finding of the bankruptcy court that appellants had completed their services under the contract before the filing date.  This also means that, as of the filing date, the brokerage contract was not executory and could not be assumed by the debtor.  As the Third Circuit has commented, in a similar situation,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases where the nonbankrupt party has fully performed, it makes no sense to talk about assumption or rejection....  Rejection is meaningless in this context, and assumption would be of no benefit to the estate, serving only to convert the nonbankrupt's claim into a first priority expense of the state at the expense of the other creditors.  [Citation omitted.]  In re Columbia Gas System, Inc., 50 F.3d at 239.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claim under &#167; 503(b) was, therefore, properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address briefly the claim under &#167; 506(c).  Without reaching other grounds relied on by the lower courts, we think it sufficient to hold that the finding that the direct and intended beneficiaries of appellants' services was the debtor, and not the secured party, was supported by the evidence.  The mere fact that revenues from the lease would help the debtors to meet mortgage payments due MBL does not suffice to carry appellants' burden.
