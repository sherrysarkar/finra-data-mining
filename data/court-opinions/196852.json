Gentile on Motion for Summary Judgment for appellee.\r                            \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n     Per Curiam.   We have  reviewed carefully the  record in\r                           \r\r\n\nthis  case,  including  the  transcript of  appellant  Dennis\r\n\nEvans' disciplinary  hearing.  We summarily  affirm the grant\r\n\nof summary judgment to appellees.  \r\n\n     Even if  we assume  without  deciding that  Evans has  a\r\n\nconstitutionally  protected  liberty  interest  in  good time\r\n\ncredits, he  has still failed  to allege sufficient  facts to\r\n\nsupport a claim that  his rights to federal due  process were\r\n\nviolated.  \r\n\n     First, under federal due process standards, an inmate is\r\n\nentitled  to notice of the charges against him, not to notice\r\n\nof each  item of evidence which  may be offered to  prove the\r\n\ncharges.   Consequently, providing an  inmate with a  copy of\r\n\nthe disciplinary report satisfies due process. See Langton v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nBerman, 667  F.2d 231,  234 (1st  Cir. 1981).     Since Evans\r                  \r\n\nadmits  that he  received timely  copies of  the disciplinary\r\n\nreport  against him  prior to  the disciplinary  hearing, his\r\n\nclaim is without merit.1  \r                                   1\r\n\n     Second, Evans  alleges that  he was  denied  a right  to\r\n\npresent witnesses in  his own defense.   However, the  record\r\n\nindicates   that  Evans   made  only   a  reference   at  his\r\n\ndisciplinary hearing to a desire  to call prison officials as\r\n\nwitnesses  and that  this claim was  not pressed.   Moreover,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1Evans' allegation  that  the notice  violated the  Morris\r               1\r\nrules is not of federal constitutional dimension, and  such a\r\nviolation,  in and of  itself, is not  a sufficient predicate\r\nfor a federal due process claim.  \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\neven if we assume that the board erred in  not allowing Evans\r\n\nto call these witnesses, the error was harmless.  \r\n\n     The   only  information   those  witnesses   could  have\r\n\nprovided, according to Evans, is that they had not seen Evans\r\n\nhave  more   than  minimal  contact  with   his  alleged  co-\r\n\nconspirator in  the time immediately preceding  the discovery\r\n\nof the escape attempt.  Since Evans makes no claim that these\r\n\nwitnesses   were   present   at   all  times   during   which\r\n\ncommunication between Evans and his co-conspirator could have\r\n\noccurred, their  testimony would have done  little to sustain\r\n\nEvans' claim.  Since Evans has not shown that he suffered any\r\n\nprejudice from his inability to  call these witnesses, he has\r\n\nfailed to  show any violation of his due process rights.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nForbes v. Trigg, 976  F.2d 308, 318 (7th Cir.  1992) (failure\r                           \r\n\nto allow inmate to call witnesses did not violate due process\r\n\nsince \"[t]heir testimony could  have added little\"); see also\r                                                                         \r\n\nWolff v.  McDonnell, 418  U.S. 539, 566  (1974) (disciplinary\r                               \r\n\nboard   may  deny   request   for  witness   on  grounds   of\r\n\nirrelevance).\r\n\n     Evans'  third  claim  is  that  there  was  insufficient\r\n\nevidence  in the record to support the finding of guilt.  The\r\n\nonly   witness  upon   which   the  board   relied  was   the\r\n\ninvestigating officer, who related to the board the testimony\r\n\nof  two   confidential  informants  and   vouched  for  their\r\n\nreliability. \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     When  a  disciplinary board's  finding  of  guilt relies\r\n\nprimarily   on  the  evidence   provided  by  a  confidential\r\n\ninformant, due process requires  that the board have adequate\r\n\ninformation from which it  could reasonably conclude that the\r\n\ninformant's evidence was reliable.   See Langton, 667 F.2d at\r                                                            \r\n\n235.    We find  that the  board had  a sufficient  basis for\r\n\nfinding that  the informants'  testimony met  the reliability\r\n\nrequirement in this case.\r\n\n     In his testimony to the board, the investigating officer\r\n\nmade clear that his information about the escape attempt came\r\n\nfrom  two separate  informants  and that  each informant  had\r\n\nprovided reliable information in the past.  He also testified\r\n\nthat  physical  evidence (escape  tools)  were  found in  the\r\n\npossession  of  one of  the  informants.   An  investigator's\r\n\npersonal testimony of  what a confidential informant  stated,\r\n\nalong  with  his  statement  that the  informant  had  proved\r\n\nreliable in  the  past, is  usually  sufficient to  meet  the\r\n\nreliability requirement of Wolff.  See Hensley v. Wilson, 850\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  269, 277  (6th Cir.  1988) (\"[a]t  a very  minimum, the\r\n\ninvestigator  must report  that  a  particular informant  has\r\n\nproved reliable  in specific  past instances\");  Zimmerlee v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nKeeney,  831 F.2d 183, 187 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 487\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 1207  (1988)  (\"that an  informant  previously  supplied\r\n\nreliable information  is sufficient\"); Dawson  v. Smith,  719\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 896, 899  (7th Cir.  1983), cert. denied,  466 U.S.  929\r                                                         \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n(1984) (same); Kyle  v.

We find  that it\r\n\nis so in the instant case, especially since physical evidence\r\n\nwas found which corroborated this information. \r\n\n     The   judgment  of  the   district  court  is  summarily\r\n\naffirmed.

We find that the board had a sufficient basis for finding that the informants' testimony met the reliability requirement in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his testimony to the board, the investigating officer made clear that his information about the escape attempt came from two separate informants and that each informant had provided reliable information in the past.   He also testified that physical evidence (escape tools) were found in the possession of one of the informants.   An investigator's personal testimony of what a confidential informant stated, along with his statement that the informant had proved reliable in the past, is usually sufficient to meet the reliability requirement of Wolff.
