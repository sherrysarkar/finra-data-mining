Defendant Susan  DelVecchio brings two\r                      Per Curiam.\r\n\nchallenges  to her sentence, one  of which this  court has no\r\n\njurisdiction  to entertain,  the other  of which  was waived.\r\n\nDefendant  was  sentenced to  46  months  imprisonment to  be\r\n\nfollowed  by  three years  of  supervised  release after  she\r\n\npleaded  guilty to  three charges  of cocaine  possession and\r\n\ndistribution.\r\n\n          DelVecchio's first  challenge  is to  the  district\r\n\ncourt's failure  to grant her  a downward departure  based on\r\n\nassertedly unusual circumstances -- including her history  of\r\n\ndepression,  a  suicide attempt,  sexual  abuse  by a  family\r\n\nfriend  and  physical  and  emotional  abuse  by  her  former\r\n\nhusbands.   DelVecchio  argues these  circumstances took  her\r\n\ncase  outside of  the  \"heartland\" of  cases  covered by  the\r\n\nSentencing Guidelines, see United  States v. Rivera, 994 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n942  (1st Cir.  1993), and  that the  district court  was not\r\n\nfully aware of its ability  to make a discretionary  downward\r\n\ndeparture based on these circumstances.  However, it is clear\r\n\nfrom  the  record that  the  experienced  district court  did\r\n\nindeed understand  its authority  to depart downward.   After\r\n\nhearing  defense  counsel's  argument regarding  Rivera,  the\r                                                                   \r\n\ndistrict court stated, \"I  don't see any facts in  here which\r\n\nwould  justify me to  go below the  guideline range. .  . . I\r\n\nhave the authority,  of course . . . .\"   The court concluded\r\n\nthat it did not \"find the facts and circumstances which would\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nwarrant\" a downward departure.   It is settled law  that this\r\n\ncourt  does  not have  jurisdiction  to  review the  district\r\n\ncourt's refusal  to exercise its  discretionary authority  to\r\n\ngrant a downward departure.  E.g., United States v. Lewis, 40\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 1325, 1345 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          Defendant also raises several arguments surrounding\r\n\nthe  government's  decision  not   to  move  for  a  downward\r\n\ndeparture  pursuant to U.S.S.G.    5K1.1 (Nov.  1994).  Under\r\n\nthe terms of her plea agreement, the government had agreed to\r\n\nconsider  filing  such a  motion  if  the defendant  provided\r\n\nsubstantial assistance in the \"investigation  and prosecution\r\n\nof another person.\"  The decision whether to file the motion,\r\n\nit  was  agreed, was  in  the discretion  of  the government.\r\n\nBecause   the  government  determined   that  the  assistance\r\n\nDelVecchio did provide was \"unavailing\"  and not substantial,\r\n\nit declined to file the motion.\r\n\n          DelVecchio now argues, among other points, that the\r\n\ngovernment's refusal to file  the motion and its drafting  of\r\n\nthe agreement were done in \"bad faith\" allegedly in violation\r\n\nof law and that the district court erred in refusing to grant\r\n\na downward departure.   The fatal flaw in these  arguments is\r\n\nthat  the  defendant failed  to  raise them  in  the district\r\n\ncourt,  and we  decline to  entertain them  now.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States  v. Carvell,      F.3d    ,     , No.  95-1606,\r                                     \r\n\nslip op. at 15 (1st Cir. Jan. 19, 1996) (\"[I]ssues not raised\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nbelow  will not  be heard  on appeal  unless there  was plain\r\n\nerror.\").   Moreover, in  addition to failing  to raise these\r\n\narguments  below, DelVecchio  now  points to  nothing in  the\r\n\nrecord outside  the plea agreement itself  as even indicating\r\n\nbad  faith  or   motive  on  the  part   of  the  government.\r\n\nAccordingly,  we  believe  that   DelVecchio  has  failed  to\r\n\nestablish any  error sufficiently obvious and  substantial to\r\n\nsurvive \"plain error\" review.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n",
