John R. Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\r\n**Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.\r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  In the district court, Garita Hotel claimed\r                           \r\n\nthat  Ponce  Federal Bank  had unconditionally  contracted to\r\n\nlend  Garita $6  million for  the  expansion, renovation  and\r\n\noperation of  a hotel complex  in Carolina, Puerto  Rico, and\r\n\nthat  the bank  breached  that contract  when  it refused  to\r\n\nadvance  funds unless Garita obtained  a casino license.  The\r\n\ndistrict court, acting after a remand from this court, Garita\r                                                                         \r\n\nHotel L.P. v.  Ponce Fed. Bank, 958 F.2d 15 (1st Cir. 1992) ,\r                                          \r\n\ngranted summary judgment  to Ponce Federal.   Garita's appeal\r\n\nto this court followed.\r\n\n     We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\n\nde novo,  drawing reasonable  inferences  in Garita's  favor.\r                   \r\n\nGrenier v.  Vermont Log Bldgs.,  Inc., 96 F.3d 559,  562 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1996).  On the record before the district court, most of\r\n\nthe  undisputed facts strongly suggested that approval of the\r\n\ncasino license had been an understood condition  of the loan.\r\n\nGarita's main  argument to the  contrary rests on  an alleged\r\n\noral  statement to Garita representatives, by a Ponce Federal\r\n\nagent in  September 1986,  that the bank  had \"approved\"  the\r\n\nloan.   Internal  bank  documents  arguably  corroborate  the\r\n\nmaking of this statement.\r\n\n     Under Puerto  Rico law,  a commercial  contract must  be\r\n\ncorroborated,  and this requirement  extends not just  to the\r\n\nexistence of an  agreement but also  to its essential  terms.\r\n\nVila &amp;  Hnos,  Inc. v.  Owens Ill.  de Puerto  Rico, 17  P.R.\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nOffic.  Trans.  987,  997-1000 (1986).    The  district court\r\n\ninvoked this requirement, holding that there was certainly no\r\n\ncorroboration for the claim that  the bank had agreed to make\r\n\nthe loan unconditionally  and without regard to  the approval\r\n\nof the  casino license.   On appeal,  Garita argues  that the\r\n\nloan  agreement  should   not  have  been  classified   as  a\r\n\ncommercial contract.\r\n\n     A Puerto  Rican statutory  provision defines  a loan  as\r\n\ncommercial if (1) at least one party is a \"merchant\"  and (2)\r\n\nthe loan proceeds \"are destined to  commercial transactions.\"\r\n\n10  L.P.R.A.    1651;  see id.     1001 (defining  merchant).\r                                          \r\n\nHere, where an established bank proposed to extend a  sizable\r\n\nloan  to an experienced  hotel and casino  management company\r\n\nfor  the purpose of renovating and  operating a luxury hotel-\r\n\ncasino  complex,  we  agree  with  the  district  court  that\r\n\nwhatever contract the  parties may have formed  is commercial\r\n\nin nature under  Puerto Rican law.  See  FDIC v. Consolidated\r                                                                         \r\n\nMortgage &amp; Fin. Corp., 805 F.2d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1986).\r                                 \r\n\n     Garita contends that the loan was not commercial because\r\n\nit  was  extended  for  a  purpose  (hotel  renovation)  that\r\n\ndiffered   from   Garita's    traditional   business   (hotel\r\n\nmanagement).  It is true that courts have found noncommercial\r\n\ntransactions  where  borrowed funds  were  used  for personal\r\n\npurposes, see, e.g., FDIC v. Martinez Almodavar, 671 F. Supp.\r                                                           \r\n\n851, 868-70 (D.P.R. 1987); or  where the loan was  apparently\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nmade for largely  personal reasons, see, e.g., Barcel   &amp; Co.\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Olmo Reyes, 48  P.R.R. 239, 241-42 (1935).   But any  loan\r                         \r\n\nagreement  between Garita  and  Ponce  Federal  was  for  the\r\n\nclearly commercial purpose  of real estate development.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nConsolidated Mortgage, 805 F.2d at 18.\r                                 \r\n\n     Garita  also relies  on  FDIC  v.  Francisco  Investment\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp.,  638  F.  Supp.  1216 (D.P.R.  1986),  rev'd  on other\r                                                                         \r\n\ngrounds, 873 F.2d  474 (1st Cir. 1989).   There, the district\r                   \r\n\ncourt  held  that  a  loan  to a  corporation  controlled  by\r\n\ndoctors, who borrowed the money to  buy all the shares of  an\r\n\nincorporated  nursing  home,  intending to  operate  it  as a\r\n\nhospital or other medical facility, was not commercial.  This\r\n\ncourt had no  occasion to resolve the issue.   Francisco, 873\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d at 476.\r\n\n     Francisco  rested heavily  on  the  notion that  medical\r                          \r\n\npractice was inherently  not a  \"commercial\" endeavor  within\r\n\nthe  specialized meaning of  section 1651, Francisco,  638 F.\r                                                                \r\n\nSupp. at 1218-19,  a notion that has little  application to a\r\n\nhotel and  casino company  proposing a new  hotel and  casino\r\n\nventure.  There  is some language in  Francisco arguably more\r                                                           \r\n\nhelpful to  Garita, but that  language may itself be  in some\r\n\ntension with Puerto Rico case  law indicating that a loan may\r\n\nbe \"commercial\" even though the planned use of  funds differs\r\n\nfrom  the borrower's historical business.   See, e.g., Vila &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nHnos,  17  P.R.  Offic. Trans.  at  990,  995-96 (corporation\r                \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nengaged  in transportation of sand and stone sought financing\r\n\nto purchase property capable of supplying these materials).\r\n\n     Thus,  we agree  with the district  court that  the loan\r\n\nagreement in  this case was  a commercial contract  for which\r\n\ncorroborating  evidence was required  as to the  existence of\r\n\nthe agreement and its essential terms.  Nothing in the record\r\n\ncorroborates Garita's contention that Ponce Federal agreed to\r\n\na  loan  regardless  of government  approval  of  the planned\r\n\ncasino.

Here, where an established bank proposed to extend a sizable loan to an experienced hotel and casino management company for the purpose of renovating and operating a luxury hotel-casino complex, we agree with the district court that whatever contract the parties may have formed is commercial in nature under Puerto Rican law.

There, the district court held that a loan to a corporation controlled by doctors, who borrowed the money to buy all the shares of an incorporated nursing home, intending to operate it as a hospital or other medical facility, was not commercial.

There is some language in Francisco arguably more helpful to Garita, but that language may itself be in some tension with Puerto Rico case law indicating that a loan may be \"commercial\" even though the planned use of funds differs from the borrower's historical business.

Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578672\"><a href=\"/opinion/578672/garita-hotel-limited-partnership-etc-v-ponce-federal-bank-fsb/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1992), granted summary judgment to Ponce Federal.  Garita's appeal to this court followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, drawing reasonable inferences in Garita's favor.  Grenier v. Vermont Log Bldgs., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726666\"><a href=\"/opinion/726666/robert-b-grenier-v-vermont-log-buildings-inc-third-party-v-dap-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span>, 562 (1st Cir.1996).  On the record before the district court, most of the undisputed facts strongly suggested that approval of the casino license had been an understood condition of the loan.  Garita's main argument to the contrary rests on an alleged oral statement to Garita representatives, by a Ponce Federal agent in September 1986, that the bank had \"approved\" the loan.  Internal bank documents arguably corroborate the making of this statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, a commercial contract must be corroborated, and this requirement extends not just to the existence of an agreement but also to its essential terms.  Vila &amp; Hnos, Inc. v. Owens Ill. de Puerto Rico, 17 P.R. Offic.  Trans. 987, 997-1000 (1986).  The district court invoked this requirement, holding that there was certainly no corroboration for the claim that the bank had agreed to make the loan unconditionally and without regard to the approval of the casino license.  On appeal, Garita argues that the loan agreement should not have been classified as a commercial contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Puerto Rican statutory provision defines a loan as commercial if (1) at least one party is a \"merchant\" and (2) the loan proceeds \"are destined to commercial transactions.\"  10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 1651;  see id. &#167; 1001 (defining merchant).  Here, where an established bank proposed to extend a sizable loan to an experienced hotel and casino management company for the purpose of renovating and operating a luxury hotel-casino complex, we agree with the district court that whatever contract the parties may have formed is commercial in nature under Puerto Rican law.  See FDIC v. Consolidated Mortgage &amp; Fin.  Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"479204\"><a href=\"/opinion/479204/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-v-consolidated-mortgage-and-finance/\"><span class=\"volume\">805</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garita contends that the loan was not commercial because it was extended for a purpose (hotel renovation) that differed from Garita's traditional business (hotel management).  It is true that courts have found noncommercial transactions where borrowed funds were used for personal purposes, see, e.g., FDIC v. Martinez Almodovar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2595180\"><a href=\"/opinion/2595180/federal-deposit-ins-corp-v-martinez-almodovar/\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span>, 868-70 (D.P.R.1987);  or where the loan was apparently made for largely personal reasons, see, e.g., Barcel &amp; Co. v. Olmo Reyes, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></span>, 241-42 (1935).  But any loan agreement between Garita and Ponce Federal was for the clearly commercial purpose of real estate development.  See Consolidated Mortgage, 805 F.2d at 18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garita also relies on FDIC v. Francisco Investment Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1489855\"><a href=\"/opinion/1489855/federal-deposit-ins-corp-v-francisco-inv-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">638</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span> (D.P.R.1986), rev'd on other grounds, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522151\"><a href=\"/opinion/522151/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation-etc-v-francisco-investment/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989).  There, the district court held that a loan to a corporation controlled by doctors, who borrowed the money to buy all the shares of an incorporated nursing home, intending to operate it as a hospital or other medical facility, was not commercial.  This court had no occasion to resolve the issue.  Francisco, 873 F.2d at 476.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Francisco rested heavily on the notion that medical practice was inherently not a \"commercial\" endeavor within the specialized meaning of section 1651, Francisco, 638 F.Supp. at 1218-19, a notion that has little application to a hotel and casino company proposing a new hotel and casino venture.  There is some language in Francisco arguably more helpful to Garita, but that language may itself be in some tension with Puerto Rico case law indicating that a loan may be \"commercial\" even though the planned use of funds differs from the borrower's historical business.  See, e.g., Vila &amp; Hnos, 17 P.R. Offic.  Trans. at 990, 995-96 (corporation engaged in transportation of sand and stone sought financing to purchase property capable of supplying these materials).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we agree with the district court that the loan agreement in this case was a commercial contract for which corroborating evidence was required as to the existence of the agreement and its essential terms.  Nothing in the record corroborates Garita's contention that Ponce Federal agreed to a loan regardless of government approval of the planned casino.  Summary judgment was properly granted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.
