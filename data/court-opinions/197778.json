Essentially for the reasons stated  by the\r                           \r\n\ntax court  in its  order of  dismissal, appellant's  petition\r\n\nproperly was  dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.   We reject\r\n\nappellant's arguments  and conclude,  as did  the tax  court,\r\n\nthat no notice  of deficiency was issued after  1994 and that\r\n\nthe petition  filed in  1997 was untimely  under 26  U.S.C.  \r\n\n6213(a).\r\n\n     Affirmed.
