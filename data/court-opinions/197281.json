This case had its genesis in  racketeering\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\ncharges filed by  the Puerto Rico Department  of Justice (PR-DOJ)\r\n\nagainst,  inter  alia,   Delta  Petroleum  (PR),  Ltd.,   Delta's\r                               \r\n\npresident, (Mario O.  Garcia-Quintero), and Northwestern  Trading\r\n\nCo.   Coincident with the filing of those charges, PR-DOJ seized,\r\n\nwithout   prior  judicial   authorization,   two  bank   accounts\r\n\nmaintained by  Delta.  One such account was held by Banco Central\r\n\nHispa o for the benefit of First National Bank of Boston (Bank of\r\n\nBoston).  The second was held directly by Bank of Boston.\r\n\n          Garcia-Quintero,  Bank  of  Boston,   and  Northwestern\r\n\nTrading  pursued various  avenues of  relief.   During this  time\r\n\nframe,  however,   Delta  became   the  subject  of   Chapter  11\r\n\nproceedings in the bankruptcy court; a trustee was appointed; and\r\n\nBank of Boston opted  to remove an earlier-filed action  from the\r\n\ncommonwealth courts to the bankruptcy court.  In due season, Bank\r\n\nof  Boston  cross-claimed  against   PR-DOJ,  alleging  that  the\r\n\naforementioned seizures were illegal and should be nullified.1\r\n\n          After considerable procedural skirmishing, the district\r\n\ncourt withdrew its earlier reference to the bankruptcy court  and\r\n\nassumed jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding.  Both Bank of\r\n\nBoston and Northwestern Trading  then moved for summary judgment.\r\n\nPR-DOJ did not  file an opposition  to either  motion.  By  order\r\n\ndated  August 9, 1995,  the district  court granted  the motions.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Throughout  this opinion,  we use  \"PR-DOJ\" as  a shorthand\r\nreference for  all appellants (who  include not  only PR-DOJ  but\r\nalso  the Commonwealth  of Puerto  Rico  and divers  officers and\r\nagents of the Commonwealth).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nPR-DOJ  moved for reconsideration, Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), but the\r\n\ncourt, by order dated February 5, 1996, refused to budge.  PR-DOJ\r\n\nnow appeals.  We summarily affirm.\r\n\n          The  district court has  written two  orders explaining\r\n\nits reasoning,  and we see scant  need to wax longiloquent.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nLawton v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co. of Am., 101 F.3d 218, 220\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1996)  (stating that  \"when a  lower court  produces a\r\n\ncomprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate  court should\r\n\nrefrain from writing  at length to no other end  than to hear its\r\n\nown  words resonate\");  In re  San Juan  Dupont Plaza  Hotel Fire\r                                                                           \r\n\nLitig.,  989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993) (similar).  Accordingly,\r                \r\n\nwe affirm  the judgment for substantially  the reasons elucidated\r\n\nin the district court's orders, adding a few brief comments.\r\n\n          1.   It is  important to bear in  mind that this appeal\r                    1.\r\n\ntests only the denial of PR-DOJ's motion for reconsideration.  In\r\n\nconsidering  such  an assignment  of error,  we will  not reverse\r\n\nunless the record displays  a palpable abuse of discretion.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nAir Line Pilots Ass'n v.

PR-DOJ  vigorously  (if  belatedly)  contests  the\r                    2.\r\n\ndistrict court's  jurisdiction, and  urges that the  court should\r\n\nhave  reconsidered because  the removed  action should  have been\r\n\nremanded to the  commonwealth courts.   We need  not address  the\r\n\nobvious  question anent the  existence of  appellate jurisdiction\r\n\nvis- -vis the  denial  of  a  motion  to  remand,  see  generally\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nThermtron  Prods., Inc.  v.  Hermansdorfer, 423  U.S. 336  350-52\r                                                    \r\n\n(1976),  inasmuch  as the  appellant's  attacks  on the  district\r\n\ncourt's subject matter jurisdiction fail.\r\n\n          A  federal court appropriately exercises subject matter\r\n\njurisdiction over state court claims upon removal when the claims\r\n\nare  sufficiently \"related\"  to bankruptcy  proceedings.   See 28\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.    1334, 1452 (1994). \"[T]he  test for determining whether\r\n\na  civil  proceeding is  related  to  bankruptcy  is whether  the\r\n\noutcome of that  proceeding could conceivably have  any effect on\r\n\nthe  estate  being administered  in  bankruptcy.\"   In  re G.S.F.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp.,  938 F.2d  1467, 1475  (1st Cir.  1991) (quoting  Pacor v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nHiggins, 743  F.2d 984, 994 (3d  Cir. 1984)).  In  this case, the\r                 \r\n\ndistrict court properly exercised jurisdiction over the claims to\r\n\ncompel the return of the seized property because those claims had\r\n\na direct and significant  effect on the bankruptcy estate.2   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States  v. Star Rte. Box  1328, 137 B.R. 802,  805 (D. Or.\r                                               \r\n\n1992) (holding  that a  case involving federal  civil forfeitures\r\n\nsatisfied  the  relatedness test).    Moreover,  the claims  were\r\n\nproperly  withdrawn by  the  district court  from the  bankruptcy\r\n\ncourt.  See 28 U.S.C.   157(d) (1994).\r                     \r\n\n          3.     PR-DOJ  offers  as  an   additional  reason  for\r                    3.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2To be  sure, PR-DOJ  emphasizes that the  issues concerning\r\nthe seized  property depend  primarily on Puerto  Rico forfeiture\r\nlaw.    But  \"federal  courts  are  not  lightly  to   relinquish\r\njurisdiction, and  . . . even  a difficult issue of  state law or\r\nparallel pending state litigation  is not automatically a warrant\r\nto abstain.\"  Lundborg v. Phoenix Leasing, Inc., 91 F.3d 265, 272\r                                                         \r\n(1st  Cir. 1996).   Thus, the  district court  did not  abuse its\r\nconsiderable discretion by deeming itself competent to  determine\r\nstraightforward issues of Puerto Rico law.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nreconsideration  its complaint  that the  district court  entered\r\n\nsummary judgment without  offering it an opportunity  to mount an\r\n\nopposition.  This is  sheer persiflage.  The record  reveals that\r\n\nPR-DOJ  had  ample opportunity  to  oppose  the summary  judgment\r\n\nmotions, and  instead neglected  to do  so.3   What is  more, the\r\n\ndistrict court did not grant the motions merely because they were\r\n\nunopposed; rather, the court,  following settled precedent,  see,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g., Kelly v. United States, 924  F.2d 355, 358 (1st Cir. 1991);\r                                      \r\n\nMendez  v.  Banco  Popular,  900  F.2d  4,  7  (1st  Cir.  1990),\r                                    \r\n\nconsidered the motions on their merits, in light of the record as\r\n\nconstituted, and determined that judgment in favor of the movants\r\n\nwas legally appropriate.\r\n\n          The sockdolager,  of course, is that  PR-DOJ, even now,\r\n\nhas not suggested any  credible reason why Bank of  Boston and/or\r\n\nNorthwestern Trading are not entitled to judgment.  The claimants\r\n\nare  parties  possessing  cognizable   interests  in  the  seized\r\n\nproperty.    See P.R.  Laws Ann.  tit. 34,     1723 (1991).   The\r                          \r\n\ncriminal proceedings  fizzled out,  and under  the law  of Puerto\r\n\nRico,  acquittal  on  criminal  charges  renders  a  governmental\r\n\nseizure of  the acquitted person's  property invalid.   See Carlo\r                                                                           \r\n\ndel Toro v.  Secretario de Justicia, 7 P.R. Off. Trans. 392, 398-\r                                             \r\n\n99 (1982).   In the face of  clear precedent, the district  court\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3PR-DOJ's  lament that it was  lulled into a  false sense of\r\nsecurity  by a  stay granted  earlier in  the proceedings  by the\r\nbankruptcy  court holds little water.   Given the  record in this\r\ncase, no  reasonable lawyer would  have concluded  that the  stay\r\nendured  after  the district  court  withdrew  the reference  and\r\nassumed jurisdiction.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nacted appropriately in noticing  the acquittals and striking down\r\n\nthe seizures.\r\n\n          We need go no further.  Concluding, as  we do, that the\r\n\ninstant appeal is entirely without merit, we summarily affirm.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n",

This case had its genesis in  racketeering\r                    Per Curiam.\r                              \r\n\ncharges filed by  the Puerto Rico Department  of Justice (PR-DOJ)\r\n\nagainst,  inter  alia,   Delta  Petroleum  (PR),  Ltd.,   Delta's\r                               \r\n\npresident, (Mario O.  Garcia-Quintero), and Northwestern  Trading\r\n\nCo.   Coincident with the filing of those charges, PR-DOJ seized,\r\n\nwithout   prior  judicial   authorization,   two  bank   accounts\r\n\nmaintained by  Delta.  One such account was held by Banco Central\r\n\nHispa o for the benefit of First National Bank of Boston (Bank of\r\n\nBoston).  The second was held directly by Bank of Boston.\r\n\n          Garcia-Quintero,  Bank  of  Boston,   and  Northwestern\r\n\nTrading  pursued various  avenues of  relief.   During this  time\r\n\nframe,  however,   Delta  became   the  subject  of   Chapter  11\r\n\nproceedings in the bankruptcy court; a trustee was appointed; and\r\n\nBank of Boston opted  to remove an earlier-filed action  from the\r\n\ncommonwealth courts to the bankruptcy court.  In due season, Bank\r\n\nof  Boston  cross-claimed  against   PR-DOJ,  alleging  that  the\r\n\naforementioned seizures were illegal and should be nullified.1\r\n\n          After considerable procedural skirmishing, the district\r\n\ncourt withdrew its earlier reference to the bankruptcy court  and\r\n\nassumed jurisdiction over the adversary proceeding.  Both Bank of\r\n\nBoston and Northwestern Trading  then moved for summary judgment.\r\n\nPR-DOJ did not  file an opposition  to either  motion.  By  order\r\n\ndated  August 9, 1995,  the district  court granted  the motions.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Throughout  this opinion,  we use  \"PR-DOJ\" as  a shorthand\r\nreference for  all appellants (who  include not  only PR-DOJ  but\r\nalso  the Commonwealth  of Puerto  Rico  and divers  officers and\r\nagents of the Commonwealth).\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nPR-DOJ  moved for reconsideration, Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e), but the\r\n\ncourt, by order dated February 5, 1996, refused to budge.  PR-DOJ\r\n\nnow appeals.  We summarily affirm.\r\n\n          The  district court has  written two  orders explaining\r\n\nits reasoning,  and we see scant  need to wax longiloquent.
