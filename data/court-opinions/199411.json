Puerto Rico's central government\n\noperates under a civil service system premised on the merit\n\nprinciple.     See 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1311.               Career positions\n\nordinarily are filled according to a set protocol.              Id. § 1333.\n\nThe system, however, permits temporary appointments, commonly\n\ncalled transitory appointments, to career positions in specified\n\ncircumstances.        See id. § 1333(12)(a)-(f).\n\n            On June 16, 1995, hierarchs at the State Insurance Fund\n\n(the SIF), responding to a vacancy unexpectedly created by an\n\ninjury to a career employee, granted Javier Vélez Irizarry\n\n(Vélez) a transitory appointment as Administrative Official I\n\n(AO) at the SIF's Utuado office.              At that time, plaintiff-\n\nappellant Héctor Negrón Torres (Negrón) held a lesser position,\n\nOficial     Pagador    Auxiliar   I,    in   the   same   office.    It   is\n\nundisputed that the AO position is a career position which does\n\nnot involve policymaking.\n\n            On August 19, 1996, the SIF published a hiring call for\n\nthe AO position at Utuado.        The appellant seasonably applied for\n\nthe post.    After the application period closed, the SIF promptly\n\nissued a certificate of eligible candidates.              See   3 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. § 1333 (outlining general provisions governing recruitment\n\nand selection of career personnel); SIF Pers. Reg. § 9.8(1)\n\n(describing procedures for certifying and selecting candidates).\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fThe appellant was fifth on the list, but Vélez (who also had\n\napplied) did not make the cut.            The matter languished until May\n\n30,   1998,   when    the    SIF    conferred      career    status     on   Vélez,\n\nretroactive to January 1, 1998.\n\n          Invoking 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the appellant sued the SIF\n\nand two of its high-ranking officials:                Oscar Ramos, the chief\n\nadministrator, and Ada Guzmán, the human resources director.                     He\n\ndid not challenge Vélez's original appointment as a transitory\n\nemployee, but, rather, claimed that the defendants had deprived\n\nhim of a career appointment to the AO position on the basis of\n\nhis political affiliation (the appellant is a member of the\n\nPopular   Democratic        Party    whereas      Vélez    and    the   individual\n\ndefendants     are    alleged       to   be     members    of    the    rival   New\n\nProgressive Party).         The defendants denied liability and in due\n\ncourse moved for summary judgment.                See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\nAfter extensive briefing, the district court granted the motion.\n\nNegrón Torres v. SIF, Civ. No. 98-2013 (D.P.R. May 9, 2000)\n\n(unpublished).       This appeal ensued.\n\n          We     have       frequently         preached,    but     perhaps     too\n\ninfrequently practiced, the philosophy that \"when a lower court\n\nproduces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an appellate\n\ncourt should refrain from writing at length to no other end than\n\nto hear its own words resonate.\"                  Lawton v. State Mut. Life\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fAssur. Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996).                            This case fits\n\nthe Lawton model.            Consequently, we resist the temptation to\n\nrepastinate ground that is already well-ploughed and affirm\n\nsubstantially on the basis of the lower court's thoughtful\n\nopinion.      We add only two relatively brief sets of comments.\n\n              First:      Vélez's          permanent       appointment      was   not    an\n\nisolated      event.         As      the      district         court   explained,       the\n\nlegislature         enacted,      and    the    governor         signed    into   law    on\n\nDecember      28,    1995,     Act      No.    256    —    a   statute     that   granted\n\npermanent career status to hundreds of transitory employees then\n\nworking for the central government.                       The SIF, though an arm of\n\nthe government, is organized as a separate corporation, and its\n\nemployees therefore were excluded from the benefits of Act No.\n\n256.       The evidence is uncontradicted that, in order to remedy\n\nthis perceived inequity, the SIF immediately began to explore\n\nthe possibility of granting career status to its own transitory\n\nemployees.1      The groundwork for this effort was laid well before\n\nthe SIF published the call for the AO position at Utuado, and\n\nthe effort continued unabated after the position was posted.\n\nProgress was understandably slow:                     Guzmán first had to obtain a\n\n\n       1\n      More precisely put, the SIF                   aspired to grant career status\nto those transitory employees who                   met Act No. 256's requirements\nas to length of service and the                     like. The appellant does not\ndispute that, as of the relevant                    date (January 1, 1998), Vélez\nmet these requirements.\n\n                                              -5-\n\fgreen light from the Director of Labor Relations, and then\n\nbargain with several unions.                  It was not until October 26, 1996,\n\nthat the SIF and the unions were able to stipulate to converting\n\n265 transitory employees into career employees.                        It took another\n\nyear       to     work    out    the    arrangements       with       an    association\n\nrepresenting             managerial      employees       to     convert        forty-six\n\nadditional transitory employees (including Vélez) to career\n\nstatus.2\n\n                 The     appellant     has     not   adduced     any       significantly\n\nprobative         evidence      to     show    either    that     this       agency-wide\n\npersonnel reclassification was a sham or that the AO position\n\nwas improperly included in the conversion.                            Absent any such\n\nshowing, the district court did not err in granting                                 brevis\n\ndisposition in the defendants' favor.                     Cf. Ruiz v. Posadas de\n\nSan    Juan       Assocs.,      124    F.3d     243,    247-48    (1st       Cir.    1997)\n\n(explaining that in order to make out a case of discrimination\n\nin    the       context    of   changes      made    pursuant    to    a    company-wide\n\npersonnel policy, the plaintiff must show that the policy itself\n\nwas either a sham or discriminatorily applied to her).\n\n\n\n       2\n     The appellant makes much of the fact that the AO\nappointment process stalled for upwards of a year and a half.\nHe offered no evidence, however, of the time typically taken to\nfill such positions. Moreover, he offered no evidence that the\nSIF, during the same period, consummated permanent appointments\nto other career positions occupied by transitory employees.\n\n                                              -6-\n\f            Second: The appellant hinges virtually his entire case\n\non the contrast between his party affiliation and Vélez's.                   The\n\nlaw   is   crystal    clear,   however,      that    proving   a   causal   link\n\nbetween a challenged personnel action and an asserted political\n\nanimus     requires    more    than     merely      juxtaposing    a   person's\n\npolitical affiliation with the fact that he arguably was treated\n\nunfairly.     See Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d\n\n49, 58 (1st Cir. 1990).        By the same token, the fact that those\n\ncharged with making personnel decisions are affiliated with a\n\npolitical    party    different       than   an   unsuccessful     aspirant's,\n\nwithout more, will not suffice to show political discrimination\n\nand thereby forestall summary judgment.                See, e.g., Figueroa-\n\nSerrano v.     Ramos-Alverio, 221 F.3d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2000);\n\nKauffman v. P.R. Tel. Co., 841 F.2d 1169, 1172 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n            The charge of political discrimination is particularly\n\nincongruous here.       While the appellant claims to be an active\n\nmember of the Popular Democratic Party, there is not a shred of\n\nevidence that either of the decisionmakers — Ramos or Guzmán —\n\nknew as much.    Thus, the claim that they discriminated against\n\nthe appellant because of his party membership cannot survive\n\nscrutiny.    See López-Carrasquillo v. Rubianes, 230 F.3d 409, 414\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (noting that speculative assertions regarding\n\npolitical discrimination are not enough to withstand a Rule 56\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fmotion); Rivera-Cotto v. Rivera, 38 F.3d 611, 613-14 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (similar).\n\n            We need go no further. 3    While we can empathize with\n\nthe frustrations of a civil servant who earns a place on a list\n\nof eligibles for a better job only to have the competition\n\naborted by an across-the-board reclassification, there is no\n\nprincipled way to say, on this record, that political animus\n\nplayed a part.     Hence, for the reasons stated in the district\n\ncourt's   meticulous   opinion,   as    augmented   by   our   decurtate\n\ncomments, we affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    3We note that the appellant, who was merely one of several\nindividuals on the eligibles' list, has a decidedly tenuous\nclaim to the AO position. Because the case is easily resolved\non other grounds, however, we do not pursue this apparent\nweakness.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f",

Absent any such\n\nshowing, the district court did not err in granting                                 brevis\n\ndisposition in the defendants' favor.                     Cf. Ruiz v.

Moreover, he offered no evidence that the\nSIF, during the same period, consummated permanent appointments\nto other career positions occupied by transitory employees.\n\n                                              -6-\n\f            Second: The appellant hinges virtually his entire case\n\non the contrast between his party affiliation and Vélez's.                   The\n\nlaw   is   crystal    clear,   however,      that    proving   a   causal   link\n\nbetween a challenged personnel action and an asserted political\n\nanimus     requires    more    than     merely      juxtaposing    a   person's\n\npolitical affiliation with the fact that he arguably was treated\n\nunfairly.     See Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (1st Cir. 1990).        By the same token, the fact that those\n\ncharged with making personnel decisions are affiliated with a\n\npolitical    party    different       than   an   unsuccessful     aspirant's,\n\nwithout more, will not suffice to show political discrimination\n\nand thereby forestall summary judgment.                See, e.g., Figueroa-\n\nSerrano v.     Ramos-Alverio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199013\"><a href=\"/opinion/199013/figueroa-serrano-v-ramos-alverio/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2000);\n\nKauffman v.

While the appellant claims to be an active\n\nmember of the Popular Democratic Party, there is not a shred of\n\nevidence that either of the decisionmakers — Ramos or Guzmán —\n\nknew as much.    Thus, the claim that they discriminated against\n\nthe appellant because of his party membership cannot survive\n\nscrutiny.    See López-Carrasquillo v. Rubianes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199133\"><a href=\"/opinion/199133/lopez-carrasquillo-v-rubianes/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 414\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (noting that speculative assertions regarding\n\npolitical discrimination are not enough to withstand a Rule 56\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fmotion); Rivera-Cotto v.

Hence, for the reasons stated in the district\n\ncourt's   meticulous   opinion,   as    augmented   by   our   decurtate\n\ncomments, we affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n    3We note that the appellant, who was merely one of several\nindividuals on the eligibles' list, has a decidedly tenuous\nclaim to the AO position.
