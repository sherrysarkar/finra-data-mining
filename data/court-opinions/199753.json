CRANE,\n\n                       Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n              [Hon. Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Torruella, Selya and Lynch,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Susan S. Crane on brief pro se.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\nMcGaughey, Appellate Chief, on brief for appellee.\n\f                          December 27, 2001\n\n          Per Curiam. Pro se defendant Susan Crane appeals\n\na   district    court    judgment      that    revoked      her   supervised\n\nrelease   and    sentenced       her    to     an   additional       term   of\n\nimprisonment.     Having thoroughly reviewed the record and the\n\nparties' briefs on appeal, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not clearly err in finding that Crane violated the\n\nthree conditions of her supervised release.                   Further, the\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion by revoking Crane's\n\nsupervised     release    term    and     imposing     another       term    of\n\nimprisonment.       The    arguments         that   Crane    makes    to    the\n\ncontrary are either waived because she did not raise them\n\nbelow or patently meritless.              See, e.g., United States v.\n\nMaxwell, 254 F.3d 21, 25-30 (1 st Cir. 2001).                 Accordingly,\n\nthe judgment of the district court is affirmed.
