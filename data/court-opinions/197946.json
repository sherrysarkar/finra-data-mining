STAHL, Circuit Judge.  Plaintiff-appellant Seacoast\r\nMotors of Salisbury, Inc. (\"Seacoast\") appeals from a district\r\ncourt order dismissing its complaint and compelling arbitration. \r\nWe hold that we lack jurisdiction to review the propriety of the\r\ndistrict court's non-final, \"embedded\" order compelling\r\narbitration. \r\n       I.  FACTS AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS\r\nOn October 21, 1991, Seacoast, an automobile dealership,\r\nand Chrysler Corporation (\"Chrysler\") entered into five agreements\r\nauthorizing Seacoast to sell and service new Chrysler motor\r\nvehicles in Salisbury, Massachusetts.  By the terms of the\r\nagreements, all disputes had to be submitted to arbitration.       On\r\nFebruary 6, 1996, Chrysler notified Seacoast that it intended to\r\nestablish a new Chrysler dealership in nearby Haverhill,\r\nMassachusetts.  In response, on August 9, 1996, Seacoast filed a\r\ncomplaint in the Essex County Superior Court alleging that, by\r\nseeking to establish a dealership in Seacoast's market area,\r\nChrysler had engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices in\r\nviolation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93B.  Seacoast sought to enjoin\r\nestablishment of the new franchise and to recover damages, fees,\r\nand costs.  \r\n          On August 22, 1996, Chrysler removed the case to federal\r\ncourt based on diversity jurisdiction.  Shortly thereafter, relying\r\non sections 3 and 4 of the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), 9\r\nU.S.C.  1-16, Chrysler moved for \"an order dismissing or,\r\nalternatively, staying the action and compelling the plaintiff\r\n. . . to proceed with arbitration.\"  Seacoast opposed the motion on\r\nthe ground that arbitration in this case would contravene public\r\npolicy.  Pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the case was\r\ntransferred to a magistrate judge, who, on April 22, 1997,\r\ndismissed the case with costs and compelled arbitration.  Seacoast\r\nnow appeals the dismissal.\r\n                       II.  DISCUSSION\r\n          Seacoast urges us to review the propriety of the lower\r\ncourt's order, which both dismissed the action and compelled\r\narbitration.  The question that we must address initially is\r\nwhether appellate jurisdiction attaches to the court's order\r\ncompelling arbitration.  We conclude that the order was\r\ninterlocutory, and that we therefore lack jurisdiction to review\r\nit.\r\n          Section 3 of the FAA provides that, when an action\r\nimplicates an issue covered by an arbitration agreement between the\r\nparties, the district court, at the request of any party, \"shall\r\n. . . stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been\r\nhad in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\"  9 U.S.C.  3. \r\nSection 4 provides that any party to an arbitration agreement may\r\npetition the district court for an order compelling arbitration,\r\nirrespective of any ongoing proceeding.  See id.  4.  Appellate\r\nreview of orders that favor arbitration -- that is, orders that\r\nstay an action pending arbitration pursuant to section 3 or compel\r\narbitration under section 4 -- is proscribed, if those orders are\r\n\"interlocutory.\"  See id.  16(b)(1) &amp; (2).  Under section\r\n16(a)(3), however, an appellate court may review the merits of\r\norders that favor arbitration, if those orders are \"final\r\ndecision[s].\"  Id.  16(a)(3).  Thus, whether a particular order\r\nfavoring arbitration is appealable depends on whether it is final\r\nor interlocutory.\r\n          The general rule governing what constitutes a final\r\ndecision under section 16 is that an order compelling arbitration\r\nis not final, and therefore not immediately reviewable, if the\r\narbitrability issue is \"embedded\" -- that is, \"if issues other than\r\nthe propriety of arbitration are raised or relief other than a\r\ndetermination as to the arbitrability of the dispute is sought.\" \r\nAdair, 25 F.3d at 955.  By contrast, an order qualifies as a final\r\norder within the meaning of section 16 if the action is\r\n\"independent,\" or brought solely for the purpose of obtaining such\r\nan order.  See Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Lai, 42 F.3d 1299,\r\n1302 (9th Cir. 1994); Humphrey v. Prudential Secs., Inc., 4 F.3d\r\n313, 317 (4th Cir. 1993); S+L+H S.p.A. v. Miller-St. Nazianz, Inc.,\r\n988 F.2d 1518, 1522 (7th Cir. 1993); Filanto, S.P.A. v. Chilewich\r\nInt'l Corp., 984 F.2d 58, 60 (2d Cir. 1993).  We follow this rule\r\nof appealability, which is based on finality principles that were\r\nfirmly established at the time of section 16's enactment in 1988. \r\nSee Stedor Enters., Ltd. v. Armtex, Inc., 947 F.2d 727, 729-32 (4th\r\nCir. 1991).  \r\n          Chrysler's request for arbitration is embedded because\r\nthe issue of arbitrability arises here in the context of a claim\r\nfor relief (brought by Seacoast) that goes beyond a determination\r\nof the arbitrability of the dispute.  It does not matter that all\r\nof the substantive claims in the suit -- the \"other relief sought\"\r\n-- are would-be subjects of the arbitration.  See Gammaro v. Thorp\r\nConsumer Discount Co., 15 F.3d 93, 96 (8th Cir. 1994) (holding\r\nthat, even when the pending suit is limited to arbitrable claims,\r\nthe order compelling arbitration is embedded); Humphrey, 4 F.3d at\r\n318 (same).  \r\n          However, that arbitrability was an embedded issue does\r\nnot by itself answer the jurisdictional question.  In most embedded\r\nproceedings in which the district court's decision favors\r\narbitration, the district court, pursuant to section 3, stays the\r\naction pending arbitration.  Here, by contrast, although the\r\ndistrict court granted Chrysler's motion to compel arbitration, it\r\nentered an order dismissing, rather than staying, the proceedings. \r\nWe must address, then, whether a dismissal without prejudice in\r\ndeference to arbitration in the context of an embedded proceeding\r\nis an appealable (that is, final) decision.  \r\n          This circuit has not addressed this question before, and\r\nother circuits have been divided on the issue.  As the Seventh\r\nCircuit outlined recently in Napleton v. General Motors Corp., 1998\r\nWL 117893,    F.3d   ,    (7th Cir. 1998), some circuits have\r\ndetermined that an order of dismissal accompanying an order\r\nfavoring arbitration is appealable as a final decision, even if the\r\nproceeding is embedded, see Armijo v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.,\r\n72 F.3d 793, 797 (10th Cir. 1995) (finding jurisdiction when, in an\r\nembedded proceeding, the district court had ordered arbitration and\r\ndismissed action, on the basis that the moving party had requested\r\nthat the action be dismissed, not stayed, pending arbitration);\r\nNationwide Ins. Co. of Columbus, Ohio v. Patterson, 953 F.2d 44, 46\r\n(3d Cir. 1991) (finding jurisdiction to review an arbitration order\r\non the basis that \"the district court's dismissal of [the] action\r\nplainly signifies that th[e] arbitration is not a part of any\r\nongoing proceeding\"); see also Arnold v. Arnold Corp., 920 F.2d\r\n1269, 1276 (6th Cir. 1990) (discerning in the FAA's legislative\r\nhistory an intention to abrogate the distinction between embedded\r\nand independent proceedings and to \"allow[] appeals from final\r\ndecisions affecting arbitration whether or not they direct or\r\nrefuse to direct arbitration,\" and, correspondingly, finding\r\njurisdiction to review an arbitration order in which the\r\nproceedings had been dismissed), while other circuits have focused\r\non the distinction between embedded and independent proceedings to\r\ndetermine whether jurisdiction exists over an appeal from a\r\ndismissal of an order favoring arbitration, see McCarthy v.\r\nProvidential Corp., 122 F.3d 1242, 1244 (9th Cir. 1997); In re\r\nPisgah Contractors, Inc., 117 F.3d 133, 136 (4th Cir. 1997); Altman\r\nNursing, Inc. v. Clay Capital Corp., 84 F.3d 769, 771 (5th Cir.\r\n1996); Gammaro, 15 F.3d at 96.  \r\n          The Napleton panel followed the latter approach,\r\nconcluding that \"it is the nature of the underlying action, not the\r\nstyle of the district court's decision requiring arbitration, that\r\ndetermines whether we have jurisdiction over appeals from decisions\r\ngranting arbitration.\"  1998 WL 117893, at *4,    F.3d at   .  We\r\ndo likewise and hold that we lack jurisdiction under the FAA to\r\nreview whether the court's order compelling arbitration was proper. \r\nSuch a result avoids elevating form over substance and promotes\r\nboth the pro-arbitration purposes of the FAA and the institutional\r\ngoal of avoiding piecemeal appeals and systemic delays.  See id. at\r\n*4-*6,    F.3d at   .  \r\n          Accordingly, Seacoast's appeal is dismissed for want of\r\nappellate jurisdiction.\r\n\n          Costs to appellee.\n",

DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seacoast urges us to review the propriety of the lower court's order, which both dismissed the action and compelled arbitration.  The question that we must address initially is whether appellate jurisdiction attaches to the court's order compelling arbitration.  We conclude that the order was interlocutory, and that we therefore lack jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3 of the FAA provides that, when an action implicates an issue covered by an arbitration agreement between the parties, the district court, at the request of any party, \"shall ... stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.\"  9 U.S.C. &#167; 3.  Section 4 provides that any party to an arbitration agreement may petition the district court for an order compelling arbitration, irrespective of any ongoing proceeding.  See id. &#167; 4.  Appellate review of orders that favor arbitration--that is, orders that stay an action pending arbitration pursuant to section 3 or compel arbitration under section 4--is proscribed, if those orders are \"interlocutory.\"   See id. &#167; 16(b)(1) &amp; (2).  Under section 16(a)(3), however, an appellate court may review the merits of orders that favor arbitration, if those orders are \"final decision[s].\"  Id. &#167; 16(a)(3).  Thus, whether a particular order favoring arbitration is appealable depends on whether it is final or interlocutory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general rule governing what constitutes a final decision under section 16 is that an order compelling arbitration is not final, and therefore not immediately reviewable, if the arbitrability issue is \"embedded\"--that is, \"if issues other than the propriety of arbitration are raised or relief other than a determination as to the arbitrability of the dispute is sought.\"  Adair, 25 F.3d at 955.   By contrast, an order qualifies as a final order within the meaning of section 16 if the action is \"independent,\" or brought solely for the purpose of obtaining such an order.  See Prudential Ins.

We follow this rule of appealability, which is based on finality principles that were firmly established at the time of section 16's enactment in 1988.  See Stedor Enters., Ltd. v. Armtex, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570502\"><a href=\"/opinion/570502/stedor-enterprises-limited-v-armtex-incorporated/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span>, 729-32 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chrysler's request for arbitration is embedded because the issue of arbitrability arises here in the context of a claim for relief (brought by Seacoast) that goes beyond a determination of the arbitrability of the dispute.  It does not matter that all of the substantive claims in the suit--the \"other relief sought\"--are would-be subjects of the arbitration.  See Gammaro v. Thorp Consumer Discount Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"661572\"><a href=\"/opinion/661572/joseph-j-gammaro-v-thorp-consumer-discount-company-doing-business-as-itt/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 96 (8th Cir.1994) (holding that, even when the pending suit is limited to arbitrable claims, the order compelling arbitration is embedded);  Humphrey, 4 F.3d at 318 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, that arbitrability was an embedded issue does not by itself answer the jurisdictional question.  In most embedded proceedings in which the district court's decision favors arbitration, the district court, pursuant to section 3, stays the action pending arbitration.  Here, by contrast, although the district court granted Chrysler's motion to compel arbitration, it entered an order dismissing, rather than staying, the proceedings.  We must address, then, whether a dismissal without prejudice in deference to arbitration in the context of an embedded proceeding is an appealable (that is, final) decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has not addressed this question before, and other circuits have been divided on the issue.  As the Seventh Circuit outlined recently in Napleton v. General Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752373\"><a href=\"/opinion/752373/katherine-r-napleton-not-individually-but-as-trustee-under-the-katherine/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span> (7th Cir.1998), some circuits have determined that an order of dismissal accompanying an order favoring arbitration is appealable as a final decision, even if the proceeding is embedded, see Armijo v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710105\"><a href=\"/opinion/710105/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1544-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43870-jake-armijo/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span>, 797 (10th Cir.1995) (finding jurisdiction when, in an embedded proceeding, the district court had ordered arbitration and dismissed action, on the basis that the moving party had requested that the action be dismissed, not stayed, pending arbitration);  Nationwide Ins.

Providential Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745285\"><a href=\"/opinion/745285/97-cal-daily-op-serv-6619-97-daily-journal-dar-10786-mary-mccarthy/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1242</span></a></span>, 1244 (9th Cir.1997);  In re Pisgah Contractors, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743017\"><a href=\"/opinion/743017/in-re-pisgah-contractors-incorporated-debtor-pisgah-contractors/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 136 (4th Cir.1997);  Altman Nursing, Inc. v.

We do likewise and hold that we lack jurisdiction under the FAA to review whether the court's order compelling arbitration was proper.  Such a result avoids elevating form over substance and promotes both the pro-arbitration purposes of the FAA and the institutional goal of avoiding piecemeal appeals and systemic delays.
