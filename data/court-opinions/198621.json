After carefully reviewing the briefs and\r\nrecord on appeal, we affirm substantially for the reasons\r\nstated by the district court.  This action was filed on April\r\n21, 1998.  Appellant described no specific incident of a civil-\r\nrights violation which occurred within the preceding three-year\r\nperiod.  While we recognize that the appellant alleged that his\r\nwife was cited for a traffic violation within the limitations\r\nperiod, 42 U.S.C.  1983 does not provide a remedy for every\r\ntype of alleged wrong.  See Whren v. United States, 517 U.S.\r\n806, 809-810 (1996); Judge v. Lowell, 160 F.3d 67, 76 n.15 (1st\r\nCir. 1998); Earle v. Benoit, 850 F.2d 836, 844 (1st Cir. 1988).\r\n          Affirmed.  Loc.
