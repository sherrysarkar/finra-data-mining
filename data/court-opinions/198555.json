Ernest C. Torres, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Ramiro Ramirez on brief pro se.\r\n   Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, and Kenneth P.\r\nMadden, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 12, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed\r\ndefendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.  We\r\nreach this conclusion essentially for the reasons stated by the\r\ndistrict court in its Memorandum and Order dated August 20,\r\n1998, and we add only this comment.  \r\n          We are not prepared to say in the circumstances of\r\nthis case that the attorney's alleged failure to obtain\r\npetitioner's consent, would have been presumptively\r\nprejudicial.  See Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 11-15 (1st Cir.\r\n1994); Underwood v. Clark, 939 F.2d 473, 474 (7th Cir. 1991);\r\nsee also  United States v. Gomes,     F.3d    , slip op. at 17\r\n(1st Cir. No. 97-2193  May 27, 1999); Bell v. Evatt, 72 F.3d\r\n421, 429 (4th Cir. 1995).  We reject petitioner's analogies to\r\na guilty plea or a waiver of jury trial, see Gomes,     F.3d\r\n   , slip op. at 17, and his conclusory allegations of breach\r\nof loyalty and actual conflict of interest have no basis.\r\n          Affirmed.
