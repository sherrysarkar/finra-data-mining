Background\r                                    I.  Background\r\n\n          The  case before us  arose from the  termination of the\r\n\nshort-term  disability  benefits   of  the   Plaintiff-Appellant,\r\n\nRosemary  Petralia,  by  the  Defendants-Appellees,  AT&amp;T  Global\r\n\nInformation Solutions  Company  (\"AT&amp;T\"), and  The  Employee  and\r\n\nGroup Benefit Plan for Account Managers and Sales Representatives\r\n\nfor the Systemedia Division (\"the plan\").\r\n\n          Plaintiff-Appellant sought review of the termination in\r\n\nthe district court.  The district court granted summary judgment,\r\n\nin  part, in favor of Petralia.  Specifically, the district court\r\n\nfound  that the termination  notice Defendants-Appellees provided\r\n\nto  Petralia did  not comply  with requirements  of the  Employee\r\n\nRetirement  and  Income  Security  Act, 29  U.S.C.      1001-1461\r\n\n(\"ERISA\").  The notice failed to inform Petralia of her  right to\r\n\nappeal  the  termination, and  it failed  to  inform her  of what\r\n\nadditional information  she could  provide to  avoid termination.\r\n\nThe district  court  determined that  the proper  remedy for  the\r\n\nERISA violations  was to remand the issue of Petralia's continued\r\n\neligibility for short-term benefits to the plan fiduciary.  \r\n\n          The district court granted summary judgment in favor of\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nDefendants-Appellees  on  the   issue  of  long-term   disability\r\n\nbenefits.  Since eligibility for long-term benefits is contingent\r\n\nupon  exhaustion  of  short-term  benefits, and  the  Defendants-\r\n\nAppellees   terminated   the   Plaintiff-Appellant's   short-term\r\n\nbenefits before  she exhausted them,  the Plaintiff-Appellant has\r\n\nnot applied  for, and  the Defendants-Appellees have  not denied,\r\n\nlong-term benefits.  Plaintiff-Appellant requests that this court\r\n\nvacate  the remand  order  of the  district  court, and  use  its\r\n\nequitable  powers   to  reinstate  the  Appellant   to  the  plan\r\n\nretroactively and  to award past and  future long-term disability\r\n\nbenefits to the Appellant.\r\n\n                   II.  Appellate Jurisdiction\r                             II.  Appellate Jurisdiction\r\n\n          Before we inquire into the merits of a dispute, we must\r\n\naddress  the  question of  appellate  jurisdiction.   Doughty  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nUnderwriters at Lloyd's, London  (In re Wallis), 6 F.3d  856, 860\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st  Cir.  1993).     There  is  a  \"bedrock   requirement  that\r\n\njurisdiction  can never be assumed  but must be  premised on some\r\n\naffirmative source.\"  Id.  \r                                   \r\n\n          Generally, appellate jurisdiction is limited  to review\r\n\nof final decisions of the district courts.  28 U.S.C.   1291; see\r                                                                           \r\n\nMassachusetts v. V &amp;  M Management, Inc., 929 F.2d 830,  833 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1991)(per curiam).\r\n\n          A  \"collateral order\"  may  be immediately  appealable,\r\n\nhowever, if it has certain prescribed  characteristics.  Cohen v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBeneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546 (1949) (immediate\r                                      \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nappeal is proper if  the decision of the district  court \"appears\r\n\nto fall in  that small  class which finally  determine claims  of\r\n\nright  separable from, and collateral to,  rights asserted in the\r\n\naction,  too important to be denied review and too independent of\r\n\nthe  cause  itself to  require  that  appellate consideration  be\r\n\ndeferred until the whole case is adjudicated\").  \r\n\n          \"[A]n order or judgment  is usually considered  'final'\r\n\n(hence, appealable)  only when it resolves  the contested matter,\r\n\nleaving nothing  to be done except execution  of the judgment.  A\r\n\ncorollary  rule is  that  an  order  remanding  a  matter  to  an\r\n\nadministrative agency for further findings and proceedings is not\r\n\nfinal.\"    Director,  Office  of Workers'  Compensation Programs,\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited  States Dep't of Labor v. Bath  Iron Works Corp., 853 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n11,  13  (1st  Cir.  1988)(quotations,  citations,  and  footnote\r\n\nomitted).  \r\n\n          We  think  this corollary  rule  applies  to the  order\r\n\nremanding this  case  to the  plan  administrators.   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nShannon v.  Jack Eckerd Corp., 55 F.3d 561, 563 (11th Cir. 1995).\r                                       \r\n\nThe  district  court  sent the  present  case  back  to the  plan\r\n\nadministrators to determine \"the issue of [Appellant's] continued\r\n\neligibility for  short-term benefits.\"   Petralia v.  AT&amp;T Global\r                                                                           \r\n\nInfo.  Solutions Co., No. 94-533-M  (D.N.H. July 29, 1996) (order\r                              \r\n\nremanding  case  to plan  administrators).    The district  court\r\n\nstated in its  order:   \"[The plan] shall  afford Ms. Petralia  a\r\n\nfull  opportunity  under  the   plan's  terms  to  establish  her\r\n\ncontinued  eligibility for short-term benefits, as of the time of\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nimproper termination, which of  course will require an assessment\r\n\nof whatever evidence she might present to establish her continued\r\n\neligibility.\"  Id.  Rather than \"leaving nothing to be done,\" the\r                            \r\n\ndistrict  court  required  further  proceedings  and findings  on\r                                   \r\n\nremand.  Applying the standard cited above to the remand order in\r\n\nthis case,  we conclude that  the order is not  a final judgment.\r\n\nTherefore,   28   U.S.C.     1291  does   not   confer  appellate\r\n\njurisdiction over this case.\r\n\n          The \"collateral order\" doctrine  developed in Cohen and\r                                                                       \r\n\nlater decisions does not apply in the circumstances of this case.\r\n\nThat  doctrine is, in essence, \"a 'narrow exception to the normal\r\n\napplication of the final judgment rule,'\" prescribed in 28 U.S.C.\r\n\n  1291.  Doughty, 6 F.3d at 862 (quoting Midland Asphalt Corp. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States, 489 U.S.  794, 798 (1989)).  The  collateral order\r                       \r\n\ndoctrine is  \"limited to  orders that (1)  conclusively determine\r\n\n(2) important  legal questions which are  (3) completely separate\r\n\nfrom  the merits of the underlying action and are (4) effectively\r\n\nunreviewable on appeal from  a final judgment.\"  Doughty,  6 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat 862.  \r\n\n          The  issue remanded  to the  plan in  this case  is not\r                                                                           \r\n\ncollateral;  Petralia's continued  eligibility for  benefits, the\r\n\nissue  remanded  to the  plan, is  the very  heart of  this case.\r\n\nConsequently, the issue is  effectively reviewable on appeal from\r\n\na  final judgment,  and  the rationale  of  the collateral  order\r\n\ndoctrine  does not apply  to this case.   Moreover, the issue has\r\n\nnot  been conclusively determined below, as required by the first\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nprong  of the collateral order  doctrine.  \"[T]o  come within the\r\n\ncollateral  order rule,  a decree  must definitively  resolve the\r\n\nmerits of the collateral issue, not merely determine  which court\r\n\nwill  thereafter resolve it.\"  Id. at  863.  Because the order of\r                                            \r\n\nthe  district  court  did  not  conclusively  determine  a  legal\r\n\nquestion separate from the  merits of the underlying action,  and\r\n\nthe  issue remains  subject  to review  on  appeal from  a  final\r\n\njudgment,  we conclude that the collateral order exception to the\r\n\nfinal judgment rule does not apply to this case.\r\n\n             III.  Mandamus or Other Prerogative Writ\r                       III.  Mandamus or Other Prerogative Writ\r\n\n          The  initial briefs  of  the parties  having failed  to\r\n\naddress the issue of appellate jurisdiction, the Panel questioned\r\n\ncounsel about jurisdiction and allowed the filing of Supplemental\r\n\nBriefs.   Appellees acknowledged lack of  appellate jurisdiction.\r\n\nIn her Supplemental Brief, Appellant argues  that in Gillespie v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States  Steel  Corp.,  379  U.S.  148  (1964),  the  Court\r                                     \r\n\nrecognized  \"what might  well be  called the  'twilight zone'  of\r\n\nfinality,\" id.  at 152, and asks  us to take jurisdiction  on the\r                        \r\n\nground   that  otherwise   Rosemary  Petralia  may   be  \"forever\r\n\nforeclosed\" from appellate review of \"the proof of her [claim of]\r\n\nchronic    fatigue    syndrome.\"       Supplemental    Brief   of\r\n\nPlaintiff/Appellant  at   4.    Although  this   request  in  the\r\n\nSupplemental  Brief  was not  in the  form  of a  petition  for a\r\n\nprerogative writ, in the  interests of assurance of  fair process\r\n\nwe address the request as if it were so designated.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          A writ of mandamus \"must be used stintingly and brought\r\n\nto bear only in extraordinary situations.\" Doughty, supra, 6 F.3d\r                                                                   \r\n\nat  865.   To show  grounds for  such extraordinary  relief here,\r\n\nRosemary  Petralia  would be  required  to  demonstrate that  the\r\n\nremand  order was palpably erroneous and that she faces a special\r                                                  \r\n\nrisk  of irreparable harm.  Id.  Plaintiff-Appellant has not made\r                                         \r\n\nthis showing since, as noted above, issues regarding her proof of\r\n\nher  claim   of  chronic  fatigue  syndrome   remain  effectively\r\n\nreviewable  on appeal from a final judgment, after one is ordered\r\n\nand entered.  See id. at 866.\r                               \r\n\n       IV.  Retention of Jurisdiction in the District Court\r                 IV.  Retention of Jurisdiction in the District Court\r\n\n          Ordinarily  implicit  in a  district  court's order  of\r\n\nremand to a plan fiduciary  is an understanding that after a  new\r\n\ndecision by the plan  fiduciary, a party seeking judicial  review\r\n\nin  the district court may do so by  a timely motion filed in the\r\n\nsame civil  action, and is  not required to commence  a new civil\r\n\naction.    To avoid  any  misunderstanding  that might  otherwise\r\n\noccur, we state that we interpret the order of the district court\r\n\nin this case as  having retained jurisdiction, in this  sense, to\r\n\nhear and decide any timely motion for judicial review filed after\r\n\nfurther proceedings  before  the  plan fiduciary.    This  is  so\r\n\nregardless of whether the  case is formally held open  or instead\r\n\nadministratively  closed  on the  district  court  docket in  the\r\n\nmeantime.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n                          V.  Conclusion\r                                    V.  Conclusion\r\n\n          Having determined that the remand order of the district\r\n\ncourt is not a final judgment, that the collateral order doctrine\r\n\ndoes not apply to the decision of the district court remanding an\r\n\nissue to the plan administrators, and, that a prerogative writ is\r\n\nnot warranted, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  \r\n\n          So ordered.  Costs are awarded to Appellees.\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n",

Specifically, the district court found that the termination notice Defendants-Appellees provided to Petralia did not comply with requirements of the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1001-1461 (\"ERISA\").  The notice failed to inform Petralia of her right to appeal the termination, and it failed to inform her of what additional information she could provide to avoid termination.  The district court determined that the proper remedy for the ERISA violations was to remand the issue of Petralia's continued eligibility for short-term benefits to the plan fiduciary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees on the issue of long-term disability benefits.  Since eligibility for long-term benefits is contingent upon exhaustion of short-term benefits, and the Defendants-Appellees terminated the Plaintiff-Appellant's short-term benefits before she exhausted them, the Plaintiff-Appellant has not applied for, and the Defendants-Appellees have not denied, long-term benefits.  Plaintiff-Appellant requests that this court vacate the remand order of the district court, and use its equitable powers to reinstate the Appellant to the plan retroactively and to award past and future long-term disability benefits to the Appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before we inquire into the merits of a dispute, we must address the question of appellate jurisdiction.  Doughty v. Underwriters at Lloyd's, London (In re Wallis), 6 F.3d 856, 860 (1st Cir.1993).  There is a \"bedrock requirement that jurisdiction can never be assumed but must be premised on some affirmative source.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, appellate jurisdiction is limited to review of final decisions of the district courts.  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291;  see Massachusetts v. V &amp; M Management, Inc., 929 F.2d 830, 833 (1st Cir.1991)(per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"collateral order\" may be immediately appealable, however, if it has certain prescribed characteristics.  Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 546, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949) (immediate appeal is proper if the decision of the district court \"appears to fall in that small class which finally determine claims of right separable from, and collateral to, rights asserted in the action, too important to be denied review and too independent of the cause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case is adjudicated\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A]n order or judgment is usually considered 'final' (hence, appealable) only when it resolves the contested matter, leaving nothing to be done except execution of the judgment.  A corollary rule is that an order remanding a matter to an administrative agency for further findings and proceedings is not final.\"  Director, Office of Workers' Compensation Programs, United States Dep't of Labor v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 853 F.2d 11, 13 (1st Cir.1988)(quotations, citations, and footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think this corollary rule applies to the order remanding this case to the plan administrators.  See, e.g., Shannon v. Jack Eckerd Corp., 55 F.3d 561, 563 (11th Cir.1995).  The district court sent the present case back to the plan administrators to determine \"the issue of [Appellant's] continued eligibility for short-term benefits.\"  Petralia v. AT&amp;T Global Info.  Solutions Co., No. 94-533-M (D.N.H. July 29, 1996) (order remanding case to plan administrators).  The district court stated in its order:  \"[The plan] shall afford Ms. Petralia a full opportunity under the plan's terms to establish her continued eligibility for short-term benefits, as of the time of improper termination, which of course will require an assessment of whatever evidence she might present to establish her continued eligibility.\"  Id. Rather than \"leaving nothing to be done,\" the district court required further proceedings and findings on remand.  Applying the standard cited above to the remand order in this case, we conclude that the order is not a final judgment.  Therefore, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291 does not confer appellate jurisdiction over this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"collateral order\" doctrine developed in Cohen and later decisions does not apply in the circumstances of this case.  That doctrine is, in essence, \"a 'narrow exception to the normal application of the final judgment rule,' \" prescribed in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291.  Doughty, 6 F.3d at 862 (quoting Midland Asphalt Corp. v. United States, 489 U.S. 794, 798, 109 S.Ct. 1494, 1498, 103 L.Ed.2d 879 (1989)).  The collateral order doctrine is \"limited to orders that (1) conclusively determine (2) important legal questions which are (3) completely separate from the merits of the underlying action and are (4) effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\"  Doughty, 6 F.3d at 862.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue remanded to the plan in this case is not collateral;  Petralia's continued eligibility for benefits, the issue remanded to the plan, is the very heart of this case.  Consequently, the issue is effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment, and the rationale of the collateral order doctrine does not apply to this case.  Moreover, the issue has not been conclusively determined below, as required by the first prong of the collateral order doctrine.  \"[T]o come within the collateral order rule, a decree must definitively resolve the merits of the collateral issue, not merely determine which court will thereafter resolve it.\"  Id. at 863.   Because the order of the district court did not conclusively determine a legal question separate from the merits of the underlying action, and the issue remains subject to review on appeal from a final judgment, we conclude that the collateral order exception to the final judgment rule does not apply to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Mandamus or Other Prerogative Writ</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The initial briefs of the parties having failed to address the issue of appellate jurisdiction, the Panel questioned counsel about jurisdiction and allowed the filing of Supplemental Briefs.  Appellees acknowledged lack of appellate jurisdiction.  In her Supplemental Brief, Appellant argues that in Gillespie v. United States Steel Corp., 379 U.S. 148, 85 S.Ct. 308, 13 L.Ed.2d 199 (1964), the Court recognized \"what might well be called the 'twilight zone' of finality,\" id. at 152, 85 S.Ct. at 311, and asks us to take jurisdiction on the ground that otherwise Rosemary Petralia may be \"forever foreclosed\" from appellate review of \"the proof of her [claim of] chronic fatigue syndrome.\"   Supplemental Brief of Plaintiff/Appellant at 4. Although this request in the Supplemental Brief was not in the form of a petition for a prerogative writ, in the interests of assurance of fair process we address the request as if it were so designated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A writ of mandamus \"must be used stintingly and brought to bear only in extraordinary situations.\"  Doughty, supra, 6 F.3d at 865.   To show grounds for such extraordinary relief here, Rosemary Petralia would be required to demonstrate that the remand order was palpably erroneous and that she faces a special risk of irreparable harm.  Id. Plaintiff-Appellant has not made this showing since, as noted above, issues regarding her proof of her claim of chronic fatigue syndrome remain effectively reviewable on appeal from a final judgment, after one is ordered and entered.  See id. at 866.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>IV. Retention of Jurisdiction in the District Court</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily implicit in a district court's order of remand to a plan fiduciary is an understanding that after a new decision by the plan fiduciary, a party seeking judicial review in the district court may do so by a timely motion filed in the same civil action, and is not required to commence a new civil action.  To avoid any misunderstanding that might otherwise occur, we state that we interpret the order of the district court in this case as having retained jurisdiction, in this sense, to hear and decide any timely motion for judicial review filed after further proceedings before the plan fiduciary.  This is so regardless of whether the case is formally held open or instead administratively closed on the district court docket in the meantime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the remand order of the district court is not a final judgment, that the collateral order doctrine does not apply to the decision of the district court remanding an issue to the plan administrators, and, that a prerogative writ is not warranted, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.
