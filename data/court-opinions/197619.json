The same invoice  had been used\r                \r\n\nearlier to  impeach the ship's  captain, after he  denied knowing\r\n\nwhether any repairs were made  to the hoister after the accident.\r\n\nFurthermore, the trial judge promptly cautioned the jury that the\r\n\ninvoice was not to be  considered substantive evidence, but  only\r\n\nfor impeachment purposes.\r\n\n          Michigan nonetheless maintains that  the jury must have\r\n\ndisregarded the district court instruction.  It points to a later\r\n\njury  note:   \"Why  was  invoice for  repairs  not submitted  for\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nevidence?  Exactly  what did it show.\"   Thereafter, however, the\r\n\ntrial  judge firmly  disabused  the  jury  of  any  misconception\r\n\nportended by the note:\r\n\n               First, \"Why was  invoice for repairs not\r\n          submitted for  evidence?\"   Because it's  not\r\n          admissible under the laws of evidence and the\r\n          law governing this case.\r\n               So, in  answer to  the second  question,\r\n          I'll  have nothing to say about what it shows\r\n          or  not . . . or even  if it's an invoice for\r\n          repairs.  You  have heard those things  which\r\n          are admissible  and I  have charged you  with\r\n          respect to them. \r\n\n          Coupled with  its earlier instruction  that the invoice\r\n\ncould be considered only \"to get a handle on the believability of\r\n\nthe witnesses who  testified before [the jury], and  nothing else\r\n\nwhatsoever[,]\" the district court's later cautionary  instruction\r\n\nwas sufficient to keep  the jury on the proper track.
