The language of    3E1.1(b)(2) refers to  the date\r\n\nthat  the defendant \"notif[ies]  authorities of his intention\r\n\nto  enter a plea  of guilty,\" not  the date that  the plea is\r\n\nentered.   In this case,  notification occurred on  March 16,\r\n\n1995, the date on which the parties filed their executed plea\r\n\nagreement with  the court.
