We have read carefully the record in\n\nthis case, including the briefs of the parties.              We affirm\n\nthe grant of summary judgment to appellees essentially for\n\nthe reasons given by the bankruptcy court at the hearing\n\nheld on January 14, 1999.       We add only the following.\n\n            The Disclosure Statement, filed by debtors with the\n\nbankruptcy court and dated October 29, 1996, conclusively\n\nestablishes that, one month prior to entering into the\n\nsettlement agreement, the debtors were aware of the facts\n\nwhose non-disclosure they now allege induced them to make\n\nthat agreement.     Their claim is therefore without merit.\n\n            Moreover, in light of this fact, the court below\n\ncommitted    no   cognizable   error   in   not   granting    debtors'\n\nrequest for further discovery on this issue.           See Morrisey\n\nv. Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank, 54 F.3d 27, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (party seeking further discovery must show, inter\n\nalia, \"a plausible basis for [a] belief that facts exist\n\nthat would likely suffice to raise a genuine and material\n\nissue\").\n\n\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f           Finally, since appellees filed with the bankruptcy\n\ncourt an accounting of all payments they claim to have\n\nreceived and how those funds were credited, see Affidavit of\n\nPhilip M. O'Connor, Exh. A, they appear to have satisfied\n\nany duty they might have had to render an accounting to\n\ndebtors.   Since debtors have not brought forth any competent\n\nevidence to challenge the accuracy of this accounting, the\n\nentry of summary judgment was appropriate.\n\n           Affirmed.   See 1st Cir.
