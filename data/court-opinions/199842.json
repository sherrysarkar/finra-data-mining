Rao, Attorney, U.S. Dep't of Justice, with whom\nMichael J.

The poetess Nikki Giovanni once\n\ncommented that:          \"Mistakes are a fact of life.               It is the\n\nresponse    to    the    error    that   counts.\"        Elaine   Partnow,   The\n\nQuotable Woman:          1800-1981 453 (1983).             Defendant-appellant\n\nJoseph Bradshaw, a recidivist robber, would have done well to\n\nheed the message inherent in these words of wisdom.                   The tale\n\nfollows.\n\n            In the court below, the government charged that the\n\nappellant repeated and compounded the error of his ways.                 A jury\n\nagreed, convicting him on an array of charges, including armed\n\nrobbery and attempted murder.            Invoking the \"Three Strikes Law,\"\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3559(c), the district court sentenced the appellant\n\nto life imprisonment.            In this appeal,         Bradshaw — vigorously\n\nrepresented by able counsel — raises a substantial claim of jury\n\ntaint.     He also challenges various evidentiary rulings and the\n\nconstitutionality        of   the   Three      Strikes    Law.    Although   the\n\ngovernment       has    offered     us   surprisingly       little   help,   our\n\nperscrutation of the record and the case law persuades us that\n\nthe conviction and sentence must stand.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            We recount the relevant facts as the jury might have\n\nfound them, consistent with record support.                  In that exercise,\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fwe paint with a broad brush, reserving more extensive detail for\n\nour ensuing discussion of the appellant's specific claims.\n\n            The charges against the appellant stem from separate,\n\nbut related, incidents.           Our chronological narrative begins in\n\nthe spring of 1995, at which time the appellant's circle of\n\nfriends included Thomas Sutherland and the DeSimone brothers,\n\nRonald and Donald (colloquially known as \"Ronny\" and \"Donny\").\n\nRonny DeSimone told the appellant that, five mornings a week, a\n\nmail carrier transported large sums of money from the Lynn,\n\nMassachusetts post office to a nearby financial institution.\n\nThe two men repaired to Lynn and scouted the layout of the bank.\n\nThe appellant thereafter described the situation to Sutherland,\n\ntelling    him     that   Ronny   DeSimone   had   stumbled   upon   \"a   good\n\nscore.\"     The pair decided to rob the mail carrier and reward\n\nRonny by giving him ten percent of the take.\n\n            Sutherland and the appellant executed the robbery on\n\nJune 5, 1995.       When the mail carrier, Timothy Bogart, drove up\n\nto   the   bank,    Sutherland     commandeered    the   postal   truck   and\n\nordered Bogart, at gunpoint, to drive away.               After Bogart had\n\ngone a few blocks, Sutherland directed him to stop.               Sutherland\n\nthen snatched a mail tub containing more than $122,000 in cash\n\nand checks that had been sent by registered mail, and joined the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fappellant (who was waiting nearby in a rented station wagon).\n\nThe men departed in haste.\n\n           Later that same month, Sutherland and the appellant\n\ncame to suspect that the DeSimone brothers were cooperating in\n\nthe investigation of the robbery.             They decided that Donny\n\nDeSimone   had   to   be   killed.     The   appellant   recruited    Paul\n\nCourteau to assist in this grisly business.\n\n           On July 12, 1995, Courteau and the appellant, employing\n\na pretext, inveigled Donny DeSimone into accompanying them on a\n\nride.   The trio drove to various locations, eventually winding\n\nup at an unoccupied baseball field.          There, the appellant pulled\n\nout a handgun and attempted to test-fire it.             The gun jammed.\n\nNonplussed, he herded his companions back into the car and the\n\nthree men continued their meanderings.\n\n           In the early hours of the morning, they drove to a\n\nwooded area.     Courteau and the appellant exited the vehicle,\n\ntold Donny to stay put, and walked into the woods.                   A few\n\nmoments later, Donny heard a gunshot.         When the others returned,\n\nthe appellant pointed the gun at Donny and ordered him out of\n\nthe vehicle.     Charging that Donny was \"cooperating with the\n\nfeds,\" the appellant forced him to his knees, handed the gun to\n\nCourteau, and instructed Courteau to shoot.         Courteau pulled the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftrigger, but the gun jammed once again.        Donny lost little time\n\nin fleeing from the scene.\n\n           On July 8, 1998, a federal grand jury returned a nine-\n\ncount indictment against the appellant.        The indictment charged\n\nconspiracy to commit armed robbery, 18 U.S.C. § 371 (count 1);\n\nrobbery of a postal employee by use of a dangerous weapon, id.\n\n§ 2114 (count 2); using and carrying a firearm during and in\n\nrelation to a crime of violence, namely, the robbery, id. §\n\n924(c)(1) (count 3); conspiracy to tamper with a witness,             id.\n\n§ 371 (count 4); witness tampering by means of attempted murder,\n\nid. § 1512(a)(1)(A) (count 5); using and carrying a firearm\n\nduring and in relation to a crime of violence, namely, the\n\nattempted murder, id. § 924(c)(1) (count 6); obstruction of\n\njustice, id. § 1503 (count 7); conspiracy to obstruct justice,\n\nid. § 371 (count 8); and another incident of witness tampering\n\nby means of attempted murder, id. § 1512(a)(1)(A) (count 9).\n\nTwenty days later, the government filed an amended information\n\npursuant   to   the   Three   Strikes   Law,   18   U.S.C.   §   3559(c),\n\nnotifying the appellant that he was subject to a mandatory\n\nsentence of life imprisonment based upon an array of previous\n\nconvictions for \"serious violent felonies.\"             The qualifying\n\nconvictions, all obtained in the Massachusetts courts, included\n\na 1981 conviction for armed robbery, a 1987 conviction for\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\frobbery    and   assault    with   a    dangerous      weapon,      three    1988\n\nconvictions for armed robbery, and a 1989 conviction for armed\n\nrobbery.\n\n           Prior to the commencement of trial, the district court\n\nsevered counts 7 through 9 — a series of charges that revolved\n\naround an incident separate and apart from the robbery of the\n\npostal truck and the attempted murder of Donny DeSimone.1                   Trial\n\ncommenced on the first six counts on April 3, 2000.\n\n           At    trial,    the   court,      relying    on   Fed.    R.     Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E), conditionally admitted third-party testimony anent\n\ntwo sets of statements allegedly made by Sutherland.                      Citing\n\nFed. R. Evid. 403, the court later reversed its field and struck\n\nthat testimony.      In a separate ruling, the court denied the\n\nappellant's attempt, pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 804(b)(3), to\n\nintroduce evidence concerning other statements allegedly made by\n\nSutherland.\n\n           The court gave the case to the jury on April 24, 2000.\n\nThe next day, the foreman informed the judge that an extraneous\n\ndocument — an unredacted copy of a second superseding indictment\n\n\n\n    1Those three counts (which figure prominently in the claim\nof jury taint, see infra Part III) revolve around allegations\nthat, subsequent to his indictment and pretrial detention, the\nappellant enlisted the aid of a fellow inmate, William Niditch,\nto obstruct justice by committing perjury, and then tried to\nkill Niditch when Niditch became a government informant.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fcontaining the text of the three severed counts — had found its\n\nway   into    the   jury   room.    After   conducting   a   thorough\n\ninvestigation, the trial court dismissed one juror, denied the\n\nappellant's motion for a mistrial, and instructed the eleven\n\nremaining jurors to resume deliberations.2       On April 27, 2000,\n\nthe jury found the appellant guilty on all six counts.\n\n             At the disposition hearing, the appellant conceded the\n\nexistence of the prior convictions enumerated in the amended\n\ninformation, but asserted that he could not constitutionally be\n\nsentenced to life imprisonment under the Three Strikes Law.       The\n\ndistrict court rejected these importunings and sentenced the\n\nappellant to four concurrent terms of life imprisonment on\n\ncounts 1, 2, 4, and 5, to be followed by mandatory consecutive\n\nterms of five and twenty years, respectively, on counts 3 and 6.\n\nThis timely appeal followed.\n\n             We tackle the appellant's arguments in the order in\n\nwhich the underlying issues arose in the proceedings below.\n\nThus, we begin with the evidentiary rulings and then address the\n\n\n      2\n     The Criminal Rules sanction verdicts by eleven-person\njuries in certain circumstances.   See Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)\n(authorizing rendition of verdict by a jury of eleven if the\ntrial judge concludes, after deliberations have begun, that it\nis \"necessary\" to excuse a juror for \"just cause\"). Although\nthe appellant insists that the district court ought to have\ndeclared a mistrial because of jury taint, see infra Part III,\nhe does not challenge the verdict on the ground that it was\nreturned by a jury of fewer than twelve.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fappellant's principal claim:                 that the presence of a copy of the\n\nunredacted       indictment         in      the       jury    room       necessitated       the\n\ndeclaration of a mistrial.               Finally, we consider the appellant's\n\nassault on the constitutionality of the Three Strikes Law.\n\n\n\nII.   EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\n\n            We    divide       this      aspect       of     our   discussion       into    two\n\nsegments, corresponding to the appellant's assignments of error.\n\n A.   Conditionally Admitted Coconspirator Hearsay Statements.\n\n            The       appellant       maintains            that     the    district       court\n\ncommitted reversible error by initially admitting the DeSimones'\n\ntestimony    about       two     sets       of    statements            allegedly   made     by\n\nSutherland       and    then    failing          to   declare       a    mistrial    when    it\n\nsubsequently struck the conditionally admitted evidence.\n\n            According          to     the     witnesses,           Sutherland       and     the\n\nappellant arrived at the DeSimones' apartment shortly after the\n\nrobbery,    boasted       about       their       commission        of    the    crime,     and\n\ndistributed       a    portion      of    the     swag       to    the    DeSimones.        The\n\ngovernment       introduced         testimony           concerning         the   statements\n\nuttered while all four men were present, and the introduction of\n\nthat evidence is not contested on appeal.                            After receiving his\n\nshare of the proceeds, Ronny DeSimone left the apartment to\n\npurchase drugs.         In Ronny's absence Sutherland and the appellant\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fmade several statements to Donny DeSimone involving the details\n\nof   the    robbery.        The    admission        of    this   testimony     is   also\n\nuncontested.\n\n                 This brings us to the subject of the assigned error.\n\nBy the time that Ronny had returned to the apartment, the\n\nappellant had departed.             Over objection, Ronny testified that\n\nSutherland then related that he had been armed with a handgun,\n\nthat he had forced the mail carrier to drive away from the bank,\n\nand that a brown station wagon had been used as the getaway car.\n\n                 The second set of statements dates back to August of\n\n1995 — a period during which both Sutherland and Donny DeSimone\n\nwere incarcerated at the Plymouth House of Corrections.                             Over\n\nobjection, Donny testified that Sutherland acknowledged knowing\n\nabout      the    appellant's      attempt     to    murder      him,   and,   indeed,\n\nbragged      about      ordering    the    appellant        to   kill   both   of    the\n\nDeSimone brothers.\n\n                 The district court provisionally admitted both sets of\n\nstatements under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E).                      That rule permits\n\nthe introduction of a statement offered against a party if the\n\nstatement is made \"by a coconspirator of a party during the\n\ncourse      and    in   furtherance       of   the       conspiracy.\"      Id.       The\n\nproponent of the statement bears the burden of establishing, by\n\na preponderance of the evidence, \"that a conspiracy embracing\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fboth the declarant and the defendant existed, and that the\n\ndeclarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of the\n\nconspiracy.\"          United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1180\n\n(1st Cir. 1993); accord United States v. Petrozziello, 548 F.2d\n\n20, 23 (1st Cir. 1977).               If these conditions are met, and if\n\nthere is corroboration in the form of extrinsic evidence of the\n\ndeclarant's involvement in the conspiracy, then the hearsay\n\nbarrier    is     avoided      and     the     statement       may   be        admitted.\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1182.\n\n              This court has constructed a model for the handling of\n\nevidence      proffered       under     Rule    801(d)(2)(E).             That     model\n\nauthorizes      the    trial    court    to     admit    conditionally           alleged\n\ncoconspirator statements.             See United States v. Ciampaglia, 628\n\nF.2d   632,     638    (1st    Cir.   1980).      At     the   close      of    all   the\n\nevidence, the court then makes a final determination as to the\n\nadmissibility of the evidence.                  Id.     If the court ultimately\n\nconcludes that the provisionally admitted evidence does not\n\nsatisfy the applicable standard, it must \"give a cautionary\n\ninstruction to the jury, or, upon an appropriate motion, declare\n\na mistrial if the instruction will not suffice to cure any\n\nprejudice.\"      Id.\n\n              The appellant launches a two-pronged attack against the\n\ntrial court's treatment of the challenged statements.                          First, he\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fargues that the foundational requirements for admissibility were\n\nnot satisfied.         Second, he asseverates that the contingent\n\nadmission of the statements irretrievably poisoned the well, and\n\nthat, when it became apparent that the evidence was not properly\n\nin the case, the trial court abused its discretion in eschewing\n\na mistrial.      We consider each foray separately.\n\n            1.   Foundational Requirements.           Although the parties\n\nexpend considerable energy in disputing the correctness vel non\n\nof   the   district     court's   decision      to    admit   the   proffered\n\ntestimony conditionally, we need not determine whether the court\n\nhad an adequate foundational basis for doing so.              After all, the\n\ncourt struck the testimony at the close of all the evidence and\n\ninstructed the jurors to disregard it without telling them the\n\nrationale     behind    either    its   conditional      admission    or   its\n\nultimate exclusion.3       Because the jury never learned about the\n\ncourt's    specific    determination     that   the    statements    met   the\n\nfoundational requirements of Rule 801(d)(2)(E), it stands to\n\nreason that the jury could not have been prejudiced by that\n\ndetermination.     Accordingly, we turn without further ado to the\n\nappellant's contention that the district court improvidently\n\n\n     3\n     The court merely told the jury that \"[t]he reasons [for\nstriking the evidence] are several-fold and I don't think I\nreally need to get into them too deeply, except to say that the\nevidence seems to me to be far too attenuated for you to look to\nit or rely upon it.\"\n\n                                    -12-\n\fdenied his motion for a mistrial — a motion premised on the\n\nnotion     that        the     statements,       once     admitted,      engendered\n\nirretrievable and unfair prejudice (notwithstanding the fact\n\nthat the jury was subsequently instructed to disregard them).\n\n            2.        The Motion for Mistrial.           At the close of all the\n\nevidence,       the    trial    court    excluded       the   disputed   statements\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 403 (which provides for the exclusion\n\nof relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially\n\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the\n\nissues, or misleading the jury\").                  In itself, this is a rather\n\nunconventional use of the Ciampaglia model.                         Typically, as\n\nCiampaglia itself illustrates, 628 F.2d at 638, the district\n\ncourt    will    provisionally          admit    evidence      offered   under   Rule\n\n801(d)(2)(E), evaluate at the close of the evidence whether the\n\ngovernment has proven the prerequisites for admissibility by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence, and strike the evidence if it has\n\nnot.     Here, however, the trial court explicitly concluded that\n\nthe government had satisfied the requirements of Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(E),          yet   nonetheless        struck   the    disputed   evidence\n\nbecause of Rule 403 concerns.                   Although this was a somewhat\n\nunorthodox use of the Rule 801(d)(2)(E) model, we think that, as\n\na theoretical matter, it was within the court's authority.                        Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Van Nuys, 707 F. Supp. 465, 468 (D. Colo. 1989)\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f(concluding, after trial, that a significant amount of testimony\n\nadmitted   under     Rule   801(d)(2)(E)         should    have    been   excluded\n\npursuant to Rule 403).\n\n           As to the standard of review, all roads lead to Rome.\n\nWe review a trial court's balancing under Rule 403 for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    United States v. Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d 768, 774\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).      We likewise review decisions to deny motions\n\nfor mistrial for abuse of discretion.               United States v. Pierro,\n\n32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir. 1994).              We discern no abuse here.\n\n           The trial court found that the challenged statements\n\nwere    tangential    to    the    core    conspiracies       of    robbery    and\n\nattempted murder alleged in the indictment.                 Concerned that the\n\nunfairly prejudicial effect of the statements might outweigh\n\ntheir   probative     value,      the    court    struck    the    evidence    and\n\ninstructed the jury to disregard it.              The appellant argues that\n\nthis palliative was insufficient because the court could not\n\nunring the bell —       the evidence was so inflammatory that, once\n\nit was aired, no reasonable juror could be expected to disregard\n\nit.\n\n           Whether or not a jury can be expected, under proper\n\ninstructions, to disregard particular evidence is a judgment\n\ncall, and one as to which appellate courts typically cede a high\n\ndegree of deference to the trial court.               E.g., United States v.\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fFreeman, 208 F.3d 332, 344 (1st Cir. 2000) (upholding district\n\ncourt's    determination      that    curative         instruction     regarding\n\nevidence provisionally admitted but later stricken sufficiently\n\nshielded defendant from unfair prejudice).               We do not think that\n\nthe limits of that deference were tested here.\n\n           To be sure, the statements attributed to Sutherland\n\nwere unhelpful to the appellant, but their content was not\n\nshocking when measured against the rough-and-tumble evidence\n\nproperly   admitted    in    the   case.         Moreover,   it   is   routinely\n\npresumed that jurors will follow curative instructions and put\n\naside   matters   that      the    trial    court      determines      have   been\n\nimproperly admitted.        United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 740\n\n(1993); United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1287 (1st Cir.\n\n1996); Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1185.                 This presumption may be\n\novercome   only   by   showing      that    it    is   probable     that:     (1)\n\nresponsible jurors will be unable to disregard the testimony;\n\nand (2) the testimony likely will have a seriously prejudicial\n\neffect on the aggrieved party.              Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1185;\n\nUnited States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 160 (1st Cir. 1989).                    This\n\ninquiry is not conducted in a vacuum, but, rather, calls for an\n\nassessment of the impact of the stricken evidence in light of\n\nall the other evidence presented in the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f           Sepulveda illustrates the point.                  There, a police\n\ncommander was permitted to testify as an expert witness over the\n\ndefendant's objection.       15 F.3d at 1182.           When cross-examination\n\nrevealed that several of the opinions expressed by the witness\n\nlacked an adequate foundation, the defense moved midstream to\n\nstrike the whole of the testimony.                   The trial court obliged.\n\nId. at 1183.      Even though the district judge instructed the jury\n\nto disregard the stricken testimony, the defendant moved for a\n\nmistrial on the ground that it had so prejudiced the jury that\n\nno   curative    instruction      could   put    the     genie    back   into   the\n\nbottle.    Id. at 1183-84.\n\n           On appeal, we upheld the trial court's denial of the\n\nmotion.        We did not find the stricken testimony to be so\n\ncompelling that it threatened to sway the jury notwithstanding\n\nthe court's explicit instructions to disregard it.                  Id. at 1185.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, we stressed that the cumulative\n\nnature    of    the   stricken    testimony          completely    undercut     the\n\ndefendants' plaint that the testimony carried the specter of\n\nlingering prejudice.       Id.\n\n           So it is here.      Both sets of statements were cumulative\n\nin nature.       Sutherland's declarations to Ronny were largely\n\nduplicative      of   testimony    offered      by    numerous    witnesses     and\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fadmitted without opposition.4      Similarly, the central theme of\n\nthe second set of statements — the plot to kill Donny — was\n\nfleshed out by a mass of evidence including, inter alia, the\n\nappellant's own admissions and the introduction of the gun that\n\nhad   malfunctioned.      To   cinch    matters,   the    district   court\n\nexplicitly   admonished    the   jury    to   disregard    both   sets   of\n\nstatements, and gave a clear, concise curative instruction to\n\nthat effect.      In these circumstances, the appellant has not\n\nsuccessfully rebutted the presumption that the jury would follow\n\nthe judge's instructions.\n\n          That ends this leg of our journey.                We conclude,\n\nwithout serious question, that the lower court's refusal to\n\ngrant the appellant's motion for a mistrial fell well within the\n\nwide encincture of its discretion.\n\n             B.    Statements Against Penal Interest.\n\n          The appellant next calumnizes the district court's\n\nrefusal to admit the      testimony of two witnesses to the effect\n\nthat Sutherland had stated (in two separate conversations) that\n\nhe and Donny DeSimone had collogued to rob the robbers, that is,\n\nto steal the loot from the group that actually had hijacked the\n\n\n\n      4\n     For example, Donny testified that, on the day of the\nrobbery, Sutherland and the appellant collectively related\ndetails of the crime that were nearly identical to those that\nSutherland trumpeted after the appellant had left the apartment.\n\n                                  -17-\n\fpostal truck.     The appellant proffered this testimony under Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 804(b)(3), which carves out a hearsay exception for,\n\ninter alia, \"[a] statement which . . . at the time of its making\n\n. . . so far tended to subject the declarant to . . . criminal\n\nliability . . . that a reasonable person in the declarant's\n\nposition would not have made the statement unless believing it\n\nto be true.\"        Id.     Such third-party testimony may only be\n\nadmitted when the declarant is unavailable to testify.                         Id.\n\nFurthermore, an inculpatory statement \"tending to expose the\n\ndeclarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the\n\naccused\"     will     not     be        admitted      \"unless     corroborating\n\ncircumstances       clearly   indicate         the   trustworthiness     of    the\n\nstatement.\"     Id.\n\n            The district court refused to admit the testimony anent\n\nSutherland's      statements       on    two    grounds,   holding     that    the\n\nstatements were not against Sutherland's penal interest and, in\n\nall events, were not sufficiently corroborated.                   We review the\n\ntrial   court's     application         of    Rule   804(b)(3)   for   abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.     United States v. Patrick, 248 F.3d 11, 20, 23-24\n\n(1st Cir.), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 620 (2001).\n\n            The determination of whether a statement is against a\n\ndeclarant's penal interest depends on the outcome of a fact-\n\nintensive     inquiry       into        the     surrounding      circumstances.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fWilliamson v. United States, 512 U.S. 594, 603-04 (1994); United\n\nStates v. Costa, 31 F.3d 1073, 1077 (11th Cir. 1994).                                    Our\n\nreview of the record compels the conclusion that the court below\n\nadequately evaluated the context in which the alleged statements\n\nwere made.      In the course of that endeavor, the court concluded\n\nthat the tendered statements limned an alternative theory of the\n\ncrime    not    pursued       by    the     government,         and    represented         a\n\n\"sophisticated          and   subtle\"       effort      by   Sutherland          and     the\n\nappellant      to   avoid     criminal          responsibility        on   the   precise\n\ncharges lodged against them.                    On that basis, the court ruled\n\nthat    the    statements          were    not     against      Sutherland's           penal\n\ninterest.      That plausible rendition of the record was not an\n\nabuse of discretion.\n\n              At any rate, the district court's alternate ground for\n\nbarring the statements is rock-solid.                   The court concluded that\n\nthe corroborating evidence tendered by the appellant — that\n\nSutherland      allegedly       told      the    same   story    to    two   different\n\nindividuals on two separate occasions (hence, the two proffered\n\nstatements) and that Donny DeSimone admitted at trial that he\n\nhad told at least one other person that he had participated in\n\nthe robbery — was insufficient to establish the trustworthiness\n\nof the statements.            The strictures of Rule 804(b)(3) cannot be\n\nsatisfied      by   a    showing     of    speculative       possibilities,            but,\n\n\n                                           -19-\n\frather, demand meaningful corroboration of proffered testimony.\n\nSee United States v. Mackey, 117 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(\"[T]he requirement for corroboration is not unrealistically\n\nsevere but does go beyond minimal corroboration.\") (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted).           Measured by that yardstick,\n\nwe cannot say that the district court's refusal to accept these\n\nminimally   corroborative        evidentiary   fragments    as   sufficient\n\nindicia of trustworthiness constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\nIII.    JURY TAINT\n\n            The appellant's cardinal claim is that the jurors'\n\nbrief   exposure      to   the   text   of   the   three   severed     counts\n\nnecessitated a new trial.         In approaching this claim, we first\n\nexamine the appellant's assertion that the introduction of the\n\nunredacted indictment into the jury room, although accidental,\n\ntriggered    a   presumption       of   prejudice.         Rejecting     that\n\nproposition, we proceed to assess the trial court's handling of\n\nthe discovery that a deliberating jury had been exposed to\n\ninformation that carried the potential to do substantive damage.\n\nIn the end, we conclude that the district court did not misuse\n\nits discretion in concluding that the jury's ability to render\n\nan impartial verdict remained intact (and that, therefore, the\n\nappellant's due process rights had not been infringed).\n\n                 A.    The Presumption of Prejudice.\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f           The appellant's claim that the facts of this case\n\ndemand a presumption of prejudice derives from the Supreme\n\nCourt's   decision   in    Remmer   v.   United   States,   347   U.S.   227\n\n(1954).    There, as trial proceeded, a third party offered a\n\nbribe in exchange for a verdict favorable to the defendant.              Id.\n\nat 228.   The solicited juror informed the trial judge about the\n\nattempted bribery.        Id.   Instead of informing defense counsel,\n\nthe judge asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into\n\nthe matter.    Id.   The jury found Remmer guilty.          When he later\n\nlearned about the attempted bribery, he moved unsuccessfully for\n\na new trial.   The court of appeals affirmed the district court's\n\ndenial of this motion.          205 F.2d 277 (9th Cir. 1953).            The\n\nSupreme Court reversed, declaring that:\n\n           In   a     criminal    case,    any   private\n           communication,     contact,    or   tampering\n           directly or indirectly, with a juror during\n           a trial about the matter pending before the\n           jury   is,   for  obvious    reasons,  deemed\n           presumptively prejudicial . . . .         The\n           presumption is not conclusive, but the\n           burden rests heavily upon the Government to\n           establish, after notice to and hearing of\n           the defendant, that such contact with the\n           juror was harmless to the defendant.\n\n347 U.S. at 229.\n\n           Although the Remmer Court spoke in expansive terms, the\n\nCourt's holding has been cabined by two subsequent decisions.\n\nIn Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209 (1982), a sitting juror\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fsubmitted an application for employment as an investigator for\n\nthe district attorney's office.                  Id. at 212.         The district\n\nattorney revealed this information only after the jury on which\n\nthe job-seeker sat had convicted the defendant.                       Id. at 213.\n\nThe   trial    court     held    a    post-verdict      hearing      in   which     it\n\ndetermined that the pending application had not influenced the\n\njuror and denied the defendant's motion for a new trial.                     Id. at\n\n213-14.    The matter eventually reached the Supreme Court, which\n\nrejected      the    defendant's        argument       that    the      undisclosed\n\napplication     triggered        Remmer's        rebuttable      presumption        of\n\nprejudice.     Id. at 217 (explaining that \"due process does not\n\nrequire a new trial every time a juror has been placed in a\n\npotentially compromising situation\").                  The     Smith Court then\n\nruled   that   the     hearing       held   by   the   trial    court     after    the\n\nemployment application had surfaced was sufficient under the\n\ncircumstances.       See id. at 217-18.\n\n           More recently, the Court declined to apply the Remmer\n\npresumption     in   a   situation      in   which     alternate     jurors       were\n\npresent during jury deliberations.                See Olano, 507 U.S. at 737-\n\n39.     The Court held that the post-verdict inquiry into the\n\nfacts, which showed that the irregularity had occurred but that\n\nthe alternate jurors did not participate in the deliberations,\n\nafforded the defendant due process.                See id. at 739-41.\n\n\n                                        -22-\n\f           This court, too, has hesitated to apply the                    Remmer\n\npresumption indiscriminately.           The leading case is Boylan v.\n\nUnited States, 898 F.2d 230 (1st Cir. 1990).                There, a magazine\n\nleft   fortuitously     in    the   jury     room    contained     an    article\n\nsuggesting    that   counsel    for    one   of     the   defendants     was   the\n\nattorney of choice for \"[e]very troubled mobster\" in Boston.\n\nId. at 258 & n.17.     After guilty verdicts had been returned, the\n\ncirculation of this literature in the jury room was brought to\n\nlight.     The district court held a comprehensive post-verdict\n\nhearing but found that the defendants' due process rights had\n\nnot been infringed and denied their motions to set aside the\n\nverdict.      We   affirmed,    rejecting      a    claim   that   the    Remmer\n\npresumption applied.         Id. at 260-62.        We wrote:\n\n           [T]he [Remmer] presumption is applicable\n           only where there is an egregious tampering\n           or third party communication which directly\n           injects itself into the jury process. Put\n           another way, the Remmer standard should be\n           limited to cases of significant ex parte\n           contacts with sitting jurors or those\n           involving aggravated circumstances . . . .\n\nId. at 261.\n\n           We built upon this foundation in United States v.\n\nGomes, 177 F.3d 76 (1st Cir. 1999).                 There, a juror at the\n\ndefendant's second trial discovered a copy of the indictment\n\nthat apparently had been left in the jury room after the first\n\ntrial.     Id. at 82.        The indictment included, inter alia, a\n\n                                      -23-\n\fcharge on which the defendant had been acquitted at the first\n\ntrial.    Id.    The district court undertook an appropriate inquiry\n\nbut refused to apply the Remmer presumption.                       We upheld that\n\ndetermination, noting that while other aggravating circumstances\n\nmight justify the application of a Remmer-type presumption, such\n\na   presumption    was   unavailable         here   because       Remmer   involved\n\ndeliberate misconduct attributable to a party and that, in all\n\nevents, the Gomes jurors were not exposed to substantively\n\ndamaging information.       Id.\n\n           In the wake of Smith and Olano, one court has concluded\n\nthat Remmer is a dead letter.               See United States v. Sylvester,\n\n143 F.3d 923, 934 (5th Cir. 1998).                        Although    we   too   have\n\nquestioned Remmer's continuing vitality, see Gomes, 177 F.3d at\n\n83, we need not decide today whether, or to what extent, it\n\nremains good law.        Here, as in Boylan, the facts simply do not\n\nwarrant    the    application     of    a    Remmer       presumption.       Remmer\n\ninvolved   an    apparent   attempt         deliberately      to     influence    the\n\noutcome of the case through corrupt machinations.                     In contrast,\n\nthe record here is reasonably clear that the presence of the\n\nunredacted indictment in the jury room was due to an inadvertent\n\nerror by court personnel, and the appellant has not claimed that\n\nthe   document     was   insinuated         into    the    jury    room    for   some\n\nnefarious purpose.\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\f             Moreover, the Remmer Court was especially troubled by\n\nthe trial court's decision to request an FBI investigation based\n\non scanty information obtained during an ex parte meeting with\n\nthe prosecution.       Remmer, 347 U.S. at 228.      That element, too,\n\nis missing from the instant case.            Here, the trial judge kept\n\nall   counsel    apprised    and   engaged    throughout     his    in-depth\n\ninvestigation into the matter, and diligently fleshed out the\n\ncircumstances     of   the   taint-producing     incident.         Given   the\n\nabsence of any egregious circumstances, we conclude that Remmer\n\nis inapposite and decline to apply it here.5\n\n             In an effort to keep Remmer in play, the appellant\n\ncites two cases previously decided by this court.                  The first\n\nsuch case,      United States v. Santana, 175 F.3d 57 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), is clearly inapposite.         That case turned on the trial\n\ncourt's decision to permit the jury to consider, as evidence of\n\nguilt, information — a view of the defendant's ears — presented\n\nto it for the first time during deliberations.             See id. at 63-\n\n64.       Here, unlike in Santana, the information that the jury\n\nimproperly acquired during its deliberations (the unredacted\n\n\n\n      5\n     We leave for another day the question of whether a jury's\nexposure to substantively damaging information may sometimes\noccur under circumstances so aggravated as to warrant the\napplication of the Remmer presumption even without deliberate\nmisconduct (and if so, what those circumstances might comprise).\nThat question simply is not presented here.\n\n                                   -25-\n\findictment) was not received as evidence, and the court told the\n\njury, in no uncertain terms, to disregard it.\n\n            The appellant's reliance on United States v. Maguire,\n\n918 F.2d 254 (1st Cir. 1990), is similarly misplaced.                  There,\n\nthe trial judge erroneously instructed the venire during jury\n\nempanelment about a count that had been severed.                  See id. at\n\n266.     The court denied the defendant's motion for a mistrial,\n\nbut told the jury to disregard the reference to the severed\n\ncount.     Id.    The jury convicted the defendant.             We upheld the\n\nconviction, concluding that the error was harmless beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.        Id. at 266-68.            Although the panel did\n\nobserve, in dictum, that the \"reference to the severed count was\n\npresumptively       prejudicial,\"      id.    at    267,   we     reject   the\n\nappellant's effort to attach talismanic significance to that\n\nallusion.        The panel neither cited       Remmer nor conducted any\n\nanalysis    suggesting    that   it    was   undertaking   a     Remmer-based\n\ninquiry.\n\n            To conclude, we abjure any extension of the Remmer\n\npresumption to these facts.       The appellant's claim of jury taint\n\nmust be judged by more conventional standards.                  It is to that\n\ntask that we now turn.\n\n           B.    The Merits of the Appellant's Claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\f          We   start   this     phase   of   our   inquiry     by   revisiting\n\ncertain generally applicable legal principles.               We then describe\n\nthe trial court's investigation into the possibility of jury\n\ntaint, its findings, and its resolution of the matter.                 Finally,\n\nwe evaluate the court's handling of the situation.\n\n          1.    The Legal Landscape.         Where, as here, a colorable\n\nclaim of jury taint surfaces during jury deliberations,6 the\n\ntrial court has a duty to investigate the allegation promptly.\n\nUnited States v. Hunnewell, 891 F.2d 955, 961 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nThe purpose of that inquiry is twofold:               to ascertain whether\n\nsome taint-producing event actually occurred, and if so, to\n\nassess   the   magnitude   of    the    event   and    the    extent    of   any\n\nresultant prejudice.       Boylan, 898 F.2d at 258.             If the court\n\nfinds both a taint-producing event and a significant potential\n\nfor prejudice, the court must then consider the extent to which\n\n\n\n    6The case at bar involves a trial court's pre-verdict\nhandling of an allegation that a deliberating jury was\naccidentally exposed to substantively damaging information. The\ntiming of the court's inquiry distinguishes it from the vast\nmajority of the reported cases, most of which deal with claims\nof jury taint raised after the jury has returned a verdict.\nE.g., Smith, 455 U.S. at 213-14; Boylan, 898 F.2d at 262. In\nthat situation, appellate courts frequently have framed the\ninquiry in terms of harmless error, asking, in effect, whether\nthe trial court's determination that an improper outside\ninfluence did not taint the jury verdict was supportable. Where\nthe claim of jury taint surfaces before the jury has completed\nits deliberations, the harmless-error test is a poor fit (and,\ntherefore, of scant utility).\n\n                                   -27-\n\fprophylactic      measures   (such   as     the   discharge   of   particular\n\njurors   or    the   pronouncement    of    curative    instructions)    will\n\nsuffice to alleviate that prejudice.              See Gomes, 177 F.3d at 82.\n\nIn some instances, a likelihood of residual prejudice may remain\n\ndespite the court's best efforts.           In that event, the court must\n\ngrant a timely motion for a mistrial (if one is made).                   The\n\nobjective of this painstaking process is to ensure that the\n\nparties \"receive[] the trial by an unbiased jury to which the\n\nConstitution entitles them.\"         United States v. Anello, 765 F.2d\n\n253, 258 (1st Cir. 1985).\n\n              Conducting an inquiry into a colorable question of jury\n\ntaint is a delicate matter, and there is no pat procedure for\n\nsuch an inquiry.       Evans v. Young, 854 F.2d 1081, 1083-84 (7th\n\nCir. 1988) (explaining that trial courts have wide discretion to\n\nevaluate pre-verdict claims of alleged jury misconduct as they\n\ndeem appropriate); Hunnewell, 891 F.2d at 961 (stating that the\n\ntrial court has \"considerable leeway\" in determining how to\n\nstructure its investigation); see also Boylan, 898 F.2d at 258\n\n(noting that \"the kaleidoscopic variety of possible problems\n\ncounsels in favor of flexibility\").                Consequently, the trial\n\ncourt has wide discretion to fashion an appropriate procedure\n\nfor assessing whether the jury has been exposed to substantively\n\n\n\n\n                                     -28-\n\fdamaging information, and if so, whether cognizable prejudice is\n\nan inevitable and ineradicable concomitant of that exposure.\n\n            2.        The Proceedings Below. This brings us                   to   the\n\nproceedings below.            The introduction of an extraneous document\n\ninto the jury room during deliberations is always a cause for\n\nconcern.       The intrusion was effected in this instance by an\n\nindictment       —    an   official       document    bearing     the    government's\n\nimprimatur.          That document contained three counts that were not\n\nbefore the jury, and those counts charged the appellant with\n\nserious malefactions (of which the jury had no other knowledge).\n\nThus, the acknowledged presence of the unredacted indictment in\n\nthe jury room gave rise to a colorable claim of actual prejudice\n\nand posed a significant threat to the jurors' ability to render\n\nan impartial verdict.               The question, then, reduces to whether\n\nthe   trial      court       investigated       the   claim     appropriately       and\n\nresolved it in a satisfactory manner.\n\n            The lower court recognized these realities.                            Upon\n\nlearning that the unredacted indictment had infiltrated the jury\n\nroom,    the   court         immediately       alerted    counsel    and   solicited\n\nsuggestions          about    the    most      advisable    way     to   handle    the\n\nsituation. Adopting defense counsel's recommendation, the court\n\nassembled the jurors, informed them of the need for an inquiry,\n\nand     instructed         them     not   to    discuss    the    matter     amongst\n\n\n                                            -29-\n\fthemselves.    The court then proceeded to interview the jurors\n\none by one.\n\n           Although the individual voir dire examinations revealed\n\nsome slight discrepancies in the jurors' accounts concerning\n\ntheir exposure to the text of the unredacted indictment, the\n\ndifferences   are   not   material   here.      For   the   most   part,    a\n\nconsistent picture emerged.          The jurors agreed that, at the\n\nstart of the second day of deliberations, one of their number\n\nnoticed a copy of the indictment that contained some \"extra\"\n\ncounts.    He mentioned this oddity to his fellow venirepersons,\n\nand, at the urging of some of them, read aloud the text of count\n\n7 (an obstruction of justice charge).         After a brief discussion,\n\nthe jurors concluded that the document did not belong in the\n\njury room, and the jury foreman brought it to the court security\n\nofficer.   He told the officer that:         \"We found this document in\n\nthe group of materials and it doesn't seem to belong there.                It\n\nhas more counts than are in the verdict slip.\"\n\n           After    concluding   this    initial   round    of   voir   dire\n\nexaminations, the trial court made the following finding (out of\n\nthe jurors' earshot):\n\n           There   are   inconsistencies  among  the\n           recollections. . . . None of them seem to\n           be material.   There is a core quality to\n           this: First, a recognition that there was\n           something unusual; second, a recognition\n           that there was something that was not\n\n                                  -30-\n\f          properly before them; number three, their\n          recognition that they should put it out of\n          their deliberations, certain facts and\n          circumstances . . . .        In fact, they\n          responded — from my perspective — precisely\n          the way jurors are supposed to respond . . .\n          if   they   were   exposed   to   extraneous\n          information, including bringing it to my\n          attention . . . .\n\nThe court then reassembled the jurors, instructed them that it\n\nwas their duty to decide the case based on their \"evaluation\n\nonly of the evidence that's presented to you here in trial and\n\nnot by consideration of other extraneous matters,\" and launched\n\ninto a strongly-worded curative instruction.7   At that juncture,\n\nthe court undertook a second round of individual voir dire\n\nexaminations, this time focusing on each individual juror's\n\nability to \"put out of [his or her] mind[] entirely the facts\n\nand circumstances of the extraneous document\" so that he or she\n\nmight decide the case solely on the evidence introduced at\n\ntrial.   Eleven of the twelve jurors expressed confidence that\n\n\n\n    7The court stated in pertinent part:\n\n    [T]hroughout, I've been telling you that you decide\n    this case solely on the basis of evidence that's\n    actually presented to you. . . .     [T]his extraneous\n    document   to  which   you  were   unfortunately   and\n    inadvertently exposed which has nothing to do with the\n    charges in this case, should not be considered a part\n    of the charges in this case. Your responsibility, as\n    I said, is to decide this case solely on the basis of\n    evidence that was presented to you as to Counts 1\n    through 6.\n\n                             -31-\n\fthey could function in that pristine fashion and satisfied the\n\ncourt of their ability to do so.          Without objection, the court\n\ndismissed the lone dissenter.          After rejecting the appellant's\n\nchallenges to three additional jurors, the judge directed the\n\nremaining jurors to resume deliberations with a view toward\n\nreaching a verdict.      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b).\n\n          3.   The Adequacy of the Trial Court's Handiwork.              We\n\nnow test the trial court's handiwork against the abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion benchmark.      See Boylan, 898 F.2d at 262; Hunnewell,\n\n891 F.2d at 961.    In this context, however, review for abuse of\n\ndiscretion connotes a certain rigor.\n\n          As we use the term, the abuse-of-discretion standard\n\nencompasses multiple layers of inquiry.              See Koon v.     United\n\nStates, 518 U.S. 81, 98-100 (1996).            Under it, we accept the\n\ntrial court's factual findings only to the extent that they are\n\nnot clearly erroneous.      United States v. Castro, 129 F.3d 226,\n\n229 (1st Cir. 1997).      We next examine the legal principles on\n\nwhich the court premised its decision, mindful that an error of\n\nlaw invariably constitutes an abuse of discretion.            In re Grand\n\nJury   Subpoena,   138   F.3d   442,    444   (1st   Cir.   1998).     This\n\nparticular inquiry is conducted without any special deference to\n\nthe trial court's views, United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65,\n\n67 (1st Cir. 1998), and extends to the court's application of\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\fthe law to the facts as found.             Only then do we ask whether,\n\ngiven     the   totality    of    the    circumstances    then   and      there\n\nobtaining, the sum of the trial court's acts and                  omissions\n\nconstituted a misuse of its discretion.\n\n            Starting from this vantage point, we turn first to the\n\nprocedure employed below.         For all practical purposes, the lower\n\ncourt replicated the Boylan model — a model that we previously\n\nhave deemed \"methodologically sound.\"              898 F.2d at 259.         The\n\ncourt engaged counsel for both sides in an ongoing dialogue\n\nabout the most appropriate way in which to handle the needed\n\ninvestigation, examined each juror twice, and pursued no fewer\n\nthan eight lines of questioning proposed by defense counsel.\n\nThe court's probing into the extent of the jurors' exposure to\n\nthe extraneous information and its potential impact on their\n\nability    to    render    an    impartial     verdict   was   thorough    and\n\nincisive.       The court gave the jury clear and emphatic curative\n\ninstructions.       Last — but surely not least — the court made\n\nexplicit findings that are amply rooted in the transcript of the\n\ntwo rounds of voir dire examinations and that make considerable\n\nsense when scrutinized against the record of the trial as a\n\nwhole.\n\n            The appellant raises two specific objections to the\n\ntrial court's findings.           First, the appellant takes aim at a\n\n\n                                        -33-\n\fstatement made by a retained juror during the second round of\n\nquestioning.     When pressed by the judge to expound upon his\n\ncomment that \"the gravity of the discussion weighs some,\" the\n\njuror responded that:    \"I believe that the outcome of the trial\n\nand the verdict turns on the very unexpected and serious change\n\nin the evidence presented.\"        Considered in isolation, that\n\ncomment might raise a reader's eyebrow — but the colloquy that\n\nensued between the judge and the juror makes manifest that the\n\njuror's remark was not a cause for concern.       In that colloquy,\n\nthe juror assured the judge that he would not consider the\n\nextraneous material and characterized his earlier statement as\n\n\"a poor choice of words.\"        Viewed in that light, we do not\n\nbelieve   that   the   court's   decision   to   retain   the   juror\n\nconstituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n          Second, the appellant argues that the court's finding\n\nthat the incident yielded no residuum of unfair prejudice failed\n\nto take into account that the jury's exposure to the severed\n\ncounts undermined his principal trial strategy.     In this regard,\n\ndefense counsel credibly claimed that she had made a conscious\n\ndecision to avoid any reference to the Niditch incident (which\n\ncomprised the subject matter of the three severed counts, see\n\nsupra note 1) in order to preclude \"opening the door\" to the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\fgovernment's introduction of \"highly charged\" evidence related\n\nto that topic.\n\n           The problem with this argument is that the inadvertent\n\nexposure of the jury to the unredacted indictment did not lead\n\nto the introduction of any evidence concerning the Niditch\n\nincident, and the court found as a fact that the retained jurors\n\nwere fully able to put aside their brief encounter with the\n\nallegations contained in the severed counts.     The fact that the\n\nexposure was to an indictment, rather than to information of\n\nevidentiary quality, weighs in the government's favor.        Before\n\ndeliberations commenced (and, thus, before any exposure to the\n\nextraneous   information    occurred),   the   court   had   clearly\n\nexplained that \"[t]he indictment is the document that frames the\n\nissues, the charges, the criminal violations that the Government\n\nbelieves it can prove.     But . . . the indictment isn't evidence\n\n. . . .   It's simply the document that you look to to understand\n\nwhat it is that the Government is undertaking to prove in this\n\ncase.\"    The court reinforced this instruction by telling the\n\njurors, after the unredacted indictment surfaced, to \"[p]ut\n\nentirely out of your mind any exposure any of you may have had\n\nto earlier forms of the kinds of charges the Government was\n\nthinking about here.\"    Appellate courts ordinarily presume that\n\na jury will follow the trial judge's specific instructions in a\n\n\n                                -35-\n\fcriminal case, e.g., Olano, 507 U.S. at 740; Houlihan, 92 F.3d\n\nat 1287; Sepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1185, and there is no reason to\n\nabandon that presumption here.\n\n              In    sum,    the   record    reflects      that    the    lower       court\n\nhandled its investigation into the \"jury taint\" question with\n\nconsummate care.           Its detailed findings and its conclusion that\n\nthe jurors' accidental exposure to the unredacted indictment\n\ncaused no ineradicable prejudice are fully supportable.                                In\n\nwords that resonate here, the Smith Court observed that \"[d]ue\n\nprocess means a jury capable and willing to decide the case\n\nsolely   on     the    evidence      before    it,   and   a     trial       judge   ever\n\nwatchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the\n\neffect of such occurrences when they happen.\"                     455 U.S. at 217.\n\nThe    court       below   carried    out     this   mandate      to     the    letter.\n\nConsequently, we hold that the court acted well within the scope\n\nof its discretion in structuring the inquiry into the question\n\nof jury taint, in excusing a single juror, and in concluding\n\nthat   the     remaining      jurors'      ability   to    render       an    impartial\n\n\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\fverdict had not been compromised.8        The appellant received all\n\nthe process that was due.\n\nIV.   THE THREE STRIKES LAW\n\n           In this case, the district court invoked the Three\n\nStrikes Law, 18 U.S.C. § 3559(c), to sentence the appellant to\n\nmultiple terms of life imprisonment.          The appellant challenges\n\nthat determination on constitutional grounds.        Before addressing\n\nthis challenge, we describe the statutory scheme.\n\n           The Three Strikes Law is of relatively recent vintage.\n\nIt dictates mandatory life imprisonment for any person convicted\n\nin a federal court of a \"serious violent felony\" if, inter alia,\n\nthat person has been convicted on two or more prior occasions of\n\n\"serious   violent   felonies.\"     Id.   §   3559(c)(1)(A)(i).    The\n\nstatute characterizes various federal and state offenses as\n\n\n      8\n      Citing Santana, 175 F.3d at 65, and Lacy v. Gardino, 791\nF.2d 980, 982-83 (1st Cir. 1986), the appellant posits that\nwhere, as here, extrinsic information is considered by the jury,\nharmless error analysis must apply. But those cases involved\nthe jury's consideration of information of evidentiary quality,\nand the claim of jury taint arose after trial (when any harm\ncould not be undone). Here, however, the harmless-error test is\na poor fit. See supra note 6. The matter came to the trial\njudge's attention before the jury reached a verdict, and the\njudge, after due investigation, gave a timely curative\ninstruction. Furthermore, the information to which the jury was\nexposed was not evidence; the retained jurors warranted that\nthey would not consider it; and they added that, in all events,\nwhat they had seen or heard would not influence their judgment.\nUnder these vastly different circumstances, there is no\nconstitutional error and, hence, no need for harmless error\nanalysis.\n\n                                  -37-\n\fserious violent felonies.      It places three federal robbery\n\nstatutes in this category, and, pertinently, adds a generic\n\ndefinition that encompasses:\n\n         [A]ny other offense punishable by a maximum\n         term of imprisonment of 10 years or more\n         that has as an element the use, attempted\n         use, or threatened use of physical force\n         against the person of another or that, by\n         its nature, involves a substantial risk that\n         physical force against the person of another\n         may be used in the course of committing the\n         offense.\n\nId. § 3559(c)(2)(F)(ii).\n\n         The Three Strikes Law also includes a disqualification\n\nprovision that offers a criminal defendant the opportunity to\n\nremove some crimes that otherwise would qualify as serious\n\nviolent felonies (and, therefore, count as \"strikes\") from the\n\n\"three strikes\" calculation.      The disqualification provision\n\nstates, in relevant part, that:\n\n         (A) Robbery, an attempt, conspiracy, or\n         solicitation to commit robbery . . . shall\n         not serve as a basis for sentencing under\n         this subsection if the defendant establishes\n         by clear and convincing evidence that —\n\n         (i) no firearm or other dangerous weapon was\n         used in the offense and no threat of use of\n         a firearm or other dangerous weapon was\n         involved in the offense; and\n\n         (ii) the offense did not result in death or\n         serious bodily injury . . . to any person.\n\n\n\n\n                               -38-\n\fId. § 3559(c)(3)(A)(i)-(ii).                 The disqualification provision\n\nplaces the burden of proof squarely on the defendant to prove by\n\nclear    and    convincing        evidence      that,    notwithstanding        the\n\ngovernment's allegations, his prior felony convictions do not\n\nconstitute qualifying offenses.               See id.\n\n            In this venue, the appellant does not quarrel with the\n\ndistrict court's finding that, on their face, the six prior\n\nconvictions catalogued by the government constitute \"strikes\"\n\nunder the Three Strikes Law.                 He does, however, advance two\n\narguments      that       implicate    the   law's   constitutionality.          We\n\nconsider these arguments sequentially.\n\n                                  A.    Apprendi.\n\n            The appellant contests the power of the court to take\n\nthe prior convictions into account, noting that they had neither\n\nbeen referenced in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.           Thus, his thesis runs, the Supreme Court's\n\nrecent decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000),\n\nprohibits the imposition of an enhanced sentence.\n\n            This argument is a non-starter.                   The core holding of\n\nApprendi is that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,\n\nany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the\n\nprescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\n\nproved   beyond       a    reasonable    doubt.\"        Id.    at   490   (emphasis\n\n\n                                         -39-\n\fsupplied).         We think the Court meant exactly that — and we have\n\nsaid so.\n\n              We    recently       considered         and    rejected       a    materially\n\nindistinguishable argument in United States v. Gomez-Estrada,\n\n273 F.3d 400, 401 (1st Cir. 2001).                          We noted there that the\n\nApprendi       Court           explicitly       exempted          sentence-enhancement\n\nprovisions based upon prior criminal convictions from the scope\n\nof its holding.           Id. at 402 (citing Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490);\n\nsee also Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 226-\n\n27, 247 (1998) (upholding Congress's decision to treat prior\n\nconvictions as a sentencing factor rather than an element of a\n\nfederal criminal offense).                 Because we have ruled unequivocally\n\nthat    the   strictures          of   Apprendi       do    not    apply    to    sentence-\n\nenhancement provisions based upon prior criminal convictions,\n\nsee Gomez-Estrada, 273 F.3d at 401-02; United States v. Terry,\n\n240 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1965\n\n(2001), we reject the appellant's Apprendi-based challenge.\n\n                    B.     Shifting of the Burden of Proof.\n\n              The appellant's second argument is more sophisticated.\n\nHe says that 18 U.S.C. § 3559(c)(3)(A) violates constitutional\n\ndue process guarantees because it shifts the burden of proof to\n\nthe    defendant         and    requires      him    to    establish       by    \"clear   and\n\nconvincing\"         evidence           that     his        prior     convictions          are\n\n\n                                              -40-\n\fnonqualifying (and, hence, not countable as \"strikes\" under the\n\nThree Strikes Law).             Refined to bare essence, the appellant's\n\nthesis     is    that    the    disqualification           provision      violates    due\n\nprocess in two related ways:                  (1) by requiring the defendant to\n\nprove that previous offenses are nonqualifying, and (2) by\n\nrequiring that he do so under a heightened standard.                             These\n\nconstitutional claims engender de novo review.                      United States v.\n\nZorrilla,        93    F.3d    7,   8   (1st    Cir.     1996);    United    States    v.\n\nGifford, 17 F.3d 462, 471-72 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n                Our starting point is the Court's decision in Patterson\n\nv.   New   York,        432    U.S.     197    (1977).      There,     the   defendant\n\nchallenged a New York law that permitted a person accused of\n\nmurder to invoke the affirmative defense of \"extreme emotional\n\ndisturbance\" to mitigate the charged crime to manslaughter.                           Id.\n\nat 198-99 & nn.2-3.            The New York criminal code assigned to the\n\ndefendant the burden of establishing the \"extreme emotional\n\ndisturbance\" defense by a preponderance of the evidence.                         Id. at\n\n200.     The defendant failed in his effort to mitigate the charge\n\nagainst him, and appealed his murder conviction on the ground\n\nthat the burden-shifting component contravened due process.\n\n                Noting that it was well within the state's power to\n\ncriminalize           intentional       killings     and    mete    out     substantial\n\npunishment to individuals convicted of such crimes, the Supreme\n\n\n                                              -41-\n\fCourt emphasized that, incident thereto, the state had the power\n\nto recognize factors that mitigated the degree of criminality or\n\npunishment.      Id. at 209.      As a logical consequence, the state\n\nwas entitled to \"assure itself that the [mitigating] fact has\n\nbeen established with reasonable certainty\" by requiring the\n\ndefendant   to   prove    such    a   fact   by   a    preponderance     of   the\n\nevidence.     Id.       Thus, as long as the state has proven all\n\nelements    of    the     crime   beyond     a    reasonable       doubt,     its\n\nreallocation of the burden of proof in an affirmative defense\n\ndid not violate due process.           See id. at 205-06.\n\n            Whereas Patterson raised his affirmative defense at\n\ntrial, the Three Strikes Law comes into play at the sentencing\n\nstage of a criminal proceeding.               But this is a distinction\n\nwithout a difference:        the sentencing process is surely no more\n\nexacting than the process of establishing guilt.                  It therefore\n\nstands to reason that Patterson applies with equal force to\n\nburden-shifting     affirmative       defenses        made   available   at   the\n\nsentencing stage of criminal proceedings — and that such a\n\nparadigm does not offend the Constitution.               Accord United States\n\nv. Wicks, 132 F.2d 383, 389 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"If Patterson\n\nallows such a result even at the stage of the trial where guilt\n\nor innocence is decided, it follows that due process does not\n\n\n\n\n                                      -42-\n\fprohibit the kind of affirmative defense at the sentencing stage\n\nfound in § 3559(c)(3)(A).\").\n\n              An equally germane consideration is that antecedent\n\n\"strikes\" that factor into the Three Strikes calculation take\n\nthe form of prior convictions.           The Supreme Court has upheld a\n\nstate sentence enhancement provision requiring a recidivist\n\ndefendant to shoulder the burden of proof of establishing the\n\ninvalidity of prior convictions.           Parke v. Raley, 506 U.S. 20,\n\n34    (1992).     The   Court   reasoned    that   the   \"'presumption       of\n\nregularity'      that   attaches    to     final     judgments\"    made      it\n\nappropriate to assign a proof burden to the defendant.                   Id. at\n\n29.     Like the contested state statute in Parke, the Three\n\nStrikes Law initially presumes that prior convictions falling\n\nunder one of the statutorily enumerated definitions are valid,\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3559(c)(1)-(2), and then provides the defendant with\n\nthe opportunity to disqualify the convictions, id. § 3559(c)(3).\n\n              Taken together, Patterson and Parke convince us that\n\na paradigm that allows the defendant to raise an affirmative\n\ndefense during the sentencing phase of criminal proceedings, but\n\nthen shifts the burden of proof to him to establish the defense,\n\ndoes not violate due process.        Nor is this an eccentric view of\n\nthe    law:      several   other   courts     have    reached     this    same\n\nconclusion.     See United States v. Gatewood, 230 F.3d 186, 189-90\n\n\n                                   -43-\n\f(6th Cir. 2000) (en banc), cert. denied, 70 U.S.L.W. 3443 (No.\n\n01-7283) (Jan. 14, 2002); United States v. Ferguson, 211 F.3d\n\n878, 887 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 909 (2000); United\n\nStates v. Smith, 208 F.3d 1187, 1190 (10th Cir. 2000); United\n\nStates v. Kaluna, 192 F.3d 1188, 1196 (9th Cir. 1999) (en banc);\n\nWicks, 132 F.2d at 389.\n\n           The appellant's related asseveration is that section\n\n3559(c)(3)(A)'s placement of a heightened evidentiary burden on\n\ncriminal   defendants   —   clear     and   convincing   evidence     —\n\ncontravenes their right to due process.9      This asseveration also\n\nlacks force.\n\n           It is transparently clear that Congress had the power\n\nto enact a law that mandated life imprisonment for recidivist\n\nfelons who committed a series of serious violent felonies or\n\ndrug offenses.   Although it was not constitutionally required to\n\ndo so, Congress thought it efficacious to include a provision\n\nthat exempted a particular subset of offenses from consideration\n\nas \"strikes.\"    Given that Congress was under no obligation to\n\nprovide defendants with such a dispensation in the first place,\n\nthere is no principled reason why Congress could not craft such\n\na provision in the manner that it deemed appropriate.               See\n\n\n    9Interestingly, the appellant offers no enlightenment as to\nhow, if a heightened standard did not obtain, he might be able\nto \"disqualify\" any or all of his six prior convictions.\n\n                               -44-\n\fGatewood, 230 F.3d at 191.            As the Sixth Circuit astutely\n\nobserved:\n\n            If Congress can choose whether or not to\n            provide a defense, it follows that the\n            burden of proof Congress places on such a\n            defense cannot be unconstitutional. . . .\n            It is the prerogative of the legislative\n            branch to determine whether a recidivist\n            defendant   is   subject   to  an  enhanced\n            statutory punishment and what, if any,\n            affirmative    defense   applies  after   a\n            defendant has previously been adjudged\n            guilty.\n\nId.\n\n            The appellant avers that Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.S.\n\n348 (1996), compels a different conclusion.               We do not agree.\n\nCooper involved a constitutional challenge to an Oklahoma law\n\nthat presumed a criminal defendant competent to stand trial\n\nunless    she   mustered     clear    and    convincing    proof     of   her\n\nincompetence.     Id. at 350.        A unanimous Supreme Court struck\n\ndown the law on the ground that the heightened evidentiary\n\nstandard violated due process.          Id. at 369.      Starting with the\n\nbedrock   principle   that    the    state   can   try   only   a   competent\n\ncriminal defendant, the Court ruled that this principle trumped\n\nthe state's interest in ensuring the efficient operation of its\n\ncriminal justice system through the application of a heightened\n\nstandard of proof.    Id. at 367.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -45-\n\f            The competency statute that the Cooper Court annulled\n\nis clearly distinguishable from the disqualification provision\n\nin the Three Strikes Law.             The crux of the matter is that a\n\ncriminal defendant has a fundamental constitutional right not to\n\nbe forced to stand trial while incompetent — but he has no\n\ncomparable right to a statutorily created affirmative defense.\n\nSee   Gatewood,    230    F.3d   at    191    (\"There         is    no    fundamental\n\nconstitutional right to avoid an enhanced sentence based on\n\nprior convictions simply because the prior convictions were\n\nnonviolent.\").      The Cooper Court drove home that precise point\n\nby expressly distinguishing the Oklahoma competency provision\n\nfrom the statutorily created affirmative defense addressed and\n\napproved in Patterson.       See Cooper, 517 U.S. at 367-68 (\"Unlike\n\nPatterson, which concerned procedures for providing a statutory\n\ndefense, we consider here whether a State's procedures for\n\nguaranteeing a fundamental constitutional right are sufficiently\n\nprotective of that right.\").\n\n            That   gets   the    grease      from       the   goose.        Since   the\n\ndisqualification      provision        in    the        Three      Strikes    Law     is\n\nfunctionally equivalent to the statutory affirmative defense\n\ndiscussed in Patterson, the holding in Cooper is inapposite\n\nhere.      It   follows   inexorably        that    the       burden      placed    upon\n\ncriminal    defendants     to    establish         by    clear      and    convincing\n\n\n                                      -46-\n\fevidence that their prior convictions are nonqualifying offenses\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3559(c)(3) is not incompatible with due\n\nprocess.    Accord Gatewood, 230 F.3d at 191; Ferguson, 211 F.3d\n\nat 887.\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We   need   go   no   further.   Having   canvassed   the\n\nappellant's asseverational array and rejected his sundry claims\n\nof error, we affirm the judgment below.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -47-\n\f",

Defendant-appellant Joseph Bradshaw, a recidivist robber, would have done well to heed the message inherent in these words of wisdom. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the court below, the government charged that the appellant repeated and compounded the error of his ways. A jury agreed, convicting him on an array of charges, including armed robbery and attempted murder. Invoking the \"Three Strikes Law,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c), the district court sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment. In this appeal, Bradshaw &#8212; vigorously represented by able counsel &#8212; raises a substantial claim of jury taint. He also challenges various evidentiary rulings and the constitutionality of the Three Strikes Law. Although the government has offered us surprisingly little help, our perscrutation of the record and the case law persuades us that the conviction and sentence must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the relevant facts as the jury might have found them, consistent with record support. In that exercise, we paint with a broad brush, reserving more extensive detail for our ensuing discussion of the appellant's specific claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charges against the appellant stem from separate, but related, incidents. Our chronological narrative begins in the spring of 1995, at which time the appellant's circle of friends included Thomas Sutherland and the DeSimone brothers, Ronald and Donald (colloquially known as \"Ronny\" and \"Donny\"). Ronny DeSimone told the appellant that, five mornings a week, a mail carrier transported large sums of money from the Lynn, Massachusetts post office to a nearby financial institution. The two men repaired to Lynn and scouted the layout of the bank. The appellant thereafter described the situation to Sutherland, telling him that Ronny DeSimone had stumbled upon \"a good score.\" The pair decided to rob the mail carrier and reward Ronny by giving him ten percent of the take.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sutherland and the appellant executed the robbery on June 5, 1995. When the mail carrier, Timothy Bogart, drove up to the bank, Sutherland commandeered the postal truck and ordered Bogart, at gunpoint, to drive away. After Bogart had gone a few blocks, Sutherland directed him to stop. Sutherland then snatched a mail tub containing more than $122,000 in cash and checks that had been sent by registered mail, and joined the appellant (who was waiting nearby in a rented station wagon). The men departed in haste.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that same month, Sutherland and the appellant came to suspect that the DeSimone brothers were cooperating in the investigation of the robbery. They decided that Donny DeSimone had to be killed. The appellant recruited Paul Courteau to assist in this grisly business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 12, 1995, Courteau and the appellant, employing a pretext, inveigled Donny DeSimone into accompanying them on a ride. The trio drove to various locations, eventually winding up at an unoccupied baseball field. There, the appellant pulled out a handgun and attempted to test-fire it. The gun jammed. Nonplussed, he herded his companions back into the car and the three men continued their meanderings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early hours of the morning, they drove to a wooded area. Courteau and the appellant exited the vehicle, told Donny to stay put, and walked into the woods. A few moments later, Donny heard a gunshot. When the others returned, the appellant pointed the gun at Donny and ordered him out of the vehicle. Charging that Donny was \"cooperating with the feds,\" the appellant forced him to his knees, handed the gun to Courteau, and instructed Courteau to shoot. Courteau pulled the trigger, but the gun jammed once again. Donny lost little time in fleeing from the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 8, 1998, a federal grand jury returned a nine-count indictment against the appellant. The indictment charged conspiracy to commit armed robbery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (count 1); robbery of a postal employee by use of a dangerous weapon, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2114 (count 2); using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, namely, the robbery, <i>id.</i> &#167; 924(c)(1) (count 3); conspiracy to tamper with a witness, <i>id.</i> &#167; 371 (count 4); witness tampering by means of attempted murder, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1512(a)(1)(A) (count 5); using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, namely, the attempted murder, <i>id.</i> &#167; 924(c)(1) (count 6); obstruction of justice, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1503 (count 7); conspiracy to obstruct justice, <i>id.</i> &#167; 371 (count 8); and another incident of witness tampering by means of attempted murder, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1512(a)(1)(A) (count 9). Twenty days later, the government filed an amended information pursuant to the Three Strikes Law, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c), notifying the appellant that he was subject to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment based upon an array of previous convictions for \"serious violent felonies.\" The qualifying convictions, all obtained in the Massachusetts courts, included a 1981 conviction for armed robbery, a 1987 conviction for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon, three 1988 convictions for armed robbery, and a 1989 conviction for armed robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the commencement of trial, the district court severed counts 7 through 9 &#8212; a series of charges that revolved around an incident separate and apart from the robbery of the postal truck and the attempted murder of Donny DeSimone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Trial commenced on the first six counts on April 3, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the court, relying on Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), conditionally admitted third-party testimony anent two sets of statements allegedly made by Sutherland. Citing Fed.R.Evid. 403, the court later reversed its field and struck that testimony. In a separate ruling, the court denied the appellant's attempt, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3), to introduce evidence concerning other statements allegedly made by Sutherland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court gave the case to the jury on April 24, 2000. The next day, the foreman informed the judge that an extraneous document &#8212; an unredacted copy of a second superseding indictment containing the text of the three severed counts &#8212; had found its way into the jury room. After conducting a thorough investigation, the trial court dismissed one juror, denied the appellant's motion for a mistrial, and instructed the eleven remaining jurors to resume deliberations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On April 27, 2000, the jury found the appellant guilty on all six counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the appellant conceded the existence of the prior convictions enumerated in the amended information, but asserted that he could not constitutionally be sentenced to life imprisonment under the Three Strikes Law. The district court rejected these importunings and sentenced the appellant to four concurrent terms of life imprisonment on counts 1, 2, 4, and 5, to be followed by mandatory consecutive terms of five and twenty years, respectively, on counts 3 and 6. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We tackle the appellant's arguments in the order in which the underlying issues arose in the proceedings below. Thus, we begin with the evidentiary rulings and then address the appellant's principal claim: that the presence of a copy of the unredacted indictment in the jury room necessitated the declaration of a mistrial. Finally, we consider the appellant's assault on the constitutionality of the Three Strikes Law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide this aspect of our discussion into two segments, corresponding to the appellant's assignments of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Conditionally Admitted Coconspirator Hearsay Statements.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant maintains that the district court committed reversible error by initially admitting the DeSimones' testimony about two sets of statements allegedly made by Sutherland and then failing to declare a mistrial when it subsequently struck the conditionally admitted evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the witnesses, Sutherland and the appellant arrived at the DeSimones' apartment shortly after the robbery, boasted about their commission of the crime, and distributed a portion of the swag to the DeSimones. The government introduced testimony concerning the statements uttered while all four men were present, and the introduction of that evidence is not contested on appeal. After receiving his share of the proceeds, Ronny DeSimone left the apartment to purchase drugs. In Ronny's absence Sutherland and the appellant made several statements to Donny DeSimone involving the details of the robbery. The admission of this testimony is also uncontested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the subject of the assigned error. By the time that Ronny had returned to the apartment, the appellant had departed. Over objection, Ronny testified that Sutherland then related that he had been armed with a handgun, that he had forced the mail carrier to drive away from the bank, and that a brown station wagon had been used as the getaway car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of statements dates back to August of 1995 &#8212; a period during which both Sutherland and Donny DeSimone were incarcerated at the Plymouth House of Corrections. Over objection, Donny testified that Sutherland acknowledged knowing about the appellant's attempt to murder him, and, indeed, bragged about ordering the appellant to kill both of the DeSimone brothers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court provisionally admitted both sets of statements under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). That rule permits the introduction of a statement offered against a party if the statement is made \"by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" <i>Id.</i> The proponent of the statement bears the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, \"that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed, and that the declarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1180 (1st Cir.1993); <i>accord United States v. Petrozziello,</i> 548 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1977). If these conditions are met, and if there is corroboration in the form of extrinsic evidence of the declarant's involvement in the conspiracy, then the hearsay barrier is avoided and the statement may be admitted. <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1182.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has constructed a model for the handling of evidence proffered under Rule 801(d)(2)(E). That model authorizes the trial court to admit conditionally alleged coconspirator statements. <i>See United States v. Ciampaglia,</i> 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir.1980). At the close of all the evidence, the court then makes a final determination as to the admissibility of the evidence. <i>Id.</i> If the court ultimately concludes that the provisionally admitted evidence does not satisfy the applicable standard, it must \"give a cautionary instruction to the jury, or, upon an appropriate motion, declare a mistrial if the instruction will not suffice to cure any prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant launches a two-pronged attack against the trial court's treatment of the challenged statements. First, he argues that the foundational requirements for admissibility were not satisfied. Second, he asseverates that the contingent admission of the statements irretrievably poisoned the well, and that, when it became apparent that the evidence was not properly in the case, the trial court abused its discretion in eschewing a mistrial. We consider each foray separately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Foundational Requirements.</i> Although the parties expend considerable energy in disputing the correctness <i>vel non</i> of the district court's decision to admit the proffered testimony conditionally, we need not determine whether the court had an adequate foundational basis for doing so. After all, the court struck the testimony at the close of all the evidence and instructed the jurors to disregard it without telling them the rationale behind either its conditional admission or its ultimate exclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because the jury never learned about the court's specific determination that the statements met the foundational requirements of Rule 801(d)(2)(E), it stands to reason that the jury could not have been prejudiced by that determination. Accordingly, we turn without further ado to the appellant's contention that the district court improvidently denied his motion for a mistrial &#8212; a motion premised on the notion that the statements, once admitted, engendered irretrievable and unfair prejudice (notwithstanding the fact that the jury was subsequently instructed to disregard them).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Motion for Mistrial.</i> At the close of all the evidence, the trial court excluded the disputed statements pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 403 (which provides for the exclusion of relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury\"). In itself, this is a rather unconventional use of the <i>Ciampaglia</i> model. Typically, as <i>Ciampaglia</i> itself illustrates, 628 F.2d at 638, the district court will provisionally admit evidence offered under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), evaluate at the close of the evidence whether the government has proven the prerequisites for admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence, and strike the evidence if it has not. Here, however, the trial court explicitly concluded that the government had satisfied the requirements of Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), yet nonetheless struck the disputed evidence because of Rule 403 concerns. Although this was a somewhat unorthodox use of the Rule 801(d)(2)(E) model, we think that, as a theoretical matter, it was within the court's authority. <i>Cf. United States v. Van Nuys,</i> 707 F.Supp. 465, 468 (D.Colo.1989) (concluding, after trial, that a significant amount of testimony admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) should have been excluded pursuant to Rule 403).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the standard of review, all roads lead to Rome. We review a trial court's balancing under Rule 403 for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Marrero-Ortiz,</i> 160 F.3d 768, 774 (1st Cir.1998). We likewise review decisions to deny motions for mistrial for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir.1994). We discern no abuse here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court found that the challenged statements were tangential to the core conspiracies of robbery and attempted murder alleged in the indictment. Concerned that the unfairly prejudicial effect of the statements might outweigh their probative value, the court struck the evidence and instructed the jury to disregard it. The appellant argues that this palliative was insufficient because the court could not unring the bell &#8212; the evidence was so inflammatory that, once it was aired, no reasonable juror could be expected to disregard it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not a jury can be expected, under proper instructions, to disregard particular evidence is a judgment call, and one as to which appellate courts typically cede a high degree of deference to the trial court. <i>E.g., United States v. Freeman,</i> 208 F.3d 332, 344 (1st Cir.2000) (upholding district court's determination that curative instruction regarding evidence provisionally admitted but later stricken sufficiently shielded defendant from unfair prejudice). We do not think that the limits of that deference were tested here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the statements attributed to Sutherland were unhelpful to the appellant, but their content was not shocking when measured against the rough-and-tumble evidence properly admitted in the case. Moreover, it is routinely presumed that jurors will follow curative instructions and put aside matters that the trial court determines have been improperly admitted. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 740, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>United States v. Houlihan,</i> 92 F.3d 1271, 1287 (1st Cir.1996); <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1185. This presumption may be overcome only by showing that it is probable that: (1) responsible jurors will be unable to disregard the testimony; and (2) the testimony likely will have a seriously prejudicial effect on the aggrieved party. <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1185; <i>United States v. Paiva,</i> 892 F.2d 148, 160 (1st Cir.1989). This inquiry is not conducted in a vacuum, but, rather, calls for an assessment of the impact of the stricken evidence in light of all the other evidence presented in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sepulveda</i> illustrates the point. There, a police commander was permitted to testify as an expert witness over the defendant's objection. 15 F.3d at 1182. When cross-examination revealed that several of the opinions expressed by the witness lacked an adequate foundation, the defense moved midstream to strike the whole of the testimony. The trial court obliged. <i>Id.</i> at 1183. Even though the district judge instructed the jury to disregard the stricken testimony, the defendant moved for a mistrial on the ground that it had so prejudiced the jury that no curative instruction could put the genie back into the bottle. <i>Id.</i> at 1183-84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we upheld the trial court's denial of the motion. We did not find the stricken testimony to be so compelling that it threatened to sway the jury notwithstanding the court's explicit instructions to disregard it. <i>Id.</i> at 1185. In reaching this conclusion, we stressed that the cumulative nature of the stricken testimony completely undercut the defendants' plaint that the testimony carried the specter of lingering prejudice. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it is here. Both sets of statements were cumulative in nature. Sutherland's declarations to Ronny were largely duplicative of testimony offered by numerous witnesses and admitted without opposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Similarly, the central theme of the second set of statements &#8212; the plot to kill Donny &#8212; was fleshed out by a mass of evidence including, inter alia, the appellant's own admissions and the introduction of the gun that had malfunctioned. To cinch matters, the district court explicitly admonished the jury to disregard both sets of statements, and gave a clear, concise curative instruction to that effect. In these circumstances, the appellant has not successfully rebutted the presumption that the jury would follow the judge's instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this leg of our journey. We conclude, without serious question, that the lower court's refusal to grant the appellant's motion for a mistrial fell well within the wide encincture of its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Statements Against Penal Interest.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next calumnizes the district court's refusal to admit the testimony of two witnesses to the effect that Sutherland had stated (in two separate conversations) that he and Donny DeSimone had collogued to rob the robbers, that is, to steal the loot from the group that actually had hijacked the postal truck. The appellant proffered this testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3), which carves out a hearsay exception for, inter alia, \"[a] statement which ... at the time of its making ... so far tended to subject the declarant to ... criminal liability ... that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.\" <i>Id.</i> Such third-party testimony may only be admitted when the declarant is unavailable to testify. <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, an inculpatory statement \"tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused\" will not be admitted \"unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused to admit the testimony anent Sutherland's statements on two grounds, holding that the statements were not against Sutherland's penal interest and, in all events, were not sufficiently corroborated. We review the trial court's application of Rule 804(b)(3) for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Patrick,</i> 248 F.3d 11, 20, 23-24 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 620, 151 L.Ed.2d 542 (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The determination of whether a statement is against a declarant's penal interest depends on the outcome of a fact-intensive inquiry into the surrounding circumstances. <i>Williamson v. United States,</i> 512 U.S. 594, 603-04, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994); <i>United States v. Costa,</i> 31 F.3d 1073, 1077 (11th Cir.1994). Our review of the record compels the conclusion that the court below adequately evaluated the context in which the alleged statements were made. In the course of that endeavor, the court concluded that the tendered statements limned an alternative theory of the crime not pursued by the government, and represented a \"sophisticated and subtle\" effort by Sutherland and the appellant to avoid criminal responsibility on the precise charges lodged against them. On that basis, the court ruled that the statements were not against Sutherland's penal interest. That plausible rendition of the record was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, the district court's alternate ground for barring the statements is rock-solid. The court concluded that the corroborating evidence tendered by the appellant &#8212; that Sutherland allegedly told the same story to two different individuals on two separate occasions (hence, the two proffered statements) and that Donny DeSimone admitted at trial that he had told at least one other person that he had participated in the robbery &#8212; was insufficient to establish the trustworthiness of the statements. The strictures of Rule 804(b)(3) cannot be satisfied by a showing of speculative possibilities, but, rather, demand meaningful corroboration of proffered testimony. <i>See United States v. Mackey,</i> 117 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[T]he requirement for corroboration is not unrealistically severe but does go beyond minimal corroboration.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Measured by that yardstick, we cannot say that the district court's refusal to accept these minimally corroborative evidentiary fragments as sufficient indicia of trustworthiness constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. JURY TAINT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's cardinal claim is that the jurors' brief exposure to the text of the three severed counts necessitated a new trial. In approaching this claim, we first examine the appellant's assertion that the introduction of the unredacted indictment into the jury room, although accidental, triggered a presumption of prejudice. Rejecting that proposition, we proceed to assess the trial court's handling of the discovery that a deliberating jury had been exposed to information that carried the potential to do substantive damage. In the end, we conclude that the district court did not misuse its discretion in concluding that the jury's ability to render an impartial verdict remained intact (and that, therefore, the appellant's due process rights had not been infringed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Presumption of Prejudice.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's claim that the facts of this case demand a presumption of prejudice derives from the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Remmer v. United States,</i> 347 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654 (1954). There, as trial proceeded, a third party offered a bribe in exchange for a verdict favorable to the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 228, 74 S.Ct. 450. The solicited juror informed the trial judge about the attempted bribery. <i>Id.</i> Instead of informing defense counsel, the judge asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to look into the matter. <i>Id.</i> The jury found Remmer guilty. When he later learned about the attempted bribery, he moved unsuccessfully for a new trial. The court of appeals affirmed the district court's denial of this motion. 205 F.2d 277 (9th Cir.1953). The Supreme Court reversed, declaring that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a criminal case, any private communication, contact, or tampering directly or indirectly, with a juror during a trial about the matter pending before the jury is, for obvious reasons, deemed presumptively prejudicial.... The presumption is not conclusive, but the burden rests heavily upon the Government to establish, after notice to and hearing of the defendant, that such contact with the juror was harmless to the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">347 U.S. at 229, 74 S.Ct. 450.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the <i>Remmer</i> Court spoke in expansive terms, the Court's holding has been cabined by two subsequent decisions. In <i>Smith v. Phillips,</i> 455 U.S. 209, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982), a sitting juror submitted an application for employment as an investigator for the district attorney's office. <i>Id.</i> at 212, 102 S.Ct. 940. The district attorney revealed this information only after the jury on which the job-seeker sat had convicted the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 213, 102 S.Ct. 940. The trial court held a post-verdict hearing in which it determined that the pending application had not influenced the juror and denied the defendant's motion for a new trial. <i>Id.</i> at 213-14, 102 S.Ct. 940. The matter eventually reached the Supreme Court, which rejected the defendant's argument that the undisclosed application triggered <i>Remmer</i>'s rebuttable presumption of prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 217, 102 S.Ct. 940 (explaining that \"due process does not require a new trial every time a juror has been placed in a potentially compromising situation\"). The <i>Smith</i> Court then ruled that the hearing held by the trial court after the employment application had surfaced was sufficient under the circumstances. <i>See id.</i> at 217-18, 102 S.Ct. 940.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More recently, the Court declined to apply the <i>Remmer</i> presumption in a situation in which alternate jurors were present during jury deliberations. <i>See Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 737-39, 113 S.Ct. 1770. The Court held that the post-verdict inquiry into the facts, which showed that the irregularity had occurred but that the alternate jurors did not participate in the deliberations, afforded the defendant due process. <i>See id.</i> at 739-41, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court, too, has hesitated to apply the <i>Remmer</i> presumption indiscriminately. The leading case is U.<i>S. v. Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d 230 (1st Cir.1990). There, a magazine left fortuitously in the jury room contained an article suggesting that counsel for one of the defendants was the attorney of choice for \"[e]very troubled mobster\" in Boston. <i>Id.</i> at 258 &amp; n. 17. After guilty verdicts had been returned, the circulation of this literature in the jury room was brought to light. The district court held a comprehensive post-verdict hearing but found that the defendants' due process rights had not been infringed and denied their motions to set aside the verdict. We affirmed, rejecting a claim that the <i>Remmer</i> presumption applied. <i>Id.</i> at 260-62. We wrote:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he [<i>Remmer</i>] presumption is applicable only where there is an egregious tampering or third party communication which directly injects itself into the jury process. Put another way, the <i>Remmer</i> standard should be limited to cases of significant ex parte contacts with sitting jurors or those involving aggravated circumstances....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 261.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We built upon this foundation in <i>United States v. Gomes,</i> 177 F.3d 76 (1st Cir.1999). There, a juror at the defendant's second trial discovered a copy of the indictment that apparently had been left in the jury room after the first trial. <i>Id.</i> at 82. The indictment included, inter alia, a charge on which the defendant had been acquitted at the first trial. <i>Id.</i> The district court undertook an appropriate inquiry but refused to apply the <i>Remmer</i> presumption. We upheld that determination, noting that while other aggravating circumstances might justify the application of a <i>Remmer</i>-type presumption, such a presumption was unavailable here because <i>Remmer</i> involved deliberate misconduct attributable to a party and that, in all events, the <i>Gomes</i> jurors were not exposed to substantively damaging information. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the wake of <i>Smith</i> and <i>Olano,</i> one court has concluded that <i>Remmer</i> is a dead letter. <i>See United States v. Sylvester,</i> 143 F.3d 923, 934 (5th Cir.1998). Although we too have questioned <i>Remmer</i>'s continuing vitality, <i>see Gomes,</i> 177 F.3d at 83, we need not decide today whether, or to what extent, it remains good law. Here, as in <i>Boylan,</i> the facts simply do not warrant the application of a <i>Remmer</i> presumption. <i>Remmer</i> involved an apparent attempt deliberately to influence the outcome of the case through corrupt machinations. In contrast, the record here is reasonably clear that the presence of the unredacted indictment in the jury room was due to an inadvertent error by court personnel, and the appellant has not claimed that the document was insinuated into the jury room for some nefarious purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the <i>Remmer</i> Court was especially troubled by the trial court's decision to request an FBI investigation based on scanty information obtained during an ex parte meeting with the prosecution. <i>Remmer,</i> 347 U.S. at 228, 74 S.Ct. 450. That element, too, is missing from the instant case. Here, the trial judge kept all counsel apprised and engaged throughout his in-depth investigation into the matter, and diligently fleshed out the circumstances of the taint-producing incident. Given the absence of any egregious circumstances, we conclude that <i>Remmer</i> is inapposite and decline to apply it here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to keep <i>Remmer</i> in play, the appellant cites two cases previously decided by this court. The first such case, <i>United States v. Santana,</i> 175 F.3d 57 (1st Cir.1999), is clearly inapposite. That case turned on the trial court's decision to permit the jury to consider, <i>as evidence of guilt,</i> information &#8212; a view of the defendant's ears &#8212; presented to it for the first time during deliberations. <i>See id.</i> at 63-64. Here, unlike in <i>Santana,</i> the information that the jury improperly acquired during its deliberations (the unredacted indictment) was not received as evidence, and the court told the jury, in no uncertain terms, to disregard it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's reliance on <i>United States v. Maguire,</i> 918 F.2d 254 (1st Cir.1990), is similarly misplaced. There, the trial judge erroneously instructed the venire during jury empanelment about a count that had been severed. <i>See id.</i> at 266. The court denied the defendant's motion for a mistrial, but told the jury to disregard the reference to the severed count. <i>Id.</i> The jury convicted the defendant. We upheld the conviction, concluding that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Id.</i> at 266-68. Although the panel did observe, in dictum, that the \"reference to the severed count was presumptively prejudicial,\" <i>id.</i> at 267, we reject the appellant's effort to attach talismanic significance to that allusion. The panel neither cited <i>Remmer</i> nor conducted any analysis suggesting that it was undertaking a <i>Remmer</i>-based inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To conclude, we abjure any extension of the <i>Remmer</i> presumption to these facts. The appellant's claim of jury taint must be judged by more conventional standards. It is to that task that we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Merits of the Appellant's Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start this phase of our inquiry by revisiting certain generally applicable legal principles. We then describe the trial court's investigation into the possibility of jury taint, its findings, and its resolution of the matter. Finally, we evaluate the court's handling of the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Legal Landscape.</i> Where, as here, a colorable claim of jury taint surfaces during jury deliberations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the trial court has a duty to investigate the allegation promptly. <i>United States v. Hunnewell,</i> 891 F.2d 955, 961 (1st Cir.1989). The purpose of that inquiry is twofold: to ascertain whether some taint-producing event actually occurred, and if so, to assess the magnitude of the event and the extent of any resultant prejudice. <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 258. If the court finds both a taint-producing event and a significant potential for prejudice, the court must then consider the extent to which prophylactic measures (such as the discharge of particular jurors or the pronouncement of curative instructions) will suffice to alleviate that prejudice. <i>See Gomes,</i> 177 F.3d at 82. In some instances, a likelihood of residual prejudice may remain despite the court's best efforts. In that event, the court must grant a timely motion for a mistrial (if one is made). The objective of this painstaking process is to ensure that the parties \"receive[] the trial by an unbiased jury to which the Constitution entitles them.\" <i>United States v. Anello,</i> 765 F.2d 253, 258 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conducting an inquiry into a colorable question of jury taint is a delicate matter, and there is no pat procedure for such an inquiry. <i>Evans v. Young,</i> 854 F.2d 1081, 1083-84 (7th Cir.1988) (explaining that trial courts have wide discretion to evaluate pre-verdict claims of alleged jury misconduct as they deem appropriate); <i>Hunnewell,</i> 891 F.2d at 961 (stating that the trial court has \"considerable leeway\" in determining how to structure its investigation); <i>see also Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 258 (noting that \"the kaleidoscopic variety of possible problems counsels in favor of flexibility\"). Consequently, the trial court has wide discretion to fashion an appropriate procedure for assessing whether the jury has been exposed to substantively damaging information, and if so, whether cognizable prejudice is an inevitable and ineradicable concomitant of that exposure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Proceedings Below.</i> This brings us to the proceedings below. The introduction of an extraneous document into the jury room during deliberations is always a cause for concern. The intrusion was effected in this instance by an indictment &#8212; an official document bearing the government's imprimatur. That document contained three counts that were not before the jury, and those counts charged the appellant with serious malefactions (of which the jury had no other knowledge). Thus, the acknowledged presence of the unredacted indictment in the jury room gave rise to a colorable claim of actual prejudice and posed a significant threat to the jurors' ability to render an impartial verdict. The question, then, reduces to whether the trial court investigated the claim appropriately and resolved it in a satisfactory manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court recognized these realities. Upon learning that the unredacted indictment had infiltrated the jury room, the court immediately alerted counsel and solicited suggestions about the most advisable way to handle the situation. Adopting defense counsel's recommendation, the court assembled the jurors, informed them of the need for an inquiry, and instructed them not to discuss the matter amongst themselves. The court then proceeded to interview the jurors one by one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the individual voir dire examinations revealed some slight discrepancies in the jurors' accounts concerning their exposure to the text of the unredacted indictment, the differences are not material here. For the most part, a consistent picture emerged. The jurors agreed that, at the start of the second day of deliberations, one of their number noticed a copy of the indictment that contained some \"extra\" counts. He mentioned this oddity to his fellow venirepersons, and, at the urging of some of them, read aloud the text of count 7 (an obstruction of justice charge). After a brief discussion, the jurors concluded that the document did not belong in the jury room, and the jury foreman brought it to the court security officer. He told the officer that: \"We found this document in the group of materials and it doesn't seem to belong there. It has more counts than are in the verdict slip.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After concluding this initial round of voir dire examinations, the trial court made the following finding (out of the jurors' earshot):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are inconsistencies among the recollections.... None of them seem to be material. There is a core quality to this: First, a recognition that there was something unusual; second, a recognition that there was something that was not properly before them; number three, their recognition that they should put it out of their deliberations, certain facts and circumstances.... In fact, they responded &#8212; from my perspective &#8212; precisely the way jurors are supposed to respond ... if they were exposed to extraneous information, including bringing it to my attention....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then reassembled the jurors, instructed them that it was their duty to decide the case based on their \"evaluation only of the evidence that's presented to you here in trial and not by consideration of other extraneous matters,\" and launched into a strongly-worded curative instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> At that juncture, the court undertook a second round of individual voir dire examinations, this time focusing on each individual juror's ability to \"put out of [his or her] mind[] entirely the facts and circumstances of the extraneous document\" so that he or she might decide the case solely on the evidence introduced at trial. Eleven of the twelve jurors expressed confidence that they could function in that pristine fashion and satisfied the court of their ability to do so. Without objection, the court dismissed the lone dissenter. After rejecting the appellant's challenges to three additional jurors, the judge directed the remaining jurors to resume deliberations with a view toward reaching a verdict. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Adequacy of the Trial Court's Handiwork.</i> We now test the trial court's handiwork against the abuse-of-discretion benchmark. <i>See Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 262; <i>Hunnewell,</i> 891 F.2d at 961. In this context, however, review for abuse of discretion connotes a certain rigor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we use the term, the abuse-of-discretion standard encompasses multiple layers of inquiry. <i>See Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 98-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). Under it, we accept the trial court's factual findings only to the extent that they are not clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Castro,</i> 129 F.3d 226, 229 (1st Cir.1997). We next examine the legal principles on which the court premised its decision, mindful that an error of law invariably constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena,</i> 138 F.3d 442, 444 (1st Cir.1998). This particular inquiry is conducted without any special deference to the trial court's views, <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir.1998), and extends to the court's application of the law to the facts as found. Only then do we ask whether, given the totality of the circumstances then and there obtaining, the sum of the trial court's acts and omissions constituted a misuse of its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting from this vantage point, we turn first to the procedure employed below. For all practical purposes, the lower court replicated the <i>Boylan</i> model &#8212; a model that we previously have deemed \"methodologically sound.\" 898 F.2d at 259. The court engaged counsel for both sides in an ongoing dialogue about the most appropriate way in which to handle the needed investigation, examined each juror twice, and pursued no fewer than eight lines of questioning proposed by defense counsel. The court's probing into the extent of the jurors' exposure to the extraneous information and its potential impact on their ability to render an impartial verdict was thorough and incisive. The court gave the jury clear and emphatic curative instructions. Last &#8212; but surely not least &#8212; the court made explicit findings that are amply rooted in the transcript of the two rounds of voir dire examinations and that make considerable sense when scrutinized against the record of the trial as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant raises two specific objections to the trial court's findings. First, the appellant takes aim at a statement made by a retained juror during the second round of questioning. When pressed by the judge to expound upon his comment that \"the gravity of the discussion weighs some,\" the juror responded that: \"I believe that the outcome of the trial and the verdict turns on the very unexpected and serious change in the evidence presented.\" Considered in isolation, that comment might raise a reader's eyebrow &#8212; but the colloquy that ensued between the judge and the juror makes manifest that the juror's remark was not a cause for concern. In that colloquy, the juror assured the judge that he would not consider the extraneous material and characterized his earlier statement as \"a poor choice of words.\" Viewed in that light, we do not believe that the court's decision to retain the juror constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the appellant argues that the court's finding that the incident yielded no residuum of unfair prejudice failed to take into account that the jury's exposure to the severed counts undermined his principal trial strategy. In this regard, defense counsel credibly claimed that she had made a conscious decision to avoid any reference to the Niditch incident (which comprised the subject matter of the three severed counts, <i>see supra</i> note 1) in order to preclude \"opening the door\" to the government's introduction of \"highly charged\" evidence related to that topic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this argument is that the inadvertent exposure of the jury to the unredacted indictment did not lead to the introduction of any <i>evidence</i> concerning the Niditch incident, and the court found as a fact that the retained jurors were fully able to put aside their brief encounter with the allegations contained in the severed counts. The fact that the exposure was to an indictment, rather than to information of evidentiary quality, weighs in the government's favor. Before deliberations commenced (and, thus, before any exposure to the extraneous information occurred), the court had clearly explained that \"[t]he indictment is the document that frames the issues, the charges, the criminal violations that the Government believes it can prove. But ... the indictment isn't evidence.... It's simply the document that you look to to understand what it is that the Government is undertaking to prove in this case.\" The court reinforced this instruction by telling the jurors, after the unredacted indictment surfaced, to \"[p]ut entirely out of your mind any exposure any of you may have had to earlier forms of the kinds of charges the Government was thinking about here.\" Appellate courts ordinarily presume that a jury will follow the trial judge's specific instructions in a criminal case, <i>e.g., Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 740, 113 S.Ct. 1770; <i>Houlihan,</i> 92 F.3d at 1287; <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1185, and there is no reason to abandon that presumption here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record reflects that the lower court handled its investigation into the \"jury taint\" question with consummate care. Its detailed findings and its conclusion that the jurors' accidental exposure to the unredacted indictment caused no ineradicable prejudice are fully supportable. In words that resonate here, the <i>Smith</i> Court observed that \"[d]ue process means a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it, and a trial judge ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen.\" 455 U.S. at 217, 102 S.Ct. 940. The court below carried out this mandate to the letter. Consequently, we hold that the court acted well within the scope of its discretion in structuring the inquiry into the question of jury taint, in excusing a single juror, and in concluding that the remaining jurors' ability to render an impartial verdict had not been compromised.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The appellant received all the process that was due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE THREE STRIKES LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court invoked the Three Strikes Law, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c), to sentence the appellant to multiple terms of life imprisonment. The appellant challenges that determination on constitutional grounds. Before addressing this challenge, we describe the statutory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Three Strikes Law is of relatively recent vintage. It dictates mandatory life imprisonment for any person convicted in a federal court of a \"serious violent felony\" if, inter alia, that person has been convicted on two or more prior occasions of \"serious violent felonies.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3559(c)(1)(A)(i). The statute characterizes various federal and state offenses as serious violent felonies. It places three federal robbery statutes in this category, and, pertinently, adds a generic definition that encompasses:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny other offense punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 3559(c)(2)(F)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Three Strikes Law also includes a disqualification provision that offers a criminal defendant the opportunity to remove some crimes that otherwise would qualify as serious violent felonies (and, therefore, count as \"strikes\") from the \"three strikes\" calculation. The disqualification provision states, in relevant part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) Robbery, an attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit robbery ... shall not serve as a basis for sentencing under this subsection if the defendant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) no firearm or other dangerous weapon was used in the offense and no threat of use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon was involved in the offense; and (ii) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury ... to any person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 3559(c)(3)(A)(i)-(ii). The disqualification provision places the burden of proof squarely on the defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence that, notwithstanding the government's allegations, his prior felony convictions do not constitute qualifying offenses. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant does not quarrel with the district court's finding that, on their face, the six prior convictions catalogued by the government constitute \"strikes\" under the Three Strikes Law. He does, however, advance two arguments that implicate the law's constitutionality. We consider these arguments sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Apprendi.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contests the power of the court to take the prior convictions into account, noting that they had neither been referenced in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, his thesis runs, the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), prohibits the imposition of an enhanced sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is a non-starter. The core holding of <i>Apprendi</i> is that \"[<i>o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,</i> any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (emphasis supplied). We think the Court meant exactly that &#8212; and we have said so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recently considered and rejected a materially indistinguishable argument in <i>United States v. Gomez-Estrada,</i> 273 F.3d 400, 401 (1st Cir.2001). We noted there that the <i>Apprendi</i> Court explicitly exempted sentence-enhancement provisions based upon prior criminal convictions from the scope of its holding. <i>Id.</i> at 402 (citing <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348); <i>see also Almendarez-Torres v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 247, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (upholding Congress's decision to treat prior convictions as a sentencing factor rather than an element of a federal criminal offense). Because we have ruled unequivocally that the strictures of <i>Apprendi</i> do not apply to sentence-enhancement provisions based upon prior criminal convictions, <i>see Gomez-Estrada,</i> 273 F.3d at 401-02; <i>United States v. Terry,</i> 240 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 532 U.S. 1023, 121 S.Ct. 1965, 149 L.Ed.2d 759 (2001), we reject the appellant's <i>Apprendi</i>-based challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Shifting of the Burden of Proof.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's second argument is more sophisticated. He says that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c)(3)(A) violates constitutional due process guarantees because it shifts the burden of proof to the defendant and requires him to establish by \"clear and convincing\" evidence that his prior convictions are nonqualifying (and, hence, not countable as \"strikes\" under the Three Strikes Law). Refined to bare essence, the appellant's thesis is that the disqualification provision violates due process in two related ways: (1) by requiring the defendant to prove that previous offenses are nonqualifying, and (2) by requiring that he do so under a heightened standard. These constitutional claims engender de novo review. <i>United States v. Zorrilla,</i> 93 F.3d 7, 8 (1st Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Gifford,</i> 17 F.3d 462, 471-72 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our starting point is the Court's decision in <i>Patterson v. New York,</i> 432 U.S. 197, 97 S.Ct. 2319, 53 L.Ed.2d 281 (1977). There, the defendant challenged a New York law that permitted a person accused of murder to invoke the affirmative defense of \"extreme emotional disturbance\" to mitigate the charged crime to manslaughter. <i>Id.</i> at 198-99 &amp; nn.2-3, 97 S.Ct. 2319. The New York criminal code assigned to the defendant the burden of establishing the \"extreme emotional disturbance\" defense by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>Id.</i> at 200, 97 S.Ct. 2319. The defendant failed in his effort to mitigate the charge against him, and appealed his murder conviction on the ground that the burden-shifting component contravened due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noting that it was well within the state's power to criminalize intentional killings and mete out substantial punishment to individuals convicted of such crimes, the Supreme Court emphasized that, incident thereto, the state had the power to recognize factors that mitigated the degree of criminality or punishment. <i>Id.</i> at 209, 97 S.Ct. 2319. As a logical consequence, the state was entitled to \"assure itself that the [mitigating] fact has been established with reasonable certainty\" by requiring the defendant to prove such a fact by a preponderance of the evidence. <i>Id.</i> Thus, as long as the state has proven all elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, its reallocation of the burden of proof in an affirmative defense did not violate due process. <i>See id.</i> at 205-06, 97 S.Ct. 2319.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whereas Patterson raised his affirmative defense at trial, the Three Strikes Law comes into play at the sentencing stage of a criminal proceeding. But this is a distinction without a difference: the sentencing process is surely no more exacting than the process of establishing guilt. It therefore stands to reason that <i>Patterson</i> applies with equal force to burden-shifting affirmative defenses made available at the sentencing stage of criminal proceedings &#8212; and that such a paradigm does not offend the Constitution. <i>Accord United States v. Wicks,</i> 132 F.3d 383, 389 (7th Cir.1997) (\"If <i>Patterson</i> allows such a result even at the stage of the trial where guilt or innocence is decided, it follows that due process does not prohibit the kind of affirmative defense at the sentencing stage found in &#167; 3559(c)(3)(A).\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An equally germane consideration is that antecedent \"strikes\" that factor into the Three Strikes calculation take the form of prior convictions. The Supreme Court has upheld a state sentence enhancement provision requiring a recidivist defendant to shoulder the burden of proof of establishing the invalidity of prior convictions. <i>Parke v. Raley,</i> 506 U.S. 20, 34, 113 S.Ct. 517, 121 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992). The Court reasoned that the \"`presumption of regularity' that attaches to final judgments\" made it appropriate to assign a proof burden to the defendant. <i>Id.</i> at 29, 113 S.Ct. 517. Like the contested state statute in <i>Parke,</i> the Three Strikes Law initially presumes that prior convictions falling under one of the statutorily enumerated definitions are valid, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c)(1)-(2), and then provides the defendant with the opportunity to disqualify the convictions, <i>id.</i> &#167; 3559(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken together, <i>Patterson</i> and <i>Parke</i> convince us that a paradigm that allows the defendant to raise an affirmative defense during the sentencing phase of criminal proceedings, but then shifts the burden of proof to him to establish the defense, does not violate due process. Nor is this an eccentric view of the law: several other courts have reached this same conclusion. <i>See United States v. Gatewood,</i> 230 F.3d 186, 189-90 (6th Cir.2000) (en banc), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 911, 151 L.Ed.2d 878 (2002) (Jan. 14, 2002); <i>United States v.

Kaluna,</i> 192 F.3d 1188, 1196 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc); <i>Wicks,</i> 132 F.3d at 389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's related asseveration is that section 3559(c)(3)(A)'s placement of a heightened evidentiary burden on criminal defendants &#8212; clear and convincing evidence &#8212; contravenes their right to due process.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> This asseveration also lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is transparently clear that Congress had the power to enact a law that mandated life imprisonment for recidivist felons who committed a series of serious violent felonies or drug offenses. Although it was not constitutionally required to do so, Congress thought it efficacious to include a provision that exempted a particular subset of offenses from consideration as \"strikes.\" Given that Congress was under no obligation to provide defendants with such a dispensation in the first place, there is no principled reason why Congress could not craft such a provision in the manner that it deemed appropriate. <i>See Gatewood,</i> 230 F.3d at 191. As the Sixth Circuit astutely observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Congress can choose whether or not to provide a defense, it follows that the burden of proof Congress places on such a defense cannot be unconstitutional.... It is the prerogative of the legislative branch to determine whether a recidivist defendant is subject to an enhanced statutory punishment and what, if any, affirmative defense applies after a defendant has previously been adjudged guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant avers that <i>Cooper v. Oklahoma,</i> 517 U.S. 348, 116 S.Ct. 1373, 134 L.Ed.2d 498 (1996), compels a different conclusion. We do not agree. <i>Cooper</i> involved a constitutional challenge to an Oklahoma law that presumed a criminal defendant competent to stand trial unless she mustered clear and convincing proof of her incompetence. <i>Id.</i> at 350, 116 S.Ct. 1373. A unanimous Supreme Court struck down the law on the ground that the heightened evidentiary standard violated due process. <i>Id.</i> at 369, 116 S.Ct. 1373. Starting with the bedrock principle that the state can try only a competent criminal defendant, the Court ruled that this principle trumped the state's interest in ensuring the efficient operation of its criminal justice system through the application of a heightened standard of proof. <i>Id.</i> at 367, 116 S.Ct. 1373.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The competency statute that the <i>Cooper</i> Court annulled is clearly distinguishable from the disqualification provision in the Three Strikes Law. The crux of the matter is that a criminal defendant has a fundamental constitutional right not to be forced to stand trial while incompetent &#8212; but he has no comparable right to a statutorily created affirmative defense. <i>See Gatewood,</i> 230 F.3d at 191 (\"There is no fundamental constitutional right to avoid an enhanced sentence based on prior convictions simply because the prior convictions were nonviolent.\"). The <i>Cooper</i> Court drove home that precise point by expressly distinguishing the Oklahoma competency provision from the statutorily created affirmative defense addressed and approved in <i>Patterson. See Cooper,</i> 517 U.S. at 367-68, 116 S.Ct. 1373 (\"Unlike <i>Patterson,</i> which concerned procedures for providing a statutory defense, we consider here whether a State's procedures for guaranteeing a fundamental constitutional right are sufficiently protective of that right.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That gets the grease from the goose. Since the disqualification provision in the Three Strikes Law is functionally equivalent to the statutory affirmative defense discussed in <i>Patterson,</i> the holding in <i>Cooper</i> is inapposite here. It follows inexorably that the burden placed upon criminal defendants to establish by clear and convincing evidence that their prior convictions are nonqualifying offenses pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c)(3) is not incompatible with due process. <i>Accord Gatewood,</i> 230 F.3d at 191; <i>Ferguson,</i> 211 F.3d at 887.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.

Although the appellant insists that the district court ought to have declared a mistrial because of jury taint, <i>see infra</i> Part III, he does not challenge the verdict on the ground that it was returned by a jury of fewer than twelve.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The court merely told the jury that \"[t]he reasons [for striking the evidence] are several-fold and I don't think I really need to get into them too deeply, except to say that the evidence seems to me to be far too attenuated for you to look to it or rely upon it.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> For example, Donny testified that, on the day of the robbery, Sutherland and the appellant collectively related details of the crime that were nearly identical to those that Sutherland trumpeted after the appellant had left the apartment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We leave for another day the question of whether a jury's exposure to substantively damaging information may sometimes occur under circumstances so aggravated as to warrant the application of the<i>Remmer</i> presumption even without deliberate misconduct (and if so, what those circumstances might comprise). That question simply is not presented here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The case at bar involves a trial court's<i>pre-verdict</i> handling of an allegation that a deliberating jury was accidentally exposed to substantively damaging information. The timing of the court's inquiry distinguishes it from the vast majority of the reported cases, most of which deal with claims of jury taint raised <i>after</i> the jury has returned a verdict. <i>E.g., Smith,</i> 455 U.S. at 213-14, 102 S.Ct. 940; <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 262. In that situation, appellate courts frequently have framed the inquiry in terms of harmless error, asking, in effect, whether the trial court's determination that an improper outside influence did not taint the jury verdict was supportable. Where the claim of jury taint surfaces before the jury has completed its deliberations, the harmless-error test is a poor fit (and, therefore, of scant utility).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The court stated in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[T]hroughout, I've been telling you that you decide this case solely on the basis of evidence that's actually presented to you....

But those cases involved the jury's consideration of information of evidentiary quality, and the claim of jury taint arose after trial (when any harm could not be undone). Here, however, the harmless-error test is a poor fit. <i>See supra</i> note 6. The matter came to the trial judge's attention before the jury reached a verdict, and the judge, after due investigation, gave a timely curative instruction. Furthermore, the information to which the jury was exposed was not evidence; the retained jurors warranted that they would not consider it; and they added that, in all events, what they had seen or heard would not influence their judgment.

It is the response to the error that counts.\" Elaine Partnow, <i>The Quotable Woman: 1800-1981</i> 453 (1983). Defendant-appellant Joseph Bradshaw, a recidivist robber, would have done well to heed the message inherent in these words of wisdom. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the court below, the government charged that the appellant repeated and compounded the error of his ways. A jury agreed, convicting him on an array of charges, including armed robbery and attempted murder. Invoking the \"Three Strikes Law,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c), the district court sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment. In this appeal, Bradshaw &#8212; vigorously represented by able counsel &#8212; raises a substantial claim of jury taint. He also challenges various evidentiary rulings and the constitutionality of the Three Strikes Law. Although the government has offered us surprisingly little help, our perscrutation of the record and the case law persuades us that the conviction and sentence must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recount the relevant facts as the jury might have found them, consistent with record support. In that exercise, we paint with a broad brush, reserving more extensive detail for our ensuing discussion of the appellant's specific claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The charges against the appellant stem from separate, but related, incidents. Our chronological narrative begins in the spring of 1995, at which time the appellant's circle of friends included Thomas Sutherland and the DeSimone brothers, Ronald and Donald (colloquially known as \"Ronny\" and \"Donny\"). Ronny DeSimone told the appellant that, five mornings a week, a mail carrier transported large sums of money from the Lynn, Massachusetts post office to a nearby financial institution. The two men repaired to Lynn and scouted the layout of the bank. The appellant thereafter described the situation to Sutherland, telling him that Ronny DeSimone had stumbled upon \"a good score.\" The pair decided to rob the mail carrier and reward Ronny by giving him ten percent of the take.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sutherland and the appellant executed the robbery on June 5, 1995. When the mail carrier, Timothy Bogart, drove up to the bank, Sutherland commandeered the postal truck and ordered Bogart, at gunpoint, to drive away. After Bogart had gone a few blocks, Sutherland directed him to stop. Sutherland then snatched a mail tub containing more than $122,000 in cash and checks that had been sent by registered mail, and joined the appellant (who was waiting nearby in a rented station wagon). The men departed in haste.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that same month, Sutherland and the appellant came to suspect that the DeSimone brothers were cooperating in the investigation of the robbery. They decided that Donny DeSimone had to be killed. The appellant recruited Paul Courteau to assist in this grisly business.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 12, 1995, Courteau and the appellant, employing a pretext, inveigled Donny DeSimone into accompanying them on a ride. The trio drove to various locations, eventually winding up at an unoccupied baseball field. There, the appellant pulled out a handgun and attempted to test-fire it. The gun jammed. Nonplussed, he herded his companions back into the car and the three men continued their meanderings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early hours of the morning, they drove to a wooded area. Courteau and the appellant exited the vehicle, told Donny to stay put, and walked into the woods. A few moments later, Donny heard a gunshot. When the others returned, the appellant pointed the gun at Donny and ordered him out of the vehicle. Charging that Donny was \"cooperating with the feds,\" the appellant forced him to his knees, handed the gun to Courteau, and instructed Courteau to shoot. Courteau pulled the trigger, but the gun jammed once again. Donny lost little time in fleeing from the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 8, 1998, a federal grand jury returned a nine-count indictment against the appellant. The indictment charged conspiracy to commit armed robbery, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 (count 1); robbery of a postal employee by use of a dangerous weapon, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2114 (count 2); using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, namely, the robbery, <i>id.</i> &#167; 924(c)(1) (count 3); conspiracy to tamper with a witness, <i>id.</i> &#167; 371 (count 4); witness tampering by means of attempted murder, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1512(a)(1)(A) (count 5); using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, namely, the attempted murder, <i>id.</i> &#167; 924(c)(1) (count 6); obstruction of justice, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1503 (count 7); conspiracy to obstruct justice, <i>id.</i> &#167; 371 (count 8); and another incident of witness tampering by means of attempted murder, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1512(a)(1)(A) (count 9). Twenty days later, the government filed an amended information pursuant to the Three Strikes Law, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c), notifying the appellant that he was subject to a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment based upon an array of previous convictions for \"serious violent felonies.\" The qualifying convictions, all obtained in the Massachusetts courts, included a 1981 conviction for armed robbery, a 1987 conviction for robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon, three 1988 convictions for armed robbery, and a 1989 conviction for armed robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the commencement of trial, the district court severed counts 7 through 9 &#8212; a series of charges that revolved around an incident separate and apart from the robbery of the postal truck and the attempted murder of Donny DeSimone.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Trial commenced on the first six counts on April 3, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the court, relying on Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), conditionally admitted third-party testimony anent two sets of statements allegedly made by Sutherland. Citing Fed.R.Evid. 403, the court later reversed its field and struck that testimony. In a separate ruling, the court denied the appellant's attempt, pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3), to introduce evidence concerning other statements allegedly made by Sutherland.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court gave the case to the jury on April 24, 2000. The next day, the foreman informed the judge that an extraneous document &#8212; an unredacted copy of a second superseding indictment containing the text of the three severed counts &#8212; had found its way into the jury room. After conducting a thorough investigation, the trial court dismissed one juror, denied the appellant's motion for a mistrial, and instructed the eleven remaining jurors to resume deliberations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On April 27, 2000, the jury found the appellant guilty on all six counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the appellant conceded the existence of the prior convictions enumerated in the amended information, but asserted that he could not constitutionally be sentenced to life imprisonment under the Three Strikes Law. The district court rejected these importunings and sentenced the appellant to four concurrent terms of life imprisonment on counts 1, 2, 4, and 5, to be followed by mandatory consecutive terms of five and twenty years, respectively, on counts 3 and 6. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We tackle the appellant's arguments in the order in which the underlying issues arose in the proceedings below. Thus, we begin with the evidentiary rulings and then address the appellant's principal claim: that the presence of a copy of the unredacted indictment in the jury room necessitated the declaration of a mistrial. Finally, we consider the appellant's assault on the constitutionality of the Three Strikes Law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide this aspect of our discussion into two segments, corresponding to the appellant's assignments of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Conditionally Admitted Coconspirator Hearsay Statements.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant maintains that the district court committed reversible error by initially admitting the DeSimones' testimony about two sets of statements allegedly made by Sutherland and then failing to declare a mistrial when it subsequently struck the conditionally admitted evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the witnesses, Sutherland and the appellant arrived at the DeSimones' apartment shortly after the robbery, boasted about their commission of the crime, and distributed a portion of the swag to the DeSimones. The government introduced testimony concerning the statements uttered while all four men were present, and the introduction of that evidence is not contested on appeal. After receiving his share of the proceeds, Ronny DeSimone left the apartment to purchase drugs. In Ronny's absence Sutherland and the appellant made several statements to Donny DeSimone involving the details of the robbery. The admission of this testimony is also uncontested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the subject of the assigned error. By the time that Ronny had returned to the apartment, the appellant had departed. Over objection, Ronny testified that Sutherland then related that he had been armed with a handgun, that he had forced the mail carrier to drive away from the bank, and that a brown station wagon had been used as the getaway car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second set of statements dates back to August of 1995 &#8212; a period during which both Sutherland and Donny DeSimone were incarcerated at the Plymouth House of Corrections. Over objection, Donny testified that Sutherland acknowledged knowing about the appellant's attempt to murder him, and, indeed, bragged about ordering the appellant to kill both of the DeSimone brothers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court provisionally admitted both sets of statements under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). That rule permits the introduction of a statement offered against a party if the statement is made \"by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" <i>Id.</i> The proponent of the statement bears the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, \"that a conspiracy embracing both the declarant and the defendant existed, and that the declarant uttered the statement during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\" <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1180 (1st Cir.1993); <i>accord United States v.

If these conditions are met, and if there is corroboration in the form of extrinsic evidence of the declarant's involvement in the conspiracy, then the hearsay barrier is avoided and the statement may be admitted. <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1182.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has constructed a model for the handling of evidence proffered under Rule 801(d)(2)(E). That model authorizes the trial court to admit conditionally alleged coconspirator statements. <i>See United States v. Ciampaglia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381348\"><a href=\"/opinion/381348/united-states-v-paul-ciampaglia-united-states-of-america-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span>, 638 (1st Cir.1980). At the close of all the evidence, the court then makes a final determination as to the admissibility of the evidence. <i>Id.</i> If the court ultimately concludes that the provisionally admitted evidence does not satisfy the applicable standard, it must \"give a cautionary instruction to the jury, or, upon an appropriate motion, declare a mistrial if the instruction will not suffice to cure any prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant launches a two-pronged attack against the trial court's treatment of the challenged statements. First, he argues that the foundational requirements for admissibility were not satisfied. Second, he asseverates that the contingent admission of the statements irretrievably poisoned the well, and that, when it became apparent that the evidence was not properly in the case, the trial court abused its discretion in eschewing a mistrial.

After all, the court struck the testimony at the close of all the evidence and instructed the jurors to disregard it without telling them the rationale behind either its conditional admission or its ultimate exclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Because the jury never learned about the court's specific determination that the statements met the foundational requirements of Rule 801(d)(2)(E), it stands to reason that the jury could not have been prejudiced by that determination. Accordingly, we turn without further ado to the appellant's contention that the district court improvidently denied his motion for a mistrial &#8212; a motion premised on the notion that the statements, once admitted, engendered irretrievable and unfair prejudice (notwithstanding the fact that the jury was subsequently instructed to disregard them).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Motion for Mistrial.</i> At the close of all the evidence, the trial court excluded the disputed statements pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 403 (which provides for the exclusion of relevant evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury\"). In itself, this is a rather unconventional use of the <i>Ciampaglia</i> model. Typically, as <i>Ciampaglia</i> itself illustrates, 628 F.2d at 638, the district court will provisionally admit evidence offered under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), evaluate at the close of the evidence whether the government has proven the prerequisites for admissibility by a preponderance of the evidence, and strike the evidence if it has not. Here, however, the trial court explicitly concluded that the government had satisfied the requirements of Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), yet nonetheless struck the disputed evidence because of Rule 403 concerns. Although this was a somewhat unorthodox use of the Rule 801(d)(2)(E) model, we think that, as a theoretical matter, it was within the court's authority. <i>Cf. United States v. Van Nuys,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></span>, 468 (D.Colo.1989) (concluding, after trial, that a significant amount of testimony admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) should have been excluded pursuant to Rule 403).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the standard of review, all roads lead to Rome.

We discern no abuse here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court found that the challenged statements were tangential to the core conspiracies of robbery and attempted murder alleged in the indictment. Concerned that the unfairly prejudicial effect of the statements might outweigh their probative value, the court struck the evidence and instructed the jury to disregard it. The appellant argues that this palliative was insufficient because the court could not unring the bell &#8212; the evidence was so inflammatory that, once it was aired, no reasonable juror could be expected to disregard it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not a jury can be expected, under proper instructions, to disregard particular evidence is a judgment call, and one as to which appellate courts typically cede a high degree of deference to the trial court. <i>E.g., United States v. Freeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198886\"><a href=\"/opinion/198886/united-states-v-freeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span>, 344 (1st Cir.2000) (upholding district court's determination that curative instruction regarding evidence provisionally admitted but later stricken sufficiently shielded defendant from unfair prejudice).

Moreover, it is routinely presumed that jurors will follow curative instructions and put aside matters that the trial court determines have been improperly admitted. <i>United States v.

This presumption may be overcome only by showing that it is probable that: (1) responsible jurors will be unable to disregard the testimony; and (2) the testimony likely will have a seriously prejudicial effect on the aggrieved party. <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1185; <i>United States v. Paiva,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534182\"><a href=\"/opinion/534182/united-states-v-james-earl-paiva/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 160 (1st Cir.1989). This inquiry is not conducted in a vacuum, but, rather, calls for an assessment of the impact of the stricken evidence in light of all the other evidence presented in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Sepulveda</i> illustrates the point. There, a police commander was permitted to testify as an expert witness over the defendant's objection. 15 F.3d at 1182. When cross-examination revealed that several of the opinions expressed by the witness lacked an adequate foundation, the defense moved midstream to strike the whole of the testimony. The trial court obliged. <i>Id.</i> at 1183. Even though the district judge instructed the jury to disregard the stricken testimony, the defendant moved for a mistrial on the ground that it had so prejudiced the jury that no curative instruction could put the genie back into the bottle. <i>Id.</i> at 1183-84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, we upheld the trial court's denial of the motion. We did not find the stricken testimony to be so compelling that it threatened to sway the jury notwithstanding the court's explicit instructions to disregard it. <i>Id.</i> at 1185. In reaching this conclusion, we stressed that the cumulative nature of the stricken testimony completely undercut the defendants' plaint that the testimony carried the specter of lingering prejudice. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So it is here. Both sets of statements were cumulative in nature. Sutherland's declarations to Ronny were largely duplicative of testimony offered by numerous witnesses and admitted without opposition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Similarly, the central theme of the second set of statements &#8212; the plot to kill Donny &#8212; was fleshed out by a mass of evidence including, inter alia, the appellant's own admissions and the introduction of the gun that had malfunctioned. To cinch matters, the district court explicitly admonished the jury to disregard both sets of statements, and gave a clear, concise curative instruction to that effect. In these circumstances, the appellant has not successfully rebutted the presumption that the jury would follow the judge's instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this leg of our journey. We conclude, without serious question, that the lower court's refusal to grant the appellant's motion for a mistrial fell well within the wide encincture of its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Statements Against Penal Interest.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant next calumnizes the district court's refusal to admit the testimony of two witnesses to the effect that Sutherland had stated (in two separate conversations) that he and Donny DeSimone had collogued to rob the robbers, that is, to steal the loot from the group that actually had hijacked the postal truck. The appellant proffered this testimony under Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(3), which carves out a hearsay exception for, inter alia, \"[a] statement which ... at the time of its making ... so far tended to subject the declarant to ... criminal liability ... that a reasonable person in the declarant's position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.\" <i>Id.</i> Such third-party testimony may only be admitted when the declarant is unavailable to testify. <i>Id.</i> Furthermore, an inculpatory statement \"tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused\" will not be admitted \"unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court refused to admit the testimony anent Sutherland's statements on two grounds, holding that the statements were not against Sutherland's penal interest and, in all events, were not sufficiently corroborated. We review the trial court's application of Rule 804(b)(3) for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v.

Our review of the record compels the conclusion that the court below adequately evaluated the context in which the alleged statements were made. In the course of that endeavor, the court concluded that the tendered statements limned an alternative theory of the crime not pursued by the government, and represented a \"sophisticated and subtle\" effort by Sutherland and the appellant to avoid criminal responsibility on the precise charges lodged against them. On that basis, the court ruled that the statements were not against Sutherland's penal interest. That plausible rendition of the record was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, the district court's alternate ground for barring the statements is rock-solid. The court concluded that the corroborating evidence tendered by the appellant &#8212; that Sutherland allegedly told the same story to two different individuals on two separate occasions (hence, the two proffered statements) and that Donny DeSimone admitted at trial that he had told at least one other person that he had participated in the robbery &#8212; was insufficient to establish the trustworthiness of the statements. The strictures of Rule 804(b)(3) cannot be satisfied by a showing of speculative possibilities, but, rather, demand meaningful corroboration of proffered testimony. <i>See United States v. Mackey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743003\"><a href=\"/opinion/743003/united-states-v-christopher-d-mackey/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1997) (\"[T]he requirement for corroboration is not unrealistically severe but does go beyond minimal corroboration.\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Measured by that yardstick, we cannot say that the district court's refusal to accept these minimally corroborative evidentiary fragments as sufficient indicia of trustworthiness constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. JURY TAINT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's cardinal claim is that the jurors' brief exposure to the text of the three severed counts necessitated a new trial. In approaching this claim, we first examine the appellant's assertion that the introduction of the unredacted indictment into the jury room, although accidental, triggered a presumption of prejudice. Rejecting that proposition, we proceed to assess the trial court's handling of the discovery that a deliberating jury had been exposed to information that carried the potential to do substantive damage. In the end, we conclude that the district court did not misuse its discretion in concluding that the jury's ability to render an impartial verdict remained intact (and that, therefore, the appellant's due process rights had not been infringed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Presumption of Prejudice.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's claim that the facts of this case demand a presumption of prejudice derives from the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Remmer v.

In contrast, the record here is reasonably clear that the presence of the unredacted indictment in the jury room was due to an inadvertent error by court personnel, and the appellant has not claimed that the document was insinuated into the jury room for some nefarious purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the <i>Remmer</i> Court was especially troubled by the trial court's decision to request an FBI investigation based on scanty information obtained during an ex parte meeting with the prosecution. <i>Remmer,</i> 347 U.S. at 228, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105202\"><a href=\"/opinion/105202/remmer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">450</span></a></span>. That element, too, is missing from the instant case. Here, the trial judge kept all counsel apprised and engaged throughout his in-depth investigation into the matter, and diligently fleshed out the circumstances of the taint-producing incident. Given the absence of any egregious circumstances, we conclude that <i>Remmer</i> is inapposite and decline to apply it here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to keep <i>Remmer</i> in play, the appellant cites two cases previously decided by this court. The first such case, <i>United States v. Santana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763557\"><a href=\"/opinion/763557/united-states-v-julio-c-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1999), is clearly inapposite. That case turned on the trial court's decision to permit the jury to consider, <i>as evidence of guilt,</i> information &#8212; a view of the defendant's ears &#8212; presented to it for the first time during deliberations. <i>See id.</i> at 63-64. Here, unlike in <i>Santana,</i> the information that the jury improperly acquired during its deliberations (the unredacted indictment) was not received as evidence, and the court told the jury, in no uncertain terms, to disregard it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's reliance on <i>United States v. Maguire,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551274\"><a href=\"/opinion/551274/united-states-v-john-j-maguire-united-states-v-thomas-m-kavanagh/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990), is similarly misplaced. There, the trial judge erroneously instructed the venire during jury empanelment about a count that had been severed. <i>See id.</i> at 266. The court denied the defendant's motion for a mistrial, but told the jury to disregard the reference to the severed count. <i>Id.</i> The jury convicted the defendant. We upheld the conviction, concluding that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Id.</i> at 266-68. Although the panel did observe, in dictum, that the \"reference to the severed count was presumptively prejudicial,\" <i>id.</i> at 267, we reject the appellant's effort to attach talismanic significance to that allusion. The panel neither cited <i>Remmer</i> nor conducted any analysis suggesting that it was undertaking a <i>Remmer</i>-based inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To conclude, we abjure any extension of the <i>Remmer</i> presumption to these facts. The appellant's claim of jury taint must be judged by more conventional standards. It is to that task that we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Merits of the Appellant's Claim.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start this phase of our inquiry by revisiting certain generally applicable legal principles. We then describe the trial court's investigation into the possibility of jury taint, its findings, and its resolution of the matter. Finally, we evaluate the court's handling of the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Legal Landscape.</i> Where, as here, a colorable claim of jury taint surfaces during jury deliberations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the trial court has a duty to investigate the allegation promptly. <i>United States v. Hunnewell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533778\"><a href=\"/opinion/533778/united-states-v-dale-scott-hunnewell/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">955</span></a></span>, 961 (1st Cir.1989). The purpose of that inquiry is twofold: to ascertain whether some taint-producing event actually occurred, and if so, to assess the magnitude of the event and the extent of any resultant prejudice. <i>Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 258. If the court finds both a taint-producing event and a significant potential for prejudice, the court must then consider the extent to which prophylactic measures (such as the discharge of particular jurors or the pronouncement of curative instructions) will suffice to alleviate that prejudice. <i>See Gomes,</i> 177 F.3d at 82. In some instances, a likelihood of residual prejudice may remain despite the court's best efforts. In that event, the court must grant a timely motion for a mistrial (if one is made). The objective of this painstaking process is to ensure that the parties \"receive[] the trial by an unbiased jury to which the Constitution entitles them.\" <i>United States v. Anello,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454263\"><a href=\"/opinion/454263/united-states-v-anthony-anello-united-states-of-america-v-daniel-duval/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span>, 258 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conducting an inquiry into a colorable question of jury taint is a delicate matter, and there is no pat procedure for such an inquiry. <i>Evans v. Young,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510290\"><a href=\"/opinion/510290/robert-evans-v-warren-young-superintendent-of-waupun-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1081</span></a></span>, 1083-84 (7th Cir.1988) (explaining that trial courts have wide discretion to evaluate pre-verdict claims of alleged jury misconduct as they deem appropriate); <i>Hunnewell,</i> 891 F.2d at 961 (stating that the trial court has \"considerable leeway\" in determining how to structure its investigation); <i>see also Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 258 (noting that \"the kaleidoscopic variety of possible problems counsels in favor of flexibility\"). Consequently, the trial court has wide discretion to fashion an appropriate procedure for assessing whether the jury has been exposed to substantively damaging information, and if so, whether cognizable prejudice is an inevitable and ineradicable concomitant of that exposure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Proceedings Below.</i> This brings us to the proceedings below. The introduction of an extraneous document into the jury room during deliberations is always a cause for concern. The intrusion was effected in this instance by an indictment &#8212; an official document bearing the government's imprimatur. That document contained three counts that were not before the jury, and those counts charged the appellant with serious malefactions (of which the jury had no other knowledge). Thus, the acknowledged presence of the unredacted indictment in the jury room gave rise to a colorable claim of actual prejudice and posed a significant threat to the jurors' ability to render an impartial verdict. The question, then, reduces to whether the trial court investigated the claim appropriately and resolved it in a satisfactory manner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court recognized these realities. Upon learning that the unredacted indictment had infiltrated the jury room, the court immediately alerted counsel and solicited suggestions about the most advisable way to handle the situation. Adopting defense counsel's recommendation, the court assembled the jurors, informed them of the need for an inquiry, and instructed them not to discuss the matter amongst themselves. The court then proceeded to interview the jurors one by one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the individual voir dire examinations revealed some slight discrepancies in the jurors' accounts concerning their exposure to the text of the unredacted indictment, the differences are not material here. For the most part, a consistent picture emerged. The jurors agreed that, at the start of the second day of deliberations, one of their number noticed a copy of the indictment that contained some \"extra\" counts. He mentioned this oddity to his fellow venirepersons, and, at the urging of some of them, read aloud the text of count 7 (an obstruction of justice charge). After a brief discussion, the jurors concluded that the document did not belong in the jury room, and the jury foreman brought it to the court security officer. He told the officer that: \"We found this document in the group of materials and it doesn't seem to belong there. It has more counts than are in the verdict slip.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After concluding this initial round of voir dire examinations, the trial court made the following finding (out of the jurors' earshot):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are inconsistencies among the recollections.... None of them seem to be material. There is a core quality to this: First, a recognition that there was something unusual; second, a recognition that there was something that was not properly before them; number three, their recognition that they should put it out of their deliberations, certain facts and circumstances.... In fact, they responded &#8212; from my perspective &#8212; precisely the way jurors are supposed to respond ... if they were exposed to extraneous information, including bringing it to my attention....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then reassembled the jurors, instructed them that it was their duty to decide the case based on their \"evaluation only of the evidence that's presented to you here in trial and not by consideration of other extraneous matters,\" and launched into a strongly-worded curative instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> At that juncture, the court undertook a second round of individual voir dire examinations, this time focusing on each individual juror's ability to \"put out of [his or her] mind[] entirely the facts and circumstances of the extraneous document\" so that he or she might decide the case solely on the evidence introduced at trial. Eleven of the twelve jurors expressed confidence that they could function in that pristine fashion and satisfied the court of their ability to do so. Without objection, the court dismissed the lone dissenter. After rejecting the appellant's challenges to three additional jurors, the judge directed the remaining jurors to resume deliberations with a view toward reaching a verdict. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 23(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Adequacy of the Trial Court's Handiwork.</i> We now test the trial court's handiwork against the abuse-of-discretion benchmark. <i>See Boylan,</i> 898 F.2d at 262; <i>Hunnewell,</i> 891 F.2d at 961. In this context, however, review for abuse of discretion connotes a certain rigor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we use the term, the abuse-of-discretion standard encompasses multiple layers of inquiry. <i>See Koon v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 98-100, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span> (1996). Under it, we accept the trial court's factual findings only to the extent that they are not clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Castro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197657\"><a href=\"/opinion/197657/united-states-v-castro/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span>, 229 (1st Cir.1997). We next examine the legal principles on which the court premised its decision, mindful that an error of law invariably constitutes an abuse of discretion. <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197848\"><a href=\"/opinion/197848/in-re-v-grand-jury/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span>, 444 (1st Cir.1998). This particular inquiry is conducted without any special deference to the trial court's views, <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197800\"><a href=\"/opinion/197800/united-states-v-snyder/\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.1998), and extends to the court's application of the law to the facts as found. Only then do we ask whether, given the totality of the circumstances then and there obtaining, the sum of the trial court's acts and omissions constituted a misuse of its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting from this vantage point, we turn first to the procedure employed below. For all practical purposes, the lower court replicated the <i>Boylan</i> model &#8212; a model that we previously have deemed \"methodologically sound.\" 898 F.2d at 259. The court engaged counsel for both sides in an ongoing dialogue about the most appropriate way in which to handle the needed investigation, examined each juror twice, and pursued no fewer than eight lines of questioning proposed by defense counsel. The court's probing into the extent of the jurors' exposure to the extraneous information and its potential impact on their ability to render an impartial verdict was thorough and incisive. The court gave the jury clear and emphatic curative instructions. Last &#8212; but surely not least &#8212; the court made explicit findings that are amply rooted in the transcript of the two rounds of voir dire examinations and that make considerable sense when scrutinized against the record of the trial as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant raises two specific objections to the trial court's findings. First, the appellant takes aim at a statement made by a retained juror during the second round of questioning. When pressed by the judge to expound upon his comment that \"the gravity of the discussion weighs some,\" the juror responded that: \"I believe that the outcome of the trial and the verdict turns on the very unexpected and serious change in the evidence presented.\" Considered in isolation, that comment might raise a reader's eyebrow &#8212; but the colloquy that ensued between the judge and the juror makes manifest that the juror's remark was not a cause for concern. In that colloquy, the juror assured the judge that he would not consider the extraneous material and characterized his earlier statement as \"a poor choice of words.\" Viewed in that light, we do not believe that the court's decision to retain the juror constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the appellant argues that the court's finding that the incident yielded no residuum of unfair prejudice failed to take into account that the jury's exposure to the severed counts undermined his principal trial strategy. In this regard, defense counsel credibly claimed that she had made a conscious decision to avoid any reference to the Niditch incident (which comprised the subject matter of the three severed counts, <i>see supra</i> note 1) in order to preclude \"opening the door\" to the government's introduction of \"highly charged\" evidence related to that topic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this argument is that the inadvertent exposure of the jury to the unredacted indictment did not lead to the introduction of any <i>evidence</i> concerning the Niditch incident, and the court found as a fact that the retained jurors were fully able to put aside their brief encounter with the allegations contained in the severed counts. The fact that the exposure was to an indictment, rather than to information of evidentiary quality, weighs in the government's favor. Before deliberations commenced (and, thus, before any exposure to the extraneous information occurred), the court had clearly explained that \"[t]he indictment is the document that frames the issues, the charges, the criminal violations that the Government believes it can prove. But ... the indictment isn't evidence.... It's simply the document that you look to to understand what it is that the Government is undertaking to prove in this case.\" The court reinforced this instruction by telling the jurors, after the unredacted indictment surfaced, to \"[p]ut entirely out of your mind any exposure any of you may have had to earlier forms of the kinds of charges the Government was thinking about here.\" Appellate courts ordinarily presume that a jury will follow the trial judge's specific instructions in a criminal case, <i>e.g., Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 740, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></a></span>; <i>Houlihan,</i> 92 F.3d at 1287; <i>Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d at 1185, and there is no reason to abandon that presumption here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the record reflects that the lower court handled its investigation into the \"jury taint\" question with consummate care. Its detailed findings and its conclusion that the jurors' accidental exposure to the unredacted indictment caused no ineradicable prejudice are fully supportable. In words that resonate here, the <i>Smith</i> Court observed that \"[d]ue process means a jury capable and willing to decide the case solely on the evidence before it, and a trial judge ever watchful to prevent prejudicial occurrences and to determine the effect of such occurrences when they happen.\" 455 U.S. at 217, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110645\"><a href=\"/opinion/110645/smith-v-phillips/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span>. The court below carried out this mandate to the letter. Consequently, we hold that the court acted well within the scope of its discretion in structuring the inquiry into the question of jury taint, in excusing a single juror, and in concluding that the remaining jurors' ability to render an impartial verdict had not been compromised.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The appellant received all the process that was due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. THE THREE STRIKES LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court invoked the Three Strikes Law, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c), to sentence the appellant to multiple terms of life imprisonment. The appellant challenges that determination on constitutional grounds. Before addressing this challenge, we describe the statutory scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Three Strikes Law is of relatively recent vintage. It dictates mandatory life imprisonment for any person convicted in a federal court of a \"serious violent felony\" if, inter alia, that person has been convicted on two or more prior occasions of \"serious violent felonies.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3559(c)(1)(A)(i). The statute characterizes various federal and state offenses as serious violent felonies. It places three federal robbery statutes in this category, and, pertinently, adds a generic definition that encompasses:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[A]ny other offense punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years or more that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another or that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 3559(c)(2)(F)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Three Strikes Law also includes a disqualification provision that offers a criminal defendant the opportunity to remove some crimes that otherwise would qualify as serious violent felonies (and, therefore, count as \"strikes\") from the \"three strikes\" calculation. The disqualification provision states, in relevant part, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) Robbery, an attempt, conspiracy, or solicitation to commit robbery ... shall not serve as a basis for sentencing under this subsection if the defendant establishes by clear and convincing evidence that &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) no firearm or other dangerous weapon was used in the offense and no threat of use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon was involved in the offense; and (ii) the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury ... to any person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 3559(c)(3)(A)(i)-(ii). The disqualification provision places the burden of proof squarely on the defendant to prove by clear and convincing evidence that, notwithstanding the government's allegations, his prior felony convictions do not constitute qualifying offenses. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this venue, the appellant does not quarrel with the district court's finding that, on their face, the six prior convictions catalogued by the government constitute \"strikes\" under the Three Strikes Law. He does, however, advance two arguments that implicate the law's constitutionality. We consider these arguments sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Apprendi.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contests the power of the court to take the prior convictions into account, noting that they had neither been referenced in the indictment nor proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, his thesis runs, the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The core holding of <i>Apprendi</i> is that \"[<i>o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction,</i> any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" <i>Id.</i> at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

He says that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c)(3)(A) violates constitutional due process guarantees because it shifts the burden of proof to the defendant and requires him to establish by \"clear and convincing\" evidence that his prior convictions are nonqualifying (and, hence, not countable as \"strikes\" under the Three Strikes Law). Refined to bare essence, the appellant's thesis is that the disqualification provision violates due process in two related ways: (1) by requiring the defendant to prove that previous offenses are nonqualifying, and (2) by requiring that he do so under a heightened standard.

But this is a distinction without a difference: the sentencing process is surely no more exacting than the process of establishing guilt. It therefore stands to reason that <i>Patterson</i> applies with equal force to burden-shifting affirmative defenses made available at the sentencing stage of criminal proceedings &#8212; and that such a paradigm does not offend the Constitution. <i>Accord United States v.

The Supreme Court has upheld a state sentence enhancement provision requiring a recidivist defendant to shoulder the burden of proof of establishing the invalidity of prior convictions. <i>Parke v. Raley,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></span>, 34, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Like the contested state statute in <i>Parke,</i> the Three Strikes Law initially presumes that prior convictions falling under one of the statutorily enumerated definitions are valid, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c)(1)-(2), and then provides the defendant with the opportunity to disqualify the convictions, <i>id.</i> &#167; 3559(c)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken together, <i>Patterson</i> and <i>Parke</i> convince us that a paradigm that allows the defendant to raise an affirmative defense during the sentencing phase of criminal proceedings, but then shifts the burden of proof to him to establish the defense, does not violate due process.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span> (1996), compels a different conclusion. We do not agree. <i>Cooper</i> involved a constitutional challenge to an Oklahoma law that presumed a criminal defendant competent to stand trial unless she mustered clear and convincing proof of her incompetence. <i>Id.</i> at 350, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118018\"><a href=\"/opinion/118018/cooper-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

A unanimous Supreme Court struck down the law on the ground that the heightened evidentiary standard violated due process. <i>Id.</i> at 369, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118018\"><a href=\"/opinion/118018/cooper-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1373</span></a></span>. Starting with the bedrock principle that the state can try only a competent criminal defendant, the Court ruled that this principle trumped the state's interest in ensuring the efficient operation of its criminal justice system through the application of a heightened standard of proof. <i>Id.</i> at 367, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118018\"><a href=\"/opinion/118018/cooper-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The crux of the matter is that a criminal defendant has a fundamental constitutional right not to be forced to stand trial while incompetent &#8212; but he has no comparable right to a statutorily created affirmative defense. <i>See Gatewood,</i> 230 F.3d at 191 (\"There is no fundamental constitutional right to avoid an enhanced sentence based on prior convictions simply because the prior convictions were nonviolent.\"). The <i>Cooper</i> Court drove home that precise point by expressly distinguishing the Oklahoma competency provision from the statutorily created affirmative defense addressed and approved in <i>Patterson. See Cooper,</i> 517 U.S. at 367-68, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118018\"><a href=\"/opinion/118018/cooper-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Since the disqualification provision in the Three Strikes Law is functionally equivalent to the statutory affirmative defense discussed in <i>Patterson,</i> the holding in <i>Cooper</i> is inapposite here. It follows inexorably that the burden placed upon criminal defendants to establish by clear and convincing evidence that their prior convictions are nonqualifying offenses pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3559(c)(3) is not incompatible with due process. <i>Accord Gatewood,</i> 230 F.3d at 191; <i>Ferguson,</i> 211 F.3d at 887.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.

In that situation, appellate courts frequently have framed the inquiry in terms of harmless error, asking, in effect, whether the trial court's determination that an improper outside influence did not taint the jury verdict was supportable.

Here, however, the harmless-error test is a poor fit. <i>See supra</i> note 6.
