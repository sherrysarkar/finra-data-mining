Codefendants  Stanley Prou and  Raheam Johnson\r                         \r\n\nseek reversal  of their  drug trafficking convictions  on various\r\n\ngrounds.   We find  none of their  claims to  be meritorious, and\r\n\ntherefore affirm.\r\n\n     The facts,  briefly  stated and  viewed  in the  light  most\r\n\nfavorable  to the government, are  as follows.   Prou and Johnson\r\n\nwere arrested on April  3, 1995 while meeting with  an undercover\r\n\nagent, Rocha,  for  the  purpose  of  purchasing  cocaine.    The\r\n\ndefendants had  been in  frequent contact  with Rocha  since late\r\n\nFebruary, when an  informant arranged a  meeting between them  on\r\n\nthe  premise  that  Rocha   was  a  large-scale  cocaine  dealer.\r\n\nTestimony showed that the defendants had planned to receive eight\r\n\nkilograms of cocaine on the day of their arrest: two and one-half\r\n\nfor cash, two and one-half on consignment, and three for free, as\r\n\na  reward for providing information to Rocha.  When the agent and\r\n\nthe defendants met,  both defendants were  armed and Johnson  was\r\n\ncarrying a  bag of cash  that contained about  half of  the money\r\n\nneeded  for the  purchase.   The arrests  occurred shortly  after\r\n\nRocha  questioned Johnson  about the amount  of cash  and shortly\r\n\nbefore the drug exchange was supposed to occur.\r\n\n     Both  defendants  argue that  the  district  court erred  in\r\n\nfailing  to  define  the  term  \"distribution\"  as  part  of  its\r\n\ninstructions on the drug  trafficking counts.1  Neither defendant\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  Count  I  charged   the  defendants  with  conspiring  to\r\ndistribute and  possess with intent to  distribute five kilograms\r\nor more of cocaine, in violation  of 21 U.S.C.    841(a) and 846.\r\nCount  II charged  them with  aiding and  abetting an  attempt to\r\npossess  with  intent to  distribute  five kilograms  or  more of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ntimely  objected to  this  omission  at  trial, however,  and  we\r\n\ntherefore  may review only for plain error.   It is apparent that\r\n\nno such error  occurred.  Not only was the  jury fully capable of\r\n\nunderstanding the concept of  \"distribution\" in this context, but\r\n\nthe evidence and remaining instructions negate any possibility of\r\n\nprejudicial  misunderstanding.   We  particularly  note that  the\r\n\ntestimony established  that defendants sought to  obtain at least\r\n\nsome cocaine from Rocha  on consignment, i.e., with a  promise to\r                                                       \r\n\npay  from   the  proceeds  obtaining   by  selling  it.     Thus,\r\n\n\"distribution\" was an integral part of  the scheme set up by  the\r\n\ndefendants.\r\n\n     Prou  additionally argues  that  the court  committed  plain\r\n\nerror by failing to give an aiding and abetting instruction as to\r\n\nhim  on Count II, which charged the defendants with the attempted\r\n\npossession of cocaine with  intent to distribute.  This  claim is\r\n\nwholly   without  merit.     Lacking   an  aiding   and  abetting\r\n\ninstruction,  the jury was left  with the option  of finding that\r\n\nProu  either was  guilty as  a principal  or  not guilty  at all.\r\n\nThus, omission of  the aiding and  abetting instruction --  which\r\n\nwould have permitted conviction  based on a less central  role in\r\n\nthe transaction -- arguably worked to Prou's benefit.  The jury's\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ncocaine,  in violation  of 21 U.S.C.     841(a)  and 846,  and 18\r\nU.S.C.   2.   Counts III, IV and V related  to possession and use\r\nof firearms.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ndetermination  that he  was culpable as  a principal  disposes of\r\n\nthis claim.2\r\n\n     Finally, we  reject Prou's pro  se challenge,  based on  the\r\n\nSupreme  Court's decision in United  States v. Lopez,  115 S. Ct.\r                                                              \r\n\n1624  (1995), to  the constitutionality  of the  drug trafficking\r\n\nstatutes  under which  he was  convicted.   See United  States v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nZorrilla,  93 F.3d  7,  8-9 (1st  Cir.  1996); United  States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nLerebours, 87 F.3d 582, 584-85 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                   \r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                       \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2  To the  extent that  Prou's complaint  is that  the court\r\nfailed to instruct the jury that he could  not be convicted based\r\non his \"mere  presence\" at the meeting with Rocha,  it is no more\r\npotent.   He  failed  to ask  for  such an  instruction  and  the\r\nevidence overwhelmingly belied that defense. \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n",
