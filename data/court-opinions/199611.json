Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges,\n\n                    and Lisi,* District Judge.\n\n\n     George H. Murphy, by appointment of the court, on brief for\nappellant.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and Margaret D.\nMcGaughey, Appellate Chief, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                        September 21, 2001\n\f_______________\n*Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.\n\f          Per Curiam.        A federal grand jury, sitting in Maine,\n\nindicted defendant-appellant Nathan Wade Conley on two drug-\n\ntrafficking counts.        Specifically, the indictment alleged that\n\nthe appellant twice had distributed cocaine in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1).        Both counts invoked the penalty provision\n\nof 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) — a penalty provision that embodies\n\nwhat we have called \"the default statutory maximum\" for cocaine\n\ntrafficking.    United States v. Eirby, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st\n\nCir. 2001) [No. 00-1945, slip op. at 10].               The government then\n\nfiled an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 851, pointing out\n\nthat the appellant had three prior felony drug convictions — a\n\nfact which, if true, would trigger an enhancement provision\n\nbuilt into 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) and boost his potential\n\nmaximum sentence from twenty to thirty years.\n\n          The appellant eventually pled guilty to both counts of\n\nthe indictment, acknowledging in the plea agreement and during\n\nthe   change-of-plea       colloquy     that,     due    to      the    built-in\n\nenhancement    for   prior    drug    felonies,   he     faced    a    potential\n\nmaximum   sentence    of     thirty    years.      The    sentencing       court\n\nsubsequently found that the appellant had committed, and had\n\nbeen convicted for, the three prior drug felonies; that the\n\ncareer offender guideline, USSG §4B1.1, therefore applied; that\n\nthe offenses charged in the indictment involved a total of 196.3\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fgrams of cocaine; and that the guideline sentencing range was\n\n188-235 months (offense level 34; criminal history category VI).\n\nThe court then departed downward on the government's motion, see\n\nUSSG   §5K1.1,     and   sentenced        the   appellant    to    a    150-month\n\nincarcerative term.        This appeal ensued.\n\n            The appellant argues that the district court had no\n\nright to use his prior convictions to increase the statutory\n\nmaximum because those convictions were neither charged in the\n\nindictment nor proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.                      This\n\nargument derives from the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), but it misconceives\n\nthe thrust of that decision.              In holding that \"any fact that\n\nincreases    the    penalty   for     a    crime    beyond   the       prescribed\n\nstatutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond\n\na reasonable doubt,\" the Court specifically exempted \"the fact\n\nof a prior conviction.\"       Id. at 490.          This was no accident:          by\n\nphrasing its holding in that manner, the Apprendi Court left\n\nintact   the     Court's    earlier       holding    in   United       States     v.\n\nAlmendarez-Torres, 523 U.S. 224 (1998).              There, the Court ruled\n\nthat the fact of a prior conviction could be treated as a\n\nsentencing factor rather than an element of a later offense\n\n(and, accordingly, did not need to be charged in the indictment,\n\nsubmitted to the jury, or proven beyond a reasonable doubt).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fId.   at    235.       Almendarez-Torres     governs    this    case    and\n\nconclusively       refutes   the   appellant's   argument.     See   United\n\nStates v.    Patrick, 248 F.3d 11, 28 (1st Cir. 2001);               United\n\nStates v. Terry, 240 F.3d 65, 73-74 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            We add a coda.     In this instance, the prior convictions\n\ndid, as the appellant asseverates, serve to increase the maximum\n\npossible punishment, but the sentence actually imposed did not\n\nexceed the unenhanced statutory maximum.          That is, the guideline\n\nsentencing range (188-235 months), as computed by the district\n\ncourt, fell wholly within the statutory maximum (240 months),\n\nand the sentence actually imposed (150 months) was well below\n\nthat maximum.        We have held before, and today reaffirm, that\n\n\"[t]heoretical exposure to a higher maximum punishment, in and\n\nof itself, is not enough [to work a violation of the Apprendi\n\nprinciple].\"       United States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 122 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).    The triggering event needed to animate Apprendi is\n\nthe imposition of a sentence in excess of the default statutory\n\nmaximum — and the district court imposed no such sentence here.\n\n            The fact that the prior convictions served to increase\n\nthe appellant's criminal history score (and, thus, the guideline\n\nsentencing range) is of no moment.         The Apprendi principle does\n\nnot apply to guideline computations simpliciter, even when those\n\ncomputations result in a higher sentence — so long as the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fsentence    actually   imposed   does    not   outstrip   the   default\n\nstatutory maximum.     E.g., Eirby, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at\n\n10]; United States v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nConsequently, no cognizable Apprendi error transpired here.\n\n            We need go no further.      The district court did not go\n\nastray in the imposition of sentence.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
