GONZALEZ-DEL-VALLE,\r\n\n                     Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n        [Hon. Daniel R. Domnguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                             Before\r\n\n                   Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r\n\n    J. Whitfield Larrabee and Rafael Anglada-Lopez on briefs for\r\nappellant.\r\n    Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega Pacheco,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, Jose A. Ruiz-Santiago, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, and Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant United\r\nStates Attorney, on briefs for appellee.\r\n\nJune 10, 1999\r\n\n           Per Curiam.  Defendant-appellant Felix J. Gonzalez\r\ndel Valle appeals from the district court's determination that\r\nno excess time was served on previous federal sentences and its\r\ndenial of Gonzalez' request that his sentence be reduced\r\n(Appeal No. 98-2219).  We have carefully reviewed the record,\r\nincluding the documentation of Gonzalez' prior federal\r\nsentences.  We conclude that the district court did not err in\r\ndeclining to modify Gonzalez' sentence.\r\n           On appeal, Gonzalez argues that he is entitled to\r\nthirteen months' credit for time served in excess of the\r\nsentence imposed in Case No. 88-009.  This is a new argument,\r\nnot raised before the district court.  Therefore, the plain\r\nerror standard of review applies. See United States v. Olivier-\r\nDiaz, 13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993).  \"Where the error that\r\ndefendant asserts on appeal depends upon a factual finding the\r\ndefendant neglected to ask the district court to make, the\r\nerror cannot be 'clear' or 'obvious' unless the desired factual\r\nfinding is the only one rationally supported by the record\r\nbelow.\" Id.  That standard is not met here.\r\n           Gonzalez claims that his present sentence should be\r\nreduced by four months for time that he spent in a half-way\r\nhouse following his release on parole.  The record reveals,\r\nhowever, that it was a condition of Gonzalez' parole that he\r\nspend the first four months of supervision residing at a half-\r\nway house.  The governing statute specifically authorized such\r\na condition. See 18 U.S.C.  4209(c)(1).  \r\n           Gonzalez also claims entitlement to nine months'\r\ncredit for time that lapsed between the execution of the parole\r\nwarrant and the revocation of his parole.  No excess time was\r\nserved, however.  The record shows that although the actual\r\nrevocation did not occur until September 1993, the total time\r\nto be served following revocation of parole was calculated\r\nstarting from December 10, 1992, the date that the parole\r\nwarrant was executed.  Gonzalez' contention that his due\r\nprocess rights were violated because a revocation hearing was\r\nnot held in a timely manner, even if proved, would not entitle\r\nhim to receive credit with respect to the sentence he is\r\npresently serving.  The harm, if any, occurred in connection\r\nwith Case No. 88-009, not this case. \r\n           Gonzalez' sentence is affirmed. See Loc.R. 27.1.    \r\n",
