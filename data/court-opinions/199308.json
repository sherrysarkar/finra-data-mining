FORETICH,\n\n                      Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                 THE LANDSBURG COMPANY, ET AL.,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n        APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n        [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n              and Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n         Elaine Mittleman on brief for appellant.\n         Paul R. Taskier, Adam Proujansky, Dickstein Shapiro\nMorin & Oshinsky LLP, William L. Chapman, and Orr and Reno on\nbrief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                          March 1, 2001\n\f          Per Curiam. In 1992, the defendants in this action produced\n\nand broadcast a docudrama depicting the bitter child custody dispute\n\nbetween Dr. Eric A. Foretich and his former wife. Foretich responded\n\nto this broadcast by filing multiple suits against these defendants.\n\nIn addition to the present action filed in federal district court in\n\nNew Hampshire, Foretich also filed two suits, one in Virginia and one\n\nin the District of Columbia, that were removed and consolidated in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia. After a\n\nseries of setbacks in that forum, during which the New Hampshire action\n\nwas stayed, Foretich agreed to a comprehensive settlement that resolved\n\nthe remaining issues in the D.C. action and that also required him to\n\ndismiss the New Hampshire action.       Shortly after reaching this\n\nagreement, however, Foretich refused to abide by it and contested its\n\nenforceability in the D.C. District Court. Both the D.C. District and\n\nCircuit Courts held that the agreement was enforceable. In response,\n\nthe defendants filed a motion to dismiss in New Hampshire seeking to\n\nhold Foretich to his bargain. The New Hampshire District Court granted\n\nthe motion on the ground that res judicata prevented Foretich from\n\ncontesting the validity of the agreement.       Foretich now appeals.\n\n          Foretich agreed to dismiss the New Hampshire case as part of\n\na broad settlement agreement to resolve overlapping litigation in the\n\ndistrict court. The D.C. District Court and Court of Appeals later\n\nupheld the agreement so far as pertinent here despite Foretich's\n\n                                 -2-\n\fattempt to back out of it. His objections to the settlement were or\n\ncould have been litigated in the D.C. courts. We see no basis for\n\nallowing him to relitigate those objections here.\n\n          We deny the request for sanctions. In accordance with Fed.\n\nR. App. P. 39, however, costs are taxed against Foretich.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f",
