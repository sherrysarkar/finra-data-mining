Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n         Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Paul F. Markham for appellant.\n     Jennifer Hay Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Heidi E.\nBrieger, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                        March 29, 2001\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.               A jury convicted defendant-\n\nappellant Reynaldo Barnes on one count of conspiracy to import\n\ncocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 963, and two counts of unlawful use of a\n\ncommunication    facility      in    connection      with   drug-trafficking\n\nactivities, id. § 843(b).           The district court sentenced him to\n\nserve 115 months in prison.1                  The appellant challenges his\n\nconviction, arguing that the government presented insufficient\n\nevidence   of   his   guilt.        He    also    challenges   his   sentence,\n\nprincipally by invoking the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n\nApprendi v. New Jersey, 120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000).                We affirm the\n\nconviction.     We direct a slight modification in the sentence\n\nand, as modified, affirm it as well.\n\n                                          I\n\n           We present the facts in the light most hospitable to\n\nthe government's theory of the case, consistent with record\n\nsupport.   United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d 480, 482 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 256 (2000).\n\n           In this instance, the jury supportably could have found\n\nthat the appellant, in an effort to expand his ongoing trade in\n\nillegal narcotics, told one of his quondam customers that his\n\n\n    1To be precise, the court imposed a sentence of 115 months\nfrom the date of the judgment (in lieu of a 168-month sentence\nfrom the date of the appellant's initial incarceration), to be\nserved concurrently with the undischarged portion of a sentence\nthat the appellant already was serving.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fsister, Marla Barnes, could provide the sizable quantities of\n\ncocaine that the customer professed to require.         The customer,\n\nin reality an undercover agent employed by the federal Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration (DEA), accepted the invitation.            He\n\nthereafter met with the Barnes siblings, and Marla Barnes made\n\npreliminary arrangements (or so she said) for a large purchase\n\nof cocaine through her connections in Panama.\n\n         As an initial step in the process, Marla Barnes sold\n\na one kilogram sample of cocaine to the undercover agent.            The\n\nagent paid the appellant what amounted to a finder's fee ($500).\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the larger deal never materialized.\n\nThe Barnes siblings nonetheless were arrested, indicted, tried,\n\nand found guilty.2\n\n         The appellant's insufficiency challenge posits that he\n\ndid no more than introduce the undercover agent to his sister.\n\nWhat happened thereafter, he asseverates, was not his doing.          We\n\nturn to this asseveration.\n\n         When   a    defendant   contests   the   sufficiency   of   the\n\nevidence presented at trial, we must take that evidence in the\n\nlight most favorable to the government \"and decide whether that\n\n\n    2The appellant and his sister were tried together, and we\nconsolidated their appeals for oral argument.       Because the\nappeals raise significantly different issues, however, we have\nopted to decide them by means of two separate opinions. This is\nthe first of those opinions.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fevidence,      including          all     plausible      inferences           extractable\n\ntherefrom, enables a rational factfinder to conclude beyond a\n\nreasonable     doubt       that    the     defendant         committed    the    charged\n\ncrime.\"      United States v. Noah, 130 F.3d 490, 494 (1st Cir.\n\n1997).      In forming its conclusion, a reviewing court \"need not\n\nbelieve     that    no    verdict       other    than    a    guilty    verdict     could\n\nsensibly be reached, but must only satisfy itself that the\n\nguilty verdict finds support in 'a plausible rendition of the\n\nrecord.'\"      United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711\n\n(1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n             We start with the principal charge:                         conspiracy to\n\nimport cocaine.            To convict a defendant of conspiracy, the\n\nprosecution        must    \"show        beyond    a    reasonable       doubt     that    a\n\nconspiracy existed and that a particular defendant agreed to\n\nparticipate        in     it,     intending       to     commit     the        underlying\n\nsubstantive offense . . . .\"                    United States v. Sepulveda, 15\n\nF.3d   1161,    1173      (1st     Cir.    1993).        Proof    of    the     requisite\n\nagreement requires no particular formalities:                          \"the agreement\n\nmay    be   express       or    tacit     and    may    be    proved     by    direct    or\n\ncircumstantial          evidence.\"         Id.         Moreover,       \"[d]ue     to    the\n\nclandestine nature of criminal conspiracies, the law recognizes\n\nthat . . . a common purpose and plan may be inferred from a\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fdevelopment and collocation of circumstances.\"            United States v.\n\nEscobar-de Jesús, 187 F.3d 148, 175 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 212 (1st Cir. 1992))\n\n(omission in original), cert. denied, 52 U.S. 1176 (2000).\n\n            In this case, perscrutation of the record persuades us,\n\nwithout serious question, that the government provided ample\n\nevidence that the appellant intended to enter into an agreement\n\nto   import     cocaine   and    knowingly      assumed    conspiratorial\n\nresponsibility.       The jury, taking the proof favorably to the\n\ngovernment, rationally could have found that while the appellant\n\nwas actively engaged in selling narcotics to the undercover DEA\n\nagent, he suggested that he could help his buyer to obtain\n\nlarger quantities of cocaine through a family contact; and that,\n\nwhen the agent asked him to arrange a meeting to advance this\n\nprospect, the appellant not only complied but also attended the\n\ntête-à-tête and took an active part in the discussion of how\n\ndrugs could be smuggled into the United States from Panama.             The\n\njury also rationally could have found that, as a direct result\n\nof   this     confabulation,    the     appellant's     sister   laid   the\n\ngroundwork for a substantial drug purchase in Panama, with a\n\nview toward importing the contraband into the United States.\n\nPerhaps most damning, the prosecution offered credible evidence\n\nthat,   after   the   bargain   had    been   struck,   the   protagonists\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fexecuted a one kilogram \"sample\" sale, following which the\n\nappellant    accepted     a    $500    cash       payment    for    bringing      the\n\nprotagonists together.\n\n            To be sure, the appellant attempts to minimize his role\n\nby    claiming     that   he    merely       arranged       a     meeting    as    an\n\naccommodation — nothing more — and that the payment was a mere\n\ngratuity.    Here, however, reasonable jurors surely could have\n\nrejected    the    appellant's      spin     on    what     had    transpired     and\n\nconcluded — as these jurors apparently did — that the appellant\n\nwas part and parcel of the conspiracy.                    In examining evidence\n\nand   drawing     inferences    from     it,      \"criminal       juries    are   not\n\nexpected to ignore what is perfectly obvious.\"                     Echeverri, 982\n\nF.2d at 679.\n\n            Nor is it any defense that the appellant was not a\n\nprime mover in the conspiracy.               After all, a conspiracy is a\n\ncontinuum.      Once a participant knowingly helps to initiate the\n\nagreement    and    set   it   in     motion,      he   assumes     conspirator's\n\nresponsibility for the foreseeable actions of his confederates\n\nwithin the scope of the conspiratorial agreement,3 whether or not\n\nhe is aware of precisely what steps they plan to take to\n\n\n      3\n      There is an exception, of course, for cases of abandonment,\nsee United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1234 (1st Cir. 1994);\nUnited States v. Juodakis, 834 F.2d 1099, 1102-03 (1st Cir.\n1987)(per curiam), but the appellant did not raise an\nabandonment defense in this case.\n\n                                       -6-\n\faccomplish the agreed goals.          E.g., United States v. Rivera-\n\nSantiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir. 1989).               On this basis,\n\nthe government presented more than enough evidence to ground the\n\nappellant's conviction on the conspiracy count.\n\n           The remaining two counts of the indictment charge\n\nunlawful use of a communications facility in connection with\n\ndrug-trafficking activities.          Apart from his assault on the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence vis-à-vis his conspiracy conviction,\n\nthe appellant makes no independent attempt to argue against the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence presented on these charges.                   Any\n\nsuch argument is, therefore, foreclosed.             See United States v.\n\nZannino,   895   F.2d   1,   17    (1st    Cir.   1990)    (explaining    that\n\narguments not developed on appeal are deemed abandoned).                   We\n\nadd, moreover, that the record does not lend the slightest\n\nsupport to such a challenge; the proof seems unassailable that\n\ncritical   aspects      of   the    conspiracy      were    facilitated     by\n\ntelephonic means.\n\n           For these reasons, we uphold the finding of guilt as\n\nto each and all of the counts of conviction.\n\n                                     II\n\n           The appellant's misgivings about his sentence have more\n\nbite.   The lower court imposed an incarcerative term variously\n\ncharacterized as 115 or 168 months, see supra note 1, together\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwith a five-year term of supervised release.              Adopting arguments\n\nmade by Marla Barnes, the appellant attacks this sentence on\n\nthree grounds.\n\n                                   A.\n\n            The appellant contends that the district court clearly\n\nerred in its drug-quantity finding.4           We do not linger over this\n\ncontention.      Generally,   when       a    narcotics     transaction   is\n\nunconsummated, the sentencing court may base its drug-quantity\n\nfinding on the negotiated amount of contraband.5                   See USSG\n\n§2D1.1, cmt. (n.12).     The court may, however, use a lower figure\n\nif the defendant proves that he \"did not intend to provide, or\n\nwas   not   reasonably   capable   of        providing,    the   agreed-upon\n\nquantity of the controlled substance.\"            Id.     The defendant has\n\n\n\n      4\n     The significance of this finding relates to the calculation\nof the appellant's guideline sentencing range. The quantity of\ndrugs involved in the offense is a key integer used in\ndetermining an offender's base offense level. See USSG\n§2D1.1(a)(3).    In turn, the offense level, as adjusted,\ninterlocks with the offender's criminal history category to\ndetermine   the   applicable    guideline   sentencing    range.\nSee generally id. §1B1.1 (explaining this procedure).\n      5\n      When a defendant is charged with both a completed\nsubstantive offense and an attempt, the consummated transaction\nmay, in some circumstances, more accurately reflect the scope of\nthe offense.   In that event, the sentencing court may in its\ndiscretion focus upon the amount of drugs involved in the\nconsummated transaction rather than the negotiated quantity.\nUSSG §2D1.1, cmt. (n.12).   Here, however, the sale of a sample\nclearly does not provide an objective measure of the scope of\nthe frustrated transaction.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fthe burden of persuading the court that he lacked intent or\n\ncapacity.6         See id.        We apply these principles here.\n\n              For sentencing purposes, the district court attributed\n\ntwenty to fifty kilograms of cocaine to the appellant.                                  The\n\nappellant         asserts       that     this    figure       lacked    any    evidentiary\n\nfoundation.             But the jury supportably found the appellant to be\n\ncomplicit in the charged conspiracy, and the uncontradicted\n\nevidence          was    that     the    conspirators         aspired    to    import    110\n\nkilograms of cocaine into the United States.                              The appellant\n\nfailed to offer any evidence that the conspirators did not\n\nintend,       or        were    unable    to     procure      and   arrange      for,   the\n\nimportation         of     this    amount       of    contraband.       Thus,    the    only\n\ncredible argument against holding the appellant responsible for\n\ntwenty to fifty kilograms of cocaine is that the quantity should\n\nhave       been    considerably          higher.        Any    error    was,    therefore,\n\nharmless.          See United States v. Hernández, 218 F.3d 58, 71 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (finding determination of drug quantity harmless,\n\neven if erroneous, since it did not affect the defendant's\n\n\n\n\n       6\n     This is a change from prior law. E.g., United States v.\nTillman, 8 F.3d 17, 19 (11th Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (assigning\nburden of proof on this issue to the government).           The\nSentencing Commission reallocated the devoir of persuasion well\nbefore the events at issue here. See USSG §2D1.1, cmt. (n.12)\n(Nov. 1995).\n\n                                                -9-\n\fsentence); United States v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir.\n\n1994) (similar).\n\n                                     B.\n\n          In Apprendi, 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63, the Supreme Court\n\nheld that, \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any\n\nfact   that   increases     the    penalty    for   a    crime   beyond    the\n\nprescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and\n\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"           The appellant urges that the\n\nterm of immurement imposed upon him offended this rule.              Because\n\nthe appellant did not raise this issue below, we review his\n\nclaim of an Apprendi violation for plain error.                   See United\n\nStates v. Robinson, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2001) [No. 00-\n\n1674, slip op. at 6].       We discern none.\n\n          The    narcotics        laws    establish     different    maximum\n\nsentences depending, inter alia, on the type and quantity of\n\ndrugs involved in any particular offense.               With respect to the\n\nimportation of cocaine, the applicable penalty provisions are\n\nfound in 21 U.S.C. § 960(b).         Section 960(b)(3) establishes the\n\ndefault statutory maximum:          a sentence no greater than twenty\n\nyears for importing, or conspiring to import, any substance\n\ncontaining    less   than   500    grams     of   cocaine.       Because   the\n\nappellant's sentence — whether viewed as 115 months or 168\n\nmonths, see supra note 1 — falls below the default statutory\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fmaximum, the Apprendi rule is inapposite to the imposition of\n\nthe appellant's prison term.       As we have said, \"[n]o Apprendi\n\nviolation occurs when the district court sentences a defendant\n\nbelow the default statutory maximum, even though drug quantity,\n\ndetermined by the court under a preponderance-of-the-evidence\n\nstandard,    influences   the   length    of   the   sentence     imposed.\"\n\nRobinson, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 7].\n\n                                   C.\n\n            The   appellant's   final    plaint   has    more   force.       In\n\naddition to a prison term, the court also meted out a five-year\n\nsupervised    release   term.    However,      section    960(b)(3)      —   in\n\ncontrast to the five-year term mentioned in section 960(b)(1) —\n\nprovides for a supervised release term of three years.                       21\n\nU.S.C. § 960(b)(3).       Given this court's previous holding that\n\nsupervised release terms set out in particular sections of the\n\ndrug laws establish the maximum terms for violations of those\n\nsections, see Suveges v. United States, 7 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir.\n\n1993) (construing 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)), we think that Apprendi\n\nrequires that this aspect of the appellant's sentence be reduced\n\nto three years.7    This reduction can, of course, be accomplished\n\n\n     7\n     We recognize that there is a split of authority in regard\nto whether terms of supervised release specified in 21 U.S.C. §\n841 can or cannot exceed those authorized by 18 U.S.C. §\n3583(b). Compare, e.g., United States v. Good, 25 F.3d 218, 221\n(4th Cir. 1994) (holding that such terms are maximum terms),\n\n                                  -11-\n\fwithout either disturbing the remainder of the sentence or\n\nreconvening the disposition hearing.        See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n43(c)(4); cf. United States v. Jackson, 923 F.2d 1494, 1496-97\n\n(11th Cir. 1991) (holding that remand for correction of an\n\nillegal sentence does not require the defendant's presence if\n\nthe correction palliates the sentence).\n\n                                III\n\n         We need go no further.       The short of it is that the\n\nevidence in the case, read in the required light, fully supports\n\nthe jury's verdict.    The sentence itself is proper, except for\n\none particular.     To repair that defect, we instruct the lower\n\ncourt, on remand, to truncate the supervised release term to\n\nthree years.

In forming its conclusion, a reviewing court \"need not believe that no verdict other than a guilty verdict could sensibly be reached, but must only satisfy itself that the guilty verdict finds support in 'a plausible rendition of the record.'\" United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 677 (1st Cir. 1993) (quoting United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the principal charge: conspiracy to import cocaine. To convict a defendant of conspiracy, the prosecution must \"show beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed and that a particular defendant agreed to participate in it, intending to commit the underlying substantive offense . . . .\" United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993). Proof of the requisite agreement requires no particular formalities: \"the agreement may be express or tacit and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.\" Id. Moreover, \"[d]ue to the clandestine nature of criminal conspiracies, the law recognizes that . . . a common purpose and plan may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances.\" United States v. Escobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 175 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting United States v. Tejeda, 974 F.2d 210, 212 (1st Cir. 1992)) (omission in original), cert. denied, 52 U.S. 1176 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, perscrutation of the record persuades us, without serious question, that the government provided ample evidence that the appellant intended to enter into an agreement to import cocaine and knowingly assumed conspiratorial responsibility. The jury, taking the proof favorably to the government, rationally could have found that while the appellant was actively engaged in selling narcotics to the undercover DEA agent, he suggested that he could help his buyer to obtain larger quantities of cocaine through a family contact; and that, when the agent asked him to arrange a meeting to advance this prospect, the appellant not only complied but also attended the tete-a-tete and took an active part in the discussion of how drugs could be smuggled into the United States from Panama. The jury also rationally could have found that, as a direct result of this confabulation, the appellant's sister laid the groundwork for a substantial drug purchase in Panama, with a view toward importing the contraband into the United States. Perhaps most damning, the prosecution offered credible evidence that, after the bargain had been struck, the protagonists executed a one kilogram \"sample\" sale, following which the appellant accepted a $500 cash payment for bringing the protagonists together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the appellant attempts to minimize his role by claiming that he merely arranged a meeting as an accommodation -- nothing more -- and that the payment was a mere gratuity. Here, however, reasonable jurors surely could have rejected the appellant's spin on what had transpired and concluded -- as these jurors apparently did -- that the appellant was part and parcel of the conspiracy. In examining evidence and drawing inferences from it, \"criminal juries are not expected to ignore what is perfectly obvious.\" Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it any defense that the appellant was not a prime mover in the conspiracy. After all, a conspiracy is a continuum. Once a participant knowingly helps to initiate the agreement and set it in motion, he assumes conspirator's responsibility for the foreseeable actions of his confederates within the scope of the conspiratorial agreement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> whether or not he is aware of precisely what steps they plan to take to accomplish the agreed goals. E.g., United States v. Rivera-Santiago, 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir. 1989). On this basis, the government presented more than enough evidence to ground the appellant's conviction on the conspiracy count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining two counts of the indictment charge unlawful use of a communications facility in connection with drug-trafficking activities. Apart from his assault on the sufficiency of the evidence vis-a-vis his conspiracy conviction, the appellant makes no independent attempt to argue against the sufficiency of the evidence presented on these charges. Any such argument is, therefore, foreclosed. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that arguments not developed on appeal are deemed abandoned). We add, moreover, that the record does not lend the slightest support to such a challenge; the proof seems unassailable that critical aspects of the conspiracy were facilitated by telephonic means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we uphold the finding of guilt as to each and all of the counts of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's misgivings about his sentence have more bite. The lower court imposed an incarcerative term variously characterized as 115 or 168 months, see supra note 1, together with a five-year term of supervised release. Adopting arguments made by Marla Barnes, the appellant attacks this sentence on three grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that the district court clearly erred in its drug-quantity finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We do not linger over this contention. Generally, when a narcotics transaction is unconsummated, the sentencing court may base its drug-quantity finding on the negotiated amount of contraband.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See USSG &#167;2D1.1, cmt. (n.12). The court may, however, use a lower figure if the defendant proves that he \"did not intend to provide, or was not reasonably capable of providing, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance.\" Id. The defendant has the burden of persuading the court that he lacked intent or capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See id. We apply these principles here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For sentencing purposes, the district court attributed twenty to fifty kilograms of cocaine to the appellant. The appellant asserts that this figure lacked any evidentiary foundation. But the jury supportably found the appellant to be complicit in the charged conspiracy, and the uncontradicted evidence was that the conspirators aspired to import 110 kilograms of cocaine into the United States. The appellant failed to offer any evidence that the conspirators did not intend, or were unable to procure and arrange for, the importation of this amount of contraband. Thus, the only credible argument against holding the appellant responsible for twenty to fifty kilograms of cocaine is that the quantity should have been considerably higher. Any error was, therefore, harmless. See United States v. Hernandez, 218 F.3d 58, 71 (1st Cir. 2000) (finding determination of drug quantity harmless, even if erroneous, since it did not affect the defendant's sentence); United States v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir. 1994) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Apprendi, 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63, the Supreme Court held that, \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The appellant urges that the term of immurement imposed upon him offended this rule. Because the appellant did not raise this issue below, we review his claim of an Apprendi violation for plain error. See United States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 119 (1st Cir. 2001). We discern none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narcotics laws establish different maximum sentences depending, inter alia, on the type and quantity of drugs involved in any particular offense. With respect to the importation of cocaine, the applicable penalty provisions are found in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b). Section 960(b)(3) establishes the default statutory maximum: a sentence no greater than twenty years for importing, or conspiring to import, any substance containing less than 500 grams of cocaine. Because the appellant's sentence -- whether viewed as 115 months or 168 months, see supra note 1 -- falls below the default statutory maximum, the Apprendi rule is inapposite to the imposition of the appellant's prison term. As we have said, \"[n]o Apprendi violation occurs when the district court sentences a defendant below the default statutory maximum, even though drug quantity, determined by the court under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, influences the length of the sentence imposed.\" Robinson, 241 F.3d at 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's final plaint has more force. In addition to a prison term, the court also meted out a five-year supervised release term. However, section 960(b)(3) -- in contrast to the five-year term mentioned in section 960(b)(1) -- provides for a supervised release term of three years. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(3). Given this court's previous holding that supervised release terms set out in particular sections of the drug laws establish the maximum terms for violations of those sections, see Suveges v. United States, 7 F.3d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1993) (construing 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)), we think that Apprendi requires that this aspect of the appellant's sentence be reduced to three years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> This reduction can, of course, be accomplished without either disturbing the remainder of the sentence or reconvening the disposition hearing. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(4); cf. United States v. Jackson, 923 F.2d 1494, 1496-97 (11th Cir. 1991) (holding that remand for correction of an illegal sentence does not require the defendant's presence if the correction palliates the sentence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The short of it is that the evidence in the case, read in the required light, fully supports the jury's verdict. The sentence itself is proper, except for one particular. To repair that defect, we instruct the lower court, on remand, to truncate the supervised release term to three years. In all other respects, the conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To be precise, the court imposed a sentence of 115 months from the date of the judgment (in lieu of a 168-month sentence from the date of the appellant's initial incarceration), to be served concurrently with the undischarged portion of a sentence that the appellant already was serving.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant and his sister were tried together, and we consolidated their appeals for oral argument. Because the appeals raise significantly different issues, however, we have opted to decide them by means of two separate opinions. This is the first of those opinions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There is an exception, of course, for cases of abandonment, see United States v. Munoz, 36 F.3d 1229, 1234 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Juodakis, 834 F.2d 1099, 1102-03 (1st Cir. 1987)(per curiam), but the appellant did not raise an abandonment defense in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The significance of this finding relates to the calculation of the appellant's guideline sentencing range. The quantity of drugs involved in the offense is a key integer used in determining an offender's base offense level. SeeaUSSG &#167;2D1.1(a)(3). In turn, the offense level, as adjusted, interlocks with the offender's criminal history category to determine the applicable guideline sentencing range. See generally id. &#167;1B1.1 (explaining this procedure).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> When a defendant is charged with both a completed substantive offense and an attempt, the consummated transaction may, in some circumstances, more accurately reflect the scope of the offense. In that event, the sentencing court may in its discretion focus upon the amount of drugs involved in the consummated transaction rather than the negotiated quantity. USSG &#167;2D1.1, cmt. (n.12). Here, however, the sale of a sample clearly does not provide an objective measure of the scope of the frustrated transaction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> This is a change from prior law. E.g., United States v. Tillman, 8 F.3d 17, 19 (11th Cir. 1993) (per curiam) (assigning burden of proof on this issue to the government). The Sentencing Commission reallocated the devoir of persuasion well before the events at issue here. See USSG &#167;2D1.1, cmt. (n.12) (Nov. 1995).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We recognize that there is a split of authority in regard to whether terms of supervised release specified in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 can or cannot exceed those authorized by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(b). Compare, e.g., United States v. Good, 25 F.3d 218, 221 (4th Cir. 1994) (holding that such terms are maximum terms), with, e.g., United States v. Page, 131 F.3d 1173, 1177-80 (6th Cir. 1997) (contra).

Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993). Proof of the requisite agreement requires no particular formalities: \"the agreement may be express or tacit and may be proved by direct or circumstantial evidence.\" Id. Moreover, \"[d]ue to the clandestine nature of criminal conspiracies, the law recognizes that . . . a common purpose and plan may be inferred from a development and collocation of circumstances.\" United States v. Escobar-de Jesus, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765611\"><a href=\"/opinion/765611/united-states-v-eusebio-escobar-de-jesus/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 175 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting United States v. Tejeda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"590212\"><a href=\"/opinion/590212/united-states-v-john-tejeda-united-states-of-america-v-paul-christian/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span>, 212 (1st Cir. 1992)) (omission in original), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span></span> (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, perscrutation of the record persuades us, without serious question, that the government provided ample evidence that the appellant intended to enter into an agreement to import cocaine and knowingly assumed conspiratorial responsibility. The jury, taking the proof favorably to the government, rationally could have found that while the appellant was actively engaged in selling narcotics to the undercover DEA agent, he suggested that he could help his buyer to obtain larger quantities of cocaine through a family contact; and that, when the agent asked him to arrange a meeting to advance this prospect, the appellant not only complied but also attended the tete-a-tete and took an active part in the discussion of how drugs could be smuggled into the United States from Panama. The jury also rationally could have found that, as a direct result of this confabulation, the appellant's sister laid the groundwork for a substantial drug purchase in Panama, with a view toward importing the contraband into the United States. Perhaps most damning, the prosecution offered credible evidence that, after the bargain had been struck, the protagonists executed a one kilogram \"sample\" sale, following which the appellant accepted a $500 cash payment for bringing the protagonists together.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the appellant attempts to minimize his role by claiming that he merely arranged a meeting as an accommodation -- nothing more -- and that the payment was a mere gratuity. Here, however, reasonable jurors surely could have rejected the appellant's spin on what had transpired and concluded -- as these jurors apparently did -- that the appellant was part and parcel of the conspiracy. In examining evidence and drawing inferences from it, \"criminal juries are not expected to ignore what is perfectly obvious.\" Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 679.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it any defense that the appellant was not a prime mover in the conspiracy. After all, a conspiracy is a continuum. Once a participant knowingly helps to initiate the agreement and set it in motion, he assumes conspirator's responsibility for the foreseeable actions of his confederates within the scope of the conspiratorial agreement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> whether or not he is aware of precisely what steps they plan to take to accomplish the agreed goals. E.g., United States v. Rivera-Santiago, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521900\"><a href=\"/opinion/521900/united-states-v-antonio-rivera-santiago-aka-junior-vivique-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span>, 1079 (1st Cir. 1989). On this basis, the government presented more than enough evidence to ground the appellant's conviction on the conspiracy count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining two counts of the indictment charge unlawful use of a communications facility in connection with drug-trafficking activities. Apart from his assault on the sufficiency of the evidence vis-a-vis his conspiracy conviction, the appellant makes no independent attempt to argue against the sufficiency of the evidence presented on these charges. Any such argument is, therefore, foreclosed. See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that arguments not developed on appeal are deemed abandoned). We add, moreover, that the record does not lend the slightest support to such a challenge; the proof seems unassailable that critical aspects of the conspiracy were facilitated by telephonic means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we uphold the finding of guilt as to each and all of the counts of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's misgivings about his sentence have more bite. The lower court imposed an incarcerative term variously characterized as 115 or 168 months, see supra note 1, together with a five-year term of supervised release. Adopting arguments made by Marla Barnes, the appellant attacks this sentence on three grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant contends that the district court clearly erred in its drug-quantity finding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We do not linger over this contention. Generally, when a narcotics transaction is unconsummated, the sentencing court may base its drug-quantity finding on the negotiated amount of contraband.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See USSG &#167;2D1.1, cmt. (n.12). The court may, however, use a lower figure if the defendant proves that he \"did not intend to provide, or was not reasonably capable of providing, the agreed-upon quantity of the controlled substance.\" Id. The defendant has the burden of persuading the court that he lacked intent or capacity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> See id. We apply these principles here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For sentencing purposes, the district court attributed twenty to fifty kilograms of cocaine to the appellant. The appellant asserts that this figure lacked any evidentiary foundation. But the jury supportably found the appellant to be complicit in the charged conspiracy, and the uncontradicted evidence was that the conspirators aspired to import 110 kilograms of cocaine into the United States. The appellant failed to offer any evidence that the conspirators did not intend, or were unable to procure and arrange for, the importation of this amount of contraband. Thus, the only credible argument against holding the appellant responsible for twenty to fifty kilograms of cocaine is that the quantity should have been considerably higher. Any error was, therefore, harmless. See United States v. Hernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769364\"><a href=\"/opinion/769364/united-states-v-jose-ramon-hernandez-united-states-of-america-v-douglas/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir. 2000) (finding determination of drug quantity harmless, even if erroneous, since it did not affect the defendant's sentence); United States v. Ortiz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195351\"><a href=\"/opinion/195351/united-states-v-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir. 1994) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Apprendi, 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63, the Supreme Court held that, \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The appellant urges that the term of immurement imposed upon him offended this rule. Because the appellant did not raise this issue below, we review his claim of an Apprendi violation for plain error. See United States v. Robinson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199304\"><a href=\"/opinion/199304/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 119 (1st Cir. 2001). We discern none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The narcotics laws establish different maximum sentences depending, inter alia, on the type and quantity of drugs involved in any particular offense. With respect to the importation of cocaine, the applicable penalty provisions are found in 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b). Section 960(b)(3) establishes the default statutory maximum: a sentence no greater than twenty years for importing, or conspiring to import, any substance containing less than 500 grams of cocaine. Because the appellant's sentence -- whether viewed as 115 months or 168 months, see supra note 1 -- falls below the default statutory maximum, the Apprendi rule is inapposite to the imposition of the appellant's prison term. As we have said, \"[n]o Apprendi violation occurs when the district court sentences a defendant below the default statutory maximum, even though drug quantity, determined by the court under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, influences the length of the sentence imposed.\" Robinson, 241 F.3d at 119.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's final plaint has more force. In addition to a prison term, the court also meted out a five-year supervised release term. However, section 960(b)(3) -- in contrast to the five-year term mentioned in section 960(b)(1) -- provides for a supervised release term of three years. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(3). Given this court's previous holding that supervised release terms set out in particular sections of the drug laws establish the maximum terms for violations of those sections, see Suveges v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194978\"><a href=\"/opinion/194978/suveges-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 1993) (construing 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)), we think that Apprendi requires that this aspect of the appellant's sentence be reduced to three years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> This reduction can, of course, be accomplished without either disturbing the remainder of the sentence or reconvening the disposition hearing. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(c)(4); cf. United States v. Jackson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554958\"><a href=\"/opinion/554958/united-states-v-larry-william-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1494</span></a></span>, 1496-97 (11th Cir. 1991) (holding that remand for correction of an illegal sentence does not require the defendant's presence if the correction palliates the sentence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. The short of it is that the evidence in the case, read in the required light, fully supports the jury's verdict. The sentence itself is proper, except for one particular. To repair that defect, we instruct the lower court, on remand, to truncate the supervised release term to three years. In all other respects, the conviction and sentence are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is so ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> To be precise, the court imposed a sentence of 115 months from the date of the judgment (in lieu of a 168-month sentence from the date of the appellant's initial incarceration), to be served concurrently with the undischarged portion of a sentence that the appellant already was serving.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant and his sister were tried together, and we consolidated their appeals for oral argument. Because the appeals raise significantly different issues, however, we have opted to decide them by means of two separate opinions. This is the first of those opinions.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There is an exception, of course, for cases of abandonment, see United States v. Munoz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195659\"><a href=\"/opinion/195659/united-states-v-delgado-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1229</span></a></span>, 1234 (1st Cir. 1994); United States v.

The quantity of drugs involved in the offense is a key integer used in determining an offender's base offense level. SeeaUSSG &#167;2D1.1(a)(3). In turn, the offense level, as adjusted, interlocks with the offender's criminal history category to determine the applicable guideline sentencing range. See generally id. &#167;1B1.1 (explaining this procedure).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> When a defendant is charged with both a completed substantive offense and an attempt, the consummated transaction may, in some circumstances, more accurately reflect the scope of the offense. In that event, the sentencing court may in its discretion focus upon the amount of drugs involved in the consummated transaction rather than the negotiated quantity. USSG &#167;2D1.1, cmt. (n.12). Here, however, the sale of a sample clearly does not provide an objective measure of the scope of the frustrated transaction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> This is a change from prior law.

The Sentencing Commission reallocated the devoir of persuasion well before the events at issue here. See USSG &#167;2D1.1, cmt.
