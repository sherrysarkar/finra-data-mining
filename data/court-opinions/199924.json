Shein, on brief, for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart and Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant U.S.\nAttorneys, with whom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney,\nwere on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 24, 2002\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f            Per Curiam.   Defendant Richard Albanese was convicted of\n\nconspiracy to distribute drugs, possession of marijuana, and money\n\nlaundering. He appeals the sentence he received, alleging that the\n\ndistrict court erred in calculating his Criminal History Category\n\nand that his counsel provided ineffective assistance at sentencing.\n\nBecause we find that the defendant was not prejudiced by any\n\nalleged error, we affirm his sentence.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            On April 5, 2000, defendant Albanese was named in a six-\n\ncount indictment that charged him with: conspiracy to distribute\nand possess with intent to distribute over 1,000 kilograms of\nmarijuana (Count I); possession with intent to distribute over 100\nkilograms    of   marijuana   (Counts   III   and   IV);   conspiracy   to\n\ndistribute and possess with intent to distribute over 100 kilograms\nof marijuana (Count V); and attempted possession with intent to\ndistribute over 100 kilograms of marijuana (Count VI).\n\n            Counts V and VI were severed, and the defendant proceeded\nto trial on these counts.     On November 17, 2000, after a three-day\ntrial, the jury convicted Albanese on Count VI. The district court\ndeclared a mistrial as to Count V.\n\n            On January 31, 2001, the defendant entered into a plea\n\nagreement to plead guilty to Counts I, III, and IV.            Under the\n\nagreement the defendant was also obligated to plead guilty to a\n\none-count information, to be filed by the government, charging the\n\ndefendant with money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957.\n\nAll counts were consolidated for sentencing.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f          The   Probation   Department    issued   a   final    Presentence\n\nReport (\"PSR\") on April 30, 2001.       In calculating the defendant's\n\ncriminal history score, the PSR included the following prior\nconvictions: (1) a 1992 Rhode Island conviction for forgery and\n\ncounterfeiting (\"first Rhode Island conviction\"); (2) 1992 Rhode\n\nIsland convictions   for    forgery,    counterfeiting,   and     obtaining\nproperty by false pretenses (\"second Rhode Island conviction\"); (3)\n\n1992 Rhode Island controlled substance convictions (\"third Rhode\n\nIsland conviction\"); and (4) a 1995 Massachusetts conviction for\n\npossession with intent to distribute marijuana (\"1995 Massachusetts\n\nconviction\").    These prior convictions, each worth one point,\n\nyielded a total of four criminal history points.               The PSR then\n\nadded two additional criminal history points, pursuant to U.S.S.G.\n§ 4A1.1(d), because the defendant had committed the instant federal\n\noffenses while he was still serving sentences for the second Rhode\n\nIsland conviction and the 1995 Massachusetts conviction.              Thus,\ntotaling the criminal history points for a score of six, the PSR\n\nplaced the defendant in Criminal History Category III.            Combining\n\nthis with a total offense level of 30, the applicable sentencing\n\nguideline range was 121 to 151 months' imprisonment.\n\n          The district court, accepting the PSR without objection\n\nfrom either party, sentenced the defendant to concurrent sentences\n\nof 121 months on Counts I, III, IV, and VI, and 60 months on the\n\nmoney laundering charge.      The defendant filed a timely appeal,\n\narguing that the district court erred in calculating his criminal\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fhistory    score   and   that    his   counsel      was   ineffective   at   the\n\nsentencing hearing.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            We review alleged sentencing errors to which a party did\n\nnot contemporaneously object for plain error. See United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 731-32 (1993); United States v. Torres-Rosa,\n\n209 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 2000).                To establish plain error, a\n\ndefendant must demonstrate that a clear or obvious error both\n\naffected    his    substantial    rights      and   adversely   impacted     the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\nSee Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-36.\n\n                                       III.\n\n            The defendant asserts that the district court erred in\n\ncalculating his criminal history score in two ways: (1) the court\nfailed to exclude the defendant's 1995 Massachusetts conviction\npursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(1); and (2) the court, contrary to\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(2), treated the first and second Rhode Island\nconvictions as two separate offenses, rather than as one.\n            The Sentencing Guidelines dictate that criminal history\npoints be ascribed to a defendant for \"each prior sentence\" he has\n\nreceived.   U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1.      A \"prior sentence\" is defined as \"any\n\nsentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt . . . for\n\nconduct not part of the instant offense.\"            Id. § 4A1.2(a)(1).      The\n\ndistrict court, based on the PSR, attributed one point to Albanese\n\nfor each of the following \"prior sentences\": (1) the first Rhode\n\nIsland conviction; (2) the second Rhode Island conviction; (3) the\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthird Rhode Island conviction; and (4) the 1995 Massachusetts\n\nconviction.\n\n           Albanese contends that it was error to include the 1995\nMassachusetts    conviction   as   a   \"prior    sentence\"    because   such\n\nconviction was based on conduct that is part of the instant\n\noffense.      Assuming,    arguendo,     that    the   1995   Massachusetts\nconviction should not have been counted as a \"prior sentence,\" the\n\ndefendant would have received three, instead of four, points based\n\non his past sentences.\n\n           Albanese further argues that the court erred by treating\n\nthe first and second Rhode Island convictions as separate \"prior\n\nsentences\" since these convictions were \"related cases.\"                  The\n\nSentencing    Guidelines   stipulate:    \"Prior     sentences   imposed   in\nunrelated cases are to be counted separately.              Prior sentences\n\nimposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence for\n\npurposes of § 4A1.1(a), (b), and (c).\"          Id. § 4A1.2(a)(2).   Again,\nassuming, but not deciding, that the defendant states a valid claim\n\nof error, the district court should have assigned one criminal\npoint, instead of two, for these two Rhode Island convictions.\n\n           The district court, pursuant to the PSR, assigned to the\n\ndefendant, in addition to the points for \"prior sentences,\" two\n\npoints for \"committ[ing] the instant offense while under any\n\ncriminal justice sentence.\"     Id. § 4A1.1(d).        The court determined\n\nthat Albanese was still serving his sentences for both the second\n\nRhode Island conviction and the 1995 Massachusetts conviction at\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe time he committed the instant federal offense.            The defendant\n\ndoes not contest these two criminal history points.\n\n             We need not address the merits of the alleged errors,\nbecause even if we assume, arguendo, that the district court did\n\nerr by assigning the defendant one point for the 1995 Massachusetts\n\nconviction and two points, instead of one, for the first and second\nRhode Island convictions, Albanese still has not demonstrated plain\n\nerror.   One of the requirements of plain error is that a defendant\n\nestablish that the alleged error affected his substantial rights.\n\nSee Olano, 507 U.S. at 734; United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56,\n\n60 (1st Cir. 2001).      This entails a showing that the error was\n\nprejudicial because it affected the outcome of the case.                  See\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 734; United States v. Hernández-Vega, 235 F.3d\n705, 712 (1st Cir. 2000).         Albanese fails to demonstrate any\n\nprejudice.\n\n           If we were to credit Albanese's allegations of error, his\ncriminal history score would not be six points, as calculated in\n\nthe PSR, but four points.      However, this point reduction would not\n\nchange Albanese's Criminal History Category, since Category III\n\ncovers criminal history scores ranging from four to six points. As\n\na result, since no other errors were alleged, the applicable\n\nguideline range of 121 to 151 months' imprisonment would remain\n\nunchanged.      Thus,   even   assuming   error   occurred,    it   was   not\n\nprejudicial because it did not affect the defendant's sentence.1\n\n1\n    Albanese further suggests that the alleged errors were\nprejudicial because, if the district court had properly calculated\nthe criminal score to be four points, it could have found that\n\n                                   -6-\n\f          Albanese also raises an ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nclaim based on his attorney's failure to object to the criminal\n\nhistory   calculations   at   the    sentencing    hearing.    We   have\nsteadfastly held that we will not hear these claims for the first\n\ntime on direct appeal.   See United States v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 26\n\n(1st Cir. 1994); United States v. Costa, 890 F.2d 480, 482-83 (1st\nCir. 1989) (noting that \"[t]he reason for the rule is that a trial\n\njudge is in the best position to evaluate the quality of legal\n\nrepresentation in the first instance\").           This case presents no\n\nreason to depart from this standard.\n\n                                    IV.\n\n          Accordingly, we affirm the defendant's sentence.\n\n\n\n\nCriminal History Category III over-represented the seriousness of\nthe defendant's criminal history and chosen, sua sponte, to depart\nfrom the applicable guideline range. See U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3(e), p.s.\nA remote possibility that the outcome could have been affected is\nnot sufficient to fulfill the defendant's burden of proving\nprejudice. See United States v. Sposito, 106 F.3d 1042, 1049-50\n(1st Cir. 1997) (finding that \"it is not enough, under the plain\nerror standard, that the error could have changed the outcome,\"\nrather \"the error must have done so\"); United States v. Procopio,\n88 F.3d 21, 31 (1st Cir. 1996) (stating that \"mere possibilities\nare not enough\" to show prejudice).\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

Shein, on brief, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Donald C. Lockhart and Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant U.S. Attorneys, with whom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before TORRUELLA and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges, and McAULIFFE,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s\" id=\"fn-s_ref\">*</a> District Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PER CURIAM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Richard Albanese was convicted of conspiracy to distribute drugs, possession of marijuana, and money laundering. He appeals the sentence he received, alleging that the district court erred in calculating his Criminal History Category and that his counsel provided ineffective assistance at sentencing. Because we find that the defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged error, we affirm his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 5, 2000, defendant Albanese was named in a six-count indictment that charged him with: conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana (Count I); possession with intent to distribute over 100 kilograms of marijuana (Counts III and IV); conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute over 100 kilograms of marijuana (Count V); and attempted possession with intent to distribute over 100 kilograms of marijuana (Count VI).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counts V and VI were severed, and the defendant proceeded to trial on these counts. On November 17, 2000, after a three-day trial, the jury convicted Albanese on Count VI. The district court declared a mistrial as to Count V.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 31, 2001, the defendant entered into a plea agreement to plead guilty to Counts I, III, and IV. Under the agreement the defendant was also obligated to plead guilty to a one-count information, to be filed by the government, charging the defendant with money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957. All counts were consolidated for sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Probation Department issued a final Presentence Report (\"PSR\") on April 30, 2001. In calculating the defendant's criminal history score, the PSR included the following prior convictions: (1) a 1992 Rhode Island conviction for forgery and counterfeiting (\"first Rhode Island conviction\"); (2) 1992 Rhode Island convictions for forgery, counterfeiting, and obtaining property by false pretenses (\"second Rhode Island conviction\"); (3) 1992 Rhode Island controlled substance convictions (\"third Rhode Island conviction\"); and (4) a 1995 Massachusetts conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana (\"1995 Massachusetts conviction\"). These prior convictions, each worth one point, yielded a total of four criminal history points. The PSR then added two additional criminal history points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1(d), because the defendant had committed the instant federal offenses while he was still serving sentences for the second Rhode Island conviction and the 1995 Massachusetts conviction. Thus, totaling the criminal history points for a score of six, the PSR placed the defendant in Criminal History Category III. Combining this with a total offense level of 30, the applicable sentencing guideline range was 121 to 151 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, accepting the PSR without objection from either party, sentenced the defendant to concurrent sentences of 121 months on Counts I, III, IV, and VI, and 60 months on the money laundering charge. The defendant filed a timely appeal, arguing that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history score and that his counsel was ineffective at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review alleged sentencing errors to which a party did not contemporaneously object for plain error. <i>See United States v.

To establish plain error, a defendant must demonstrate that a clear or obvious error both affected his substantial rights and adversely impacted the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 732-36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant asserts that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history score in two ways: (1) the court failed to exclude the defendant's 1995 Massachusetts conviction pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(a)(1); and (2) the court, contrary to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2), treated the first and second Rhode Island convictions as two separate offenses, rather than as one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines dictate that criminal history points be ascribed to a defendant for \"each prior sentence\" he has received. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1. A \"prior sentence\" is defined as \"any sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt... for conduct not part of the instant offense.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4A1.2(a)(1). The district court, based on the PSR, attributed one point to Albanese for each of the following \"prior sentences\": (1) the first Rhode Island conviction; (2) the second Rhode Island conviction; (3) the third Rhode Island conviction; and (4) the 1995 Massachusetts conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Albanese contends that it was error to include the 1995 Massachusetts conviction as a \"prior sentence\" because such conviction was based on conduct that is part of the instant offense. Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the 1995 Massachusetts conviction should not have been counted as a \"prior sentence,\" the defendant would have received three, instead of four, points based on his past sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Albanese further argues that the court erred by treating the first and second Rhode Island convictions as separate \"prior sentences\" since these convictions were \"related cases.\" The Sentencing Guidelines stipulate: \"Prior sentences imposed in unrelated cases are to be counted separately. Prior sentences imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence for purposes of &#167; 4A1.1(a), (b), and (c).\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4A1.2(a)(2). Again, assuming, but not deciding, that the defendant states a valid claim of error, the district court should have assigned one criminal point, instead of two, for these two Rhode Island convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, pursuant to the PSR, assigned to the defendant, in addition to the points for \"prior sentences,\" two points for \"committ[ing] the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 4A1.1(d). The court determined that Albanese was still serving his sentences for both the second Rhode Island conviction and the 1995 Massachusetts conviction at the time he committed the instant federal offense. The defendant does not contest these two criminal history points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not address the merits of the alleged errors, because even if we assume, arguendo, that the district court did err by assigning the defendant one point for the 1995 Massachusetts conviction and two points, instead of one, for the first and second Rhode Island convictions, Albanese still has not demonstrated plain error. One of the requirements of plain error is that a defendant establish that the alleged error affected his substantial rights. <i>See Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 734, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></a></span>; <i>United States v.

This entails a showing that the error was prejudicial because it affected the outcome of the case. <i>See Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 734, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hernandez-Vega,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199216\"><a href=\"/opinion/199216/united-states-v-hernandez-vega/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>, 712 (1st Cir.2000). Albanese fails to demonstrate any prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were to credit Albanese's allegations of error, his criminal history score would not be six points, as calculated in the PSR, but four points. However, this point reduction would not change Albanese's Criminal History Category, since Category III covers criminal history scores ranging from four to six points. As a result, since no other errors were alleged, the applicable guideline range of 121 to 151 months' imprisonment would remain unchanged. Thus, even assuming error occurred, it was not prejudicial because it did not affect the defendant's sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Albanese also raises an ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on his attorney's failure to object to the criminal history calculations at the sentencing hearing. We have steadfastly held that we will not hear these claims for the first time on direct appeal. <i>See United States v.
