Jorge  Cancel-Lugo  appeals the  district\r                            \r\n\ncourt's  rejection, following  a bench  trial, of  his claims\r\n\nagainst Carlos  Alvarado  as Executive  Director  of  Cancel-\r\n\nLugo's employer,  the Puerto Rican  Electric Power  Authority\r\n\n(PREPA).   Cancel-Lugo argues that he  was transferred within\r\n\nPREPA because of his political party affiliation in violation\r\n\nof  42 U.S.C.     1983,  the  Puerto Rican  Constitution,  29\r\n\nL.P.R.A.     136 and 146, and 3 L.P.R.A.   1334; and that his\r\n\ndue  process  rights   were  transgressed   because  he   was\r\n\ntransferred without a hearing.   After reviewing the parties'\r\n\nbriefs  and  the  record,  we affirm  for  substantially  the\r\n\nreasons  given by  the  district court  after addressing  one\r\n\npoint not covered in the opinion below. \r\n\n     On  appeal,  Cancel-Lugo  contends  that   the  district\r\n\ncourt's finding  that Alvarado  had no  discriminatory intent\r\n\nand  did not  cause Cancel-Lugo's transfer  is not  enough to\r\n\nsupport  the dismissal of his claims under 29 L.P.R.A.    136\r\n\nand 146,  which prohibit discrimination in  employment on the\r\n\nbasis  of  political affiliation.    Cancel-Lugo argues  that\r\n\nAlvarado could be held vicariously liable for the acts of his\r\n\nsubordinates under 31 L.P.R.A.    5142.  However, our  cases,\r\n\nreading the Puerto  Rican statutes in  light of the  Eleventh\r\n\nAmendment,   refuse   to   impose   vicarious   liability  on\r\n\nsupervisory government officials under 29 L.P.R.A.    136 and\r\n\n146.
