CRUZ-DELGADO, ET AL.,\r\n\n                Plaintiffs, Appellants,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n           DANIEL RIVERA-ROSA, ETC., ET AL.,\r\n\n                 Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n    [Hon. Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                   Circuit Judges.\r\n\nJohn E. Mudd and Ortiz Toro &amp; Ortiz Brunet on brief for\r\nappellants.\r\nIsabel Abislaiman-Quilez and Garcia &amp; Fernandez on brief for\r\nappellee, Ismael Betancourt-Lebron.\r\n\nOctober 13 ,1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Upon careful consideration of the briefs and\r\nrecord, and upon de novo review, we conclude that the claims\r\nagainst defendant Rivera-Rosa properly were dismissed under Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).  The complaint agrees that the defendant fired\r\nwhile in hot pursuit of a person who had just stolen money from a\r\nrestaurant, and the complaint also recognizes that the thief might\r\nwell have been armed.  As thus pled, the complaint does not set\r\nforth a \"purpose to cause harm unrelated to the legitimate object\r\nof arrest,\" and it does not allege \"conduct shocking to the\r\nconscience\" as necessary to state a viable due process claim. \r\nCounty of Sacramento v. Lewis, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 1711-12 (1998); see\r\nalso Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1038 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nWe further conclude that the claims against defendant\r\nBetancourt Lebron properly were dismissed.  On the record before\r\nus, that defendant's connection, if any at all, with the shooting\r\nincident is simply too remote to support a claim of personal or\r\nsupervisory liability.  See Gutierrez-Rodriguez v. Cartagena, 882\r\nF.2d 553, 563 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n                          -2-\n",
