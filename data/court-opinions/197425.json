Cumberland\r\n\nwas  a debtor-in-possession  in a  Chapter 11  reorganization\r\n\nproceeding.  The district court  also affirmed the ruling  of\r\n\nthe bankruptcy  court that  the fine be  given administrative\r\n\nexpense priority status.      Cumberland      appeals     the\r\n\nimposition  of  the fine,  the amount  of  the fine,  and its\r\n\ndesignation  as  a  priority  administrative  expense.    The\r\n\nappellee   is   the  Florida   Department   of  Environmental\r\n\nProtection  (FDEP).  It is the regulatory agency in charge of\r\n\nadministering   certain    Florida   environmental   statutes\r\n\nincluding the maintenance of USTs for petroleum and petroleum\r\n\nproducts.\r\n\n                      Standard of Review\r                                  Standard of Review\r                                                    \r\n\n          Our review, as was  that of the district  court, is\r\n\nde novo.    In re  Varrasso, 37  F.3d 760,  762-63 (1st  Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1994).   Federal Rule  of Bankruptcy 7056,  governing summary\r\n\njudgment in the bankruptcy court incorporates Rule 56 of  the\r\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.

Its brief attacks the findings and rulings of\r\n\nthe district and bankruptcy courts.  The relief sought is not\r\n\na new  hearing but summary judgment in  its favor.  We affirm\r\n\nthe judgment of the district court.\r\n\n                          The Facts\r                                      The Facts\r                                               \r\n\n          Cumberland   owned  and   operated  a   network  of\r\n\napproximately  134 combined  convenience stores  and gasoline\r\n\nstations in  Florida.   Each store-station  had  one or  more\r\n\nUSTs.  There was an average of three tanks per  location.  On\r\n\nMay  1,  1992,  Cumberland  filed  a  voluntary  petition  in\r\n\nbankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\r\n\n          Under  ch. 376.309  of the  Florida Statutes,  each\r\n\nowner of a UST location must \"establish and maintain evidence\r\n\nof financial responsibility.\"   Rule 62-761.480 of  Florida's\r\n\nAdministrative  Code requires  that an  owner of  a  UST site\r\n\nshall demonstrate \"the ability to pay for  faulty cleanup and\r\n\nthird  party  liability resulting  from  a  discharge at  the\r\n\nfacility\"  in accord  with  the Code  of Federal  Regulations\r\n\n(C.F.R.),  Title 40, Part 280, Subpart H.  This C.F.R. allows\r\n\na  UST   owner  to  establish  financial   responsibility  by\r\n\nobtaining  insurance or satisfying a self-insurance standard.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nwith  the affidavits, if any,  show that there  is no genuine\r\nissue  as to any  material fact and that  the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a  matter of law.\"  It is axiomatic\r\nthat the  materials  must be  considered  in the  light  most\r\nfavorable to the non-moving party.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nTo meet the  self-insurance requirements,  documents must  be\r\n\nfiled within  120 days of the  end of the fiscal  year of the\r\n\nUST  owner.   Satisfaction of  financial responsibility  is a\r\n\nprerequisite   for  enrollment   in  the   Florida  Petroleum\r\n\nLiability and  Restoration Insurance  Program (PLIRP).   Fla.\r\n\nStat. ch. 376.3072 (1996).\r\n\n          Cumberland operated its UST  sites from February 1,\r\n\n1992 through  August 27,  1993 without meeting  the financial\r\n\nreporting   requirements  of   Florida  laws   and  pertinent\r\n\nregulations.  Effective August 27, 1993, Cumberland  obtained\r\n\ninsurance  to  satisfy  Florida's   financial  responsibility\r\n\nrequirements.   Cumberland  was, therefore,  in  violation of\r\n\nFlorida's financial responsibility law and regulations during\r\n\nthe bankruptcy period of May 1, 1992 to August 27, 1993.\r\n\n          Florida law also  incorporates 40 C.F.R. 280.110(a)\r\n\ninto its UST regulatory regimen.  Section 280.110(a) mandates\r\n\nthat a UST owner notify the regulatory agency within ten days\r\n\nof  the  filing  of a  voluntary  or  involuntary  Chapter 11\r\n\nproceeding.  Cumberland failed to notify  the FDEP within the\r\n\nten-day period of its Chapter 11 filing.\r\n\n          Florida law provides for  the imposition of a civil\r\n\npenalty  of up  to  $10,000  per  offense  for  each  day  of\r\n\nviolation  for  each  violation  of  Florida  laws  and  FDEP\r\n\nregulations.  Fla. Stat. ch. 403.161 and 403.141 (1995). \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          The  FDEP  brought an  application on  September 1,\r\n\n1993   in  the  bankruptcy  court  for  an  Allowance  of  an\r\n\nAdministrative Expense  Claim in  the amount of  $200,000 for\r\n\nthe bankruptcy period of May 2 to August 27, 1993.   This was\r\n\nthe civil  penalty that  FDEP asked  the bankruptcy  court to\r\n\nimpose on Cumberland.  The FDEP moved for summary judgment on\r\n\nits  application.   A  hearing was  held  on the  motion  for\r\n\nsummary judgment  on  May 23,  1996.   The  bankruptcy  court\r\n\ngranted  the FDEP's  motion for  summary judgment,  imposed a\r\n\npenalty of $200,000 and  ruled that the claim would  be given\r\n\npriority as an  administrative expense.   Cumberland appealed\r\n\nto the  district court, which affirmed  the bankruptcy court.\r\n\nThe case is  now before  us on Cumberland's  appeal from  the\r\n\ndistrict court.\r\n\n          Cumberland  makes  three arguments  on appeal.   We\r\n\ntreat them  seriatim, quoting them as  stated in Cumberland's\r\n\nbrief.\r\n\n          I.      THE   BANKRUPTCY  COURT   WRONGLY\r\n          CONCLUDED    CUMBERLAND   WAS    NOT   IN\r\n          COMPLIANCE WITH PLIRP DURING THE DISPUTED\r\n          PERIOD.\r\n\n          As part of this argument Cumberland maintains  that\r\n\nit was  in  \"substantial compliance\"  with  PLIRP.   It  also\r\n\nasserts that  its failure to  file an affidavit  of financial\r\n\nresponsibility \"should be deemed waived.\"\r\n\n          There  can be no  doubt that Florida  law gives the\r\n\nFDEP  the  authority  to  establish rules  and  regulate  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\noperations  of  USTs  in Florida.    Fla.  Stat. ch.  376.303\r\n\n(1995).    Under chapter  403.141  and  .161  of the  Florida\r\n\nStatutes, failure to comply with any rule, regulation, order,\r\n\nor permit  issued by  the  FDEP is  a violation  of the  law.\r\n\nCumberland does not deny that it failed to file the requisite\r\n\nfinancial  responsibility information  when due.   It  argues\r\n\nthat  on February 1, 1992,  which was pre-bankruptcy, the law\r\n\nmaking a UST owner eligible for enrollment  in PLIRP required\r\n\nonly  \"substantial compliance.\"   Cumberland asserts  that it\r\n\nwas in substantial compliance.  \r\n\n          We agree with the district court that enrollment in\r\n\nthe PLIRP  during the disputed  period is not  an issue.   We\r\n\nnote, as did  the district court,  that the bankruptcy  court\r\n\nmade no findings as  to Cumberland's eligibility under PLIRP.\r\n\nThe FDEP brought its claim for penalties under  the statutory\r\n\nand regulatory provisions of  Florida law.  The PLIRP  is not\r\n\nimplicated.  Violation of the PLIRP results only in exclusion\r\n\nfrom the insurance program, not in regulatory penalties.  The\r\n\nbankruptcy  court, therefore,  was  not the  proper forum  to\r\n\ndetermine Cumberland's PLIRP status.\r\n\n          We  find no  basis  for  holding that  Cumberland's\r\n\nfailure  to  file an  affidavit  of  financial responsibility\r\n\nshould be deemed  waived.  Cumberland's argument  seems to be\r\n\nthat  the gravamen  of the  financial responsibility  test is\r\n\nthat the owner or operator of a UST facility have a net worth\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nof $10 million; that Cumberland at all times had  a net worth\r\n\nof  at least $10.2 million and that, therefore, the filing of\r\n\nthe  financial  reports  should   be  \"deemed  waived.\"    We\r\n\ndisagree.   The gravamen of the offense  is not the net worth\r                                                           \r\n\nof the  UST owner, but the timely filing by such owner of the\r\n\nrequired  financial  reports.   Cumberland  failed  to do  so\r\n\ndespite its knowledge  of the legal  requirements.  And  such\r\n\nfailure  cannot be  excused or  condoned on  the basis  of an\r\n\naffidavit  filed  by  a  corporate  official  (Arthur  C.G.K.\r\n\nKoumantzelis)  on February  15, 1994,  which itself  fails to\r\n\nmeet the reporting requirements.  \r\n\n          II.   UNDER THE  GRACE PERIOD FOR  FILING\r\n          FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  AFFIDAVITS, THE\r\n          DEP  COULD  NOT DENY  CUMBERLAND COVERAGE\r\n          UNDER PLIRP UNTIL AFTER  CUMBERLAND FILED\r\n          ITS BANKRUPTCY PETITION.\r\n\n          This  is  a  variation  of  the  PLIRP  eligibility\r\n\nargument already made  and answered.   We reject  it for  the\r\n\nsame reasons.\r\n\n          III.  EVEN IF CUMBERLAND WAS NOT ENROLLED\r\n          IN PLIRP DURING THE DISPUTED  PERIOD, THE\r\n          BANKRUPTCY COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN\r\n          GIVING AN AWARD OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES AS AN\r\n          ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CLAIM.\r\n\n          Cumberland  first   argues  that  the   FDEP  lacks\r\n\nauthority  to impose  civil penalties.   The short  answer to\r\n\nthis  contention is that the FDEP did not impose the penalty,\r\n\nthe bankruptcy court did.  Under Florida law the penalty must\r\n\nbe judicially imposed.   Cumberland argues that the DEP never\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nsought to impose such  penalties in any Florida court.   This\r\n\nignores two things:  There is no Florida requirement that the\r\n\npenalty sought be imposed  by a Florida state court,  and the\r\n\nbankruptcy court was  the proper  forum for the  DEP to  seek\r\n\nimposition of the penalty sought.\r\n\n          It  is  by  now  abundantly clear  that  in  state-\r\n\nregulated  areas such  as  protection of  the environment,  a\r\n\nbankruptcy court  must  comply with  the  laws of  the  state\r\n\ninvolved.  In re  Virginia Builders, Inc., 153 B.R.  729, 735\r                                                     \r\n\n(E.D. Va. 1993).  Debtors in  possession, such as Cumberland,\r\n\ndo  not have  carte blanche  to ignore  state and  local laws\r\n\nprotecting  the  environment  against pollution.    Midlantic\r                                                                         \r\n\nNat'l Bank v. New Jersey Dep't of Envtl. Protection, 474 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\n494, 505 (1986).\r\n\n          Cumberland  next  challenges   the  amount  of  the\r\n\npenalty.   The  assessment  of the  sum  of $200,000  by  the\r\n\nbankruptcy  court is a  finding of fact  reviewed against the\r\n\nclearly erroneous  test.   We note  first  that the  $200,000\r\n\npenalty is considerably less than the maximum of $647 million\r\n\nthat  could have been assessed.  Cumberland's failure to file\r\n\nwas  either  willful or  grossly  negligent.   It  has  never\r\n\nsubmitted   the   documents  required   under   Florida  law.\r\n\nMoreover,  Cumberland  did  not   notify  the  FDEP,  as  was\r\n\nrequired,  that  it  had  filed a  voluntary  petition  under\r\n\nChapter 11 of  the bankruptcy code.  We have  read the record\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\ncarefully and can find  no compelling basis for  reducing the\r\n\n$200,000 penalty.\r\n\n          The  final issue  is  whether the  bankruptcy court\r\n\nerred in giving the fine administrative expense status.\r\n\n          Both the district and bankruptcy courts found In re\r                                                                         \r\n\nCharlesbank Laundry, Inc., 755 F.2d 200, 203 (1st  Cir. 1985)\r                                     \r\n\ncontrolling.  Before we discuss Charlesbank, however, we must\r                                                       \r\n\nfirst examine  Reading  Co. v.

Petitioner  suffered  grave\r\n          financial injury from what is here agreed\r\n          to   have  been  the  negligence  of  the\r\n          receiver and a workman.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nId. at 477.  The Court also stated,\r               \r\n\n               Although there appear to be no cases\r\n          dealing with tort  claims arising  during\r\n          Chapter  XI   proceedings,  decisions  in\r\n          analogous cases suggest that  \"actual and\r\n          necessary  costs\"  should  include  costs\r\n          ordinarily  incident  to  operation of  a\r\n          business, and  not  be limited  to  costs\r\n          without  which  rehabilitation  would  be\r\n          impossible.\r\n\nId. at 483.\r               \r\n\n          We think this last  observation is pertinent to the\r\n\ncase at  bar.   The  payment of  a fine  for failing,  during\r\n\nbankruptcy, to meet the requirements of Florida environmental\r\n\nprotection laws  is a cost \"ordinarily  incident to operation\r\n\nof a  business\" in  light of today's  extensive environmental\r\n\nregulations.\r\n\n          The question in Charlesbank  Laundry was \"whether a\r                                                          \r\n\ncivil  compensatory fine for violation of  an injunction by a\r\n\ndebtor corporation  engaged  in a  Chapter 11  reorganization\r\n\nqualifies for  first priority treatment  as an administrative\r\n\nexpense  . .  . .\"   755 F.2d  at 201.   A  state preliminary\r\n\ninjunction   had  been  issued  against  Charlesbank  Laundry\r\n\nprohibiting it from committing  a public and private nuisance\r\n\nand from violating a zoning ordinance.  The laundry continued\r\n\nits past  practices undeterred.  Shortly before  a hearing on\r\n\nthe merits Charlesbank Laundry filed a Chapter 11 petition in\r\n\nbankruptcy.  The state court actions were ultimately settled.\r\n\nCharlesbank was  ordered to pay a  compensatory fine assessed\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\ncivilly   for  violation   of   the   temporary   injunction.\r\n\nPlaintiffs sought allowance of  the amount incurred after the\r\n\nbankruptcy  filing  ($11,000)  as  a  priority  claim.    The\r\n\nbankruptcy court rejected the priority claim and the district\r\n\ncourt affirmed.\r\n\n          With  Reading   as  the  lodestone,   we  reversed,\r                                   \r\n\nstating:  \"We see  no reason why  the claim of plaintiffs  in\r\n\nthis case does not fall within both the letter and the spirit\r\n\nof Reading.\"  755 F.2d at 202.   We think the  last paragraph\r                      \r\n\nof Charlesbank  Laundry is pertinent to  the $200,000 penalty\r                                   \r\n\nimposed in the case before us:\r\n\n               We now  touch briefly on  what might\r\n          be considered an  alternative ground  for\r\n          the    district    court's   holding--the\r\n          ordinary presumption against the awarding\r\n          of attorney's  fees.  We think  the court\r\n          misperceived  the  nature  of the  award.\r\n          Counsel fees were not added on to damages\r\n          under any notion of automatic entitlement\r\n          flowing  from  the nature  of  the action\r\n          brought.  They were, instead, the measure\r\n          of  the  compensatory  fine   awarded  to\r\n          plaintiff.    Such  a  measure  had  been\r\n          agreed  upon by  the parties,  the amount\r\n          thereof  being  left   to  the   informed\r\n          discretion  of the  judge.   Clearly, had\r\n          the  judge simply set  the amount  of the\r\n          fine without revealing how he  arrived at\r\n          it,   there   would  be   no   basis  for\r\n          challenging  it here.    We  thus see  no\r\n          justifiable  reason  for not  recognizing\r\n          the  award  here  as   an  administrative\r\n          expense   deserving  of   first  priority\r\n          treatment.\r\n\n755 F.2d  at 203.  This  means, at the least,  that a penalty\r\n\ncan be given priority status.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\n          In In re Mammoth Mart, Inc., 536 F.2d 950, 954 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1976), we noted  that priority status could be  given to\r\n\nclaims  of creditors  \"injured by  the debtor-in-possession's\r\n\noperation of the  business even though  their claims did  not\r\n\narise from  transactions that  were necessary to  preserve or\r\n\nrehabilitate  the estate.\"  We cited  to Reading as authority\r                                                            \r\n\nfor  this statement.

Each store-station  had  one or  more\r\n\nUSTs.  There was an average of three tanks per  location.  On\r\n\nMay  1,  1992,  Cumberland  filed  a  voluntary  petition  in\r\n\nbankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.\r\n\n          Under  ch. 376.309  of the  Florida Statutes,  each\r\n\nowner of a UST location must \"establish and maintain evidence\r\n\nof financial responsibility.\"   Rule 62-761.480 of  Florida's\r\n\nAdministrative  Code requires  that an  owner of  a  UST site\r\n\nshall demonstrate \"the ability to pay for  faulty cleanup and\r\n\nthird  party  liability resulting  from  a  discharge at  the\r\n\nfacility\"  in accord  with  the Code  of Federal  Regulations\r\n\n(C.F.R.),  Title 40, Part 280, Subpart H.  This C.F.R. allows\r\n\na  UST   owner  to  establish  financial   responsibility  by\r\n\nobtaining  insurance or satisfying a self-insurance standard.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nwith  the affidavits, if any,  show that there  is no genuine\r\nissue  as to any  material fact and that  the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a  matter of law.\"  It is axiomatic\r\nthat the  materials  must be  considered  in the  light  most\r\nfavorable to the non-moving party.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nTo meet the  self-insurance requirements,  documents must  be\r\n\nfiled within  120 days of the  end of the fiscal  year of the\r\n\nUST  owner.   Satisfaction of  financial responsibility  is a\r\n\nprerequisite   for  enrollment   in  the   Florida  Petroleum\r\n\nLiability and  Restoration Insurance  Program (PLIRP).   Fla.\r\n\nStat. ch. 376.3072 (1996).\r\n\n          Cumberland operated its UST  sites from February 1,\r\n\n1992 through  August 27,  1993 without meeting  the financial\r\n\nreporting   requirements  of   Florida  laws   and  pertinent\r\n\nregulations.  Effective August 27, 1993, Cumberland  obtained\r\n\ninsurance  to  satisfy  Florida's   financial  responsibility\r\n\nrequirements.   Cumberland  was, therefore,  in  violation of\r\n\nFlorida's financial responsibility law and regulations during\r\n\nthe bankruptcy period of May 1, 1992 to August 27, 1993.\r\n\n          Florida law also  incorporates 40 C.F.R. 280.110(a)\r\n\ninto its UST regulatory regimen.  Section 280.110(a) mandates\r\n\nthat a UST owner notify the regulatory agency within ten days\r\n\nof  the  filing  of a  voluntary  or  involuntary  Chapter 11\r\n\nproceeding.  Cumberland failed to notify  the FDEP within the\r\n\nten-day period of its Chapter 11 filing.\r\n\n          Florida law provides for  the imposition of a civil\r\n\npenalty  of up  to  $10,000  per  offense  for  each  day  of\r\n\nviolation  for  each  violation  of  Florida  laws  and  FDEP\r\n\nregulations.  Fla. Stat. ch. 403.161 and 403.141 (1995). \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          The  FDEP  brought an  application on  September 1,\r\n\n1993   in  the  bankruptcy  court  for  an  Allowance  of  an\r\n\nAdministrative Expense  Claim in  the amount of  $200,000 for\r\n\nthe bankruptcy period of May 2 to August 27, 1993.   This was\r\n\nthe civil  penalty that  FDEP asked  the bankruptcy  court to\r\n\nimpose on Cumberland.  The FDEP moved for summary judgment on\r\n\nits  application.   A  hearing was  held  on the  motion  for\r\n\nsummary judgment  on  May 23,  1996.   The  bankruptcy  court\r\n\ngranted  the FDEP's  motion for  summary judgment,  imposed a\r\n\npenalty of $200,000 and  ruled that the claim would  be given\r\n\npriority as an  administrative expense.   Cumberland appealed\r\n\nto the  district court, which affirmed  the bankruptcy court.\r\n\nThe case is  now before  us on Cumberland's  appeal from  the\r\n\ndistrict court.\r\n\n          Cumberland  makes  three arguments  on appeal.   We\r\n\ntreat them  seriatim, quoting them as  stated in Cumberland's\r\n\nbrief.\r\n\n          I.      THE   BANKRUPTCY  COURT   WRONGLY\r\n          CONCLUDED    CUMBERLAND   WAS    NOT   IN\r\n          COMPLIANCE WITH PLIRP DURING THE DISPUTED\r\n          PERIOD.\r\n\n          As part of this argument Cumberland maintains  that\r\n\nit was  in  \"substantial compliance\"  with  PLIRP.   It  also\r\n\nasserts that  its failure to  file an affidavit  of financial\r\n\nresponsibility \"should be deemed waived.\"\r\n\n          There  can be no  doubt that Florida  law gives the\r\n\nFDEP  the  authority  to  establish rules  and  regulate  the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\noperations  of  USTs  in Florida.    Fla.  Stat. ch.  376.303\r\n\n(1995).    Under chapter  403.141  and  .161  of the  Florida\r\n\nStatutes, failure to comply with any rule, regulation, order,\r\n\nor permit  issued by  the  FDEP is  a violation  of the  law.\r\n\nCumberland does not deny that it failed to file the requisite\r\n\nfinancial  responsibility information  when due.   It  argues\r\n\nthat  on February 1, 1992,  which was pre-bankruptcy, the law\r\n\nmaking a UST owner eligible for enrollment  in PLIRP required\r\n\nonly  \"substantial compliance.\"   Cumberland asserts  that it\r\n\nwas in substantial compliance.  \r\n\n          We agree with the district court that enrollment in\r\n\nthe PLIRP  during the disputed  period is not  an issue.   We\r\n\nnote, as did  the district court,  that the bankruptcy  court\r\n\nmade no findings as  to Cumberland's eligibility under PLIRP.\r\n\nThe FDEP brought its claim for penalties under  the statutory\r\n\nand regulatory provisions of  Florida law.  The PLIRP  is not\r\n\nimplicated.  Violation of the PLIRP results only in exclusion\r\n\nfrom the insurance program, not in regulatory penalties.  The\r\n\nbankruptcy  court, therefore,  was  not the  proper forum  to\r\n\ndetermine Cumberland's PLIRP status.\r\n\n          We  find no  basis  for  holding that  Cumberland's\r\n\nfailure  to  file an  affidavit  of  financial responsibility\r\n\nshould be deemed  waived.  Cumberland's argument  seems to be\r\n\nthat  the gravamen  of the  financial responsibility  test is\r\n\nthat the owner or operator of a UST facility have a net worth\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nof $10 million; that Cumberland at all times had  a net worth\r\n\nof  at least $10.2 million and that, therefore, the filing of\r\n\nthe  financial  reports  should   be  \"deemed  waived.\"    We\r\n\ndisagree.   The gravamen of the offense  is not the net worth\r                                                           \r\n\nof the  UST owner, but the timely filing by such owner of the\r\n\nrequired  financial  reports.   Cumberland  failed  to do  so\r\n\ndespite its knowledge  of the legal  requirements.  And  such\r\n\nfailure  cannot be  excused or  condoned on  the basis  of an\r\n\naffidavit  filed  by  a  corporate  official  (Arthur  C.G.K.\r\n\nKoumantzelis)  on February  15, 1994,  which itself  fails to\r\n\nmeet the reporting requirements.  \r\n\n          II.   UNDER THE  GRACE PERIOD FOR  FILING\r\n          FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY  AFFIDAVITS, THE\r\n          DEP  COULD  NOT DENY  CUMBERLAND COVERAGE\r\n          UNDER PLIRP UNTIL AFTER  CUMBERLAND FILED\r\n          ITS BANKRUPTCY PETITION.\r\n\n          This  is  a  variation  of  the  PLIRP  eligibility\r\n\nargument already made  and answered.   We reject  it for  the\r\n\nsame reasons.\r\n\n          III.  EVEN IF CUMBERLAND WAS NOT ENROLLED\r\n          IN PLIRP DURING THE DISPUTED  PERIOD, THE\r\n          BANKRUPTCY COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN\r\n          GIVING AN AWARD OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES AS AN\r\n          ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE CLAIM.\r\n\n          Cumberland  first   argues  that  the   FDEP  lacks\r\n\nauthority  to impose  civil penalties.   The short  answer to\r\n\nthis  contention is that the FDEP did not impose the penalty,\r\n\nthe bankruptcy court did.  Under Florida law the penalty must\r\n\nbe judicially imposed.   Cumberland argues that the DEP never\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nsought to impose such  penalties in any Florida court.   This\r\n\nignores two things:  There is no Florida requirement that the\r\n\npenalty sought be imposed  by a Florida state court,  and the\r\n\nbankruptcy court was  the proper  forum for the  DEP to  seek\r\n\nimposition of the penalty sought.\r\n\n          It  is  by  now  abundantly clear  that  in  state-\r\n\nregulated  areas such  as  protection of  the environment,  a\r\n\nbankruptcy court  must  comply with  the  laws of  the  state\r\n\ninvolved.

The  assessment  of the  sum  of $200,000  by  the\r\n\nbankruptcy  court is a  finding of fact  reviewed against the\r\n\nclearly erroneous  test.   We note  first  that the  $200,000\r\n\npenalty is considerably less than the maximum of $647 million\r\n\nthat  could have been assessed.  Cumberland's failure to file\r\n\nwas  either  willful or  grossly  negligent.   It  has  never\r\n\nsubmitted   the   documents  required   under   Florida  law.\r\n\nMoreover,  Cumberland  did  not   notify  the  FDEP,  as  was\r\n\nrequired,  that  it  had  filed a  voluntary  petition  under\r\n\nChapter 11 of  the bankruptcy code.

The  payment of  a fine  for failing,  during\r\n\nbankruptcy, to meet the requirements of Florida environmental\r\n\nprotection laws  is a cost \"ordinarily  incident to operation\r\n\nof a  business\" in  light of today's  extensive environmental\r\n\nregulations.\r\n\n          The question in Charlesbank  Laundry was \"whether a\r                                                          \r\n\ncivil  compensatory fine for violation of  an injunction by a\r\n\ndebtor corporation  engaged  in a  Chapter 11  reorganization\r\n\nqualifies for  first priority treatment  as an administrative\r\n\nexpense  . .  . .\"   755 F.2d  at 201.   A  state preliminary\r\n\ninjunction   had  been  issued  against  Charlesbank  Laundry\r\n\nprohibiting it from committing  a public and private nuisance\r\n\nand from violating a zoning ordinance.  The laundry continued\r\n\nits past  practices undeterred.  Shortly before  a hearing on\r\n\nthe merits Charlesbank Laundry filed a Chapter 11 petition in\r\n\nbankruptcy.  The state court actions were ultimately settled.\r\n\nCharlesbank was  ordered to pay a  compensatory fine assessed\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\ncivilly   for  violation   of   the   temporary   injunction.\r\n\nPlaintiffs sought allowance of  the amount incurred after the\r\n\nbankruptcy  filing  ($11,000)  as  a  priority  claim.    The\r\n\nbankruptcy court rejected the priority claim and the district\r\n\ncourt affirmed.\r\n\n          With  Reading   as  the  lodestone,   we  reversed,\r                                   \r\n\nstating:  \"We see  no reason why  the claim of plaintiffs  in\r\n\nthis case does not fall within both the letter and the spirit\r\n\nof Reading.\"  755 F.2d at 202.   We think the  last paragraph\r                      \r\n\nof Charlesbank  Laundry is pertinent to  the $200,000 penalty\r                                   \r\n\nimposed in the case before us:\r\n\n               We now  touch briefly on  what might\r\n          be considered an  alternative ground  for\r\n          the    district    court's   holding--the\r\n          ordinary presumption against the awarding\r\n          of attorney's  fees.  We think  the court\r\n          misperceived  the  nature  of the  award.\r\n          Counsel fees were not added on to damages\r\n          under any notion of automatic entitlement\r\n          flowing  from  the nature  of  the action\r\n          brought.  They were, instead, the measure\r\n          of  the  compensatory  fine   awarded  to\r\n          plaintiff.    Such  a  measure  had  been\r\n          agreed  upon by  the parties,  the amount\r\n          thereof  being  left   to  the   informed\r\n          discretion  of the  judge.   Clearly, had\r\n          the  judge simply set  the amount  of the\r\n          fine without revealing how he  arrived at\r\n          it,   there   would  be   no   basis  for\r\n          challenging  it here.    We  thus see  no\r\n          justifiable  reason  for not  recognizing\r\n          the  award  here  as   an  administrative\r\n          expense   deserving  of   first  priority\r\n          treatment.\r\n\n755 F.2d  at 203.

This was followed by the observation:\r               \r\n\n               We   have   recognized   a   special\r\n          category    of   expense    entitled   to\r\n          administrative priority  status, based on\r\n          considerations  of  fundamental fairness,\r\n          see  Reading Co.,  391  U.S. at  477,  88\r                                      \r\n          S.Ct. at 1763, consisting of  amounts due\r\n          entities   \"injured  by   the  debtor-in-\r\n          possession's  operation  of the  business\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\n          even  though their  claims did  not arise\r\n          from transactions that were  necessary to\r\n          preserve or rehabilitate the estate.\"  In\r                                                               \r\n          re Mammoth Mart, 536 F.2d at 954.\r                                     \r\n\nId.   We then analyzed  Reading and Charlesbank  Laundry.  We\r                                                                    \r\n\nheld  that the  \"request for  allowance of  an administrative\r\n\nexpense priority is not within the ambit of either Reading or\r                                                                      \r\n\nCharlesbank . . . .\"  Id. at 6.  We ended this section of the\r                                     \r\n\nopinion  stating:   \"We are  aware of  no authority  that the\r\n\nReading-Charlesbank  exception encompasses a right to payment\r                               \r\n\noriginating in a prepetition contract  with the debtor.\"  Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nat 7 (footnote omitted).\r\n\n          We hold that  the present case does come within the\r\n\nambit  of Reading and  Charlesbank.  This  was a postpetition\r                                              \r\n\nclaim  incurred during  the  operation of  Cumberland  Farms'\r\n\nbusiness while it was  operating under Chapter 11.   We think\r\n\nit would be fundamentally unfair to allow Cumberland Farms to\r\n\nflout  Florida's  environmental  protection laws  and  escape\r\n\npaying a penalty for such behavior.\r\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\r                                                            affirmed\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n</pre>",
