Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Radhames Perez on brief pro se.\r\n Lawrence J. Crowley, Jr., David W. Fanikos and Riemer &amp;\r\nBraunstein on brief for appellee The First National Bank of Boston.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and John A. Capin,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on Memorandum in Support of Motion to\r\nDismiss for appellee Small Business Administration.\r\n\nDecember 30, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Appellant Rhadames Perez appeals from the district court's\r\ndismissal of his lawsuit, which asserted federal claims under the Small Business Act, 15\r\nU.S.C.  631 et seq., the Small Business Capital Enhancement Act, 12 U.S.C.  4741 et seq.,\r\nthe Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and state law.  We affirm for the\r\nfollowing reasons.\r\n          First, the district court dismissed the suit against the former First National Bank\r\nof Boston for lack of  jurisdiction, citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  Although we think that its\r\ndismissal should have been for failure to state a claim for relief, rather than for lack of\r\njurisdiction, see Arroyo-Torres v. Ponce Federal Bank, F.B.S., 918 F.2d 276, 280 (1st Cir.\r\n1990) (ruling that a dismissal based on the lack of a private right of action is for failure to state\r\na claim for relief under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and not for lack of jurisdiction under Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 12(b)(1)); Nowak v. Ironworkers Local 6 Pension Fund, 81 F.3d 1182, 1188-91 (2d\r\nCir. 1996) (same with respect to a dismissal based on the nonapplicability of a federal statute,\r\nand also noting that, where the plaintiff has alleged an action arising under federal statutes, the\r\ncourt has jurisdiction to determine whether the statute applies), we affirm because Perez has\r\nnot challenged these dispositions on appeal.  See United States v. Benavente Gomez, 921 F.2d\r\n378, 386 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that an appellant waives issues not adequately addressed in\r\nits appellate brief).  On appeal, Perez has proffered the existence of a new, allegedly viable\r\nclaim.  Because he did not present this claim to the district court, when he objected to the\r\nbank's motion to dismiss and to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation advocating\r\ndismissal, we do not consider it now.  See United States v. Palmer, 956 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir.\r\n1992) (holding that an issue not presented to the trial court cannot be raised for the first time\r\non appeal).\r\n          Second, the district court properly dismissed the complaint against the\r\nindividual defendant, Heriberto Hernandez, for lack of diversity or federal question\r\njurisdiction.   \r\n          Finally, we affirm the court's dismissal of the action against the Small Business\r\nAdministration.  On appeal, Perez indicated that he was bringing a claim under Bivens v. Six\r\nUnknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971).  In FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.S. 471\r\n(1994), the Supreme Court held that Bivens suits cannot be brought against federal agencies. \r\nAccordingly, the district court lacked jurisdiction over this claim.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens\r\nfor a Better Environment, 118 S. Ct. 1003, 1010 (1998) (holding that a suit is wholly frivolous\r\nand may be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction when the claim is barred by\r\nSupreme Court precedent) (citations omitted).  Given its lack of jurisdiction, the court did not\r\nerr in dismissing the suit without giving Perez prior notice or opportunity to respond.  See In\r\nre Bulldog Trucking, Inc., 147 F.3d 347, 352 (4th Cir. 1998) (stating that federal courts have\r\na \"duty to inquire, sua sponte, whether a valid basis for jurisdiction exists, and to dismiss the\r\naction if no such ground appears\").   For the same reason, it did not err or abuse its discretion\r\nin denying Perez's motion for default judgment.\r\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed, but we modify the court's order\r\nto provide for the dismissal of any state law claims without prejudice.  \n",
