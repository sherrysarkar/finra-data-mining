Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                           Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                 Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Neal K.

These   consolidated     appeals\n\nresult from two sentences imposed upon Scott R. Chapman by the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maine (Carter,\n\nJ.).       On appeal, Chapman raises three issues.                  First, he argues\n\nthat it was error to impose his sentences consecutively rather\n\nthan       concurrently.            Second,       he    disputes       the   two-level\n\nenhancement to his offense level for more than minimal planning.\n\nFinally, he contends that the imposition of a five-month upward\n\ndeparture from the sentencing guideline range, levied on the\n\nbasis      of    his    excessive      criminal       history,   was    unreasonable.\n\nFinding no error in any of these decisions, we affirm.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n                 At the time of the events relevant to this appeal,\n\nChapman, a career criminal, was on supervised release following\n\nhis most recent incarceration.                Among the conditions to which he\n\nwas subject were: 1) that he not leave the judicial district\n\nwithout permission; 2) that he not commit another federal,\n\nstate, or local crime; and 3) that he abstain from all drug and\n\nalcohol         use    and   participate    in    a    drug   and   alcohol    therapy\n\nprogram.1        Chapman violated all three of these conditions within\n\nhis first few months of freedom.\n\n\n\n       1\n       These numbers differ from the original numbering of the\nconditions, as they reflect only those conditions relevant here.\n\n                                            -3-\n\f            On June 9, 1999, as a result of an error on the part\n\nof the Bureau of Prisons which kept Chapman incarcerated 104\n\ndays longer than required, he was released from prison suddenly\n\nand without notice.2        Using the $69 given to him as \"gate money\"\n\nupon release, he purchased a bus ticket that eventually brought\n\nhim to Portland, Maine.        After arriving there without funds and\n\nwith no place to live, Chapman fortuitously found employment and\n\nhousing with John Jollatta, a contractor who gave him work and\n\nallowed him to live at his home.\n\n            Shortly after he began work, Chapman, on two separate\n\noccasions, suffered work-related injuries.                After his second\n\ninjury Chapman was hospitalized.              Jollatta visited him at the\n\nhospital and asked him not to file a worker's compensation\n\nclaim,   offering    instead      to   cover     his   medical   expenses   in\n\nexchange.    Chapman agreed and, after he was released from the\n\nhospital,    moved   back    in   with       Jollatta.    Thereafter,   when\n\nJollatta did not immediately pay the medical bills, Chapman\n\nbecame angry and departed Jollatta’s employment and home, taking\n\nwith him the company’s business checkbook.\n\n\n\n\n    2  This extra time served, however, is not relevant to the\ndetermination of his sentences in this case.    The Bureau of\nPrisons will automatically deduct it from the time he now must\nserve for revocation of his supervised release.\n\n                                       -4-\n\f           Chapman had a savings account at People's Heritage\n\nBank, which he had opened when he first became employed.            This\n\nwas also Jollatta's bank.       On August 2 and 3, 1999, Chapman\n\nengaged in a check kiting scheme using the checks he had stolen\n\nfrom Jollatta by writing several checks to himself for varying\n\namounts, and then depositing them to his account.          Subsequently,\n\nduring the two-day period and at four different branches of the\n\nbank, he either cashed the checks and/or made withdrawals from\n\nthe amounts previously deposited into his account at the bank.\n\nHe also wrote one check to a retail store.         In this way, over\n\nthe   two-day   period,   Chapman   defrauded   People's    Heritage   of\n\n$11,405.96 before it discovered the scheme.\n\n           Chapman was arrested on August 26, 1999, in Montpelier,\n\nVermont.   He attempted to escape from the arresting officers,\n\nbut was caught.    Subsequently, during a search of his residence,\n\ncocaine and illegal mushrooms were found.        On January 18, 2000,\n\nChapman pled guilty to violating the terms of his supervised\n\nrelease by committing a new federal crime and was sentenced to\n\nserve an additional 24 months as a result.           Chapman does not\n\nappeal this sentence.\n\n           On the same day, Chapman also pled guilty to a charge\n\nof bank fraud.     The base offense level for this crime was 6.\n\nThree levels were added pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1(b)(1)(D)\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\ffor   the    amount    of   the    bank's       loss,    two     levels   were    added\n\npursuant     to    U.S.S.G.   §        2F1.1(b)(2)       for   more     than    minimal\n\nplanning.      Finally, and despite Chapman's demonstrated lack of\n\nremorse,3 two levels were subtracted pursuant to U.S.S.G. §\n\n3E1.1(a) for acceptance of responsibility because Chapman had\n\nconfessed to the bank fraud charge.                     This resulted in a final\n\noffense level of 9.\n\n             Chapman    had       an    extremely        long,     continuous,        and\n\nsometimes violent criminal history, including burglary while\n\narmed with a .25 caliber handgun.               Thirty-three criminal history\n\npoints      were   applied    to       Chapman     as     a    result     of    his   13\n\nconvictions, as well as two points for committing the instant\n\noffense while on supervised release, and one point because the\n\noffense occurred within two years of his release from custody.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.1.       Chapman's total of 36 criminal history points\n\nwas well beyond (nearly triple) the 13 points needed to place\n\nhim   in    Criminal    History        Category    VI,     the    highest      category\n\nreflected in the Guidelines.\n\n             The combination of an offense level of 9 and a Criminal\n\nHistory Category VI resulted              in a guideline sentencing range of\n\n21 to 27 months.       U.S.S.G. § 5A (Sentencing Table).                  Pursuant to\n\n\n\n      3\n      Chapman still appears to believe that he was entitled to\ndo what he did because Jollatta had not paid his medical bills.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 4A1.3, however, a sentencing judge may depart upward\n\nfrom a guideline sentencing range where the criminal history\n\ncategory   inadequately     reflects    \"the    seriousness     of     the\n\ndefendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the\n\ndefendant will commit other crimes.\"     U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3.      Because\n\nof Chapman's egregious criminal record, as well as his notable\n\nrecidivist tendencies, the district court sentenced him to 32\n\nmonths for the bank fraud, only a five-month, or 18-19 percent,\n\nupward departure.\n\n           Finally, the district court required that Chapman's 24-\n\nmonth sentence for revocation of supervised release and his 32-\n\nmonth sentence for bank fraud run consecutively rather than\n\nconcurrently, resulting in a total prison term of 56 months.\n\nChapman appeals the decision to run his sentences consecutively,\n\nthe two-level adjustment for more than minimal planning, and the\n\nupward departure from the sentencing guideline range because of\n\nhis   underrepresented    criminal   history.    None   of    the    other\n\nsentencing determinations is challenged here.\n\n                    II. CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES\n\n           Chapman argues that his sentences for bank fraud and\n\nfor revocation of supervised release should have been imposed to\n\nrun concurrently and not consecutively.         However, Chapman not\n\nonly fails to address the relevant guideline, but the argument\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fhe does make is without merit.    He contends that, pursuant to 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3584(a), the district court has the discretion to\n\nimpose either concurrent or consecutive sentences, and that in\n\nthis case that discretion was abused when the district court did\n\nnot consider the mitigating fact that his crime was a result of\n\nhis sudden release from prison. We do not agree.\n\n         Section 5G1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs\n\nwhether a new sentence imposed upon a defendant already subject\n\nto an undischarged term of imprisonment should run concurrently\n\nor consecutively to the existing term.   Application Note 6 deals\n\nwith revocations:\n\n         If the defendant was on federal or state\n         probation, parole, or supervised release at\n         the time of the instant offense, and has had\n         such   probation,  parole,   or   supervised\n         release revoked, the sentence for the\n         instant offense should be imposed to run\n         consecutively to the term imposed for the\n         violation    of   probation,    parole,   or\n         supervised release in order to provide an\n         incremental penalty for the violation of\n         probation, parole, or supervised release.\n\nWe have held that this application note,4 despite its use of\n\n\"should,\" is mandatory.   United States v. Gondek, 65 F.3d 1, 3\n\n(1st cir. 1995); see also United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d\n\n522, 539-40 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"In cases where a defendant has\n\n\n\n    4 At the time of our holdings in Gondek and McCarthy, this\nidentical note was identified as Application Note 4.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcommitted a federal offense while on probation, Note 4 expressly\n\nlimits a district court's discretion in determining a reasonable\n\nincremental punishment by providing that the court must order\n\nthe entire federal sentence to run consecutively to any sentence\n\nimposed     upon    revocation     of    probation.\").            Several     other\n\ncircuits--nearly all of those addressing the issue--have agreed\n\nwith   this    interpretation.           See,    e.g.,     United       States     v.\n\nAlexander,    100    F.3d   24,    26   (5th    Cir.     1996)    (holding       that\n\nApplication Note 6 is \"binding on the courts\"); United States v.\n\nBernard, 48 F.3d 427, 430-32 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\n            Moreover, and as the district court aptly noted, \"as\n\na matter of fact or policy, the only way to effectively enforce\n\nsupervised    release    is   to   require      that    time     in    addition    to\n\nwhatever else he is sentenced for is imposed.\"                 Otherwise, there\n\neffectively would be no punishment at all for violating the\n\nconditions of his supervised release.                  We can conceive of no\n\nreason to upset the district court's imposition of consecutive\n\nsentences for the revocation of supervised release and the bank\n\nfraud itself.\n\n                    III. MORE THAN MINIMAL PLANNING\n\n            Chapman next argues that the district court erred in\n\nadjusting     his   offense   level      upward    for    more        than   minimal\n\nplanning pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2F1.1(b)(2).                   He contends that\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fhis actions were impulsive and opportunistic, and thus do not\n\nlend themselves to this enhancement.                   Even if we grant that his\n\ndecision to abscond with the checks and run was spontaneous,\n\nhowever, the complicated process through which he negotiated the\n\nchecks belies his contention of impulsiveness.\n\n             We review a district court’s finding of more than\n\nminimal planning for clear error, reversing it only if \"we are\n\nleft with 'the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has\n\nbeen committed.\"           United States v. Rust, 976 F.2d 55, 57 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (quoting United States v. Vega-Encarnacion, 914 F.2d\n\n20, 24 (1st Cir. 1990)) (vacating a sentence, despite this\n\nstandard, where the district judge should have made the upward\n\nadjustment and did not do so); United States v. Gregorio, 956\n\nF.2d   341,    343        (1st   Cir.     1992)       (upholding      the   two-level\n\nenhancement).\n\n             Application         Note   1(f)     of    §    1B1.1   describes   three\n\ncircumstances        to    which    the     \"more          than   minimal   planning\"\n\nenhancement applies: 1) where the amount of planning involved\n\nexceeded that which \"is typical for commission of the offense in\n\na simple form;\" 2) where the defendant has taken significant\n\naffirmative steps to conceal the offense; and 3) where the\n\noffense involved \"repeated acts over a period of time, unless it\n\nis   clear    that    each       instance      was    purely      opportune.\"     The\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fgovernment     argues,     and    the   district   court   appears   to    have\n\ndetermined, that any one of these three justifications for the\n\nenhancement      applies     to    Chapman's     actions   because    of    the\n\ncomplexity of the scheme.5          While we are not convinced that the\n\nfacts here suggest more planning than is typical for bank fraud,\n\nwhich by its nature requires some sophistication, United States\n\nv. Bean, 18 F.3d 1367, 1370 (7th Cir. 1994), it seems quite\n\nevident that Chapman’s repeated transactions at different bank\n\nbranches were not \"purely opportune.\"\n\n              \"Conduct is 'purely opportune' only if it is spur of\n\nthe moment conduct, intended to take advantage of a sudden\n\nopportunity.\"         Rust, 976 F.2d at 57.           Webster's Third New\n\nInternational Dictionary (1986) defines \"sudden\" as something\n\nthat \"occur[s] unexpectedly\" and \"without previous notice,\" and\n\nwhich   was    thus   \"not   foreseen      or   prepared   for,\"   such    as   a\n\nthundershower on a clear day.             Although Chapman obviously took\n\nadvantage of having recently obtained his employer's checks, and\n\n\n\n    5  Chapman deposited bad checks in different locations in\norder to support his withdrawals from the various branches of\namounts that were only briefly supported by these phantom\ndeposits. Determining the right amounts to deposit and withdraw\nas he went along required both planning and basic math.     The\ngovernment argues that this qualifies as more than minimal\nplanning.    It also reasons that efforts to conceal are\ndemonstrated by the use of different bank branches (to avoid\ncalling attention to himself), and finally that the series of\ntransactions was not \"purely opportune.\"\n\n                                        -11-\n\fit may seem unlikely that it occurred to him to engage in this\n\nscheme at any time prior to his taking the checks and leaving,\n\nit nonetheless took two days for him to complete the process of\n\ndeposits and withdrawals that were the basis of his bank fraud\n\ncharge.     These acts were not \"sudden\" in any sense.\n\n            Because of the myriad criminal opportunities that can\n\narise and the differing ways individuals might act upon them, we\n\nneed not set forth an exact period of time, after an opportunity\n\npresents itself, within which one must act in order to have\n\nactions defined as \"purely opportune.\"            Chapman's actions were\n\nnot   \"purely   opportune,\"   and    the    enhancement      for   more   than\n\nminimal planning was      not clearly erroneous.\n\n                         IV. UPWARD DEPARTURE\n\n            Chapman next argues that it was error for the district\n\ncourt to depart upward from the guideline sentencing range on\n\nthe basis of his long criminal history.               U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3.      He\n\ncontends that the district court did not supply an adequate\n\nrationale    for   its   decision    to    do   so,    but   rather   made    a\n\nmechanical leap through the sentencing grid on the basis of\n\nnumbers alone.     Having reviewed the sentencing transcript, we\n\nfind this contention to be without merit.\n\n            Section 4A1.3 provides, in pertinent part: \"If reliable\n\ninformation indicates that the criminal history category does\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fnot adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past\n\ncriminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will\n\ncommit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence\n\ndeparting from the otherwise applicable guideline range.\"             In\n\nmost   cases,   this   means   that   the   court   should   apply   the\n\nsentencing guideline range that would result from the next\n\nhigher criminal history category, or from whichever category the\n\ndefendant best fits after considering the seriousness of his\n\ncumulative offenses.     U.S.S.G. § 4A1.3.     Because Category VI is\n\nthe highest contemplated by the grid, the Commission addressed\n\nthis problem in the following way:\n\n          [T]here may, on occasion, be a case of an\n          egregious, serious criminal record in which\n          even the guideline range for Criminal\n          History Category VI is not adequate to\n          reflect the seriousness of the defendant's\n          criminal history.     In such a case, a\n          departure above the guideline range for a\n          defendant with Criminal History Category VI\n          may be warranted. In determining whether an\n          upward departure from Criminal History\n          Category VI is warranted, the court should\n          consider that the nature of the prior\n          offenses rather than simply their number is\n          often more indicative of the seriousness of\n          the defendant's criminal record. . . .\n          Where the court determines that the extent\n          and nature of the defendant's criminal\n          history, taken together, are sufficient to\n          warrant an upward departure from Criminal\n          History Category VI, the court should\n          structure    the   departure    by   moving\n          incrementally down the sentencing table to\n          the next higher offense level in Criminal\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\f             History Category VI until it finds                           a\n             guideline range appropriate to the case.\n\nU.S.S.G.     §    4A1.3.      In     other    words,     when    the   court    cannot\n\nincrease the criminal history category (because there is none\n\nhigher), but would otherwise be justified in so doing, it may\n\ninstead adjust upward the offense level in order to arrive at an\n\nappropriate sentence.\n\n             Although Chapman devotes barely over one page in his\n\nbrief to this entire issue, and does not cite to the guideline\n\nlanguage, his arguments appear to be based primarily on the\n\nabove quoted text.            In essence, he contends that the court\n\nshould have considered the nature and context of his crimes, and\n\nnot just their number.\n\n             We have consistently followed a tripartite methodology\n\nfor analyzing upward departures originally chiseled in United\n\nStates v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 1989).                           That\n\nmethodology requires that we apply a different standard of\n\nreview to each step in the process.                  We look first at the legal\n\njustification for departure, in the abstract, using a de novo\n\nstandard.        Id.    Secondly, and assuming that we are satisfied\n\nwith   the       district     court's        interpretation       of   the     law     as\n\nconsidered       in    step   one,    we     look   at   the    factual   record      to\n\nascertain whether there are circumstances sufficient to warrant\n\nthe departure in the case at hand.                       Id.    Because this is a\n\n                                           -14-\n\fquestion of fact, we leave the district court's determination of\n\nthe matter untouched absent clear error.          Id.    Assuming, after\n\nthe first two steps, that we are still satisfied with the\n\nconclusions reached below, we look finally at the extent of the\n\ndeparture.    Id.     The standard we use at this stage is one of\n\nreasonableness.       Id.\n\n            The first two prongs of the test are quite simple in\n\nthe present case, and thus may be dispensed with quickly.            Based\n\non the section of the Sentencing Guidelines discussed above,\n\nthere is no question that an egregious criminal history, not\n\nproperly accounted for under the Guideline structure, is a\n\nproper legal ground for an upward departure.            It is also quite\n\nclear from the record that Chapman's criminal history is indeed\n\noverwhelming.     Not only did he have 36 criminal history points\n\n(which, on a scale that goes up to 13, certainly is extreme),\n\nbut his recidivism was nearly always immediate, and some of his\n\ncrimes were violent (burglary, which is deemed a violent crime\n\nby the Guidelines because of the potential for injury if there\n\nis an encounter with the resident).         The district court noted\n\nthat Chapman's was \"amazingly one of the worst record[s] I have\n\nseen in recent years,\" and we defer to that assessment in light\n\nof   the   district    court's   more   direct   experience   with    this\n\ndefendant and those with whom he is now compared.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f                Chapman’s real point of contention in this appeal goes\n\nto the third         Diaz-Villafane prong.                Under the Guidelines, a\n\nsentencing judge is expected to articulate some rationale for\n\nboth the departure itself and the extent of that departure.\n\nUnited States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 336 (1st Cir. 1990).                            As\n\ndiscussed above, Chapman's sentence of 32 months reflects a\n\nfive-month        departure     from    the     21-27      month    guideline   range.\n\nChapman contends that the district court made a mechanical move\n\nthrough the guideline grid based purely on his criminal history\n\nscore, but without considering the context of his past behavior\n\nand without providing adequate reasoning for its decision to add\n\nfive months specifically.\n\n                \"Reasonableness is a concept, not a constant,\" id., and\n\n\"[t]here is no scientifically precise litmus test by which the\n\nreasonableness of departure decisions can be resolved,\" id. at\n\n337.   Because we cannot create bright-line rules for this aspect\n\nof   the    sentencing         process,    we      give    substantial       leeway    to\n\ndistrict        courts    in    their   efforts       to    determine    the    proper\n\nsentence for a particular defendant.                       See Diaz-Villafane, 874\n\nF.2d       at     49-50    (\"This       third        step     involves        what     is\n\nquintessentially a judgment call . . . . We will not lightly\n\ndisturb     decisions      to    depart,      or    not,    or     related   decisions\n\nimplicating         degrees       of      departure.\").              Although        some\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fjustification is required, \"[w]e do not think that a district\n\ncourt     must   dissect       its   departure   decision,       explaining      in\n\nmathematical       or    pseudo-mathematical      terms       each    microscopic\n\nchoice made in arriving at the precise sentence.\"                    United States\n\nv. Emery, 991 F.2d 907, 913 (1st Cir. 1993).                          Indeed, the\n\ndistrict court's reasoning for whether to depart often can be\n\napplied, without further discussion, to the determination of the\n\nextent of that departure, at least in § 4A1.3 cases.                            Id.\n\n(\"[W]hen the court has provided a reasoned justification for its\n\ndecision to depart, and that statement constitutes an adequate\n\nsummary     from    which      an    appellate   tribunal      can     gauge    the\n\nreasonableness of the departure's extent, it has no obligation\n\nto   go   further       and   attempt   to   quantify   the    impact     of   each\n\nincremental factor on the departure sentence.\").\n\n            This case is similar, on this particular issue, to\n\nUnited States v. Black, 78 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1996), in which\n\nwe dealt with the following circumstances:\n\n            Black says that the district court acted\n            mechanically,    imposing   the    departure\n            basically because Black had far more points\n            than the minimum for category VI. This is\n            not a complete description of what happened:\n            the district judge mentioned the point\n            differential but followed this with a\n            lengthy   recitation   of   Black's   actual\n            criminal history, which we have already\n            quoted.\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fThis is precisely what happened in the instant case.                                The\n\ndistrict court noted the excessive criminal history points, but\n\nalso expressed concern about the violent nature of burglaries,\n\nas well as Chapman's consistent recidivism.                    As we stated in\n\nBlack, \"we will not remand for an explanation that is so clearly\n\nimplicit in what the district court found.\"                   Id. at 9.        Thus,\n\nthe    district      court    provided    adequate     reasoning         for   us    to\n\nconsider in determining the reasonableness of the departure's\n\nextent.\n\n             The extent of the departure in this case is relatively\n\nminor.       Chapman's       sentence    was    increased     by   5     months,     or\n\napproximately eighteen percent.                Compared with our prior cases\n\naffirming upward departures, the upward departure was modest.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 31 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (affirming an upward departure of 22 months, or about 50%,\n\non    the   basis    of   uncounted     prior    convictions       and    uncharged\n\ndomestic violence); United States v. Hardy, 99 F.3d 1242, 1253\n\n(1st Cir. 1996) (affirming a 300% upward departure); Black, 78\n\nF.3d at 7-8 (affirming an upward departure of 16 months, or\n\nabout 30%, on the basis of a criminal history score of 21);\n\nUnited      States   v.   Doe,   18     F.3d    41,   48-49   (1st     Cir.    1994)\n\n(affirming an upward departure of 45 months, or about 167%);\n\nEmery, 991 F.2d at 914 (affirming an upward departure of 21\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fmonths, or about 41%, on the basis of a criminal history score\n\nof 20); United States v. Brown, 899 F.2d 94, 96 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(affirming an upward departure of 12 months, or about 133%, on\n\nthe basis of a criminal history score of 20); Diaz-Villafane,\n\n874 F.2d at 51-52 (affirming an upward departure of 87 months,\n\nor 264%).\n\n            We    find   no   error   in   the   court’s   upward     departure\n\ndetermination.\n\n                                V. CONCLUSION\n\n            For    the   foregoing     reasons,     the    district    court's\n\nsentencing decisions are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\f",

McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Jay P. McCloskey, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Torruella, Chief Judge, Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge, and Stahl, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">STAHL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These consolidated appeals result from two sentences imposed upon Scott R. Chapman by the United States District Court for the District of Maine (Carter, J.). On appeal, Chapman raises three issues. First, he argues that it was error to impose his sentences consecutively rather than concurrently. Second, he disputes the two-level enhancement to his offense level for more than minimal planning. Finally, he contends that the imposition of a five-month upward departure from the sentencing guideline range, levied on the basis of his excessive criminal history, was unreasonable. Finding no error in any of these decisions, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the events relevant to this appeal, Chapman, a career criminal, was on supervised release following his most recent incarceration. Among the conditions to which he was subject were: 1) that he not leave the judicial district without permission; 2) that he not commit another federal, state, or local crime; and 3) that he abstain from all drug and alcohol use and participate in a drug and alcohol therapy program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Chapman violated all three of these conditions within his first few months of freedom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 9, 1999, as a result of an error on the part of the Bureau of Prisons which kept Chapman incarcerated 104 days longer than required, he was released from prison suddenly and without notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Using the $69 given to him as \"gate money\" upon release, he purchased a bus ticket that eventually brought him to Portland, Maine. After arriving there without funds and with no place to live, Chapman fortuitously found employment and housing with John Jollatta, a contractor who gave him work and allowed him to live at his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after he began work, Chapman, on two separate occasions, suffered work-related injuries. After his second injury Chapman was hospitalized. Jollatta visited him at the hospital and asked him not to file a worker's compensation claim, offering instead to cover his medical expenses in exchange. Chapman agreed and, after he was released from the hospital, moved back in with Jollatta. Thereafter, when Jollatta did not immediately pay the medical bills, Chapman became angry and departed Jollatta's employment and home, taking with him the company's business checkbook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman had a savings account at People's Heritage Bank, which he had opened when he first became employed. This was also Jollatta's bank. On August 2 and 3, 1999, Chapman engaged in a check kiting scheme using the checks he had stolen from Jollatta by writing several checks to himself for varying amounts, and then depositing them to his account. Subsequently, during the two-day period and at four different branches of the bank, he either cashed the checks and/or made withdrawals from the amounts previously deposited into his account at the bank. He also wrote one check to a retail store. In this way, over the two-day period, Chapman defrauded People's Heritage of $11,405.96 before it discovered the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman was arrested on August 26, 1999, in Montpelier, Vermont. He attempted to escape from the arresting officers, but was caught. Subsequently, during a search of his residence, cocaine and illegal mushrooms were found. On January 18, 2000, Chapman pled guilty to violating the terms of his supervised release by committing a new federal crime and was sentenced to serve an additional 24 months as a result. Chapman does not appeal this sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, Chapman also pled guilty to a charge of bank fraud. The base offense level for this crime was 6. Three levels were added pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1)(D) for the amount of the bank's loss, two levels were added pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2) for more than minimal planning. Finally, and despite Chapman's demonstrated lack of remorse,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> two levels were subtracted pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a) for acceptance of responsibility because Chapman had confessed to the bank fraud charge. This resulted in a final offense level of 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman had an extremely long, continuous, and sometimes violent criminal history, including burglary while armed with a .25 caliber handgun. Thirty-three criminal history points were applied to Chapman as a result of his 13 convictions, as well as two points for committing the instant offense while on supervised release, and one point because the offense occurred within two years of his release from custody. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1. Chapman's total of 36 criminal history points was well beyond (nearly triple) the 13 points needed to place him in Criminal History Category VI, the highest category reflected in the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The combination of an offense level of 9 and a Criminal History Category VI resulted in a guideline sentencing range of 21 to 27 months. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5A (Sentencing Table). Pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, however, a sentencing judge may depart upward from a guideline sentencing range where the criminal history category inadequately reflects \"the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. Because of Chapman's egregious criminal record, as well as his notable recidivist tendencies, the district court sentenced him to 32 months for the bank fraud, only a five-month, or 18-19 percent, upward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court required that Chapman's 24-month sentence for revocation of supervised release and his 32-month sentence for bank fraud run consecutively rather than concurrently, resulting in a total prison term of 56 months. Chapman appeals the decision to run his sentences consecutively, the two-level adjustment for more than minimal planning, and the upward departure from the sentencing guideline range because of his underrepresented criminal history. None of the other sentencing determinations is challenged here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman argues that his sentences for bank fraud and for revocation of supervised release should have been imposed to run concurrently and not consecutively. However, Chapman not only fails to address the relevant guideline, but the argument he does make is without merit. He contends that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584(a), the district court has the discretion to impose either concurrent or consecutive sentences, and that in this case that discretion was abused when the district court did not consider the mitigating fact that his crime was a result of his sudden release from prison. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5G1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs whether a new sentence imposed upon a defendant already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment should run concurrently or consecutively to the existing term. Application Note 6 deals with revocations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that this application note,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> despite its use of \"should,\" is mandatory. United States v. Gondek, 65 F.3d 1, 3 (1st cir. 1995); see also United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 539-40 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"In cases where a defendant has committed a federal offense while on probation, Note 4 expressly limits a district court's discretion in determining a reasonable incremental punishment by providing that the court must order the entire federal sentence to run consecutively to any sentence imposed upon revocation of probation.\"). Several other circuits--nearly all of those addressing the issue--have agreed with this interpretation. See, e.g., United States v. Alexander, 100 F.3d 24, 26 (5th Cir. 1996) (holding that Application Note 6 is \"binding on the courts\"); United States v. Bernard, 48 F.3d 427, 430-32 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, and as the district court aptly noted, \"as a matter of fact or policy, the only way to effectively enforce supervised release is to require that time in addition to whatever else he is sentenced for is imposed.\" Otherwise, there effectively would be no punishment at all for violating the conditions of his supervised release. We can conceive of no reason to upset the district court's imposition of consecutive sentences for the revocation of supervised release and the bank fraud itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. MORE THAN MINIMAL PLANNING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman next argues that the district court erred in adjusting his offense level upward for more than minimal planning pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2). He contends that his actions were impulsive and opportunistic, and thus do not lend themselves to this enhancement. Even if we grant that his decision to abscond with the checks and run was spontaneous, however, the complicated process through which he negotiated the checks belies his contention of impulsiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's finding of more than minimal planning for clear error, reversing it only if \"we are left with 'the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" United States v. Rust, 976 F.2d 55, 57 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting United States v. Vega-Encarnacion, 914 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1990)) (vacating a sentence, despite this standard, where the district judge should have made the upward adjustment and did not do so); United States v. Gregorio, 956 F.2d 341, 343 (1st Cir. 1992) (upholding the two-level enhancement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application Note 1(f) of &#167; 1B1.1 describes three circumstances to which the \"more than minimal planning\" enhancement applies: 1) where the amount of planning involved exceeded that which \"is typical for commission of the offense in a simple form;\" 2) where the defendant has taken significant affirmative steps to conceal the offense; and 3) where the offense involved \"repeated acts over a period of time, unless it is clear that each instance was purely opportune.\" The government argues, and the district court appears to have determined, that any one of these three justifications for the enhancement applies to Chapman's actions because of the complexity of the scheme.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> While we are not convinced that the facts here suggest more planning than is typical for bank fraud, which by its nature requires some sophistication, United States v. Bean, 18 F.3d 1367, 1370 (7th Cir. 1994), it seems quite evident that Chapman's repeated transactions at different bank branches were not \"purely opportune.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Conduct is 'purely opportune' only if it is spur of the moment conduct, intended to take advantage of a sudden opportunity.\" Rust, 976 F.2d at 57. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1986) defines \"sudden\" as something that \"occur[s] unexpectedly\" and \"without previous notice,\" and which was thus \"not foreseen or prepared for,\" such as a thundershower on a clear day. Although Chapman obviously took advantage of having recently obtained his employer's checks, and it may seem unlikely that it occurred to him to engage in this scheme at any time prior to his taking the checks and leaving, it nonetheless took two days for him to complete the process of deposits and withdrawals that were the basis of his bank fraud charge. These acts were not \"sudden\" in any sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the myriad criminal opportunities that can arise and the differing ways individuals might act upon them, we need not set forth an exact period of time, after an opportunity presents itself, within which one must act in order to have actions defined as \"purely opportune.\" Chapman's actions were not \"purely opportune,\" and the enhancement for more than minimal planning was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. UPWARD DEPARTURE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman next argues that it was error for the district court to depart upward from the guideline sentencing range on the basis of his long criminal history. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. He contends that the district court did not supply an adequate rationale for its decision to do so, but rather made a mechanical leap through the sentencing grid on the basis of numbers alone. Having reviewed the sentencing transcript, we find this contention to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4A1.3 provides, in pertinent part: \"If reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range.\" In most cases, this means that the court should apply the sentencing guideline range that would result from the next higher criminal history category, or from whichever category the defendant best fits after considering the seriousness of his cumulative offenses. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. Because Category VI is the highest contemplated by the grid, the Commission addressed this problem in the following way:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for Criminal History Category VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history. In such a case, a departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal History Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant's criminal record. . . . Where the court determines that the extent and nature of the defendant's criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. In other words, when the court cannot increase the criminal history category (because there is none higher), but would otherwise be justified in so doing, it may instead adjust upward the offense level in order to arrive at an appropriate sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Chapman devotes barely over one page in his brief to this entire issue, and does not cite to the guideline language, his arguments appear to be based primarily on the above quoted text. In essence, he contends that the court should have considered the nature and context of his crimes, and not just their number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have consistently followed a tripartite methodology for analyzing upward departures originally chiseled in United States v. Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 1989). That methodology requires that we apply a different standard of review to each step in the process. We look first at the legal justification for departure, in the abstract, using a de novo standard. Id. Secondly, and assuming that we are satisfied with the district court's interpretation of the law as considered in step one, we look at the factual record to ascertain whether there are circumstances sufficient to warrant the departure in the case at hand. Id. Because this is a question of fact, we leave the district court's determination of the matter untouched absent clear error. Id. Assuming, after the first two steps, that we are still satisfied with the conclusions reached below, we look finally at the extent of the departure. Id. The standard we use at this stage is one of reasonableness. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two prongs of the test are quite simple in the present case, and thus may be dispensed with quickly. Based on the section of the Sentencing Guidelines discussed above, there is no question that an egregious criminal history, not properly accounted for under the Guideline structure, is a proper legal ground for an upward departure. It is also quite clear from the record that Chapman's criminal history is indeed overwhelming. Not only did he have 36 criminal history points (which, on a scale that goes up to 13, certainly is extreme), but his recidivism was nearly always immediate, and some of his crimes were violent (burglary, which is deemed a violent crime by the Guidelines because of the potential for injury if there is an encounter with the resident). The district court noted that Chapman's was \"amazingly one of the worst record[s] I have seen in recent years,\" and we defer to that assessment in light of the district court's more direct experience with this defendant and those with whom he is now compared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman's real point of contention in this appeal goes to the third Diaz-Villafane prong. Under the Guidelines, a sentencing judge is expected to articulate some rationale for both the departure itself and the extent of that departure. United States v. Ocasio, 914 F.2d 330, 336 (1st Cir. 1990). As discussed above, Chapman's sentence of 32 months reflects a five-month departure from the 21-27 month guideline range. Chapman contends that the district court made a mechanical move through the guideline grid based purely on his criminal history score, but without considering the context of his past behavior and without providing adequate reasoning for its decision to add five months specifically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Reasonableness is a concept, not a constant,\" id., and \"[t]here is no scientifically precise litmus test by which the reasonableness of departure decisions can be resolved,\" id. at 337. Because we cannot create bright-line rules for this aspect of the sentencing process, we give substantial leeway to district courts in their efforts to determine the proper sentence for a particular defendant. See Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 49-50 (\"This third step involves what is quintessentially a judgment call . . . . We will not lightly disturb decisions to depart, or not, or related decisions implicating degrees of departure.\"). Although some justification is required, \"[w]e do not think that a district court must dissect its departure decision, explaining in mathematical or pseudo-mathematical terms each microscopic choice made in arriving at the precise sentence.\" United States v. Emery, 991 F.2d 907, 913 (1st Cir. 1993). Indeed, the district court's reasoning for whether to depart often can be applied, without further discussion, to the determination of the extent of that departure, at least in &#167; 4A1.3 cases. Id. (\"[W]hen the court has provided a reasoned justification for its decision to depart, and that statement constitutes an adequate summary from which an appellate tribunal can gauge the reasonableness of the departure's extent, it has no obligation to go further and attempt to quantify the impact of each incremental factor on the departure sentence.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is similar, on this particular issue, to United States v. Black, 78 F.3d 1, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1996), in which we dealt with the following circumstances:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Black says that the district court acted mechanically, imposing the departure basically because Black had far more points than the minimum for category VI. This is not a complete description of what happened: the district judge mentioned the point differential but followed this with a lengthy recitation of Black's actual criminal history, which we have already quoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is precisely what happened in the instant case. The district court noted the excessive criminal history points, but also expressed concern about the violent nature of burglaries, as well as Chapman's consistent recidivism. As we stated in Black, \"we will not remand for an explanation that is so clearly implicit in what the district court found.\" Id. at 9. Thus, the district court provided adequate reasoning for us to consider in determining the reasonableness of the departure's extent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The extent of the departure in this case is relatively minor. Chapman's sentence was increased by 5 months, or approximately eighteen percent. Compared with our prior cases affirming upward departures, the upward departure was modest. See, e.g., United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d 22, 31 (1st Cir. 1997) (affirming an upward departure of 22 months, or about 50%, on the basis of uncounted prior convictions and uncharged domestic violence); United States v. Hardy, 99 F.3d 1242, 1253 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming a 300% upward departure); Black, 78 F.3d at 7-8 (affirming an upward departure of 16 months, or about 30%, on the basis of a criminal history score of 21); United States v. Doe, 18 F.3d 41, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1994) (affirming an upward departure of 45 months, or about 167%); Emery, 991 F.2d at 914 (affirming an upward departure of 21 months, or about 41%, on the basis of a criminal history score of 20); United States v. Brown, 899 F.2d 94, 96 (1st Cir. 1990) (affirming an upward departure of 12 months, or about 133%, on the basis of a criminal history score of 20); Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 51-52 (affirming an upward departure of 87 months, or 264%).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the court's upward departure determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V.

Chapman by the United States District Court for the District of Maine (Carter, J.). On appeal, Chapman raises three issues. First, he argues that it was error to impose his sentences consecutively rather than concurrently. Second, he disputes the two-level enhancement to his offense level for more than minimal planning. Finally, he contends that the imposition of a five-month upward departure from the sentencing guideline range, levied on the basis of his excessive criminal history, was unreasonable. Finding no error in any of these decisions, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the events relevant to this appeal, Chapman, a career criminal, was on supervised release following his most recent incarceration. Among the conditions to which he was subject were: 1) that he not leave the judicial district without permission; 2) that he not commit another federal, state, or local crime; and 3) that he abstain from all drug and alcohol use and participate in a drug and alcohol therapy program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Chapman violated all three of these conditions within his first few months of freedom.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 9, 1999, as a result of an error on the part of the Bureau of Prisons which kept Chapman incarcerated 104 days longer than required, he was released from prison suddenly and without notice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Using the $69 given to him as \"gate money\" upon release, he purchased a bus ticket that eventually brought him to Portland, Maine. After arriving there without funds and with no place to live, Chapman fortuitously found employment and housing with John Jollatta, a contractor who gave him work and allowed him to live at his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after he began work, Chapman, on two separate occasions, suffered work-related injuries. After his second injury Chapman was hospitalized. Jollatta visited him at the hospital and asked him not to file a worker's compensation claim, offering instead to cover his medical expenses in exchange. Chapman agreed and, after he was released from the hospital, moved back in with Jollatta. Thereafter, when Jollatta did not immediately pay the medical bills, Chapman became angry and departed Jollatta's employment and home, taking with him the company's business checkbook.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman had a savings account at People's Heritage Bank, which he had opened when he first became employed. This was also Jollatta's bank. On August 2 and 3, 1999, Chapman engaged in a check kiting scheme using the checks he had stolen from Jollatta by writing several checks to himself for varying amounts, and then depositing them to his account. Subsequently, during the two-day period and at four different branches of the bank, he either cashed the checks and/or made withdrawals from the amounts previously deposited into his account at the bank. He also wrote one check to a retail store. In this way, over the two-day period, Chapman defrauded People's Heritage of $11,405.96 before it discovered the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman was arrested on August 26, 1999, in Montpelier, Vermont. He attempted to escape from the arresting officers, but was caught. Subsequently, during a search of his residence, cocaine and illegal mushrooms were found. On January 18, 2000, Chapman pled guilty to violating the terms of his supervised release by committing a new federal crime and was sentenced to serve an additional 24 months as a result. Chapman does not appeal this sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the same day, Chapman also pled guilty to a charge of bank fraud. The base offense level for this crime was 6. Three levels were added pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1)(D) for the amount of the bank's loss, two levels were added pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2) for more than minimal planning. Finally, and despite Chapman's demonstrated lack of remorse,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> two levels were subtracted pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1(a) for acceptance of responsibility because Chapman had confessed to the bank fraud charge. This resulted in a final offense level of 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman had an extremely long, continuous, and sometimes violent criminal history, including burglary while armed with a .25 caliber handgun. Thirty-three criminal history points were applied to Chapman as a result of his 13 convictions, as well as two points for committing the instant offense while on supervised release, and one point because the offense occurred within two years of his release from custody. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.1. Chapman's total of 36 criminal history points was well beyond (nearly triple) the 13 points needed to place him in Criminal History Category VI, the highest category reflected in the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The combination of an offense level of 9 and a Criminal History Category VI resulted in a guideline sentencing range of 21 to 27 months. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5A (Sentencing Table). Pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3, however, a sentencing judge may depart upward from a guideline sentencing range where the criminal history category inadequately reflects \"the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. Because of Chapman's egregious criminal record, as well as his notable recidivist tendencies, the district court sentenced him to 32 months for the bank fraud, only a five-month, or 18-19 percent, upward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court required that Chapman's 24-month sentence for revocation of supervised release and his 32-month sentence for bank fraud run consecutively rather than concurrently, resulting in a total prison term of 56 months. Chapman appeals the decision to run his sentences consecutively, the two-level adjustment for more than minimal planning, and the upward departure from the sentencing guideline range because of his underrepresented criminal history. None of the other sentencing determinations is challenged here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. CONSECUTIVE SENTENCES</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman argues that his sentences for bank fraud and for revocation of supervised release should have been imposed to run concurrently and not consecutively. However, Chapman not only fails to address the relevant guideline, but the argument he does make is without merit. He contends that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3584(a), the district court has the discretion to impose either concurrent or consecutive sentences, and that in this case that discretion was abused when the district court did not consider the mitigating fact that his crime was a result of his sudden release from prison. We do not agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5G1.3 of the Sentencing Guidelines governs whether a new sentence imposed upon a defendant already subject to an undischarged term of imprisonment should run concurrently or consecutively to the existing term. Application Note 6 deals with revocations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the defendant was on federal or state probation, parole, or supervised release at the time of the instant offense, and has had such probation, parole, or supervised release revoked, the sentence for the instant offense should be imposed to run consecutively to the term imposed for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release in order to provide an incremental penalty for the violation of probation, parole, or supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have held that this application note,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> despite its use of \"should,\" is mandatory.

Several other circuits--nearly all of those addressing the issue--have agreed with this interpretation. See, e.g., United States v. Alexander, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729664\"><a href=\"/opinion/729664/united-states-v-stanley-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 26 (5th Cir. 1996) (holding that Application Note 6 is \"binding on the courts\"); United States v. Bernard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689984\"><a href=\"/opinion/689984/united-states-v-richard-ryerson-bernard/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 430-32 (9th Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, and as the district court aptly noted, \"as a matter of fact or policy, the only way to effectively enforce supervised release is to require that time in addition to whatever else he is sentenced for is imposed.\" Otherwise, there effectively would be no punishment at all for violating the conditions of his supervised release. We can conceive of no reason to upset the district court's imposition of consecutive sentences for the revocation of supervised release and the bank fraud itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. MORE THAN MINIMAL PLANNING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman next argues that the district court erred in adjusting his offense level upward for more than minimal planning pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(2). He contends that his actions were impulsive and opportunistic, and thus do not lend themselves to this enhancement. Even if we grant that his decision to abscond with the checks and run was spontaneous, however, the complicated process through which he negotiated the checks belies his contention of impulsiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's finding of more than minimal planning for clear error, reversing it only if \"we are left with 'the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\" United States v.

Bean, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664925\"><a href=\"/opinion/664925/united-states-of-america-cross-appellee-v-bill-gene-bean/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1367</span></a></span>, 1370 (7th Cir. 1994), it seems quite evident that Chapman's repeated transactions at different bank branches were not \"purely opportune.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Conduct is 'purely opportune' only if it is spur of the moment conduct, intended to take advantage of a sudden opportunity.\" Rust, 976 F.2d at 57. Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1986) defines \"sudden\" as something that \"occur[s] unexpectedly\" and \"without previous notice,\" and which was thus \"not foreseen or prepared for,\" such as a thundershower on a clear day. Although Chapman obviously took advantage of having recently obtained his employer's checks, and it may seem unlikely that it occurred to him to engage in this scheme at any time prior to his taking the checks and leaving, it nonetheless took two days for him to complete the process of deposits and withdrawals that were the basis of his bank fraud charge. These acts were not \"sudden\" in any sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because of the myriad criminal opportunities that can arise and the differing ways individuals might act upon them, we need not set forth an exact period of time, after an opportunity presents itself, within which one must act in order to have actions defined as \"purely opportune.\" Chapman's actions were not \"purely opportune,\" and the enhancement for more than minimal planning was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. UPWARD DEPARTURE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman next argues that it was error for the district court to depart upward from the guideline sentencing range on the basis of his long criminal history. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. He contends that the district court did not supply an adequate rationale for its decision to do so, but rather made a mechanical leap through the sentencing grid on the basis of numbers alone. Having reviewed the sentencing transcript, we find this contention to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 4A1.3 provides, in pertinent part: \"If reliable information indicates that the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of the defendant's past criminal conduct or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, the court may consider imposing a sentence departing from the otherwise applicable guideline range.\" In most cases, this means that the court should apply the sentencing guideline range that would result from the next higher criminal history category, or from whichever category the defendant best fits after considering the seriousness of his cumulative offenses. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. Because Category VI is the highest contemplated by the grid, the Commission addressed this problem in the following way:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here may, on occasion, be a case of an egregious, serious criminal record in which even the guideline range for Criminal History Category VI is not adequate to reflect the seriousness of the defendant's criminal history. In such a case, a departure above the guideline range for a defendant with Criminal History Category VI may be warranted. In determining whether an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI is warranted, the court should consider that the nature of the prior offenses rather than simply their number is often more indicative of the seriousness of the defendant's criminal record. . . . Where the court determines that the extent and nature of the defendant's criminal history, taken together, are sufficient to warrant an upward departure from Criminal History Category VI, the court should structure the departure by moving incrementally down the sentencing table to the next higher offense level in Criminal History Category VI until it finds a guideline range appropriate to the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.3. In other words, when the court cannot increase the criminal history category (because there is none higher), but would otherwise be justified in so doing, it may instead adjust upward the offense level in order to arrive at an appropriate sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Chapman devotes barely over one page in his brief to this entire issue, and does not cite to the guideline language, his arguments appear to be based primarily on the above quoted text. In essence, he contends that the court should have considered the nature and context of his crimes, and not just their number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have consistently followed a tripartite methodology for analyzing upward departures originally chiseled in United States v. Diaz-Villafane, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522865\"><a href=\"/opinion/522865/united-states-v-wilfredo-diaz-villafane/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir. 1989). That methodology requires that we apply a different standard of review to each step in the process. We look first at the legal justification for departure, in the abstract, using a de novo standard. Id. Secondly, and assuming that we are satisfied with the district court's interpretation of the law as considered in step one, we look at the factual record to ascertain whether there are circumstances sufficient to warrant the departure in the case at hand. Id. Because this is a question of fact, we leave the district court's determination of the matter untouched absent clear error. Id. Assuming, after the first two steps, that we are still satisfied with the conclusions reached below, we look finally at the extent of the departure. Id. The standard we use at this stage is one of reasonableness. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two prongs of the test are quite simple in the present case, and thus may be dispensed with quickly. Based on the section of the Sentencing Guidelines discussed above, there is no question that an egregious criminal history, not properly accounted for under the Guideline structure, is a proper legal ground for an upward departure. It is also quite clear from the record that Chapman's criminal history is indeed overwhelming. Not only did he have 36 criminal history points (which, on a scale that goes up to 13, certainly is extreme), but his recidivism was nearly always immediate, and some of his crimes were violent (burglary, which is deemed a violent crime by the Guidelines because of the potential for injury if there is an encounter with the resident). The district court noted that Chapman's was \"amazingly one of the worst record[s] I have seen in recent years,\" and we defer to that assessment in light of the district court's more direct experience with this defendant and those with whom he is now compared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman's real point of contention in this appeal goes to the third Diaz-Villafane prong. Under the Guidelines, a sentencing judge is expected to articulate some rationale for both the departure itself and the extent of that departure. United States v. Ocasio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548346\"><a href=\"/opinion/548346/united-states-v-gilberto-ocasio-aka-gilberto-ocasio-agosto/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span>, 336 (1st Cir. 1990). As discussed above, Chapman's sentence of 32 months reflects a five-month departure from the 21-27 month guideline range. Chapman contends that the district court made a mechanical move through the guideline grid based purely on his criminal history score, but without considering the context of his past behavior and without providing adequate reasoning for its decision to add five months specifically.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Reasonableness is a concept, not a constant,\" id., and \"[t]here is no scientifically precise litmus test by which the reasonableness of departure decisions can be resolved,\" id. at 337. Because we cannot create bright-line rules for this aspect of the sentencing process, we give substantial leeway to district courts in their efforts to determine the proper sentence for a particular defendant. See Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 49-50 (\"This third step involves what is quintessentially a judgment call . . . . We will not lightly disturb decisions to depart, or not, or related decisions implicating degrees of departure.\"). Although some justification is required, \"[w]e do not think that a district court must dissect its departure decision, explaining in mathematical or pseudo-mathematical terms each microscopic choice made in arriving at the precise sentence.\" United States v. Emery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605526\"><a href=\"/opinion/605526/united-states-v-charles-e-emery/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 913 (1st Cir. 1993). Indeed, the district court's reasoning for whether to depart often can be applied, without further discussion, to the determination of the extent of that departure, at least in &#167; 4A1.3 cases. Id. (\"[W]hen the court has provided a reasoned justification for its decision to depart, and that statement constitutes an adequate summary from which an appellate tribunal can gauge the reasonableness of the departure's extent, it has no obligation to go further and attempt to quantify the impact of each incremental factor on the departure sentence.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is similar, on this particular issue, to United States v. Black, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196600\"><a href=\"/opinion/196600/united-states-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8-9 (1st Cir. 1996), in which we dealt with the following circumstances:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Black says that the district court acted mechanically, imposing the departure basically because Black had far more points than the minimum for category VI. This is not a complete description of what happened: the district judge mentioned the point differential but followed this with a lengthy recitation of Black's actual criminal history, which we have already quoted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is precisely what happened in the instant case. The district court noted the excessive criminal history points, but also expressed concern about the violent nature of burglaries, as well as Chapman's consistent recidivism. As we stated in Black, \"we will not remand for an explanation that is so clearly implicit in what the district court found.\" Id. at 9. Thus, the district court provided adequate reasoning for us to consider in determining the reasonableness of the departure's extent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The extent of the departure in this case is relatively minor. Chapman's sentence was increased by 5 months, or approximately eighteen percent. Compared with our prior cases affirming upward departures, the upward departure was modest. See, e.g., United States v. Brewster, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197582\"><a href=\"/opinion/197582/united-states-v-brewster/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir. 1997) (affirming an upward departure of 22 months, or about 50%, on the basis of uncounted prior convictions and uncharged domestic violence); United States v. Hardy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197072\"><a href=\"/opinion/197072/united-states-v-hardy/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1242</span></a></span>, 1253 (1st Cir. 1996) (affirming a 300% upward departure); Black, 78 F.3d at 7-8 (affirming an upward departure of 16 months, or about 30%, on the basis of a criminal history score of 21); United States v. Doe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195243\"><a href=\"/opinion/195243/united-states-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 48-49 (1st Cir. 1994) (affirming an upward departure of 45 months, or about 167%); Emery, 991 F.2d at 914 (affirming an upward departure of 21 months, or about 41%, on the basis of a criminal history score of 20); United States v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538793\"><a href=\"/opinion/538793/united-states-v-richard-c-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 96 (1st Cir. 1990) (affirming an upward departure of 12 months, or about 133%, on the basis of a criminal history score of 20); Diaz-Villafane, 874 F.2d at 51-52 (affirming an upward departure of 87 months, or 264%).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find no error in the court's upward departure determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court's sentencing decisions are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> These numbers differ from the original numbering of the conditions, as they reflect only those conditions relevant here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This extra time served, however, is not relevant to the determination of his sentences in this case. The Bureau of Prisons will automatically deduct it from the time he now must serve for revocation of his supervised release.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Chapman still appears to believe that he was entitled to do what he did because Jollatta had not paid his medical bills.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> At the time of our holdings in Gondek and McCarthy, this identical note was identified as Application Note 4.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Chapman deposited bad checks in different locations in order to support his withdrawals from the various branches of amounts that were only briefly supported by these phantom deposits. Determining the right amounts to deposit and withdraw as he went along required both planning and basic math. The government argues that this qualifies as more than minimal planning. It also reasons that efforts to conceal are demonstrated by the use of different bank branches (to avoid calling attention to himself), and finally that the series of transactions was not \"purely opportune.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
