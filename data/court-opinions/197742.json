The defendant asserted that the two\r\n\nforms of cocaine should have been  separated prior to calculating\r\n\nthe offense level.   The sentencing court disagreed  and we agree\r\n\nwith the sentencing court and thus affirm.\r\n\n          The  defendant  was  charged   in  an  indictment  with\r\n\npossession  with intent  to deliver  cocaine in  violation of  21\r\n\nU.S.C.   841(a)(1).   He entered a plea of  guilty.  On June  28,\r\n\n1996, Providence Rhode  Island police officers executed  a search\r\n\nwarrant at  the  defendant s home  and  seized three  bags,  each\r\n\ncontaining cocaine powder and  cocaine base.  The total  combined\r\n\nweight of powder and cocaine base was 123.4 grams.  Additionally,\r\n\nthe  police discovered a separate container containing 7.43 grams\r\n\nof crack cocaine.1  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  The  defendant entered his plea of guilty on December 6, 1996.\r\nThe United States  Attorney recited the factual basis  in part as\r\nfollows:\r\n\n          . . . that on June 28, 1996, at approximately\r\n          6:00   p.m.,   Providence   police   officers\r\n          executed a search  warrant at  a first  floor\r\n          apartment . .  . which  was the  home of  the\r\n          defendant  Manuel Valerio.   At the  time the\r\n          officers executed the  warrant, the defendant\r\n          was  at home  . .  .  he was  advised of  his\r\n          Miranda  warning by  the officers.   At  that\r                           \r\n          time  he agreed  to show the  police officers\r\n          where the drugs  in his  house were  located.\r\n          He  led the officers to the master bedroom in\r\n          the apartment.  Under the bed he pulled out a\r\n          bag  of rice.  Examination of that bag showed\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          The  district  court  calculated the  defendant s  base\r\n\noffense level as  32 pursuant to   2D1.1(c)(4)  of the Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines  drug quantity table.2   The government argued and the\r\n\nsentencing court agreed  that Note A to    2D1.1(c) applied which\r\n\nindicates that if  a mixture or substance contains  more than one\r\n\ncontrolled  substance, \"the  weight  of  the  entire  mixture  or\r\n\nsubstance is assigned to the controlled substance that results in\r\n\nthe greater  offense level.\"   Consequently, the three  bags with\r\n\nweight of 123.4 grams  was treated as crack cocaine.3   The Court\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          that it contained  three plastic  bags.   The\r\n          plastic bags each contained a substance later\r\n          determined  in total to  be 123.4 grams  of a\r\n          mixture containing powder cocaine and cocaine\r\n          base  . .  . in  a  bedroom closet,  officers\r\n          seized  a baby  wipes container.   Inside  of\r\n          that were  two bags  of cut  and  also a  bag\r\n          containing 7.43 grams of cocaine base.  \r\n\n          The defendant  agreed with the  above factual\r\n          basis.  \r\n\n2   This  subsection applies  to offenses  involving at  least 50\r\ngrams, but less than 150 grams of crack cocaine.  \r\n\n3  Prior  to sentencing, the defendant moved  for the opportunity\r\nto  have a  forensic  chemist separate  and  measure the  cocaine\r\npowder and the cocaine base.   The motion was unopposed. However,\r\nthe defendant did not follow up on the request.  Nonetheless, the\r\ndefendant  argues that had  the crack cocaine  been isolated from\r\nthe  cocaine powder, the resulting  base offense level would have\r\nbeen 26, with a net offense level of 25, which when combined with\r\nthe defendant's Criminal History of II, would have provided for a\r\nrange of 63-78 months.  In order  to lower the base offense level\r\nto 26,  the weight of the  separated cocaine base,  when added to\r\nthe 7.43 grams  of crack cocaine in the  separate container would\r\nhave to have  been less  than 12.57  grams of cocaine  base as   \r\n2D1.1(c)(7) provides  for a  base offense level  of 26  where the\r\ncrack  cocaine is not more than  20 grams.  It  is not clear from\r\nthe record as  to why counsel  for the defendant  is of the  view\r\nthat the \"separated\" crack cocaine  in the three containers would\r\nhave weighed less than 12.57 grams.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nfound  that the  offense level was  31 with a  Guideline Range of\r\n\n121-151  months by assessing a two  level increase for possession\r\n\nof  a  firearm and  a  three  level  decrease for  acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility.  \r\n\n          The  government moved for a downward departure based on\r\n\nsubstantial  assistance (   5K1.1)  and  the  Court  reduced  the\r\n\nsentence below the mandatory  minimum to a term of 60 months from\r\n\nwhich the defendant now appeals.4  \r\n\n          The  emerging issues in  determining the weight  of the\r\n\noffending  controlled substances5  was partially  responsible for\r\n\nthe subsequent amendment 484 to the Sentencing Guidelines  and in\r\n\nwhich the  defendant takes comfort  in this case.   Amendment 484\r\n\nwhich  became  effective   November  1,  1993  and   amended  the\r\n\ncommentary to   2D1.1 by deleting \"21 U.S.C.   841\" and inserting\r\n\nin lieu thereof:\r\n\n          \"21  U.S.C.      841,  except   as  expressly\r\n          provided.    Mixture  or  substance does  not\r\n          include materials that must be separated from\r\n          the   controlled    substance   before    the\r\n          controlled substance can  be used.   Examples\r\n          of such materials include the fiberglass in a\r\n          cocaine/fiberglass  bonded suitcase,  beeswax\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  The  defendant's sentencing range, prior to  departure was 121\r\nto 151 months.   The prosecution advocated a  seven year sentence\r\nand  the defendant  a three  year sentence.   The  district court\r\nindicated  it would,  in effect,  cut  the sentence  in half  and\r\nsentence  the defendant  to the  sixty-month  term.   Defendant's\r\ncounsel reasons that had the cocaine powder and cocaine base been\r\nseparated for sentencing purposes with a resulting range of 63 to\r\n78 months, cutting the sentence in  half would have resulted in a\r\n32 month sentence.  Hence, the appeal.  \r\n\n5   See United States  v. Mahecha-Onofre, 936  F.2d 623 (1st Cir.\r                                                  \r\n1991) and  United States  v. L pez-Gil, 965  F.2d 1124  (1st Cir.\r                                                \r\n1992).\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          in a cocaine/beeswax statute, and waste water\r\n          from   an   illicit    laboratory   used   to\r\n          manufacture a controlled substance.  If  such\r\n          material cannot readily be separated from the\r\n          mixture  or substance  that appropriately  is\r\n          counted in the Drug Quantity Table, the court\r\n          may use any  reasonable method to approximate\r\n          the  weight of the mixture or substance to be\r\n          counted.\r\n\n          An  upward   departure  nonetheless   may  be\r\n          warranted  when  the   mixture  or  substance\r\n          counted  in   the  Drug  Quantity   Table  is\r\n          combined with  other, non-countable  material\r\n          in an unusually sophisticated manner in order\r\n          to avoid detection.\".\r\n\n          It is without dispute that the defendant possessed with\r\n\nintent  to  distribute  a  substance  containing  two  controlled\r\n\nsubstances.  Nonetheless, because the two are not ingested in the\r\n\nsame manner, (the  powder is  inhaled  and the  crack  is smoked)\r\n\nthe  defendant argues  they  must  be  separated  for  sentencing\r\n\npurposes  in reliance  on the  Amended Commentary  to U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n2D1.1  as the  cocaine powder  and cocaine  base come  within the\r\n\nconcept of \"materials  that must be separated from the controlled\r\n\nsubstance before the controlled substance can be used.\"  However,\r\n\nas indicated in United States v.  Campbell, 61 F.3d 976, 982 (1st\r                                                    \r\n\nCir. 1995), cert. denied, 116  S. Ct. 1556 (1996) \"the commentary\r                                  \r\n\nexcludes only materials  that are unusable or  unmarketable, such\r\n\nas those  used to  transport the  controlled substance,  or waste\r\n\nproducts  that are discarded  before the controlled  substance is\r\n\nput  into the  distribution  chain.\"   (Citations  omitted).   As\r\n\nneither  the  cocaine  powder  or  cocaine  base  is unusable  or\r\n\nunmarketable,  the revisions  to the  commentary to  U.S.S.G.    \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n2D1.1  provided by  Amendment 484  are  of no  assistance to  the\r\n\ndefendant.6  \r\n\n          Accordingly, the district court's judgment is AFFIRMED.\r                                                                  AFFIRMED\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n6  Defendant's counsel, at the  sentencing hearing, advocated the\r\nseparation contending that finding the two substances together is\r\nillogical and went on to state that he could not explain  why the\r\ncocaine base  and cocaine  powder were mixed.   No  testimony was\r\noffered as to why they were mixed,  but in our view the motive or\r\nlack of motive for the mixture is not relevant.  \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n",

At  that\r                           \r\n          time  he agreed  to show the  police officers\r\n          where the drugs  in his  house were  located.\r\n          He  led the officers to the master bedroom in\r\n          the apartment.  Under the bed he pulled out a\r\n          bag  of rice.  Examination of that bag showed\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          The  district  court  calculated the  defendant s  base\r\n\noffense level as  32 pursuant to   2D1.1(c)(4)  of the Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines  drug quantity table.2   The government argued and the\r\n\nsentencing court agreed  that Note A to    2D1.1(c) applied which\r\n\nindicates that if  a mixture or substance contains  more than one\r\n\ncontrolled  substance, \"the  weight  of  the  entire  mixture  or\r\n\nsubstance is assigned to the controlled substance that results in\r\n\nthe greater  offense level.\"   Consequently, the three  bags with\r\n\nweight of 123.4 grams  was treated as crack cocaine.3   The Court\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          that it contained  three plastic  bags.   The\r\n          plastic bags each contained a substance later\r\n          determined  in total to  be 123.4 grams  of a\r\n          mixture containing powder cocaine and cocaine\r\n          base  . .  . in  a  bedroom closet,  officers\r\n          seized  a baby  wipes container.   Inside  of\r\n          that were  two bags  of cut  and  also a  bag\r\n          containing 7.43 grams of cocaine base.  \r\n\n          The defendant  agreed with the  above factual\r\n          basis.  \r\n\n2   This  subsection applies  to offenses  involving at  least 50\r\ngrams, but less than 150 grams of crack cocaine.  \r\n\n3  Prior  to sentencing, the defendant moved  for the opportunity\r\nto  have a  forensic  chemist separate  and  measure the  cocaine\r\npowder and the cocaine base.   The motion was unopposed. However,\r\nthe defendant did not follow up on the request.  Nonetheless, the\r\ndefendant  argues that had  the crack cocaine  been isolated from\r\nthe  cocaine powder, the resulting  base offense level would have\r\nbeen 26, with a net offense level of 25, which when combined with\r\nthe defendant's Criminal History of II, would have provided for a\r\nrange of 63-78 months.  In order  to lower the base offense level\r\nto 26,  the weight of the  separated cocaine base,  when added to\r\nthe 7.43 grams  of crack cocaine in the  separate container would\r\nhave to have  been less  than 12.57  grams of cocaine  base as   \r\n2D1.1(c)(7) provides  for a  base offense level  of 26  where the\r\ncrack  cocaine is not more than  20 grams.  It  is not clear from\r\nthe record as  to why counsel  for the defendant  is of the  view\r\nthat the \"separated\" crack cocaine  in the three containers would\r\nhave weighed less than 12.57 grams.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nfound  that the  offense level was  31 with a  Guideline Range of\r\n\n121-151  months by assessing a two  level increase for possession\r\n\nof  a  firearm and  a  three  level  decrease for  acceptance  of\r\n\nresponsibility.  \r\n\n          The  government moved for a downward departure based on\r\n\nsubstantial  assistance (   5K1.1)  and  the  Court  reduced  the\r\n\nsentence below the mandatory  minimum to a term of 60 months from\r\n\nwhich the defendant now appeals.4  \r\n\n          The  emerging issues in  determining the weight  of the\r\n\noffending  controlled substances5  was partially  responsible for\r\n\nthe subsequent amendment 484 to the Sentencing Guidelines  and in\r\n\nwhich the  defendant takes comfort  in this case.   Amendment 484\r\n\nwhich  became  effective   November  1,  1993  and   amended  the\r\n\ncommentary to   2D1.1 by deleting \"21 U.S.C.   841\" and inserting\r\n\nin lieu thereof:\r\n\n          \"21  U.S.C.      841,  except   as  expressly\r\n          provided.    Mixture  or  substance does  not\r\n          include materials that must be separated from\r\n          the   controlled    substance   before    the\r\n          controlled substance can  be used.   Examples\r\n          of such materials include the fiberglass in a\r\n          cocaine/fiberglass  bonded suitcase,  beeswax\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4  The  defendant's sentencing range, prior to  departure was 121\r\nto 151 months.   The prosecution advocated a  seven year sentence\r\nand  the defendant  a three  year sentence.   The  district court\r\nindicated  it would,  in effect,  cut  the sentence  in half  and\r\nsentence  the defendant  to the  sixty-month  term.   Defendant's\r\ncounsel reasons that had the cocaine powder and cocaine base been\r\nseparated for sentencing purposes with a resulting range of 63 to\r\n78 months, cutting the sentence in  half would have resulted in a\r\n32 month sentence.  Hence, the appeal.  \r\n\n5   See United States  v.
