Sprague, with whom A. James Johnston, Sidney R.\r\nSteinberg, and Post &amp; Schell, P.C. were on brief, for appellant.\r\nPeter B. Bickerman, with whom Sumner H. Lipman, Ronald E.\r\nColby, III, and Lipman &amp; Katz, P.A. were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\nAugust 18, 1998\r\n\n                                COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge. Michael D. Carey brought this\r\nsuit against Mt. Desert Island Hospital (\"MDI\") for gender\r\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\r\n1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2000e-17, and the Maine Human Rights Act,\r\n5 M.R.S.A.  4551-4632.  He alleged that he was discharged from\r\nhis position as Vice-President of Finance because he was male.  \r\nAfter a seven day trial, a jury returned a verdict in Carey's\r\nfavor, awarding compensatory and punitive damages of $210,000 and\r\n$400,000, respectively.  The district court reduced the $610,000 \r\ntotal to $200,000 to conform with the statutory cap for awards of\r\ncompensatory and punitive damages under Title VII.  See 42 U.S.C.\r\n1981a(b)(3)(C).  The court declined to award front pay, reasoning\r\nthat it was included under the statutory cap, and was inappropriate\r\nunder the circumstances of the case.  The court awarded back pay in\r\nthe amount of $110,070, making the total amount of recovery\r\n$310,070.\r\nThe parties cross-appealed, MDI attacking the verdict and\r\nCarey challenging the post-verdict rulings limiting his recovery. \r\nMDI appeals on five points:  (1) sufficiency of the evidence; (2) \r\njury instructions on the role of gender discrimination in the\r\ndecision to terminate; (3) peremptory challenges to four female \r\nprospective jurors; (4) admission of certain deposition evidence;\r\nand (5) admission of a remark by an MDI employee manifesting anti-\r\nmale animus.  Carey argues that the court erred in failing to award\r\nfront pay and in limiting the back pay award. \r\nOur review of the record reveals that this was a case with\r\nmuch to say on either side, involving the always difficult question\r\nof probing the wellsprings of human motivation.  Moreover, it was\r\nin our minds an exceptionally hard fought trial.  While the verdict\r\ncould have gone either way, our review persuades us that no error\r\nwas committed below such as to justify reversal.  We therefore\r\naffirm the judgments.\r\n             I. Sufficiency of the evidence\r\nTitle VII makes it unlawful, inter alia, to discharge any\r\nindividual because of his sex.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(a)(1). \r\nWhere the plaintiff must prove his case by circumstantial evidence\r\nin the absence of direct evidence, as here, \"the plaintiff must\r\nmake out a prima facie case of discrimination, the employer must\r\nthen come forward with some non-discriminatory justification, and\r\nthe plaintiff finally is given the opportunity to convince the\r\ntrier of fact that the justification was pretextual and that the\r\nreal reason was discriminatory.\"  Molloy v. Blanchard, 115 F.3d 86,\r\n91 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting Cuello-Suarez v. Puerto Rico Elec.\r\nPower Auth., 988 F.2d 275, 278 (1st Cir. 1993)); see also McDonnell\r\nDouglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973) (setting forth\r\nthe burden shifting framework); St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, 509\r\nU.S. 502, 511 (1993).  At all times, the plaintiff retains the\r\nburden of persuasion.  \r\nThere is no real dispute that Carey has established a prima\r\nfacie case, as he has shown that he had a satisfactory job\r\nperformance record but was terminated and replaced by a woman.  SeeByrd v. Ronayne, 61 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir. 1995) (listing\r\nrequirements for the prima facie case) (citation omitted).  And MDI\r\nhas presented a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for\r\ntermination, namely, Carey's continued mismanagement of his\r\nfinancial responsibilities.  \r\nOur focus in determining whether or not there was sufficient\r\nevidence to justify the verdict therefore rests on the third stage\r\nof the Title VII analysis -- whether Carey introduced sufficient\r\nevidence to show that MDI's justification was false and that the\r\nreal reason for his discharge was gender.  Carey may rely on the\r\nsame evidence to prove pretext and discrimination.  See Udo v.\r\nTomes, 54 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1995).  In considering a claim of\r\ninsufficient evidence, we take the record in the light most\r\nfavorable to the verdict.  See Troy v. Bay State Computer Group,\r\nInc., 141 F.3d 378, 382 (1st Cir. 1998).  \r\nA. Events leading to termination.  \r\nMDI is a thirty-nine bed community hospital in Bar Harbor,\r\nMaine, with approximately 200 employees.  In 1983, James Mroch, the\r\nHospital's CEO, hired Carey as Comptroller.  In 1991, Carey was\r\npromoted to Vice President of Finance.  His responsibilities\r\nincluded preparation of budgets and financial reports, working with\r\noutside auditors, service on various committees, including the\r\nManagement Committee, and supervision of the Hospital's accounting\r\nand business offices.\r\nThe critical period in this case begins in January 1993 and\r\nextends to June 1994.  In January 1993, MDI's Board of Trustees\r\ndischarged Mroch, and Dan Hobbs carried out the duties of CEO until\r\nSeptember of that year.  In the meantime, Lynda Tyson, who had\r\nbecome a Board member in 1989 and chairperson in 1993, engaged a\r\nprofessional recruiter, Anna Phillips, to find a permanent\r\nreplacement for Mroch.  Carey applied for the position but in June\r\nwas told he would not be considered further.  In July 1993, after\r\nits first choice, David Pagniucci, declined the offer, the Board\r\noffered the job to Leslie Hawkins. She accepted and commenced\r\nemployment in mid-September 1993.\r\nIn the interim, on April 30, 1993, MDI's new outside auditors,\r\nBerry, Dunn, McNeil &amp; Parker (\"Berry, Dunn\") prepared a \"1993\r\nManagement Letter\" reporting conditions observed during its end of\r\nthe fiscal year audit of MDI.  The letter contained, without\r\nspecific identification, both \"reportable conditions\" and \"other\r\nobservations.\"  \"Reportable conditions were defined as \"matters .\r\n. . relating to significant deficiencies in the design or operation\r\nof the internal control structure that, in our judgment, could\r\nadversely affect the Organization's ability to record, process,\r\nsummarize, and report financial data consistent with the assertions\r\nof management in the consolidated statements.\"\r\nShortly after Hawkins commenced her duties, in September 1993,\r\nTyson arranged a meeting with Hawkins, the Board, and the Berry,\r\nDunn auditors to discuss the Management Letter.  Carey was not\r\ninvited.  The auditors said that while the items in the letter were\r\nserious and needed to be addressed, the finance department, with\r\nsome assistance, should be able to rectify them before the next\r\naudit.\r\nIn April 1994, Hawkins asked Carey to present a proposed\r\nfiscal 1995 budget to the Board before April 30.  Realizing one\r\nweek before the deadline that he could not complete the assignment\r\nin time, Carey asked for and was granted a one month extension.  In\r\nMay, he submitted a budget, which projected large deficits and some\r\nhigh expenses.  Hawkins and MDI's finance committee found the\r\nproposal unacceptable and sent the budget back for reworking.\r\nIn June, Hawkins met with the Berry, Dunn auditors, who told\r\nher that the bulk of the deficiencies noted in the 1993 Management\r\nLetter were still present.  On June 23, Hawkins terminated Carey,\r\nfollowed soon by his female assistant, Robinson.  She gave as\r\nreasons the uncorrected problems noted in the 1993 Management\r\nLetter, lack of a budget, and lack of confidence in Carey and\r\nRobinson.  Hawkins advised Lynda Tyson, the Executive Committee,\r\nand the full Board; all supported her action.  \r\nB. Pretext. \r\nThe series of events and concerns described above indicates a\r\nvery legitimate, non-discriminatory justification for discharging\r\nCarey.  More than speculation or random evidence of satisfactory\r\nperformance is required to constitute a sufficient basis for a jury\r\nfinding that incompetency and mismanagement were not the real\r\nreason for the discharge.  Cf. Byrd, 61 F.3d at 1030 (addressing\r\nthe summary judgment context).  We therefore distill all the\r\nevidence that points to pretext.\r\nWe begin by examining Carey's work record.  In evaluating\r\nCarey in 1992, Mroch said:\r\nMike works very hard, adapts quickly to change, and keeps\r\ngoing even when doing so is difficult.  Mike has\r\nresponded very well to difficult situations brought about\r\nby various board members.  Mike's fiscal abilities are\r\nexcellent.\r\nMore recent and therefore more germane is Hobbs' recommendation to\r\nthe CEO Search Committee in June 1993 that Carey be considered for\r\nthe position of CEO:\r\nI have worked closely with Mike since early February\r\nduring this difficult budgeting process and Mike has\r\nshown great tact and diplomacy in negotiating with\r\ndepartment heads in an attempt to reduce the budget\r\nexpenses, particularly in payroll.  I have been very\r\nimpressed with the manner in which it was done and which\r\nmade the decision more acceptable by those directly\r\ninvolved.\r\nThen there is the key 1993 Management Letter itself.  What\r\nsounds like a massive indictment could have been read by a\r\nskeptical jury as a list of technical accounting recommendations to\r\nbe expected from a firm making its first impression on a client. \r\nCertainly, it appears difficult for a reader to distinguish what\r\nthe accountants deemed a fairly serious \"reportable condition\" from\r\none of the \"other observations.\"  The suggestions included\r\nrecording cash on hand to the general ledger, locking up the blank\r\nchecks, avoiding imposing too many payroll functions on a single\r\nindividual (i.e., using more personnel), retaining outpatient\r\nrecords, insuring loss of records, and use of disaggregated balance\r\nsheets to show that individual restricted funds are in monthly\r\nbalance.  \r\nA jury could reasonably conclude that nothing in this\r\nsuggested an alarming hazard or a smoking gun, such as that\r\nportrayed by Hawkins.  Indeed, at least five of the recommendations\r\nended with the observation that the finance staff was already\r\nattacking the problem.  Berry, Dunn highlighted that many balance\r\nsheet accounts were not regularly reconciled or analyzed, requiring\r\nthat numerous audit adjustments be made.  They also explained in\r\nconclusion:  \"This letter appears critical by its nature because it\r\nis intended to present suggestions for management's consideration. \r\nIt does not comment on the positive aspects we noted in the\r\nHospital's system of internal accounting control and procedures\r\nduring our engagement.\"\r\nEven more revealing may have been the auditors' June 21, 1994\r\nstatus letter prepared at Hawkins' request two days before Carey's\r\ndischarge.  This letter identified the areas listed in the 1993\r\nletter that remained problematic.  In contrast to normal practice,\r\nit was developed without input from Carey and his staff.  Berry,\r\nDunn auditors concluded that the bulk of deficiencies were still\r\npresent in 1994.  But upon a close reading of the 1993 and 1994\r\nletters the jury might have understood the letters quite\r\ndifferently.  \r\nThe 1993 letter occupied six pages and contained thirteen\r\nareas of criticism, whereas the 1994 letter had three pages, with\r\nfive surviving areas of criticism.  The remaining eight areas of\r\nreported deficiencies had been resolved, substantially improved,\r\nor, in one area, could not be addressed due to equipment\r\nmalfunction.  The principal remaining problem was inability to\r\nreconcile balance sheet accounts to supporting documentation. \r\nThis, of course, might have been a critical shortcoming, but the\r\njury need not have so concluded.  Such a status letter, even in the\r\nabsence of staff opportunity to defend and explain, might well have\r\nappeared to the jury as less than a clarion call for termination.\r\nThe jury also heard the testimony of Carey's expert witness,\r\nIsrael Laeger, senior member of a Bangor, Maine, accounting firm.\r\nLaeger had reviewed all CPA audits and management letters from 1990\r\nto 1995.  He pointed out that (1) a new accounting firm may seek to\r\nimpress a client with a sizeable list of criticisms; (2) \r\n\"reportable conditions\" are basically judgment calls that are the\r\nproduct of the accountant's subjective view of seriousness; (3) an\r\n\"opinion audit\" is one where the auditor can vouch for the accuracy\r\nof a financial statement; (4) a \"qualified opinion\" means that\r\nthere are some \"things not up to snuff\" preventing an unqualified\r\nopinion; (5) all the audit opinions of MDI were unqualified,\r\nmeaning that \"they were given a clean bill of health\"; and (6) the\r\nnumber of deficiencies identified in audit reports had steadily\r\ndecreased from 1992 to 1994.  Laeger concluded that nothing in the\r\naudit reports and letters indicated that Carey was not living up to\r\nhis responsibilities as Chief Financial Officer.\r\nFinally, the jury might have doubted the facial justifications\r\nadvanced by Hawkins concerning the relative infrequency of meetings\r\nbetween Hawkins and Carey, whose offices were in close proximity. \r\nAnd they may have suspected that she thwarted his ability to\r\nsucceed based on evidence that she refused to allow Carey to fill\r\nall the budgeted positions allotted him, did not give him any\r\nadvance warnings of serious trouble despite earlier assurance that\r\nshe would inform him if she had problems with his job performance,\r\nand the absense of any effort to institute \"progressive discipline\"\r\nor corrective action, as was general practice, before dismissal.\r\nWe therefore cannot say that disbelief of the reasons\r\nproffered by MDI would be unsupported or unfounded.\r\nC. Evidence of gender discrimination.  \r\nThis conclusion, however, would not be enough to support the\r\nverdict.  It may very well be that Hawkins, Tyson, and the entire\r\nBoard had come to the point where they did not like Carey's style,\r\nfinding him too openly critical of others and insensitive in his\r\npublic utterances.  If such were the real motivation for his\r\ndischarge, it might or might not be fair but certainly would not be\r\ndiscrimination prohibited by law.  It therefore was incumbent on\r\nCarey to introduce sufficient evidence to enable a reasonable jury\r\nto find that the justifications advanced by MDI for his discharge\r\nwere a cover for an underlying anti-male animus.\r\nIn a case such as this, where a plaintiff must rely on\r\ncircumstantial as opposed to direct evidence of gender\r\ndiscrimination, the evidence will necessarily be composed of bits\r\nand pieces, which may or may not point to an atmosphere of gender\r\ndiscrimination.  While an employer should not find itself in\r\njeopardy by reason of occasional stray remarks by ordinary\r\nemployees, \r\ncircumstantial evidence of a discriminatory atmosphere at\r\na plaintiff's place of employment is relevant to the\r\nquestion of motive in considering a discrimination claim.\r\n. . . [E]vidence of a corporate state-of-mind or a\r\ndiscriminatory atmosphere is not rendered irrelevant by\r\nits failure to coincide precisely with the particular\r\nactors or timeframe involved in the specific events that\r\ngenerated a claim of discriminatory treatment.\r\nConway v. Electro Switch Corp., 825 F.2d 593, 597-98 (1st Cir.\r\n1987)(citations omitted).\r\nThe record reveals the following evidence in support of \r\nBrennan's claim of sex based discriminatory animus:\r\n-- In August 1992, Fundraising and Public Relations Director\r\n(and member of the Management Committee) Carol Gordon had a\r\ndiscussion with Carey and another employee about a television\r\nprogram on child abuse at day care centers.  She concluded the\r\ndiscussion with, \"we live in a patriarchal society, and men shirk\r\ntheir duties toward child raising.  And because men have money,\r\npower and position, because they have penises, then this is the\r\ntype of thing that happens as a result.\"  Carey told Evans that the\r\nremarks were inappropriate and filed a sexual harassment complaint\r\nwith the Personnel Director, Penny Evans.  Shortly thereafter,\r\nEvans expressed regret to Carey that he had taken her remark the\r\nwrong way and that he had filed a complaint.\r\n-- In late 1992, the steering committee for MDI's new Women's\r\nHealth Center, whose members included Jeanne DuLong, Director of\r\nNursing, Evans, Gordon, and Carey (the only male), prepared a\r\nmission statement for the Center.  As first drafted, the statement\r\nbarred the employment of men, including male physicians.  Carey\r\nobjected to the draft, indicated it could be illegal and sought a\r\nlegal opinion.  After obtaining the opinion, the mission statement\r\nwas changed so as not to exclude men.\r\n-- In the spring of 1993, a management committee member, Brian\r\nMcCarthy, complained to Evans about another employee's having\r\nthrown water in his face.  He testified that Evans was not\r\nreceptive to his complaint, telling him not to worry about it. \r\nWhen he asked what she would do in the event water was thrown at a\r\nfemale employee, Evans said the person would probably be fired. \r\nShe explained, \"we have different standards for men and women.\"\r\n-- Tyson, then Vice-Chair of the Board, helped secure the\r\ndischarge of Mroch as President and CEO.  Upon his termination in\r\nearly 1993, she hired an executive search firm, placing Anna\r\nPhillips in charge of identifying a prospective CEO for MDI.  In\r\nthe summer of 1993, Gordon, Brian McCarthy, David Frongillo,\r\nDirector of the MDI Pharmacy, and Hawkins, who was then a\r\ncandidate, met with Phillips.  Frongillo asked if there was a\r\nselection criterion involving gender, to which Gordon responded,\r\n\"it's about time that we get a woman for this position,\" and\r\nPhillips said that \"they would very much like to put a woman in\r\nthat position.\"  Meanwhile, Carey's own application received short\r\nshrift.  He testified that Phillips interviewed him for only about\r\nthirty minutes, never asked about his qualifications, and appeared\r\nnot to have read his resume.  Tyson testified that Evans, DuLong,\r\nand Gordon had all told her that they would not be \"comfortable\r\nwith Mr. Carey as CEO.\" \r\n-- By the time Hawkins was hired, Tyson and Gordon were close\r\nfriends, as were Evans and Gordon, and all were uncomfortable with\r\nCarey.  When Hawkins was hired, Tyson told her that she faced\r\nseveral challenges, \"one of which was the financial stability and\r\n. . . that she might have some problems in the finance department.\" \r\n-- In late 1993, MDI conducted an employee opinion survey, a\r\nsummary of which was placed in an administrative mailbox used by\r\nboth Carey and Hawkins.  Although obviously intended for Hawkins,\r\nCarey saw the responses and noted on the summary page a statement\r\nfrom an unnamed employee that Hawkins needed to take action against\r\n\"the power-hungry men in administration.\"  Although the comment\r\nitself is entitled to little weight, that this message was intended\r\nfor administration eyes and that the compiler of the survey results\r\nsaw fit to place the comment on the summary page for Hawkins are\r\nmore significant.\r\n-- Finally, Carey, when facing performance problems, appears\r\nto have been treated differently by Hawkins than were Evans,\r\nGordon, and DuLong.  Although only Carey and DuLong were Vice-\r\nPresidents, the other two were senior managers and all served on\r\nthe Management Committee.  \"The test is whether a prudent person,\r\nlooking objectively at the incidents, would think them roughly\r\nequivalent and the protagonists similarly situated. . . . Exact\r\ncorrelation is neither likely nor necessary, but the cases must be\r\nfair congeners.\"  Molloy, 115 F.3d at 91 (quoting Dartmouth Review\r\nv. Dartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1989)).  All three\r\nwomen had encountered problems in their jobs and were given\r\n\"progressive discipline,\" i.e., assistance and time to take\r\ncorrective action, rather than prompt termination.\r\nMDI in its briefs and argument compartmentalizes the above\r\nevidence, isolating each incident, relationship, or statement,\r\narguing that each has no bearing on any animus that could have\r\ninfluenced Hawkins.  But all of the evidence was presented to the\r\njury and we would find it very difficult indeed to say that the\r\ntotality fell below a triable threshold.  The statements and\r\nincidents did not relate to miscellaneous low level employees but\r\nto a fairly tight group of top officials.  We therefore hold that\r\nthere was sufficient evidence to support a finding that\r\ndeficiencies in Carey's handling of financial controls were not the\r\nreal reason for his discharge but instead covered an action\r\nstemming from gender discrimination.    \r\nWe see no point in separately analyzing the court's refusal to\r\norder a new trial.  As is evident from our discussion on the \r\nsufficiency of the evidence, we do not consider the court's action\r\nto be an abuse of discretion.  See Simon v. Navon, 71 F.3d 9, 13\r\n(1st Cir. 1995).\r\n                 II. Jury Instructions\r\nMDI argues that the court in its original jury instructions\r\ncommitted error by charging that the plaintiff had the burden of\r\nshowing by a preponderance of the evidence that \"gender was a\r\nmotivating factor\" in MDI's decision to fire him.  It had urged the\r\ncourt to use the words \"a determining factor\" or \"the motivating\r\nfactor,\" reasoning that, in cases resting on circumstantial rather\r\nthan direct evidence, such language should be used to accord with\r\nour opinions in LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836,\r\n842, 846 (1st Cir. 1993), and Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950\r\nF.2d 816, 828 (1st Cir. 1991). \r\nThe court resisted, observing that in LeBlanc and other First\r\nCircuit cases we have used both \"motivating\" and \"determining\"\r\nwithout any clear indication that one was preferable.  The court\r\nwas persuaded that \"a motivating factor\" was the correct\r\ninstruction by the wording chosen by Congress in Section 107(a) of\r\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991, an amendment to the Civil Rights Act\r\nof 1964.  Section 107(a), codified as 42  2000e-2(m), states, \"an\r\nunlawful employment practice is established when the complaining\r\nparty demonstrates that . . . sex . . . was a motivating factor for\r\nany employment practice, even though other factors also motivated\r\nthe practice.\"\r\nMDI argues that the court misapplied 42  2000e-2(m), which it\r\nmaintains covers direct but not circumstantial evidence cases,  and\r\ntherefore committed reversible error.  What MDI has not adverted to\r\nin its brief was that after the jury had been out for about ninety\r\nminutes, the jury sent the court a note asking for a legal\r\ndefinition of \"motivating factor\" with specific reference to \"how\r\nmuch weight is to be rendered to make decision.\"  What followed\r\nwas, in our opinion, of crucial importance insofar as decision in\r\nthis case is concerned.\r\nCourt and counsel proceeded to engage in a substantial\r\ncolloquy, spanning eighteen pages of transcript.  After hearing\r\nargument from counsel, the court dictated a draft supplemental\r\ninstruction, which read in relevant part:\r\nThe plaintiff therefore has the burden of establishing\r\nthat it is more likely than not that gender was a\r\nmotivating or determining factor in the firing of the\r\nplaintiff by the defendant.  In other words, it is for\r\nthe jury to determine, based on all the evidence, that it\r\nis more likely than not that the defendant's decision to\r\nterminate the plaintiff was motivated by gender\r\ndiscrimination.  If you find that the plaintiff was\r\ndischarged for reasons other than his gender you must\r\nfind for the defendant.\r\nAt this juncture, Carey's counsel proposed adding, at the end\r\nof the first sentence, \"even though other factors also motivated\r\nthe practice.\"  The court expressed concern that the proposed\r\naddition \"conveys an impression that they need not concern\r\nthemselves with what really caused the termination.  As long as\r\nthere's a drop of causal effect by any of these factors in the mix,\r\nthey can find for the plaintiff.\" \r\nCarey's counsel then tried to persuade the judge to drop the\r\nlast sentence.  Before doing so, the court called upon MDI's\r\ncounsel to weigh in on the proposed language.  MDI's counsel \r\nresponded as follows:\r\nMR.. JOHNSTON:  Well, I think that last sentence is a\r\nperfectly accurate statement of the law, and I don't\r\nthink it's misleading at all.\r\n\nMS. FARRELL (co-counsel): It does balance out the rest of\r\nit.\r\nAfter the court refused a request by Carey's counsel to add that\r\ngender discrimination need not be the sole motivating factor, the\r\ncourt accepted the draft supplemental instruction, unchanged. \r\nWe are aware of the controversy that exists over whether the\r\n\"a motivating factor\" language in 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m) applies to\r\nall discrimination cases, as the language indicates, or was\r\nintended only to overrule in part the standard set forth in Price\r\nWaterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989).  If the latter is true,\r\nas MDI maintains, then the amendment is limited to \"direct\r\nevidence/mixed motive\" cases and leaves unscathed the McDonnell\r\nDouglas approach to \"circumstantial evidence/pretext\" cases.  We\r\nsee no need to enter this thicket at the moment.  For the purposes\r\nof this case we assume that the court's original instruction was in\r\nerror.\r\nBut we look upon the court's colloquy with counsel, the\r\nsupplemental instruction, and the input from counsel as a thorough\r\nand effective effort to clarify an earlier misunderstanding.  The\r\nfirst sentence of the supplemental instruction, it is true, does\r\nnot specify what factor is determinative.  But the second sentence,\r\nbeginning with \"in other words,\" narrows the meaning, clarifying\r\nthat the decision must have been motivated by gender.  If any doubt\r\nwere to remain, the last sentence clearly conveys the thought that\r\nthe defendant escapes liability unless the plaintiff establishes\r\nthat the sole motivation was gender.  Indeed, if anything, this\r\nwording favors defendant more than it should, for it goes beyond\r\nthe concept of \"determining,\" requiring that if any reason other\r\nthan gender played, however minimal, a part in the discharge, Carey\r\nmay not recover.\r\nTo cap all this, both counsel for MDI affirmatively indicated\r\ntheir approval of the supplemental instruction to the court.  In\r\nour opinion, to hold under these circumstances that the trial court\r\ncommitted reversible error would impose an unrealistic burden of\r\nperfection on a court facing the constant pressures of trial.\r\n               III.  Miscellaneous Issues\r\nAs a very small tail on a very long dog, several other issues\r\nraised by MDI may be touched upon briefly.  The first is that\r\nCarey's counsel, by peremptorily challenging four female potential\r\njurors, and indicating that he was, in so doing, relying on a juror\r\nrating system which consisted of such factors as occupation,\r\neducation, and familiarity with the local region, violated the\r\nteaching of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).  Inasmuch as\r\nMDI challenged three males and one female, the jury as drawn\r\ncontained five men and five women, and, after Carey offered his\r\nrating system explanation, MDI indicated to the court that it had\r\nno more questions on the Batson issue, we find it difficult to find\r\nthat the court abused its discretion in not pursuing explanations\r\nany further.\r\nMDI also claims error in the admission into evidence of\r\ndeposition testimony of Anna Phillips, which allegedly included \r\nhearsay and irrelevant material.  MDI makes cursory reference in\r\nits brief to \"feminist\" beliefs of members of the search committee,\r\narguing that these were not relevant to the present case.  We\r\nconfess ourselves unable, upon a thorough search of the record, to\r\nidentify such material in Phillips' testimony.  In any event, we \r\ncannot believe that in this lengthy trial discussion by Phillips of\r\n\"feminist\" beliefs held by persons at MDI could have made any\r\nimpact.  No case of reversible error has been made to us.  \r\nWe find the same as to certain notes of Phillips that were not\r\nadmitted into evidence but allowed to be shown in an overhead\r\nprojector.  MDI tells us they were \"inherently unreliable,\r\nprejudicial and irrelevant.\"  But we are not told just what they\r\nwere and how they would have adversely impacted MDI.  We expect\r\nmore from counsel serious about asserting reversible error.\r\nFinally, MDI claims error in admitting over objection Gordon's\r\n\"penis and power\" comment, with which we commenced our search for\r\ngender discriminatory indicia.  The specific claim is that the\r\nprejudicial effect of the comment greatly outweighed its probative\r\nvalue.  Were this an isolated remark or incident, this would be a\r\nmore viable argument.  But in context, particularly in light of the\r\nevidence of Gordon's close friendship with Tyson and her senior\r\nposition in management, we simply cannot say that the court abused\r\nits discretion in admitting the evidence.  To ask for a new trial\r\non the basis of this ruling strains our credulity.\r\n               IV.  Front and Back Pay\r\nCarey appeals the denial of front pay and the partial\r\nreduction of his back pay award for failure to mitigate damages. \r\nWe review the district court's decision to deny these awards for an\r\nabuse of discretion.  See Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., 104\r\nF.3d 9, 12-13 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[t]rial courts have discretion to\r\nfashion awards in Title VII cases so as to fully compensate a\r\nplaintiff in a manner that suits the specific facts of the case\"). \r\nCarey alleges error in the court's conclusion that front pay\r\nwas included under the statutory cap, see 42 U.S.C. \r\n1981a(b)(3)(C), and that such an award was unnecessary given other\r\nrelief granted Carey.  We elect not to address the statutory cap\r\nissue as we find the district court's determination that Carey\r\nreceived sufficient compensation without front pay to be entirely\r\nwithin the court's discretion.     \r\nThe court addressed the merits of Carey's front pay request on\r\ntwo occasions.  On November 20, 1996, after receiving briefing from\r\nboth parties on the front pay issue, the court ruled that front pay\r\nis included under the statutory cap and \r\nin any event, the Court would be reluctant to award\r\nadditional front pay in this case because of the\r\nsubstantial liquidated damages awarded by the jury . . .\r\n[A]ny additional award of front pay would be\r\ninappropriate under the circumstances of this case. \r\nWildman v. Lerner Stores Corp., 771 F.2d 605, 616 (1stCir. 1985) [finding that future damages were unnecessary,\r\ngiven that the plaintiff had been awarded compensatory\r\ndamages, liquidated damages, and double and additional\r\ndamages under state law].\r\n\nAnd on February 20, 1997, the court denied Carey's motion to\r\nreconsider, stating, \r\n[w]hether front pay is included under the statutory cap\r\nor not, the Court indicated that it would not award\r\nPlaintiff front pay in this case.  The $200,000 in\r\ndamages Plaintiff will recover after the jury's award of\r\n$610,000 is capped, plus the back pay the Court will\r\naward Plaintiff, the exact amount of which is still\r\nuncertain, will more than adequately compensate\r\nplaintiff.\r\n\nWe discern from these statements that the court appears to\r\nhave looked to the jury's award of punitive damages rather than to\r\nthe statutorily capped damage award in denying front pay on\r\nNovember 20, 1996.  While this was inappropriate as the liquidated\r\ndamages award was not an accurate measure of the award Carey would\r\nactually receive, it is clear that on February 20, 1997, the court\r\nfound the $200,000 cap and back pay award fully sufficient to\r\ncompensate Carey.  This determination, standing alone, is entirely\r\nsupportable, and we can see no basis to conclude, as Carey would\r\nhave us do, that it was \"tainted\" by the November 20, 1996 ruling. \r\nWe can find no \"strong evidence of a lapse in judgment,\"  Selgas,\r\n104 F.3d at 12, as required for a finding of an abuse of\r\ndiscretion. \r\nNeither can we discern an abuse of discretion as to the back\r\npay award.  Carey was entitled to recover for what he would have\r\nearned absent the discharge, reduced by any compensation that he\r\nactually received and any additional amount that he would have\r\nreceived through reasonable efforts to mitigate the damages, with\r\nthe employer bearing the burden of proof on the issue of\r\nmitigation.  See Troy, 141 F.3d at 382; Wilcox v. Stratton Lumber,\r\nInc., 921 F. Supp. 837, 842 (D. Me. 1996); 42 U.S.C.  2000e-\r\n5(g)(1).  \r\nCorrectly applying this standard, the court concluded that MDI\r\nhad successfully shown through expert testimony and evidence\r\nconcerning the actual number of applications made relative to the\r\nnumber of positions available that Carey did not exercise\r\nreasonable diligence in seeking comparable employment.  The result\r\nwas an award to Carey of $110,070 in back pay, which represented a\r\nreduction by $100,000 for failure to fully mitigate damages and a\r\nreduction by the amount of money Carey earned or received in\r\nunemployment during the relevant period.  \r\nIn support of his abuse of discretion argument, Carey\r\nessentially repeats the evidence he presented below, relying\r\nparticularly on testimony from his expert to rebut evidence by\r\nMDI's expert.  We see no need to pursue this further.  The court's\r\norder demonstrates a thoughtful weighing of the credibility of the\r\nwitnesses and the various evidence presented by each party,\r\nresulting in an award that was somewhere in between that desired by\r\neach party.  Such weighing was fully within the court's discretion\r\nand is supported by the evidence.  V.  Conclusion\r\n We therefore affirm the district court on all issues raised\r\nby both parties on appeal.  Each party shall pay its own costs.\r\n                         Concurrence and dissent follow.     ALDRICH, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.  The difficulty of\r\nthe issue that principally divides the court is indicated by the\r\nfact that discussion of the jury's question that led to a three\r\nsentence supplemental instruction, occupies 18 pages of transcript. \r\nMy disagreement with our dissenting brother is based on my\r\nassessment of the jury's thinking as  shown by its question, and my\r\nbelief that if a jury hears twice from the same source it is likely\r\nto emphasize, if not concentrate on, what it has last heard.\r\nThe jury's question is interesting.  We do not have the exact\r\nlanguage, but it appears to have requested a legal definition of\r\n\"motivating factor,\" and \"how much weight is to be rendered to make\r\na decision?\"  Since it had been instructed as to what is generally\r\nneeded to meet the burden of proof I assume great thought went into\r\nthis question: Is it enough for gender to be a concurrent factor,\r\nor does motivating require sufficient weight to itself effect the\r\ndecision?  This last is what it was told.  What the dissent labels\r\nas part (b) of the court's response to the question, \"not\r\nnecessarily inconsistent with the established standards governing\r\npretext cases,\" (a bit overgrudging, I prefer \"consistent\" to not\r\n\"necessarily inconsistent\") the dissent would diminish because\r\npresumably \"colored by the original 'a motivating factor'\r\ninstruction.\"  But was it not just because the jury was not\r\nsatisfied by the original instruction that it asked for\r\nillumination?  With great respect, is it not unfair to say that the\r\nquestioned shadow persisted?  I say particularly unfair when\r\ndefendant's last remark was an assent.  The jury had received an\r\napparently full answer to its question, and I do not believe it is\r\nto be thought to have reached back and modified it by what had\r\nbothered it before.  I read (b) and (c) together as understood to\r\nmean that plaintiff must show that discrimination was of sufficient\r\nweight to itself warrant the discharge, and it was in fact the\r\nactivating cause.  To this defendant can have no complaint.     STAHL, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  The majority \"assume[s],\"\r\nfor purposes of analysis, that the district court's original charge\r\nwas in error, but concludes that its response to the jury's\r\nquestion about the meaning of the erroneous \"motivating factor\"\r\ninstruction was fully curative, and/or that MDI's counsel waived\r\nits objection by acceding to a portion of the court's supplemental\r\ninstruction.  Because I cannot agree that the defendant hospital\r\neither waived its objection to or was not prejudiced by the\r\nerroneous instruction, and because I believe it important to\r\nexplain why the original instruction was erroneous, I respectfully\r\ndissent.\r\n                           I.\r\nEmployment discrimination cases involving claims of disparate\r\ntreatment can be divided into two broad categories: (1) cases in\r\nwhich the plaintiff has \"direct\" evidence of discrimination, and (2)\r\ncases in which the plaintiff's evidence of discrimination is\r\n\"indirect.\"  See, e.g., Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413, 421\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  Under prevailing law, the proper\r\ncharacterization of a plaintiff's case as direct or indirect\r\nlargely determines the manner in which the plaintiff may establish\r\nthe defendant's liability.\r\nWhere the plaintiff's proof is indirect (as will typically be\r\nthe case), the plaintiff's claim normally will be adjudicated in\r\naccordance with the familiar rules laid out in the line of cases\r\nbeginning with McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792\r\n(1973), see F.W. Morse, 76 F.3d at 421, and recited in the panel\r\nmajority's opinion, see ante.  At the time of the enactment of the\r\nCivil Rights Act of 1991 (\"1991 Act\"), cases in which a plaintiff\r\nhad direct evidence of discrimination were governed not by\r\nMcDonnell Douglas, but by Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228\r\n(1989).  See, e.g., Jackson v. Havard Univ., 900 F.2d 464, 467 (1st\r\nCir. 1990).  Under the Price Waterhouse rule, if a plaintiff\r\nintroduced direct evidence of discrimination sufficient to\r\ndemonstrate (by a preponderance of the evidence) that an\r\nimpermissible consideration (race, gender, etc.) was a motivating\r\nfactor in the contested job action, the burden of proof then\r\nshifted to the defendant to prove that it would have taken the same\r\njob action against the plaintiff even absent the impermissible\r\nmotivating factor.  See Jackson, 900 F.2d at 467.  If the defendant\r\nsucceeded in so proving, it avoided liability altogether.  SeePrice Waterhouse, 490 U.S. at 244-45 (plurality opinion); id. at\r\n261-62, 271 (O'Connor, J., concurring).\r\nAgainst the backdrop of McDonnell Douglas and Price\r\nWaterhouse, Congress in 1991 amended Title VII of the Civil Rights\r\nAct of 1964 by adding two new subsections.  Section 107(a) of the\r\n1991 Act provided the following:\r\nExcept as otherwise provided in this title, an unlawful\r\nemployment practice is established when the complaining\r\nparty demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or\r\nnational origin was a motivating factor for any\r\nemployment practice, even though other factors also\r\nmotivated the practice.\r\n\n1991 Act, Pub. L. No. 102-166,  107(a), 105 Stat. 1071, 1075\r\n(1991) (emphasis added) (codified at 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(m)). \r\nSection 107(b) further added:\r\nOn a claim in which an individual proves a violation\r\nunder [ 107(a)] and a respondent demonstrates that the\r\nrespondent would have taken the same action in the\r\nabsence of the impermissible motivating factor, the\r\ncourt--\r\n\n(i) may grant declaratory relief (except as provided in\r\nclause (ii)), and attorney's fees and costs demonstrated\r\nto be directly attributable only to the pursuit of a\r\nclaim under [ 107(a)]; and\r\n\n(ii) shall not award damages or issue an order requiring\r\nadmission, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment,\r\ndescribed in subparagraph [42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(2)(A)].\r\n\nId.,  107(b), 105 Stat. at 1077 (codified at 42 U.S.C.  2000e-\r\n5(g)(2)(B)(i)-(ii)).\r\nThe 1991 Act was, in large part, Congress's response to a\r\nseries of Supreme Court decisions interpreting various provisions\r\nof the federal civil rights laws.  See Landgraf v. USI Film\r\nProducts, 511 U.S. 244, 250 (1994).  Section 107 was specifically\r\nintended to address   and overturn, in part   the holding of Price\r\nWaterhouse.  See id.; Tanca v. Nordberg, 98 F.3d 680, 681-82 (1st\r\nCir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1253 (1997); see also H.R.\r\nRep. No. 102-40(I) (Education and Labor Committee), at 45-47\r\n(1991), reprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 549, 583-86; H.R. Rep. No.\r\n102-40(II) (Judiciary Committee), at 16-19 (1991), reprinted in1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 694, 709-12.\r\nUnder Section 107, if a plaintiff proves that at least one of\r\nthe motivating factors for the defendant's employment action was an\r\nimpermissible one   i.e., that the defendant acted, at best, with\r\n\"mixed motives\"   liability under Title VII is established.  42\r\nU.S.C.  2000e-2(m).  Section 107 thus abrogates the holding of\r\nPrice Waterhouse, insofar as that decision permitted an employer\r\nwith \"mixed motives\" to avoid liability altogether by proving that\r\nit would have taken the same job action against the plaintiff\r\nabsent any impermissible motivation.  Under Section 107, such proof\r\nby an employer does not provide a basis for avoiding liability, but\r\ndoes preclude any recovery of damages by the plaintiff and also\r\nbars certain important forms of injunctive relief, including\r\nreinstatement.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(2)(B)(ii).\r\nWhile it is clear, then, that Section 107 displaces the rule\r\nof Price Waterhouse, it is less clear whether Section 107 should\r\nhave any application in cases traditionally litigated under\r\nMcDonnell Douglas.  The conceptual problem arises from the fact\r\nthat the \"a motivating factor\" rubric of  2000e-2(m)   which was\r\nincorporated in the district court's instructions here   is\r\ndirectly at odds with the established understanding of the\r\nplaintiff's burden of proof in the McDonnell Douglas framework,\r\nparticularly as delineated in cases like St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.\r\nHicks, 509 U.S. 502, 506-07 (1993).\r\nWithin the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff bears the\r\nultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the\r\ndefendant's proffered reasons for the challenged job action are a\r\npretext for discrimination, i.e., that the \"true reason\" for the\r\ndecision was discriminatory.  See Hicks, 509 U.S. at 507-08, 515,\r\n517; Smith v. Stratus Computer, Inc., 40 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.\r\n1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1108 (1995); Woods v. Friction\r\nMaterials, Inc., 30 F.3d 255, 260 (1st Cir. 1994).  To say that a\r\nparticular motivation was the \"true reason\" for an action must mean\r\nat least that absent that motivation   that is to say, but for it\r\nthe action would not have occurred.  Bibbs v. Block, 778 F.2d\r\n1318, 1321 (8th Cir. 1985) (en banc).  Thus, satisfying McDonnell\r\nDouglas's burden of proof must entail persuading the finder of fact\r\nthat the determinative reason for the adverse job action was notthe rationale proffered by the defendant, but was, instead,\r\ndiscrimination.  See Loeb v. Textron, Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1019\r\n(1st Cir. 1979) (interpreting McDonnell Douglas to require\r\nplaintiff to prove that discriminatory motive was \"the\r\ndeterminative factor\" or \"but for\" cause of adverse job action); seealso Hartsell v. Duplex Products, Inc., 123 F.3d 766, 772 (4th Cir.\r\n1997); Simon v. City of Youngstown, 73 F.3d 68, 70 (6th Cir. 1995);\r\nWilson, 55 F.3d at 130 (quoting Miller v. Cigna Corp., 47 F.3d 586,\r\n598 (3d Cir. 1995) (en banc)); Maguire v. Marquette Univ., 814 F.2d\r\n1213, 1216 (7th Cir. 1987).  Certainly, proving that discrimination\r\nwas just one motivating factor among other, nondiscriminatory\r\nfactors   which is all that is required to prove liability under\r\n2000e-2(m)   cannot suffice to establish that the discriminatory\r\nmotive was causally determinative, and hence cannot be enough to\r\nestablish liability and a right to recovery under McDonnell\r\nDouglas.  See Goostree v. Tennessee, 796 F.2d 854, 863 (6th Cir.\r\n1986) (\"The mere showing that 'sex was a factor' rather than a 'but\r\nfor' factor is insufficient to establish liability under Title\r\nVII.\").\r\nThe incompatibility of  2000e-2(m) with McDonnell Douglas is\r\nfurther demonstrated by the close relationship between  2000e-2(m)\r\nand  2000e-5(g)(2)(B).  If  2000e-2(m) applied to every disparate\r\ntreatment case, then  2000e-5(g)(2)(B) would be triggered in every\r\nsuch case in which the plaintiff prevailed (since the prevailing\r\nplaintiff necessarily would have proved a violation under  2000e-\r\n2(m)).  As noted above,  2000e-5(g)(2)(B) permits a defendant to\r\navoid damages and certain other consequences by demonstrating that\r\nit would have \"taken the same action\" absent a discriminatory\r\nmotive.  42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(2)(B).  But in cases where a\r\nplaintiff has prevailed under McDonnell Douglas, the factfinder\r\nnecessarily will have found that discrimination was the \"true\r\nreason\" for the defendant's action.  See, e.g., Hicks, 509 U.S. at\r\n507-08.  In such cases, it would be absurd to ask the factfinder\r\nalso to determine, as  2000e-5(g)(2)(B) would require, whether the\r\ndefendant would have \"taken the same action\" absent a discriminatory\r\nmotive.\r\nThe most plausible way to resolve the apparent conflict\r\nbetween  2000e-2(m) and McDonnell Douglas is to limit the\r\napplication of  2000e-2(m) to \"mixed motive\" cases that fit the\r\nPrice Waterhouse mold (cases in which the plaintiff has \"direct\r\nevidence\" of discrimination), and hold it inapplicable in \"pretext\"\r\ncases governed by McDonnell Douglas.  This is a more sensible\r\nsolution, in any event, than drawing the conclusion that Congress,\r\nin enacting  2000e-2(m), intended effectively to abrogate the\r\ncentral tenets of the McDonnell Douglas canon.\r\nThe legislative history of the 1991 Act indicates that Section\r\n107 was specifically intended to address the Supreme Court's\r\nholding in Price Waterhouse with respect to the standards of proof\r\ngoverning liability in \"mixed motive\" cases.  See H.R. Rep. No. 102-\r\n40(I), supra, at 48, 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 586 (\"Section [107] of\r\nthe legislation . . . overrules one aspect of the Supreme Court's\r\ndecision in Price Waterhouse.\"); H.R. Rep. No. 102-40(II), supra,\r\nat 16-17, 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 709-10 (same); see also 137 Cong.\r\nRec. S15476 (Oct. 30, 1991) (interpretive mem. submitted by Sen.\r\nDole) (same); 137 Cong. Rec. H9529 (Nov. 7, 1991) (interpretive\r\nmem. submitted by Rep. Edwards) (same).  Dicta in one Supreme Court\r\ndecision and in two of our own prior decisions support this same\r\nconclusion.  See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 251 (\"[Section] 107 responds\r\nto Price Waterhouse . . . by setting forth standards applicable in\r\n'mixed motive' cases.\"); Tanca, 98 F.3d at 681-82 (\"Congress\r\npartially overruled Price Waterhouse in the 1991 Act by allowing a\r\nfinding of liability and limited relief to plaintiffs in mixed\r\nmotive cases.\"); Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d 413, 419 n.3\r\n(1st Cir. 1996) (\"[T]he Price Waterhouse framework for proof of\r\n'mixed motive' discrimination . . . is somewhat changed under the\r\n1991 Act.\").  There is absolutely no indication, on the other hand,\r\nthat Congress intended the 1991 Act to overturn or even affect any\r\naspect of McDonnell Douglas or its derivatives.\r\nIt would be implausible to assume that Congress, in enacting\r\n2000e-2(m) to address one part of the Supreme Court's decision in\r\nPrice Waterhouse, also intended, sub silentio, to eradicate the\r\nestablished legal landscape governing the litigation of disparate\r\ntreatment cases.  Cf. Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff\r\nBureau, Inc., 476 U.S. 409, 418-22 (1986) (legislation overturning\r\na recent Supreme Court decision involving one particular\r\napplication of a longstanding judicially constructed rule could not\r\nbe read as implicit rejection of the entire framework of the rule\r\napplied in the overturned decision).  A far more reasonable\r\nproposition is that 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(m) was meant to describe\r\nthe standard for establishing liability only in \"mixed motive\"\r\ncases, not in standard \"pretext\" cases governed by McDonnell\r\nDouglas.   See Fuller v. Phipps, 67 F.3d 1137, 1143-44 (4th Cir.\r\n1995) (\"Section 107 was intended to benefit plaintiffs in mixed-\r\nmotive cases; it has nothing to say about the analysis in pretext\r\ncases such as this one.\").  Under this reasoning, a district court\r\nerrs by giving a jury instruction pursuant to  2000e-2(m), unless\r\nthe court determines that the plaintiff has adduced evidence of\r\ndiscrimination sufficient to take the case outside the McDonnell\r\nDouglas paradigm, and I would so hold.\r\nHere, neither party has argued   and the district court never\r\nruled   that this case is anything but a standard \"pretext\" case\r\ngoverned by the principles of McDonnell Douglas.  Yet, the\r\ndistrict court, explicitly relying on 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(m),\r\ninstructed the jury that the plaintiff's burden was merely to prove\r\nthat his gender was \"a motivating factor\" in MDI's decision to fire\r\nhim.  I would find (as the majority \"assumes\" without deciding)\r\nthat MDI's objection to this instruction was well-founded.  By\r\ninstructing the jury that Carey was entitled to prevail upon a\r\nfinding that discrimination had been merely \"a motivating factor\"\r\nin MDI's decision to terminate him, the district court erroneously\r\nunderstated the plaintiff's burden of proof under the governing\r\nlegal framework.\r\n                          II.\r\nBut instructional error warrants reversal, of course, only if\r\nit was prejudicial.  See Federico v. Order of St. Benedict, 64 F.3d\r\n1, 3-4 (1st Cir. 1995).  The court's original \"a motivating factor\"\r\ninstruction, standing alone, unquestionably prejudiced the\r\ndefendant by materially understating the plaintiff's true burden of\r\nproof.  The majority does not dispute this fact.  The majority\r\nconcludes, however, that the district court effectively cured the\r\nerror in its original instruction with its response to the jury's\r\nquestion about the meaning of \"motivating factor.\"  I disagree.\r\nAs a preliminary matter, it is important to understand that\r\nthe court's so-called \"supplemental instruction\" was, at best, just\r\nthat   a supplement to the original instruction, given in response\r\nto a question that came from the jury after it had already retired\r\nto deliberate.  The court at no time instructed the jury that the\r\noriginal \"a motivating factor\" charge was incorrect, to be\r\ndisregarded, or in any way problematic.  Nor did the court advise\r\nthe jury that the supplemental instruction, to the extent it might\r\nhave been read as contradicting the original charge, was to be\r\ngiven precedence.  Thus, in assessing the question of prejudice, we\r\nmust ask not simply whether the supplemental instruction itself\r\nprovided an accurate statement of the law (a question I would\r\nanswer in the negative, see infra), but whether that instruction  \r\neven if it was correct   was sufficiently overriding and forceful\r\nin its import that we could confidently say that the jury applied\r\nthe correct rule of law, in spite of the error contained in the\r\noriginal instruction. Cf. Arthur D. Little, Inc. v. Dooyang Corp.,\r\nNo. 98-1010, slip op. at 13-14 (1st Cir. June 25, 1998) (\"We assume\r\nthe jury listens to and follows the judge's entire charge.\"\r\n(emphasis added)); Tatro v. Kervin, 41 F.3d 9, 18 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(reversing jury's verdict where a particular instruction, though\r\n\"standing alone, was proper,\" could have prejudiced appellant when\r\n\"taken together\" with certain other problematic language).\r\nIn its supplemental instruction, the court stated to the jury\r\nthat (a) \"the plaintiff . . . has the burden of establishing that\r\nit is more likely than not that gender was a motivating or\r\ndetermining factor in the firing of the plaintiff by the\r\ndefendant\"; (b) \"it is for the jury to determine . . . [whether] it\r\nis more likely than not that the defendant's decision to terminate\r\nthe plaintiff was motivated by gender discrimination\"; and (c) \"If\r\nyou find that the plaintiff was discharged for reasons other than\r\nhis gender you must find for the defendant.\"  This response, in my\r\nview, was not sufficient to obviate the prejudicial effect of the\r\ncourt's original instruction.\r\nAs the majority appears to agree, sentence (a) does not\r\naccurately describe the plaintiff's burden of proof under McDonnell\r\nDouglas and thus could not have been curative.\r\nSentence (b), considered in isolation, is not necessarily\r\ninconsistent with the established standards governing pretext\r\ncases, insofar as the \"motivated by\" formulation leaves open the\r\ncritical issue of how much of a causative role discrimination must\r\nhave played in the defendant's decisionmaking.  But because the\r\njury was never told that sentence (b) was to trump any conflicting\r\nstatements in the original instruction, we cannot realistically\r\nassume that the jury did consider that sentence in isolation from\r\nthe \"a motivating factor\" charge.  To the contrary, it only seems\r\nfair to presume that the jury's understanding of sentence (b) was\r\ncolored by the original \"a motivating factor\" instruction, and I do\r\nnot see how we can discount the possibility that the jury thought\r\nit could find that the defendant was \"motivated by\" discrimination\r\nso long as gender animus was \"a motivating factor.\"  In any event,\r\nI do not think it possible to conclude that the jury, by virtue of\r\nsentence (b), must have understood that it could return a\r\nplaintiff's verdict only if it found that discrimination had been\r\ndeterminative in the hospital's decision to fire Carey.\r\nTo a limited extent, sentence (c) might be thought to have\r\nlessened the prejudicial effect of the original instruction, by\r\nsuggesting to the jury that a defendant's verdict was in order ifthe jury could \"find\" that the plaintiff's discharge was caused, to\r\nsome unspecified degree, by nondiscriminatory reasons.  But this is\r\na far cry from saying that sentence (c) provided the jury with a\r\ncorrect understanding of the law.  Keeping in mind, again, that the\r\ndistrict court never told the jury to disregard the original \"a\r\nmotivating factor\" instruction, it would seem more than likely that\r\nthe jury understood the instructions, as a whole, to require it to\r\nreturn a verdict in Carey's favor if it found discrimination to be\r\n\"a motivating factor\" in his termination, unless   per sentence (c)\r\nit \"f[ou]nd\" that Carey was fired \"for reasons other than his\r\ngender.\"  This is, of course, an incorrect understanding of the\r\nlaw: a finding that discrimination was \"a motivating factor\" is\r\ninsufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's burden of proof in a\r\npretext case, regardless whether the jury could or could not \"find\"\r\nthat there were non-discriminatory reasons for the plaintiff's\r\ndischarge.  See Hicks, 509 U.S. at 523-24 (\"Title VII does not\r\naward damages against employers who cannot prove a\r\nnondiscriminatory reason for adverse employment action, but only\r\nagainst employers who are proven to have taken adverse employment\r\naction by reason of (in the context of the present case)\r\n[gender].\").\r\nThus, sentence (c), like (a) and (b), failed to provide the\r\njury with an adequate recitation of the legal standard governing\r\nthe plaintiff's burden of proof, and the supplemental instruction\r\ndid not cure the erroneous \"a motivating factor\" instruction.\r\n                          III.\r\nThe question remains whether MDI somehow waived any argument\r\nthat it was prejudiced by the district court's \"a motivating factor\"\r\njury instruction.  The majority makes much of the fact that, at a\r\nfew points in the colloquy following the jury's question, defense\r\ncounsel appeared to accede to the giving of the supplemental\r\ninstruction, and endorsed sentence (c) of that instruction in\r\nparticular.  It must be remembered, however, that this entire\r\ndiscussion was prompted by the jury's question about the meaning of\r\n\"motivating factor,\" a phrase that had been adopted by the district\r\ncourt only over the defendant's duly-lodged objection.  The\r\ncolloquy preceding the court's giving of the supplemental\r\ninstruction did not provide an apt occasion for MDI to reargue\r\nwhether it had been proper for the district court to give the \"a\r\nmotivating factor\" instruction in the first place.\r\nIt is only from this perspective that one can fairly\r\nunderstand what the majority refers to as MDI's \"affirmative[]\r\n. . . approval of the supplemental instruction.\"  In fact, in the\r\ncourse of finally acceding to the supplemental instruction   which,\r\nagain, was really a response to the jury's question about language\r\nin the original instruction to which MDI had already objected   MDI\r\nexpressly reserved its argument that the district court had\r\nincorrectly instructed the jury on the plaintiff's burden of proof. \r\nThis is what MDI's counsel actually said:\r\nalthough, you know, our position [is] that it should be\r\na 'determining/but for' standard, and I don't want to\r\nwaive that argument, I think that this [the court's\r\nproposed response to the jury] is acceptable in light of\r\nthe court's prior ruling.\r\n\nI can see nothing in this statement that compromised the\r\ndefendant's ability to argue, on appeal, that it was prejudiced by\r\nthe court's \"a motivating factor\" instruction.\r\nIt is true, as the majority observes, that MDI's counsel at\r\none point did explicitly endorse sentence (c) of the supplemental\r\ninstruction as a correct statement of the law.  I have tried to\r\nexplain above why I believe (c) was not a fully accurate statement. \r\nIt is a bit more difficult to say, however, just what effect MDI's\r\nconcession should have.  On the one hand, it certainly should bar\r\nMDI from arguing that the inclusion of sentence (c) in the\r\nsupplemental instruction was itself reversible error; but that is\r\nnot a position that MDI has taken in this appeal.  On the other\r\nhand, MDI's endorsement of sentence (c) surely cannot be taken as\r\na waiver of its argument that the \"a motivating factor\" instruction\r\nconstituted prejudicial error.  MDI's counsel at no time conceded\r\nthat the supplemental instruction, with or without sentence (c),\r\nwas sufficient to cure the asserted error in the original charge. \r\nIn fact, counsel explicitly noted for the record that the hospital\r\ndid not want to waive its original objection.\r\nIn these circumstances, I see no reason that the concession of\r\nMDI's counsel as to statement (c) should require this court, in\r\nassessing whether MDI was prejudiced by the \"a motivating factor\"\r\ncharge, to conclude that statement (c) effectively cured that\r\nerroneous instruction.  A contrary outcome, it seems to me, would\r\ncreate a rule of waiver that imposes on trial counsel a \"burden of\r\nperfection\" as \"unrealistic\" as the burden that the majority asserts\r\nwould befall the trial court if we were to call for a new trial in\r\nthis case.\r\nFor all of the reasons stated, I would vacate the judgment and\r\nremand this case for a new trial.\n",

Carey brought this\r\nsuit against Mt. Desert Island Hospital (\"MDI\") for gender\r\ndiscrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\r\n1964, 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2000e-17, and the Maine Human Rights Act,\r\n5 M.R.S.A.  4551-4632.  He alleged that he was discharged from\r\nhis position as Vice-President of Finance because he was male.  \r\nAfter a seven day trial, a jury returned a verdict in Carey's\r\nfavor, awarding compensatory and punitive damages of $210,000 and\r\n$400,000, respectively.  The district court reduced the $610,000 \r\ntotal to $200,000 to conform with the statutory cap for awards of\r\ncompensatory and punitive damages under Title VII.  See 42 U.S.C.\r\n1981a(b)(3)(C).  The court declined to award front pay, reasoning\r\nthat it was included under the statutory cap, and was inappropriate\r\nunder the circumstances of the case.  The court awarded back pay in\r\nthe amount of $110,070, making the total amount of recovery\r\n$310,070.\r\nThe parties cross-appealed, MDI attacking the verdict and\r\nCarey challenging the post-verdict rulings limiting his recovery. \r\nMDI appeals on five points:  (1) sufficiency of the evidence; (2) \r\njury instructions on the role of gender discrimination in the\r\ndecision to terminate; (3) peremptory challenges to four female \r\nprospective jurors; (4) admission of certain deposition evidence;\r\nand (5) admission of a remark by an MDI employee manifesting anti-\r\nmale animus.  Carey argues that the court erred in failing to award\r\nfront pay and in limiting the back pay award. \r\nOur review of the record reveals that this was a case with\r\nmuch to say on either side, involving the always difficult question\r\nof probing the wellsprings of human motivation.  Moreover, it was\r\nin our minds an exceptionally hard fought trial.  While the verdict\r\ncould have gone either way, our review persuades us that no error\r\nwas committed below such as to justify reversal.  We therefore\r\naffirm the judgments.\r\n             I. Sufficiency of the evidence\r\nTitle VII makes it unlawful, inter alia, to discharge any\r\nindividual because of his sex.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(a)(1). \r\nWhere the plaintiff must prove his case by circumstantial evidence\r\nin the absence of direct evidence, as here, \"the plaintiff must\r\nmake out a prima facie case of discrimination, the employer must\r\nthen come forward with some non-discriminatory justification, and\r\nthe plaintiff finally is given the opportunity to convince the\r\ntrier of fact that the justification was pretextual and that the\r\nreal reason was discriminatory.\"  Molloy v.

At all times, the plaintiff retains the\r\nburden of persuasion.  \r\nThere is no real dispute that Carey has established a prima\r\nfacie case, as he has shown that he had a satisfactory job\r\nperformance record but was terminated and replaced by a woman.

And MDI\r\nhas presented a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for\r\ntermination, namely, Carey's continued mismanagement of his\r\nfinancial responsibilities.  \r\nOur focus in determining whether or not there was sufficient\r\nevidence to justify the verdict therefore rests on the third stage\r\nof the Title VII analysis -- whether Carey introduced sufficient\r\nevidence to show that MDI's justification was false and that the\r\nreal reason for his discharge was gender.  Carey may rely on the\r\nsame evidence to prove pretext and discrimination.

Events leading to termination.  \r\nMDI is a thirty-nine bed community hospital in Bar Harbor,\r\nMaine, with approximately 200 employees.  In 1983, James Mroch, the\r\nHospital's CEO, hired Carey as Comptroller.  In 1991, Carey was\r\npromoted to Vice President of Finance.  His responsibilities\r\nincluded preparation of budgets and financial reports, working with\r\noutside auditors, service on various committees, including the\r\nManagement Committee, and supervision of the Hospital's accounting\r\nand business offices.\r\nThe critical period in this case begins in January 1993 and\r\nextends to June 1994.  In January 1993, MDI's Board of Trustees\r\ndischarged Mroch, and Dan Hobbs carried out the duties of CEO until\r\nSeptember of that year.  In the meantime, Lynda Tyson, who had\r\nbecome a Board member in 1989 and chairperson in 1993, engaged a\r\nprofessional recruiter, Anna Phillips, to find a permanent\r\nreplacement for Mroch.  Carey applied for the position but in June\r\nwas told he would not be considered further.  In July 1993, after\r\nits first choice, David Pagniucci, declined the offer, the Board\r\noffered the job to Leslie Hawkins. She accepted and commenced\r\nemployment in mid-September 1993.\r\nIn the interim, on April 30, 1993, MDI's new outside auditors,\r\nBerry, Dunn, McNeil &amp; Parker (\"Berry, Dunn\") prepared a \"1993\r\nManagement Letter\" reporting conditions observed during its end of\r\nthe fiscal year audit of MDI.  The letter contained, without\r\nspecific identification, both \"reportable conditions\" and \"other\r\nobservations.\"  \"Reportable conditions were defined as \"matters .\r\n. . relating to significant deficiencies in the design or operation\r\nof the internal control structure that, in our judgment, could\r\nadversely affect the Organization's ability to record, process,\r\nsummarize, and report financial data consistent with the assertions\r\nof management in the consolidated statements.\"\r\nShortly after Hawkins commenced her duties, in September 1993,\r\nTyson arranged a meeting with Hawkins, the Board, and the Berry,\r\nDunn auditors to discuss the Management Letter.  Carey was not\r\ninvited.  The auditors said that while the items in the letter were\r\nserious and needed to be addressed, the finance department, with\r\nsome assistance, should be able to rectify them before the next\r\naudit.\r\nIn April 1994, Hawkins asked Carey to present a proposed\r\nfiscal 1995 budget to the Board before April 30.  Realizing one\r\nweek before the deadline that he could not complete the assignment\r\nin time, Carey asked for and was granted a one month extension.  In\r\nMay, he submitted a budget, which projected large deficits and some\r\nhigh expenses.  Hawkins and MDI's finance committee found the\r\nproposal unacceptable and sent the budget back for reworking.\r\nIn June, Hawkins met with the Berry, Dunn auditors, who told\r\nher that the bulk of the deficiencies noted in the 1993 Management\r\nLetter were still present.  On June 23, Hawkins terminated Carey,\r\nfollowed soon by his female assistant, Robinson.  She gave as\r\nreasons the uncorrected problems noted in the 1993 Management\r\nLetter, lack of a budget, and lack of confidence in Carey and\r\nRobinson.  Hawkins advised Lynda Tyson, the Executive Committee,\r\nand the full Board; all supported her action.  \r\nB. Pretext. \r\nThe series of events and concerns described above indicates a\r\nvery legitimate, non-discriminatory justification for discharging\r\nCarey.  More than speculation or random evidence of satisfactory\r\nperformance is required to constitute a sufficient basis for a jury\r\nfinding that incompetency and mismanagement were not the real\r\nreason for the discharge.  Cf. Byrd, 61 F.3d at 1030 (addressing\r\nthe summary judgment context).  We therefore distill all the\r\nevidence that points to pretext.\r\nWe begin by examining Carey's work record.  In evaluating\r\nCarey in 1992, Mroch said:\r\nMike works very hard, adapts quickly to change, and keeps\r\ngoing even when doing so is difficult.  Mike has\r\nresponded very well to difficult situations brought about\r\nby various board members.  Mike's fiscal abilities are\r\nexcellent.\r\nMore recent and therefore more germane is Hobbs' recommendation to\r\nthe CEO Search Committee in June 1993 that Carey be considered for\r\nthe position of CEO:\r\nI have worked closely with Mike since early February\r\nduring this difficult budgeting process and Mike has\r\nshown great tact and diplomacy in negotiating with\r\ndepartment heads in an attempt to reduce the budget\r\nexpenses, particularly in payroll.  I have been very\r\nimpressed with the manner in which it was done and which\r\nmade the decision more acceptable by those directly\r\ninvolved.\r\nThen there is the key 1993 Management Letter itself.  What\r\nsounds like a massive indictment could have been read by a\r\nskeptical jury as a list of technical accounting recommendations to\r\nbe expected from a firm making its first impression on a client. \r\nCertainly, it appears difficult for a reader to distinguish what\r\nthe accountants deemed a fairly serious \"reportable condition\" from\r\none of the \"other observations.\"  The suggestions included\r\nrecording cash on hand to the general ledger, locking up the blank\r\nchecks, avoiding imposing too many payroll functions on a single\r\nindividual (i.e., using more personnel), retaining outpatient\r\nrecords, insuring loss of records, and use of disaggregated balance\r\nsheets to show that individual restricted funds are in monthly\r\nbalance.  \r\nA jury could reasonably conclude that nothing in this\r\nsuggested an alarming hazard or a smoking gun, such as that\r\nportrayed by Hawkins.  Indeed, at least five of the recommendations\r\nended with the observation that the finance staff was already\r\nattacking the problem.  Berry, Dunn highlighted that many balance\r\nsheet accounts were not regularly reconciled or analyzed, requiring\r\nthat numerous audit adjustments be made.  They also explained in\r\nconclusion:  \"This letter appears critical by its nature because it\r\nis intended to present suggestions for management's consideration. \r\nIt does not comment on the positive aspects we noted in the\r\nHospital's system of internal accounting control and procedures\r\nduring our engagement.\"\r\nEven more revealing may have been the auditors' June 21, 1994\r\nstatus letter prepared at Hawkins' request two days before Carey's\r\ndischarge.  This letter identified the areas listed in the 1993\r\nletter that remained problematic.  In contrast to normal practice,\r\nit was developed without input from Carey and his staff.  Berry,\r\nDunn auditors concluded that the bulk of deficiencies were still\r\npresent in 1994.  But upon a close reading of the 1993 and 1994\r\nletters the jury might have understood the letters quite\r\ndifferently.  \r\nThe 1993 letter occupied six pages and contained thirteen\r\nareas of criticism, whereas the 1994 letter had three pages, with\r\nfive surviving areas of criticism.  The remaining eight areas of\r\nreported deficiencies had been resolved, substantially improved,\r\nor, in one area, could not be addressed due to equipment\r\nmalfunction.  The principal remaining problem was inability to\r\nreconcile balance sheet accounts to supporting documentation. \r\nThis, of course, might have been a critical shortcoming, but the\r\njury need not have so concluded.  Such a status letter, even in the\r\nabsence of staff opportunity to defend and explain, might well have\r\nappeared to the jury as less than a clarion call for termination.\r\nThe jury also heard the testimony of Carey's expert witness,\r\nIsrael Laeger, senior member of a Bangor, Maine, accounting firm.\r\nLaeger had reviewed all CPA audits and management letters from 1990\r\nto 1995.  He pointed out that (1) a new accounting firm may seek to\r\nimpress a client with a sizeable list of criticisms; (2) \r\n\"reportable conditions\" are basically judgment calls that are the\r\nproduct of the accountant's subjective view of seriousness; (3) an\r\n\"opinion audit\" is one where the auditor can vouch for the accuracy\r\nof a financial statement; (4) a \"qualified opinion\" means that\r\nthere are some \"things not up to snuff\" preventing an unqualified\r\nopinion; (5) all the audit opinions of MDI were unqualified,\r\nmeaning that \"they were given a clean bill of health\"; and (6) the\r\nnumber of deficiencies identified in audit reports had steadily\r\ndecreased from 1992 to 1994.  Laeger concluded that nothing in the\r\naudit reports and letters indicated that Carey was not living up to\r\nhis responsibilities as Chief Financial Officer.\r\nFinally, the jury might have doubted the facial justifications\r\nadvanced by Hawkins concerning the relative infrequency of meetings\r\nbetween Hawkins and Carey, whose offices were in close proximity. \r\nAnd they may have suspected that she thwarted his ability to\r\nsucceed based on evidence that she refused to allow Carey to fill\r\nall the budgeted positions allotted him, did not give him any\r\nadvance warnings of serious trouble despite earlier assurance that\r\nshe would inform him if she had problems with his job performance,\r\nand the absense of any effort to institute \"progressive discipline\"\r\nor corrective action, as was general practice, before dismissal.\r\nWe therefore cannot say that disbelief of the reasons\r\nproffered by MDI would be unsupported or unfounded.\r\nC. Evidence of gender discrimination.  \r\nThis conclusion, however, would not be enough to support the\r\nverdict.  It may very well be that Hawkins, Tyson, and the entire\r\nBoard had come to the point where they did not like Carey's style,\r\nfinding him too openly critical of others and insensitive in his\r\npublic utterances.  If such were the real motivation for his\r\ndischarge, it might or might not be fair but certainly would not be\r\ndiscrimination prohibited by law.  It therefore was incumbent on\r\nCarey to introduce sufficient evidence to enable a reasonable jury\r\nto find that the justifications advanced by MDI for his discharge\r\nwere a cover for an underlying anti-male animus.\r\nIn a case such as this, where a plaintiff must rely on\r\ncircumstantial as opposed to direct evidence of gender\r\ndiscrimination, the evidence will necessarily be composed of bits\r\nand pieces, which may or may not point to an atmosphere of gender\r\ndiscrimination.  While an employer should not find itself in\r\njeopardy by reason of occasional stray remarks by ordinary\r\nemployees, \r\ncircumstantial evidence of a discriminatory atmosphere at\r\na plaintiff's place of employment is relevant to the\r\nquestion of motive in considering a discrimination claim.\r\n. . . [E]vidence of a corporate state-of-mind or a\r\ndiscriminatory atmosphere is not rendered irrelevant by\r\nits failure to coincide precisely with the particular\r\nactors or timeframe involved in the specific events that\r\ngenerated a claim of discriminatory treatment.\r\nConway v. Electro Switch Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492354\"><a href=\"/opinion/492354/sandra-conway-v-electro-switch-corp-sandra-conway-v-electro-switch/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 597-98 (1st Cir.\r\n1987)(citations omitted).\r\nThe record reveals the following evidence in support of \r\nBrennan's claim of sex based discriminatory animus:\r\n-- In August 1992, Fundraising and Public Relations Director\r\n(and member of the Management Committee) Carol Gordon had a\r\ndiscussion with Carey and another employee about a television\r\nprogram on child abuse at day care centers.  She concluded the\r\ndiscussion with, \"we live in a patriarchal society, and men shirk\r\ntheir duties toward child raising.  And because men have money,\r\npower and position, because they have penises, then this is the\r\ntype of thing that happens as a result.\"  Carey told Evans that the\r\nremarks were inappropriate and filed a sexual harassment complaint\r\nwith the Personnel Director, Penny Evans.  Shortly thereafter,\r\nEvans expressed regret to Carey that he had taken her remark the\r\nwrong way and that he had filed a complaint.\r\n-- In late 1992, the steering committee for MDI's new Women's\r\nHealth Center, whose members included Jeanne DuLong, Director of\r\nNursing, Evans, Gordon, and Carey (the only male), prepared a\r\nmission statement for the Center.  As first drafted, the statement\r\nbarred the employment of men, including male physicians.  Carey\r\nobjected to the draft, indicated it could be illegal and sought a\r\nlegal opinion.  After obtaining the opinion, the mission statement\r\nwas changed so as not to exclude men.\r\n-- In the spring of 1993, a management committee member, Brian\r\nMcCarthy, complained to Evans about another employee's having\r\nthrown water in his face.  He testified that Evans was not\r\nreceptive to his complaint, telling him not to worry about it. \r\nWhen he asked what she would do in the event water was thrown at a\r\nfemale employee, Evans said the person would probably be fired. \r\nShe explained, \"we have different standards for men and women.\"\r\n-- Tyson, then Vice-Chair of the Board, helped secure the\r\ndischarge of Mroch as President and CEO.  Upon his termination in\r\nearly 1993, she hired an executive search firm, placing Anna\r\nPhillips in charge of identifying a prospective CEO for MDI.  In\r\nthe summer of 1993, Gordon, Brian McCarthy, David Frongillo,\r\nDirector of the MDI Pharmacy, and Hawkins, who was then a\r\ncandidate, met with Phillips.  Frongillo asked if there was a\r\nselection criterion involving gender, to which Gordon responded,\r\n\"it's about time that we get a woman for this position,\" and\r\nPhillips said that \"they would very much like to put a woman in\r\nthat position.\"  Meanwhile, Carey's own application received short\r\nshrift.  He testified that Phillips interviewed him for only about\r\nthirty minutes, never asked about his qualifications, and appeared\r\nnot to have read his resume.  Tyson testified that Evans, DuLong,\r\nand Gordon had all told her that they would not be \"comfortable\r\nwith Mr. Carey as CEO.\" \r\n-- By the time Hawkins was hired, Tyson and Gordon were close\r\nfriends, as were Evans and Gordon, and all were uncomfortable with\r\nCarey.  When Hawkins was hired, Tyson told her that she faced\r\nseveral challenges, \"one of which was the financial stability and\r\n. . . that she might have some problems in the finance department.\" \r\n-- In late 1993, MDI conducted an employee opinion survey, a\r\nsummary of which was placed in an administrative mailbox used by\r\nboth Carey and Hawkins.  Although obviously intended for Hawkins,\r\nCarey saw the responses and noted on the summary page a statement\r\nfrom an unnamed employee that Hawkins needed to take action against\r\n\"the power-hungry men in administration.\"  Although the comment\r\nitself is entitled to little weight, that this message was intended\r\nfor administration eyes and that the compiler of the survey results\r\nsaw fit to place the comment on the summary page for Hawkins are\r\nmore significant.\r\n-- Finally, Carey, when facing performance problems, appears\r\nto have been treated differently by Hawkins than were Evans,\r\nGordon, and DuLong.  Although only Carey and DuLong were Vice-\r\nPresidents, the other two were senior managers and all served on\r\nthe Management Committee.  \"The test is whether a prudent person,\r\nlooking objectively at the incidents, would think them roughly\r\nequivalent and the protagonists similarly situated. . . . Exact\r\ncorrelation is neither likely nor necessary, but the cases must be\r\nfair congeners.\"  Molloy, 115 F.3d at 91 (quoting Dartmouth Review\r\nv. Dartmouth College, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 19 (1st Cir. 1989)).  All three\r\nwomen had encountered problems in their jobs and were given\r\n\"progressive discipline,\" i.e., assistance and time to take\r\ncorrective action, rather than prompt termination.\r\nMDI in its briefs and argument compartmentalizes the above\r\nevidence, isolating each incident, relationship, or statement,\r\narguing that each has no bearing on any animus that could have\r\ninfluenced Hawkins.  But all of the evidence was presented to the\r\njury and we would find it very difficult indeed to say that the\r\ntotality fell below a triable threshold.  The statements and\r\nincidents did not relate to miscellaneous low level employees but\r\nto a fairly tight group of top officials.  We therefore hold that\r\nthere was sufficient evidence to support a finding that\r\ndeficiencies in Carey's handling of financial controls were not the\r\nreal reason for his discharge but instead covered an action\r\nstemming from gender discrimination.    \r\nWe see no point in separately analyzing the court's refusal to\r\norder a new trial.  As is evident from our discussion on the \r\nsufficiency of the evidence, we do not consider the court's action\r\nto be an abuse of discretion.  See Simon v. Navon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196426\"><a href=\"/opinion/196426/simon-ii-v-navon/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13\r\n(1st Cir. 1995).\r\n                 II. Jury Instructions\r\nMDI argues that the court in its original jury instructions\r\ncommitted error by charging that the plaintiff had the burden of\r\nshowing by a preponderance of the evidence that \"gender was a\r\nmotivating factor\" in MDI's decision to fire him.  It had urged the\r\ncourt to use the words \"a determining factor\" or \"the motivating\r\nfactor,\" reasoning that, in cases resting on circumstantial rather\r\nthan direct evidence, such language should be used to accord with\r\nour opinions in LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"654585\"><a href=\"/opinion/654585/theodore-l-leblanc-v-great-american-insurance-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n842, 846 (1st Cir. 1993), and Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828 (1st Cir. 1991). \r\nThe court resisted, observing that in LeBlanc and other First\r\nCircuit cases we have used both \"motivating\" and \"determining\"\r\nwithout any clear indication that one was preferable.  The court\r\nwas persuaded that \"a motivating factor\" was the correct\r\ninstruction by the wording chosen by Congress in Section 107(a) of\r\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991, an amendment to the Civil Rights Act\r\nof 1964.  Section 107(a), codified as 42  2000e-2(m), states, \"an\r\nunlawful employment practice is established when the complaining\r\nparty demonstrates that . . . sex . . . was a motivating factor for\r\nany employment practice, even though other factors also motivated\r\nthe practice.\"\r\nMDI argues that the court misapplied 42  2000e-2(m), which it\r\nmaintains covers direct but not circumstantial evidence cases,  and\r\ntherefore committed reversible error.  What MDI has not adverted to\r\nin its brief was that after the jury had been out for about ninety\r\nminutes, the jury sent the court a note asking for a legal\r\ndefinition of \"motivating factor\" with specific reference to \"how\r\nmuch weight is to be rendered to make decision.\"  What followed\r\nwas, in our opinion, of crucial importance insofar as decision in\r\nthis case is concerned.\r\nCourt and counsel proceeded to engage in a substantial\r\ncolloquy, spanning eighteen pages of transcript.  After hearing\r\nargument from counsel, the court dictated a draft supplemental\r\ninstruction, which read in relevant part:\r\nThe plaintiff therefore has the burden of establishing\r\nthat it is more likely than not that gender was a\r\nmotivating or determining factor in the firing of the\r\nplaintiff by the defendant.  In other words, it is for\r\nthe jury to determine, based on all the evidence, that it\r\nis more likely than not that the defendant's decision to\r\nterminate the plaintiff was motivated by gender\r\ndiscrimination.  If you find that the plaintiff was\r\ndischarged for reasons other than his gender you must\r\nfind for the defendant.\r\nAt this juncture, Carey's counsel proposed adding, at the end\r\nof the first sentence, \"even though other factors also motivated\r\nthe practice.\"  The court expressed concern that the proposed\r\naddition \"conveys an impression that they need not concern\r\nthemselves with what really caused the termination.  As long as\r\nthere's a drop of causal effect by any of these factors in the mix,\r\nthey can find for the plaintiff.\" \r\nCarey's counsel then tried to persuade the judge to drop the\r\nlast sentence.  Before doing so, the court called upon MDI's\r\ncounsel to weigh in on the proposed language.  MDI's counsel \r\nresponded as follows:\r\nMR.. JOHNSTON:  Well, I think that last sentence is a\r\nperfectly accurate statement of the law, and I don't\r\nthink it's misleading at all.\r\n\nMS. FARRELL (co-counsel): It does balance out the rest of\r\nit.\r\nAfter the court refused a request by Carey's counsel to add that\r\ngender discrimination need not be the sole motivating factor, the\r\ncourt accepted the draft supplemental instruction, unchanged. \r\nWe are aware of the controversy that exists over whether the\r\n\"a motivating factor\" language in 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(m) applies to\r\nall discrimination cases, as the language indicates, or was\r\nintended only to overrule in part the standard set forth in Price\r\nWaterhouse v. Hopkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112252\"><a href=\"/opinion/112252/price-waterhouse-v-hopkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989).  If the latter is true,\r\nas MDI maintains, then the amendment is limited to \"direct\r\nevidence/mixed motive\" cases and leaves unscathed the McDonnell\r\nDouglas approach to \"circumstantial evidence/pretext\" cases.  We\r\nsee no need to enter this thicket at the moment.  For the purposes\r\nof this case we assume that the court's original instruction was in\r\nerror.\r\nBut we look upon the court's colloquy with counsel, the\r\nsupplemental instruction, and the input from counsel as a thorough\r\nand effective effort to clarify an earlier misunderstanding.  The\r\nfirst sentence of the supplemental instruction, it is true, does\r\nnot specify what factor is determinative.  But the second sentence,\r\nbeginning with \"in other words,\" narrows the meaning, clarifying\r\nthat the decision must have been motivated by gender.  If any doubt\r\nwere to remain, the last sentence clearly conveys the thought that\r\nthe defendant escapes liability unless the plaintiff establishes\r\nthat the sole motivation was gender.  Indeed, if anything, this\r\nwording favors defendant more than it should, for it goes beyond\r\nthe concept of \"determining,\" requiring that if any reason other\r\nthan gender played, however minimal, a part in the discharge, Carey\r\nmay not recover.\r\nTo cap all this, both counsel for MDI affirmatively indicated\r\ntheir approval of the supplemental instruction to the court.  In\r\nour opinion, to hold under these circumstances that the trial court\r\ncommitted reversible error would impose an unrealistic burden of\r\nperfection on a court facing the constant pressures of trial.\r\n               III.  Miscellaneous Issues\r\nAs a very small tail on a very long dog, several other issues\r\nraised by MDI may be touched upon briefly.  The first is that\r\nCarey's counsel, by peremptorily challenging four female potential\r\njurors, and indicating that he was, in so doing, relying on a juror\r\nrating system which consisted of such factors as occupation,\r\neducation, and familiarity with the local region, violated the\r\nteaching of Batson v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986).  Inasmuch as\r\nMDI challenged three males and one female, the jury as drawn\r\ncontained five men and five women, and, after Carey offered his\r\nrating system explanation, MDI indicated to the court that it had\r\nno more questions on the Batson issue, we find it difficult to find\r\nthat the court abused its discretion in not pursuing explanations\r\nany further.\r\nMDI also claims error in the admission into evidence of\r\ndeposition testimony of Anna Phillips, which allegedly included \r\nhearsay and irrelevant material.  MDI makes cursory reference in\r\nits brief to \"feminist\" beliefs of members of the search committee,\r\narguing that these were not relevant to the present case.  We\r\nconfess ourselves unable, upon a thorough search of the record, to\r\nidentify such material in Phillips' testimony.  In any event, we \r\ncannot believe that in this lengthy trial discussion by Phillips of\r\n\"feminist\" beliefs held by persons at MDI could have made any\r\nimpact.  No case of reversible error has been made to us.  \r\nWe find the same as to certain notes of Phillips that were not\r\nadmitted into evidence but allowed to be shown in an overhead\r\nprojector.  MDI tells us they were \"inherently unreliable,\r\nprejudicial and irrelevant.\"  But we are not told just what they\r\nwere and how they would have adversely impacted MDI.  We expect\r\nmore from counsel serious about asserting reversible error.\r\nFinally, MDI claims error in admitting over objection Gordon's\r\n\"penis and power\" comment, with which we commenced our search for\r\ngender discriminatory indicia.  The specific claim is that the\r\nprejudicial effect of the comment greatly outweighed its probative\r\nvalue.  Were this an isolated remark or incident, this would be a\r\nmore viable argument.  But in context, particularly in light of the\r\nevidence of Gordon's close friendship with Tyson and her senior\r\nposition in management, we simply cannot say that the court abused\r\nits discretion in admitting the evidence.  To ask for a new trial\r\non the basis of this ruling strains our credulity.\r\n               IV.  Front and Back Pay\r\nCarey appeals the denial of front pay and the partial\r\nreduction of his back pay award for failure to mitigate damages. \r\nWe review the district court's decision to deny these awards for an\r\nabuse of discretion.  See Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732463\"><a href=\"/opinion/732463/72-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1457-69-empl-prac-dec-p-44463-mary-jane/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12-13 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"[t]rial courts have discretion to\r\nfashion awards in Title VII cases so as to fully compensate a\r\nplaintiff in a manner that suits the specific facts of the case\"). \r\nCarey alleges error in the court's conclusion that front pay\r\nwas included under the statutory cap, see 42 U.S.C. \r\n1981a(b)(3)(C), and that such an award was unnecessary given other\r\nrelief granted Carey.  We elect not to address the statutory cap\r\nissue as we find the district court's determination that Carey\r\nreceived sufficient compensation without front pay to be entirely\r\nwithin the court's discretion.     \r\nThe court addressed the merits of Carey's front pay request on\r\ntwo occasions.  On November 20, 1996, after receiving briefing from\r\nboth parties on the front pay issue, the court ruled that front pay\r\nis included under the statutory cap and \r\nin any event, the Court would be reluctant to award\r\nadditional front pay in this case because of the\r\nsubstantial liquidated damages awarded by the jury . . .\r\n[A]ny additional award of front pay would be\r\ninappropriate under the circumstances of this case. \r\nWildman v. Lerner Stores Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"457690\"><a href=\"/opinion/457690/mark-wildman-v-lerner-stores-corporation-mark-wildman-v-lerner-stores/\"><span class=\"volume\">771</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 616 (1stCir. 1985) [finding that future damages were unnecessary,\r\ngiven that the plaintiff had been awarded compensatory\r\ndamages, liquidated damages, and double and additional\r\ndamages under state law].\r\n\nAnd on February 20, 1997, the court denied Carey's motion to\r\nreconsider, stating, \r\n[w]hether front pay is included under the statutory cap\r\nor not, the Court indicated that it would not award\r\nPlaintiff front pay in this case.  The $200,000 in\r\ndamages Plaintiff will recover after the jury's award of\r\n$610,000 is capped, plus the back pay the Court will\r\naward Plaintiff, the exact amount of which is still\r\nuncertain, will more than adequately compensate\r\nplaintiff.\r\n\nWe discern from these statements that the court appears to\r\nhave looked to the jury's award of punitive damages rather than to\r\nthe statutorily capped damage award in denying front pay on\r\nNovember 20, 1996.  While this was inappropriate as the liquidated\r\ndamages award was not an accurate measure of the award Carey would\r\nactually receive, it is clear that on February 20, 1997, the court\r\nfound the $200,000 cap and back pay award fully sufficient to\r\ncompensate Carey.  This determination, standing alone, is entirely\r\nsupportable, and we can see no basis to conclude, as Carey would\r\nhave us do, that it was \"tainted\" by the November 20, 1996 ruling. \r\nWe can find no \"strong evidence of a lapse in judgment,\"  Selgas,\r\n104 F.3d at 12, as required for a finding of an abuse of\r\ndiscretion. \r\nNeither can we discern an abuse of discretion as to the back\r\npay award.  Carey was entitled to recover for what he would have\r\nearned absent the discharge, reduced by any compensation that he\r\nactually received and any additional amount that he would have\r\nreceived through reasonable efforts to mitigate the damages, with\r\nthe employer bearing the burden of proof on the issue of\r\nmitigation.  See Troy, 141 F.3d at 382; Wilcox v. Stratton Lumber,\r\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1988562\"><a href=\"/opinion/1988562/wilcox-v-stratton-lumber-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 842 (D. Me. 1996); 42 U.S.C.  2000e-\r\n5(g)(1).  \r\nCorrectly applying this standard, the court concluded that MDI\r\nhad successfully shown through expert testimony and evidence\r\nconcerning the actual number of applications made relative to the\r\nnumber of positions available that Carey did not exercise\r\nreasonable diligence in seeking comparable employment.  The result\r\nwas an award to Carey of $110,070 in back pay, which represented a\r\nreduction by $100,000 for failure to fully mitigate damages and a\r\nreduction by the amount of money Carey earned or received in\r\nunemployment during the relevant period.  \r\nIn support of his abuse of discretion argument, Carey\r\nessentially repeats the evidence he presented below, relying\r\nparticularly on testimony from his expert to rebut evidence by\r\nMDI's expert.  We see no need to pursue this further.  The court's\r\norder demonstrates a thoughtful weighing of the credibility of the\r\nwitnesses and the various evidence presented by each party,\r\nresulting in an award that was somewhere in between that desired by\r\neach party.  Such weighing was fully within the court's discretion\r\nand is supported by the evidence.  V.  Conclusion\r\n We therefore affirm the district court on all issues raised\r\nby both parties on appeal.  Each party shall pay its own costs.\r\n                         Concurrence and dissent follow.     ALDRICH, Senior Circuit Judge, concurring.  The difficulty of\r\nthe issue that principally divides the court is indicated by the\r\nfact that discussion of the jury's question that led to a three\r\nsentence supplemental instruction, occupies 18 pages of transcript. \r\nMy disagreement with our dissenting brother is based on my\r\nassessment of the jury's thinking as  shown by its question, and my\r\nbelief that if a jury hears twice from the same source it is likely\r\nto emphasize, if not concentrate on, what it has last heard.\r\nThe jury's question is interesting.  We do not have the exact\r\nlanguage, but it appears to have requested a legal definition of\r\n\"motivating factor,\" and \"how much weight is to be rendered to make\r\na decision?\"  Since it had been instructed as to what is generally\r\nneeded to meet the burden of proof I assume great thought went into\r\nthis question: Is it enough for gender to be a concurrent factor,\r\nor does motivating require sufficient weight to itself effect the\r\ndecision?  This last is what it was told.  What the dissent labels\r\nas part (b) of the court's response to the question, \"not\r\nnecessarily inconsistent with the established standards governing\r\npretext cases,\" (a bit overgrudging, I prefer \"consistent\" to not\r\n\"necessarily inconsistent\") the dissent would diminish because\r\npresumably \"colored by the original 'a motivating factor'\r\ninstruction.\"  But was it not just because the jury was not\r\nsatisfied by the original instruction that it asked for\r\nillumination?  With great respect, is it not unfair to say that the\r\nquestioned shadow persisted?  I say particularly unfair when\r\ndefendant's last remark was an assent.  The jury had received an\r\napparently full answer to its question, and I do not believe it is\r\nto be thought to have reached back and modified it by what had\r\nbothered it before.  I read (b) and (c) together as understood to\r\nmean that plaintiff must show that discrimination was of sufficient\r\nweight to itself warrant the discharge, and it was in fact the\r\nactivating cause.  To this defendant can have no complaint.     STAHL, Circuit Judge, dissenting.  The majority \"assume[s],\"\r\nfor purposes of analysis, that the district court's original charge\r\nwas in error, but concludes that its response to the jury's\r\nquestion about the meaning of the erroneous \"motivating factor\"\r\ninstruction was fully curative, and/or that MDI's counsel waived\r\nits objection by acceding to a portion of the court's supplemental\r\ninstruction.  Because I cannot agree that the defendant hospital\r\neither waived its objection to or was not prejudiced by the\r\nerroneous instruction, and because I believe it important to\r\nexplain why the original instruction was erroneous, I respectfully\r\ndissent.\r\n                           I.\r\nEmployment discrimination cases involving claims of disparate\r\ntreatment can be divided into two broad categories: (1) cases in\r\nwhich the plaintiff has \"direct\" evidence of discrimination, and (2)\r\ncases in which the plaintiff's evidence of discrimination is\r\n\"indirect.\"  See, e.g., Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196571\"><a href=\"/opinion/196571/smith-v-fw-morse-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  Under prevailing law, the proper\r\ncharacterization of a plaintiff's case as direct or indirect\r\nlargely determines the manner in which the plaintiff may establish\r\nthe defendant's liability.\r\nWhere the plaintiff's proof is indirect (as will typically be\r\nthe case), the plaintiff's claim normally will be adjudicated in\r\naccordance with the familiar rules laid out in the line of cases\r\nbeginning with McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Under the Price Waterhouse rule, if a plaintiff\r\nintroduced direct evidence of discrimination sufficient to\r\ndemonstrate (by a preponderance of the evidence) that an\r\nimpermissible consideration (race, gender, etc.) was a motivating\r\nfactor in the contested job action, the burden of proof then\r\nshifted to the defendant to prove that it would have taken the same\r\njob action against the plaintiff even absent the impermissible\r\nmotivating factor.  See Jackson, 900 F.2d at 467.  If the defendant\r\nsucceeded in so proving, it avoided liability altogether.

Section 107(a) of the\r\n1991 Act provided the following:\r\nExcept as otherwise provided in this title, an unlawful\r\nemployment practice is established when the complaining\r\nparty demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or\r\nnational origin was a motivating factor for any\r\nemployment practice, even though other factors also\r\nmotivated the practice.\r\n\n1991 Act, Pub.

Section 107 thus abrogates the holding of\r\nPrice Waterhouse, insofar as that decision permitted an employer\r\nwith \"mixed motives\" to avoid liability altogether by proving that\r\nit would have taken the same job action against the plaintiff\r\nabsent any impermissible motivation.  Under Section 107, such proof\r\nby an employer does not provide a basis for avoiding liability, but\r\ndoes preclude any recovery of damages by the plaintiff and also\r\nbars certain important forms of injunctive relief, including\r\nreinstatement.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(2)(B)(ii).\r\nWhile it is clear, then, that Section 107 displaces the rule\r\nof Price Waterhouse, it is less clear whether Section 107 should\r\nhave any application in cases traditionally litigated under\r\nMcDonnell Douglas.  The conceptual problem arises from the fact\r\nthat the \"a motivating factor\" rubric of  2000e-2(m)   which was\r\nincorporated in the district court's instructions here   is\r\ndirectly at odds with the established understanding of the\r\nplaintiff's burden of proof in the McDonnell Douglas framework,\r\nparticularly as delineated in cases like St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.\r\nHicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506-07 (1993).\r\nWithin the McDonnell Douglas framework, a plaintiff bears the\r\nultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the\r\ndefendant's proffered reasons for the challenged job action are a\r\npretext for discrimination, i.e., that the \"true reason\" for the\r\ndecision was discriminatory.

Certainly, proving that discrimination\r\nwas just one motivating factor among other, nondiscriminatory\r\nfactors   which is all that is required to prove liability under\r\n2000e-2(m)   cannot suffice to establish that the discriminatory\r\nmotive was causally determinative, and hence cannot be enough to\r\nestablish liability and a right to recovery under McDonnell\r\nDouglas.

If  2000e-2(m) applied to every disparate\r\ntreatment case, then  2000e-5(g)(2)(B) would be triggered in every\r\nsuch case in which the plaintiff prevailed (since the prevailing\r\nplaintiff necessarily would have proved a violation under  2000e-\r\n2(m)).  As noted above,  2000e-5(g)(2)(B) permits a defendant to\r\navoid damages and certain other consequences by demonstrating that\r\nit would have \"taken the same action\" absent a discriminatory\r\nmotive.  42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(g)(2)(B).  But in cases where a\r\nplaintiff has prevailed under McDonnell Douglas, the factfinder\r\nnecessarily will have found that discrimination was the \"true\r\nreason\" for the defendant's action.  See, e.g., Hicks, 509 U.S. at\r\n507-08.  In such cases, it would be absurd to ask the factfinder\r\nalso to determine, as  2000e-5(g)(2)(B) would require, whether the\r\ndefendant would have \"taken the same action\" absent a discriminatory\r\nmotive.\r\nThe most plausible way to resolve the apparent conflict\r\nbetween  2000e-2(m) and McDonnell Douglas is to limit the\r\napplication of  2000e-2(m) to \"mixed motive\" cases that fit the\r\nPrice Waterhouse mold (cases in which the plaintiff has \"direct\r\nevidence\" of discrimination), and hold it inapplicable in \"pretext\"\r\ncases governed by McDonnell Douglas.  This is a more sensible\r\nsolution, in any event, than drawing the conclusion that Congress,\r\nin enacting  2000e-2(m), intended effectively to abrogate the\r\ncentral tenets of the McDonnell Douglas canon.\r\nThe legislative history of the 1991 Act indicates that Section\r\n107 was specifically intended to address the Supreme Court's\r\nholding in Price Waterhouse with respect to the standards of proof\r\ngoverning liability in \"mixed motive\" cases.  See H.R. Rep.

Under this reasoning, a district court\r\nerrs by giving a jury instruction pursuant to  2000e-2(m), unless\r\nthe court determines that the plaintiff has adduced evidence of\r\ndiscrimination sufficient to take the case outside the McDonnell\r\nDouglas paradigm, and I would so hold.\r\nHere, neither party has argued   and the district court never\r\nruled   that this case is anything but a standard \"pretext\" case\r\ngoverned by the principles of McDonnell Douglas.  Yet, the\r\ndistrict court, explicitly relying on 42 U.S.C.  2000e-2(m),\r\ninstructed the jury that the plaintiff's burden was merely to prove\r\nthat his gender was \"a motivating factor\" in MDI's decision to fire\r\nhim.  I would find (as the majority \"assumes\" without deciding)\r\nthat MDI's objection to this instruction was well-founded.  By\r\ninstructing the jury that Carey was entitled to prevail upon a\r\nfinding that discrimination had been merely \"a motivating factor\"\r\nin MDI's decision to terminate him, the district court erroneously\r\nunderstated the plaintiff's burden of proof under the governing\r\nlegal framework.\r\n                          II.\r\nBut instructional error warrants reversal, of course, only if\r\nit was prejudicial.  See Federico v.

The court's original \"a motivating factor\"\r\ninstruction, standing alone, unquestionably prejudiced the\r\ndefendant by materially understating the plaintiff's true burden of\r\nproof.  The majority does not dispute this fact.  The majority\r\nconcludes, however, that the district court effectively cured the\r\nerror in its original instruction with its response to the jury's\r\nquestion about the meaning of \"motivating factor.\"  I disagree.\r\nAs a preliminary matter, it is important to understand that\r\nthe court's so-called \"supplemental instruction\" was, at best, just\r\nthat   a supplement to the original instruction, given in response\r\nto a question that came from the jury after it had already retired\r\nto deliberate.  The court at no time instructed the jury that the\r\noriginal \"a motivating factor\" charge was incorrect, to be\r\ndisregarded, or in any way problematic.  Nor did the court advise\r\nthe jury that the supplemental instruction, to the extent it might\r\nhave been read as contradicting the original charge, was to be\r\ngiven precedence.  Thus, in assessing the question of prejudice, we\r\nmust ask not simply whether the supplemental instruction itself\r\nprovided an accurate statement of the law (a question I would\r\nanswer in the negative, see infra), but whether that instruction  \r\neven if it was correct   was sufficiently overriding and forceful\r\nin its import that we could confidently say that the jury applied\r\nthe correct rule of law, in spite of the error contained in the\r\noriginal instruction.

[whether] it\r\nis more likely than not that the defendant's decision to terminate\r\nthe plaintiff was motivated by gender discrimination\"; and (c) \"If\r\nyou find that the plaintiff was discharged for reasons other than\r\nhis gender you must find for the defendant.\"  This response, in my\r\nview, was not sufficient to obviate the prejudicial effect of the\r\ncourt's original instruction.\r\nAs the majority appears to agree, sentence (a) does not\r\naccurately describe the plaintiff's burden of proof under McDonnell\r\nDouglas and thus could not have been curative.\r\nSentence (b), considered in isolation, is not necessarily\r\ninconsistent with the established standards governing pretext\r\ncases, insofar as the \"motivated by\" formulation leaves open the\r\ncritical issue of how much of a causative role discrimination must\r\nhave played in the defendant's decisionmaking.  But because the\r\njury was never told that sentence (b) was to trump any conflicting\r\nstatements in the original instruction, we cannot realistically\r\nassume that the jury did consider that sentence in isolation from\r\nthe \"a motivating factor\" charge.  To the contrary, it only seems\r\nfair to presume that the jury's understanding of sentence (b) was\r\ncolored by the original \"a motivating factor\" instruction, and I do\r\nnot see how we can discount the possibility that the jury thought\r\nit could find that the defendant was \"motivated by\" discrimination\r\nso long as gender animus was \"a motivating factor.\"  In any event,\r\nI do not think it possible to conclude that the jury, by virtue of\r\nsentence (b), must have understood that it could return a\r\nplaintiff's verdict only if it found that discrimination had been\r\ndeterminative in the hospital's decision to fire Carey.\r\nTo a limited extent, sentence (c) might be thought to have\r\nlessened the prejudicial effect of the original instruction, by\r\nsuggesting to the jury that a defendant's verdict was in order ifthe jury could \"find\" that the plaintiff's discharge was caused, to\r\nsome unspecified degree, by nondiscriminatory reasons.  But this is\r\na far cry from saying that sentence (c) provided the jury with a\r\ncorrect understanding of the law.  Keeping in mind, again, that the\r\ndistrict court never told the jury to disregard the original \"a\r\nmotivating factor\" instruction, it would seem more than likely that\r\nthe jury understood the instructions, as a whole, to require it to\r\nreturn a verdict in Carey's favor if it found discrimination to be\r\n\"a motivating factor\" in his termination, unless   per sentence (c)\r\nit \"f[ou]nd\" that Carey was fired \"for reasons other than his\r\ngender.\"  This is, of course, an incorrect understanding of the\r\nlaw: a finding that discrimination was \"a motivating factor\" is\r\ninsufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's burden of proof in a\r\npretext case, regardless whether the jury could or could not \"find\"\r\nthat there were non-discriminatory reasons for the plaintiff's\r\ndischarge.  See Hicks, 509 U.S. at 523-24 (\"Title VII does not\r\naward damages against employers who cannot prove a\r\nnondiscriminatory reason for adverse employment action, but only\r\nagainst employers who are proven to have taken adverse employment\r\naction by reason of (in the context of the present case)\r\n[gender].\").\r\nThus, sentence (c), like (a) and (b), failed to provide the\r\njury with an adequate recitation of the legal standard governing\r\nthe plaintiff's burden of proof, and the supplemental instruction\r\ndid not cure the erroneous \"a motivating factor\" instruction.\r\n                          III.\r\nThe question remains whether MDI somehow waived any argument\r\nthat it was prejudiced by the district court's \"a motivating factor\"\r\njury instruction.  The majority makes much of the fact that, at a\r\nfew points in the colloquy following the jury's question, defense\r\ncounsel appeared to accede to the giving of the supplemental\r\ninstruction, and endorsed sentence (c) of that instruction in\r\nparticular.  It must be remembered, however, that this entire\r\ndiscussion was prompted by the jury's question about the meaning of\r\n\"motivating factor,\" a phrase that had been adopted by the district\r\ncourt only over the defendant's duly-lodged objection.  The\r\ncolloquy preceding the court's giving of the supplemental\r\ninstruction did not provide an apt occasion for MDI to reargue\r\nwhether it had been proper for the district court to give the \"a\r\nmotivating factor\" instruction in the first place.\r\nIt is only from this perspective that one can fairly\r\nunderstand what the majority refers to as MDI's \"affirmative[]\r\n. . . approval of the supplemental instruction.\"  In fact, in the\r\ncourse of finally acceding to the supplemental instruction   which,\r\nagain, was really a response to the jury's question about language\r\nin the original instruction to which MDI had already objected   MDI\r\nexpressly reserved its argument that the district court had\r\nincorrectly instructed the jury on the plaintiff's burden of proof. \r\nThis is what MDI's counsel actually said:\r\nalthough, you know, our position [is] that it should be\r\na 'determining/but for' standard, and I don't want to\r\nwaive that argument, I think that this [the court's\r\nproposed response to the jury] is acceptable in light of\r\nthe court's prior ruling.\r\n\nI can see nothing in this statement that compromised the\r\ndefendant's ability to argue, on appeal, that it was prejudiced by\r\nthe court's \"a motivating factor\" instruction.\r\nIt is true, as the majority observes, that MDI's counsel at\r\none point did explicitly endorse sentence (c) of the supplemental\r\ninstruction as a correct statement of the law.  I have tried to\r\nexplain above why I believe (c) was not a fully accurate statement. \r\nIt is a bit more difficult to say, however, just what effect MDI's\r\nconcession should have.  On the one hand, it certainly should bar\r\nMDI from arguing that the inclusion of sentence (c) in the\r\nsupplemental instruction was itself reversible error; but that is\r\nnot a position that MDI has taken in this appeal.  On the other\r\nhand, MDI's endorsement of sentence (c) surely cannot be taken as\r\na waiver of its argument that the \"a motivating factor\" instruction\r\nconstituted prejudicial error.  MDI's counsel at no time conceded\r\nthat the supplemental instruction, with or without sentence (c),\r\nwas sufficient to cure the asserted error in the original charge. \r\nIn fact, counsel explicitly noted for the record that the hospital\r\ndid not want to waive its original objection.\r\nIn these circumstances, I see no reason that the concession of\r\nMDI's counsel as to statement (c) should require this court, in\r\nassessing whether MDI was prejudiced by the \"a motivating factor\"\r\ncharge, to conclude that statement (c) effectively cured that\r\nerroneous instruction.  A contrary outcome, it seems to me, would\r\ncreate a rule of waiver that imposes on trial counsel a \"burden of\r\nperfection\" as \"unrealistic\" as the burden that the majority asserts\r\nwould befall the trial court if we were to call for a new trial in\r\nthis case.\r\nFor all of the reasons stated, I would vacate the judgment and\r\nremand this case for a new trial.\n</pre>",
