The present appeal arises out of\r                                      \r\n\na federal securities lawsuit filed by Cooperativa de Ahorro y\r\n\nCredito Aguada (\"Cooperativa\").  Cooperativa is a small, one-\r\n\nbranch  savings and  loan  \"cooperative\" located  in  Aguada,\r\n\nPuerto Rico.   Between  June and  December 1986,  Cooperativa\r\n\npurchased  $3.5  million  in  Drexel  Burnham  Lambert  \"unit\r\n\ntrusts,\"  securities representing  participations in  several\r\n\ntrusts whose  assets were  corporate bonds.   The  securities\r\n\nwere  purchased  at  the  recommendation  of  Ramon  Almonte,\r\n\nCooperativa's broker at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. (\"Kidder\").\r\n\n     According  to  Cooperativa,  Almonte  told  it  that the\r\n\nsecurities   were   a   low-risk,   safe  and   unspeculative\r\n\ninvestment,  that the  securities  were  not  redeemable  for\r\n\nanother seven to ten years and that a steady stream of income\r\n\nat  favorable  interest   rates  could  be  expected.     The\r\n\nsecurities were in fact backed by low-rated or unrated \"junk\"\r\n\nbonds bearing  high interest rates;  and if the value  of the\r\n\nbonds fell drastically,  the trustees had power  to terminate\r\n\nthe trusts.   Allegedly, Almonte disclosed neither  the risky\r\n\ncharacter of the bonds nor the termination provision.\r\n\n     In the course of its 1986 purchases of the securities in\r\n\nquestion, Cooperativa received confirmation slips that stated\r\n\nthat prospectuses were being forwarded  under separate cover.\r\n\nNo prospectus  covering  these securities  ever  arrived  and\r\n\nCooperativa did  not request copies.   Cooperativa's officers\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nwere admittedly  unsophisticated in financial matters.   Over\r\n\nthe  year following the  purchases, the unit  trusts declined\r\n\nsubstantially  in value,  but  their  market  value  was  not\r\n\nreported in any public listing.\r\n\n     In  June  1987,  Almonte moved  from  Kidder  to another\r\n\nbrokerage firm, Paine  Webber Inc.  On July  29, 1987, Kidder\r\n\nsent  Cooperativa an account summary indicating that the unit\r\n\ntrusts  had  lost  about ten  percent  of  their  value since\r\n\nCooperativa's  purchases.  Kidder's  letter said that  it was\r\n\nprepared \"to  analyze these  results in more  detail and  the\r\n\npresent  situation of your  portfolio.\"  Cooperativa  did not\r\n\nreply  but transferred its account to Paine Webber, following\r\n\nAlmonte to his new brokerage firm.\r\n\n     During    August    1987,    Cooperativa's    investment\r\n\nadministrator did call Almonte to ask why the unit trusts had\r\n\nlost value.    Almonte allegedly  replied that  such ups  and\r\n\ndowns  were normal,  that the  securities  would soon  regain\r\n\nstrength  and  that  Cooperativa  would  continue  to receive\r\n\ninterest payments regardless of market value.  The underlying\r\n\nbonds continued to decline in value until July 1989, when the\r\n\ntrusts were liquidated  by the trustee.   Cooperativa alleges\r\n\nthat it suffered a  loss of about $780,000 in principal  as a\r\n\nresult of the purchases.\r\n\n     On December 28,  1989, just over  three years after  its\r\n\nlast  purchase of  the  securities in  question,  Cooperativa\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nfiled a suit against Almonte,  Kidder, and Paine Webber.  The\r\n\nonly claims remaining  in this case are  claims under section\r\n\n10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C.  \r\n\n78j(b)   (1997).    The   defendants  pled  the   statute  of\r\n\nlimitations and extensive litigation ensued addressed to that\r\n\nsubject.  \r\n\n     When the  complaint was  filed in  1989, federal  courts\r\n\napplied  the local  statute of  limitations  to claims  under\r\n\nsection 10(b),  but thereafter  the Supreme  Court adopted  a\r\n\none-and-three-year  limitations   period  for   such  claims.\r\n\nLampf, Pleva, Lipkind,  Prupis &amp; Petigrow v.  Gilbertson, 501\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  350,  364  (1991).    The  district  court  then  found\r\n\nCooperativa's claims barred under this new rule and dismissed\r\n\nthem.  See Cooperativa de  Ahorro y Credito Aguada v. Kidder,\r                                                                         \r\n\nPeabody &amp; Co., 777 F. Supp. 153, 156 (D.P.R. 1991).  Congress\r                         \r\n\nthen  passed a new  statute providing that  local statutes of\r\n\nlimitations  should continue to  govern suits filed  prior to\r                                                                      \r\n\nthe  Supreme Court  decision,  and allowing  reinstatement of\r\n\nclaims  that had already been dismissed under the new Supreme\r\n\nCourt rule.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1See Federal  Deposit Insurance  Corporation Improvement\r                     \r\nAct of 1991, Pub.

The\r                                                                  \r\nAct  was  recently  held   unconstitutional  insofar  as   it\r\npurported   to  reopen  prior   final  judgments,   Plaut  v.\r                                                                     \r\nSpendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211 (1995).\r                                  \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     Cooperativa then  moved to  reinstate its  section 10(b)\r\n\nclaims, but  the district court  held that even if  local law\r\n\nwere applied  the claims  would be  time-barred under  Puerto\r\n\nRico's two-year  statute of limitations  for blue-sky claims.\r\n\n799 F.  Supp. 261,  263 (D.P.R. 1992)  (citing 10  L.P.R.A.  \r\n\n890(e)).   On appeal,  we remanded for  further consideration\r\n\nbecause the district court had relied on evidence outside the\r\n\npleadings in  dismissing the claim.   993 F.2d 269  (1st Cir.\r\n\n1993), cert.  denied, 514 U.S.  1082 (1995).  On  remand, the\r                                \r\n\ndistrict  court  reached  the  same  conclusion   on  summary\r\n\njudgment, 942 F. Supp. 735 (D.P.R. 1996), and we now affirm.2\r\n\n     In  securities cases,  federal case law  permits tolling\r\n\nfor fraudulent concealment  even where state law  does not do\r\n\nso.  The statute does not  begin to run until \"the time  when\r\n\nplaintiff in the exercise  of reasonable diligence discovered\r\n\nor should have discovered the  fraud of which he  complains.\"\r\n\nCook v. Avien,  Inc., 573 F.2d 685, 694 (1st Cir. 1978).  But\r                                \r\n\n\"`storm  warnings'  of  the possibility  of  fraud  trigger a\r\n\nplaintiff's  duty  to investigate  in  a reasonably  diligent\r\n\nmanner .  . . and his cause of  action is deemed to accrue on\r\n\nthe date  when he should have discovered  the alleged fraud.\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Because we agree that the case  should be dismissed, we\r\nneed  not reach  the question  whether  the reinstatement  of\r\nCooperativa's  dismissed  claim  was  unconstitutional  under\r\nPlaut, an issue  neither side has briefed.

In reviewing  this assessment, we  take\r\n\nall reasonably disputed facts in the light  most favorable to\r\n\nCooperativa.   See J.  Geils Band  Employee  Benefit Plan  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSmith Barney Shearson, Inc.,  76 F.3d 1245, 1250  (1st Cir.),\r                                       \r\n\ncert. denied, 117  S. Ct. 81 (1996).   And we review  de novo\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe district  court's decision  that the  record, so  viewed,\r\n\nnevertheless  compelled  a  determination  in  favor  of  the\r\n\ndefendants.  See Maggio, 824 F.2d at 128.\r                                   \r\n\n     The securities acquired by Cooperativa were generating a\r\n\nvery  generous interest rate--over 12  percent at a time when\r\n\nCooperativa  was paying its  own depositors six  percent; the\r\n\nconfirmation  slips and  the title  of  the units  themselves\r\n\nreflected  this facet  of the  investment,  using the  phrase\r\n\n\"high yield.\"  Yet Cooperativa knew that within one year (and\r\n\nmuch less for some of the purchases), the market value of the\r\n\ninvestment had dropped  by about $340,000  or ten percent  of\r\n\nthe original investment.\r\n\n     The gravamen of Cooperativa's claim in this case is that\r\n\nit had  been assured by  Almonte in 1987 that  its investment\r\n\nwas  low-risk, safe  and  not  of  a  speculative  character.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nNotwithstanding that bond prices commonly fluctuate, the high\r\n\ninterest rates coupled with the drastic short-term decline in\r\n\nvalue ought to  have suggested to  a reasonable investor  the\r\n\npossibility  that Almonte  had  not accurately  described the\r                       \r\n\ninvestment.   The  possibility  of  fraud  is  buttressed  by\r\n\nAlmonte's failure to provide the promised prospectuses.\r\n\n     Cooperativa   says  that  it  did  ask  Almonte  for  an\r\n\nexplanation of the decline.  But even an investor of ordinary\r\n\njudgment and experience can  discern that there is  some risk\r\n\nin limiting inquiry to the very broker who may have misled or\r\n\neven defrauded  the investor.   In  this instance,  moreover,\r\n\nthere  is no indication  that Almonte provided  anything more\r\n\nthan  bland   generalities  about  market   fluctuations  and\r\n\nrepeated reassurances  that the  investment was  safe.   This\r\n\ndoes not seem  sufficient to dispel a reasonable suspicion of\r\n\nfraud.\r\n\n     Therefore,  in  August  1987,  Cooperativa  had   \"storm\r\n\nwarnings\" of fraud and, in the exercise of due diligence, was\r\n\nobliged  to do  something more  than sit  on its  hands.   It\r\n\nmight, for example, have pursued Kidder's offer to assess the\r\n\nsituation,  Almonte no longer being associated with the firm;\r\n\nor it might  have sought  an expert  opinion on  this set  of\r\n\ninvestments from a wholly independent party; or it might have\r\n\nmade  an  effort  through its  own  resources  to investigate\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                         -7-\r\r\n\npromptly the nature of the investment it made.  It took  none\r\n\nof these steps.3\r\n\n     As it happens, by the fall of 1987, adverse  information\r\n\nabout high-yield junk bonds from Drexel Burnham in particular\r\n\nwould not have been hard to uncover.  The extraordinary stock\r\n\nmarket  plunge  in  October 1987  focused  considerable press\r\n\nattention  on both junk  bonds and Drexel  Burnham, turning a\r\n\nsmall trickle of  earlier newspaper references into  a swell.\r\n\nIn any case,  an analyst  could quickly  have identified  the\r\n\ninaccuracy of Almonte's alleged description, based  merely on\r\n\nthe  relatively  poor  ratings of  the  bonds  underlying the\r\n\ntrusts.\r\n\n     We  need not decide  whether the statute  of limitations\r\n\nbegins  to run on  the date the storm  warnings appear or the\r\n\nlater  date  on  which an  inquiring  investor  would through\r\n\nreasonable  diligence  have discovered  the fraud.   Compare,\r                                                                         \r\n\ne.g.,  General Builders,  796  F.2d  at  13  (suggesting  the\r                                   \r\n\nformer),  with  Maggio,  824  F.2d  at  129  (suggesting  the\r                                  \r\n\nlatter).  The time between the two dates in most cases is not\r\n\nlikely to  be long enough  to affect the  outcome.  So  it is\r\n\nhere:  even  if the statute  did not begin  to run until  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     3Despite  Cooperativa's  claim   to  the  contrary,  the\r\nobligation  of diligent inquiry exists whether or not Almonte\r\nis labeled  a \"fiduciary.\"   See Salois  v.

The district court  thought that\r\n\nCooperativa's  responsibility to  investigate was  heightened\r\n\nbecause  of letters from its  own auditors, including ones in\r\n\n1985 and 1986, warning that its aggressive investment program\r\n\npresented  some  level  of risk  and  ought  to  be carefully\r\n\nscrutinized.   There is  force in  Cooperativa's answer  that\r\n\nthese boilerplate warnings  were not in any  way specifically\r\n\ndirected to the securities at issue in this case.\r\n\n     Conversely,  Cooperativa  is  mistaken  in  invoking  an\r\n\nopinion  letter  to it  dated  March  3, 1988,  from  another\r\n\nauditor.   The  opinion, apparently  commissioned by  Almonte\r\n\nhimself, deals  only with  how Cooperativa  might report  its\r\n\ninvestments  in  long-term obligations  and opines  that they\r\n\ncould still be carried at purchase price despite a decline in\r\n\nmarket value.   The  letter does  not comment at  all on  the\r\n\nsafety  or riskiness  of the  securities  here involved,  and\r\n\nobtaining the opinion does not represent due diligence.\r\n\n     In sum, Cooperativa was on notice by mid- or late summer\r\n\n1987  that Almonte's  alleged description  of the  securities\r\n\nmight well  have  been  inaccurate  or even  dishonest.    By\r\n\ndiligent  inquiry, it  could quickly  have  learned that  the\r\n\nalleged  statements  were   false.    Thus  the   statute  of\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                         -9-\r\r\n\nlimitations began to run no later than the fall of the  1987.\r\n\nIts suit, brought  in December 1989, was  therefore barred by\r\n\nPuerto Rico's two-year statute of limitations.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -10-\r                                         -10-\r\r\n",

Cooperativa is a small, one-branch savings and loan \"cooperative\" located in Aguada, Puerto Rico.  Between June and December 1986, Cooperativa purchased $3.5 million in Drexel Burnham Lambert \"unit trusts,\" securities representing participations in several trusts whose assets were corporate bonds.  The securities were purchased at the recommendation of Ramon Almonte, Cooperativa's broker at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  (\"Kidder\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Cooperativa, Almonte told it that the securities were a low-risk, safe and unspeculative investment, that the securities were not redeemable for another seven to ten years and that a steady stream of income at favorable interest rates could be expected.  The securities were in fact backed by low-rated or unrated \"junk\" bonds bearing high interest rates;  and if the value of the bonds fell drastically, the trustees had power to terminate the trusts.  Allegedly, Almonte disclosed neither the risky character of the bonds nor the termination provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of its 1986 purchases of the securities in question, Cooperativa received confirmation slips that stated that prospectuses were being forwarded under separate cover.  No prospectus covering these securities ever arrived and Cooperativa did not request copies.  Cooperativa's officers were admittedly unsophisticated in financial matters.  Over the year following the purchases, the unit trusts declined substantially in value, but their market value was not reported in any public listing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1987, Almonte moved from Kidder to another brokerage firm, Paine Webber Inc. On July 29, 1987, Kidder sent Cooperativa an account summary indicating that the unit trusts had lost about ten percent of their value since Cooperativa's purchases.  Kidder's letter said that it was prepared \"to analyze these results in more detail and the present situation of your portfolio.\"   Cooperativa did not reply but transferred its account to Paine Webber, following Almonte to his new brokerage firm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During August 1987, Cooperativa's investment administrator did call Almonte to ask why the unit trusts had lost value.  Almonte allegedly replied that such ups and downs were normal, that the securities would soon regain strength and that Cooperativa would continue to receive interest payments regardless of market value.  The underlying bonds continued to decline in value until July 1989, when the trusts were liquidated by the trustee.  Cooperativa alleges that it suffered a loss of about $780,000 in principal as a result of the purchases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 28, 1989, just over three years after its last purchase of the securities in question, Cooperativa filed a suit against Almonte, Kidder, and Paine Webber.  The only claims remaining in this case are claims under section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b) (1997).  The defendants pled the statute of limitations and extensive litigation ensued addressed to that subject.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the complaint was filed in 1989, federal courts applied the local statute of limitations to claims under section 10(b), but thereafter the Supreme Court adopted a one-and-three-year limitations period for such claims.  Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U.S. 350, 364, 111 S.Ct. 2773, 2782, 115 L.Ed.2d 321 (1991).  The district court then found Cooperativa's claims barred under this new rule and dismissed them.  See Cooperativa de Ahorro y Credito Aguada v. Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., 777 F.Supp. 153, 156 (D.P.R.1991).  Congress then passed a new statute providing that local statutes of limitations should continue to govern suits filed prior to the Supreme Court decision, and allowing reinstatement of claims that had already been dismissed under the new Supreme Court rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cooperativa then moved to reinstate its section 10(b) claims, but the district court held that even if local law were applied the claims would be time-barred under Puerto Rico's two-year statute of limitations for blue-sky claims.  799 F.Supp. 261, 263 (D.P.R.1992) (citing 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 890(e)).  On appeal, we remanded for further consideration because the district court had relied on evidence outside the pleadings in dismissing the claim.  993 F.2d 269 (1st Cir.1993), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1082, 115 S.Ct. 1792, 131 L.Ed.2d 720 (1995).  On remand, the district court reached the same conclusion on summary judgment, 942 F.Supp. 735 (D.P.R.1996), and we now affirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In securities cases, federal case law permits tolling for fraudulent concealment even where state law does not do so.  The statute does not begin to run until \"the time when plaintiff in the exercise of reasonable diligence discovered or should have discovered the fraud of which he complains.\"  Cook v. Avien, Inc., 573 F.2d 685, 694 (1st Cir.1978).  But \" 'storm warnings' of the possibility of fraud trigger a plaintiff's duty to investigate in a reasonably diligent manner ... and his cause of action is deemed to accrue on the date when he should have discovered the alleged fraud.\"  Maggio v. Gerard Freezer &amp; Ice Co., 824 F.2d 123, 128 (1st Cir.1987) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that, by mid-August 1987, Cooperativa had reasonable notice of the possibility of fraud by Almonte and did not thereafter exercise due diligence in pursuing the issue.  In reviewing this assessment, we take all reasonably disputed facts in the light most favorable to Cooperativa.  See J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76 F.3d 1245, 1250 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 81, 136 L.Ed.2d 39 (1996).  And we review de novo the district court's decision that the record, so viewed, nevertheless compelled a determination in favor of the defendants.  See Maggio, 824 F.2d at 128.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The securities acquired by Cooperativa were generating a very generous interest rate--over 12 percent at a time when Cooperativa was paying its own depositors six percent;  the confirmation slips and the title of the units themselves reflected this facet of the investment, using the phrase \"high yield.\"   Yet Cooperativa knew that within one year (and much less for some of the purchases), the market value of the investment had dropped by about $340,000 or ten percent of the original investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gravamen of Cooperativa's claim in this case is that it had been assured by Almonte in 1987 that its investment was low-risk, safe and not of a speculative character.  Notwithstanding that bond prices commonly fluctuate, the high interest rates coupled with the drastic short-term decline in value ought to have suggested to a reasonable investor the possibility that Almonte had not accurately described the investment.  The possibility of fraud is buttressed by Almonte's failure to provide the promised prospectuses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cooperativa says that it did ask Almonte for an explanation of the decline.  But even an investor of ordinary judgment and experience can discern that there is some risk in limiting inquiry to the very broker who may have misled or even defrauded the investor.  In this instance, moreover, there is no indication that Almonte provided anything more than bland generalities about market fluctuations and repeated reassurances that the investment was safe.  This does not seem sufficient to dispel a reasonable suspicion of fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, in August 1987, Cooperativa had \"storm warnings\" of fraud and, in the exercise of due diligence, was obliged to do something more than sit on its hands.  It might, for example, have pursued Kidder's offer to assess the situation, Almonte no longer being associated with the firm;  or it might have sought an expert opinion on this set of investments from a wholly independent party;  or it might have made an effort through its own resources to investigate promptly the nature of the investment it made.  It took none of these steps.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, by the fall of 1987, adverse information about high-yield junk bonds from Drexel Burnham in particular would not have been hard to uncover.  The extraordinary stock market plunge in October 1987 focused considerable press attention on both junk bonds and Drexel Burnham, turning a small trickle of earlier newspaper references into a swell.  In any case, an analyst could quickly have identified the inaccuracy of Almonte's alleged description, based merely on the relatively poor ratings of the bonds underlying the trusts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether the statute of limitations begins to run on the date the storm warnings appear or the later date on which an inquiring investor would through reasonable diligence have discovered the fraud.  Compare, e.g., General Builders, 796 F.2d at 13 (suggesting the former), with Maggio, 824 F.2d at 129 (suggesting the latter).  The time between the two dates in most cases is not likely to be long enough to affect the outcome.  So it is here:  even if the statute did not begin to run until the fall of 1987, more than two years elapsed between that point and late December 1989 when the suit was finally brought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching our conclusion, we give little weight to two other pieces of evidence.  The district court thought that Cooperativa's responsibility to investigate was heightened because of letters from its own auditors, including ones in 1985 and 1987, warning that its aggressive investment program presented some level of risk and ought to be carefully scrutinized.  There is force in Cooperativa's answer that these boilerplate warnings were not in any way specifically directed to the securities at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, Cooperativa is mistaken in invoking an opinion letter to it dated March 3, 1988, from another auditor.  The opinion, apparently commissioned by Almonte himself, deals only with how Cooperativa might report its investments in long-term obligations and opines that they could still be carried at purchase price despite a decline in market value.  The letter does not comment at all on the safety or riskiness of the securities here involved, and obtaining the opinion does not represent due diligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Cooperativa was on notice by mid or late summer 1987 that Almonte's alleged description of the securities might well have been inaccurate or even dishonest.  By diligent inquiry, it could quickly have learned that the alleged statements were false.  Thus the statute of limitations began to run no later than the fall of the 1987.  Its suit, brought in December 1989, was therefore barred by Puerto Rico's two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, Pub.L.

Cooperativa is a small, one-branch savings and loan \"cooperative\" located in Aguada, Puerto Rico.  Between June and December 1986, Cooperativa purchased $3.5 million in Drexel Burnham Lambert \"unit trusts,\" securities representing participations in several trusts whose assets were corporate bonds.  The securities were purchased at the recommendation of Ramon Almonte, Cooperativa's broker at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  (\"Kidder\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Cooperativa, Almonte told it that the securities were a low-risk, safe and unspeculative investment, that the securities were not redeemable for another seven to ten years and that a steady stream of income at favorable interest rates could be expected.  The securities were in fact backed by low-rated or unrated \"junk\" bonds bearing high interest rates;  and if the value of the bonds fell drastically, the trustees had power to terminate the trusts.  Allegedly, Almonte disclosed neither the risky character of the bonds nor the termination provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of its 1986 purchases of the securities in question, Cooperativa received confirmation slips that stated that prospectuses were being forwarded under separate cover.  No prospectus covering these securities ever arrived and Cooperativa did not request copies.  Cooperativa's officers were admittedly unsophisticated in financial matters.  Over the year following the purchases, the unit trusts declined substantially in value, but their market value was not reported in any public listing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1987, Almonte moved from Kidder to another brokerage firm, Paine Webber Inc. On July 29, 1987, Kidder sent Cooperativa an account summary indicating that the unit trusts had lost about ten percent of their value since Cooperativa's purchases.  Kidder's letter said that it was prepared \"to analyze these results in more detail and the present situation of your portfolio.\"   Cooperativa did not reply but transferred its account to Paine Webber, following Almonte to his new brokerage firm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During August 1987, Cooperativa's investment administrator did call Almonte to ask why the unit trusts had lost value.  Almonte allegedly replied that such ups and downs were normal, that the securities would soon regain strength and that Cooperativa would continue to receive interest payments regardless of market value.  The underlying bonds continued to decline in value until July 1989, when the trusts were liquidated by the trustee.  Cooperativa alleges that it suffered a loss of about $780,000 in principal as a result of the purchases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 28, 1989, just over three years after its last purchase of the securities in question, Cooperativa filed a suit against Almonte, Kidder, and Paine Webber.  The only claims remaining in this case are claims under section 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78j(b) (1997).  The defendants pled the statute of limitations and extensive litigation ensued addressed to that subject.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the complaint was filed in 1989, federal courts applied the local statute of limitations to claims under section 10(b), but thereafter the Supreme Court adopted a one-and-three-year limitations period for such claims.

In reviewing this assessment, we take all reasonably disputed facts in the light most favorable to Cooperativa.  See J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196588\"><a href=\"/opinion/196588/j-geils-band-v-smith-barney/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span>, 1250 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></span> (1996).  And we review de novo the district court's decision that the record, so viewed, nevertheless compelled a determination in favor of the defendants.  See Maggio, 824 F.2d at 128.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The securities acquired by Cooperativa were generating a very generous interest rate--over 12 percent at a time when Cooperativa was paying its own depositors six percent;  the confirmation slips and the title of the units themselves reflected this facet of the investment, using the phrase \"high yield.\"   Yet Cooperativa knew that within one year (and much less for some of the purchases), the market value of the investment had dropped by about $340,000 or ten percent of the original investment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The gravamen of Cooperativa's claim in this case is that it had been assured by Almonte in 1987 that its investment was low-risk, safe and not of a speculative character.  Notwithstanding that bond prices commonly fluctuate, the high interest rates coupled with the drastic short-term decline in value ought to have suggested to a reasonable investor the possibility that Almonte had not accurately described the investment.  The possibility of fraud is buttressed by Almonte's failure to provide the promised prospectuses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cooperativa says that it did ask Almonte for an explanation of the decline.  But even an investor of ordinary judgment and experience can discern that there is some risk in limiting inquiry to the very broker who may have misled or even defrauded the investor.  In this instance, moreover, there is no indication that Almonte provided anything more than bland generalities about market fluctuations and repeated reassurances that the investment was safe.  This does not seem sufficient to dispel a reasonable suspicion of fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, in August 1987, Cooperativa had \"storm warnings\" of fraud and, in the exercise of due diligence, was obliged to do something more than sit on its hands.  It might, for example, have pursued Kidder's offer to assess the situation, Almonte no longer being associated with the firm;  or it might have sought an expert opinion on this set of investments from a wholly independent party;  or it might have made an effort through its own resources to investigate promptly the nature of the investment it made.  It took none of these steps.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As it happens, by the fall of 1987, adverse information about high-yield junk bonds from Drexel Burnham in particular would not have been hard to uncover.  The extraordinary stock market plunge in October 1987 focused considerable press attention on both junk bonds and Drexel Burnham, turning a small trickle of earlier newspaper references into a swell.  In any case, an analyst could quickly have identified the inaccuracy of Almonte's alleged description, based merely on the relatively poor ratings of the bonds underlying the trusts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether the statute of limitations begins to run on the date the storm warnings appear or the later date on which an inquiring investor would through reasonable diligence have discovered the fraud.  Compare, e.g., General Builders, 796 F.2d at 13 (suggesting the former), with Maggio, 824 F.2d at 129 (suggesting the latter).  The time between the two dates in most cases is not likely to be long enough to affect the outcome.  So it is here:  even if the statute did not begin to run until the fall of 1987, more than two years elapsed between that point and late December 1989 when the suit was finally brought.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaching our conclusion, we give little weight to two other pieces of evidence.  The district court thought that Cooperativa's responsibility to investigate was heightened because of letters from its own auditors, including ones in 1985 and 1987, warning that its aggressive investment program presented some level of risk and ought to be carefully scrutinized.  There is force in Cooperativa's answer that these boilerplate warnings were not in any way specifically directed to the securities at issue in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conversely, Cooperativa is mistaken in invoking an opinion letter to it dated March 3, 1988, from another auditor.  The opinion, apparently commissioned by Almonte himself, deals only with how Cooperativa might report its investments in long-term obligations and opines that they could still be carried at purchase price despite a decline in market value.  The letter does not comment at all on the safety or riskiness of the securities here involved, and obtaining the opinion does not represent due diligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Cooperativa was on notice by mid or late summer 1987 that Almonte's alleged description of the securities might well have been inaccurate or even dishonest.  By diligent inquiry, it could quickly have learned that the alleged statements were false.  Thus the statute of limitations began to run no later than the fall of the 1987.  Its suit, brought in December 1989, was therefore barred by Puerto Rico's two-year statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> See Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, Pub.L.
