Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Luis Angel Parrilla-Sanes on brief pro se.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, and Thomas F.\nKlumper, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\f                              April 9, 2001\n\n\n\n           Per Curiam. Defendant Luis Angel Parrilla-Sanes,\n\nhaving    been    convicted     by    a    jury   of     two    drug-related\n\noffenses, and having opted to proceed pro se on appeal in\n\nresponse to his counsel's submission of an Anders brief,\n\nadvances various challenges to his sentence.                    His primary\n\ncontention is that the district court failed to anticipate\n\nthe rule announced in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000).    Defendant is correct that an                 Apprendi violation\n\noccurred here, but his victory is a Pyrrhic one; we review\n\nthat   claim     only   for   plain       error   and    find    none.     As\n\ndefendant's remaining contentions also prove unavailing, we\n\nwill   thus    affirm   the    judgment--after          first    pausing   to\n\ncorrect a clerical error therein.\n\n           Defendant, a former police officer, participated\n\nin a scheme to transport 109 kilograms of cocaine from\n\nColombia to Puerto Rico.        The drug shipment ended up making\n\nit only part way--to the island of Dominica in the West\n\nIndies--before the plot was foiled.               Defendant was indicted\n\nand convicted on two charges: conspiracy to possess with\n\nintent to distribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) & 846,\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f and conspiracy to import same into the United States, id. §§\n\n 952(a)(1) & 963.          The district court, after making two\n\n adjustments to the offense level and rejecting two others,\n\n imposed concurrent prison terms of 292 months along with\n\n five years of supervised release.\n\n            The Apprendi rule provides that any fact (other\n\n than a prior conviction) that increases the maximum penalty\n\n for a crime is an element of the offense, and accordingly\n\n must be (1) set forth in the indictment, (2) submitted to a\n\n jury,   and    (3)    proven   beyond      a   reasonable   doubt.     The\n\n district      judge    here,   applying        then-prevailing   circuit\n\n precedent, withheld the issue of drug quantity from the jury\n\n and instead determined it at sentencing.               Had defendant's\n\n sentence   not    exceeded     the   20-year     default    maximum   that\n\n applies under 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C) regardless of drug\n\n quantity, Apprendi would not have been implicated.                    See,\n\n e.g., United States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 119-20 (1 st\n\n Cir. 2001); United States v. Houle, 237 F.3d 71, 78-81 (1st\n\n Cir. 2001).          Yet because his 292-month sentence was in\n\n excess thereof, the government correctly concedes that the\n\n question of drug quantity should have gone to the jury.1\n\n\n    1   It is doubtful, however, that the indictment itself\ncontravened the Apprendi rule.  It specifically charged that\nmore than five kilograms of cocaine were involved--an amount\n\n                                      -3-\n\f               Nonetheless,      we        review    only     for    plain       error\n\n inasmuch as no such objection was voiced below.                          See, e.g.,\n\n United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 40 (1st Cir. 2001).                          To\n\n prevail under that standard, defendant must establish not\n\n only that a clear error occurred but that it affected his\n\n \"substantial rights,\" which usually requires a showing that\n\n the error was \"prejudicial.\"                   United States v. Olano, 507\n\n U.S. 725, 734 (1993).           Even then, an appellate court will\n\n grant relief only if the error \"seriously affect[s] the\n\n fairness,       integrity      or    public        reputation       of     judicial\n\n proceedings.\"           Id.    at    736        (internal    quotation          marks\n\n omitted); accord, e.g., Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S.\n\n 461,    467    (1997).        Petitioner         falls   well      short    of    the\n\n requisite      showing--for         the    simple    reason     that      the    drug\n\n amount,       which   was     established          through    the    uncontested\n\n testimony of a forensic scientist, was never thereafter\n\n placed in dispute.            The Court in          Johnson found no plain\n\n error    where    the    element          in    question     was    \"essentially\n\n\nsufficient to trigger the enhanced penalties in 21 U.S.C. §§\n841(b)(1)(A) & 960(b)(1). We need not resolve this question,\nsince an unpreserved challenge to a defective indictment in this\ncontext is subject to plain-error review (just like the other\ntwo prongs of Apprendi). See, e.g., United States v. Terry, 240\nF.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Mojica-Baez, 229\nF.3d 292, 307-12 (1st Cir. 2000), petition for cert. filed, No.\n00-8464 (Jan. 30, 2001). Contra United States v. Tran, 234 F.3d\n798, 809-10 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\n                                           -4-\n\f uncontroverted at trial,\" id. at 470; here, the quantity of\n\n drugs    was   entirely       uncontroverted.              Under    analogous\n\n circumstances, this court and others have readily concluded\n\n that plain error was lacking.               See, e.g., United States v.\n\n Terry,   240   F.3d    65,    74-75    (1st    Cir.   2001)    (alternative\n\n holding); United States v. Keeling, 235 F.3d 533, 539-40\n\n (10th Cir. 2000); United States v. Swatzie, 228 F.3d 1278,\n\n 1283 (11th Cir. 2000).           Compare, e.g.,            United States v.\n\n Nordby, 225 F.3d 1053, 1061 (9th Cir. 2000).                       Defendant's\n\n Apprendi-based claims thus entitle him to no relief.2\n\n            Defendant's remaining challenges, which pertain to\n\n the sentencing adjustments, require little discussion.                      He\n\n first assigns error to the court's finding that he did not\n\n warrant a two-level decrease under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b) as a\n\n minor participant.          Yet the evidence showed that defendant\n\n was \"a player rather than ... a dabbler,\" United States v.\n\n Ortiz-Santiago,       211    F.3d   146,      149   (1st    Cir.   2000)--for\n\n\n\n    2   No need arises to address the government's alternative\ncontention: that plain error is lacking because two 20-year\nsentences could have been imposed and made to run consecutively\nto the extent necessary to achieve the 292-month sentence\nprescribed by the Guidelines.    While some other courts have\nendorsed such reasoning (at least in the plain-error context),\nsee, e.g., United States v. Page, 232 F.3d 536, 544-45 (6th Cir.\n2000), cert. denied, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2001 WL 121935; compare\nUnited States v. Jones, 235 F.3d 1231, 1237-38 (10th Cir. 2000),\nwe express no views thereon.\n\n                                       -5-\n\fexample, that he was involved in various planning sessions\n\nand helped to recruit a pilot.               There was no clear error.\n\n          Second,      defendant          objects      to    a    two-level\n\nenhancement imposed under § 2D1.1(b)(1) for possession of a\n\ndangerous weapon.          While conceding that he knew of the\n\npresence of firearms, he protests that he was never in\n\npossession thereof and that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nwarrant   conviction       under   18   U.S.C.    §    924(c).     Yet    the\n\nenhancement \"requires only that it have been reasonably\n\nforeseeable that an accomplice would possess a gun.\"                  United\n\nStates v. De Leon Ruiz, 47 F.3d 452, 454 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nAnd   \"section    924(c)'s    'use      or    carry'   language    and   the\n\nrestrictive gloss from Bailey [v. United States, 516 U.S.\n\n137 (1995)] are not used in the guideline.\"                  United States\n\nv. Aker, 181 F.3d 167, 172 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Finally,     defendant          complains     of   a    two-level\n\nadjustment under § 3C1.1 for obstruction of justice--an\n\nenhancement      arising    from     his     attempt    to   tamper      with\n\npotential witnesses.        The same allegations resulted in the\n\npretrial revocation of his bail.             While the record before us\n\nomits some of the particulars, we find it sufficient to\n\nuphold the enhancement.            For example, defendant does not\n\ndeny making the comments in question to the pilot Maldonado;\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fhe simply points out that it was Maldonado who initiated the\n\nconversation--a contention that, even if true, has little\n\nrelevance.      Defendant       does    not   dispute     that     attempted\n\nsubordination of perjury warrants an obstruction-of-justice\n\nenhancement.        See, e.g., Aker, 181 F.3d at 172.\n\n            As a postscript, we take note of a clerical error\n\non   page    four    of   the   written    judgment.         The    judgment\n\nincorrectly reports that the district court adopted the\n\nguideline calculations in the pre-sentence report (PSR); in\n\nfact, the court diverged therefrom.                More particularly, in\n\nlisting the sentencing enhancements that ended up being\n\nimposed, the judgment incorrectly mentions an abuse-of-\n\nposition-of-trust enhancement (which the PSR had recommended\n\nbut the court rejected) while making no reference to the\n\ngun-possession enhancement.             This was obviously a clerical\n\noversight.     Cf. United States v. Muniz, 49 F.3d 36, 42 n.5\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (noting that court's oral expression of\n\nsentencing rationale is normally honored over divergent\n\nwritten     explanation).        Even    though     the   miscue    made   no\n\ndifference     below--the       total    offense    level,    the    ensuing\n\nrange, and the actual sentence were all accurately reported-\n\n-it conceivably could have collateral consequences.                        We\n\ntherefore direct the Clerk of the district court to amend\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fthe judgment accordingly.   See, e.g., Ansin v. River Oaks\n\nFurniture, Inc., 105 F.3d 745, 761 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n         As amended, the judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -8-\n\f",

The Court in          Johnson found no plain\n\n error    where    the    element          in    question     was    \"essentially\n\n\nsufficient to trigger the enhanced penalties in 21 U.S.C. §§\n841(b)(1)(A) & 960(b)(1).

While conceding that he knew of the\n\npresence of firearms, he protests that he was never in\n\npossession thereof and that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nwarrant   conviction       under   18   U.S.C.    §    924(c).     Yet    the\n\nenhancement \"requires only that it have been reasonably\n\nforeseeable that an accomplice would possess a gun.\"                  United\n\nStates v.

The same allegations resulted in the\n\npretrial revocation of his bail.             While the record before us\n\nomits some of the particulars, we find it sufficient to\n\nuphold the enhancement.            For example, defendant does not\n\ndeny making the comments in question to the pilot Maldonado;\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fhe simply points out that it was Maldonado who initiated the\n\nconversation--a contention that, even if true, has little\n\nrelevance.      Defendant       does    not   dispute     that     attempted\n\nsubordination of perjury warrants an obstruction-of-justice\n\nenhancement.        See, e.g., Aker, 181 F.3d at 172.\n\n            As a postscript, we take note of a clerical error\n\non   page    four    of   the   written    judgment.         The    judgment\n\nincorrectly reports that the district court adopted the\n\nguideline calculations in the pre-sentence report (PSR); in\n\nfact, the court diverged therefrom.                More particularly, in\n\nlisting the sentencing enhancements that ended up being\n\nimposed, the judgment incorrectly mentions an abuse-of-\n\nposition-of-trust enhancement (which the PSR had recommended\n\nbut the court rejected) while making no reference to the\n\ngun-possession enhancement.             This was obviously a clerical\n\noversight.     Cf. United States v. Muniz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195951\"><a href=\"/opinion/195951/united-states-v-muniz/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 42 n.5\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (noting that court's oral expression of\n\nsentencing rationale is normally honored over divergent\n\nwritten     explanation).        Even    though     the   miscue    made   no\n\ndifference     below--the       total    offense    level,    the    ensuing\n\nrange, and the actual sentence were all accurately reported-\n\n-it conceivably could have collateral consequences.                        We\n\ntherefore direct the Clerk of the district court to amend\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fthe judgment accordingly.   See, e.g., Ansin v.
