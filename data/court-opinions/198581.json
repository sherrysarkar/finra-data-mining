Robert W.

Nesselbush and Green, Greenberg &amp; Nesselbush on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\n   Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Michael P.\r\nIannotti, Assistant United States Attorney, and Sara Gardiner\r\nKilkenny, Assistant Regional Counsel, Social Security\r\nAdministration, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 27, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam. Claimant Naima Abdus-Sabur challenges a\r\ndecision of the Acting Commissioner of Social Security\r\n(\"Commissioner\") denying her applications for disability\r\ninsurance benefits and supplemental security income benefits. \r\nFor the following reasons, we think that a remand is required.\r\n          Claimant applied for benefits alleging that chronic\r\nfatigue syndrome (\"CFS\") and osteoarthritis disable her from\r\nworking.  After a hearing, an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\")\r\nconcluded that the evidence fails to establish a diagnosis of\r\nCFS.  The ALJ found that claimant suffers from mild arthritis,\r\narthralgias, myalgias, and possible CFS, and that her condition\r\nis severe.  However, the ALJ denied disability at step four of\r\nthe sequential analysis, concluding that claimant is capable of\r\nlight work activity and can perform her past relevant jobs as\r\na cleaner or as a receptionist.  \r\n          The Appeals Council denied review, thereby making the\r\ndecision of the ALJ the final decision of the Commissioner. \r\nClaimant then sought judicial review.  The parties consented to\r\nhave the case decided by a magistrate judge, see 28 U.S.C. \r\n636(c), who upheld the denial of benefits.  This appeal\r\nfollowed.     \r\n          Judicial review of the Commissioner's decision is\r\nauthorized by 42 U.S.C.  405(g) and  1383(c)(3).  \"Our review\r\nis limited to determining whether the ALJ deployed the proper\r\nlegal standards and found facts upon the proper quantum of\r\nevidence.\"  Nguyen v. Chater, 172 F.3d 31, 35 (1st Cir. 1999). \r\nThe ALJ's findings of fact are conclusive when supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence and reached through the correct legal\r\nstandards.  See id.; 42 U.S.C.  405(g), 1383(c)(3).\r\n          In the instant case, claimant testified that she\r\nsuffers from chronic sore throats, upper respiratory\r\ninfections, low grade fevers, swollen glands, pain all over her\r\nbody, severe fatigue, and disrupted sleep.  She testified that\r\nshe has difficulty sitting or standing for long periods of\r\ntime, that she cannot write because her fingers \"won't work,\"\r\nand that she drops things because she cannot grasp.  She also\r\ntestified that she has to lie down frequently, and that the\r\npain is sometimes so great that she stays in bed all day.\r\n          As for her activities, claimant testified that she\r\ncan drive, though, she said, \"it's difficult sometimes.\"  She\r\nstated that she manages grocery shopping with the help of her\r\ndaughter, and that she does some cleaning (though not the\r\n\"major parts\").  She also stated that she cooks, but that it's\r\nusually \"microwaveable stuff.\"  She attends worship services at\r\nher mosque, when she can.     \r\n          Claimant's own physicians--Dr. Gonsalves and Dr.\r\nClough--have diagnosed her as suffering from CFS and they have\r\nindicated that her physical capacities are quite limited.  The\r\nmost liberal assessment by Dr. Gonsalves is that claimant is\r\ncapable of sitting and standing in combination for no more than\r\nfour hours.  Dr. Clough indicated that claimant is capable of\r\nsitting and standing in combination for less than one hour. \r\nBoth Drs. Gonsalves and Clough have also indicated that\r\nclaimant has various non-exertional limitations including,\r\ninter alia, an inability to use her hands for repetitive\r\nmotion.\r\n          Claimant was also examined by two physicians in\r\nconnection with her applications for benefits.  Dr. Pharmakidis\r\nexamined claimant on June 3, 1993.  He wrote that, given her\r\nhistory and \"unremarkable\" physical examination, he would \"have\r\na great deal of difficulty to make a statement\" that she has\r\nCFS.  Dr. Robin conducted a mental examination on September 1,\r\n1993.  He diagnosed claimant as suffering from major depression\r\nbut indicated the need to rule out CFS.  \r\n          In addition, Dr. Pella, a non-examining physician,\r\nreviewed the medical record and testified at the hearing.  Dr.\r\nPella addressed whether claimant meets the criteria established\r\nby the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") for\r\nCFS.  He opined that \"the diagnosis [of CFS] is not established\r\nfrom the record as yet.\"  Among other things, Dr. Pella stated\r\nthat there is little in the way of physical findings in the\r\nrecord.  When asked to explain what physical findings he was\r\nreferring to, Dr. Pella stated that the \"soft ones\" are\r\n\"pharyngitis [inflammation of the throat], lymphadenopathy\r\n[disease of the lymph nodes], and documented fever.\"\r\n          In reaching his conclusion that a diagnosis of CFS is \r\nnot substantiated, the ALJ relied heavily on \"Dr. Pella['s]\r\nstate[ment] that the claimant failed to meet the CDC criteria\r\nfor a diagnosis of [CFS].\"  In justifying his conclusion as to\r\nclaimant's residual functional capacity, the ALJ also relied,\r\nin part, on the testimony of Dr. Pella, whom, the ALJ stated,\r\n\"maintained that the claimant was capable of performing light\r\nwork activity.\"  The ALJ explained that he discredited\r\nclaimant's allegations as to the severity of her symptoms in\r\nlight of the fact that \"the record fails to clearly document\r\nthat claimant meets the CDC criteria for [CFS].\"  He also\r\nrelied on evidence in the record that claimant \"still manages\r\nto cook, clean, do laundry, go grocery shopping, attend\r\n[religious services], and teach a class at her [mosque] once a\r\nweek.\"  \r\n          As an initial matter, we note that the Social\r\nSecurity Administration has recently issued a ruling designed\r\nto \"restate\" and \"clarify\" the policies of the Administration\r\nfor evaluating CFS cases.  See SSR 99-2p, \"Titles II and XVI:\r\nEvaluating Cases Involving Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.\"  The\r\nruling issued after this appeal was submitted.  In a post-\r\nbriefing filing, claimant suggests without developed\r\nargumentation that the new ruling applies.  In a response, the\r\nCommissioner takes the contrary position.  We need not resolve\r\nthe issue because we have concluded that, under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances of this case, a remand would be required in any\r\nevent.  \r\n          The new ruling is helpful, however, insofar as it\r\nprovides a summary of the current CDC working case definition\r\nof CFS.  Of particular note, the current definition--which was\r\nrevised in late 1994--is entirely symptom based.  See SSR 99-\r\n2p.  By contrast, the earlier (1988) definition included\r\ncertain \"physical criteria,\" namely, low-grade fever, palpable\r\nor tender lymph nodes, and inflammation of the throat, in\r\naddition to a list of symptoms.  See Report to the Senate\r\nAppropriations Committee for the Departments of Labor, Health\r\nand Human Services, Education and Related Agencies on the\r\nSocial Security Administration's Activities Relating to Chronic\r\nFatigue Syndrome (March 1991), included as an attachment to Fay\r\nE. Fishman, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Social Security\r\nDisability, 42 West's Social Security Reporting Service 789,\r\n808-10. \r\n          Claimant suggests that Dr. Pella and Dr. Pharmakidis\r\nemployed out-moded CFS guidelines.  We agree that this is a\r\nserious possibility.  The CDC definition of CFS was revised\r\njust months before the hearing, so it would not be surprising\r\nif Dr. Pella were unaware of the changes.  In elaborating on\r\nwhat he thought is absent from the present record but needed in\r\norder to establish a diagnosis of CFS, Dr. Pella appears to\r\nrefer to the \"physical criteria\" included in the 1988\r\ndefinition but dropped from the 1994 revised definition.  It is\r\nsafe to assume that Dr. Pharmakidis did not employ the current\r\ndefinition since his opinion was rendered while the old\r\ndefinition was in effect.\r\n         The Commissioner, while not taking issue with the\r\npossibility that these doctors employed out-moded guidelines,\r\nnonetheless contends that it does not matter.  In particular,\r\nthe Commissioner suggests that, since the ALJ found that\r\nclaimant suffers from \"possible\" CFS and continued on to\r\nevaluate her residual functional capacity, the outcome would\r\nhave been the same.  The Commissioner further argues that there\r\nis substantial evidence to support the finding that claimant is\r\ncapable of light work, including evidence as to her activities. \r\n         Contrary to this suggestion, we do not think that we\r\ncan conclude that the ALJ would have reached the same ultimate\r\nconclusion.  In rejecting the physical capacity assessments of\r\nDrs. Clough and Gonsalves, as well as claimant's own statements\r\nabout the severity of her symptoms, the ALJ relied on his\r\nintermediate conclusion that the diagnosis of CFS is not\r\nsubstantiated.  Because CFS can be a very debilitating disease\r\nwith symptoms out of proportion with any objective evidence,\r\nsee Rose v. Shalala, 34 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1994), the ALJ's\r\nultimate conclusion might have been different if his\r\nintermediate conclusion had been different.  Indeed, a finding\r\nthat claimant has CFS might have had some impact on the ALJ's\r\nevaluation as to whether her level of activity indicates an\r\nability to work.  Cf. Reddick v. Chater, 157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th\r\nCir. 1998) (recognizing that a pattern of sporadic activities\r\npunctuated with a need for rest is fully consistent with CFS);\r\nCohen v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., 964 F.2d 524, 530-\r\n31 (6th Cir. 1992) (similar).\r\n         A final consideration is whether we can affirm on the\r\nbasis stated by the magistrate judge.  We think not even if we\r\nassume without deciding that claimant could otherwise be found\r\n\"not disabled\" based on a capacity for part-time work.  In\r\nreaching his conclusion, the magistrate judge relied on a\r\nphysical capacity assessment of Dr. Gonsalves which indicates\r\nthat claimant can sit and/or stand in combination for up to\r\nthree hours but also indicates that she has non-exertional\r\nlimitations.  There is no evidence in the record as to whether\r\nthe non-exertional limitations are compatible with claimant's\r\npast relevant work.  Nor is there any evidence as to whether\r\nother work is available for someone with these non-exertional\r\nlimitations.\r\n         In sum, in light of the uncertainty as to whether Dr.\r\nPella evaluated the medical record under the current CDC\r\nguidelines, and the certainty that Dr. Pharmakidis did not, we\r\nare unable to conclude that their opinions constitute\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the ALJ's decision.  Nor are we\r\nable to conclude with confidence that the ALJ's decision would\r\nhave been the same if these physicians had employed current\r\nguidelines and reached a different decision as to whether\r\nclaimant has CFS.  Accordingly, the judgment of the district\r\ncourt is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court\r\nwith instructions to remand to the Commissioner for further\r\nfindings and/or proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n         Vacated and remanded.\n",

Nor is there any evidence as to whether\r\nother work is available for someone with these non-exertional\r\nlimitations.\r\n         In sum, in light of the uncertainty as to whether Dr.\r\nPella evaluated the medical record under the current CDC\r\nguidelines, and the certainty that Dr. Pharmakidis did not, we\r\nare unable to conclude that their opinions constitute\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the ALJ's decision.  Nor are we\r\nable to conclude with confidence that the ALJ's decision would\r\nhave been the same if these physicians had employed current\r\nguidelines and reached a different decision as to whether\r\nclaimant has CFS.  Accordingly, the judgment of the district\r\ncourt is vacated and the case is remanded to the district court\r\nwith instructions to remand to the Commissioner for further\r\nfindings and/or proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\r\n         Vacated and remanded.\n</pre>",
