  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION-NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\nFor the First Circuit\r\n\n\nNo. 98-1077\r\n\nREX FORNARO,\r\nPlaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\nv.\r\n\nJAMES MCMANUS, ET AL.,\r\nDefendants, Appellees.\r\n\n\n\nAPPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n[Hon. Shane Devine, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n\nBefore\r\n\nTorruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\nStahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand Rosenn, Senior Circuit Judge.\r\n\n\nRobert E. Murphy, Jr., with whom Paul L. Apple and Wadleigh,\r\nStarr, Peters, Dunn &amp; Chiesa were on brief, for appellant.\r\nPeter Bennett, with whom Frederick B. Finberg and Bennett\r\nBennett and Troiano, P.A. were on brief, for appellees Pamela\r\nCantin and Gary E. Ellmer.\r\nDorit S. Heimer, with whom Levett, Rockwood &amp; Sanders was on\r\nbrief, for appellees George Lindemann, et al.\r\n\n\n\nJuly 10, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Appellant's motion to amend paragraph 10 of the\r\ncomplaint is granted.\r\nUpon full review of the record in this case, we do not agree\r\nwith the district court's finding that it lacked personal\r\njurisdiction over four of the parties.  This conclusion, however,\r\ndoes not alter the ultimate result of the case because we affirm\r\nthe district court's holding that the appellant failed to state a\r\nlegally cognizable claim and extend that holding to include those\r\nfour parties.  Lastly, we express no opinion as to the merits of\r\nthe district court's extension of the Burford abstention doctrine\r\nto non-state administrative proceedings, as it is unnecessary to\r\nsupport our decision.\r\nAppellees' Ellmer and Cantin motion for sanctions is grantedand is referred to the district court for a hearing and appropriate\r\naction.\r\nDouble costs are granted to appellees.\r\n",
