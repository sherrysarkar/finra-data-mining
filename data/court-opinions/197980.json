In this case, we must construe\r\nprovisions of a complex partnership agreement between two\r\nsophisticated parties to a real estate development deal.  We\r\nmust determine whether the partnership agreement entitles one\r\nof those parties, the 400 Wyman Street Trust (Wyman), through\r\nits trustees, to call on its partner, International Business\r\nMachines Corporation (IBM), to provide a multi-million dollar\r\ncapital contribution in this circumstance, involving the later\r\nrefinancing of the original permanent loan.  That refinancing\r\ninvolves the purchase of the original mortgage note, which\r\nprovided the initial financing for the project, the development\r\nof an office building in Waltham, Massachusetts.\r\n    In the district court, IBM moved for summary\r\njudgment, arguing that the agreement was unambiguous and\r\nimposed no such obligation on it.  Wyman opposed IBM's motion,\r\narguing that the agreement was ambiguous and that, under\r\nMassachusetts law, Wyman must therefore be permitted to submit\r\nparol evidence in the form of the testimony of its negotiating\r\nattorneys.  The district court determined that, quite apart\r\nfrom any parol evidence, the agreement was unambiguous in its\r\nimposition of such a capital contribution obligation on IBM,\r\nand entered summary judgment sua sponte for Wyman.  We agree\r\nthat the agreement unambiguously supports Wyman's position and\r\nthat resort to parol evidence is therefore unnecessary.  We\r\nalso find no error in the district court's decision to enter\r\nsummary judgment sua sponte for Wyman.  We affirm.\r\n                            I.\r\n                                    In October 1986, IBM and Wyman entered into a\r\npartnership to develop and operate an office building at 400\r\nWyman Street, Waltham, Massachusetts.  Wyman contributed a\r\nparcel of land, valued by the parties at $19.3 million,\r\nreceived a majority interest of 51% in the partnership and was\r\nnamed the managing partner.  For its part, IBM agreed to a\r\nlong-term lease commitment, and also contributed $1 million at\r\nthe outset of the agreement.  IBM received a minority interest\r\nof 49% in the partnership.  IBM also agreed to make additional\r\ncapital contributions, if such contributions were \"required for\r\nany purpose,\" so long as the two parties' \"adjusted capital\r\ncontributions\" remained out of balance; i.e., those\r\ncontributions did not reflect the 51:49 ratio of the parties'\r\nownership shares in the partnership.\r\n    The partnership planned to finance the project\r\nthrough a $75 million non-recourse mortgage note (the\r\n\"permanent loan\"), and obtained such a loan from Citicorp Real\r\nEstate, Inc., which subsequently sold it to a consortium of\r\nforeign banks for which Citicorp served as the agent.  The\r\npartnership had difficulty generating sufficient revenue to\r\nmake its loan payments.  In 1995, the partnership entered\r\nnegotiations with the lenders to refinance the permanent loan,\r\nwhich at that time had an outstanding principal balance of\r\napproximately $72 million.  The lenders did not agree to a\r\nrefinancing, but offered to sell the note outright for about\r\n$54 million.\r\n    Wyman believed the offer was a good solution to the\r\npartnership's problems, but IBM disagreed, regarding the price\r\nas too high.  To prevent the offer from expiring, Wyman caused\r\nits corporate affiliate, Wyman Loan Corp., to purchase the\r\nnote, and then proposed that the note be resold to the\r\npartnership at cost.  IBM opposed the plan.  Wyman sought\r\narbitration under the agreement, which requires that disputes\r\nconcerning a \"refinancing\" proposal be arbitrated.  IBM opposed\r\narbitration on the ground that Wyman had not yet proposed a\r\nrefinancing plan, but had only proposed that the partnership\r\npurchase the initial mortgage note, and that the issue was\r\ntherefore not yet arbitrable.\r\n    Wyman brought suit to compel arbitration under the\r\nagreement.  The district court, agreeing with Wyman that the\r\nissue was arbitrable, granted Wyman's motion to compel\r\narbitration.  See Bank v. International Bus. Mach. Corp. (Bank\r\nI), 915 F. Supp. 491, 498-99 (D. Mass. 1996).  This court\r\nreversed, holding that Wyman's motion to compel arbitration was\r\npremature because it had not submitted a concrete refinancing\r\nplan, but rather had proposed simply that the partnership\r\nacquire the initial mortgage note outright.  This court\r\nregarded Wyman's proposal at that time as a proposal to acquire\r\nan interest in real property, which is not arbitrable under the\r\nagreement, rather than a refinancing proposal, which is. \r\nSee Bank v. International Bus. Mach. Corp. (Bank II), 99 F.3d\r\n46, 49 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n    The parties could not agree to a more concrete\r\nrefinancing plan in part because they could not agree on the\r\nextent of IBM's obligation to provide additional capital\r\ncontributions.  Wyman thought the agreement provided it with\r\nthe ability to call on IBM to provide a capital contribution\r\nsufficient to bring the parties' \"adjusted capital\r\ncontributions\" into balance, which was approximately $17.5\r\nmillion, before it was obligated to seek third-party financing\r\nfor the partnership.  IBM did not dispute that it had some\r\nobligation under the agreement to provide additional capital,\r\nif such capital were required to complete the refinancing\r\nsuccessfully, but thought that it was only required to\r\ncontribute capital if sufficient funds could not be obtained at\r\ncommercially reasonable rates from third-party lenders.\r\n    Although the parties could not resolve this issue on\r\ntheir own, they agreed to a settlement which capped IBM's\r\npotential liability and posed one question for resolution by\r\nthe court.  The settlement agreement permitted IBM to exit the\r\npartnership upon a capital contribution of $6 million.  This\r\nwas done.  The agreement also provided that Wyman would bring\r\na declaratory judgment action to establish which partner's\r\ninterpretation of the agreement was correct.  Under the\r\nsettlement agreement, if Wyman won its suit, IBM would pay it\r\nan additional lump sum of $4 million.    If IBM won, it would be\r\nexcused from any further liability under the partnership\r\nagreement.\r\n    Wyman filed the contemplated declaratory judgment\r\naction.  Before any discovery had taken place, IBM moved for\r\nsummary judgment in its favor, arguing that the terms of the\r\ncontract were unambiguous and did not require it to make the\r\n$17.5 million capital contribution.  Wyman opposed IBM's motion\r\nfor summary judgment on the ground that the contract did impose\r\nsuch an obligation and that summary judgment was inappropriate\r\nat this stage because it wished to present parol evidence that\r\nit contended would clarify potential ambiguities in the\r\ncontract.  See Den Norske Bank AS v. First Nat'l Bank of\r\nBoston, 75 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1996) (under Massachusetts\r\nlaw, \"extrinsic evidence is admissible to assist the factfinder\r\nin ascertaining the intent of the parties as imperfectly\r\nexpressed in ambiguous contract language\").  Wyman attached\r\naffidavits to its opposition to summary judgment from the\r\nattorneys who had represented it during the partnership\r\nnegotiations.  Because we do not consider this evidence, we do\r\nnot describe the contents of the affidavits.\r\n    The district court decided against IBM's motion for\r\nsummary judgment.  It construed the contract's language as\r\nunambiguously supporting Wyman's position.  The district court\r\ndid not detect any ambiguity in the terms of the contract\r\nrequiring resort to parol evidence, as Wyman had argued. \r\nAlthough Wyman had not moved for summary judgment, the district\r\ncourt granted summary judgment sua sponte for Wyman, reasoning\r\nthat IBM's own motion for summary judgment had given it a fair\r\nopportunity to put forward its own interpretation of the\r\ncontract's terms.\r\n    IBM appeals, again arguing that the contract is\r\nunambiguous and supports its position.  In the alternative, IBM\r\nargues that the district court's sua sponte grant of summary\r\njudgment was improper and that a remand for further fact-\r\nfinding is appropriate if we should think the contract\r\nambiguous.  We reject both contentions.\r\n                           II.\r\n                                    Our review of the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment is de novo.  Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Goldstone &amp;\r\nSudalter, P.C., 128 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir. 1997).  Further,\r\n\"[u]nder Massachusetts law, interpretation of a contract is\r\nordinarily a question of law for the court,\" Coll v. PB\r\nDiagnostic Systems, Inc., 50 F.3d 1115, 1122 (1st Cir. 1995)\r\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted) and, as a\r\nquestion of law, is subject to plenary review.  \"Should the\r\ncourt find the contract language unambiguous, we interpret it\r\naccording to its plain terms.\"  Den Norske Bank, 75 F.3d at 52. \r\nIf those plain terms unambiguously favor either side, summary\r\njudgment is appropriate.  On the other hand, if the contract's\r\nterms are ambiguous, \"contract meaning normally becomes a\r\nmatter for the factfinder,\" id., and summary judgment is\r\nappropriate only if \"the extrinsic evidence presented about the\r\nparties' intended meaning is so one-sided that no reasonable\r\nperson could decide to the contrary.\"  Id. at 53 (citations,\r\ninternal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\r\n    The difference in these standards is a result of the\r\nparol evidence rule, which Massachusetts follows.  In\r\nMassachusetts, \"[t]he parol evidence rule precludes evidence of\r\nearlier or contemporaneous discussions that would modify the\r\nprovisions of a later integrated agreement which the proponent\r\nof the agreement seeks to enforce.\"  New England Fin.\r\nResources, Inc. v. Coulouras, 566 N.E.2d 1136, 1139 (Mass. App.\r\nCt. 1991).  Both parties concede that the partnership agreement\r\nby its own terms is a fully integrated document and that it\r\nrepresents the whole understanding of the parties, and so, if\r\nunambiguous, cannot be modified by evidence of earlier or\r\ncontemporaneous discussions.  The question of whether an\r\nambiguity exists in such an agreement is also \"generally a\r\nmatter of law for the court.\"  Wyner v. North Am. Specialty\r\nIns. Co., 78 F.3d 752, 754 (1st Cir. 1996).  \"An ambiguity is\r\nnot created simply because a controversy exists between the\r\nparties, each favoring an interpretation contrary to the\r\nother's.\"  Id. at 756 (internal quotation marks and citation\r\nomitted).  Rather, a contract is only ambiguous \"where an\r\nagreement's terms are inconsistent on their face or where the\r\nphraseology can support reasonable differences of opinion as to\r\nthe meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.\" \r\nColl, 50 F.3d at 1122 (internal quotation marks, alterations\r\nand citation omitted).  \r\n    With these principles in mind, we turn to the\r\nquestion posed in this case.  Under the settlement agreement,\r\nthe question posed to the court, well within our Article III\r\njurisdiction, is this:\r\n    In any proposal for refinancing the\r\n    Partnership debt involving the purchase of\r\n    the outstanding first mortgage note, does\r\n    the Partnership Agreement require, unless\r\n    otherwise requested by the Managing\r\n    Partner, that IBM first make a capital\r\n    contribution in an amount necessary to\r\n    achieve Adjusted Capital Contribution\r\n    Balance (approximately $17.5 million) and,\r\n    then, that the Partnership finances the\r\n    balance needed to refinance the debt in\r\n    accordance with the terms of the\r\n    Partnership Agreement?\r\n\nTo answer this question, we turn to the terms of the\r\nPartnership Agreement, which sets forth a complex financial\r\nrelationship between the parties.\r\n    According to  3.1 of the Agreement, Wyman initially\r\nheld a 51% interest in the partnership, while IBM was given a\r\n49% interest.  Pursuant to  3.2, Wyman's initial capital\r\ncontribution was real property, valued by the Agreement at\r\n$19.3 million, while IBM's initial capital contribution was\r\nmerely $1 million in cash.  Thus, each partner's initial\r\ncapital contribution did not reflect that partner's respective\r\nownership interest in the partnership on a pro rata basis.\r\n    The Agreement imposes different obligations on the\r\nparties that are contingent on whether \"Adjusted Capital\r\nContribution Balance\" has been achieved.  According to \r\n1.1(4), \"'Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance' shall mean the\r\ninitial point at which the Adjusted Capital Contributions of\r\nWyman and IBM are in a 51:49 ratio,\" i.e. the point at which\r\nthe two partners' adjusted capital contributions reflect each\r\npartner's ownership interest in the partnership in that ratio.\r\n    Section 1.1(3) defines \"Adjusted Capital\r\nContribution\" as follows:\r\n    \"Adjusted Capital Contribution\" shall mean\r\n    the initial Capital Contribution of a\r\n    Partner, increased by any subsequent\r\n    Capital Contributions and reduced by any\r\n    Capital Proceeds distributed to such\r\n    Partner under Section 4A.2, Second and\r\n    Fourth.\r\n\nThe Agreement's definition of \"Adjusted Capital Contribution\"\r\nmakes clear that there are two primary ways in which Adjusted\r\nCapital Contribution Balance might be achieved.  If the project\r\ngenerates sufficient revenue to allow for the distribution of\r\ncapital proceeds to the partners,  4A.2 sets forth the way in\r\nwhich such proceeds are to be distributed:\r\n         First, to Wyman, until Adjusted\r\n    Capital Contribution Balance has been\r\n    achieved, an amount equal to 6.5% per year\r\n    of the difference from time to time\r\n    between Wyman's Adjusted Capital\r\n    Contribution and IBM's Adjusted Capital\r\n    Contribution . . . .\r\n         Second, to Wyman, until Adjusted\r\n    Capital Contribution Balance.\r\n         Third, to pay the unpaid outstanding\r\n    balances if any, of loans made by any\r\n    Partner . . . to the Partnership . . .\r\n    plus any accrued but unpaid interest\r\n    thereon.\r\n         Fourth, the balance in accordance\r\n    with the Distributive Shares of the\r\n    Partners . . . .\r\n\nThus, one method by which Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance\r\ncould be achieved, contingent on the project generating\r\nsufficient revenue, would be for the partnership to repay Wyman \r\nfor its initial capital contribution of $19.3 million from the\r\ncapital proceeds of the project until a 51:49 ratio was met. \r\nThat would require, assuming no additional capital\r\ncontributions from either party, the partnership to distribute\r\napproximately $18.3 million to Wyman under  4A.2 Second.  That\r\n$18.3 million distribution would be, of course, over and above\r\nany distributions required to compensate Wyman at the rate of\r\n6.5% annually for the partnership's use of Wyman's surplus\r\ncapital contribution pursuant to  4A.2 First.  Only after such\r\ndistributions have been made (and any loans have been repaid)\r\nwould the partnership begin making payments of any capital\r\nproceeds to the partners in accordance with each partner's\r\nownership interest.\r\n    The Agreement also contemplates another method by\r\nwhich Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance might be achieved. \r\nAccording to  3.2(c), governing \"Additional Capital\r\nContributions by IBM\":\r\n    If the Partnership requires additional\r\n    funds for any purpose . . . at any time\r\n    before Adjusted Capital Contribution\r\n    Balance occurs, IBM upon notice from the\r\n    Managing Partner shall promptly contribute\r\n    the amount required (but not more than\r\n    such amount as is required to effect\r\n    Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance) and\r\n    Wyman shall not be required to contribute\r\n    any funds until Adjusted Capital\r\n    Contribution Balance occurs. . . .\r\n\nThus, if the partnership \"require[d] additional funds for any\r\npurpose,\" Wyman could call on its partner, IBM, to make\r\nadditional capital contributions up to the amount required to\r\nachieve balance.  This required IBM potentially to make\r\nadditional capital contributions of up to approximately $17.5\r\nmillion.  There is no mention in  3.2(c) of any duty first to\r\nseek money from outside lenders.\r\n    Thus, the agreement contemplated that the initial\r\nimbalance of the two partners' capital contributions could be\r\naddressed either by a payment from the partnership to Wyman\r\ntotaling approximately $18.3 million (above the 6.5% annual\r\ncharge on the use of Wyman's excess capital) if capital\r\nproceeds were forthcoming, or by additional capital\r\ncontributions from IBM potentially totaling approximately $17.5\r\nmillion, if additional capital contributions were required, or\r\nby some combination of the two.\r\n    Once Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance occurs,\r\nhowever, the parties' obligations to make capital contributions\r\nchange.  Pursuant to  3.3.1, entitled \"need for funds\":\r\n    After Adjusted Capital Contribution\r\n    Balance is achieved, if the Partnership\r\n    requires additional funds for any purpose\r\n    . . . at any time in excess of the amounts\r\n    available under the Construction Loan or\r\n    Permanent Loan, the Managing Partner \r\n    shall first attempt to arrange for the\r\n    borrowing of such funds from independent\r\n    lenders, or from a Partner or its\r\n    Affiliate or Related Person, on such terms\r\n    as are Approved by the Partners. . . .  If\r\n    the Partnership does not agree to borrow\r\n    such funds, the Partners shall make\r\n    additional Capital Contributions from time\r\n    to time in accordance with the provisions\r\n    herein and in the same percentages as\r\n    their then respective aggregate\r\n    Distributive Shares and in such amounts\r\n    which are sufficient to enable the\r\n    Partnership to carry out the purposes of\r\n    this Agreement. . . . \r\nThus, after Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance is achieved,\r\n 3.3.1 imposes a duty on the partnership first to seek funds\r\nby borrowing from third-party lenders.   If such borrowing is\r\ninsufficient to supply funds that \"the Partnership requires for\r\nany purpose,\" the partnership may then call on the partners to\r\nmake additional capital contributions \"in the same percentages\r\nas their then respective aggregate Distributive Shares . . . .\" \r\nThus, if balance had been achieved and additional funds were\r\nneeded above what was available from lenders, the partnership\r\ncould call on Wyman to contribute 51% of the amount required\r\nand IBM to contribute the remaining 49%.\r\n    Wyman's interpretation of the Agreement is relatively\r\nstraightforward.  Under  3.2(c), Wyman is given a right to\r\nmake a capital call on IBM, if the partnership \"requires\r\nadditional funds for any purpose,\" up to the amount needed to\r\nachieve Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance, i.e.,\r\napproximately $17.5 million.  Under  3.2(c), Wyman need make\r\nno additional contributions nor seek outside debt financing. \r\nBecause a refinancing of the original loan is a valid\r\n\"purpose,\" this permits Wyman to call on IBM to make such an\r\nadditional capital contribution before seeking outside debt\r\nfinancing so long as the parties' capital contributions remain\r\nout of balance.  Under  3.3, it is only after balance is\r\nachieved that Wyman has any obligation first to seek outside\r\ndebt financing.\r\n    IBM acknowledges its basic obligation to make\r\nadditional capital contributions, potentially totaling $17.5\r\nmillion, under  3.2(c) if the partnership \"requires additional\r\nfunds for any purpose.\"  IBM also acknowledges that \"any\r\npurpose\" includes the purpose of refinancing the initial\r\npermanent loan.  Finally, IBM also acknowledges that,\r\ngenerally, Wyman need not seek outside debt financing before it\r\ncalls on IBM to make additional capital contributions before\r\nbalance occurs under  3.2(c), but only after balance occurs,\r\nin accordance with  3.3.  However, IBM argues that a\r\nrefinancing of the permanent loan that provided the initial\r\nfinancing for the project represents an exception to the\r\ngeneral terms of  3.2(c).\r\n    IBM notes the longstanding principle of contract\r\ninterpretation that \"[s]pecific terms are given greater weight\r\nthan general language.\"  In re 604 Columbus Ave. Realty Trust,\r\n968 F.2d 1332, 1357 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing Lembo v. Waters,\r\n294 N.E.2d 566, 569 (Mass. App. Ct. 1973)).  IBM argues that\r\ncontract provisions specifically addressed to the permanent\r\nloan, rather than the general capital contribution provisions\r\nin  3.2(c) and 3.3, should govern.  IBM notes that the\r\ncornerstone of the project's initial financing is a $75 million\r\nnon-recourse note secured by a mortgage on the office building. \r\nSection 3.9.2 specifies how the partnership would obtain this\r\nloan:\r\n    The Partnership shall attempt to secure\r\n    financing by a lender or lenders which (a)\r\n    provides for a non-participating Permanent\r\n    Loan to the Partnership on terms and\r\n    conditions Approved by the Partners, in an\r\n    amount not less than the greater of (i)\r\n    $75,000,000 and (ii) 100% of the then\r\n    current estimate of Total Project Costs\r\n    (all of which are to be paid or reimbursed\r\n    with the proceeds of the Permanent Loan),\r\n    and so far in excess of the greater of\r\n    such figures as is appropriate in light of\r\n    required debt service thereon, other\r\n    anticipated Partnership expenses, and\r\n    anticipated Partnership income and (b)\r\n    provides for the exculpation of the \r\n    Partnership and its Partners from all\r\n    personal liability for the payment of any\r\n    interest on, or principal of, the\r\n    Permanent Loan or the performance of any\r\n    of the terms and conditions contained in\r\n    any mortgage, deed of trust or other\r\n    security instruments securing the\r\n    Permanent Loan or in any collateral\r\n    document except insofar as the Partners\r\n    may be required to obligate themselves\r\n    personally to provide such funds as may be\r\n    required to obtain a Permanent Loan of at\r\n    least $75,000,000. . . . \r\n\nThus, IBM says,  3.3.2 provides that the partnership's\r\n\"Permanent Loan,\" which was expected to provide the financing\r\nfor virtually all the partnership's expenses, should be non-\r\nrecourse to the extent possible, and specifically provides that\r\nthe loan should not require either partner to personally\r\nindemnify the loan unless and only to the extent necessary to\r\nobtain the loan.\r\n           Indeed, the $75 million figure, IBM argues further,\r\nwas intended to provide the partnership not only with\r\nsufficient funds to pay for the operation of the project but\r\nalso to repay Wyman for its disproportionate capital\r\ncontribution.  IBM contends that this reliance on debt\r\nfinancing by both parties represents, from its perspective, the\r\nlinchpin of the deal; both parties would provide little equity\r\nfinancing, and the partnership's major financing would be a\r\nnon-recourse loan secured by a mortgage on the office building\r\nitself.  To obtain such a loan, IBM further notes, IBM was\r\nrequired to enter a long-term lease for over half of the office\r\nbuilding, thus satisfying the lender that the office building\r\nwould have at the outset an anchor tenant of the stability of\r\na blue-chip corporation like IBM.  This in turn created the\r\nrisk for IBM that it would be locked into a unfavorable lease\r\nfor office space.  IBM finally argues that there is no textual\r\nconflict between  3.9.2 and  3.2(c) because the word\r\n\"requires\" in  3.2(c) should be interpreted in the refinancing\r\ncontext as incorporating a duty first to seek outside debt\r\nfinancing.\r\n           The two parties' differing interpretations thus\r\ndepend on which provisions of the contract govern IBM's\r\nundisputed obligation to provide capital contributions in any\r\nrefinancing of the permanent loan.  Wyman argues that the\r\ngeneral capital contribution obligations set forth in  3.2(c)\r\nand 3.3.1 govern.  According to those provisions, Wyman is\r\npermitted under  3.2(c) to call on IBM to make additional\r\ncapital contributions \"[i]f the Partnership requires additional\r\nfunds for any purpose\" up to the amount needed to achieve\r\nAdjusted Capital Contribution Balance.  Section 3.2(c) imposes\r\nno duty first to seek debt financing from independent lenders. \r\nAfter balance is achieved,  3.3.1 requires Wyman first to\r\nattempt to obtain third-party debt financing before calling on\r\nthe partners to make capital contributions that are\r\nproportional to their ownership interests in the partnership. \r\nAgain, IBM does not dispute its obligation to provide capital\r\ncontributions in a refinancing, but rather argues that the\r\npermanent loan provision,  3.9.2, demonstrates the parties'\r\nintent to rely primarily on debt financing, and that the\r\nprovisions of  3.9.2 thus limit IBM's general obligations to\r\nprovide additional capital contributions under  3.2(c).\r\n           Without more, the contrast between  3.9.2's reliance\r\non debt financing for the permanent loan and the clear language\r\nof  3.2(c) and 3.3.1 outlining IBM's capital contribution\r\nobligations might create sufficient ambiguity to require going\r\noutside the contract's \"four corners\" to determine the parties'\r\ntrue intent concerning IBM's capital contribution obligations\r\nin any refinancing.  See Den Norske Bank, 75 F.3d at 52.  Such\r\nextrinsic evidence would allow the court to determine whether\r\nthe parties intended to make the achievement of Adjusted\r\nCapital Contribution Balance an overriding objective, as Wyman\r\nmaintains, or whether any such goal was subordinate to the\r\npartnership's reliance on debt financing, as IBM contends.\r\n           However, resort to extrinsic evidence is not\r\nnecessary because the contract itself provides an unambiguous\r\nanswer to the question of which provision governs the parties'\r\nobligations in a refinancing.  Exhibit D of the Agreement lays\r\nout the partnership procedure for undertaking \"Major\r\nDecisions.\"  One such decision is any refinancing of the\r\npermanent loan.  Exhibit D,  C(13) describes the parties'\r\nobligations to each other in any refinancing of the permanent\r\nloan.  That provision expressly provides that \"the need for\r\ncapital contributions shall be determined in accordance with\r\nSection 3.3 of the Agreement.\"    Notably, Exh. D,  C(13) does\r\nnot refer to  3.9.2, but expressly states that  3.3 governs\r\nthe need for capital contributions in the refinancing context.\r\n           Section 3.3, in turn, lays out each partner's capital\r\ncontribution obligations \"[a]fter Adjusted Capital Contribution\r\nBalance [has been] achieved . . . .\"  Because balance has not\r\nyet been achieved, under  3.3 we must look to  3.2(c) to\r\ndetermine the parties' obligations.  That section, in turn,\r\nprovides that IBM has an obligation to provide up to the amount\r\nrequired to achieve balance (approximately $17.5 million) \"[i]f\r\nthe Partnership requires additional funds for any purpose\r\n. . . .\"\r\n           The use of the words \"for any purpose\" clearly lays\r\nout a very broad obligation to provide additional capital\r\ncontributions to the Partnership.  We do not agree with IBM's\r\nargument that the word \"requires\" limits this obligation to\r\nproviding additional capital contributions only if financing\r\ncannot be obtained from third-party lenders.  Such an\r\ninterpretation of \"requires\" would import the obligation to\r\nseek debt financing contained in  3.3.1, operative only after\r\nbalance is achieved, into  3.2(c), operative before balance\r\nis achieved.  Section 3.2(c) contains no express obligation to\r\nseek funding first from outside lenders, and this is plainly\r\nnot accidental.  To interpret  3.2(c) as implicitly containing\r\nsuch an obligation would contradict the parties' expressed\r\nintent to provide for different capital contribution\r\nobligations depending on whether the parties' adjusted capital\r\ncontributions had achieved balance or not.\r\n           IBM's proposed interpretation of \"requires\" in \r\n3.2(c) as incorporating a duty to seek debt financing in the\r\nrefinancing context also creates linguistic problems, by\r\ncreating a redundancy.  Both  3.2(c) and 3.3.1 limit the\r\nparties' obligations to provide additional capital\r\ncontributions to circumstances in which the partnership\r\n\"requires additional funds for any purpose . . . .\"  If the\r\nword \"requires\" already incorporates a duty first to seek debt\r\nfinancing in any refinancing, it would eliminate the reason for\r\nthe express language in  3.3.1 which imposes on the\r\npartnership, after balance is achieved, an obligation first to\r\nseek debt financing before calling on the partners to\r\ncontribute additional capital.  A contract should be\r\ninterpreted as a whole, so that each of its provisions has\r\noperative effect.  See Bank One Texas, N.A. v. A.J. Warehouse,\r\nInc., 968 F.2d 94, 97-98 (1st Cir. 1992); J.A. Sullivan Corp.v. Commonwealth, 494 N.E.2d 374, 378 (Mass. 1986).  IBM\r\nessentially argues that the word \"requires\" in  3.2(c)\r\nimplicitly imposes a duty to seek debt financing identical to\r\nthe duty expressly imposed by  3.3.1.  Such an interpretation\r\ndoes not square with the identical use of the word \"requires\"\r\nin  3.3.1.\r\n           IBM notes that Exh. D,  C(13) refers expressly to\r\n 3.3, but not to  3.2(c).  IBM construes this omission to\r\nexpress an intent to impose the duty to seek third-party debt\r\nfinancing contained in  3.3 in all refinancing proposals,\r\nregardless of whether Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance had\r\nbeen achieved.  Otherwise, IBM argues, Exh. D.,  C(13) would\r\nexpressly refer to both  3.2(c) and 3.3.  The difficulty with\r\nthis argument is that it requires us to ignore the text of \r\n3.3, which expressly applies only \"[a]fter Adjusted Capital\r\nContribution Balance [has been] achieved . . . .\"  Although an\r\nexpress reference to both  3.2(c) and 3.3 might have been\r\nmore artful drafting, the reference to  3.3 alone is\r\nsufficient to lead the reader from  3.3 to  3.2(c).  Section\r\n3.3 is applicable only after balance is achieved;  3.2(c)\r\nexplains how the partnership can call for capital contributions\r\nbefore balance is achieved.\r\n           IBM's next argument for imposing a duty on the\r\npartnership to seek outside debt financing is based on the\r\ndefinition of \"Permanent Loan,\" which the Agreement defines as\r\n\"such long term financings or refinancings, whether one or\r\nmore, which are described in Subsection 3.9.2.\"  Agreement \r\n1.1(50).  This definitional provision is too thin a reed on\r\nwhich to rely, given the statement in Exh. D,  C(13),\r\ngoverning any proposal for refinancing, that \"the need for\r\ncapital contributions shall be determined in accordance with\r\nSection 3.3 of the Agreement.\"  \r\n           Of course, the definitional provision,  1.1(50),\r\nstates that the provisions of  3.9.2 generally apply to both\r\nthe initial financing and to any refinancing proposal.  Yet the\r\nprovisions of  3.9.2 are drafted with the initial permanent\r\nloan in mind, and not all of them make sense as applied to a\r\nrefinancing.  For example,  3.9.2 instructs the parties to\r\nobtain a loan of at least $75 million, but a refinancing,\r\nobtained after some of the principal of the initial loan had\r\nbeen paid and perhaps on more favorable terms, would likely\r\ninvolve a loan for a smaller amount (as it did here).  IBM does\r\nnot argue that  3.9.2 imposes an obligation in any refinancing\r\nproposal to maintain indebtedness of at least $75 million. \r\nRather it admits that  3.9.2 does not apply \"to its full,\r\nliteral extent\" in the refinancing context, and given that the\r\nprovision's terms were apparently drafted with the initial\r\npermanent loan in mind, we are inclined to agree.\r\n           Moreover, the question in this case concerns capital\r\ncontribution obligations, a topic not directly addressed by \r\n3.9.2.  Exh. D,  C(13) provides expressly that in any\r\nrefinancing the \"need for additional capital contributions\" is\r\ngoverned by the general provisions of the Agreement concerning\r\nsuch contributions, i.e.  3.3 and  3.2(c) (by implicit\r\nreference), not by any allegedly different rules created by \r\n3.9.2.  Therefore, whatever relevance the requirements of \r\n3.9.2 have to a refinancing plan in general, it is plain that\r\n 3.3, and therefore  3.2(c), govern the parties' obligations\r\nto provide additional capital contributions as part of any\r\nrefinancing.  Those provisions impose a duty first to seek\r\noutside debt financing only after Adjusted Capital Contribution\r\nBalance is achieved.\r\n           IBM's final objection is that an interpretation which\r\npermits the partnership to require an additional capital\r\ncontribution of up to $17.5 million in any refinancing would\r\nrender the contract irrational.  Under Massachusetts law, \"a\r\ncontract should be construed so as to give it effect as a\r\nrational business instrument.\"  McMahon v. Monarch Life Ins.\r\nCo., 186 N.E.2d 827, 830 (Mass. 1962).  IBM poses various\r\nhypothetical scenarios designed to show that allowing Wyman to\r\ntrigger a large capital contribution obligation, potentially\r\ntotalling $17.5 million, simply by proposing a refinancing plan\r\nrenders the deal's reliance on debt financing meaningless. \r\nThis, IBM contends, could not represent the reasonable\r\nexpectations of the parties.  See id.\r\n           IBM's parade of horribles ignores the important\r\nsafeguards against such overreaching which the Agreement itself\r\nincorporates.  First, as to the initial financing,  3.9.2\r\nrequires the partnership to seek a loan \"in an amount not less\r\nthan the greater of (i) $75,000,000 and (ii) 100% of the then\r\ncurrent estimate of Total Project Costs . . . .\"  This\r\nprovision thus requires the partnership to seek an initial loan\r\nthat is at least large enough to cover all of the partnership's\r\nneeds, and in no event less than $75 million.  Under  3.9.2,\r\nthen, IBM would not be required to make any additional capital\r\ncontribution at the time of the initial financing plan unless\r\nthe partnership fell short of its borrowing goals.\r\n           Second, as to any refinancing plan (in which, as IBM\r\nacknowledges, the requirement to maintain the same level of\r\nindebtedness would not apply), it is true that IBM could be\r\nrequired to make an additional capital contribution,\r\npotentially totaling $17.5 million, so long as Adjusted Capital\r\nContribution Balance had not been achieved.    Yet this does not\r\nleave IBM without recourse.  Under Exh. D,  C(13), any\r\nrefinancing proposal is a \"Major Decision.\"  Although the\r\nAgreement does not give IBM the power to veto a refinancing\r\nproposal, as it does with some other decisions,   IBM can demand\r\narbitration of any refinancing proposal under Article XI of the\r\nAgreement.  That provision requires a neutral set of arbiters,\r\nexperienced in the Boston real estate market, to consider the\r\ncommercial reasonableness of any refinancing proposal.  If\r\nWyman proposed a refinancing plan which was not in the\r\npartnership's best interests but was merely a pretext to force\r\nIBM to make a capital contribution, then IBM could challenge\r\nthe refinancing proposal itself before the arbitration panel. \r\n           These safeguards would prevent Wyman from abusing its\r\npower as Managing Partner under  3.2(c) to call on IBM to make\r\nadditional capital contributions in any refinancing proposal. \r\nThey do not, however, limit the partnership's ability to call\r\non IBM to make additional capital contributions in an otherwise\r\nreasonable refinancing plan.  Giving Wyman such authority is\r\nnot so commercially irrational that it would cause us to\r\nquestion our interpretation of these unqualified and\r\nunambiguous provisions requiring IBM to make a capital\r\ncontribution as part of a commercially reasonable refinancing\r\nproposal.  Wyman may well have decided to agree to a\r\npartnership in which IBM's initial capital contribution was\r\nsmall only because it had the broad authority under  3.2(c)\r\nto call on IBM to make additional capital contributions that\r\nwere appropriate for the partnership's needs.  The text of the\r\nAgreement makes clear that this authority was not circumscribed\r\nby a duty to seek outside debt financing first in any\r\nrefinancing arrangement.  It is not for the courts to upset the\r\ndeal that the parties have made.\r\n           We therefore conclude, as did the district court,\r\nthat the Agreement's text provides an unambiguous answer to the\r\nquestion the parties have posed in this declaratory judgment\r\naction.  In any proposal for refinancing the Partnership debt\r\ninvolving the purchase of the outstanding first mortgage note,\r\nthe Partnership Agreement requires, unless otherwise requested\r\nby the Managing Partner, that IBM first make a capital\r\ncontribution in an amount necessary to achieve Adjusted Capital\r\nContribution Balance (approximately $17.5 million) and, then,\r\nthat the Partnership finance the balance needed to refinance\r\nthe debt in accordance with the terms of the Partnership\r\nAgreement.\r\n           One final issue remains.  This case was not resolved\r\non cross-motions for summary judgment; rather, Wyman opposed\r\nIBM's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the\r\ncontract was ambiguous, that discovery was needed to ascertain\r\nthe true intent of the parties through resort to parol\r\nevidence, and that summary judgment was therefore premature.\r\n           The touchstone in our review of the district court's\r\ndecision to grant Wyman summary judgment sua sponte is whether\r\nIBM was afforded appropriate notice and a fair opportunity to\r\npresent its arguments.  See Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc.,\r\n89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir. 1996).  Sua sponte summary judgment\r\nis also appropriate only if the litigation is sufficiently\r\nadvanced that both parties have had a reasonable opportunity\r\nto present any material evidence in their favor.  See id.\r\n           If the district court had ruled for Wyman on the\r\nground that the agreement was ambiguous and that parol evidence\r\ndemonstrated that Wyman's position was correct, we would in all\r\nlikelihood agree with IBM.  As Wyman had argued that more\r\ndiscovery was necessary, such a ruling would have presented\r\nserious problems of unfair surprise to IBM, which was entitled\r\nto develop parol evidence of its own if it failed to convince\r\nthe court on its purely textual argument and would have had no\r\nopportunity to request additional discovery under Fed. R. Civ.\r\nP. 56(f).  But the district court ruled that the agreement was\r\nunambiguous and that it supported Wyman's position.  This court\r\nhas affirmed the decision of the district court on the same\r\nbasis.\r\n           IBM's motion for summary judgment in its favor was\r\npremised on a theory that the contract was unambiguous and\r\nsupported its position.  IBM's own summary judgment motion, in\r\nthe circumstances of this case, gave IBM ample opportunity to\r\nexplain its understanding of the contract terms and to set\r\nforth its interpretation of the contract's text.  As neither\r\nthe district court nor this court considered resort to\r\nextrinsic evidence necessary, no further discovery was\r\nwarranted.  We therefore find no error, given the circumstances\r\nof this case, in the district court's sua sponte grant of\r\nsummary judgment.\r\n           We make one final observation.  Both sides have been\r\nserved well by very able counsel.  Further, the efforts of\r\ncounsel to resolve this matter, or so much of it as they were\r\nable, are to be commended.  Through the settlement, in a very\r\nreal sense, both sides have won.\r\n           The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n",

We must determine whether the partnership agreement entitles one of those parties, the 400 Wyman Street Trust (Wyman), through its trustees, to call on its partner, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), to provide a multi-million dollar capital contribution in this circumstance, involving the later refinancing of the original permanent loan.  That refinancing involves the purchase of the original mortgage note, which provided the initial financing for the project, the development of an office building in Waltham, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, IBM moved for summary judgment, arguing that the agreement was unambiguous and imposed no such obligation on it.  Wyman opposed IBM's motion, arguing that the agreement was ambiguous and that, under Massachusetts law, Wyman must therefore be permitted to submit parol evidence in the form of the testimony of its negotiating attorneys.  The district court determined that, quite apart from any parol evidence, the agreement was unambiguous in its imposition of such a capital contribution obligation on IBM, and entered summary judgment sua sponte for Wyman.  We agree that the agreement unambiguously supports Wyman's position and that resort to parol evidence is therefore unnecessary.  We also find no error in the district court's decision to enter summary judgment sua sponte for Wyman.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1986, IBM and Wyman entered into a partnership to develop and operate an office building at 400 Wyman Street, Waltham, Massachusetts.  Wyman contributed a parcel of land, valued by the parties at $19.3 million, received a majority interest of 51% in the partnership and was named the managing partner.  For its part, IBM agreed to a long-term lease commitment, and also contributed $1 million at the outset of the agreement.  IBM received a minority interest of 49% in the partnership.  IBM also agreed to make additional capital contributions, if such contributions were \"required for any purpose,\" so long as the two parties' \"adjusted capital contributions\" remained out of balance;  i.e., those contributions did not reflect the 51:49 ratio of the parties' ownership shares in the partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The partnership planned to finance the project through a $75 million non-recourse mortgage note (the \"permanent loan\"), and obtained such a loan from Citicorp Real Estate, Inc., which subsequently sold it to a consortium of foreign banks for which Citicorp served as the agent.  The partnership had difficulty generating sufficient revenue to make its loan payments.  In 1995, the partnership entered negotiations with the lenders to refinance the permanent loan, which at that time had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $72 million.  The lenders did not agree to a refinancing, but offered to sell the note outright for about $54 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wyman believed the offer was a good solution to the partnership's problems, but IBM disagreed, regarding the price as too high.  To prevent the offer from expiring, Wyman caused its corporate affiliate, Wyman Loan Corp., to purchase the note, and then proposed that the note be resold to the partnership at cost.  IBM opposed the plan.  Wyman sought arbitration under the agreement, which requires that disputes concerning a \"refinancing\" proposal be arbitrated.  IBM opposed arbitration on the ground that Wyman had not yet proposed a refinancing plan, but had only proposed that the partnership purchase the initial mortgage note, and that the issue was therefore not yet arbitrable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wyman brought suit to compel arbitration under the agreement.  The district court, agreeing with Wyman that the issue was arbitrable, granted Wyman's motion to compel arbitration.  See Bank v. International Bus.  Mach. Corp.  (Bank I ), 915 F.Supp. 491, 498-99 (D.Mass.1996).  This court reversed, holding that Wyman's motion to compel arbitration was premature because it had not submitted a concrete refinancing plan, but rather had proposed simply that the partnership acquire the initial mortgage note outright.  This court regarded Wyman's proposal at that time as a proposal to acquire an interest in real property, which is not arbitrable under the agreement, rather than a refinancing proposal, which is.  See Bank v. International Bus.  Mach. Corp.  (Bank II ), 99 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties could not agree to a more concrete refinancing plan in part because they could not agree on the extent of IBM's obligation to provide additional capital contributions.  Wyman thought the agreement provided it with the ability to call on IBM to provide a capital contribution sufficient to bring the parties' \"adjusted capital contributions\" into balance, which was approximately $17.5 million, before it was obligated to seek third-party financing for the partnership.  IBM did not dispute that it had some obligation under the agreement to provide additional capital, if such capital were required to complete the refinancing successfully, but thought that it was only required to contribute capital if sufficient funds could not be obtained at commercially reasonable rates from third-party lenders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties could not resolve this issue on their own, they agreed to a settlement which capped IBM's potential liability and posed one question for resolution by the court.  The settlement agreement permitted IBM to exit the partnership upon a capital contribution of $6 million.  This was done.  The agreement also provided that Wyman would bring a declaratory judgment action to establish which partner's interpretation of the agreement was correct.  Under the settlement agreement, if Wyman won its suit, IBM would pay it an additional lump sum of $4 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  If IBM won, it would be excused from any further liability under the partnership agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wyman filed the contemplated declaratory judgment action.  Before any discovery had taken place, IBM moved for summary judgment in its favor, arguing that the terms of the contract were unambiguous and did not require it to make the $17.5 million capital contribution.  Wyman opposed IBM's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the contract did impose such an obligation and that summary judgment was inappropriate at this stage because it wished to present parol evidence that it contended would clarify potential ambiguities in the contract.  See Den Norske Bank AS v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 75 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir.1996) (under Massachusetts law, \"extrinsic evidence is admissible to assist the factfinder in ascertaining the intent of the parties as imperfectly expressed in ambiguous contract language\").  Wyman attached affidavits to its opposition to summary judgment from the attorneys who had represented it during the partnership negotiations.  Because we do not consider this evidence, we do not describe the contents of the affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided against IBM's motion for summary judgment.  It construed the contract's language as unambiguously supporting Wyman's position.  The district court did not detect any ambiguity in the terms of the contract requiring resort to parol evidence, as Wyman had argued.  Although Wyman had not moved for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment sua sponte for Wyman, reasoning that IBM's own motion for summary judgment had given it a fair opportunity to put forward its own interpretation of the contract's terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM appeals, again arguing that the contract is unambiguous and supports its position.  In the alternative, IBM argues that the district court's sua sponte grant of summary judgment was improper and that a remand for further fact-finding is appropriate if we should think the contract ambiguous.  We reject both contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is de novo.  Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Goldstone &amp; Sudalter, P.C., 128 F.3d 10, 15 (1st Cir.1997).  Further, \"[u]nder Massachusetts law, interpretation of a contract is ordinarily a question of law for the court,\" Coll v. PB Diagnostic Systems, Inc., 50 F.3d 1115, 1122 (1st Cir.1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) and, as a question of law, is subject to plenary review.  \"Should the court find the contract language unambiguous, we interpret it according to its plain terms.\"  Den Norske Bank, 75 F.3d at 52.   If those plain terms unambiguously favor either side, summary judgment is appropriate.  On the other hand, if the contract's terms are ambiguous, \"contract meaning normally becomes a matter for the factfinder,\" id., and summary judgment is appropriate only if \"the extrinsic evidence presented about the parties' intended meaning is so one-sided that no reasonable person could decide to the contrary.\"  Id. at 53 (citations, internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difference in these standards is a result of the parol evidence rule, which Massachusetts follows.  In Massachusetts, \"[t]he parol evidence rule precludes evidence of earlier or contemporaneous discussions that would modify the provisions of a later integrated agreement which the proponent of the agreement seeks to enforce.\"  New England Fin.  Resources, Inc. v. Coulouras, 30 Mass.App.Ct. 140, 566 N.E.2d 1136, 1139 (1991).  Both parties concede that the partnership agreement by its own terms is a fully integrated document and that it represents the whole understanding of the parties, and so, if unambiguous, cannot be modified by evidence of earlier or contemporaneous discussions.  The question of whether an ambiguity exists in such an agreement is also \"generally a matter of law for the court.\"  Wyner v. North Am.  Specialty Ins. Co., 78 F.3d 752, 754 (1st Cir.1996).  \"An ambiguity is not created simply because a controversy exists between the parties, each favoring an interpretation contrary to the other's.\"  Id. at 756 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Rather, a contract is only ambiguous \"where an agreement's terms are inconsistent on their face or where the phraseology can support reasonable differences of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.\"  Coll, 50 F.3d at 1122 (internal quotation marks, alterations and citation omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the question posed in this case.  Under the settlement agreement, the question posed to the court, well within our Article III jurisdiction, is this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>In any proposal for refinancing the Partnership debt involving the purchase of the outstanding first mortgage note, does the Partnership Agreement require, unless otherwise requested by the Managing Partner, that IBM first make a capital contribution in an amount necessary to achieve Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance (approximately $17.5 million) and, then, that the Partnership finances the balance needed to refinance the debt in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To answer this question, we turn to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, which sets forth a complex financial relationship between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to &#167; 3.1 of the Agreement, Wyman initially held a 51% interest in the partnership, while IBM was given a 49% interest.  Pursuant to &#167; 3.2, Wyman's initial capital contribution was real property, valued by the Agreement at $19.3 million, while IBM's initial capital contribution was merely $1 million in cash.  Thus, each partner's initial capital contribution did not reflect that partner's respective ownership interest in the partnership on a pro rata basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement imposes different obligations on the parties that are contingent on whether \"Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance\" has been achieved.  According to &#167; 1.1(4), \" 'Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance' shall mean the initial point at which the Adjusted Capital Contributions of Wyman and IBM are in a 51:49 ratio,\" i.e. the point at which the two partners' adjusted capital contributions reflect each partner's ownership interest in the partnership in that ratio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1.1(3) defines \"Adjusted Capital Contribution\" as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>\"Adjusted Capital Contribution\" shall mean the initial Capital Contribution of a Partner, increased by any subsequent Capital Contributions and reduced by any Capital Proceeds distributed to such Partner under Section 4A.2, Second and Fourth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement's definition of \"Adjusted Capital Contribution\" makes clear that there are two primary ways in which Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance might be achieved.  If the project generates sufficient revenue to allow for the distribution of capital proceeds to the partners, &#167; 4A.2 sets forth the way in which such proceeds are to be distributed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, to Wyman, until Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance has been achieved, an amount equal to 6.5% per year of the difference from time to time between Wyman's Adjusted Capital Contribution and IBM's Adjusted Capital Contribution....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, to Wyman, until Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, to pay the unpaid outstanding balances if any, of loans made by any Partner ... to the Partnership ... plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the balance in accordance with the Distributive Shares of the Partners....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, one method by which Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance could be achieved, contingent on the project generating sufficient revenue, would be for the partnership to repay Wyman for its initial capital contribution of $19.3 million from the capital proceeds of the project until a 51:49 ratio was met.  That would require, assuming no additional capital contributions from either party, the partnership to distribute approximately $18.3 million to Wyman under &#167; 4A.2 Second.  That $18.3 million distribution would be, of course, over and above any distributions required to compensate Wyman at the rate of 6.5% annually for the partnership's use of Wyman's surplus capital contribution pursuant to &#167; 4A.2 First.  Only after such distributions have been made (and any loans have been repaid) would the partnership begin making payments of any capital proceeds to the partners in accordance with each partner's ownership interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement also contemplates another method by which Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance might be achieved.  According to &#167; 3.2(c), governing \"Additional Capital Contributions by IBM\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>If the Partnership requires additional funds for any purpose ... at any time before Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance occurs, IBM upon notice from the Managing Partner shall promptly contribute the amount required (but not more than such amount as is required to effect Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance) and Wyman shall not be required to contribute any funds until Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance occurs....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if the partnership \"require[d] additional funds for any purpose,\" Wyman could call on its partner, IBM, to make additional capital contributions up to the amount required to achieve balance.  This required IBM potentially to make additional capital contributions of up to approximately $17.5 million.  There is no mention in &#167; 3.2(c) of any duty first to seek money from outside lenders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the agreement contemplated that the initial imbalance of the two partners' capital contributions could be addressed either by a payment from the partnership to Wyman totaling approximately $18.3 million (above the 6.5% annual charge on the use of Wyman's excess capital) if capital proceeds were forthcoming, or by additional capital contributions from IBM potentially totaling approximately $17.5 million, if additional capital contributions were required, or by some combination of the two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance occurs, however, the parties' obligations to make capital contributions change.  Pursuant to &#167; 3.3.1, entitled \"need for funds\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>After Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance is achieved, if the Partnership requires additional funds for any purpose ... at any time in excess of the amounts available under the Construction Loan or Permanent Loan, the Managing Partner shall first attempt to arrange for the borrowing of such funds from independent lenders, or from a Partner or its Affiliate or Related Person, on such terms as are Approved by the Partners....  If the Partnership does not agree to borrow such funds, the Partners shall make additional Capital Contributions from time to time in accordance with the provisions herein and in the same percentages as their then respective aggregate Distributive Shares and in such amounts which are sufficient to enable the Partnership to carry out the purposes of this Agreement....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, after Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance is achieved, &#167; 3.3.1 imposes a duty on the partnership first to seek funds by borrowing from third-party lenders.  If such borrowing is insufficient to supply funds that \"the Partnership requires for any purpose,\" the partnership may then call on the partners to make additional capital contributions \"in the same percentages as their then respective aggregate Distributive Shares....\"  Thus, if balance had been achieved and additional funds were needed above what was available from lenders, the partnership could call on Wyman to contribute 51% of the amount required and IBM to contribute the remaining 49%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wyman's interpretation of the Agreement is relatively straightforward.  Under &#167; 3.2(c), Wyman is given a right to make a capital call on IBM, if the partnership \"requires additional funds for any purpose,\" up to the amount needed to achieve Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance, i.e., approximately $17.5 million.  Under &#167; 3.2(c), Wyman need make no additional contributions nor seek outside debt financing.  Because a refinancing of the original loan is a valid \"purpose,\" this permits Wyman to call on IBM to make such an additional capital contribution before seeking outside debt financing so long as the parties' capital contributions remain out of balance.  Under &#167; 3.3, it is only after balance is achieved that Wyman has any obligation first to seek outside debt financing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM acknowledges its basic obligation to make additional capital contributions, potentially totaling $17.5 million, under &#167; 3.2(c) if the partnership \"requires additional funds for any purpose.\"   IBM also acknowledges that \"any purpose\" includes the purpose of refinancing the initial permanent loan.  Finally, IBM also acknowledges that, generally, Wyman need not seek outside debt financing before it calls on IBM to make additional capital contributions before balance occurs under &#167; 3.2(c), but only after balance occurs, in accordance with &#167; 3.3.  However, IBM argues that a refinancing of the permanent loan that provided the initial financing for the project represents an exception to the general terms of &#167; 3.2(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM notes the longstanding principle of contract interpretation that \"[s]pecific terms are given greater weight than general language.\"  In re 604 Columbus Ave. Realty Trust, 968 F.2d 1332, 1357 (1st Cir.1992) (citing Lembo v. Waters, 1 Mass.App.Ct. 227, 294 N.E.2d 566, 569 (1973)).  IBM argues that contract provisions specifically addressed to the permanent loan, rather than the general capital contribution provisions in &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3, should govern.  IBM notes that the cornerstone of the project's initial financing is a $75 million non-recourse note secured by a mortgage on the office building.  Section 3.9.2 specifies how the partnership would obtain this loan:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>The Partnership shall attempt to secure financing by a lender or lenders which (a) provides for a non-participating Permanent Loan to the Partnership on terms and conditions Approved by the Partners, in an amount not less than the greater of (i) $75,000,000 and (ii) 100% of the then current estimate of Total Project Costs (all of which are to be paid or reimbursed with the proceeds of the Permanent Loan), and so far in excess of the greater of such figures as is appropriate in light of required debt service thereon, other anticipated Partnership expenses, and anticipated Partnership income and (b) provides for the exculpation of the Partnership and its Partners from all personal liability for the payment of any interest on, or principal of, the Permanent Loan or the performance of any of the terms and conditions contained in any mortgage, deed of trust or other security instruments securing the Permanent Loan or in any collateral document except insofar as the Partners may be required to obligate themselves personally to provide such funds as may be required to obtain a Permanent Loan of at least $75,000,000....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, IBM says, &#167; 3.3.2 provides that the partnership's \"Permanent Loan,\" which was expected to provide the financing for virtually all the partnership's expenses, should be non-recourse to the extent possible, and specifically provides that the loan should not require either partner to personally indemnify the loan unless and only to the extent necessary to obtain the loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the $75 million figure, IBM argues further, was intended to provide the partnership not only with sufficient funds to pay for the operation of the project but also to repay Wyman for its disproportionate capital contribution.  IBM contends that this reliance on debt financing by both parties represents, from its perspective, the linchpin of the deal;  both parties would provide little equity financing, and the partnership's major financing would be a non-recourse loan secured by a mortgage on the office building itself.  To obtain such a loan, IBM further notes, IBM was required to enter a long-term lease for over half of the office building, thus satisfying the lender that the office building would have at the outset an anchor tenant of the stability of a blue-chip corporation like IBM.  This in turn created the risk for IBM that it would be locked into a unfavorable lease for office space.  IBM finally argues that there is no textual conflict between &#167; 3.9.2 and &#167; 3.2(c) because the word \"requires\" in &#167; 3.2(c) should be interpreted in the refinancing context as incorporating a duty first to seek outside debt financing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two parties' differing interpretations thus depend on which provisions of the contract govern IBM's undisputed obligation to provide capital contributions in any refinancing of the permanent loan.  Wyman argues that the general capital contribution obligations set forth in &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3.1 govern.  According to those provisions, Wyman is permitted under &#167; 3.2(c) to call on IBM to make additional capital contributions \"[i]f the Partnership requires additional funds for any purpose\" up to the amount needed to achieve Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance.  Section 3.2(c) imposes no duty first to seek debt financing from independent lenders.  After balance is achieved, &#167; 3.3.1 requires Wyman first to attempt to obtain third-party debt financing before calling on the partners to make capital contributions that are proportional to their ownership interests in the partnership.  Again, IBM does not dispute its obligation to provide capital contributions in a refinancing, but rather argues that the permanent loan provision, &#167; 3.9.2, demonstrates the parties' intent to rely primarily on debt financing, and that the provisions of &#167; 3.9.2 thus limit IBM's general obligations to provide additional capital contributions under &#167; 3.2(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without more, the contrast between &#167; 3.9.2's reliance on debt financing for the permanent loan and the clear language of &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3.1 outlining IBM's capital contribution obligations might create sufficient ambiguity to require going outside the contract's \"four corners\" to determine the parties' true intent concerning IBM's capital contribution obligations in any refinancing.  See Den Norske Bank, 75 F.3d at 52.   Such extrinsic evidence would allow the court to determine whether the parties intended to make the achievement of Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance an overriding objective, as Wyman maintains, or whether any such goal was subordinate to the partnership's reliance on debt financing, as IBM contends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, resort to extrinsic evidence is not necessary because the contract itself provides an unambiguous answer to the question of which provision governs the parties' obligations in a refinancing.  Exhibit D of the Agreement lays out the partnership procedure for undertaking \"Major Decisions.\"   One such decision is any refinancing of the permanent loan.  Exhibit D, &#167; C(13) describes the parties' obligations to each other in any refinancing of the permanent loan.  That provision expressly provides that \"the need for capital contributions shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.3 of the Agreement.\"   Notably, Exh.  D, &#167; C(13) does not refer to &#167; 3.9.2, but expressly states that &#167; 3.3 governs the need for capital contributions in the refinancing context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3.3, in turn, lays out each partner's capital contribution obligations \"[a]fter Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance [has been] achieved....\"  Because balance has not yet been achieved, under &#167; 3.3 we must look to &#167; 3.2(c) to determine the parties' obligations.  That section, in turn, provides that IBM has an obligation to provide up to the amount required to achieve balance (approximately $17.5 million) \"[i]f the Partnership requires additional funds for any purpose....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of the words \"for any purpose\" clearly lays out a very broad obligation to provide additional capital contributions to the Partnership.  We do not agree with IBM's argument that the word \"requires\" limits this obligation to providing additional capital contributions only if financing cannot be obtained from third-party lenders.  Such an interpretation of \"requires\" would import the obligation to seek debt financing contained in &#167; 3.3.1, operative only after balance is achieved, into &#167; 3.2(c), operative before balance is achieved.  Section 3.2(c) contains no express obligation to seek funding first from outside lenders, and this is plainly not accidental.  To interpret &#167; 3.2(c) as implicitly containing such an obligation would contradict the parties' expressed intent to provide for different capital contribution obligations depending on whether the parties' adjusted capital contributions had achieved balance or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM's proposed interpretation of \"requires\" in &#167; 3.2(c) as incorporating a duty to seek debt financing in the refinancing context also creates linguistic problems, by creating a redundancy.  Both &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3.1 limit the parties' obligations to provide additional capital contributions to circumstances in which the partnership \"requires additional funds for any purpose....\"  If the word \"requires\" already incorporates a duty first to seek debt financing in any refinancing, it would eliminate the reason for the express language in &#167; 3.3.1 which imposes on the partnership, after balance is achieved, an obligation first to seek debt financing before calling on the partners to contribute additional capital.  A contract should be interpreted as a whole, so that each of its provisions has operative effect.  See Bank One Texas, N.A. v. A.J. Warehouse, Inc., 968 F.2d 94, 97-98 (1st Cir.1992);  J.A. Sullivan Corp. v. Commonwealth, 397 Mass. 789, 494 N.E.2d 374, 378 (1986).  IBM essentially argues that the word \"requires\" in &#167; 3.2(c) implicitly imposes a duty to seek debt financing identical to the duty expressly imposed by &#167; 3.3.1.  Such an interpretation does not square with the identical use of the word \"requires\" in &#167; 3.3.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM notes that Exh.  D, &#167; C(13) refers expressly to &#167; 3.3, but not to &#167; 3.2(c).  IBM construes this omission to express an intent to impose the duty to seek third-party debt financing contained in &#167; 3.3 in all refinancing proposals, regardless of whether Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance had been achieved.  Otherwise, IBM argues, Exh.  D., &#167; C(13) would expressly refer to both &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3.  The difficulty with this argument is that it requires us to ignore the text of &#167; 3.3, which expressly applies only \"[a]fter Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance [has been] achieved....\"  Although an express reference to both &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3 might have been more artful drafting, the reference to &#167; 3.3 alone is sufficient to lead the reader from &#167; 3.3 to &#167; 3.2(c).  Section 3.3 is applicable only after balance is achieved;  &#167; 3.2(c) explains how the partnership can call for capital contributions before balance is achieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM's next argument for imposing a duty on the partnership to seek outside debt financing is based on the definition of \"Permanent Loan,\" which the Agreement defines as \"such long term financings or refinancings, whether one or more, which are described in Subsection 3.9.2.\"   Agreement &#167; 1.1(50).  This definitional provision is too thin a reed on which to rely, given the statement in Exh.  D, &#167; C(13), governing any proposal for refinancing, that \"the need for capital contributions shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.3 of the Agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the definitional provision, &#167; 1.1(50), states that the provisions of &#167; 3.9.2 generally apply to both the initial financing and to any refinancing proposal.  Yet the provisions of &#167; 3.9.2 are drafted with the initial permanent loan in mind, and not all of them make sense as applied to a refinancing.  For example, &#167; 3.9.2 instructs the parties to obtain a loan of at least $75 million, but a refinancing, obtained after some of the principal of the initial loan had been paid and perhaps on more favorable terms, would likely involve a loan for a smaller amount (as it did here).  IBM does not argue that &#167; 3.9.2 imposes an obligation in any refinancing proposal to maintain indebtedness of at least $75 million.  Rather it admits that &#167; 3.9.2 does not apply \"to its full, literal extent\" in the refinancing context, and given that the provision's terms were apparently drafted with the initial permanent loan in mind, we are inclined to agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the question in this case concerns capital contribution obligations, a topic not directly addressed by &#167; 3.9.2.  Exh. D, &#167; C(13) provides expressly that in any refinancing the \"need for additional capital contributions\" is governed by the general provisions of the Agreement concerning such contributions, i.e. &#167; 3.3 and &#167; 3.2(c) (by implicit reference), not by any allegedly different rules created by &#167; 3.9.2.  Therefore, whatever relevance the requirements of &#167; 3.9.2 have to a refinancing plan in general, it is plain that &#167; 3.3, and therefore &#167; 3.2(c), govern the parties' obligations to provide additional capital contributions as part of any refinancing.  Those provisions impose a duty first to seek outside debt financing only after Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance is achieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM's final objection is that an interpretation which permits the partnership to require an additional capital contribution of up to $17.5 million in any refinancing would render the contract irrational.  Under Massachusetts law, \"a contract should be construed so as to give it effect as a rational business instrument.\"  McMahon v. Monarch Life Ins. Co., 345 Mass. 261, 186 N.E.2d 827, 830 (1962).  IBM poses various hypothetical scenarios designed to show that allowing Wyman to trigger a large capital contribution obligation, potentially totalling $17.5 million, simply by proposing a refinancing plan renders the deal's reliance on debt financing meaningless.  This, IBM contends, could not represent the reasonable expectations of the parties.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM's parade of horribles ignores the important safeguards against such overreaching which the Agreement itself incorporates.  First, as to the initial financing, &#167; 3.9.2 requires the partnership to seek a loan \"in an amount not less than the greater of (i) $75,000,000 and (ii) 100% of the then current estimate of Total Project Costs....\"  This provision thus requires the partnership to seek an initial loan that is at least large enough to cover all of the partnership's needs, and in no event less than $75 million.  Under &#167; 3.9.2, then, IBM would not be required to make any additional capital contribution at the time of the initial financing plan unless the partnership fell short of its borrowing goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as to any refinancing plan (in which, as IBM acknowledges, the requirement to maintain the same level of indebtedness would not apply), it is true that IBM could be required to make an additional capital contribution, potentially totaling $17.5 million, so long as Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance had not been achieved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Yet this does not leave IBM without recourse.  Under Exh.  D, &#167; C(13), any refinancing proposal is a \"Major Decision.\"   Although the Agreement does not give IBM the power to veto a refinancing proposal, as it does with some other decisions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> IBM can demand arbitration of any refinancing proposal under Article XI of the Agreement.  That provision requires a neutral set of arbiters, experienced in the Boston real estate market, to consider the commercial reasonableness of any refinancing proposal.  If Wyman proposed a refinancing plan which was not in the partnership's best interests but was merely a pretext to force IBM to make a capital contribution, then IBM could challenge the refinancing proposal itself before the arbitration panel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These safeguards would prevent Wyman from abusing its power as Managing Partner under &#167; 3.2(c) to call on IBM to make additional capital contributions in any refinancing proposal.  They do not, however, limit the partnership's ability to call on IBM to make additional capital contributions in an otherwise reasonable refinancing plan.  Giving Wyman such authority is not so commercially irrational that it would cause us to question our interpretation of these unqualified and unambiguous provisions requiring IBM to make a capital contribution as part of a commercially reasonable refinancing proposal.  Wyman may well have decided to agree to a partnership in which IBM's initial capital contribution was small only because it had the broad authority under &#167; 3.2(c) to call on IBM to make additional capital contributions that were appropriate for the partnership's needs.  The text of the Agreement makes clear that this authority was not circumscribed by a duty to seek outside debt financing first in any refinancing arrangement.  It is not for the courts to upset the deal that the parties have made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude, as did the district court, that the Agreement's text provides an unambiguous answer to the question the parties have posed in this declaratory judgment action.  In any proposal for refinancing the Partnership debt involving the purchase of the outstanding first mortgage note, the Partnership Agreement requires, unless otherwise requested by the Managing Partner, that IBM first make a capital contribution in an amount necessary to achieve Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance (approximately $17.5 million) and, then, that the Partnership finance the balance needed to refinance the debt in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final issue remains.  This case was not resolved on cross-motions for summary judgment;  rather, Wyman opposed IBM's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the contract was ambiguous, that discovery was needed to ascertain the true intent of the parties through resort to parol evidence, and that summary judgment was therefore premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The touchstone in our review of the district court's decision to grant Wyman summary judgment sua sponte is whether IBM was afforded appropriate notice and a fair opportunity to present its arguments.  See Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., 89 F.3d 24, 29 (1st Cir.1996).  Sua sponte summary judgment is also appropriate only if the litigation is sufficiently advanced that both parties have had a reasonable opportunity to present any material evidence in their favor.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court had ruled for Wyman on the ground that the agreement was ambiguous and that parol evidence demonstrated that Wyman's position was correct, we would in all likelihood agree with IBM.  As Wyman had argued that more discovery was necessary, such a ruling would have presented serious problems of unfair surprise to IBM, which was entitled to develop parol evidence of its own if it failed to convince the court on its purely textual argument and would have had no opportunity to request additional discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f).  But the district court ruled that the agreement was unambiguous and that it supported Wyman's position.  This court has affirmed the decision of the district court on the same basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM's motion for summary judgment in its favor was premised on a theory that the contract was unambiguous and supported its position.  IBM's own summary judgment motion, in the circumstances of this case, gave IBM ample opportunity to explain its understanding of the contract terms and to set forth its interpretation of the contract's text.  As neither the district court nor this court considered resort to extrinsic evidence necessary, no further discovery was warranted.  We therefore find no error, given the circumstances of this case, in the district court's sua sponte grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make one final observation.  Both sides have been served well by very able counsel.  Further, the efforts of counsel to resolve this matter, or so much of it as they were able, are to be commended.  Through the settlement, in a very real sense, both sides have won.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Throughout this opinion we will refer to the requested capital contribution necessary to achieve Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance, defined below, as being approximately $17.5 million.  We recognize that any payment that the resolution of this case requires IBM to make is reduced by the $6 million already paid and is further capped by the $4 million figure in the settlement agreement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Massachusetts law also may permit, in limited circumstances, the use of extrinsic evidence \"for the very purpose of deciding whether the documentary expression of the contract is ambiguous.\"  Donoghue v. IBC USA (Publications), Inc., 70 F.3d 206, 215 (1st Cir.1995).  As Donoghue makes clear, however, the purpose of allowing such a \"peek\" at extrinsic evidence under some circumstances is merely to ensure that the contract is read \" 'in light of the circumstances of its execution' \" rather than as some hypothetical document existing outside the parties' real business relationship.

To the extent that Massachusetts permits the limited use of extrinsic evidence in order to shed light on the circumstances of the contract's execution, no such evidence would be helpful in resolving whether the contract terms in this case are ambiguous;  rather, allowing such evidence would simply frustrate the policy of the parol evidence rule.  As a Massachusetts court has observed:</p>\n        <p>Claims of ambiguity ... do not hold the line against summary judgment if the documents do not reflect ambiguity on the point in question....  What a party remembers about what was said at a business conference is easily colored by what that person wished to be resolved by the discussion.  The hoped for result metamorphoses into fact.  That is why lawyers draw commercial instruments to state as precisely as they can the rights and duties of the parties, and that is why the parties sign those agreements.</p>\n        <p>USTrust v. Henley &amp; Warren Management, Inc., 40 Mass.App.Ct. 337, 663 N.E.2d 1238, 1242 (1996).

We must determine whether the partnership agreement entitles one of those parties, the 400 Wyman Street Trust (Wyman), through its trustees, to call on its partner, International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), to provide a multi-million dollar capital contribution in this circumstance, involving the later refinancing of the original permanent loan.  That refinancing involves the purchase of the original mortgage note, which provided the initial financing for the project, the development of an office building in Waltham, Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the district court, IBM moved for summary judgment, arguing that the agreement was unambiguous and imposed no such obligation on it.  Wyman opposed IBM's motion, arguing that the agreement was ambiguous and that, under Massachusetts law, Wyman must therefore be permitted to submit parol evidence in the form of the testimony of its negotiating attorneys.  The district court determined that, quite apart from any parol evidence, the agreement was unambiguous in its imposition of such a capital contribution obligation on IBM, and entered summary judgment sua sponte for Wyman.  We agree that the agreement unambiguously supports Wyman's position and that resort to parol evidence is therefore unnecessary.  We also find no error in the district court's decision to enter summary judgment sua sponte for Wyman.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1986, IBM and Wyman entered into a partnership to develop and operate an office building at 400 Wyman Street, Waltham, Massachusetts.  Wyman contributed a parcel of land, valued by the parties at $19.3 million, received a majority interest of 51% in the partnership and was named the managing partner.  For its part, IBM agreed to a long-term lease commitment, and also contributed $1 million at the outset of the agreement.  IBM received a minority interest of 49% in the partnership.  IBM also agreed to make additional capital contributions, if such contributions were \"required for any purpose,\" so long as the two parties' \"adjusted capital contributions\" remained out of balance;  i.e., those contributions did not reflect the 51:49 ratio of the parties' ownership shares in the partnership.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The partnership planned to finance the project through a $75 million non-recourse mortgage note (the \"permanent loan\"), and obtained such a loan from Citicorp Real Estate, Inc., which subsequently sold it to a consortium of foreign banks for which Citicorp served as the agent.  The partnership had difficulty generating sufficient revenue to make its loan payments.  In 1995, the partnership entered negotiations with the lenders to refinance the permanent loan, which at that time had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $72 million.  The lenders did not agree to a refinancing, but offered to sell the note outright for about $54 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wyman believed the offer was a good solution to the partnership's problems, but IBM disagreed, regarding the price as too high.  To prevent the offer from expiring, Wyman caused its corporate affiliate, Wyman Loan Corp., to purchase the note, and then proposed that the note be resold to the partnership at cost.  IBM opposed the plan.  Wyman sought arbitration under the agreement, which requires that disputes concerning a \"refinancing\" proposal be arbitrated.  IBM opposed arbitration on the ground that Wyman had not yet proposed a refinancing plan, but had only proposed that the partnership purchase the initial mortgage note, and that the issue was therefore not yet arbitrable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wyman brought suit to compel arbitration under the agreement.  The district court, agreeing with Wyman that the issue was arbitrable, granted Wyman's motion to compel arbitration.  See Bank v. International Bus.  Mach. Corp.  (Bank I ), <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></span>, 498-99 (D.Mass.1996).  This court reversed, holding that Wyman's motion to compel arbitration was premature because it had not submitted a concrete refinancing plan, but rather had proposed simply that the partnership acquire the initial mortgage note outright.  This court regarded Wyman's proposal at that time as a proposal to acquire an interest in real property, which is not arbitrable under the agreement, rather than a refinancing proposal, which is.  See Bank v. International Bus.  Mach. Corp.  (Bank II ), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197058\"><a href=\"/opinion/197058/bank-v-ibmc/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties could not agree to a more concrete refinancing plan in part because they could not agree on the extent of IBM's obligation to provide additional capital contributions.  Wyman thought the agreement provided it with the ability to call on IBM to provide a capital contribution sufficient to bring the parties' \"adjusted capital contributions\" into balance, which was approximately $17.5 million, before it was obligated to seek third-party financing for the partnership.  IBM did not dispute that it had some obligation under the agreement to provide additional capital, if such capital were required to complete the refinancing successfully, but thought that it was only required to contribute capital if sufficient funds could not be obtained at commercially reasonable rates from third-party lenders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties could not resolve this issue on their own, they agreed to a settlement which capped IBM's potential liability and posed one question for resolution by the court.  The settlement agreement permitted IBM to exit the partnership upon a capital contribution of $6 million.  This was done.  The agreement also provided that Wyman would bring a declaratory judgment action to establish which partner's interpretation of the agreement was correct.  Under the settlement agreement, if Wyman won its suit, IBM would pay it an additional lump sum of $4 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  If IBM won, it would be excused from any further liability under the partnership agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wyman filed the contemplated declaratory judgment action.  Before any discovery had taken place, IBM moved for summary judgment in its favor, arguing that the terms of the contract were unambiguous and did not require it to make the $17.5 million capital contribution.  Wyman opposed IBM's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the contract did impose such an obligation and that summary judgment was inappropriate at this stage because it wished to present parol evidence that it contended would clarify potential ambiguities in the contract.  See Den Norske Bank AS v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196552\"><a href=\"/opinion/196552/den-norske-bank-as-v-first-natl-of-bost/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.1996) (under Massachusetts law, \"extrinsic evidence is admissible to assist the factfinder in ascertaining the intent of the parties as imperfectly expressed in ambiguous contract language\").  Wyman attached affidavits to its opposition to summary judgment from the attorneys who had represented it during the partnership negotiations.  Because we do not consider this evidence, we do not describe the contents of the affidavits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court decided against IBM's motion for summary judgment.  It construed the contract's language as unambiguously supporting Wyman's position.  The district court did not detect any ambiguity in the terms of the contract requiring resort to parol evidence, as Wyman had argued.  Although Wyman had not moved for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment sua sponte for Wyman, reasoning that IBM's own motion for summary judgment had given it a fair opportunity to put forward its own interpretation of the contract's terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM appeals, again arguing that the contract is unambiguous and supports its position.  In the alternative, IBM argues that the district court's sua sponte grant of summary judgment was improper and that a remand for further fact-finding is appropriate if we should think the contract ambiguous.  We reject both contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgment is de novo.

If those plain terms unambiguously favor either side, summary judgment is appropriate.  On the other hand, if the contract's terms are ambiguous, \"contract meaning normally becomes a matter for the factfinder,\" id., and summary judgment is appropriate only if \"the extrinsic evidence presented about the parties' intended meaning is so one-sided that no reasonable person could decide to the contrary.\"  Id. at 53 (citations, internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The difference in these standards is a result of the parol evidence rule, which Massachusetts follows.  In Massachusetts, \"[t]he parol evidence rule precludes evidence of earlier or contemporaneous discussions that would modify the provisions of a later integrated agreement which the proponent of the agreement seeks to enforce.\"  New England Fin.  Resources, Inc. v. Coulouras, 30 Mass.App.Ct. 140, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102187\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102187/new-england-financial-resources-v-coulouras/\"><span class=\"volume\">566</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span>, 1139 (1991).  Both parties concede that the partnership agreement by its own terms is a fully integrated document and that it represents the whole understanding of the parties, and so, if unambiguous, cannot be modified by evidence of earlier or contemporaneous discussions.  The question of whether an ambiguity exists in such an agreement is also \"generally a matter of law for the court.\"  Wyner v. North Am.  Specialty Ins.

Rather, a contract is only ambiguous \"where an agreement's terms are inconsistent on their face or where the phraseology can support reasonable differences of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.\"  Coll, 50 F.3d at 1122 (internal quotation marks, alterations and citation omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the question posed in this case.  Under the settlement agreement, the question posed to the court, well within our Article III jurisdiction, is this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>In any proposal for refinancing the Partnership debt involving the purchase of the outstanding first mortgage note, does the Partnership Agreement require, unless otherwise requested by the Managing Partner, that IBM first make a capital contribution in an amount necessary to achieve Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance (approximately $17.5 million) and, then, that the Partnership finances the balance needed to refinance the debt in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To answer this question, we turn to the terms of the Partnership Agreement, which sets forth a complex financial relationship between the parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to &#167; 3.1 of the Agreement, Wyman initially held a 51% interest in the partnership, while IBM was given a 49% interest.  Pursuant to &#167; 3.2, Wyman's initial capital contribution was real property, valued by the Agreement at $19.3 million, while IBM's initial capital contribution was merely $1 million in cash.  Thus, each partner's initial capital contribution did not reflect that partner's respective ownership interest in the partnership on a pro rata basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement imposes different obligations on the parties that are contingent on whether \"Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance\" has been achieved.  According to &#167; 1.1(4), \" 'Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance' shall mean the initial point at which the Adjusted Capital Contributions of Wyman and IBM are in a 51:49 ratio,\" i.e. the point at which the two partners' adjusted capital contributions reflect each partner's ownership interest in the partnership in that ratio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1.1(3) defines \"Adjusted Capital Contribution\" as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>\"Adjusted Capital Contribution\" shall mean the initial Capital Contribution of a Partner, increased by any subsequent Capital Contributions and reduced by any Capital Proceeds distributed to such Partner under Section 4A.2, Second and Fourth.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement's definition of \"Adjusted Capital Contribution\" makes clear that there are two primary ways in which Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance might be achieved.  If the project generates sufficient revenue to allow for the distribution of capital proceeds to the partners, &#167; 4A.2 sets forth the way in which such proceeds are to be distributed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, to Wyman, until Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance has been achieved, an amount equal to 6.5% per year of the difference from time to time between Wyman's Adjusted Capital Contribution and IBM's Adjusted Capital Contribution....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, to Wyman, until Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, to pay the unpaid outstanding balances if any, of loans made by any Partner ... to the Partnership ... plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the balance in accordance with the Distributive Shares of the Partners....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, one method by which Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance could be achieved, contingent on the project generating sufficient revenue, would be for the partnership to repay Wyman for its initial capital contribution of $19.3 million from the capital proceeds of the project until a 51:49 ratio was met.  That would require, assuming no additional capital contributions from either party, the partnership to distribute approximately $18.3 million to Wyman under &#167; 4A.2 Second.  That $18.3 million distribution would be, of course, over and above any distributions required to compensate Wyman at the rate of 6.5% annually for the partnership's use of Wyman's surplus capital contribution pursuant to &#167; 4A.2 First.  Only after such distributions have been made (and any loans have been repaid) would the partnership begin making payments of any capital proceeds to the partners in accordance with each partner's ownership interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement also contemplates another method by which Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance might be achieved.  According to &#167; 3.2(c), governing \"Additional Capital Contributions by IBM\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>If the Partnership requires additional funds for any purpose ... at any time before Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance occurs, IBM upon notice from the Managing Partner shall promptly contribute the amount required (but not more than such amount as is required to effect Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance) and Wyman shall not be required to contribute any funds until Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance occurs....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, if the partnership \"require[d] additional funds for any purpose,\" Wyman could call on its partner, IBM, to make additional capital contributions up to the amount required to achieve balance.  This required IBM potentially to make additional capital contributions of up to approximately $17.5 million.  There is no mention in &#167; 3.2(c) of any duty first to seek money from outside lenders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the agreement contemplated that the initial imbalance of the two partners' capital contributions could be addressed either by a payment from the partnership to Wyman totaling approximately $18.3 million (above the 6.5% annual charge on the use of Wyman's excess capital) if capital proceeds were forthcoming, or by additional capital contributions from IBM potentially totaling approximately $17.5 million, if additional capital contributions were required, or by some combination of the two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance occurs, however, the parties' obligations to make capital contributions change.  Pursuant to &#167; 3.3.1, entitled \"need for funds\":</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>After Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance is achieved, if the Partnership requires additional funds for any purpose ... at any time in excess of the amounts available under the Construction Loan or Permanent Loan, the Managing Partner shall first attempt to arrange for the borrowing of such funds from independent lenders, or from a Partner or its Affiliate or Related Person, on such terms as are Approved by the Partners....  If the Partnership does not agree to borrow such funds, the Partners shall make additional Capital Contributions from time to time in accordance with the provisions herein and in the same percentages as their then respective aggregate Distributive Shares and in such amounts which are sufficient to enable the Partnership to carry out the purposes of this Agreement....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, after Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance is achieved, &#167; 3.3.1 imposes a duty on the partnership first to seek funds by borrowing from third-party lenders.  If such borrowing is insufficient to supply funds that \"the Partnership requires for any purpose,\" the partnership may then call on the partners to make additional capital contributions \"in the same percentages as their then respective aggregate Distributive Shares....\"  Thus, if balance had been achieved and additional funds were needed above what was available from lenders, the partnership could call on Wyman to contribute 51% of the amount required and IBM to contribute the remaining 49%.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wyman's interpretation of the Agreement is relatively straightforward.  Under &#167; 3.2(c), Wyman is given a right to make a capital call on IBM, if the partnership \"requires additional funds for any purpose,\" up to the amount needed to achieve Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance, i.e., approximately $17.5 million.  Under &#167; 3.2(c), Wyman need make no additional contributions nor seek outside debt financing.  Because a refinancing of the original loan is a valid \"purpose,\" this permits Wyman to call on IBM to make such an additional capital contribution before seeking outside debt financing so long as the parties' capital contributions remain out of balance.  Under &#167; 3.3, it is only after balance is achieved that Wyman has any obligation first to seek outside debt financing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM acknowledges its basic obligation to make additional capital contributions, potentially totaling $17.5 million, under &#167; 3.2(c) if the partnership \"requires additional funds for any purpose.\"   IBM also acknowledges that \"any purpose\" includes the purpose of refinancing the initial permanent loan.  Finally, IBM also acknowledges that, generally, Wyman need not seek outside debt financing before it calls on IBM to make additional capital contributions before balance occurs under &#167; 3.2(c), but only after balance occurs, in accordance with &#167; 3.3.  However, IBM argues that a refinancing of the permanent loan that provided the initial financing for the project represents an exception to the general terms of &#167; 3.2(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM notes the longstanding principle of contract interpretation that \"[s]pecific terms are given greater weight than general language.\"  In re 604 Columbus Ave. Realty Trust, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586807\"><a href=\"/opinion/586807/in-re-604-columbus-avenue-realty-trust-debtor-capitol-bank-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1332</span></a></span>, 1357 (1st Cir.1992) (citing Lembo v. Waters, 1 Mass.App.Ct. 227, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2242456\"><a href=\"/opinion/2242456/lembo-v-waters/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span>, 569 (1973)).  IBM argues that contract provisions specifically addressed to the permanent loan, rather than the general capital contribution provisions in &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3, should govern.  IBM notes that the cornerstone of the project's initial financing is a $75 million non-recourse note secured by a mortgage on the office building.  Section 3.9.2 specifies how the partnership would obtain this loan:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>The Partnership shall attempt to secure financing by a lender or lenders which (a) provides for a non-participating Permanent Loan to the Partnership on terms and conditions Approved by the Partners, in an amount not less than the greater of (i) $75,000,000 and (ii) 100% of the then current estimate of Total Project Costs (all of which are to be paid or reimbursed with the proceeds of the Permanent Loan), and so far in excess of the greater of such figures as is appropriate in light of required debt service thereon, other anticipated Partnership expenses, and anticipated Partnership income and (b) provides for the exculpation of the Partnership and its Partners from all personal liability for the payment of any interest on, or principal of, the Permanent Loan or the performance of any of the terms and conditions contained in any mortgage, deed of trust or other security instruments securing the Permanent Loan or in any collateral document except insofar as the Partners may be required to obligate themselves personally to provide such funds as may be required to obtain a Permanent Loan of at least $75,000,000....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, IBM says, &#167; 3.3.2 provides that the partnership's \"Permanent Loan,\" which was expected to provide the financing for virtually all the partnership's expenses, should be non-recourse to the extent possible, and specifically provides that the loan should not require either partner to personally indemnify the loan unless and only to the extent necessary to obtain the loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the $75 million figure, IBM argues further, was intended to provide the partnership not only with sufficient funds to pay for the operation of the project but also to repay Wyman for its disproportionate capital contribution.  IBM contends that this reliance on debt financing by both parties represents, from its perspective, the linchpin of the deal;  both parties would provide little equity financing, and the partnership's major financing would be a non-recourse loan secured by a mortgage on the office building itself.  To obtain such a loan, IBM further notes, IBM was required to enter a long-term lease for over half of the office building, thus satisfying the lender that the office building would have at the outset an anchor tenant of the stability of a blue-chip corporation like IBM.  This in turn created the risk for IBM that it would be locked into a unfavorable lease for office space.  IBM finally argues that there is no textual conflict between &#167; 3.9.2 and &#167; 3.2(c) because the word \"requires\" in &#167; 3.2(c) should be interpreted in the refinancing context as incorporating a duty first to seek outside debt financing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two parties' differing interpretations thus depend on which provisions of the contract govern IBM's undisputed obligation to provide capital contributions in any refinancing of the permanent loan.  Wyman argues that the general capital contribution obligations set forth in &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3.1 govern.  According to those provisions, Wyman is permitted under &#167; 3.2(c) to call on IBM to make additional capital contributions \"[i]f the Partnership requires additional funds for any purpose\" up to the amount needed to achieve Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance.  Section 3.2(c) imposes no duty first to seek debt financing from independent lenders.  After balance is achieved, &#167; 3.3.1 requires Wyman first to attempt to obtain third-party debt financing before calling on the partners to make capital contributions that are proportional to their ownership interests in the partnership.  Again, IBM does not dispute its obligation to provide capital contributions in a refinancing, but rather argues that the permanent loan provision, &#167; 3.9.2, demonstrates the parties' intent to rely primarily on debt financing, and that the provisions of &#167; 3.9.2 thus limit IBM's general obligations to provide additional capital contributions under &#167; 3.2(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without more, the contrast between &#167; 3.9.2's reliance on debt financing for the permanent loan and the clear language of &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3.1 outlining IBM's capital contribution obligations might create sufficient ambiguity to require going outside the contract's \"four corners\" to determine the parties' true intent concerning IBM's capital contribution obligations in any refinancing.  See Den Norske Bank, 75 F.3d at 52.   Such extrinsic evidence would allow the court to determine whether the parties intended to make the achievement of Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance an overriding objective, as Wyman maintains, or whether any such goal was subordinate to the partnership's reliance on debt financing, as IBM contends.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, resort to extrinsic evidence is not necessary because the contract itself provides an unambiguous answer to the question of which provision governs the parties' obligations in a refinancing.  Exhibit D of the Agreement lays out the partnership procedure for undertaking \"Major Decisions.\"   One such decision is any refinancing of the permanent loan.  Exhibit D, &#167; C(13) describes the parties' obligations to each other in any refinancing of the permanent loan.  That provision expressly provides that \"the need for capital contributions shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.3 of the Agreement.\"   Notably, Exh.  D, &#167; C(13) does not refer to &#167; 3.9.2, but expressly states that &#167; 3.3 governs the need for capital contributions in the refinancing context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3.3, in turn, lays out each partner's capital contribution obligations \"[a]fter Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance [has been] achieved....\"  Because balance has not yet been achieved, under &#167; 3.3 we must look to &#167; 3.2(c) to determine the parties' obligations.  That section, in turn, provides that IBM has an obligation to provide up to the amount required to achieve balance (approximately $17.5 million) \"[i]f the Partnership requires additional funds for any purpose....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The use of the words \"for any purpose\" clearly lays out a very broad obligation to provide additional capital contributions to the Partnership.  We do not agree with IBM's argument that the word \"requires\" limits this obligation to providing additional capital contributions only if financing cannot be obtained from third-party lenders.  Such an interpretation of \"requires\" would import the obligation to seek debt financing contained in &#167; 3.3.1, operative only after balance is achieved, into &#167; 3.2(c), operative before balance is achieved.  Section 3.2(c) contains no express obligation to seek funding first from outside lenders, and this is plainly not accidental.  To interpret &#167; 3.2(c) as implicitly containing such an obligation would contradict the parties' expressed intent to provide for different capital contribution obligations depending on whether the parties' adjusted capital contributions had achieved balance or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM's proposed interpretation of \"requires\" in &#167; 3.2(c) as incorporating a duty to seek debt financing in the refinancing context also creates linguistic problems, by creating a redundancy.  Both &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3.1 limit the parties' obligations to provide additional capital contributions to circumstances in which the partnership \"requires additional funds for any purpose....\"  If the word \"requires\" already incorporates a duty first to seek debt financing in any refinancing, it would eliminate the reason for the express language in &#167; 3.3.1 which imposes on the partnership, after balance is achieved, an obligation first to seek debt financing before calling on the partners to contribute additional capital.  A contract should be interpreted as a whole, so that each of its provisions has operative effect.  See Bank One Texas, N.A. v. A.J.

IBM essentially argues that the word \"requires\" in &#167; 3.2(c) implicitly imposes a duty to seek debt financing identical to the duty expressly imposed by &#167; 3.3.1.  Such an interpretation does not square with the identical use of the word \"requires\" in &#167; 3.3.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM notes that Exh.  D, &#167; C(13) refers expressly to &#167; 3.3, but not to &#167; 3.2(c).  IBM construes this omission to express an intent to impose the duty to seek third-party debt financing contained in &#167; 3.3 in all refinancing proposals, regardless of whether Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance had been achieved.  Otherwise, IBM argues, Exh.  D., &#167; C(13) would expressly refer to both &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3.  The difficulty with this argument is that it requires us to ignore the text of &#167; 3.3, which expressly applies only \"[a]fter Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance [has been] achieved....\"  Although an express reference to both &#167;&#167; 3.2(c) and 3.3 might have been more artful drafting, the reference to &#167; 3.3 alone is sufficient to lead the reader from &#167; 3.3 to &#167; 3.2(c).  Section 3.3 is applicable only after balance is achieved;  &#167; 3.2(c) explains how the partnership can call for capital contributions before balance is achieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM's next argument for imposing a duty on the partnership to seek outside debt financing is based on the definition of \"Permanent Loan,\" which the Agreement defines as \"such long term financings or refinancings, whether one or more, which are described in Subsection 3.9.2.\"   Agreement &#167; 1.1(50).  This definitional provision is too thin a reed on which to rely, given the statement in Exh.  D, &#167; C(13), governing any proposal for refinancing, that \"the need for capital contributions shall be determined in accordance with Section 3.3 of the Agreement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the definitional provision, &#167; 1.1(50), states that the provisions of &#167; 3.9.2 generally apply to both the initial financing and to any refinancing proposal.  Yet the provisions of &#167; 3.9.2 are drafted with the initial permanent loan in mind, and not all of them make sense as applied to a refinancing.  For example, &#167; 3.9.2 instructs the parties to obtain a loan of at least $75 million, but a refinancing, obtained after some of the principal of the initial loan had been paid and perhaps on more favorable terms, would likely involve a loan for a smaller amount (as it did here).  IBM does not argue that &#167; 3.9.2 imposes an obligation in any refinancing proposal to maintain indebtedness of at least $75 million.  Rather it admits that &#167; 3.9.2 does not apply \"to its full, literal extent\" in the refinancing context, and given that the provision's terms were apparently drafted with the initial permanent loan in mind, we are inclined to agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the question in this case concerns capital contribution obligations, a topic not directly addressed by &#167; 3.9.2.  Exh. D, &#167; C(13) provides expressly that in any refinancing the \"need for additional capital contributions\" is governed by the general provisions of the Agreement concerning such contributions, i.e. &#167; 3.3 and &#167; 3.2(c) (by implicit reference), not by any allegedly different rules created by &#167; 3.9.2.  Therefore, whatever relevance the requirements of &#167; 3.9.2 have to a refinancing plan in general, it is plain that &#167; 3.3, and therefore &#167; 3.2(c), govern the parties' obligations to provide additional capital contributions as part of any refinancing.  Those provisions impose a duty first to seek outside debt financing only after Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance is achieved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM's final objection is that an interpretation which permits the partnership to require an additional capital contribution of up to $17.5 million in any refinancing would render the contract irrational.  Under Massachusetts law, \"a contract should be construed so as to give it effect as a rational business instrument.\"  McMahon v. Monarch Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2093869\"><a href=\"/opinion/2093869/mcmahon-v-monarch-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2093869\"><a href=\"/opinion/2093869/mcmahon-v-monarch-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span>, 830 (1962).  IBM poses various hypothetical scenarios designed to show that allowing Wyman to trigger a large capital contribution obligation, potentially totalling $17.5 million, simply by proposing a refinancing plan renders the deal's reliance on debt financing meaningless.  This, IBM contends, could not represent the reasonable expectations of the parties.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM's parade of horribles ignores the important safeguards against such overreaching which the Agreement itself incorporates.  First, as to the initial financing, &#167; 3.9.2 requires the partnership to seek a loan \"in an amount not less than the greater of (i) $75,000,000 and (ii) 100% of the then current estimate of Total Project Costs....\"  This provision thus requires the partnership to seek an initial loan that is at least large enough to cover all of the partnership's needs, and in no event less than $75 million.  Under &#167; 3.9.2, then, IBM would not be required to make any additional capital contribution at the time of the initial financing plan unless the partnership fell short of its borrowing goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, as to any refinancing plan (in which, as IBM acknowledges, the requirement to maintain the same level of indebtedness would not apply), it is true that IBM could be required to make an additional capital contribution, potentially totaling $17.5 million, so long as Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance had not been achieved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Yet this does not leave IBM without recourse.  Under Exh.  D, &#167; C(13), any refinancing proposal is a \"Major Decision.\"   Although the Agreement does not give IBM the power to veto a refinancing proposal, as it does with some other decisions,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> IBM can demand arbitration of any refinancing proposal under Article XI of the Agreement.  That provision requires a neutral set of arbiters, experienced in the Boston real estate market, to consider the commercial reasonableness of any refinancing proposal.  If Wyman proposed a refinancing plan which was not in the partnership's best interests but was merely a pretext to force IBM to make a capital contribution, then IBM could challenge the refinancing proposal itself before the arbitration panel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These safeguards would prevent Wyman from abusing its power as Managing Partner under &#167; 3.2(c) to call on IBM to make additional capital contributions in any refinancing proposal.  They do not, however, limit the partnership's ability to call on IBM to make additional capital contributions in an otherwise reasonable refinancing plan.  Giving Wyman such authority is not so commercially irrational that it would cause us to question our interpretation of these unqualified and unambiguous provisions requiring IBM to make a capital contribution as part of a commercially reasonable refinancing proposal.  Wyman may well have decided to agree to a partnership in which IBM's initial capital contribution was small only because it had the broad authority under &#167; 3.2(c) to call on IBM to make additional capital contributions that were appropriate for the partnership's needs.  The text of the Agreement makes clear that this authority was not circumscribed by a duty to seek outside debt financing first in any refinancing arrangement.  It is not for the courts to upset the deal that the parties have made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore conclude, as did the district court, that the Agreement's text provides an unambiguous answer to the question the parties have posed in this declaratory judgment action.  In any proposal for refinancing the Partnership debt involving the purchase of the outstanding first mortgage note, the Partnership Agreement requires, unless otherwise requested by the Managing Partner, that IBM first make a capital contribution in an amount necessary to achieve Adjusted Capital Contribution Balance (approximately $17.5 million) and, then, that the Partnership finance the balance needed to refinance the debt in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One final issue remains.  This case was not resolved on cross-motions for summary judgment;  rather, Wyman opposed IBM's motion for summary judgment on the ground that the contract was ambiguous, that discovery was needed to ascertain the true intent of the parties through resort to parol evidence, and that summary judgment was therefore premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The touchstone in our review of the district court's decision to grant Wyman summary judgment sua sponte is whether IBM was afforded appropriate notice and a fair opportunity to present its arguments.  See Berkovitz v. Home Box Office, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196881\"><a href=\"/opinion/196881/berkovitz-v-home-box-office/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.1996).  Sua sponte summary judgment is also appropriate only if the litigation is sufficiently advanced that both parties have had a reasonable opportunity to present any material evidence in their favor.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court had ruled for Wyman on the ground that the agreement was ambiguous and that parol evidence demonstrated that Wyman's position was correct, we would in all likelihood agree with IBM.  As Wyman had argued that more discovery was necessary, such a ruling would have presented serious problems of unfair surprise to IBM, which was entitled to develop parol evidence of its own if it failed to convince the court on its purely textual argument and would have had no opportunity to request additional discovery under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f).  But the district court ruled that the agreement was unambiguous and that it supported Wyman's position.  This court has affirmed the decision of the district court on the same basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM's motion for summary judgment in its favor was premised on a theory that the contract was unambiguous and supported its position.  IBM's own summary judgment motion, in the circumstances of this case, gave IBM ample opportunity to explain its understanding of the contract terms and to set forth its interpretation of the contract's text.  As neither the district court nor this court considered resort to extrinsic evidence necessary, no further discovery was warranted.  We therefore find no error, given the circumstances of this case, in the district court's sua sponte grant of summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We make one final observation.  Both sides have been served well by very able counsel.  Further, the efforts of counsel to resolve this matter, or so much of it as they were able, are to be commended.

As Donoghue makes clear, however, the purpose of allowing such a \"peek\" at extrinsic evidence under some circumstances is merely to ensure that the contract is read \" 'in light of the circumstances of its execution' \" rather than as some hypothetical document existing outside the parties' real business relationship.  Id. at 216 (quoting Robert Indus. v. Spence, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2215427\"><a href=\"/opinion/2215427/robert-industries-inc-v-spence/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">751</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2215427\"><a href=\"/opinion/2215427/robert-industries-inc-v-spence/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span>, 409 (1973))</p>\n        <p>In this case, the circumstances concerning the creation of IBM's and Wyman's ill-fated partnership are clearly laid out in the contract itself and in the several previous opinions addressed to this dispute.  To the extent that Massachusetts permits the limited use of extrinsic evidence in order to shed light on the circumstances of the contract's execution, no such evidence would be helpful in resolving whether the contract terms in this case are ambiguous;  rather, allowing such evidence would simply frustrate the policy of the parol evidence rule.  As a Massachusetts court has observed:</p>\n        <p>Claims of ambiguity ... do not hold the line against summary judgment if the documents do not reflect ambiguity on the point in question....  What a party remembers about what was said at a business conference is easily colored by what that person wished to be resolved by the discussion.  The hoped for result metamorphoses into fact.  That is why lawyers draw commercial instruments to state as precisely as they can the rights and duties of the parties, and that is why the parties sign those agreements.</p>\n        <p>USTrust v.
