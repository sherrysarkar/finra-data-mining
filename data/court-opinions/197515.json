This appeal implicates the\r\n\nconstitutionality of a Massachusetts statute requiring\r\n\nmanufacturers of tobacco products to disclose the additives and\r\n\nnicotine-yield ratings of their products to the state's public\r\n\nhealth department.  See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, S 307B (the\r\n\n\"Disclosure Act\"). Plaintiffs-appellants, various\r\n\nmanufacturers of cigarette and smokeless tobacco products\r\n\n(collectively, \"the manufacturers\"),   appeal the district\r\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants-\r\n\nappellees, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of\r\n\nMassachusetts and the Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner\r\n\n(collectively, the \"Commonwealth\"). The district court ruled\r\n\nthat neither the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising\r\n\nAct, as amended (the \"FCLAA\"), 15 U.S.C. SS 1331-41, nor the\r\n\nComprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986\r\n\n(the \"Smokeless Tobacco Act\"), 15 U.S.C. SS 4401-08, preempts\r\n\nenforcement of the Disclosure Act. We affirm the district\r\n\n1.  The specific plaintiffs-appellants are Philip Morris\r\nIncorporated, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Brown &amp; Williamson\r\nTobacco Corporation, and Lorillard Tobacco Company (\"the\r\ncigarette manufacturers\") [case no. 97-8022], and United States\r\nTobacco Company, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation,\r\nConwood Company, L.P., National Tobacco Company, L.P., The\r\nPinkerton Tobacco Company, and Swisher International, Inc.\r\n(\"the smokeless tobacco manufacturers\") [case no. 97-8023].\r\n\n2.  The specific defendants-appellees are L. Scott Harshbarger,\r\nAttorney General of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and\r\nDavid H. Mulligan, Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health. \r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ncourt's ruling, and hold that the Massachusetts Disclosure Act\r\n\nsurvives the manufacturers' preemption challenge.\r\n\n                             I.\r\n\n                      Prior Proceedings\r\n\n          On August 2, 1996, the day Massachusetts enacted the\r\n\nDisclosure Act, the cigarette manufacturers and smokeless\r\n\ntobacco manufacturers separately filed complaints in the\r\n\ndistrict court claiming that the FCLAA and the Smokeless\r\n\nTobacco Act preempt the state law by operation of the Supremacy\r\n\nClause of the U.S. Constitution. Their complaints also allege\r\n\nthat the Disclosure Act violates the Constitution's Commerce\r\n\nClause, Full Faith and Credit Clause, Fourteenth Amendment Due\r\n\nProcess Clause, and Takings Clause. The parties cross-moved\r\n\nfor summary judgment in each case on the preemption claim\r\n\nonly. After denying the manufacturers' motions and granting\r\n\nthe Commonwealth's motions, the district court amended its\r\n\norders to certify the rulings for immediate appeal.   See 28\r\n\nU.S.C. S 1292(b). We accepted interlocutory review of the\r\n\norders. This appeal, therefore, presents only the preemption\r\n\nissue.\r\n\n3.  Because of the Disclosure Act's extended effective date,\r\nnow November 1, 1997, the district court deferred consideration\r\nof the manufacturers' contemporaneously filed preliminary\r\ninjunction motion.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n                     Standard of Review\r\n\n          We review the district court's summary judgment\r\n\nruling de novo.  Grenier v. Vermont Log Bldgs., Inc., 96 F.3d\r\n\n559, 562 (1st Cir. 1996). The ultimate determination whether\r\n\nfederal law preempts the Massachusetts Disclosure Act presents\r\n\na legal question subject to plenary review.

In so\r\n\ndoing, we consider the statutes' respective texts along with\r\n\nthe relevant historical and legislative contexts in which they\r\n\nwere enacted. See \r                              Wood v. \r                                      General Motors Corp.\r                                                          , 865 F.2d 395,\r\n\n404 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"In determining questions of preemption,\r\n\na court 'must examine the [act's] language against the\r\n\n4.

Guerra, 479\r\n\nU.S. 272, 284 (1987))). Next, we set forth controlling\r\n\npreemption principles. Finally, we turn to the question\r\n\nwhether the federal statutes in question either expressly or\r\n\nimpliedly preempt the state statute. We note here that the\r\n\nSupreme Court's splintered decision in  Cipollone v.  Liggett\r\n\nGroup, \r                   Inc., 505 U.S. 504 (1992) heavily influences, and in\r\n\npart controls, much of our analysis.\r\n\nA.  The Disclosure Act\r\n\n          The Massachusetts Disclosure Act, the first state law\r\n\nof its kind, requires \"any manufacturer of cigarettes, snuff or\r\n\nchewing tobacco sold in the commonwealth\" to provide the\r\n\nMassachusetts Department of Public Health with a yearly report\r\n\nthat lists for each brand of product (1) any added constituents\r\n\n\"in descending order according to weight, measure, or numerical\r\n\ncount,\" and (2) nicotine yield ratings \"which shall accurately\r\n\npredict nicotine intake for average consumers.\" Mass. Gen.\r\n\nLaws ch. 94, S 307B. The Disclosure Act permits public access\r\n\nto the information reported upon an appropriate finding by the\r\n\ndepartment. Specifically, the Disclosure Act provides:\r\n\n          The nicotine yield ratings so provided,\r\n          and any other such information in the\r\n          annual reports with respect to which the\r\n          department determines that there is a\r\n\n5.  See Appendix A for the full text of the Disclosure Act,\r\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, S 307B.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          reasonable scientific basis for concluding\r\n          that the availability of such information\r\n          could reduce risks to public health, shall\r\n          be public records.\r\n\nId.\r\n\n          The public health department may not reveal the\r\n\ninformation, however, \"unless and until the attorney general\r\n\nadvises that such disclosure would not constitute an\r\n\nunconstitutional taking.\"     Id. Despite the apparent\r\n\nlimitations on the public health department's ability to\r\n\ndisclose reported information, the record evidence strongly\r\n\nindicates that Massachusetts officials intend to publicize the\r\n\ninformation. At oral argument before us, the Commonwealth\r\n\navoided direct questions on this issue, asserting that the\r\n\ndepartment's potential publication of the information was\r\n\nirrelevant for the purposes of preemption analysis. For the\r\n\npurposes of this case, we assume that the department will make\r\n\nthe information publicly available at the first legal and\r\n\npractical opportunity.\r\n\n          By all indications, the purpose of the Disclosure Act\r\n\nis to further the public health and education in the use of\r\n\ntobacco products. Most tellingly, the law prefaces its\r\n\nrequirements with the phrase, \"For the purpose of protecting\r\n\nthe public health.\" Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 94, S 307B. In\r\n\naddition, a press release from the Massachusetts Executive\r\n\nDepartment released the same day the law was enacted describes\r\n\nthe Disclosure Act as a \"consumer protection law\" intended to\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nfoster educated decision-making on the part of the consuming\r\n\npublic when choosing specific tobacco products and brands.\r\n\nB.  The Federal Laws\r\n\n          1.  FCLAA\r\n\n          In 1964, the United States Surgeon General's advisory\r\n\ncommittee issued a report that officially acknowledged the\r\n\nhealth hazards of cigarette smoking.  See Cipollone, 505 U.S.\r\n\nat 513. In response, the Federal Trade Commission, as well as\r\n\nseveral states, moved to impose various warning requirements in\r\n\nthe advertising and labeling of cigarettes.    Id.; see  also\r\n\nPalmer v. \r                     Liggett Group, Inc.\r                                        , 825 F.2d 620, 622 n.1 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1987) (noting example of New York State's warning label\r\n\nrequirement). In light of \"the potential maze of conflicting\r\n\nstate regulations\" on the subject, \r                                              Palmer, 825 F.2d at 622, and\r\n\nafter \"vigorous lobbying by all forms of interested groups and\r\n\nbusiness,\" \r                      id. at 623, Congress passed the first version of the\r\n\nFCLAA in 1965 (the \"1965 Act\").\r\n\n          Congress expressly declared its \"policy and purpose\"\r\n\nin passing the 1965 Act:\r\n\n          It is the policy of the Congress, and the\r\n          purpose of this chapter, to establish a\r\n          comprehensive Federal program to deal with\r\n          cigarette labeling and advertising with\r\n          respect to any relationship between\r\n          smoking and health, whereby --\r\n               (1) the public may be adequately\r\n          informed that cigarette smoking may be\r\n          hazardous to health by inclusion of a\r\n          warning to that effect on each package of\r\n          cigarettes; and\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n               (2) commerce and the national\r\n          economy may be (A) protected to the\r\n          maximum extent consistent with this\r\n          declared policy and (B) not impeded by\r\n          diverse, nonuniform, and confusing\r\n          cigarette labeling and advertising\r\n          regulations with respect to any\r\n          relationship between smoking and health.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1331.\r\n\n          The  Cipollone majority determined that the\r\n\ncongressional purposes expressed in this provision were as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n          (1) adequately informing the public that\r\n          cigarette smoking may be hazardous to\r\n          health, and (2) protecting the national\r\n          economy from the burden imposed by\r\n          diverse, nonuniform, and confusing\r\n          cigarette labeling and advertising\r\n          regulations.\r\n\n505 U.S. at 514. The Court explained that the 1965 Act\r\n\ncontained specific provisions \"[i]n furtherance of\" these two\r\n\ncongressional purposes. Id. To further the first purpose, the\r\n\n1965 Act mandated a specific warning label on each cigarette\r\n\npackage: \"CAUTION: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR\r\n\nHEALTH.\"  Id.  To further the second purpose,   see id., the\r\n\nstatute included a preemption provision, which, in part,\r\n\nprohibited the requirement of any \"statement relating to\r\n\nsmoking and health . . . on any cigarette package\" other than\r\n\nthe required warning. 15 U.S.C. S 1334(a). The 1965 Act's\r\n\npreemption clause further provided:\r\n\n6.  At the time, the warning was not required in cigarette\r\nadvertisements.\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                         10\r\r\n\n          (b) No statement relating to smoking and\r\n          health shall be required in the\r\n          advertising of any cigarettes the packages\r\n          of which are labeled in conformity with\r\n          the provisions of this Act.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1334(b) (1966),  amended by 15 U.S.C. S 1334(b)\r\n\n(1969).\r\n\n          By its own terms, the 1965 Act's provisions\r\n\npertaining to advertising were to terminate on July 1, 1969.\r\n\nSee Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 514. As that date approached,\r\n\nvarious federal agencies and states proposed new and differing\r\n\ncigarette advertising regulations.  See id. at 514-15. Faced\r\n\nwith these various initiatives, Congress amended the 1965 Act\r\n\nby enacting the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969\r\n\n(the \"1969 Act\"). The 1969 Act strengthened the wording of the\r\n\nrequired warning label: \"WARNING: THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS\r\n\nDETERMINED THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH.\"\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1333 (1969). The 1969 Act also prohibited\r\n\ncigarette advertising on television and radio and any other\r\n\n\"medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction\r\n\nof the Federal Communications Commission.\" 15 U.S.C. S 1335.\r\n\nRelatedly, the 1969 Act replaced subsection (b) of the 1965\r\n\n7.  For example, the Federal Communications Commission\r\nannounced its intention to consider a proposed rule that would\r\nban radio and television cigarette commercials, while the\r\nCalifornia Senate \"passed a total ban on both print and\r\nelectronic cigarette advertisements.\"  Cipollone, 505 U.S. at\r\n515 &amp; n.11.\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\nAct's preemption provision with the following language, which\r\n\nremains unmodified to this day:\r\n\n          (b) No requirement or prohibition based\r\n          on smoking and health shall be imposed\r\n          under State law with respect to the\r\n          advertising or promotion of any cigarettes\r\n          the packages of which are labeled in\r\n          conformity with the provisions of this\r\n          chapter.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1334(b).\r\n\n          The Senate Report accompanying the 1969 Act explained\r\n\nthat the revised preemption provision was necessary \"to avoid\r\n\nthe chaos created by a multiplicity of conflicting [cigarette\r\n\nadvertising] regulations.\" S. Rep. No. 91-566 (1970),\r\n\nreprinted in 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2652, 2663. Senate Report 566\r\n\nfurther explained:\r\n\n          The State preemption of regulation or\r\n          prohibition with respect to cigarette\r\n          advertising is narrowly phrased to preempt\r\n          only State action based on smoking and\r\n          health. It would in no way affect the\r\n          power of any State or political\r\n          subdivision of any State with respect to\r\n          the taxation or the sale of cigarettes to\r\n          minors, or the prohibition of smoking in\r\n          public buildings, or similar police\r\n          regulations. It is limited entirely to\r\n          State or local requirements or\r\n          prohibitions in the advertising of\r\n          cigarettes.\r\n\nId.\r\n\n8.  In part because the new preemption provision banned\r\nrestrictions imposed only \"under State law,\" in 1972 the\r\nFederal Trade Commission extended the warning requirements to\r\nprint advertisements, as well as package labels.          See\r\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 515.\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\n          After thirteen years of scientific research following\r\n\nthe enactment of the 1969 Act, Congress further amended the\r\n\nFCLAA in 1984.    See H.R. Rep. No. 98-805, at 12 (1984),\r\n\nreprinted  \r                       in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3718, 3725. Renewed\r\n\ncongressional action in this area was in part prompted by\r\n\nSurgeon General reports identifying cigarette smoking as a\r\n\nsignificant risk factor in certain health problems.  See  id.\r\n\n(citing various reports). In light of the Surgeon General's\r\n\nfindings and testimony before congressional committees on the\r\n\nadverse health effects of smoking, Congress passed the\r\n\nComprehensive Smoking Education Act of 1984 (the \"CSEA\").\r\n\nHouse Report 805 states that the CSEA's purpose was \"to assist\r\n\nthe public to make an informed decision about whether or not to\r\n\nsmoke\" \"[b]y updating the cigarette warning, by giving\r\n\nvisibility and emphasis to smoking research and educational\r\n\nactivities at the Federal level, and by working closer with the\r\n\nprivate voluntary health section.\"  Id.\r\n\n          Specifically, the CSEA amended the FCLAA by\r\n\nestablishing a new warning system employing four different\r\n\nsmoking and health messages that would alternate quarterly on\r\n\nboth cigarette packages and cigarette advertisements.  See 15\r\n\nU.S.C. S 1333. To reflect the new multiple-warning system,\r\n\n9.  Specifically, the new required warnings, all preceded by\r\nthe phrase \"SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING,\" are as follows:\r\n\n          Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease,\r\n          Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy.\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                         13\r\r\n\nCongress amended the language in the statute's purpose\r\n\nprovision from \"a warning . . . on each package of cigarettes\r\n\n[that] cigarette smoking may be hazardous to health\" to\r\n\n\"warning notices on each package of cigarettes and in each\r\n\nadvertisement of cigarettes [to inform the public] about any\r\n\nadverse health effects of cigarette smoking.\" S 1331(1);  see\r\n\nalso H.R. Rep. No. 98-805, at 21, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3734.\r\n\n          Significantly, the CSEA inserted an ingredient\r\n\nreporting provision that requires cigarette manufacturers to\r\n\n\"annually provide the Secretary [of Health and Human Services]\r\n\nwith a list of the ingredients added to tobacco in the\r\n\nmanufacture of cigarettes which does not identify the company\r\n\nwhich uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes which\r\n\ncontain the ingredients.\" S 1335a(a). The provision permits,\r\n\nbut does not mandate, \"[a] person or group of persons required\r\n\nto provide [the list] . . . [to] designate an individual or\r\n\nentity to provide the list.\"  Id. In other words, to satisfy\r\n\ntheir respective reporting obligations, the manufacturers at\r\n\ntheir option may submit ingredient lists to a designated agent\r\n\n          Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces\r\n          Serious Risks to Your Health.\r\n\n          Smoking by Pregnant Women May Result in\r\n          Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, and Low\r\n          Birth Weight.\r\n\n          Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1333(a).\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                         14\r\r\n\nwho, in turn, may transmit the information aggregately to the\r\n\nSecretary. Based on the information provided, the Secretary\r\n\nmust transmit a report to Congress, \"[a]t such times as the\r\n\nSecretary considers appropriate,\" on research activities\r\n\nregarding the health effects or risks of cigarette additives\r\n\nand \"any other information which the Secretary determines to be\r\n\nin the public interest.\" S 1335a(b)(1).\r\n\n          The ingredient reporting provision sets forth\r\n\ncomprehensive procedures for the Secretary's handling of the\r\n\ninformation provided. Specifically, S 1335(b)(2)(A) provides:\r\n\n          Any information provided to the Secretary\r\n          under subsection (a) of this section shall\r\n          be treated as trade secret or confidential\r\n          information subject to section 552(b)(4)\r\n          of Title 5 [providing a trade secret\r\n          exemption for disclosure under the Freedom\r\n          of Information Act] and section 1905 of\r\n          Title 18 [criminalizing disclosure of\r\n          confidential information by federal\r\n          officers or employees] and shall not be\r\n          revealed, except as provided in paragraph\r\n          (1) [respecting the Secretary's report to\r\n          Congress], to any person other than those\r\n          authorized by the Secretary in carrying\r\n          out their official duties under this\r\n          section.\r\n\n10.  The legislative history indicates that the ingredient\r\nreporting provision was intended to supply statutory authority\r\nto require the manufacturers to disclose such information and\r\nto \"supercede, in all respects, a voluntary agreement entered\r\ninto between the Department of [Health and Human Services] and\r\nthe tobacco industry in June, 1982.\" H.R. Rep. No. 98-805, at\r\n21, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3734. The House Report further\r\nexplains that the provisions \"would permit the federal\r\ngovernment to initiate the toxicologic research necessary to\r\nmeasure any health risk posed by the addition of additives and\r\nother ingredients to cigarettes during the manufacturing\r\nprocess.\"  Id.\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                         15\r\r\n\nDespite the above-quoted section, a different section directs\r\n\nthat the Secretary may not withhold the ingredient information\r\n\nfrom a requesting congressional committee or subcommittee. \r                                                                      See\r\n\nS 1335a(b)(2)(B).  When faced with such a request, the\r\n\nSecretary must make the list available \"and shall, at the same\r\n\ntime, notify in writing the person who provided the list of\r\n\nsuch request.\"  Id.\r\n\n          Finally, the ingredient reporting provision requires\r\n\nthe Secretary to ensure the confidentiality of the provided\r\n\ninformation through specified procedures, including (1) a\r\n\ndesignated custodian of the information who, when the\r\n\ninformation is not in use, \"shall store it in a locked cabinet\r\n\nor file\" and shall keep a record of those inspecting or using\r\n\nthe information, S 1335a(b)(2)(C), and (2) a requirement that\r\n\npersons \"permitted access to the information shall be\r\n\ninstructed in writing not to disclose the information to anyone\r\n\nwho is not entitled to have access to the information.\" Id.\r\n\n11.  The extent to which members of Congress are bound, if at\r\nall, by the disclosure prohibitions is unclear.\r\n\n12.  It appears, however, that the Secretary's efforts to\r\nnotify the \"person who provided the list\" may be made more\r\ndifficult by S 1335a(a)'s option for such persons to provide\r\nthe list anonymously through a third individual or entity.\r\n\n13.  In addition to amending the FCLAA, the CSEA also directed\r\nthe Secretary to \"establish and carry out a program to inform\r\nthe public of any dangers to human health presented by\r\ncigarette smoking.\" 15 U.S.C. S 1341. Pursuant to that\r\nprogram, the Secretary must, \r                                        inter \r                                             alia, coordinate research on\r\nsmoking and health and disseminate pertinent information to the\r\npublic.  See  id. at S 1341(a). To carry out some of the\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\n          2.  Smokeless Tobacco Act\r\n\n          By the mid-1980's, Congress became concerned that the\r\n\nfederal government's activities regarding the health hazards of\r\n\ncigarette smoking had no parallel with respect to smokeless\r\n\ntobacco products such as chewing tobacco and snuff.   See S.\r\n\nRep. No. 99-209, at 3-4 (1986), \r                                           reprinted \r                                                     in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N.\r\n\n7, 9-10. According to the Senate Report, the almost-forgotten\r\n\nsmokeless tobacco industry had staged a recent resurgence, and\r\n\nits products had become popular among youth who apparently\r\n\nconsidered such products a safe alternative to cigarette\r\n\nsmoking.  See id. Further evidence suggested that smokeless\r\n\ntobacco products contained \"significant levels of nicotine\" and\r\n\nwere linked with serious health problems, including oral\r\n\ncancer. S. Rep. No. 99-209, at 3, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 9.\r\n\nThese factors led to regulatory action on various fronts\r\n\nregarding warning requirements. For example, a Massachusetts\r\n\nexecutive order required warning labels on the packages and in\r\n\nthe advertisements of smokeless tobacco products.         Id.\r\n\nAdditionally, prominent health organizations called for\r\n\nlegislation requiring warnings, and the FTC enlisted the\r\n\nSurgeon General's help in considering a petition seeking\r\n\nprogram's purposes, the CSEA established an Interagency\r\nCommittee on Smoking and Health.  See id. at S 1341(b). The\r\nSecretary also must transmit specified reports to Congress\r\nregarding efforts made to inform the public of the health\r\nhazards of smoking and other information.        See  id. at\r\nS 1341(c).\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                         17\r\r\n\nwarning label requirements.  See S. Rep. No. 99-209, at 4-5,\r\n\n1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 10-11.\r\n\n          In response to such regulatory efforts, Congress\r\n\npassed the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act\r\n\nof 1986 (the \"Smokeless Tobacco Act\"). The Senate Report\r\n\nexplains that the Act, \"for the most part, simply extends the\r\n\nprovisions of . . . the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act of\r\n\n1984, to include smokeless tobacco products.\" S. Rep. No. 99-\r\n\n209, at 5, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 11. Thus, the Smokeless\r\n\nTobacco Act contains features similar, but not identical, to\r\n\nthe FCLAA as amended by the CSEA.\r\n\n          Like the CSEA, the Smokeless Tobacco Act calls for\r\n\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"establish and\r\n\ncarry out a program to inform the public of any dangers to\r\n\nhuman health resulting from the use of smokeless tobacco\r\n\nproducts.\" 15 U.S.C. S 4401. The statute bans the advertising\r\n\nof smokeless tobacco on radio and television,  see 15 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 4402(f), and establishes a rotating warning requirement for\r\n\npackage labels and advertising, with specific warnings\r\n\nregarding the potential adverse health effects of smokeless\r\n\ntobacco products.  See S 4402.\r\n\n14.  The specific texts of the alternative warnings, all\r\npreceded by the word \"WARNING,\" read:\r\n\n          THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE MOUTH CANCER.\r\n\n          THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE GUM DISEASE AND\r\n          TOOTH LOSS.\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\n          Congress included in the Smokeless Tobacco Act an\r\n\nexpress preemption provision which states, in pertinent part:\r\n\n               No statement relating to the use\r\n               of smokeless tobacco products\r\n               and health, other than the\r\n               statements required by [this\r\n               act], shall be required by any\r\n               State or local statute or\r\n               regulation to be included on any\r\n               package or in any advertisement\r\n               . . . of a smokeless tobacco\r\n               product.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 4406(b). Unlike the FCLAA, the Smokeless Tobacco\r\n\nAct contains a \"savings clause,\" which provides: \"Nothing in\r\n\nthis chapter shall relieve any person from liability at common\r\n\nlaw or under State statutory law to any other person.\" 15\r\n\nU.S.C. S 4406(c).  \r\n\n          The Smokeless Tobacco Act similarly provides for\r\n\nanonymous and aggregate ingredient reporting to the Secretary\r\n\n          THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO\r\n          CIGARETTES.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 4402(a)(1).\r\n\n15.  Additionally, the Smokeless Tobacco Act specifically\r\nprecludes any   federal  \r                                     agency from requiring any such\r\nstatements.  See 15 U.S.C. S 4406(a).\r\n\n16.  Senate Report 209 explains that \"the Committee [on Labor\r\nand Human Resources\" wants to emphasize that by including\r\nprovisions in [the Act] which require health warnings on\r\npackages and advertisements for smokeless tobacco products, and\r\nby preempting State and local laws requiring additional health\r\nwarnings, it does not intend to preempt a State's ability to\r\ncontrol the promotion or advertising of tobacco products and\r\ndoes not intend to preempt product liability suits in State or\r\nFederal courts based on failure to warn.\" S. Rep. No. 99-209,\r\nat 14, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 13.\r\n\n                            -19-\r                                         19\r\r\n\nof Health and Human Services. S 4403(a).   Unlike the FCLAA,\r\n\nhowever, the Smokeless Tobacco Act also requires smokeless\r\n\ntobacco manufacturers to specify the nicotine quantity\r\n\ncontained in each product.  Id. The statute's provisions for\r\n\nthe Secretary's handling of the information are essentially\r\n\nidentical to those in the FCLAA, except for the absence of a\r\n\ncross reference to 18 U.S.C. S 1905, which criminalizes\r\n\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  Compare\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1335(b)(2)(A) with 15 U.S.C. S 4403(b)(2). The\r\n\nstatute also requires the Secretary to transmit informative and\r\n\nadvisory reports to Congress.  See 15 U.S.C. S 4407.\r\n\nC.  Preemption Principles\r\n\n          Having reviewed the federal and state statutes at\r\n\nissue in this case, we now consider the preemption principles\r\n\nthat control our analysis of the question whether federal law\r\n\neither explicitly or impliedly preempts the challenged state\r\n\nlaw. We begin by noting that the health and safety of each\r\n\nstate's citizens \"are primarily, and historically, matters of\r\n\nlocal concern.\"   Medtronic v.  Lohr, 116 S. Ct. 2240, 2245\r\n\n(1996). Accordingly, \"the States traditionally have had great\r\n\nlatitude under their police powers to legislate as to the\r\n\n17.  According to the Senate Report, the Smokeless Act's\r\ningredient reporting provision is \"very similar\" to that in the\r\nCSEA and \"is included to further the accumulation of knowledge\r\nabout the health risks of smokeless tobacco use, particularly\r\nthe possible hazards of substances added to tobacco to enhance\r\nflavor and for other purposes.\" S. Rep. No. 99-209, at 14,\r\n1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 13.\r\n\n                            -20-\r                                         20\r\r\n\nprotection of the lives, limbs, health, comfort and quiet of\r\n\nall persons.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks, citations, and\r\n\nalterations omitted). The Massachusetts Disclosure Act\r\n\ncomfortably falls within the \"health and safety\" realm of\r\n\ntraditional state police powers.       Cf.  Wisconsin  Public\r\n\nIntervenor v. Mortier, 501 U.S. 597, 605 (1991) (indicating\r\n\nthat regulation of hazardous pesticides are matters of the\r\n\nstates' \"historic police powers\"); Tart v. Massachusetts, 949\r\n\nF.2d 490, 501 (1st Cir. 1991) (confirming state's \"police\r\n\npower\" to regulate the transshipment of raw fish).\r\n\n          Nevertheless, Article VI of the United States\r\n\nConstitution provides that federal law \"shall be the supreme\r\n\nLaw of the Land; . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of\r\n\nany State to the Contrary notwithstanding.\" U.S. Const. Art.\r\n\nVI, cl. 2. As a result, \"any state law, however clearly within\r\n\na State's acknowledged power, which interferes with or is\r\n\ncontrary to federal law, must yield.\"  Gade v. National Solid\r\n\nWastes Mgmt. Ass'n\r                             , 505 U.S. 88, 108 (1992) (internal quotation\r\n\nmarks and citations omitted). Thus, in this case, we must\r\n\ndetermine whether the Disclosure Act sufficiently interferes\r\n\nwith, and therefore must yield either to the FCLAA or the\r\n\nSmokeless Tobacco Act, or both.\r\n\n          In any preemption analysis, \"[t]he purpose of\r\n\nCongress is the ultimate touchstone.\"  Ingersoll-Rand \r                                                                  Co. v.\r\n\nMcClendon, 498 U.S. 133, 138 (1990) (internal quotation marks\r\n\n                            -21-\r                                         21\r\r\n\nand citations omitted). The Supreme Court recently framed the\r\n\ncrucial inquiry as follows: \"Did Congress, in enacting the\r\n\nFederal Statute, intend to exercise its constitutionally\r\n\ndelegated authority to set aside the laws of a State?\" \r                                                                  Barnett\r\n\nBank v. Nelson, 116 S. Ct. 1103, 1107 (1996). To discern\r\n\nCongress' intent, \"we examine the explicit statutory language\r\n\nand the structure and purpose of the statute.\" Ingersoll-Rand\r\n\nCo., 498 U.S. at 138.\r\n\n          One method by which Congress may evince preemptive\r\n\nintent is through explicit preemption language.  See Jones v.\r\n\nRath Packing Co.\r                           , 430 U.S. 519, 525 (1977). Although Congress\r\n\nneed not employ express preemption language to communicate such\r\n\nintent, \r                   see \r                       International Paper Co.\r                                               v. \r                                                 Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481,\r\n\n492 (1987), when Congress so chooses, our task in divining its\r\n\nintent with respect to the issue at hand may be \"an easy one,\"\r\n\nEnglish v. General Elec. Co., 496 U.S. 72, 79 (1990).\r\n\n          \"More often, explicit pre-emption language does not\r\n\nappear, or does not directly answer the question. In that\r\n\nevent, courts must consider whether the federal statute's\r\n\n'structure and purpose,' or nonspecific statutory language,\r\n\nnonetheless reveal a clear, but implicit, pre-emptive intent.\"\r\n\nBarnett Bank\r                       , 116 S. Ct. 1108 (quoting \r                                                 Jones, 430 U.S. at 525).\r\n\nThus, for example, state law is impliedly preempted to the\r\n\nextent it \"actually conflicts\" with federal law.          See\r\n\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 516. Actual conflict occurs where\r\n\n                            -22-\r                                         22\r\r\n\ncompliance with both state and federal law is a \"physical\r\n\nimpossibility,\" Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul,\r\n\n373 U.S. 132, 143 (1963), or where state law \"stands as an\r\n\nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\r\n\npurposes and objectives of Congress,\" \r                                                 Hines v. \r                                                          Davidowitz, 312\r\n\nU.S. 52, 67 (1941). Additionally, the pervasiveness of a\r\n\nfederal scheme, the dominance of the federal interest, or the\r\n\nfederal goals and obligations may reasonably permit an\r\n\ninference that Congress intended a federal law to \"occupy a\r\n\nfield\" of commerce exclusively, disallowing concurrent state\r\n\noperation or supplementation even where the state law does not\r\n\notherwise \"conflict\" with federal law.  See Rice v. Santa \r                                                                       Fe\r\n\nElevator Corp., 331 U.S. 218, 230 (1947).\r\n\n          Finally, there exists an assumption that federal law\r\n\ndoes not supersede a state's historic police powers \"'unless\r\n\nthat [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.'\"\r\n\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 516 (quoting \r                                              Rice, 331 U.S. at 230); \r                                                                      see\r\n\nHillsborough \r                         County v.

The preemption framework described, while providing a\r\nuseful backdrop for our analysis, does not reflect \"rigidly\r\ndistinct\" preemption categories. English, 496 U.S. at 79 n.5.\r\nFor example, \"field pre-emption may be understood as a species\r\nof conflict pre-emption: A state law that falls within a pre-\r\nempted field conflicts with Congress' intent (either express or\r\nplainly implied) to exclude state regulation.\"  Id.

See \r                                                       Hines, 312 U.S. at\r\n\n67 (explaining that, with respect to preemption analysis, there\r\n\nis no \"rigid formula or rule which can be used as a universal\r\n\npattern to determine the meaning and purpose of every act of\r\n\nCongress\"). Thus, our task requires us to scrutinize the\r\n\nrelevant statutory language, in light of Congress' evident\r\n\npurpose and pertinent case law, to determine whether Congress\r\n\nintended to preempt state laws such as the Disclosure Act.\r\n\n                             IV.\r\n\n                          Analysis\r\n\nA.

S 1334(b).\r\n\n               a.  Cipollone\r\n\n          We begin with    Cipollone, which concerned the\r\n\nviability of state common-law damages actions against cigarette\r\n\nmanufacturers for injuries stemming from the lung-cancer death\r\n\nof Rose Cipollone.    See 505 U.S. 504 (1992). The Court\r\n\nanalyzed the statutory preemption language of both the 1965 and\r\n\n1969 Acts, but because the plaintiffs' claims arose before\r\n\n1984, the Court did not consider the CSEA's potential effect on\r\n\nthose claims.  See id. at 508. In the Court's mixed ruling,\r\n\nJustice Stevens' opinion spoke for a majority of the Court in\r\n\ncertain sections, but largely represented the views of only a\r\n\n                            -26-\r                                         26\r\r\n\nplurality of the Court. The ruling also produced two separate\r\n\nopinions concurring in part and dissenting in part.\r\n\nPrincipally, the Justices disagreed over whether or not state\r\n\ncommon-law damages actions, as opposed to positive enactments\r\n\nby state legislatures or administrative bodies, fell within the\r\n\nscope of the express preemption provisions in the 1965 and 1969\r\n\nActs. While a majority of the Court held that the 1965 Act did\r\n\nnot preempt state common-law damages actions, see  Cipollone,\r\n\n505 U.S. at 518-19, a plurality found that the 1969 Act's\r\n\n\"broader\" preemption language did encompass some common law\r\n\nclaims, see id. at 520-21.\r\n\n          To determine whether or not a particular common law\r\n\nclaim fell within the express preemption clause, the plurality\r\n\nformulated the following \"central inquiry\": \"we ask whether\r\n\nthe legal duty that is the predicate of the common-law damages\r\n\naction constitutes a 'requirement or prohibition based on\r\n\nsmoking and health . . . imposed under State law with respect\r\n\nto . . . advertising and promotion,' giving that clause a fair\r\n\nbut narrow reading.\" Id. at 524. According to the plurality,\r\n\n20.  We acknowledge that the  Cipollone plurality's \"narrow\"\r\nreading of the preemption provision is not without disagreement\r\nby other members of the Court.  See 505 U.S. at 544 (Scalia,\r\nJ., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (stating that\r\npreemption analysis requires the Court \"to interpret Congress's\r\ndecrees of pre-emption neither narrowly nor broadly, but in\r\naccordance with their apparent meaning\"); \r                                                     see \r                                                         also \r                                                              id. at 545,\r\n548 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part)\r\n(explaining that, given the express preemption provision, \"our\r\nresponsibility is to apply to the text ordinary principles of\r\nstatutory construction. . . .

Application\r\n\n               (1) \" Requirement or prohibition . . . imposed\r\n\n               under State law.\"\r\n\n          Although members of the  Cipollone Court disagreed\r\n\nover whether a state common-law damages action could constitute\r\n\na \"requirement\" under S 1334(b), the Court unanimously agreed\r\n\nthat \"positive enactments\" are state-imposed \"requirement[s] or\r\n\nprohibition[s]\" within the meaning of that clause.   See 505\r\n\nU.S. at 521 (plurality opinion); 505 U.S. at 525 (Blackmun, J.,\r\n\nconcurring in part, dissenting in part); 505 U.S. at 548\r\n\n(Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). The\r\n\nDisclosure Act, being a positive enactment by the Massachusetts\r\n\nstate legislature, therefore constitutes a state-imposed\r\n\n\"requirement\" that falls within the universe of state action\r\n\npotentially preempted by the S 1334(b).\r\n\n               (2) \" Based on Smoking and Health\"\r\n\n          We think it clear that the obligations imposed by the\r\n\nDisclosure Act are \"based on smoking and health,\" and the\r\n\nCommonwealth does not dispute this position. The law's stated\r\n\npurpose, \"[f]or the purpose of protecting the public health,\"\r\n\n22.  The Disclosure Act constitutes a \"requirement\" because\r\nunless tobacco product manufacturers comply with its reporting\r\nprovisions, they must forgo selling their products in\r\nMassachusetts.  Cf. Vango Media, Inc. v. City of New York, 34\r\nF.3d 68, 72 (2d Cir. 1994) (finding city ordinance pertaining\r\nto tobacco product advertisements \"plainly is a 'requirement'\"\r\nwithin the meaning of S 1334(b) because absent compliance with\r\nthe ordinance, plaintiff would have to forgo advertising\r\ndisplay).\r\n\n                            -29-\r                                         29\r\r\n\nand the accompanying text strongly imply that its anticipated\r\n\neffect will be greater public awareness about the additives and\r\n\nnicotine in tobacco products and the potential health effects\r\n\nof those ingredients.

While the\r\n\nargument could be made that the Disclosure Act predicates its\r\n\nobligations upon the general duty to follow state statutory\r\n\nreporting requirements rather than state-considerations that\r\n\nare \"based on smoking and health,\" we think such an argument\r\n\nimpermissibly raises the level of generality of the inquiry.\r\n\nThe logical extension of this argument would be that all\r\n\nobligations stemming from state positive-enactments are\r\n\npredicated on the \"general duty\" to \"abide by state law,\" thus\r\n\nbringing every such requirement outside the scope of the\r\n\npreemption clause even if it squarely involved otherwise\r\n\npreempted matters.

At first glance, the Disclosure Act's\r\n\nreporting duties seem entirely unrelated to tobacco industry\r\n\nadvertising and promotion. Certainly, as the district court\r\n\nfound, the compelled furnishing of additive and nicotine-yield\r\n\nlists to state authorities does not itself constitute\r\n\n\"advertising or promotion.\"     Although the cigarette\r\n\n23.  In reviewing the FCLAA as a whole, see Crandon v. United\r\nStates, 494 U.S. 152, 158 (1990), we observe that the specific\r\nreferences to the words \"advertising,\" \"advertisement,\" and the\r\nphrase \"advertising or promotion,\" in context, suggest an\r\ninterpretation of those concepts significantly more traditional\r\nthan furnishing ingredient and nicotine-yield reports to a\r\nstate agency.     See,  e.g., S 1331(1) (referring to the\r\n\"inclusion of warning notices on each package . . . and \r                                                                  in each\r\nadvertisement of cigarettes\" (emphasis added)); S 1333(a)(2)\r\n(\"It shall be unlawful for any manufacturer . . . of cigarettes\r\nto advertise or cause to be advertised . . . any cigarette\r\nunless the advertising bears [a required label]\") (emphasis\r\nadded); S 1333(a)(3) (involving similar requirement for outdoor\r\nbillboard advertisements); S 1335 (making it illegal for\r\nmanufacturers \"to advertise\" on radio and television); S 1336\r\n(acknowledging the Federal Trade Commission's authority in the\r\narea of unfair practices \"in the advertising of cigarettes\")\r\n(emphasis added); S 1337 (requiring the FTC to transmit annual\r\nreports to Congress \"concerning . . . current practices and\r\nmethods of \"cigarette  advertising \r                                               and \r                                                   promotion\") (emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n\n                            -32-\r                                         32\r\r\n\nmanufacturers do not seriously dispute this conclusion, they\r\n\nsubmit that the Disclosure Act's requirements are \"with respect\r\n\nto\" advertising and promotion within the meaning of S 1334(b).\r\n\n            The cigarette manufacturers theorize that the\r\n\nFCLAA, through its mandated warning labels and express\r\n\npreemption language, exclusively delineates the necessary and\r\n\nsufficient health information that cigarette manufacturers may\r\n\nbe compelled to communicate to the public. They contend that\r\n\nsection 1334(b), therefore, in addition to preempting\r\n\nrequirements to change cigarette labels or advertisements,\r\n\nprohibits any additional requirement to communicate to the\r\n\npublic about smoking and health. The manufacturers reason that\r\n\nthe Disclosure Act, although styled as an agency reporting\r\n\nrequirement, essentially compels them to communicate additional\r\n\nsmoking and health information to the public because the health\r\n\ndepartment will make the information publicly available. They\r\n\nassert that S 1334(b) would be rendered meaningless if the\r\n\nCommonwealth may accomplish indirectly what it may not\r\n\naccomplish directly by using the state agency \"as a conduit\"\r\n\nfor the manufacturers' compelled communication. In short, they\r\n\nclaim that the Disclosure Act impermissibly requires them to\r\n\nparticipate in what amounts to a public service advertising\r\n\ncampaign intended to supplement the federally mandated\r\n\nwarnings.\r\n\n                            -33-\r                                         33\r\r\n\n          In  Cipollone, two of the Court's opinions\r\n\nspecifically analyzed the phrase \"with respect to . . .\r\n\nadvertising and promotion\": Justice Stevens' four-vote\r\n\nplurality opinion, which interpreted the phrase narrowly, and\r\n\nJustice Scalia's opinion concurring in part and dissenting in\r\n\npart, in which Justice Thomas joined, which interpreted the\r\n\nphrase more broadly. We note initially that the six Justices\r\n\nrepresented by these two opinions apparently agreed that the\r\n\npreemption clause reached plaintiffs' failure-to-warn claims,\r\n\nat least insofar as they required proof that the manufacturers'\r\n\n\"post-1969 advertising or promotions should have included\r\n\nadditional, or more clearly stated, warnings.\" 505 U.S. at 524\r\n\n(plurality); see id. at 554 (Scalia, J., concurring in part,\r\n\ndissenting in part);   see  also  Palmer, 825 F.2d at 627\r\n\n(explaining that successful failure-to-warn claim effectively\r\n\ncompels manufacturers to alter warning labels).\r\n\n          The four-member plurality further found, however,\r\n\nthat the preemption clause did not bar \"[failure-to-warn]\r\n\nclaims that rely solely on [the cigarette manufacturers']\r\n\ntesting or research practices or other actions  unrelated \r                                                                       to\r\n\nadvertising  \r                        or  \r                            promotion.\"   Cipollone 505 U.S. at 524-25\r\n\n(emphasis added). Moreover, under the plurality's reasoning,\r\n\n24.  Justice Blackmun's concurring and dissenting opinion,\r\njoined by two other Justices, expressed the view that the 1969\r\nAct's preemption clause did not reach state common law claims\r\nat all. Thus, these three Justices expressed no view on the\r\nmeaning of the phrase at issue here.\r\n\n                            -34-\r                                         34\r\r\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation claims survived \"insofar as those\r\n\nclaims rely on a state-law duty to disclose such facts \r                                                                  through\r\n\nchannels of communication other than advertising or promotion\r                                                                       .\"\r\n\nId. at 528 (emphasis added). Significantly, the plurality\r\n\noffered the following by way of illustration: \"Thus, for\r\n\nexample, if state law obliged respondents to disclose material\r\n\nfacts about smoking and health  to \r                                               an \r                                                  administrative \r                                                                  agency,\r\n\n[sec. 1334(b)] would not pre-empt a state-law claim based on a\r\n\nfailure to fulfill that obligation.\"  Id. (emphasis added).\r\n\n          Under the plurality's reasoning, there appears to be\r\n\nlittle doubt that the Disclosure Act is not \"with respect to\"\r\n\nadvertising or promotion because the manufacturers do not\r\n\nsatisfy their obligation to file annual reports to the state\r\n\nhealth department \"through\" an advertising or promotion\r\n\nchannel.   See 505 U.S. at 528 (plurality). The agency's\r\n\npotential release of the information to the public would seem\r\n\nto raise no concern with the plurality, which was not otherwise\r\n\ntroubled about compelled communication to the public through\r\n\nalternative, non-advertising, non-promotional channels (i.e.,\r\n\nin duties underlying certain surviving failure to warn and\r\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation claims), for the purposes of the\r\n\nlanguage at issue. Thus, we believe that the plurality's\r\n\nreasoning militates towards the Commonwealth's position.\r\n\n          Justice Scalia's opinion, concurring in part and\r\n\ndissenting in part, disagreed with the plurality's conclusion\r\n\n                            -35-\r                                         35\r\r\n\nthat a state law claim based on the failure to warn consumers\r\n\n\"'through channels of communication other than advertising or\r\n\npromotion'\" would not come within S 1334(b)'s preemptive scope.\r\n\nId. at 554 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part)\r\n\n(quoting plurality opinion, id. at 528). While acknowledging\r\n\nthat the FCLAA clearly does not preempt claims unrelated to\r\n\nindustry advertising and promotion, Justice Scalia reasoned\r\n\nthat it preempts \"claims based on duties that can be complied\r\n\nwith by taking action    either within the advertising and\r\n\npromotional realm \r                             or elsewhere\r                                         .\"  Id. at 554. Thus, according\r\n\nto Justice Scalia, although a product warning could be\r\n\ncommunicated in many ways, S 1334(b) would preempt the duty as\r\n\na whole because it could be satisfied through advertising or\r\n\npromotion.  See id. at 554-55.\r\n\n          Justice Scalia's opinion also intimated, however,\r\n\nthat a hypothetical law requiring disclosure of product health-\r\n\nhazards to a state public-health agency would bear \"no\r\n\nrelation\" to industry advertising and promotion.  Id. at 554.\r\n\nHe further speculated that such a law \"would seem to survive\"\r\n\na proposed \"practical compulsion\" test to determine the\r\n\n25.  Noting that manufacturers normally communicate required\r\nproduct warnings through advertising and promotion, Justice\r\nScalia found it \"implausible that Congress meant to save\r\ncigarette companies from being compelled to convey such data to\r\nconsumers through that means, only to allow them to be\r\ncompelled to do so through means more onerous still.\"\r\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 555 (Scalia, J., concurring in part,\r\ndissenting in part).\r\n\n                            -36-\r                                         36\r\r\n\nviability of a state law, which he phrased as: \"whether the law\r\n\npractically compels the manufacturers to engage in behavior\r\n\nthat Congress has barred the States from prescribing directly.\"\r\n\nId. at 555 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in\r\n\npart). Justice Scalia's opinion suggests that because the\r\n\nhypothetical law's requirements could not possibly be satisfied\r\n\nthrough advertising and promotional efforts, the law would not\r\n\n\"practically compel\" the manufacturers \"to relinquish the\r\n\nadvertising and promotion immunity accorded them by the Act.\"\r\n\nId. at 555.\r\n\n          In this case, of course, we are presented with an\r\n\nagency reporting requirement coupled with the probability that\r\n\nthe information provided will be made public. Although the\r\n\nhealth department will likely publicize the required reports,\r\n\nthe Disclosure Act does not \"practically compel\" the\r\n\nmanufacturers to communicate smoking and health information to\r\n\nthe public within Justice Scalia's explication because, while\r\n\nthe communicative action to consumers could alternatively be\r\n\nachieved through advertising and promotional efforts, the\r\n\nDisclosure Act itself admits of no such alternative to\r\n\ncompliance. There is no suggestion that the manufacturers\r\n\ncould somehow comply with the Disclosure Act simply by changing\r\n\ntheir advertising or promotional materials. Moreover, direct\r\n\ncommunication of the additive and nicotine-yield information to\r\n\nthe public through some other means would not excuse the\r\n\n                            -37-\r                                         37\r\r\n\nmanufacturers' duties under the law. Thus viewed, the\r\n\nDisclosure Act would survive even Justice Scalia's more\r\n\nexpansive, but distinct minority view of the preemption clause.\r\n\n          While our \r                               Cipollone-based analysis necessarily draws\r\n\nupon the dicta of six Justices who were not presented with an\r\n\nactual agency-reporting scheme, much less a scheme that\r\n\ncontemplates the public release of the information reported, we\r\n\nbelieve that the Justices' observations suggest a qualitative\r\n\ndifference, for S 1334(b) purposes, between direct\r\n\ncommunication with the public and disclosure to a state agency.\r\n\nThe fact that public health agencies exist to serve the public,\r\n\nand the absence of any secrecy mandates in the      Cipollone\r\n\nopinions discussing state agency reporting requirements,\r\n\nfurther suggest that the agency's ultimate use of the\r\n\ninformation does not bear on the question whether such a\r\n\nreporting scheme relates to advertising and promotion. In the\r\n\nend, we believe that \r                                Cipollone weighs strongly in favor of the\r\n\nCommonwealth's position.\r\n\n          In the wake of Cipollone, several courts have dealt\r\n\nspecifically with the question whether a state statute or\r\n\ncommon-law damages action, in various contexts, implicates the\r\n\nphrase, \"with respect to . . . advertising or promotion.\"\r\n\nS 1334(b). In general, the cases yield a broad interpretation\r\n\nof the language at issue. Not surprisingly, therefore, the\r\n\nmanufacturers rely heavily on select language from them.\r\n\n                            -38-\r                                         38\r\r\n\nAlthough none of the cases involves a state-agency reporting\r\n\nscheme, we review them to contextualize the manufacturers'\r\n\narguments and to indicate how the cases differ from the instant\r\n\ndispute.\r\n\n          In \r                        Vango Media, Inc.\r                                          v. \r                                             City of New York\r                                                            , 34 F.3d 68,\r\n\n70 (2d Cir. 1994), the Second Circuit held that the FCLAA\r\n\nexpressly preempted a city ordinance requiring an advertising\r\n\nbusiness to display a minimum of one public health message\r\n\nabout the dangers of smoking (or the benefits of not smoking)\r\n\nfor every four tobacco advertisements. The court reasoned that\r\n\nthe phrase \"with respect to\" in S 1334(b) is essentially\r\n\nsynonymous with \"relating to,\" which, in turn, the Supreme\r\n\nCourt has interpreted broadly.  Id. at 74 (citing definitions\r\n\nsuch as \"referring to\" or \"having a connection with\").\r\n\nAlthough the city ordinance did not require changes in the\r\n\ncontent of tobacco advertisements, the court found that it\r\n\nimpermissibly impacted advertisers and promoters by \"impos[ing]\r\n\nconditions on their display of cigarette advertisements.\" Id.\r\n\nat 75. The court concluded that the city ordinance directly\r\n\ncontravened the FCLAA's purpose of avoiding diverse advertising\r\n\nregulations and \"tread[ed] on the area of tobacco advertising,\r\n\neven if . . . only at the edges.\"  Id. at 74.\r\n\n          In this case, the cigarette manufacturers argue that\r\n\nVango Media\r                       establishes that the FCLAA preempts any attempt to\r\n\nrequire anyone to provide smoking and health messages to the\r\n\n                            -39-\r                                         39\r\r\n\npublic through  any  \r                                media, even media other than industry\r\n\nadvertisements. They argue that the Disclosure Act surely\r\n\ncomes within this vast preempted realm. We do not read  Vango\r\n\nMedia so expansively. In   Vango \r                                             Media, the very display of\r\n\ntobacco advertisements invoked the city ordinance requirements,\r\n\nthus evincing a direct and substantial connection between the\r\n\nordinance and industry advertising.   See id. at 74-75. The\r\n\nDisclosure Act, on the other hand, does not impose conditions\r\n\nupon tobacco advertising or promotional decisions, which are\r\n\nirrelevant to the Disclosure Act's obligations.\r\n\n          Moreover, even assuming (without deciding) that \"with\r\n\nrespect to\" is synonymous with \"relate to,\" the Disclosure Act\r\n\ndoes not \"relate to\" advertising or promotion because it lacks\r\n\nthe requisite \"reference to\" or \"connection with\" the preempted\r\n\nrealm.  See California \r                                   Labor \r                                         Stds. \r                                               Enforcement v.

The Disclosure Act does not make \"reference to\"\r\n\nadvertising and promotion because it does not \"act[]\r\n\nimmediately and exclusively\" upon advertising and promotion,\r\n\nand, unlike the ordinance in \r                                        Vango Media\r                                                  , the existence of such\r\n\nadvertising is not \"essential to the [state] law's operation.\"\r\n\nDillingham Constr.\r                             , 117 S. Ct. at 838. The Disclosure Act does\r\n\n                            -40-\r                                         40\r\r\n\nnot have a \"connection with\" advertising and promotion because\r\n\nit does not mandate the structure and content of advertising,\r\n\nsee id. at 839, and, while it may somehow \"alter[] the\r\n\nincentives\" in advertising decision-making, it \"does not\r\n\ndictate the choices,\" \r                                 id. at 842. Thus, while the ordinance in\r\n\nVango Media\r                       ran afoul of S 1334(b)'s \"with respect to\" language\r\n\nby analogy to the Court's \"relate to\" jurisprudence, the\r\n\nDisclosure Act does not.\r\n\n          Several other cases have involved state claims that\r\n\nsought to impose liability on tobacco product manufacturers for\r\n\nfailing to disclose information to consumers through channels\r\n\nother than traditional advertising or promotion. A few courts\r\n\nhave found general allegations in this regard insufficient to\r\n\nescape S 1334(b)'s preemptive reach. See \r                                                     Cantley v. \r                                                                Lorillard\r\n\nTobacco \r                    Co., 681 So.2d 1057, 1061 (Ala. 1996) (finding bare\r\n\nallegation that cigarette manufacturers concealed material\r\n\nfacts was \"inevitably based upon a state law duty to disclose\r\n\nfacts through advertising or promotion\" because communication\r\n\nwith consumers normally occurs only through those channels\r\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)); Griesenbeck\r\n\nv. American \r                        Tobacco \r                                Co., 897 F.

The court reasoned\r\n\nthat the plaintiff's theory would render the FCLAA\r\n\n\"meaningless\" because it \"suggest[ed] that at the same time\r\n\n[the tobacco manufacturers] were providing the Congressionally-\r\n\nmandated warnings, they were exposing themselves to state law\r\n\ntort liability by failing to use 'non-promotional\r\n\ncommunications' to disseminate material essentially duplicative\r\n\nof the Surgeon General's warning.\"  Id. at 418.\r\n\n                            -42-\r                                         42\r\r\n\n          In yet another case more closely analogous to this\r\n\none, a plaintiff sought an injunction to compel cigarette\r\n\nmanufacturers to disclose to consumers \"the nature, type,\r\n\nextent and identity\" of all cigarette additives.    Lacey v.\r\n\nLorillard Tobacco Co., 956 F. Supp 956, 958 (N.D. Ala. 1997).\r\n\nAfter reviewing the FCLAA's scheme and obligations, the court\r\n\nfound the claim preempted because it was \"based upon an alleged\r\n\nduty . . . to provide to consumers more information regarding\r\n\nsmoking and health than is required by the [FCLAA],\"  id. at\r\n\n963, and because its additional disclosure obligations\r\n\n\"unavoidably attack[ed]\" the manufacturers' advertising and\r\n\npromotion, id. at 962.\r\n\n          Here, we are presented with more than a vague \"tell-\r\n\nthe-consumers-any-way-you-wish\" claim. Cipollone, 505 U.S. at\r\n\n555 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part).\r\n\nSpecifically, the Disclosure Act requires that ingredient\r\n\nreports be filed with a state agency; the reports themselves\r\n\nare plainly outside the realm of advertising or promotion.\r\n\nUnlike plaintiff's theory in Sonnenreich, the Disclosure Act\r\n\ndoes not require the manufacturers to produce materials and\r\n\ndisseminate information to consumers through techniques, such\r\n\n26.  The Lacey court acknowledged the  Cipollone plurality's\r\nsuggestion that the FCLAA would not preempt a state law\r\nrequirement to disclose smoking-and-health facts to an\r\nadministrative agency.  See 956 F. Supp at 962. The court\r\nexplained, however, that the law of the pertinent state\r\n(Alabama) imposed no such obligation.  See id. \r\n\n                            -43-\r                                         43\r\r\n\nas seminars or direct mailings, that resemble promotional\r\n\nefforts and impel the fostering of a product ideology. Unlike\r\n\nthe plaintiff's claim in Lacey, the Disclosure Act does not\r\n\nimpose a duty upon manufacturers to provide additional smoking\r\n\nand health information directly to the public.\r\n\n          There would arguably appear to be little difference\r\n\nbetween requiring manufacturers to disseminate ingredient\r\n\ninformation directly to the public and requiring them to file\r\n\nsuch information with a state agency, which, in turn, will make\r\n\nthe information publicly available. Nevertheless, there is a\r\n\ndifference, and we are unpersuaded by the manufacturers'\r\n\nargument that the difference is not substantively important.\r\n\nMoreover, we find doubtful their expansive interpretation of\r\n\nthe with-respect-to-advertising-and-promotion condition.\r\n\n          While we need not decide the issue now, we are\r\n\nskeptical of the manufacturers' sweeping proposition that the\r\n\nFCLAA prescribes the exclusive means by which they may be\r\n\ncompelled to communicate health information directly to the\r\n\npublic. On this point, we find informative the      Cipollone\r\n\nplurality's preservation of some claims that were based, in\r\n\npart, on the duty to communicate smoking-and-health information\r\n\nto the public.    See 505 U.S. at 524-25 (failure-to-warn\r\n\nclaims); \r                    id. at 528 (fraudulent misrepresentation claims). The\r\n\nsurvival of such claims undermines the premise that the FCLAA\r\n\ndelineates the exclusive scope of consumer-communication\r\n\n                            -44-\r                                         44\r\r\n\nduties, and furthermore suggests the very existence of a subset\r\n\nof such requirements that are wholly unrelated to advertising\r\n\nand promotion. We also find informative the legislative\r\n\nhistory's repeated reference to the \"narrow\" and \"limited\"\r\n\nnature of the preemption provision and declaration that the\r\n\nprovision \"is limited entirely to State or local requirements\r\n\nor prohibitions in the advertising of cigarettes.\" S. Rep. 91-\r\n\n566, 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2663.\r\n\n          Our skepticism aside, significantly, the Disclosure\r\n\nAct does not require the manufacturers to communicate directly\r\n\nwith consumers. Of course, a quintessential state requirement\r\n\n\"with respect to . . . advertising and promotion\" would be a\r\n\nlaw mandating changes or additions to the content of cigarette\r\n\nadvertisements. One step removed from such a law would be a\r\n\nrequirement that manufacturers mass-communicate additional\r\n\nwarnings or other smoking-and-health information directly to\r\n\nconsumers through channels other than advertising or promotion.\r\n\nAt this point, the argument in favor of preemption begins to\r\n\nweaken given the \r                            Cipollone plurality's seemingly narrow concern\r\n\nwith requirements specifically involving advertising and\r\n\npromotional channels.  See 505 U.S. at 524-25, 528. Further\r\n\nremoved yet would be a requirement to disclose such information\r\n\nto some entity other than the consuming public. While one can\r\n\nimagine subsequent intermediate steps, at some point we reach\r\n\nthe agency reporting scheme before us.\r\n\n                            -45-\r                                         45\r\r\n\n          We think that the agency-reporting scheme prescribed\r\n\nunder the Disclosure Act is insufficiently related to the\r\n\nadvertising and promotion realm to bring the state law within\r\n\nS 1334(b)'s preemptive scope. As noted above, the reports\r\n\nrequired under the Disclosure Act do not themselves constitute\r\n\nor resemble promotional material. Once the manufacturers file\r\n\nthe reports with the state public health agency, their\r\n\ncommunicative obligation ceases. They will not be required to\r\n\ndisseminate further the reported information, which becomes\r\n\npublic (if at all), solely through agency action. Thus, unlike\r\n\nan obligation to advise consumers \r                                             directly of any information,\r\n\nwhich may compel the manufacturers to engage in activity\r\n\nresembling advertising and promotional efforts, the Disclosure\r\n\nAct requires no such exertion. In fact, the law separates the\r\n\nnormal source of product advertising and promotion, the tobacco\r\n\nindustry, from any direct communicative action to the public.\r\n\nThat the information contained in the report may eventually\r\n\nbecome widely disseminated does not transform the\r\n\nmanufacturer's initial reporting obligation into an advertising\r\n\nor promotional activity. In our view, an implied\r\n\ntransformation of this sort would distort the language of\r\n\nS 1334(b) beyond Congress' intent. In short, the line between\r\n\n\"with respect to\" and \"no relation to\" advertising and\r\n\npromotion must be crossed at some point, and although we need\r\n\n                            -46-\r                                         46\r\r\n\nnot pinpoint that exact location now, we think it has been\r\n\ncrossed here.\r\n\n          Moreover, we disagree with the manufacturers'\r\n\nargument that the Disclosure Act meets this condition because\r\n\nit reflects the Commonwealth's \"impermissible judgment\" that\r\n\nthe federally-mandated health warnings are inadequate and thus\r\n\nconstitutes an attack upon those warnings. The      Cipollone\r\n\nplurality specifically rejected the proposition that S 1334(b)\r\n\nbroadly preempts any claim that inevitably questions the\r\n\nsuitability of the manufacturers' advertising and promotion\r\n\nactivities. See 505 U.S. at 525 (discussing breach-of-express-\r\n\nwarranty claim). As the plurality stated: \"The appropriate\r\n\ninquiry is not whether a claim challenges the 'propriety' of\r\n\nadvertising and promotion, but whether the claim would require\r\n\nthe imposition under state law of a requirement or prohibition\r\n\nbased on smoking and health with respect to advertising or\r\n\npromotion.\"  Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 525.   This observation\r\n\nindicates that the relevant inquiry focuses not upon any\r\n\nrelation between advertising and the \r                                                motivation behind a state\r\n\n27.

Cir. 1990) (\"Rather than attempt to\r\n\ndivine the Massachusetts Legislature's intent in enacting its\r\n\n. . . legislation, we look instead to the effect of the\r\n\nregulatory scheme.\" (footnote omitted)) (involving express\r\n\npreemption analysis). Thus, the mere suggestion that state\r\n\nlawmakers sought passage of the Disclosure Act in part because\r\n\nof their discontent with federal regulatory efforts does not\r\n\naffect our preemption analysis.\r\n\n          We find, therefore, that the reach of the FCLAA's\r\n\nexpress preemption clause, S 1334(b), does not preclude\r\n\nenforcement of the Disclosure Act. We reach this conclusion\r\n\neven assuming that underlying the state law is discontent with\r\n\nthe federally mandated warnings and the desire to communicate\r\n\nthe additive and nicotine-yield information to the public.\r\n\nLooking to the actual effect of the state law, the Disclosure\r\n\nAct does not require alterations in the industry's advertising\r\n\nand promotional activities, or impose any duty to disclose\r\n\ninformation through those channels. The state law's\r\n\nobligations are neither triggered by advertising decisions, nor\r\n\ncould they be fulfilled by altering cigarette labels or\r\n\nadvertisements. The law does not direct the manufacturers to\r\n\nemploy any mass-marketing or other techniques even remotely\r\n\nresembling advertising and promotion. In the end, we think\r\n\n                            -48-\r                                         48\r\r\n\nthat had Congress intended to prohibit the public disclosure of\r\n\nsmoking and health information that, at some point, the\r\n\ntobacco-product manufacturers had disgorged under state law,\r\n\nthe limited phrase \"with respect to advertising and promotion\"\r\n\nwould be an odd vehicle to reach this end. Thus, we find the\r\n\nexplicit preemption language and legislative history\r\n\ninsufficient to \"clear[ly] and manifest[ly]\" overcome the\r\n\npresumption against preemption of a state's traditional powers\r\n\nto legislate for the health and safety of its citizens.\r\n\nMortier, 510 U.S. at 606; \r                                     see \r                                        Dillingham Constr.\r                                                          , 117 S. Ct. at\r\n\n842 (\"We could not hold pre-empted a state law in an area of\r\n\ntraditional state regulation based on so tenuous a relation\r\n\nwithout doing grave violence to our presumption that Congress\r\n\nintended nothing of the sort.\") (construing express preemption\r\n\nlanguage).\r\n\n          2.  Smokeless Tobacco Act\r\n\n          Our inquiry into the scope of the Smokeless Tobacco\r\n\nAct's preemption clause is considerably simpler than the\r\n\npreceding analysis. The Smokeless Tobacco Act provides that\r\n\n          No statement relating to the use of\r\n          smokeless tobacco products and health,\r\n          other than the statements required by\r\n          [this act], shall be required by any State\r\n\n28.  The manufacturers do not argue that the 1984 amendments to\r\nthe FCLAA wrought by the CSEA in any manner changed or affected\r\nthe meaning of the express preemption clause, last amended in\r\n1969. Thus, we do not address the question whether the\r\ningredient reporting requirements or other amendments affect\r\nthe express preemption analysis.\r\n\n                            -49-\r                                         49\r\r\n\n          or local statute or regulation to be\r\n          included  on  \r                                    any  \r                                          package or   in  \r                                                            any\r\n          advertisement (unless the advertisement is\r\n          an outdoor billboard advertisement) of a\r\n          smokeless tobacco product.]\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 4406(b) (emphasis added).\r\n\n          We find dispositive the phrases \"\r                                                      on any package\" and\r\n\n\"in any advertisement,\" which differ significantly from the\r\n\nbroader \"with respect to\" language in the FCLAA's preemption\r\n\nprovision.   Cf.  Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 520 (plurality)\r\n\n(explaining that the clause, \"\r                                         with respect to\r                                                        . . . advertising\r\n\nand promotion,\" in the 1969 Act was notably broader than its\r\n\npredecessor, \"\r                         in the advertising,\" in the 1965 Act); \r                                                               id. at 554\r\n\n(Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part)\r\n\n(suggesting same). Because the Disclosure Act only requires\r\n\nthe manufacturers to file certain reports to the Massachusetts\r\n\nDepartment of Public Health, plainly it does not require a\r\n\n\"statement\" of any kind \"to be included on any package or in\r\n\nany advertisement.\"     Cf.  id. at 518 (majority opinion)\r\n\n(explaining that similar language in 1965 Act \"merely\r\n\nprohibited . . . particular cautionary statements on cigarette\r\n\nlabels . . . or in cigarette advertisements\"). The Smokeless\r\n\nTobacco Act's express preemption clause, therefore, does not\r\n\ninvalidate the Disclosure Act.\r\n\n29.  For the reasons stated in our FCLAA express preemption\r\nanalysis, we reject the manufacturers' argument that the\r\npublicizing of the ingredient lists effectively transforms the\r\nlists into an \"advertisement\" within the meaning of S 4406(b).\r\n\n                            -50-\r                                         50\r\r\n\n           We observe that our holding is wholly consistent\r\n\nwith the Smokeless Tobacco Act's \"savings clause\" which\r\n\npreserves, \r                      inter \r                            alia, state common-law failure to warn claims.\r\n\nSee 15 U.S.C. S 4406(c); S. Rep. No. 99-209, at 14, 1986\r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 13 (also stating that Smokeless Tobacco Act is\r\n\nnot intended \"to preempt a State's ability to control the\r\n\npromotion or advertising of tobacco products\"). If claims\r\n\ndirectly attacking the adequacy of package labeling and\r\n\nadvertising survive the Smokeless Tobacco Act's express\r\n\npreemption clause, then the reporting obligations under the\r\n\nDisclosure Act surely survive as well.\r\n\n          We conclude that neither the FCLAA nor the Smokeless\r\n\nTobacco Act expressly preempts the Massachusetts Disclosure\r\n\nAct.\r\n\nB.  Implied Preemption\r\n\n          1.  A Proper Inquiry?\r\n\n          Before we turn to the manufacturers' implied pre-\r\n\nemption arguments, we first address the Commonwealth's\r\n\ncontention that Cipollone precludes any preemption analysis\r\n\nbeyond the scope of the express preemption clause. In\r\n\nCipollone, the Court held that \"the pre-emptive scope of the\r\n\n1965 Act and the 1969 Act is governed entirely by the express\r\n\n[preemption] language in . . . each Act\" and explained that\r\n\n\"Congress' enactment of a provision defining the pre-emptive\r\n\nreach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are\r\n\n                            -51-\r                                         51\r\r\n\nnot pre-empted.\" 505 U.S. at 517. The Court further stated:\r\n\n\"In this case, the other provisions of the 1965 and 1969 Acts\r\n\noffer no cause to look beyond [the express preemption\r\n\nprovision] of each Act. Therefore, we need only identify the\r\n\ndomain expressly pre-empted by each of those sections.\" \r                                                                   Id. at\r\n\n517.\r\n\n          Subsequent to  Cipollone, the Court clarified the\r\n\nappropriate approach to implied preemption issues in cases in\r\n\nwhich express preemption language exists. In     Freightliner\r\n\nCorp. v. \r                    Myrick, 115 S. Ct. 1483 (1995), the Court acknowledged\r\n\nCipollone's holding \"that the pre-emptive scope of the two\r\n\nstatutes at issue was governed by the language in each act,\"\r\n\nid. at 1487, but further explained that \"[t]he fact that an\r\n\nexpress definition of the pre-emptive reach of a statute\r\n\n'implies' -- i.e., supports a reasonable inference -- that\r\n\nCongress did not intend to pre-empt other matters does not mean\r\n\nthat the express clause entirely forecloses any possibility of\r\n\nimplied pre-emption,\" \r                                 id. at 1488. Thus, the Court concluded,\r\n\n\"[a]t best, Cipollone supports an inference that an express\r\n\npre-emption clause forecloses implied pre-emption; it does not\r\n\nestablish a rule.\"  Id. at 1488.\r\n\n          In this case, the manufacturers' implied preemption\r\n\narguments are largely based on the ingredient reporting\r\n\nprovisions added to the FCLAA by the CSEA in 1984, which were\r\n\nnot at issue in Cipollone.  See 505 U.S. at 508. Thus, the\r\n\n                            -52-\r                                         52\r\r\n\nCipollone Court's refusal to look beyond the express preemption\r\n\nclauses for the purposes of analysis under the 1965 and  1969\r\n\nActs does not per se foreclose an implied preemption analysis\r\n\nbased on the 1984 amendments. Thus, while we might be tempted\r\n\nto end our preemption analysis here, we feel compelled to\r\n\nexplore the manufacturers' implied preemption theories.\r\n\n          We are bound, however, by the Cipollone majority's\r\n\nholding that S 1334(b) governs the preemptive scope of the 1965\r\n\nand 1969 Acts. Having found that the Disclosure Act falls\r\n\noutside the domain of S 1334(b), we engage in an implied\r\n\npreemption analysis only to the extent it relies on the\r\n\namendments wrought by the CSEA in 1984. In other words, we are\r\n\nnot at liberty to address any implied preemption theories based\r\n\nsolely on the FCLAA in its 1965 or 1969 versions, independent\r\n\nof the CSEA. Moreover, given that a majority of the Court has\r\n\nindicated that the FCLAA's express preemption clause implies\r\n\nthat matters outside its scope are not preempted,         see\r\n\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 517, it becomes apparent that any\r\n\nattempt to surmount the presumption against preemption of the\r\n\nstate's historic police powers under an implied preemption\r\n\ntheory faces a considerable obstacle.  See Snow, 898 F.2d at\r\n\n282 (\"The burden of overcoming th[e] presumption in favor of\r\n\nstate law is heavy in those cases that rely on implied\r\n\npreemption, which rests in turn on inference\" (internal\r\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted)).\r\n\n                            -53-\r                                         53\r\r\n\n          2.  Manufacturers' Arguments\r\n\n          As detailed above, both the FCLAA and Smokeless\r\n\nTobacco Act direct tobacco-product manufacturers to provide to\r\n\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services an annual\r\n\ningredients list which does not identify the manufacturer or\r\n\nthe brand represented by the list, information which may be\r\n\nsubmitted aggregately by more than one manufacturer through an\r\n\nagent.   See 15 U.S.C. SS 1335a(a), 4403(a). Under both\r\n\nstatutes, the information provided is \"treated as a trade\r\n\nsecret or confidential information,\" and its unauthorized\r\n\ndisclosure is forbidden.            See SS 1335a(b)(2)(A),\r\n\n4403(b)(2)(A).  The laws further require the Secretary to\r\n\nestablish written procedures by which the information will be\r\n\nsafeguarded and specifically mandates that those procedures\r\n\ninclude certain custodial, storing, and access arrangements.\r\n\nSee SS 1335a(b)(2)(C), 4403(b)(2)(C). The manufacturers\r\n\ncontend that the Disclosure Act is impliedly preempted in light\r\n\nof these provisions combined with the structure and purpose of\r\n\nthe statutes.\r\n\n          The manufacturers do not rely, nor could they rely,\r\n\non the theory that compliance with both the Disclosure Act and\r\n\nfederal law presents a \"physical impossibility.\"  See Florida\r\n\n30.  The FCLAA additionally makes such disclosure a felony by\r\nexplicit reference to 18 U.S.C. S 1905, which criminalizes\r\nunauthorized disclosure of trade secret or confidential\r\ninformation by federal officers or employees.  See 15 U.S.C.\r\nS 1335a(b)(2)(A).\r\n\n                            -54-\r                                         54\r\r\n\nLime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc.\r                                        v. \r                                          Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 143 (1963).\r\n\nRather, they contend that the Disclosure Act impermissibly\r\n\nconflicts with the purpose and objectives that underlie the\r\n\nfederal statutes. They further contend, albeit less\r\n\nelaborately, that the state law invades a field of commerce for\r\n\nwhich Congress intended exclusive federal regulation.\r\n\n          Specifically, the manufacturers argue that through\r\n\nthe FCLAA and the Smokeless Tobacco Act, Congress intended to\r\n\nestablish a careful balance between two national interests: (1)\r\n\neducating the public about the use of tobacco products and\r\n\nhealth and (2) limiting commercial burdens on the tobacco\r\n\nindustry. The ingredient reporting and safeguarding\r\n\nprovisions, they contend, further these purposes in a unique\r\n\nand exclusive manner. They reason that, while the required\r\n\ningredient lists allow Congress, with the assistance of the\r\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and its\r\n\nresearch efforts, to determine the continued adequacy of the\r\n\nmandated warning labels, nonetheless the information provided\r\n\nis kept in strict confidence through elaborate statutory\r\n\nprotections. These comprehensive provisions, the manufacturers\r\n\nclaim, limit the impact upon commerce associated with reporting\r\n\nand evaluating ingredient information.\r\n\n          The manufacturers assert that, by prescribing both an\r\n\nanonymous form of ingredient disclosure and strict safekeeping\r\n\nof the information provided, Congress intended to avoid\r\n\n                            -55-\r                                         55\r\r\n\n\"unnecessary invasion of company-specific and brand-specific\r\n\ntrade secret information.\" They contend that Congress could\r\n\nhave required full ingredient disclosure on all product labels,\r\n\nor, at the other extreme, no disclosure whatever. Instead, it\r\n\nchose a specific intermediate position which represents a\r\n\n\"precisely calibrated balance\" that, in Congress' judgment,\r\n\nbest served the public.\r\n\n          The manufacturers further contend that the anonymity\r\n\nprovided them when submitting the ingredient lists indicates\r\n\nthat the additional provisions protecting the confidentiality\r\n\nof the collected information are not merely matters of\r\n\n\"custody\" or \"internal housekeeping.\" While conceding that the\r\n\nfederal statutes do not grant the information \"trade secret\r\n\nstatus\" per se, the manufacturers nonetheless argue that, for\r\n\npreemption purposes, the exacting confidentiality provisions\r\n\nreflect Congress' concern for the potential loss of commercial\r\n\nadvantage, which itself is part and parcel of Congress' broader\r\n\nintent to protect commerce and the national economy.\r\n\n          According to the manufacturers, enforcement of the\r\n\nDisclosure Act's obligations to disclose brand-specific and\r\n\ncompany-specific ingredient information, without guarantees of\r\n\nconfidentiality, would frustrate the purposes of the FCLAA and\r\n\nSmokeless Tobacco Act. They contend that the federal statutes'\r\n\nintricate information-safekeeping provisions \"would be utterly\r\n\npointless\" if a state were permitted to make publicly available\r\n\n                            -56-\r                                         56\r\r\n\ninformation that the federal government may not even collect,\r\n\nmuch less reveal. Moreover, they claim, it would be \"absurd\"\r\n\nfor the HHS Secretary to continue to collect the federally\r\n\nprescribed ingredient information when even more precise, brand\r\n\nspecific information collected pursuant to the Disclosure Act\r\n\nwould be readily available. Because Congress carefully limited\r\n\nthe collection and disclosure of cigarette ingredients in\r\n\nfurtherance of the balance between health education and trade\r\n\nprotection, they argue, collection and disclosure of the type\r\n\ncontemplated by the Disclosure Act would \"stand[] as an\r\n\nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\r\n\npurposes and objectives of Congress.\" \r                                                 Hines v. \r                                                          Davidowitz, 312\r\n\nU.S. 52, 67 (1941). They further assert that the comprehensive\r\n\nmanner in which Congress dealt with the health concern posed by\r\n\ntobacco-product additives shows its intent to obtain uniformity\r\n\nin ingredient disclosure requirements, supplanting any\r\n\nsupplemental state efforts, such as the Disclosure Act, in the\r\n\narea.\r\n\n          The manufacturers also offer a closely related\r\n\nargument: the Disclosure Act intrudes into a \"field,\" albeit a\r\n\nnarrow one, that Congress intended federal law to occupy\r\n\nexclusively. To this end, they assert that the HHS Secretary's\r\n\nrole to review cigarette ingredients from a health standpoint,\r\n\nthe stringent confidentiality procedures, and the balance of\r\n\nnational interests \"evince Congress' intent to occupy the field\r\n\n                            -57-\r                                         57\r\r\n\nof cigarette ingredient reporting, monitoring and review.\" In\r\n\nsum, they argue that the very comprehensiveness, complexity,\r\n\nand specificity of the federal reporting provisions evince a\r\n\nfederal dominance and pervasiveness in ingredient reporting and\r\n\ndisclosure that allows no room for supplemental state laws such\r\n\nas the Disclosure Act. Ultimately, we find the manufacturers'\r\n\narguments unpersuasive.\r\n\n          3.

The manufacturers' implied preemption\r\n\narguments essentially identify into two purported \"special\r\n\nfeatures\" in the federal statutes warranting preemption: (1) an\r\n\nasserted \"balance of national interests\" effected by the FCLAA\r\n\nand Smokeless Tobacco Act, and (2) the detailed and stringent\r\n\nstatutory provisions for confidential reporting and protection\r\n\nof ingredient information.\r\n\n               a.  Balance of National Interests?\r\n\n          As indicated above, the FCLAA contains explicit\r\n\nlanguage setting forth its policy and purpose:\r\n\n          It is the policy of the Congress, and the\r\n          purpose of this chapter, to establish a\r\n          comprehensive Federal program to deal with\r\n          cigarette labeling and advertising with\r\n          respect to any relationship between\r\n          smoking and health, whereby --\r\n               (1) the public may be adequately\r\n          informed about any adverse health effects\r\n          of cigarette smoking by inclusion of\r\n          warning notices on each package of\r\n          cigarettes; and\r\n               (2) commerce and the national\r\n          economy may be (A) protected to the\r\n          maximum extent consistent with this\r\n          declared policy and (B) not impeded by\r\n          diverse, nonuniform, and confusing\r\n          cigarette labeling and advertising\r\n          regulations with respect to any\r\n          relationship between smoking and health.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1331.\r\n\n31.  Although the Smokeless Tobacco Act does not contain a\r\nS 1331 counterpart, the smokeless tobacco manufacturers seek to\r\navail themselves of arguments related to this section because\r\n\n                            -59-\r                                         59\r\r\n\n          The manufacturers' implied preemption arguments rely\r\n\nheavily on select phrases from S 1331 and on certain language\r\n\nin our pre-Cipollone decision, Palmer v. Liggett Group, Inc.,\r\n\nin which we held that the FCLAA impliedly preempted state\r\n\ncommon-law causes of action based on failure-to-warn theories.\r\n\nSee 825 F.2d at 626. In   Palmer, we expansively interpreted\r\n\nS 1331 and declared that, in passing the FCLAA, Congress sought\r\n\n\"to strike a fair, effective balance between . . . two\r\n\ncompeting interests\": \"health protection (through education)\r\n\nand trade protection.\" Id. at 626. We observed, \"Congress ran\r\n\na hard-fought, bitterly partisan battle in striking the\r\n\ncompromise that became the [FCLAA]. It is inconceivable that\r\n\nCongress intended to have that carefully wrought balance of\r\n\nnational interests superseded by the views of a single state .\r\n\n. . .\"  Id. We further quoted favorably the Third Circuit's\r\n\nassertion in \r                        Cipollone, prior to Supreme Court review, that the\r\n\nFCLAA \"'presents a carefully drawn balance between the purposes\r\n\nof warning the public of the hazards of cigarette smoking and\r\n\nprotecting the interests of [the] national economy.'\"     Id.\r\n\n(quoting Cipollone v.

It now appears, however,\r\n\nof the similar substantive provisions in the two statutes.\r\nBecause a statute's substantive provisions carry out its\r\npurpose, they argue, Congress must have intended the same\r\npolices and purposes to animate the two statutes. For the sake\r\nof argument, we accept their contention that the same pertinent\r\npurposes animate the two statutes.\r\n\n                            -60-\r                                         60\r\r\n\nthat in Palmer we overstated Congress' purposes evinced in\r\n\nS 1331.\r\n\n          On review of the Third Circuit's \r                                                     Cipollone opinions,\r\n\nthe Supreme Court acknowledged the S 1331-based \"protection of\r\n\nnational economy\" theory, quoting the same phrase we quoted in\r\n\nPalmer when reviewing the prior proceedings of the case.  See\r\n\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 511.  None of the court's opinions,\r\n\nhowever, either affirmed or elaborated upon this theory.\r\n\nRather, a majority of the Court agreed that the two purposes\r\n\nexpressed in S 1331 were \"(1) adequately informing the public\r\n\n[of any adverse health effects of smoking\r                                                    ], and (2) protecting\r\n\nthe national economy  from  \r                                        the  \r                                             burden  \r                                                    imposed  \r                                                             by  \r                                                                 diverse,\r\n\nnonuniform, \r                        and \r                            confusing \r                                      cigarette \r                                                labeling \r                                                         and \r                                                              advertising\r\n\nregulations.\" 505 U.S. at 514 (emphasis added). Therefore,\r\n\nwhen faced squarely with the opportunity, the majority\r\n\nrecognized neither a statutory purpose to protect the tobacco\r\n\nindustry from all state-imposed commercial burdens, nor some\r\n\n32.  The Third Circuit produced a number of published opinions\r\nfor the Cipollone case. Although the Supreme Court discussed\r\nthe Court of Appeals' opinion published at 789 F.2d 181 (1986),\r\nit accepted review of the case published at 893 F.2d 541\r\n(1990).\r\n\n33.  The Court also cited   Palmer as an example of a case\r\nfollowing the Third Circuit's analysis in Cipollone, 789 F.2d\r\n181.  See Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 508 n.2.\r\n\n34.  We modify the Court's language here in light of the 1984\r\namendment to S 1331(1) reflecting the new rotating warning\r\nsystem. \r\n\n                            -61-\r                                         61\r\r\n\noverarching \"balance\" from which an expansive domain of\r\n\npreemption might flow.\r\n\n          The Court's evident rejection of the lower court's\r\n\n\"balance of national interests theory\" is reflected in the\r\n\nCourt's refusal to engage in an implied preemption analysis\r\n\neven as to those claims not expressly preempted. Had the Court\r\n\nbeen inclined to recognize and give preemptive effect to the\r\n\nasserted balance, it might have found preempted the surviving\r\n\nfailure-to-warn and fraudulent misrepresentation claims which,\r\n\nif successful, would certainly inflict a burden upon the\r\n\ntobacco trade. Instead, the Court recognized the limited\r\n\npurpose of avoiding the burden on the national economy\r\n\nspecifically posed by nonuniform labeling and advertising\r\n\nregulations.  Moreover, the Court indicated that Congress\r\n\n35.  As indicated earlier, the \r                                          Cipollone Court did not address\r\nthe CSEA and its amendments to the FCLAA. We see no reason,\r\nhowever, why the CSEA would change the Court's interpretation\r\nof the text of S 1331(2), which has never been amended,\r\nregarding the nature of the burden to the national economy\r\nsought to be avoided under the FCLAA. While the CSEA\r\nnecessarily furthers the congressional purposes expressed in\r\nS 1331, nothing in the 1984 amendments suggests that it alters\r\nthe scope of the protected interest expressed in S 1331(2), as\r\ninterpreted by the Court in Cipollone.\r\n\n36.  At this point, we will not speculate as to the nature and\r\ncharacter of the burden created should other states impose\r\ndiffering reporting requirements.  See English 496 U.S. at 90\r\n(finding certain imagined prospects \"simply too speculative a\r\nbasis on which to rest a finding of pre-emption\"). Although\r\nthe cigarette manufacturers cite dozens of pending tobacco-\r\ndisclosure bills in state legislatures, even if we assume the\r\nbills will become law, see Minn. H.F. 117 S 5, the resulting\r\nburden is qualitatively different, and seemingly significantly\r\nlesser, than that created by varying warning requirements in\r\n\n                            -62-\r                                         62\r\r\n\naddressed this concern largely, if not solely, through the\r\n\nexpress preemption clause, which we have addressed above. See\r\n\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 514; see also S. Rep. No. 91-566, 1970\r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 2663 (explaining that preemption clause was\r\n\nnecessary \"to avoid the chaos created by a multiplicity of\r\n\nconflicting [cigarette advertising] regulations\").\r\n\n          We cannot ignore the \r                                          Cipollone majority's reading of\r\n\nthe congressional purpose evinced in S 1331, which is\r\n\nconsiderably more limited than our enunciation in Palmer and\r\n\nthe manufacturers' current contentions. Given the Court's\r\n\nnarrower interpretation, we conclude that the Disclosure Act\r\n\ndoes not impede either purpose expressed in S 1331 because it\r\n\nneither obstructs the congressionally mandated warning labels,\r\n\nnor (for the reasons expressed previously) impedes the national\r\n\neconomy by imposing a diverse or nonuniform advertising\r\n\nregulation. Although S 1331 may express some general concern\r\n\nfor protecting commerce and the national economy, we will not\r\n\nfind preemption where a state law merely creates some general\r\n\ntension with a federal law's abstract objectives.         See\r\n\nCommonwealth Edison Co.\r                                   v. \r                                      Montana, 453 U.S. 609, 633-34 (1981)\r\n\n(finding no \"congressional intent to pre-empt all state\r\n\nlegislation that may have an adverse impact on the use of coal\"\r\n\ndespite general national policy to encourage use of coal);\r\n\nthe production of labels and advertising for each product and\r\nbrand.\r\n\n                            -63-\r                                         63\r\r\n\nLaurence H.

Indeed, had Congress intended to protect\r\n\nthe tobacco industry from negative state action generally, then\r\n\nsurviving police regulations, such as prohibitions on smoking\r\n\nin public buildings or on tobacco use by minors, or state\r\n\ntaxation, would also be preempted.  See S. Rep. 91-566, 1970\r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 2663.\r\n\n          Having found that the purported general national\r\n\npolicy does not yield a special statutory feature that warrants\r\n\npreemption, we turn to specific statutory provisions with which\r\n\nthe Disclosure Act allegedly conflicts. Cf. \r                                                        Montana, 453 U.S.\r\n\nat 634.\r\n\n               b. Conflict with Federal Reporting Provisions?\r\n\n          The manufacturers contend that the Disclosure Act\r\n\nconflicts with, and effectively \"repeals,\" Congress' carefully\r\n\nwrought ingredient reporting scheme. They argue that the\r\n\nfederal anonymity and confidentiality protections show\r\n\ncongressional intent to oust state laws such as the Disclosure\r\n\nAct, which demand product-specific and brand-specific\r\n\ninformation without protection of confidentiality. Normally,\r\n\nhowever, state laws are not preempted \"'solely because they\r\n\nimpose liability over and above that authorized by federal\r\n\nlaw.'\" English, 496 U.S. at 89 (quoting \r                                                    California v. \r                                                                  ARC Am.\r\n\nCorp., 490 U.S. 93, 105 (1989)). Rather, we must find \"some\r\n\nspecific suggestion in the text or legislative history\" of the\r\n\n                            -64-\r                                         64\r\r\n\nallegedly preempting federal law to conclude that Congress\r\n\nintended to preempt additional state liabilities.  Id.\r\n\n          On their face, the FCLAA and Smokeless Tobacco Act do\r\n\nnot protect generally the confidentiality of tobacco-industry\r\n\ningredient information. Rather, they secure only \"information\r\n\nprovided to the Secretary under [the reporting provisions].\"\r\n\n15 U.S.C. SS 1335a(b)(2)(A), 4403(b)(2)(A). By like token, the\r\n\nprovisions mandating the Secretary to establish confidentiality\r\n\nprocedures, while notable for their specificity, apply only to\r\n\nthe information provided to her under the statutes.       See\r\n\nSS 1335a(b)(2)(C), 4403(b)(2)(C). Furthermore, as the\r\n\nmanufacturers concede, the statutes do not confer \"trade\r\n\nsecret\" or \"confidential\" status upon the information, but only\r\n\n\"treat[]\" it as such.  Id.\r\n\n          While the statutes strictly forbid unauthorized\r\n\ndisclosure, the proscriptions govern the conduct of only\r\n\ncertain federal officers or employees. For example, the laws\r\n\nbestow upon the collected information the benefit of the trade\r\n\nsecrets exemption in the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\").\r\n\nSee 5 U.S.C. S 552(b)(4). The FOIA, however, by its own terms,\r\n\napplies only to federal executive branch agencies.     See 5\r\n\nU.S.C. SS 551(1), 552(a). Thus, HHS employees and other\r\n\nfederal employees need not make publicly available the\r\n\n37.  The proscriptions against disclosure are subject to any\r\nrequest by a congressional committee or subcommittee.  See 15\r\nU.S.C. SS 1335a(b)(2)(B), 4403(b)(2)(B).\r\n\n                            -65-\r                                         65\r\r\n\ncollected information under the FOIA, but the exemption would\r\n\nnot inhibit the conduct of state agencies possessing such\r\n\ninformation, which are not governed by the FOIA in the first\r\n\ninstance. The FCLAA further indicates Congress' strong intent\r\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of the collected information by\r\n\nincorporation of 18 U.S.C. S 1905, which criminalizes\r\n\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential or trade secret\r\n\ninformation. Again, section 1905 itself applies only to \"an\r\n\nofficer or employee of the United States or of any department\r\n\nor agency thereof\" and certain other persons not implicated\r\n\nhere.  Id.\r\n\n          Moreover, the legislative histories referencing the\r\n\nreporting provisions make little or no mention of the ancillary\r\n\nconfidentiality protections and certainly do not reveal any\r\n\nintent generally to safeguard industry ingredient-information\r\n\noutside of the lists provided to the Secretary. With regard to\r\n\nthe reporting provision in the CSEA, House Report 805\r\n\naccompanying the CSEA explains only that it \"would permit the\r\n\nfederal government to initiate the toxicologic research\r\n\nnecessary to measure any health risk posed by additives and\r\n\nother ingredients to cigarettes during the manufacturing\r\n\nprocess.\" H.R. Rep. No. 98-805, at 21, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\r\n\n3734. Senate Report 209 accompanying the Smokeless Tobacco Act\r\n\nstates only that the provision \"is included to further the\r\n\naccumulation of knowledge about the health risks of smokeless\r\n\n                            -66-\r                                         66\r\r\n\ntobacco use, particularly the possible hazards of substances\r\n\nadded to tobacco to enhance flavor and for other purposes.\" S.\r\n\nRep. No. 99-209 at 14, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. p. 13. The reports\r\n\nneither discuss nor elaborate upon the purpose of the\r\n\nconfidentiality protections.\r\n\n          The textual and historical indications lead to the\r\n\nconclusion that Congress primarily intended the reporting\r\n\nprovisions in the FCLAA and Smokeless Tobacco Act to further\r\n\ntoxicological research. By \"treat[ing]\" the collected\r\n\ninformation as a \"trade secret\" or \"confidential,\" the statutes\r\n\nfurther the primary research objective in a meaningful, but\r\n\nlimited, way: facilitating ready access to the ingredient\r\n\ninformation required for research purposes by assuring the\r\n\ntobacco industry that any trade secret interests in the\r\n\ninformation provided to the Secretary will be safeguarded.\r                                                                      In\r\n\nour view, the fact that Congress took great care to safeguard\r\n\nreported ingredient information at most indicates that Congress\r\n\npresumed the information's confidential nature for the purposes\r\n\nof its regime. Perhaps Congress even assumed that there was no\r\n\nquestion as to the trade secret status of the ingredient\r\n\ninformation. Underlying assumptions, however, do not merit\r\n\npreemptive force; legislative enactments do. Our review of the\r\n\n38.  Furthermore, the mere fact that Congress found an\r\naggregate form of ingredients disclosure sufficient for its\r\npurposes is no indication that increased state requirements\r\nwould conflict with its own scheme.\r\n\n                            -67-\r                                         67\r\r\n\nstatutory text and legislative history does not yield the\r\n\nrequisite clear and manifest congressional intent to speak\r\n\nnationally and finally on the general confidential status of\r\n\ntobacco-product ingredients.\r\n\n          Thus, while Congress proceeded expeditiously with its\r\n\nhealth research objectives by treating the ingredient\r\n\ninformation as a trade secret, it did not thereby preempt\r\n\nStates from otherwise lawfully obtaining (or attempting to\r\n\nobtain) such information. Moreover, that Congress did not\r\n\nintend through the FCLAA and Smokeless Tobacco Act nationally\r\n\nto protect all tobacco-product ingredients information does not\r\n\nnecessarily force the manufacturers to reveal their purported\r\n\ntrade secrets. The manufacturers may well have valid trade\r\n\nsecret interests that are threatened by the Disclosure Act.\r\n\nThe actual merit of any trade secret claim, however, is not\r\n\nbefore us now, and we are not at liberty to speculate as to the\r\n\n39.  We are thus unpersuaded by the manufacturers' citation of\r\nisolated bits of hearing testimony referring to the CSEA's\r\nprotection of \"trade secret\" ingredient information. \r                                                                See \r                                                                    e.g.,\r\n130 Cong. Rec. 24,626 (1984). Such statements, while\r\nindicative of Congress' intent to protect the presumed\r\nconfidential status of the information provided to the\r\nSecretary, do not reveal a purpose to grant tobacco-product\r\nmanufacturers nationwide immunity from state attempts to obtain\r\nand publicize ingredient information. \r                                                 Cf. \r                                                     Mortier, 501 U.S. at\r\n614-15 (finding no actual conflict where frustration of\r\npurported federal purpose relied on \"little more than snippets\r\nof legislative history and policy speculations\").\r\n\n                            -68-\r                                         68\r\r\n\nresolution of the issue.

Having found, however, that national\r\n\ntrade-secret protection of ingredient information is neither a\r\n\nfeature nor an objective of the statutes, the state law does\r\n\nnot \"nullify\" the federal confidentiality protections because\r\n\nthe information submitted under the federal regime itself is\r\n\nnot affected by it. In other words, enforcement of the\r\n\nDisclosure Act neither directly nor indirectly allows access to\r\n\nthe information in the HHS's possession. Moreover, because the\r\n\nDisclosure Act leaves completely unaffected the requirements,\r\n\nprocedures, and programs of the FCLAA and Smokeless Tobacco\r\n\nAct, it does not interfere with the methods by which Congress\r\n\nsought to reach its research and public-education goals.

From our review of the manufacturers' complaints, it\r\nappears that the merits of any trade secret claims underlie\r\ntheir takings and full faith and credit claims.\r\n\n                            -69-\r                                         69\r\r\n\nGeneral  \r                    Motors  \r                            Corp., 865 F.2d 395, 412 (1st Cir. 1988)\r\n\n(finding preempted negligence lawsuit for failure to install\r\n\nautomobile air bag where claim would interfere with Congress'\r\n\nscheme to subordinate the states' role in establishing safety\r\n\nstandards where pertinent federal standard exists).\r\n\n          The manufacturers seek solace in Hyde Park Partners\r\n\nv. Connolly, 839 F.2d 837 (1st Cir. 1988), involving the\r\n\npreemptive effect of the Williams Act, the sole purpose of\r\n\nwhich is \"the protection of investors confronted with a tender\r\n\noffer.\"   Id. at 849. The Williams Act requires takeover\r\n\nbidders to disclose their acquisition of a 5% stake in a\r\n\ncorporation within ten days \r                                       after the acquisition, \r                                                              id. at 851,\r\n\nwhereas the state law at issue penalized takeover bidders who\r\n\nfailed to disclose their intent before acquiring a 5% stake,\r\n\nid. at 840. We explained that the Williams Act struck a\r\n\ntemporal balance \"to provide shareholders with the best of both\r\n\nworlds -- disclosure substantial enough and early enough to\r\n\nensure fully informed choices, but not so early that those\r\n\nchoices will be unduly restricted by the chilling effect on\r\n\ntakeover bids.\" Id. at 852. We held that the state law, which\r\n\nwould likely \"discourage takeover attempts to a much greater\r\n\nextent than that envisioned by Congress\" to the detriment of\r\n\ninvestors, would intrude upon the federal law's careful \"point\r\n\nof equipoise\" and defeat the law's \"essential purpose.\"  Id. \r\n\n                            -70-\r                                         70\r\r\n\n          The manufacturers contend that, here, Congress\r\n\ncarefully chose a \"point of equipoise\" between ingredient\r\n\nreporting and confidentiality, which the Disclosure Act\r\n\nimpermissibly alters. We disagree. First, unlike the temporal\r\n\npublic-disclosure balance in \r                                        Hyde Park\r                                                 , the purported \"point of\r\n\nequipoise\" itself is not directly disturbed because the\r\n\nDisclosure Act has no effect on the federal laws' collection\r\n\nand safeguarding efforts with respect to the information\r\n\nprovided to the Secretary. Second, even assuming the state law\r\n\nsomehow altered the purported balance, \"[u]nder \r                                                           Hyde Park\r                                                                    , the\r\n\nquestion is not whether a congressionally calibrated system is\r\n\naltered by state law, but   if  \r                                            altered,  \r                                                     whether  \r                                                              the  \r                                                                   change\r\n\nobstructs the purpose of Congress\r                                            .\" Associated Indus. of Mass.\r\n\nv. Snow, 898 F.2d 274, 282 (1st Cir. 1990) (emphasis added).\r\n\nHere, the controlling purpose of the reporting provisions,\r\n\nwhich the confidentiality provisions further, is to permit\r\n\ntoxicological research to determine the health risks of\r\n\nadditives. See H.R. Rep. No. 98-805, at 21, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N.\r\n\nat 3734; S. Rep. No. 99-209 at 14, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. p. 13.\r\n\nAny alterations to the \"balance\" between reporting and\r\n\nconfidentiality posed by the Disclosure Act would not frustrate\r\n\nthis purpose. Rather, if the manufacturers' trade secret and\r\n\nother claims ultimately fail and the ingredient information\r\n\nthat the Disclosure Act mandates becomes public knowledge, the\r\n\nstate law arguably would further Congress' purpose.\r\n\n                            -71-\r                                         71\r\r\n\n          Finally, we find no evidence that Congress intended\r\n\nto effect national \"uniformity\" in ingredient reporting and\r\n\ndisclosure regulations. In  Wood, both the statutory language\r\n\nand legislative history indicated Congress' intent to effect\r\n\nuniform federal motor-vehicle safety standards throughout the\r\n\ncountry.  See 865 F.2d at 412;  see  also Rini v. United \r                                                                      Van\r\n\nLines, Inc.\r                      , 104 F.3d 502, 504 (1st Cir. 1997) (explaining that\r\n\n\"the principal purpose of the [Carmack] Amendment was to\r\n\nachieve national uniformity in the liability assigned to\r\n\ncarriers\"), petition for cert. filed, 65 U.S.L.W. 3422 (U.S.\r\n\nMar. 28, 1997) (No. 96-1800). In this case, while the\r\n\nstatutory language and legislative history show that Congress\r\n\nplainly intended to effect uniform labeling and warning\r\n\nrequirements, \r                         see 15 U.S.C. SS 1331, 1333, 1334, 4402, 4406(b),\r\n\nno such intent regarding ingredient disclosure is apparent.\r\n\nHad Congress desired similar uniformity in reporting and\r\n\ndisclosure efforts, it plainly knew how to accomplish that end.\r\n\nThe fact remains, however, that it did not.\r\n\n          In sum, the reporting provisions protect only the\r\n\nparticular information provided to the HHS while in the hands\r\n\nof HHS employees, and only from disclosure by HHS or certain\r\n\nfederal government employees. Congress considered the\r\n\n41.  We note the observation that a congressional determination\r\nto effect a nationally uniform standard presents \"a situation\r\nsimilar in practical effect to that of federal occupation of a\r\nfield.\" Tribe,  supra S 6-26, at 486.\r\n\n                            -72-\r                                         72\r\r\n\nsubmission of aggregate and anonymous ingredient information\r\n\nsufficient for its research purposes, and, to be sure, intended\r\n\nto safeguard the confidentiality of the information once\r\n\nprovided. Although Congress apparently accepted any claim to\r\n\nthe trade secret status of tobacco industry ingredient-\r\n\ninformation, it did not intend to immunize manufacturers\r\n\nnationally from any additional reporting or disclosure\r\n\nrequirements, or to prevent the public from becoming aware of\r\n\nsuch information other than that particularly provided to the\r\n\nHHS under the federal schemes. While enforcement of the\r\n\nDisclosure Act may ultimately make the confidentiality\r\n\nprotections somewhat redundant, it does not frustrate the\r\n\ncontrolling congressional purpose to initiate toxicological\r\n\nresearch on the effects of tobacco-product additives. In light\r\n\nof the strong presumption against preemption of state health-\r\n\nand-safety regulations that governs our analysis, we find that\r\n\nthe federal statutes' provisions to protect the confidentiality\r\n\nof tobacco-product ingredient information do not constitute a\r\n\n\"special feature\" overcoming that presumption.  See  English,\r\n\n496 U.S. at 72; Snow, 898 F.2d at 282.\r\n\n          4.  Field Occupation\r\n\n          Having found no actual conflict between the federal\r\n\nlaws and the Disclosure Act, we turn to the argument that the\r\n\nDisclosure Act nonetheless treads upon an exclusive federal\r\n\nregulatory domain. \"'Where . . . the field which Congress is\r\n\n                            -73-\r                                         73\r\r\n\nsaid to have pre-empted' includes areas that have 'been\r\n\ntraditionally occupied by the states,' congressional intent to\r\n\nsupersede state laws must be '\"clear and manifest.\"'\" \r                                                                 English,\r\n\n496 U.S. at 79 (quoting Jones v.

On this point, the Court's analysis in \r                                                               English is\r\n\ninstructive.

The Court disagreed, acknowledging that\r\n\nwhile the federal provision \"obviously bears some relation to\r\n\nthe field of nuclear safety, its 'paramount' purpose was the\r\n\nprotection of employees.\"   Id. at 83. Moreover, while the\r\n\nstate law \"in some remote way may [have] affect[ed] . . .\r\n\nnuclear safety decisions made by those who build and run\r\n\nnuclear facilities,\" it did not fall within the preempted realm\r\n\nbecause it did not have a \"direct and substantial effect\" on\r\n\nthe decisionmakers.

It would be\r\n\nspeculative, at best, to envision how the manufacturers'\r\n\nreporting obligations to the Massachusetts Department of Public\r\n\nHealth under the Disclosure Act might have a remote effect,\r\n\nmuch less a direct and substantial one, on federal efforts in\r\n\nthe area of labeling and advertising.  Cf. Schneidewind, 485\r\n\nU.S. at 308 (\"Of course, every state statute that has some\r\n\nindirect effect on [a preempted realm] is not pre-empted.\").\r\n\n          Thus, we find no indication in the federal statutes\r\n\nthat Congress intended to supplant any and all state\r\n\ninvolvement in the area of tobacco-product ingredient\r\n\ncollecting, monitoring, and review. In the absence of such\r\n\nindication, the mere detail by which the statutes collect and\r\n\nsafeguard ingredient information is insufficient to establish\r\n\na \"clear and manifest\" intent on the part of Congress to\r\n\nsupersede state laws, English, 496 U.S. at 79, or otherwise\r\n\novercome the presumption against preemption, see Hillsborough\r\n\nCounty, 471 U.S. at 715. \"Given this statutory scheme, it is\r\n\nfor Congress to rethink the division of regulatory authority in\r\n\nlight of its possible exercise by the States to undercut a\r\n\nfederal objective.\" Pacific Gas &amp; Electric\r                                                      v. \r                                                         Energy Resources\r\n\nComm'n, 461 U.S. 190, 223 (1983).\r\n\n43.

We are\r\n\nsatisfied, however, that it has not done so yet, and \"[t]he\r\n\ncourts should not assume the role which our system assigns to\r\n\nCongress.\"  Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, 461 U.S. at 223.\r\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we  affirm the district\r\n\ncourt's ruling that the Massachusetts Disclosure Act survives\r\n\nthe manufacturers preemption challenge.  Costs to Appellees.\r\n\nMassachusetts has no special or unique interest and that, by\r\nits very nature, it will necessarily have nationwide impact\r\nthereby contradicting a policy decision made for the nation by\r\nCongress. To the extent this argument touches upon the\r\n\"balance of national interests\" theory, we have disposed of\r\nthat above for the purposes of preemption analysis. To the\r\nextent the argument touches upon any Commerce Clause claims,\r\nsee generally Hyde Park, 825 F.2d at 843-48, the issue is not\r\nproperly before us here.\r\n\n                            -77-\r                                         77\r\r\n\n                         Appendix A\r\n\nIn its entirety, the Massachusetts Disclosure Act provides:\r\n\nS 307B.

This appeal implicates the\r\n\nconstitutionality of a Massachusetts statute requiring\r\n\nmanufacturers of tobacco products to disclose the additives and\r\n\nnicotine-yield ratings of their products to the state's public\r\n\nhealth department.  See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, S 307B (the\r\n\n\"Disclosure Act\"). Plaintiffs-appellants, various\r\n\nmanufacturers of cigarette and smokeless tobacco products\r\n\n(collectively, \"the manufacturers\"),   appeal the district\r\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment in favor of defendants-\r\n\nappellees, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of\r\n\nMassachusetts and the Massachusetts Public Health Commissioner\r\n\n(collectively, the \"Commonwealth\"). The district court ruled\r\n\nthat neither the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising\r\n\nAct, as amended (the \"FCLAA\"), 15 U.S.C. SS 1331-41, nor the\r\n\nComprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986\r\n\n(the \"Smokeless Tobacco Act\"), 15 U.S.C. SS 4401-08, preempts\r\n\nenforcement of the Disclosure Act. We affirm the district\r\n\n1.  The specific plaintiffs-appellants are Philip Morris\r\nIncorporated, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Brown &amp; Williamson\r\nTobacco Corporation, and Lorillard Tobacco Company (\"the\r\ncigarette manufacturers\") [case no. 97-8022], and United States\r\nTobacco Company, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation,\r\nConwood Company, L.P., National Tobacco Company, L.P., The\r\nPinkerton Tobacco Company, and Swisher International, Inc.\r\n(\"the smokeless tobacco manufacturers\") [case no. 97-8023].\r\n\n2.

Their complaints also allege\r\n\nthat the Disclosure Act violates the Constitution's Commerce\r\n\nClause, Full Faith and Credit Clause, Fourteenth Amendment Due\r\n\nProcess Clause, and Takings Clause. The parties cross-moved\r\n\nfor summary judgment in each case on the preemption claim\r\n\nonly. After denying the manufacturers' motions and granting\r\n\nthe Commonwealth's motions, the district court amended its\r\n\norders to certify the rulings for immediate appeal.   See 28\r\n\nU.S.C. S 1292(b). We accepted interlocutory review of the\r\n\norders. This appeal, therefore, presents only the preemption\r\n\nissue.\r\n\n3.  Because of the Disclosure Act's extended effective date,\r\nnow November 1, 1997, the district court deferred consideration\r\nof the manufacturers' contemporaneously filed preliminary\r\ninjunction motion.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n                     Standard of Review\r\n\n          We review the district court's summary judgment\r\n\nruling de novo.

The Disclosure Act\r\n\n          The Massachusetts Disclosure Act, the first state law\r\n\nof its kind, requires \"any manufacturer of cigarettes, snuff or\r\n\nchewing tobacco sold in the commonwealth\" to provide the\r\n\nMassachusetts Department of Public Health with a yearly report\r\n\nthat lists for each brand of product (1) any added constituents\r\n\n\"in descending order according to weight, measure, or numerical\r\n\ncount,\" and (2) nicotine yield ratings \"which shall accurately\r\n\npredict nicotine intake for average consumers.\" Mass. Gen.\r\n\nLaws ch. 94, S 307B. The Disclosure Act permits public access\r\n\nto the information reported upon an appropriate finding by the\r\n\ndepartment. Specifically, the Disclosure Act provides:\r\n\n          The nicotine yield ratings so provided,\r\n          and any other such information in the\r\n          annual reports with respect to which the\r\n          department determines that there is a\r\n\n5.  See Appendix A for the full text of the Disclosure Act,\r\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, S 307B.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          reasonable scientific basis for concluding\r\n          that the availability of such information\r\n          could reduce risks to public health, shall\r\n          be public records.\r\n\nId.\r\n\n          The public health department may not reveal the\r\n\ninformation, however, \"unless and until the attorney general\r\n\nadvises that such disclosure would not constitute an\r\n\nunconstitutional taking.\"     Id. Despite the apparent\r\n\nlimitations on the public health department's ability to\r\n\ndisclose reported information, the record evidence strongly\r\n\nindicates that Massachusetts officials intend to publicize the\r\n\ninformation. At oral argument before us, the Commonwealth\r\n\navoided direct questions on this issue, asserting that the\r\n\ndepartment's potential publication of the information was\r\n\nirrelevant for the purposes of preemption analysis. For the\r\n\npurposes of this case, we assume that the department will make\r\n\nthe information publicly available at the first legal and\r\n\npractical opportunity.\r\n\n          By all indications, the purpose of the Disclosure Act\r\n\nis to further the public health and education in the use of\r\n\ntobacco products. Most tellingly, the law prefaces its\r\n\nrequirements with the phrase, \"For the purpose of protecting\r\n\nthe public health.\" Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 94, S 307B. In\r\n\naddition, a press release from the Massachusetts Executive\r\n\nDepartment released the same day the law was enacted describes\r\n\nthe Disclosure Act as a \"consumer protection law\" intended to\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nfoster educated decision-making on the part of the consuming\r\n\npublic when choosing specific tobacco products and brands.\r\n\nB.  The Federal Laws\r\n\n          1.  FCLAA\r\n\n          In 1964, the United States Surgeon General's advisory\r\n\ncommittee issued a report that officially acknowledged the\r\n\nhealth hazards of cigarette smoking.  See Cipollone, 505 U.S.\r\n\nat 513. In response, the Federal Trade Commission, as well as\r\n\nseveral states, moved to impose various warning requirements in\r\n\nthe advertising and labeling of cigarettes.

In light of \"the potential maze of conflicting\r\n\nstate regulations\" on the subject, \r                                              Palmer, 825 F.2d at 622, and\r\n\nafter \"vigorous lobbying by all forms of interested groups and\r\n\nbusiness,\" \r                      id. at 623, Congress passed the first version of the\r\n\nFCLAA in 1965 (the \"1965 Act\").\r\n\n          Congress expressly declared its \"policy and purpose\"\r\n\nin passing the 1965 Act:\r\n\n          It is the policy of the Congress, and the\r\n          purpose of this chapter, to establish a\r\n          comprehensive Federal program to deal with\r\n          cigarette labeling and advertising with\r\n          respect to any relationship between\r\n          smoking and health, whereby --\r\n               (1) the public may be adequately\r\n          informed that cigarette smoking may be\r\n          hazardous to health by inclusion of a\r\n          warning to that effect on each package of\r\n          cigarettes; and\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n               (2) commerce and the national\r\n          economy may be (A) protected to the\r\n          maximum extent consistent with this\r\n          declared policy and (B) not impeded by\r\n          diverse, nonuniform, and confusing\r\n          cigarette labeling and advertising\r\n          regulations with respect to any\r\n          relationship between smoking and health.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1331.\r\n\n          The  Cipollone majority determined that the\r\n\ncongressional purposes expressed in this provision were as\r\n\nfollows:\r\n\n          (1) adequately informing the public that\r\n          cigarette smoking may be hazardous to\r\n          health, and (2) protecting the national\r\n          economy from the burden imposed by\r\n          diverse, nonuniform, and confusing\r\n          cigarette labeling and advertising\r\n          regulations.\r\n\n505 U.S. at 514. The Court explained that the 1965 Act\r\n\ncontained specific provisions \"[i]n furtherance of\" these two\r\n\ncongressional purposes. Id. To further the first purpose, the\r\n\n1965 Act mandated a specific warning label on each cigarette\r\n\npackage: \"CAUTION: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR\r\n\nHEALTH.\"  Id.  To further the second purpose,   see id., the\r\n\nstatute included a preemption provision, which, in part,\r\n\nprohibited the requirement of any \"statement relating to\r\n\nsmoking and health . . . on any cigarette package\" other than\r\n\nthe required warning. 15 U.S.C. S 1334(a). The 1965 Act's\r\n\npreemption clause further provided:\r\n\n6.  At the time, the warning was not required in cigarette\r\nadvertisements.\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                         10\r\r\n\n          (b) No statement relating to smoking and\r\n          health shall be required in the\r\n          advertising of any cigarettes the packages\r\n          of which are labeled in conformity with\r\n          the provisions of this Act.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1334(b) (1966),  amended by 15 U.S.C. S 1334(b)\r\n\n(1969).\r\n\n          By its own terms, the 1965 Act's provisions\r\n\npertaining to advertising were to terminate on July 1, 1969.\r\n\nSee Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 514. As that date approached,\r\n\nvarious federal agencies and states proposed new and differing\r\n\ncigarette advertising regulations.  See id. at 514-15. Faced\r\n\nwith these various initiatives, Congress amended the 1965 Act\r\n\nby enacting the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969\r\n\n(the \"1969 Act\"). The 1969 Act strengthened the wording of the\r\n\nrequired warning label: \"WARNING: THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS\r\n\nDETERMINED THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH.\"\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1333 (1969). The 1969 Act also prohibited\r\n\ncigarette advertising on television and radio and any other\r\n\n\"medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction\r\n\nof the Federal Communications Commission.\" 15 U.S.C. S 1335.\r\n\nRelatedly, the 1969 Act replaced subsection (b) of the 1965\r\n\n7.  For example, the Federal Communications Commission\r\nannounced its intention to consider a proposed rule that would\r\nban radio and television cigarette commercials, while the\r\nCalifornia Senate \"passed a total ban on both print and\r\nelectronic cigarette advertisements.\"  Cipollone, 505 U.S. at\r\n515 &amp; n.11.\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\nAct's preemption provision with the following language, which\r\n\nremains unmodified to this day:\r\n\n          (b) No requirement or prohibition based\r\n          on smoking and health shall be imposed\r\n          under State law with respect to the\r\n          advertising or promotion of any cigarettes\r\n          the packages of which are labeled in\r\n          conformity with the provisions of this\r\n          chapter.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1334(b).\r\n\n          The Senate Report accompanying the 1969 Act explained\r\n\nthat the revised preemption provision was necessary \"to avoid\r\n\nthe chaos created by a multiplicity of conflicting [cigarette\r\n\nadvertising] regulations.\" S. Rep. No. 91-566 (1970),\r\n\nreprinted in 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2652, 2663. Senate Report 566\r\n\nfurther explained:\r\n\n          The State preemption of regulation or\r\n          prohibition with respect to cigarette\r\n          advertising is narrowly phrased to preempt\r\n          only State action based on smoking and\r\n          health. It would in no way affect the\r\n          power of any State or political\r\n          subdivision of any State with respect to\r\n          the taxation or the sale of cigarettes to\r\n          minors, or the prohibition of smoking in\r\n          public buildings, or similar police\r\n          regulations. It is limited entirely to\r\n          State or local requirements or\r\n          prohibitions in the advertising of\r\n          cigarettes.\r\n\nId.\r\n\n8.  In part because the new preemption provision banned\r\nrestrictions imposed only \"under State law,\" in 1972 the\r\nFederal Trade Commission extended the warning requirements to\r\nprint advertisements, as well as package labels.          See\r\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 515.\r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\n          After thirteen years of scientific research following\r\n\nthe enactment of the 1969 Act, Congress further amended the\r\n\nFCLAA in 1984.    See H.R. Rep. No. 98-805, at 12 (1984),\r\n\nreprinted  \r                       in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3718, 3725. Renewed\r\n\ncongressional action in this area was in part prompted by\r\n\nSurgeon General reports identifying cigarette smoking as a\r\n\nsignificant risk factor in certain health problems.  See  id.\r\n\n(citing various reports). In light of the Surgeon General's\r\n\nfindings and testimony before congressional committees on the\r\n\nadverse health effects of smoking, Congress passed the\r\n\nComprehensive Smoking Education Act of 1984 (the \"CSEA\").\r\n\nHouse Report 805 states that the CSEA's purpose was \"to assist\r\n\nthe public to make an informed decision about whether or not to\r\n\nsmoke\" \"[b]y updating the cigarette warning, by giving\r\n\nvisibility and emphasis to smoking research and educational\r\n\nactivities at the Federal level, and by working closer with the\r\n\nprivate voluntary health section.\"  Id.\r\n\n          Specifically, the CSEA amended the FCLAA by\r\n\nestablishing a new warning system employing four different\r\n\nsmoking and health messages that would alternate quarterly on\r\n\nboth cigarette packages and cigarette advertisements.  See 15\r\n\nU.S.C. S 1333. To reflect the new multiple-warning system,\r\n\n9.  Specifically, the new required warnings, all preceded by\r\nthe phrase \"SURGEON GENERAL'S WARNING,\" are as follows:\r\n\n          Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease,\r\n          Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy.\r\n\n                            -13-\r                                         13\r\r\n\nCongress amended the language in the statute's purpose\r\n\nprovision from \"a warning . . . on each package of cigarettes\r\n\n[that] cigarette smoking may be hazardous to health\" to\r\n\n\"warning notices on each package of cigarettes and in each\r\n\nadvertisement of cigarettes [to inform the public] about any\r\n\nadverse health effects of cigarette smoking.\" S 1331(1);  see\r\n\nalso H.R. Rep. No. 98-805, at 21, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3734.\r\n\n          Significantly, the CSEA inserted an ingredient\r\n\nreporting provision that requires cigarette manufacturers to\r\n\n\"annually provide the Secretary [of Health and Human Services]\r\n\nwith a list of the ingredients added to tobacco in the\r\n\nmanufacture of cigarettes which does not identify the company\r\n\nwhich uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes which\r\n\ncontain the ingredients.\" S 1335a(a). The provision permits,\r\n\nbut does not mandate, \"[a] person or group of persons required\r\n\nto provide [the list] . . . [to] designate an individual or\r\n\nentity to provide the list.\"  Id. In other words, to satisfy\r\n\ntheir respective reporting obligations, the manufacturers at\r\n\ntheir option may submit ingredient lists to a designated agent\r\n\n          Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces\r\n          Serious Risks to Your Health.\r\n\n          Smoking by Pregnant Women May Result in\r\n          Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, and Low\r\n          Birth Weight.\r\n\n          Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1333(a).\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                         14\r\r\n\nwho, in turn, may transmit the information aggregately to the\r\n\nSecretary. Based on the information provided, the Secretary\r\n\nmust transmit a report to Congress, \"[a]t such times as the\r\n\nSecretary considers appropriate,\" on research activities\r\n\nregarding the health effects or risks of cigarette additives\r\n\nand \"any other information which the Secretary determines to be\r\n\nin the public interest.\" S 1335a(b)(1).\r\n\n          The ingredient reporting provision sets forth\r\n\ncomprehensive procedures for the Secretary's handling of the\r\n\ninformation provided. Specifically, S 1335(b)(2)(A) provides:\r\n\n          Any information provided to the Secretary\r\n          under subsection (a) of this section shall\r\n          be treated as trade secret or confidential\r\n          information subject to section 552(b)(4)\r\n          of Title 5 [providing a trade secret\r\n          exemption for disclosure under the Freedom\r\n          of Information Act] and section 1905 of\r\n          Title 18 [criminalizing disclosure of\r\n          confidential information by federal\r\n          officers or employees] and shall not be\r\n          revealed, except as provided in paragraph\r\n          (1) [respecting the Secretary's report to\r\n          Congress], to any person other than those\r\n          authorized by the Secretary in carrying\r\n          out their official duties under this\r\n          section.\r\n\n10.  The legislative history indicates that the ingredient\r\nreporting provision was intended to supply statutory authority\r\nto require the manufacturers to disclose such information and\r\nto \"supercede, in all respects, a voluntary agreement entered\r\ninto between the Department of [Health and Human Services] and\r\nthe tobacco industry in June, 1982.\" H.R. Rep. No. 98-805, at\r\n21, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3734. The House Report further\r\nexplains that the provisions \"would permit the federal\r\ngovernment to initiate the toxicologic research necessary to\r\nmeasure any health risk posed by the addition of additives and\r\nother ingredients to cigarettes during the manufacturing\r\nprocess.\"  Id.\r\n\n                            -15-\r                                         15\r\r\n\nDespite the above-quoted section, a different section directs\r\n\nthat the Secretary may not withhold the ingredient information\r\n\nfrom a requesting congressional committee or subcommittee. \r                                                                      See\r\n\nS 1335a(b)(2)(B).  When faced with such a request, the\r\n\nSecretary must make the list available \"and shall, at the same\r\n\ntime, notify in writing the person who provided the list of\r\n\nsuch request.\"  Id.\r\n\n          Finally, the ingredient reporting provision requires\r\n\nthe Secretary to ensure the confidentiality of the provided\r\n\ninformation through specified procedures, including (1) a\r\n\ndesignated custodian of the information who, when the\r\n\ninformation is not in use, \"shall store it in a locked cabinet\r\n\nor file\" and shall keep a record of those inspecting or using\r\n\nthe information, S 1335a(b)(2)(C), and (2) a requirement that\r\n\npersons \"permitted access to the information shall be\r\n\ninstructed in writing not to disclose the information to anyone\r\n\nwho is not entitled to have access to the information.\" Id.\r\n\n11.  The extent to which members of Congress are bound, if at\r\nall, by the disclosure prohibitions is unclear.\r\n\n12.  It appears, however, that the Secretary's efforts to\r\nnotify the \"person who provided the list\" may be made more\r\ndifficult by S 1335a(a)'s option for such persons to provide\r\nthe list anonymously through a third individual or entity.\r\n\n13.  In addition to amending the FCLAA, the CSEA also directed\r\nthe Secretary to \"establish and carry out a program to inform\r\nthe public of any dangers to human health presented by\r\ncigarette smoking.\" 15 U.S.C. S 1341. Pursuant to that\r\nprogram, the Secretary must, \r                                        inter \r                                             alia, coordinate research on\r\nsmoking and health and disseminate pertinent information to the\r\npublic.  See  id. at S 1341(a). To carry out some of the\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\n          2.  Smokeless Tobacco Act\r\n\n          By the mid-1980's, Congress became concerned that the\r\n\nfederal government's activities regarding the health hazards of\r\n\ncigarette smoking had no parallel with respect to smokeless\r\n\ntobacco products such as chewing tobacco and snuff.   See S.\r\n\nRep. No. 99-209, at 3-4 (1986), \r                                           reprinted \r                                                     in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N.\r\n\n7, 9-10. According to the Senate Report, the almost-forgotten\r\n\nsmokeless tobacco industry had staged a recent resurgence, and\r\n\nits products had become popular among youth who apparently\r\n\nconsidered such products a safe alternative to cigarette\r\n\nsmoking.  See id. Further evidence suggested that smokeless\r\n\ntobacco products contained \"significant levels of nicotine\" and\r\n\nwere linked with serious health problems, including oral\r\n\ncancer. S. Rep. No. 99-209, at 3, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 9.\r\n\nThese factors led to regulatory action on various fronts\r\n\nregarding warning requirements. For example, a Massachusetts\r\n\nexecutive order required warning labels on the packages and in\r\n\nthe advertisements of smokeless tobacco products.         Id.\r\n\nAdditionally, prominent health organizations called for\r\n\nlegislation requiring warnings, and the FTC enlisted the\r\n\nSurgeon General's help in considering a petition seeking\r\n\nprogram's purposes, the CSEA established an Interagency\r\nCommittee on Smoking and Health.  See id. at S 1341(b). The\r\nSecretary also must transmit specified reports to Congress\r\nregarding efforts made to inform the public of the health\r\nhazards of smoking and other information.        See  id. at\r\nS 1341(c).\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                         17\r\r\n\nwarning label requirements.  See S. Rep. No. 99-209, at 4-5,\r\n\n1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 10-11.\r\n\n          In response to such regulatory efforts, Congress\r\n\npassed the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act\r\n\nof 1986 (the \"Smokeless Tobacco Act\"). The Senate Report\r\n\nexplains that the Act, \"for the most part, simply extends the\r\n\nprovisions of . . . the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act of\r\n\n1984, to include smokeless tobacco products.\" S. Rep. No. 99-\r\n\n209, at 5, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 11. Thus, the Smokeless\r\n\nTobacco Act contains features similar, but not identical, to\r\n\nthe FCLAA as amended by the CSEA.\r\n\n          Like the CSEA, the Smokeless Tobacco Act calls for\r\n\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to \"establish and\r\n\ncarry out a program to inform the public of any dangers to\r\n\nhuman health resulting from the use of smokeless tobacco\r\n\nproducts.\" 15 U.S.C. S 4401. The statute bans the advertising\r\n\nof smokeless tobacco on radio and television,  see 15 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 4402(f), and establishes a rotating warning requirement for\r\n\npackage labels and advertising, with specific warnings\r\n\nregarding the potential adverse health effects of smokeless\r\n\ntobacco products.  See S 4402.\r\n\n14.  The specific texts of the alternative warnings, all\r\npreceded by the word \"WARNING,\" read:\r\n\n          THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE MOUTH CANCER.\r\n\n          THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE GUM DISEASE AND\r\n          TOOTH LOSS.\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\n          Congress included in the Smokeless Tobacco Act an\r\n\nexpress preemption provision which states, in pertinent part:\r\n\n               No statement relating to the use\r\n               of smokeless tobacco products\r\n               and health, other than the\r\n               statements required by [this\r\n               act], shall be required by any\r\n               State or local statute or\r\n               regulation to be included on any\r\n               package or in any advertisement\r\n               . . . of a smokeless tobacco\r\n               product.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 4406(b). Unlike the FCLAA, the Smokeless Tobacco\r\n\nAct contains a \"savings clause,\" which provides: \"Nothing in\r\n\nthis chapter shall relieve any person from liability at common\r\n\nlaw or under State statutory law to any other person.\" 15\r\n\nU.S.C. S 4406(c).  \r\n\n          The Smokeless Tobacco Act similarly provides for\r\n\nanonymous and aggregate ingredient reporting to the Secretary\r\n\n          THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO\r\n          CIGARETTES.\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 4402(a)(1).\r\n\n15.  Additionally, the Smokeless Tobacco Act specifically\r\nprecludes any   federal  \r                                     agency from requiring any such\r\nstatements.  See 15 U.S.C. S 4406(a).\r\n\n16.  Senate Report 209 explains that \"the Committee [on Labor\r\nand Human Resources\" wants to emphasize that by including\r\nprovisions in [the Act] which require health warnings on\r\npackages and advertisements for smokeless tobacco products, and\r\nby preempting State and local laws requiring additional health\r\nwarnings, it does not intend to preempt a State's ability to\r\ncontrol the promotion or advertising of tobacco products and\r\ndoes not intend to preempt product liability suits in State or\r\nFederal courts based on failure to warn.\" S. Rep. No. 99-209,\r\nat 14, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 13.\r\n\n                            -19-\r                                         19\r\r\n\nof Health and Human Services. S 4403(a).   Unlike the FCLAA,\r\n\nhowever, the Smokeless Tobacco Act also requires smokeless\r\n\ntobacco manufacturers to specify the nicotine quantity\r\n\ncontained in each product.  Id. The statute's provisions for\r\n\nthe Secretary's handling of the information are essentially\r\n\nidentical to those in the FCLAA, except for the absence of a\r\n\ncross reference to 18 U.S.C. S 1905, which criminalizes\r\n\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  Compare\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 1335(b)(2)(A) with 15 U.S.C. S 4403(b)(2). The\r\n\nstatute also requires the Secretary to transmit informative and\r\n\nadvisory reports to Congress.  See 15 U.S.C. S 4407.\r\n\nC.  Preemption Principles\r\n\n          Having reviewed the federal and state statutes at\r\n\nissue in this case, we now consider the preemption principles\r\n\nthat control our analysis of the question whether federal law\r\n\neither explicitly or impliedly preempts the challenged state\r\n\nlaw.

While a majority of the Court held that the 1965 Act did\r\n\nnot preempt state common-law damages actions, see  Cipollone,\r\n\n505 U.S. at 518-19, a plurality found that the 1969 Act's\r\n\n\"broader\" preemption language did encompass some common law\r\n\nclaims, see id. at 520-21.\r\n\n          To determine whether or not a particular common law\r\n\nclaim fell within the express preemption clause, the plurality\r\n\nformulated the following \"central inquiry\": \"we ask whether\r\n\nthe legal duty that is the predicate of the common-law damages\r\n\naction constitutes a 'requirement or prohibition based on\r\n\nsmoking and health . . . imposed under State law with respect\r\n\nto . . . advertising and promotion,' giving that clause a fair\r\n\nbut narrow reading.\" Id. at 524.

See,  e.g., S 1331(1) (referring to the\r\n\"inclusion of warning notices on each package . . . and \r                                                                  in each\r\nadvertisement of cigarettes\" (emphasis added)); S 1333(a)(2)\r\n(\"It shall be unlawful for any manufacturer . . . of cigarettes\r\nto advertise or cause to be advertised . . . any cigarette\r\nunless the advertising bears [a required label]\") (emphasis\r\nadded); S 1333(a)(3) (involving similar requirement for outdoor\r\nbillboard advertisements); S 1335 (making it illegal for\r\nmanufacturers \"to advertise\" on radio and television); S 1336\r\n(acknowledging the Federal Trade Commission's authority in the\r\narea of unfair practices \"in the advertising of cigarettes\")\r\n(emphasis added); S 1337 (requiring the FTC to transmit annual\r\nreports to Congress \"concerning . . . current practices and\r\nmethods of \"cigarette  advertising \r                                               and \r                                                   promotion\") (emphasis\r\nadded).\r\n\n                            -32-\r                                         32\r\r\n\nmanufacturers do not seriously dispute this conclusion, they\r\n\nsubmit that the Disclosure Act's requirements are \"with respect\r\n\nto\" advertising and promotion within the meaning of S 1334(b).\r\n\n            The cigarette manufacturers theorize that the\r\n\nFCLAA, through its mandated warning labels and express\r\n\npreemption language, exclusively delineates the necessary and\r\n\nsufficient health information that cigarette manufacturers may\r\n\nbe compelled to communicate to the public. They contend that\r\n\nsection 1334(b), therefore, in addition to preempting\r\n\nrequirements to change cigarette labels or advertisements,\r\n\nprohibits any additional requirement to communicate to the\r\n\npublic about smoking and health. The manufacturers reason that\r\n\nthe Disclosure Act, although styled as an agency reporting\r\n\nrequirement, essentially compels them to communicate additional\r\n\nsmoking and health information to the public because the health\r\n\ndepartment will make the information publicly available. They\r\n\nassert that S 1334(b) would be rendered meaningless if the\r\n\nCommonwealth may accomplish indirectly what it may not\r\n\naccomplish directly by using the state agency \"as a conduit\"\r\n\nfor the manufacturers' compelled communication. In short, they\r\n\nclaim that the Disclosure Act impermissibly requires them to\r\n\nparticipate in what amounts to a public service advertising\r\n\ncampaign intended to supplement the federally mandated\r\n\nwarnings.\r\n\n                            -33-\r                                         33\r\r\n\n          In  Cipollone, two of the Court's opinions\r\n\nspecifically analyzed the phrase \"with respect to . . .\r\n\nadvertising and promotion\": Justice Stevens' four-vote\r\n\nplurality opinion, which interpreted the phrase narrowly, and\r\n\nJustice Scalia's opinion concurring in part and dissenting in\r\n\npart, in which Justice Thomas joined, which interpreted the\r\n\nphrase more broadly. We note initially that the six Justices\r\n\nrepresented by these two opinions apparently agreed that the\r\n\npreemption clause reached plaintiffs' failure-to-warn claims,\r\n\nat least insofar as they required proof that the manufacturers'\r\n\n\"post-1969 advertising or promotions should have included\r\n\nadditional, or more clearly stated, warnings.\" 505 U.S. at 524\r\n\n(plurality); see id. at 554 (Scalia, J., concurring in part,\r\n\ndissenting in part);   see  also  Palmer, 825 F.2d at 627\r\n\n(explaining that successful failure-to-warn claim effectively\r\n\ncompels manufacturers to alter warning labels).\r\n\n          The four-member plurality further found, however,\r\n\nthat the preemption clause did not bar \"[failure-to-warn]\r\n\nclaims that rely solely on [the cigarette manufacturers']\r\n\ntesting or research practices or other actions  unrelated \r                                                                       to\r\n\nadvertising  \r                        or  \r                            promotion.\"   Cipollone 505 U.S. at 524-25\r\n\n(emphasis added). Moreover, under the plurality's reasoning,\r\n\n24.  Justice Blackmun's concurring and dissenting opinion,\r\njoined by two other Justices, expressed the view that the 1969\r\nAct's preemption clause did not reach state common law claims\r\nat all. Thus, these three Justices expressed no view on the\r\nmeaning of the phrase at issue here.\r\n\n                            -34-\r                                         34\r\r\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation claims survived \"insofar as those\r\n\nclaims rely on a state-law duty to disclose such facts \r                                                                  through\r\n\nchannels of communication other than advertising or promotion\r                                                                       .\"\r\n\nId. at 528 (emphasis added). Significantly, the plurality\r\n\noffered the following by way of illustration: \"Thus, for\r\n\nexample, if state law obliged respondents to disclose material\r\n\nfacts about smoking and health  to \r                                               an \r                                                  administrative \r                                                                  agency,\r\n\n[sec. 1334(b)] would not pre-empt a state-law claim based on a\r\n\nfailure to fulfill that obligation.\"  Id. (emphasis added).\r\n\n          Under the plurality's reasoning, there appears to be\r\n\nlittle doubt that the Disclosure Act is not \"with respect to\"\r\n\nadvertising or promotion because the manufacturers do not\r\n\nsatisfy their obligation to file annual reports to the state\r\n\nhealth department \"through\" an advertising or promotion\r\n\nchannel.   See 505 U.S. at 528 (plurality). The agency's\r\n\npotential release of the information to the public would seem\r\n\nto raise no concern with the plurality, which was not otherwise\r\n\ntroubled about compelled communication to the public through\r\n\nalternative, non-advertising, non-promotional channels (i.e.,\r\n\nin duties underlying certain surviving failure to warn and\r\n\nfraudulent misrepresentation claims), for the purposes of the\r\n\nlanguage at issue. Thus, we believe that the plurality's\r\n\nreasoning militates towards the Commonwealth's position.\r\n\n          Justice Scalia's opinion, concurring in part and\r\n\ndissenting in part, disagreed with the plurality's conclusion\r\n\n                            -35-\r                                         35\r\r\n\nthat a state law claim based on the failure to warn consumers\r\n\n\"'through channels of communication other than advertising or\r\n\npromotion'\" would not come within S 1334(b)'s preemptive scope.\r\n\nId. at 554 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part)\r\n\n(quoting plurality opinion, id. at 528). While acknowledging\r\n\nthat the FCLAA clearly does not preempt claims unrelated to\r\n\nindustry advertising and promotion, Justice Scalia reasoned\r\n\nthat it preempts \"claims based on duties that can be complied\r\n\nwith by taking action    either within the advertising and\r\n\npromotional realm \r                             or elsewhere\r                                         .\"  Id. at 554. Thus, according\r\n\nto Justice Scalia, although a product warning could be\r\n\ncommunicated in many ways, S 1334(b) would preempt the duty as\r\n\na whole because it could be satisfied through advertising or\r\n\npromotion.  See id. at 554-55.\r\n\n          Justice Scalia's opinion also intimated, however,\r\n\nthat a hypothetical law requiring disclosure of product health-\r\n\nhazards to a state public-health agency would bear \"no\r\n\nrelation\" to industry advertising and promotion.  Id. at 554.\r\n\nHe further speculated that such a law \"would seem to survive\"\r\n\na proposed \"practical compulsion\" test to determine the\r\n\n25.  Noting that manufacturers normally communicate required\r\nproduct warnings through advertising and promotion, Justice\r\nScalia found it \"implausible that Congress meant to save\r\ncigarette companies from being compelled to convey such data to\r\nconsumers through that means, only to allow them to be\r\ncompelled to do so through means more onerous still.\"\r\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 555 (Scalia, J., concurring in part,\r\ndissenting in part).\r\n\n                            -36-\r                                         36\r\r\n\nviability of a state law, which he phrased as: \"whether the law\r\n\npractically compels the manufacturers to engage in behavior\r\n\nthat Congress has barred the States from prescribing directly.\"\r\n\nId. at 555 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in\r\n\npart). Justice Scalia's opinion suggests that because the\r\n\nhypothetical law's requirements could not possibly be satisfied\r\n\nthrough advertising and promotional efforts, the law would not\r\n\n\"practically compel\" the manufacturers \"to relinquish the\r\n\nadvertising and promotion immunity accorded them by the Act.\"\r\n\nId. at 555.\r\n\n          In this case, of course, we are presented with an\r\n\nagency reporting requirement coupled with the probability that\r\n\nthe information provided will be made public. Although the\r\n\nhealth department will likely publicize the required reports,\r\n\nthe Disclosure Act does not \"practically compel\" the\r\n\nmanufacturers to communicate smoking and health information to\r\n\nthe public within Justice Scalia's explication because, while\r\n\nthe communicative action to consumers could alternatively be\r\n\nachieved through advertising and promotional efforts, the\r\n\nDisclosure Act itself admits of no such alternative to\r\n\ncompliance. There is no suggestion that the manufacturers\r\n\ncould somehow comply with the Disclosure Act simply by changing\r\n\ntheir advertising or promotional materials. Moreover, direct\r\n\ncommunication of the additive and nicotine-yield information to\r\n\nthe public through some other means would not excuse the\r\n\n                            -37-\r                                         37\r\r\n\nmanufacturers' duties under the law. Thus viewed, the\r\n\nDisclosure Act would survive even Justice Scalia's more\r\n\nexpansive, but distinct minority view of the preemption clause.\r\n\n          While our \r                               Cipollone-based analysis necessarily draws\r\n\nupon the dicta of six Justices who were not presented with an\r\n\nactual agency-reporting scheme, much less a scheme that\r\n\ncontemplates the public release of the information reported, we\r\n\nbelieve that the Justices' observations suggest a qualitative\r\n\ndifference, for S 1334(b) purposes, between direct\r\n\ncommunication with the public and disclosure to a state agency.\r\n\nThe fact that public health agencies exist to serve the public,\r\n\nand the absence of any secrecy mandates in the      Cipollone\r\n\nopinions discussing state agency reporting requirements,\r\n\nfurther suggest that the agency's ultimate use of the\r\n\ninformation does not bear on the question whether such a\r\n\nreporting scheme relates to advertising and promotion. In the\r\n\nend, we believe that \r                                Cipollone weighs strongly in favor of the\r\n\nCommonwealth's position.\r\n\n          In the wake of Cipollone, several courts have dealt\r\n\nspecifically with the question whether a state statute or\r\n\ncommon-law damages action, in various contexts, implicates the\r\n\nphrase, \"with respect to . . . advertising or promotion.\"\r\n\nS 1334(b). In general, the cases yield a broad interpretation\r\n\nof the language at issue. Not surprisingly, therefore, the\r\n\nmanufacturers rely heavily on select language from them.\r\n\n                            -38-\r                                         38\r\r\n\nAlthough none of the cases involves a state-agency reporting\r\n\nscheme, we review them to contextualize the manufacturers'\r\n\narguments and to indicate how the cases differ from the instant\r\n\ndispute.\r\n\n          In \r                        Vango Media, Inc.\r                                          v. \r                                             City of New York\r                                                            , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677322\"><a href=\"/opinion/677322/vango-media-inc-v-the-city-of-new-york-the-new-york-city-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n\n70 (2d Cir. 1994), the Second Circuit held that the FCLAA\r\n\nexpressly preempted a city ordinance requiring an advertising\r\n\nbusiness to display a minimum of one public health message\r\n\nabout the dangers of smoking (or the benefits of not smoking)\r\n\nfor every four tobacco advertisements. The court reasoned that\r\n\nthe phrase \"with respect to\" in S 1334(b) is essentially\r\n\nsynonymous with \"relating to,\" which, in turn, the Supreme\r\n\nCourt has interpreted broadly.

The court concluded that the city ordinance directly\r\n\ncontravened the FCLAA's purpose of avoiding diverse advertising\r\n\nregulations and \"tread[ed] on the area of tobacco advertising,\r\n\neven if . . . only at the edges.\"  Id. at 74.\r\n\n          In this case, the cigarette manufacturers argue that\r\n\nVango Media\r                       establishes that the FCLAA preempts any attempt to\r\n\nrequire anyone to provide smoking and health messages to the\r\n\n                            -39-\r                                         39\r\r\n\npublic through  any  \r                                media, even media other than industry\r\n\nadvertisements. They argue that the Disclosure Act surely\r\n\ncomes within this vast preempted realm. We do not read  Vango\r\n\nMedia so expansively. In   Vango \r                                             Media, the very display of\r\n\ntobacco advertisements invoked the city ordinance requirements,\r\n\nthus evincing a direct and substantial connection between the\r\n\nordinance and industry advertising.   See id. at 74-75. The\r\n\nDisclosure Act, on the other hand, does not impose conditions\r\n\nupon tobacco advertising or promotional decisions, which are\r\n\nirrelevant to the Disclosure Act's obligations.\r\n\n          Moreover, even assuming (without deciding) that \"with\r\n\nrespect to\" is synonymous with \"relate to,\" the Disclosure Act\r\n\ndoes not \"relate to\" advertising or promotion because it lacks\r\n\nthe requisite \"reference to\" or \"connection with\" the preempted\r\n\nrealm.

Lacey v.\r\n\nLorillard Tobacco Co., 956 F. Supp 956, 958 (N.D. Ala. 1997).\r\n\nAfter reviewing the FCLAA's scheme and obligations, the court\r\n\nfound the claim preempted because it was \"based upon an alleged\r\n\nduty . . . to provide to consumers more information regarding\r\n\nsmoking and health than is required by the [FCLAA],\"  id. at\r\n\n963, and because its additional disclosure obligations\r\n\n\"unavoidably attack[ed]\" the manufacturers' advertising and\r\n\npromotion, id. at 962.\r\n\n          Here, we are presented with more than a vague \"tell-\r\n\nthe-consumers-any-way-you-wish\" claim. Cipollone, 505 U.S. at\r\n\n555 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part).\r\n\nSpecifically, the Disclosure Act requires that ingredient\r\n\nreports be filed with a state agency; the reports themselves\r\n\nare plainly outside the realm of advertising or promotion.\r\n\nUnlike plaintiff's theory in Sonnenreich, the Disclosure Act\r\n\ndoes not require the manufacturers to produce materials and\r\n\ndisseminate information to consumers through techniques, such\r\n\n26.  The Lacey court acknowledged the  Cipollone plurality's\r\nsuggestion that the FCLAA would not preempt a state law\r\nrequirement to disclose smoking-and-health facts to an\r\nadministrative agency.  See 956 F. Supp at 962. The court\r\nexplained, however, that the law of the pertinent state\r\n(Alabama) imposed no such obligation.  See id. \r\n\n                            -43-\r                                         43\r\r\n\nas seminars or direct mailings, that resemble promotional\r\n\nefforts and impel the fostering of a product ideology. Unlike\r\n\nthe plaintiff's claim in Lacey, the Disclosure Act does not\r\n\nimpose a duty upon manufacturers to provide additional smoking\r\n\nand health information directly to the public.\r\n\n          There would arguably appear to be little difference\r\n\nbetween requiring manufacturers to disseminate ingredient\r\n\ninformation directly to the public and requiring them to file\r\n\nsuch information with a state agency, which, in turn, will make\r\n\nthe information publicly available. Nevertheless, there is a\r\n\ndifference, and we are unpersuaded by the manufacturers'\r\n\nargument that the difference is not substantively important.\r\n\nMoreover, we find doubtful their expansive interpretation of\r\n\nthe with-respect-to-advertising-and-promotion condition.\r\n\n          While we need not decide the issue now, we are\r\n\nskeptical of the manufacturers' sweeping proposition that the\r\n\nFCLAA prescribes the exclusive means by which they may be\r\n\ncompelled to communicate health information directly to the\r\n\npublic. On this point, we find informative the      Cipollone\r\n\nplurality's preservation of some claims that were based, in\r\n\npart, on the duty to communicate smoking-and-health information\r\n\nto the public.    See 505 U.S. at 524-25 (failure-to-warn\r\n\nclaims); \r                    id. at 528 (fraudulent misrepresentation claims). The\r\n\nsurvival of such claims undermines the premise that the FCLAA\r\n\ndelineates the exclusive scope of consumer-communication\r\n\n                            -44-\r                                         44\r\r\n\nduties, and furthermore suggests the very existence of a subset\r\n\nof such requirements that are wholly unrelated to advertising\r\n\nand promotion. We also find informative the legislative\r\n\nhistory's repeated reference to the \"narrow\" and \"limited\"\r\n\nnature of the preemption provision and declaration that the\r\n\nprovision \"is limited entirely to State or local requirements\r\n\nor prohibitions in the advertising of cigarettes.\" S. Rep. 91-\r\n\n566, 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 2663.\r\n\n          Our skepticism aside, significantly, the Disclosure\r\n\nAct does not require the manufacturers to communicate directly\r\n\nwith consumers. Of course, a quintessential state requirement\r\n\n\"with respect to . . . advertising and promotion\" would be a\r\n\nlaw mandating changes or additions to the content of cigarette\r\n\nadvertisements. One step removed from such a law would be a\r\n\nrequirement that manufacturers mass-communicate additional\r\n\nwarnings or other smoking-and-health information directly to\r\n\nconsumers through channels other than advertising or promotion.\r\n\nAt this point, the argument in favor of preemption begins to\r\n\nweaken given the \r                            Cipollone plurality's seemingly narrow concern\r\n\nwith requirements specifically involving advertising and\r\n\npromotional channels.  See 505 U.S. at 524-25, 528. Further\r\n\nremoved yet would be a requirement to disclose such information\r\n\nto some entity other than the consuming public. While one can\r\n\nimagine subsequent intermediate steps, at some point we reach\r\n\nthe agency reporting scheme before us.\r\n\n                            -45-\r                                         45\r\r\n\n          We think that the agency-reporting scheme prescribed\r\n\nunder the Disclosure Act is insufficiently related to the\r\n\nadvertising and promotion realm to bring the state law within\r\n\nS 1334(b)'s preemptive scope. As noted above, the reports\r\n\nrequired under the Disclosure Act do not themselves constitute\r\n\nor resemble promotional material. Once the manufacturers file\r\n\nthe reports with the state public health agency, their\r\n\ncommunicative obligation ceases. They will not be required to\r\n\ndisseminate further the reported information, which becomes\r\n\npublic (if at all), solely through agency action. Thus, unlike\r\n\nan obligation to advise consumers \r                                             directly of any information,\r\n\nwhich may compel the manufacturers to engage in activity\r\n\nresembling advertising and promotional efforts, the Disclosure\r\n\nAct requires no such exertion. In fact, the law separates the\r\n\nnormal source of product advertising and promotion, the tobacco\r\n\nindustry, from any direct communicative action to the public.\r\n\nThat the information contained in the report may eventually\r\n\nbecome widely disseminated does not transform the\r\n\nmanufacturer's initial reporting obligation into an advertising\r\n\nor promotional activity. In our view, an implied\r\n\ntransformation of this sort would distort the language of\r\n\nS 1334(b) beyond Congress' intent. In short, the line between\r\n\n\"with respect to\" and \"no relation to\" advertising and\r\n\npromotion must be crossed at some point, and although we need\r\n\n                            -46-\r                                         46\r\r\n\nnot pinpoint that exact location now, we think it has been\r\n\ncrossed here.\r\n\n          Moreover, we disagree with the manufacturers'\r\n\nargument that the Disclosure Act meets this condition because\r\n\nit reflects the Commonwealth's \"impermissible judgment\" that\r\n\nthe federally-mandated health warnings are inadequate and thus\r\n\nconstitutes an attack upon those warnings. The      Cipollone\r\n\nplurality specifically rejected the proposition that S 1334(b)\r\n\nbroadly preempts any claim that inevitably questions the\r\n\nsuitability of the manufacturers' advertising and promotion\r\n\nactivities. See 505 U.S. at 525 (discussing breach-of-express-\r\n\nwarranty claim). As the plurality stated: \"The appropriate\r\n\ninquiry is not whether a claim challenges the 'propriety' of\r\n\nadvertising and promotion, but whether the claim would require\r\n\nthe imposition under state law of a requirement or prohibition\r\n\nbased on smoking and health with respect to advertising or\r\n\npromotion.\"  Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 525.   This observation\r\n\nindicates that the relevant inquiry focuses not upon any\r\n\nrelation between advertising and the \r                                                motivation behind a state\r\n\n27.

Thus, the mere suggestion that state\r\n\nlawmakers sought passage of the Disclosure Act in part because\r\n\nof their discontent with federal regulatory efforts does not\r\n\naffect our preemption analysis.\r\n\n          We find, therefore, that the reach of the FCLAA's\r\n\nexpress preemption clause, S 1334(b), does not preclude\r\n\nenforcement of the Disclosure Act. We reach this conclusion\r\n\neven assuming that underlying the state law is discontent with\r\n\nthe federally mandated warnings and the desire to communicate\r\n\nthe additive and nicotine-yield information to the public.\r\n\nLooking to the actual effect of the state law, the Disclosure\r\n\nAct does not require alterations in the industry's advertising\r\n\nand promotional activities, or impose any duty to disclose\r\n\ninformation through those channels. The state law's\r\n\nobligations are neither triggered by advertising decisions, nor\r\n\ncould they be fulfilled by altering cigarette labels or\r\n\nadvertisements. The law does not direct the manufacturers to\r\n\nemploy any mass-marketing or other techniques even remotely\r\n\nresembling advertising and promotion.

Thus, we find the\r\n\nexplicit preemption language and legislative history\r\n\ninsufficient to \"clear[ly] and manifest[ly]\" overcome the\r\n\npresumption against preemption of a state's traditional powers\r\n\nto legislate for the health and safety of its citizens.\r\n\nMortier, 510 U.S. at 606; \r                                     see \r                                        Dillingham Constr.\r                                                          , 117 S.

Smokeless Tobacco Act\r\n\n          Our inquiry into the scope of the Smokeless Tobacco\r\n\nAct's preemption clause is considerably simpler than the\r\n\npreceding analysis. The Smokeless Tobacco Act provides that\r\n\n          No statement relating to the use of\r\n          smokeless tobacco products and health,\r\n          other than the statements required by\r\n          [this act], shall be required by any State\r\n\n28.  The manufacturers do not argue that the 1984 amendments to\r\nthe FCLAA wrought by the CSEA in any manner changed or affected\r\nthe meaning of the express preemption clause, last amended in\r\n1969. Thus, we do not address the question whether the\r\ningredient reporting requirements or other amendments affect\r\nthe express preemption analysis.\r\n\n                            -49-\r                                         49\r\r\n\n          or local statute or regulation to be\r\n          included  on  \r                                    any  \r                                          package or   in  \r                                                            any\r\n          advertisement (unless the advertisement is\r\n          an outdoor billboard advertisement) of a\r\n          smokeless tobacco product.]\r\n\n15 U.S.C. S 4406(b) (emphasis added).\r\n\n          We find dispositive the phrases \"\r                                                      on any package\" and\r\n\n\"in any advertisement,\" which differ significantly from the\r\n\nbroader \"with respect to\" language in the FCLAA's preemption\r\n\nprovision.   Cf.  Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 520 (plurality)\r\n\n(explaining that the clause, \"\r                                         with respect to\r                                                        . . . advertising\r\n\nand promotion,\" in the 1969 Act was notably broader than its\r\n\npredecessor, \"\r                         in the advertising,\" in the 1965 Act); \r                                                               id. at 554\r\n\n(Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part)\r\n\n(suggesting same). Because the Disclosure Act only requires\r\n\nthe manufacturers to file certain reports to the Massachusetts\r\n\nDepartment of Public Health, plainly it does not require a\r\n\n\"statement\" of any kind \"to be included on any package or in\r\n\nany advertisement.\"     Cf.  id. at 518 (majority opinion)\r\n\n(explaining that similar language in 1965 Act \"merely\r\n\nprohibited . . . particular cautionary statements on cigarette\r\n\nlabels . . . or in cigarette advertisements\"). The Smokeless\r\n\nTobacco Act's express preemption clause, therefore, does not\r\n\ninvalidate the Disclosure Act.\r\n\n29.  For the reasons stated in our FCLAA express preemption\r\nanalysis, we reject the manufacturers' argument that the\r\npublicizing of the ingredient lists effectively transforms the\r\nlists into an \"advertisement\" within the meaning of S 4406(b).\r\n\n                            -50-\r                                         50\r\r\n\n           We observe that our holding is wholly consistent\r\n\nwith the Smokeless Tobacco Act's \"savings clause\" which\r\n\npreserves, \r                      inter \r                            alia, state common-law failure to warn claims.\r\n\nSee 15 U.S.C. S 4406(c); S. Rep. No. 99-209, at 14, 1986\r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 13 (also stating that Smokeless Tobacco Act is\r\n\nnot intended \"to preempt a State's ability to control the\r\n\npromotion or advertising of tobacco products\"). If claims\r\n\ndirectly attacking the adequacy of package labeling and\r\n\nadvertising survive the Smokeless Tobacco Act's express\r\n\npreemption clause, then the reporting obligations under the\r\n\nDisclosure Act surely survive as well.\r\n\n          We conclude that neither the FCLAA nor the Smokeless\r\n\nTobacco Act expressly preempts the Massachusetts Disclosure\r\n\nAct.\r\n\nB.  Implied Preemption\r\n\n          1.  A Proper Inquiry?\r\n\n          Before we turn to the manufacturers' implied pre-\r\n\nemption arguments, we first address the Commonwealth's\r\n\ncontention that Cipollone precludes any preemption analysis\r\n\nbeyond the scope of the express preemption clause. In\r\n\nCipollone, the Court held that \"the pre-emptive scope of the\r\n\n1965 Act and the 1969 Act is governed entirely by the express\r\n\n[preemption] language in . . . each Act\" and explained that\r\n\n\"Congress' enactment of a provision defining the pre-emptive\r\n\nreach of a statute implies that matters beyond that reach are\r\n\n                            -51-\r                                         51\r\r\n\nnot pre-empted.\" 505 U.S. at 517. The Court further stated:\r\n\n\"In this case, the other provisions of the 1965 and 1969 Acts\r\n\noffer no cause to look beyond [the express preemption\r\n\nprovision] of each Act. Therefore, we need only identify the\r\n\ndomain expressly pre-empted by each of those sections.\" \r                                                                   Id. at\r\n\n517.\r\n\n          Subsequent to  Cipollone, the Court clarified the\r\n\nappropriate approach to implied preemption issues in cases in\r\n\nwhich express preemption language exists. In     Freightliner\r\n\nCorp. v. \r                    Myrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117918\"><a href=\"/opinion/117918/freightliner-corp-v-myrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), the Court acknowledged\r\n\nCipollone's holding \"that the pre-emptive scope of the two\r\n\nstatutes at issue was governed by the language in each act,\"\r\n\nid. at 1487, but further explained that \"[t]he fact that an\r\n\nexpress definition of the pre-emptive reach of a statute\r\n\n'implies' -- i.e., supports a reasonable inference -- that\r\n\nCongress did not intend to pre-empt other matters does not mean\r\n\nthat the express clause entirely forecloses any possibility of\r\n\nimplied pre-emption,\" \r                                 id. at 1488. Thus, the Court concluded,\r\n\n\"[a]t best, Cipollone supports an inference that an express\r\n\npre-emption clause forecloses implied pre-emption; it does not\r\n\nestablish a rule.\"  Id. at 1488.\r\n\n          In this case, the manufacturers' implied preemption\r\n\narguments are largely based on the ingredient reporting\r\n\nprovisions added to the FCLAA by the CSEA in 1984, which were\r\n\nnot at issue in Cipollone.  See 505 U.S. at 508. Thus, the\r\n\n                            -52-\r                                         52\r\r\n\nCipollone Court's refusal to look beyond the express preemption\r\n\nclauses for the purposes of analysis under the 1965 and  1969\r\n\nActs does not per se foreclose an implied preemption analysis\r\n\nbased on the 1984 amendments. Thus, while we might be tempted\r\n\nto end our preemption analysis here, we feel compelled to\r\n\nexplore the manufacturers' implied preemption theories.\r\n\n          We are bound, however, by the Cipollone majority's\r\n\nholding that S 1334(b) governs the preemptive scope of the 1965\r\n\nand 1969 Acts. Having found that the Disclosure Act falls\r\n\noutside the domain of S 1334(b), we engage in an implied\r\n\npreemption analysis only to the extent it relies on the\r\n\namendments wrought by the CSEA in 1984. In other words, we are\r\n\nnot at liberty to address any implied preemption theories based\r\n\nsolely on the FCLAA in its 1965 or 1969 versions, independent\r\n\nof the CSEA. Moreover, given that a majority of the Court has\r\n\nindicated that the FCLAA's express preemption clause implies\r\n\nthat matters outside its scope are not preempted,         see\r\n\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 517, it becomes apparent that any\r\n\nattempt to surmount the presumption against preemption of the\r\n\nstate's historic police powers under an implied preemption\r\n\ntheory faces a considerable obstacle.  See Snow, 898 F.2d at\r\n\n282 (\"The burden of overcoming th[e] presumption in favor of\r\n\nstate law is heavy in those cases that rely on implied\r\n\npreemption, which rests in turn on inference\" (internal\r\n\nquotation marks and citations omitted)).\r\n\n                            -53-\r                                         53\r\r\n\n          2.  Manufacturers' Arguments\r\n\n          As detailed above, both the FCLAA and Smokeless\r\n\nTobacco Act direct tobacco-product manufacturers to provide to\r\n\nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services an annual\r\n\ningredients list which does not identify the manufacturer or\r\n\nthe brand represented by the list, information which may be\r\n\nsubmitted aggregately by more than one manufacturer through an\r\n\nagent.   See 15 U.S.C. SS 1335a(a), 4403(a). Under both\r\n\nstatutes, the information provided is \"treated as a trade\r\n\nsecret or confidential information,\" and its unauthorized\r\n\ndisclosure is forbidden.            See SS 1335a(b)(2)(A),\r\n\n4403(b)(2)(A).  The laws further require the Secretary to\r\n\nestablish written procedures by which the information will be\r\n\nsafeguarded and specifically mandates that those procedures\r\n\ninclude certain custodial, storing, and access arrangements.\r\n\nSee SS 1335a(b)(2)(C), 4403(b)(2)(C). The manufacturers\r\n\ncontend that the Disclosure Act is impliedly preempted in light\r\n\nof these provisions combined with the structure and purpose of\r\n\nthe statutes.\r\n\n          The manufacturers do not rely, nor could they rely,\r\n\non the theory that compliance with both the Disclosure Act and\r\n\nfederal law presents a \"physical impossibility.\"  See Florida\r\n\n30.  The FCLAA additionally makes such disclosure a felony by\r\nexplicit reference to 18 U.S.C. S 1905, which criminalizes\r\nunauthorized disclosure of trade secret or confidential\r\ninformation by federal officers or employees.  See 15 U.S.C.\r\nS 1335a(b)(2)(A).\r\n\n                            -54-\r                                         54\r\r\n\nLime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc.\r                                        v. \r                                          Paul, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106601\"><a href=\"/opinion/106601/florida-lime-avocado-growers-inc-v-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143 (1963).\r\n\nRather, they contend that the Disclosure Act impermissibly\r\n\nconflicts with the purpose and objectives that underlie the\r\n\nfederal statutes. They further contend, albeit less\r\n\nelaborately, that the state law invades a field of commerce for\r\n\nwhich Congress intended exclusive federal regulation.\r\n\n          Specifically, the manufacturers argue that through\r\n\nthe FCLAA and the Smokeless Tobacco Act, Congress intended to\r\n\nestablish a careful balance between two national interests: (1)\r\n\neducating the public about the use of tobacco products and\r\n\nhealth and (2) limiting commercial burdens on the tobacco\r\n\nindustry. The ingredient reporting and safeguarding\r\n\nprovisions, they contend, further these purposes in a unique\r\n\nand exclusive manner. They reason that, while the required\r\n\ningredient lists allow Congress, with the assistance of the\r\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and its\r\n\nresearch efforts, to determine the continued adequacy of the\r\n\nmandated warning labels, nonetheless the information provided\r\n\nis kept in strict confidence through elaborate statutory\r\n\nprotections. These comprehensive provisions, the manufacturers\r\n\nclaim, limit the impact upon commerce associated with reporting\r\n\nand evaluating ingredient information.\r\n\n          The manufacturers assert that, by prescribing both an\r\n\nanonymous form of ingredient disclosure and strict safekeeping\r\n\nof the information provided, Congress intended to avoid\r\n\n                            -55-\r                                         55\r\r\n\n\"unnecessary invasion of company-specific and brand-specific\r\n\ntrade secret information.\" They contend that Congress could\r\n\nhave required full ingredient disclosure on all product labels,\r\n\nor, at the other extreme, no disclosure whatever. Instead, it\r\n\nchose a specific intermediate position which represents a\r\n\n\"precisely calibrated balance\" that, in Congress' judgment,\r\n\nbest served the public.\r\n\n          The manufacturers further contend that the anonymity\r\n\nprovided them when submitting the ingredient lists indicates\r\n\nthat the additional provisions protecting the confidentiality\r\n\nof the collected information are not merely matters of\r\n\n\"custody\" or \"internal housekeeping.\" While conceding that the\r\n\nfederal statutes do not grant the information \"trade secret\r\n\nstatus\" per se, the manufacturers nonetheless argue that, for\r\n\npreemption purposes, the exacting confidentiality provisions\r\n\nreflect Congress' concern for the potential loss of commercial\r\n\nadvantage, which itself is part and parcel of Congress' broader\r\n\nintent to protect commerce and the national economy.\r\n\n          According to the manufacturers, enforcement of the\r\n\nDisclosure Act's obligations to disclose brand-specific and\r\n\ncompany-specific ingredient information, without guarantees of\r\n\nconfidentiality, would frustrate the purposes of the FCLAA and\r\n\nSmokeless Tobacco Act. They contend that the federal statutes'\r\n\nintricate information-safekeeping provisions \"would be utterly\r\n\npointless\" if a state were permitted to make publicly available\r\n\n                            -56-\r                                         56\r\r\n\ninformation that the federal government may not even collect,\r\n\nmuch less reveal. Moreover, they claim, it would be \"absurd\"\r\n\nfor the HHS Secretary to continue to collect the federally\r\n\nprescribed ingredient information when even more precise, brand\r\n\nspecific information collected pursuant to the Disclosure Act\r\n\nwould be readily available. Because Congress carefully limited\r\n\nthe collection and disclosure of cigarette ingredients in\r\n\nfurtherance of the balance between health education and trade\r\n\nprotection, they argue, collection and disclosure of the type\r\n\ncontemplated by the Disclosure Act would \"stand[] as an\r\n\nobstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full\r\n\npurposes and objectives of Congress.\" \r                                                 Hines v. \r                                                          Davidowitz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103438\"><a href=\"/opinion/103438/hines-v-davidowitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span>\r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1941). They further assert that the comprehensive\r\n\nmanner in which Congress dealt with the health concern posed by\r\n\ntobacco-product additives shows its intent to obtain uniformity\r\n\nin ingredient disclosure requirements, supplanting any\r\n\nsupplemental state efforts, such as the Disclosure Act, in the\r\n\narea.\r\n\n          The manufacturers also offer a closely related\r\n\nargument: the Disclosure Act intrudes into a \"field,\" albeit a\r\n\nnarrow one, that Congress intended federal law to occupy\r\n\nexclusively. To this end, they assert that the HHS Secretary's\r\n\nrole to review cigarette ingredients from a health standpoint,\r\n\nthe stringent confidentiality procedures, and the balance of\r\n\nnational interests \"evince Congress' intent to occupy the field\r\n\n                            -57-\r                                         57\r\r\n\nof cigarette ingredient reporting, monitoring and review.\" In\r\n\nsum, they argue that the very comprehensiveness, complexity,\r\n\nand specificity of the federal reporting provisions evince a\r\n\nfederal dominance and pervasiveness in ingredient reporting and\r\n\ndisclosure that allows no room for supplemental state laws such\r\n\nas the Disclosure Act. Ultimately, we find the manufacturers'\r\n\narguments unpersuasive.\r\n\n          3.

Although the Smokeless Tobacco Act does not contain a\r\nS 1331 counterpart, the smokeless tobacco manufacturers seek to\r\navail themselves of arguments related to this section because\r\n\n                            -59-\r                                         59\r\r\n\n          The manufacturers' implied preemption arguments rely\r\n\nheavily on select phrases from S 1331 and on certain language\r\n\nin our pre-Cipollone decision, Palmer v.

In   Palmer, we expansively interpreted\r\n\nS 1331 and declared that, in passing the FCLAA, Congress sought\r\n\n\"to strike a fair, effective balance between . . . two\r\n\ncompeting interests\": \"health protection (through education)\r\n\nand trade protection.\" Id. at 626. We observed, \"Congress ran\r\n\na hard-fought, bitterly partisan battle in striking the\r\n\ncompromise that became the [FCLAA].

See\r\n\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 511.  None of the court's opinions,\r\n\nhowever, either affirmed or elaborated upon this theory.\r\n\nRather, a majority of the Court agreed that the two purposes\r\n\nexpressed in S 1331 were \"(1) adequately informing the public\r\n\n[of any adverse health effects of smoking\r                                                    ], and (2) protecting\r\n\nthe national economy  from  \r                                        the  \r                                             burden  \r                                                    imposed  \r                                                             by  \r                                                                 diverse,\r\n\nnonuniform, \r                        and \r                            confusing \r                                      cigarette \r                                                labeling \r                                                         and \r                                                              advertising\r\n\nregulations.\" 505 U.S. at 514 (emphasis added).

See Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 508 n.2.\r\n\n34.  We modify the Court's language here in light of the 1984\r\namendment to S 1331(1) reflecting the new rotating warning\r\nsystem. \r\n\n                            -61-\r                                         61\r\r\n\noverarching \"balance\" from which an expansive domain of\r\n\npreemption might flow.\r\n\n          The Court's evident rejection of the lower court's\r\n\n\"balance of national interests theory\" is reflected in the\r\n\nCourt's refusal to engage in an implied preemption analysis\r\n\neven as to those claims not expressly preempted. Had the Court\r\n\nbeen inclined to recognize and give preemptive effect to the\r\n\nasserted balance, it might have found preempted the surviving\r\n\nfailure-to-warn and fraudulent misrepresentation claims which,\r\n\nif successful, would certainly inflict a burden upon the\r\n\ntobacco trade. Instead, the Court recognized the limited\r\n\npurpose of avoiding the burden on the national economy\r\n\nspecifically posed by nonuniform labeling and advertising\r\n\nregulations.  Moreover, the Court indicated that Congress\r\n\n35.  As indicated earlier, the \r                                          Cipollone Court did not address\r\nthe CSEA and its amendments to the FCLAA. We see no reason,\r\nhowever, why the CSEA would change the Court's interpretation\r\nof the text of S 1331(2), which has never been amended,\r\nregarding the nature of the burden to the national economy\r\nsought to be avoided under the FCLAA. While the CSEA\r\nnecessarily furthers the congressional purposes expressed in\r\nS 1331, nothing in the 1984 amendments suggests that it alters\r\nthe scope of the protected interest expressed in S 1331(2), as\r\ninterpreted by the Court in Cipollone.\r\n\n36.  At this point, we will not speculate as to the nature and\r\ncharacter of the burden created should other states impose\r\ndiffering reporting requirements.  See English 496 U.S. at 90\r\n(finding certain imagined prospects \"simply too speculative a\r\nbasis on which to rest a finding of pre-emption\"). Although\r\nthe cigarette manufacturers cite dozens of pending tobacco-\r\ndisclosure bills in state legislatures, even if we assume the\r\nbills will become law, see Minn. H.F. 117 S 5, the resulting\r\nburden is qualitatively different, and seemingly significantly\r\nlesser, than that created by varying warning requirements in\r\n\n                            -62-\r                                         62\r\r\n\naddressed this concern largely, if not solely, through the\r\n\nexpress preemption clause, which we have addressed above. See\r\n\nCipollone, 505 U.S. at 514; see also S. Rep. No. 91-566, 1970\r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 2663 (explaining that preemption clause was\r\n\nnecessary \"to avoid the chaos created by a multiplicity of\r\n\nconflicting [cigarette advertising] regulations\").\r\n\n          We cannot ignore the \r                                          Cipollone majority's reading of\r\n\nthe congressional purpose evinced in S 1331, which is\r\n\nconsiderably more limited than our enunciation in Palmer and\r\n\nthe manufacturers' current contentions. Given the Court's\r\n\nnarrower interpretation, we conclude that the Disclosure Act\r\n\ndoes not impede either purpose expressed in S 1331 because it\r\n\nneither obstructs the congressionally mandated warning labels,\r\n\nnor (for the reasons expressed previously) impedes the national\r\n\neconomy by imposing a diverse or nonuniform advertising\r\n\nregulation. Although S 1331 may express some general concern\r\n\nfor protecting commerce and the national economy, we will not\r\n\nfind preemption where a state law merely creates some general\r\n\ntension with a federal law's abstract objectives.

Indeed, had Congress intended to protect\r\n\nthe tobacco industry from negative state action generally, then\r\n\nsurviving police regulations, such as prohibitions on smoking\r\n\nin public buildings or on tobacco use by minors, or state\r\n\ntaxation, would also be preempted.  See S. Rep. 91-566, 1970\r\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 2663.\r\n\n          Having found that the purported general national\r\n\npolicy does not yield a special statutory feature that warrants\r\n\npreemption, we turn to specific statutory provisions with which\r\n\nthe Disclosure Act allegedly conflicts. Cf. \r                                                        Montana, 453 U.S.\r\n\nat 634.\r\n\n               b. Conflict with Federal Reporting Provisions?\r\n\n          The manufacturers contend that the Disclosure Act\r\n\nconflicts with, and effectively \"repeals,\" Congress' carefully\r\n\nwrought ingredient reporting scheme. They argue that the\r\n\nfederal anonymity and confidentiality protections show\r\n\ncongressional intent to oust state laws such as the Disclosure\r\n\nAct, which demand product-specific and brand-specific\r\n\ninformation without protection of confidentiality. Normally,\r\n\nhowever, state laws are not preempted \"'solely because they\r\n\nimpose liability over and above that authorized by federal\r\n\nlaw.'\" English, 496 U.S. at 89 (quoting \r                                                    California v. \r                                                                  ARC Am.\r\n\nCorp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112245\"><a href=\"/opinion/112245/california-v-arc-america-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 105 (1989)). Rather, we must find \"some\r\n\nspecific suggestion in the text or legislative history\" of the\r\n\n                            -64-\r                                         64\r\r\n\nallegedly preempting federal law to conclude that Congress\r\n\nintended to preempt additional state liabilities.  Id.\r\n\n          On their face, the FCLAA and Smokeless Tobacco Act do\r\n\nnot protect generally the confidentiality of tobacco-industry\r\n\ningredient information. Rather, they secure only \"information\r\n\nprovided to the Secretary under [the reporting provisions].\"\r\n\n15 U.S.C. SS 1335a(b)(2)(A), 4403(b)(2)(A). By like token, the\r\n\nprovisions mandating the Secretary to establish confidentiality\r\n\nprocedures, while notable for their specificity, apply only to\r\n\nthe information provided to her under the statutes.       See\r\n\nSS 1335a(b)(2)(C), 4403(b)(2)(C). Furthermore, as the\r\n\nmanufacturers concede, the statutes do not confer \"trade\r\n\nsecret\" or \"confidential\" status upon the information, but only\r\n\n\"treat[]\" it as such.  Id.\r\n\n          While the statutes strictly forbid unauthorized\r\n\ndisclosure, the proscriptions govern the conduct of only\r\n\ncertain federal officers or employees. For example, the laws\r\n\nbestow upon the collected information the benefit of the trade\r\n\nsecrets exemption in the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\").\r\n\nSee 5 U.S.C. S 552(b)(4). The FOIA, however, by its own terms,\r\n\napplies only to federal executive branch agencies.     See 5\r\n\nU.S.C. SS 551(1), 552(a). Thus, HHS employees and other\r\n\nfederal employees need not make publicly available the\r\n\n37.  The proscriptions against disclosure are subject to any\r\nrequest by a congressional committee or subcommittee.  See 15\r\nU.S.C. SS 1335a(b)(2)(B), 4403(b)(2)(B).\r\n\n                            -65-\r                                         65\r\r\n\ncollected information under the FOIA, but the exemption would\r\n\nnot inhibit the conduct of state agencies possessing such\r\n\ninformation, which are not governed by the FOIA in the first\r\n\ninstance. The FCLAA further indicates Congress' strong intent\r\n\nto ensure the confidentiality of the collected information by\r\n\nincorporation of 18 U.S.C. S 1905, which criminalizes\r\n\nunauthorized disclosure of confidential or trade secret\r\n\ninformation. Again, section 1905 itself applies only to \"an\r\n\nofficer or employee of the United States or of any department\r\n\nor agency thereof\" and certain other persons not implicated\r\n\nhere.  Id.\r\n\n          Moreover, the legislative histories referencing the\r\n\nreporting provisions make little or no mention of the ancillary\r\n\nconfidentiality protections and certainly do not reveal any\r\n\nintent generally to safeguard industry ingredient-information\r\n\noutside of the lists provided to the Secretary. With regard to\r\n\nthe reporting provision in the CSEA, House Report 805\r\n\naccompanying the CSEA explains only that it \"would permit the\r\n\nfederal government to initiate the toxicologic research\r\n\nnecessary to measure any health risk posed by additives and\r\n\nother ingredients to cigarettes during the manufacturing\r\n\nprocess.\" H.R. Rep. No. 98-805, at 21, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\r\n\n3734. Senate Report 209 accompanying the Smokeless Tobacco Act\r\n\nstates only that the provision \"is included to further the\r\n\naccumulation of knowledge about the health risks of smokeless\r\n\n                            -66-\r                                         66\r\r\n\ntobacco use, particularly the possible hazards of substances\r\n\nadded to tobacco to enhance flavor and for other purposes.\" S.\r\n\nRep. No. 99-209 at 14, 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. p. 13. The reports\r\n\nneither discuss nor elaborate upon the purpose of the\r\n\nconfidentiality protections.\r\n\n          The textual and historical indications lead to the\r\n\nconclusion that Congress primarily intended the reporting\r\n\nprovisions in the FCLAA and Smokeless Tobacco Act to further\r\n\ntoxicological research. By \"treat[ing]\" the collected\r\n\ninformation as a \"trade secret\" or \"confidential,\" the statutes\r\n\nfurther the primary research objective in a meaningful, but\r\n\nlimited, way: facilitating ready access to the ingredient\r\n\ninformation required for research purposes by assuring the\r\n\ntobacco industry that any trade secret interests in the\r\n\ninformation provided to the Secretary will be safeguarded.\r                                                                      In\r\n\nour view, the fact that Congress took great care to safeguard\r\n\nreported ingredient information at most indicates that Congress\r\n\npresumed the information's confidential nature for the purposes\r\n\nof its regime. Perhaps Congress even assumed that there was no\r\n\nquestion as to the trade secret status of the ingredient\r\n\ninformation. Underlying assumptions, however, do not merit\r\n\npreemptive force; legislative enactments do. Our review of the\r\n\n38.  Furthermore, the mere fact that Congress found an\r\naggregate form of ingredients disclosure sufficient for its\r\npurposes is no indication that increased state requirements\r\nwould conflict with its own scheme.\r\n\n                            -67-\r                                         67\r\r\n\nstatutory text and legislative history does not yield the\r\n\nrequisite clear and manifest congressional intent to speak\r\n\nnationally and finally on the general confidential status of\r\n\ntobacco-product ingredients.\r\n\n          Thus, while Congress proceeded expeditiously with its\r\n\nhealth research objectives by treating the ingredient\r\n\ninformation as a trade secret, it did not thereby preempt\r\n\nStates from otherwise lawfully obtaining (or attempting to\r\n\nobtain) such information. Moreover, that Congress did not\r\n\nintend through the FCLAA and Smokeless Tobacco Act nationally\r\n\nto protect all tobacco-product ingredients information does not\r\n\nnecessarily force the manufacturers to reveal their purported\r\n\ntrade secrets. The manufacturers may well have valid trade\r\n\nsecret interests that are threatened by the Disclosure Act.\r\n\nThe actual merit of any trade secret claim, however, is not\r\n\nbefore us now, and we are not at liberty to speculate as to the\r\n\n39.  We are thus unpersuaded by the manufacturers' citation of\r\nisolated bits of hearing testimony referring to the CSEA's\r\nprotection of \"trade secret\" ingredient information. \r                                                                See \r                                                                    e.g.,\r\n130 Cong.

Costs to Appellees.\r\n\nMassachusetts has no special or unique interest and that, by\r\nits very nature, it will necessarily have nationwide impact\r\nthereby contradicting a policy decision made for the nation by\r\nCongress. To the extent this argument touches upon the\r\n\"balance of national interests\" theory, we have disposed of\r\nthat above for the purposes of preemption analysis. To the\r\nextent the argument touches upon any Commerce Clause claims,\r\nsee generally Hyde Park, 825 F.2d at 843-48, the issue is not\r\nproperly before us here.\r\n\n                            -77-\r                                         77\r\r\n\n                         Appendix A\r\n\nIn its entirety, the Massachusetts Disclosure Act provides:\r\n\nS 307B. Manufacture of tobacco products; annual reports\r\nincluding added constituents and nicotine yield ratings;\r\ndisclosure; exclusions\r\n\n          For the purpose of protecting the public health, any\r\nmanufacturer of cigarettes, snuff or chewing tobacco sold in\r\nthe commonwealth shall provide the department of public health\r\nwith an annual report, in a form and at a time specified by\r\nthat department, which lists for each brand of such product\r\nsold the following information:\r\n\n(a) The identity of any added constituent other than tobacco,\r\nwater or reconstituted tobacco sheet made wholly from tobacco,\r\nto be listed in descending order according to weight, measure,\r\nor numerical count; and\r\n\n(b) The nicotine yield ratings, which shall accurately predict\r\nnicotine intake for average consumers, based on standards to be\r\nestablished by the department of public health.\r\n\n          The nicotine yield ratings so provided, and any other\r\nsuch information in the annual reports with respect to which\r\nthe department determines that there is a reasonable scientific\r\nbasis for concluding that the availability of such information\r\ncould reduce risks to public health, shall be public records;\r\nprovided, however, that before any public disclosure of such\r\ninformation the department shall request the advice of the\r\nattorney general whether such disclosure would constitute an\r\nunconstitutional taking of property, and shall not disclose\r\nsuch information unless and until the attorney general advises\r\nthat such disclosure would not constitute an unconstitutional\r\ntaking.\r\n          This section shall not require a manufacturer, in its\r\nreport to the department or otherwise, to identify or disclose\r\nthe specific amount of any ingredient that has been approved by\r\nthe Food and Drug Administration, Public Health Service, United\r\nStates Department of Health and Human Services (\"FDA\"), or its\r\nsuccessor agency, as safe when burned and inhaled or that has\r\nbeen designated by the FDA, or its successor agency, as\r\ngenerally recognized as safe when burned and inhaled, according\r\nto the Generally Recognized As Safe list of the FDA.\r\n\nMass.
