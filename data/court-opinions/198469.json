Defendant-appellant Ralph P.\nAmelia appeals the district court's entry of judgment against him\nin this fraudulent conveyance action.  After considering Amelia's\narguments, we affirm.\n                             I.\nThis case finds its genesis in a number of loans issued\nby Vanguard Savings Bank to Felix J. Pittorino from 1989 to 1991. \nSeveral of the loans were guarantied by property of Pigeon Hill\nEstates Trust (\"Pigeon Hill Trust\"), for which Pittorino and Amelia\nwere trustees.  Vanguard went into receivership in March 1992, and\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") was appointed\nliquidating agent.  Then, in November 1995, the FDIC assigned its\nVanguard loans to plaintiff-appellee Beal Bank.  On March 22, 1996,\nBeal Bank sued Pittorino individually, Pittorino and Amelia as\ntrustees of Pigeon Hill Trust, and other related entities to\ncollect on the unpaid loans.\nThe 1996 action was bifurcated: the claims against\nPittorino individually were severed from the claims against\nPittorino and Amelia as trustees.  The former were tried before a\njury.  On April 8, 1996, the jury returned a verdict against\nPittorino in the amount of $7.8 million.  The trial against\nPittorino and Amelia as trustees was scheduled to begin on\nSeptember 17, 1996.  Prior to that date, the trustees entered\nsettlement negotiations with Beal Bank and reported to the district\ncourt that they had agreed to a settlement.  The court memorialized\nthe parties' settlement agreement by entering a January 7, 1997\njudgment directing Pigeon Hill Trust to pay Beal Bank $3 million.\nAfter entry of the final order, Beal Bank initiated Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 69 discovery upon judgment defendants Pittorino and the\ntrustees of Pigeon Hill Trust.  Through discovery, Beal Bank\nlearned that Pittorino and Amelia had transferred the bulk of\nPigeon Hill Trusts's assets to Pitt Construction Corporation\n(\"Pitt\") and ALA Realty Trust (\"ALA\").  Pittorino was the\npresident, treasurer, and controlling shareholder of Pitt.  Amelia\nwas the sole trustee of ALA, and his wife was the sole beneficiary. \nThese transfers occurred on May 10, 1996, after the jury verdict\nhad been rendered against Pittorino and while the claims against\nPittorino and Amelia as trustees were still pending.\nAlleging that the May 10 conveyances were fraudulent and\ntherefore voidable under Massachusetts law, on April 28, 1997, Beal\nBank filed the instant action against Pigeon Hill Trust, Pittorino,\nand Amelia.\nOn June 6, 1997, Beal Bank moved for summary judgment. \nAfter a hearing, the court granted summary judgment with respect to\nAmelia's defense of estoppel, ordered a jury trial with respect to\nAmelia's defense of mutual mistake, and ordered a bench trial with\nrespect to the remainder of the fraudulent conveyance claim.  The\njury rejected Amelia's mutual mistake defense, and, after the bench\ntrial, the district court ordered the conveyances set aside as\nfraudulent.\nOn appeal, Amelia essentially contends that the district\ncourt (1) erred in awarding Beal Bank summary judgment on its\nestoppel defense; (2) made a number of errors in its application of\nMassachusetts's fraudulent conveyance statute; and (3) delivered an\nerroneous jury instruction.  We consider each argument in turn.\n                            II.\n                             A\nAmelia alleges that the district court, during a hearing\non Beal Bank's summary judgment motion, improperly \"str[uck]\nvarious standard contract defenses.\"  Yet, the only defense\ndiscussed in Amelia's brief is the defense of estoppel.  Therefore,\nwe consider only whether the district court erred in striking this\ndefense.  All other arguments have been waived.  See King v. Town\nof Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 970 (1st Cir. 1997) (stating that\nundeveloped arguments are waived).\nA district court may dispose of a particular claim or\ndefense by summary judgment when one of the parties is entitled to\njudgment as a matter of law on that claim or defense.  See, e.g.,\nFDIC v. LeBlanc, 85 F.3d 815, 820-21 (1st Cir. 1996).  We review\nthe district court's ruling de novo, see Terry v. Bayer Corp., 145\nF.3d 28, 34 (1st Cir. 1998), drawing all inferences in the light\nmost favorable to Amelia, see LeBlanc, 85 F.3d at 817.\nThe basis for Amelia's argument that Beal Bank should be\nestopped from enforcing the guaranty on the Pittorino loans seems\nto be that: (1) the FDIC (Beal Bank's predecessor in interest) had\nstated that it would not enforce the guaranty against Pigeon Hill\nTrust; (2) based on this statement, Amelia expended legal fees\nlitigating an earlier state court action against Pittorino to\nobtain an equity interest in the Pigeon Hill Trust property; and\n(3) Amelia therefore suffered a detriment as a result of the FDIC's\nrepresentations.  Cf. Clickner v. City of Lowell, 422 Mass. 539,\n544 (1996) (setting forth the elements of the estoppel defense).  \nBecause the FDIC's alleged statement was not committed to\nwriting, it cannot form the basis for an estoppel defense.  See\nD'Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.S. 447 (1942); 12 U.S.C.\n1823(e).  The D'Oench, Duhme doctrine prevents a party from\nasserting an oral agreement as the basis for either a claim or\ndefense against the FDIC, see LeBlanc, 85 F.3d at 821, or against\nany of its assignees, see NCNB Texas Nat. Bank v. Johnson, 11 F.3d\n1260, 1268 (5th Cir. 1994); Community Bank of the Ozarks v. FDIC,\n984 F.2d 254, 257 (8th Cir. 1993); UMLIC-Nine Corp. v. Lipan\nSprings Dev. Corp., 168 F.3d 1173, 1179 (10th Cir. 1999). \nSimilarly, section 1823(e) \"bars anyone from asserting against the\nFDIC any 'agreement' that is not in writing and is not properly\nrecorded in the records of the bank.\"  LeBlanc, 85 F.3d at 821.\nDuring the hearing, the court asked counsel whether\nAmelia had any document memorializing the alleged agreement by the\nFDIC.  Amelia introduced an affidavit that had been executed by an\nattorney for the FDIC, which stated that there existed an internal\nmemorandum from the FDIC legal department to the credit file\nindicating that the legal department had determined the guaranty to\nbe void because of a mutual mistake.  Neither the affidavit nor the\nmemorandum, however, constitutes an agreement that the FDIC would\nnot enforce the guaranty against Pigeon Hill Trust.  Nor do they\nsatisfy the other requirements of section 1823(e).  See 12 U.S.C.\n1823(e).  The district court thus correctly entered summary\njudgment on Amelia's estoppel defense.\n                             B\nAmelia also contends that the court, during the bench\ntrial, made two errors in its application of the Massachusetts\nfraudulent conveyance statute.  Amelia's first argument, that the\ncourt erred by applying the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act\n(\"UFCA\"), see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A (West 1990) (repealed),\nrather than the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"UFTA\"), see Mass.\nGen. Laws ch. 109A (effective Oct. 8, 1996), has no merit.  The\ntransfers occurred on May 10, 1996.  The case therefore is governed\nby the UFCA, which was in effect at that time.  See First Federal\nSavings &amp; Loan Ass'n of Galion, OH v. Napoleon, 428 Mass. 371, 373\n(1998) (holding that the UFTA does not apply retroactively to\ntransfers that occurred before its effective date).  \nAmelia's second argument, that the district court erred\nin finding that the May 10 conveyances were made with an actual\nintent to defraud Beal Bank, also fails.  A finding of fraudulent\nintent is a finding of fact, which we will not disturb absent clear\nerror.  See Max Sugarman Funeral Home, Inc. v. ADB Investors, 926\nF.2d 1248, 1255 (1st Cir. 1991).  We find no clear error here.\nUnder the UFCA, a \"conveyance made . . . with actual\nintent . . . to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future\ncreditors, is fraudulent.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 109A,  7.  It is\nthe rare case in which a transferor admits that he intended to make\nan impermissible transfer.  Thus, courts often infer fraudulent\nintent by considering certain \"badges of fraud,\" the most common of\nwhich are\n  (1) actual or threatened litigation against\nthe debtor; (2) a purported transfer of all or\nsubstantially all of the debtor's property;\n(3) insolvency or other unmanageable\nindebtedness on the part of the debtor; (4) a\nspecial relationship between the debtor and\nthe transferee; and (5) retention by the\ndebtor of the property involved in the\nputative transfer.\n\nPalmer v. Murphy, 42 Mass. App. Ct. 334, 345-46 (1997) (citing FDIC\nv. Anchor Properties, 13 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 1994) (interpreting\nthe UFCA)).  \"The presence of a single badge of fraud may spur mere\nsuspicion, the confluence of several can constitute conclusive\nevidence of an actual intent to defraud.\"  Max Sugarman Funeral\nHome, Inc., 926 F.2d at 1254-55; accord Anchor Properties, 13 F.3d\nat 32.\nThe May 10 conveyances show each of these common badges\nof fraud.  They occurred after a jury had rendered a $7.8 million\nverdict against Pittorino and while the claims against Amelia and\nPittorino as trustees were still pending.  Thus, the trustees faced \nactual litigation in which their co-defendant had already been held\nliable.  Next, it is undisputed that Pittorino and Amelia\ntransferred almost all of the trust property.  The conveyances\ntherefore constituted a \"transfer of all or substantially all of\n[debtor Pigeon Hill Trust's] property.\"  Third, the transfers left\nPigeon Hill Trust with little-to-no assets, yet potentially liable\nfor the outstanding guaranty on the unpaid Pittorino loans.  This\nconstitutes de facto \"insolvency or other unmanageable\nindebtedness.\"  Fourth, it is undisputed that there was a special\nrelationship between the transferors and the transferees: Pittorino\nis the controlling shareholder of Pitt, while Amelia and his wife\nare respectively the sole trustee and beneficiary of ALA.  For that\nsame reason, the trustees retained control over the property\ninvolved in the putative transfer, thereby constituting a fifth\nbadge of fraud.  The district court's finding of fraudulent intent\nis affirmed.\n                             C\nFinally, Amelia assigns error to a jury instruction given\nat the conclusion of the trial on his mutual mistake defense.  That\ninstruction related to one John Driscoll, whom Michael Oleksak, the\nloan officer for Vanguard, testified had been counsel to Vanguard\nand had drafted the guaranty in question.  The court instructed the\njury:\n  But also there's Mr. Driscoll.  If you believe\nthe testimony, Mr. Driscoll was also an agent\nof the bank.  Mr. Driscoll was the lawyer on\nbehalf of the bank.  Were the papers, if you\nbelieve the testimony about the drafting of\nthe papers, were these papers drafted the way\nthe bank wanted them drafted?  Or, has Mr.\nAmelia proved that in fact there was a mistake\non the part of the bank and that mistake was\nmutual, was the same as the mistake Mr. Amelia\nmade when he signed the papers.\n\nCiting Devaux v. American Home Assurance Co., 387 Mass. 814 (1983)\nand a treatise on legal malpractice, Amelia contends that the\ncourt's instruction \"reflects a misunderstanding of basic agency\nlaw,\" because \"[a] lawyer cannot be an agent of his client unless\nthere is express authorization for such conduct.\"  Then, swiftly\nchanging course and without citing to any relevant authority,\nAmelia argues that the jury instruction somehow amounts to an\nerroneous judgment as a matter of law: \"the role of the attorney\nwas defined for [the jury] . . . [when] the jury and not the judge\nis to decide such a matter.\" \nNeither of these arguments were preserved for appeal\nbecause Amelia did not properly note his objection in the court\nbelow.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51 states, in relevant\npart, that \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or the\nfailure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto\nbefore the jury retires to consider its verdict.\"  Although counsel\nfor Amelia argued during the charge conference that there was no\nevidence that attorney Driscoll was an agent for the bank   an\nargument different from the two arguably being made on appeal  \nthis objection was insufficient to preserve the issue because\ncounsel failed to renew the objection after the district court\ndelivered the jury charge.  \"[I]t is an ironclad rule in this\ncircuit that failure to renew objections after the charge\nconstitutes waiver of any claim of error.\"  Wilson v. Maritime\nOverseas Corp., 150 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1998).   We therefore\nreview for plain error only.  See Play Time, Inc. v. LDDS\nMetromedia Communications, Inc., 123 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir. 1997). \nFinding no plain error, we affirm.  See id. (stating that reversal\nunder plain error standard requires a showing that the alleged\nerror \"caused a miscarriage of justice or . . . undermined the\nintegrity of the judicial process\").\n                             D\nPeppered throughout Amelia's briefs are vague and cryptic\nreferences to other alleged deficiencies in the lower court\nproceedings.  As we noted during oral argument, these theories are\npoorly presented and exceedingly confused.  It is well-established\nthat\n  issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner,\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived . . . . It is\nnot enough merely to mention a possible\nargument in the most skeletal way, leaving the\ncourt to do counsel's work . . . . Judges are\nnot expected to be mindreaders.  Consequently,\na litigant has an obligation to spell out its\narguments squarely and distinctly, or else\nforever hold its peace.\n\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (internal\nquotation marks and citations omitted).  We have done our best to\nglean from the unusually opaque appellant's briefs those legal\narguments that have been even marginally developed.  We have\nconsidered only those arguments.  The rest of Amelia's arguments\nare waived.\n                            III.\nThe decision of the district court is affirmed.  Costs to\nappellees.\n",

A finding of fraudulent intent is a finding of fact, which we will not disturb absent clear error.  See Max Sugarman Funeral Home, Inc. v. ADB Investors, 926 F.2d 1248, 1255 (1st Cir.1991).

Gen. Laws ch.  109A, &#167; 7.  It is the rare case in which a transferor admits that he intended to make an impermissible transfer.  Thus, courts often infer fraudulent intent by considering certain \"badges of fraud,\" the most common of which are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) actual or threatened litigation against the debtor;  (2) a purported transfer of all or substantially all of the debtor's property;  (3) insolvency or other unmanageable indebtedness on the part of the debtor;  (4) a special relationship between the debtor and the transferee;  and (5) retention by the debtor of the property involved in the putative transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Palmer v.

They occurred after a jury had rendered a $7.8 million verdict against Pittorino and while the claims against Amelia and Pittorino as trustees were still pending.  Thus, the trustees faced actual litigation in which their co-defendant had already been held liable.  Next, it is undisputed that Pittorino and Amelia transferred almost all of the trust property.  The conveyances therefore constituted a \"transfer of all or substantially all of [debtor Pigeon Hill Trust's] property.\"   Third, the transfers left Pigeon Hill Trust with little-to-no assets, yet potentially liable for the outstanding guaranty on the unpaid Pittorino loans.  This constitutes de facto \"insolvency or other unmanageable indebtedness.\"   Fourth, it is undisputed that there was a special relationship between the transferors and the transferees:  Pittorino is the controlling shareholder of Pitt, while Amelia and his wife are respectively the sole trustee and beneficiary of ALA.  For that same reason, the trustees retained control over the property involved in the putative transfer, thereby constituting a fifth badge of fraud.  The district court's finding of fraudulent intent is affirmed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Amelia assigns error to a jury instruction given at the conclusion of the trial on his mutual mistake defense.  That instruction related to one John Driscoll, whom Michael Oleksak, the loan officer for Vanguard, testified had been counsel to Vanguard and had drafted the guaranty in question.

If you believe the testimony, Mr. Driscoll was also an agent of the bank.  Mr. Driscoll was the lawyer on behalf of the bank.  Were the papers, if you believe the testimony about the drafting of the papers, were these papers drafted the way the bank wanted them drafted?   Or, has Mr. Amelia proved that in fact there was a mistake on the part of the bank and that mistake was mutual, was the same as the mistake Mr. Amelia made when he signed the papers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing DeVaux v.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51 states, in relevant part, that \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict.\"   Although counsel for Amelia argued during the charge conference that there was no evidence that attorney Driscoll was an agent for the bank--an argument different from the two arguably being made on appeal--this objection was insufficient to preserve the issue because counsel failed to renew the objection after the district court delivered the jury charge.  \"[I]t is an ironclad rule in this circuit that failure to renew objections after the charge constitutes waiver of any claim of error.\"  Wilson v. Maritime Overseas Corp., 150 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.1998).  We therefore review for plain error only.  See Play Time, Inc. v. LDDS Metromedia Communications, Inc., 123 F.3d 23, 29 (1st Cir.1997).

This statement is inaccurate and misleading.  During the conference, Amelia's counsel did make the following cryptic remarks:  \"The FDIC then issued a decision that they investigated the unlimited guaranty [the guaranty at issue here], determined it to be of no legal effect and that therefore your discharge shall be coming.\"   In response to this proffer, the court immediately asked whether there was any documentary evidence rescinding Pigeon Hill Trusts' obligations on the guaranty.

As if to support this contention, eleven pages of the brief are devoted to describing a series of transactions that occurred after the May 10, 1996 conveyances.  This description appears in a section entitled \"Statement of Real Estate Transfers Relevant to the Parties of the Case.\"  Amelia's counsel, however, admitted during oral argument that these conveyances are irrelevant to the instant action</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The other arguments made by Amelia regarding the court's application of the UFCA are hopelessly confused.  Initially, Amelia contends that the district court misapplied the UFCA by failing to find either actual or constructive fraud.  See Appellant's Br. at 25 (\"The judge in this case did not find that Mr. Amelia committed actual fraud or constructive fraud.\").  Later in the same brief, however, Amelia seems to admit that the district court found both actual and constructive fraud since he challenges these findings as erroneous.  See Appellant's Br. at 26-37.  Because we find that the district court correctly found actual fraud, and because a conveyance may be set aside under a finding of either actual or constructive fraud, we affirm without addressing Amelia's claims that the district court's finding of constructive fraud is erroneous</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The issue before the court in DeVaux was whether a secretary of a law firm had actual or implied authority to establish an attorney-client relationship on behalf of the law firm.

Pittorino from 1989 to 1991.  Several of the loans were guarantied by property of Pigeon Hill Estates Trust (\"Pigeon Hill Trust\"), for which Pittorino and Amelia were trustees.  Vanguard went into receivership in March 1992, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\"FDIC\") was appointed liquidating agent.  Then, in November 1995, the FDIC assigned its Vanguard loans to plaintiff-appellee Beal Bank.  On March 22, 1996, Beal Bank sued Pittorino individually, Pittorino and Amelia as trustees of Pigeon Hill Trust, and other related entities to collect on the unpaid loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1996 action was bifurcated:  the claims against Pittorino individually were severed from the claims against Pittorino and Amelia as trustees.  The former were tried before a jury.  On April 8, 1996, the jury returned a verdict against Pittorino in the amount of $7.8 million.  The trial against Pittorino and Amelia as trustees was scheduled to begin on September 17, 1996.  Prior to that date, the trustees entered settlement negotiations with Beal Bank and reported to the district court that they had agreed to a settlement.  The court memorialized the parties' settlement agreement by entering a January 7, 1997 judgment directing Pigeon Hill Trust to pay Beal Bank $3 million.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After entry of the final order, Beal Bank initiated Fed.R.Civ.P. 69 discovery upon judgment defendants Pittorino and the trustees of Pigeon Hill Trust.  Through discovery, Beal Bank learned that Pittorino and Amelia had transferred the bulk of Pigeon Hill Trusts's assets to Pitt Construction Corporation (\"Pitt\") and ALA Realty Trust (\"ALA\").  Pittorino was the president, treasurer, and controlling shareholder of Pitt.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Amelia was the sole trustee of ALA, and his wife was the sole beneficiary.  These transfers occurred on May 10, 1996, after the jury verdict had been rendered against Pittorino and while the claims against Pittorino and Amelia as trustees were still pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alleging that the May 10 conveyances were fraudulent and therefore voidable under Massachusetts law, on April 28, 1997, Beal Bank filed the instant action against Pigeon Hill Trust, Pittorino, and Amelia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 6, 1997, Beal Bank moved for summary judgment.  After a hearing, the court granted summary judgment with respect to Amelia's defense of estoppel, ordered a jury trial with respect to Amelia's defense of mutual mistake, and ordered a bench trial with respect to the remainder of the fraudulent conveyance claim.  The jury rejected Amelia's mutual mistake defense, and, after the bench trial, the district court ordered the conveyances set aside as fraudulent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Amelia essentially contends that the district court (1) erred in awarding Beal Bank summary judgment on his estoppel defense;  (2) made a number of errors in its application of Massachusetts's fraudulent conveyance statute;  and (3) delivered an erroneous jury instruction.

Amelia introduced an affidavit that had been executed by an attorney for the FDIC, which stated that there existed an internal memorandum from the FDIC legal department to the credit file indicating that the legal department had determined the guaranty to be void because of a mutual mistake.  Neither the affidavit nor the memorandum, however, constitutes an agreement that the FDIC would not enforce the guaranty against Pigeon Hill Trust.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Nor do they satisfy the other requirements of section 1823(e).  See 12 U.S.C. &#167; 1823(e).

A finding of fraudulent intent is a finding of fact, which we will not disturb absent clear error.  See Max Sugarman Funeral Home, Inc. v. ADB Investors, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556605\"><a href=\"/opinion/556605/24-collier-bankrcas2d-1414-bankr-l-rep-p-73841-max-sugarman-funeral/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1248</span></a></span>, 1255 (1st Cir.1991).

Gen. Laws ch.  109A, &#167; 7.  It is the rare case in which a transferor admits that he intended to make an impermissible transfer.  Thus, courts often infer fraudulent intent by considering certain \"badges of fraud,\" the most common of which are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) actual or threatened litigation against the debtor;  (2) a purported transfer of all or substantially all of the debtor's property;  (3) insolvency or other unmanageable indebtedness on the part of the debtor;  (4) a special relationship between the debtor and the transferee;  and (5) retention by the debtor of the property involved in the putative transfer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Palmer v.

They occurred after a jury had rendered a $7.8 million verdict against Pittorino and while the claims against Amelia and Pittorino as trustees were still pending.  Thus, the trustees faced actual litigation in which their co-defendant had already been held liable.  Next, it is undisputed that Pittorino and Amelia transferred almost all of the trust property.  The conveyances therefore constituted a \"transfer of all or substantially all of [debtor Pigeon Hill Trust's] property.\"   Third, the transfers left Pigeon Hill Trust with little-to-no assets, yet potentially liable for the outstanding guaranty on the unpaid Pittorino loans.  This constitutes de facto \"insolvency or other unmanageable indebtedness.\"   Fourth, it is undisputed that there was a special relationship between the transferors and the transferees:  Pittorino is the controlling shareholder of Pitt, while Amelia and his wife are respectively the sole trustee and beneficiary of ALA.  For that same reason, the trustees retained control over the property involved in the putative transfer, thereby constituting a fifth badge of fraud.  The district court's finding of fraudulent intent is affirmed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Amelia assigns error to a jury instruction given at the conclusion of the trial on his mutual mistake defense.  That instruction related to one John Driscoll, whom Michael Oleksak, the loan officer for Vanguard, testified had been counsel to Vanguard and had drafted the guaranty in question.  The court instructed the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>But also there's Mr. Driscoll.  If you believe the testimony, Mr. Driscoll was also an agent of the bank.  Mr. Driscoll was the lawyer on behalf of the bank.  Were the papers, if you believe the testimony about the drafting of the papers, were these papers drafted the way the bank wanted them drafted?   Or, has Mr. Amelia proved that in fact there was a mistake on the part of the bank and that mistake was mutual, was the same as the mistake Mr. Amelia made when he signed the papers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing DeVaux v.

[when] the jury and not the judge is to decide such a matter.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither of these arguments were preserved for appeal because Amelia did not properly note his objection in the court below.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51 states, in relevant part, that \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict.\"   Although counsel for Amelia argued during the charge conference that there was no evidence that attorney Driscoll was an agent for the bank--an argument different from the two arguably being made on appeal--this objection was insufficient to preserve the issue because counsel failed to renew the objection after the district court delivered the jury charge.  \"[I]t is an ironclad rule in this circuit that failure to renew objections after the charge constitutes waiver of any claim of error.\"  Wilson v.

Amelia's briefs on appeal do not set forth any facts that support the estoppel defense.  Any other theory is insufficiently developed and therefore waived.  See King, 116 F.3d at 970</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In his reply brief, Amelia states, without citation to the record, that he \"made an offer of proof to the [t]rial [c]ourt that confirming correspondence would be produced contemporaneous to the FDIC's actual issuance of an executed [m]ortgage [d]ischarge.\"   Appellant's Reply Br. at 21.  This statement is inaccurate and misleading.  During the conference, Amelia's counsel did make the following cryptic remarks:  \"The FDIC then issued a decision that they investigated the unlimited guaranty [the guaranty at issue here], determined it to be of no legal effect and that therefore your discharge shall be coming.\"   In response to this proffer, the court immediately asked whether there was any documentary evidence rescinding Pigeon Hill Trusts' obligations on the guaranty.  Counsel responded only that there existed an internal memorandum and an affidavit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In his brief, Amelia contends that the UFTA applies to this action because \"the record includes transfers in November and December 1996 and February, March and May 1997.\"   Appellant's Br. at 22.  As if to support this contention, eleven pages of the brief are devoted to describing a series of transactions that occurred after the May 10, 1996 conveyances.  This description appears in a section entitled \"Statement of Real Estate Transfers Relevant to the Parties of the Case.\"  Amelia's counsel, however, admitted during oral argument that these conveyances are irrelevant to the instant action</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The other arguments made by Amelia regarding the court's application of the UFCA are hopelessly confused.  Initially, Amelia contends that the district court misapplied the UFCA by failing to find either actual or constructive fraud.  See Appellant's Br. at 25 (\"The judge in this case did not find that Mr. Amelia committed actual fraud or constructive fraud.\").  Later in the same brief, however, Amelia seems to admit that the district court found both actual and constructive fraud since he challenges these findings as erroneous.  See Appellant's Br. at 26-37.  Because we find that the district court correctly found actual fraud, and because a conveyance may be set aside under a finding of either actual or constructive fraud, we affirm without addressing Amelia's claims that the district court's finding of constructive fraud is erroneous</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The issue before the court in DeVaux was whether a secretary of a law firm had actual or implied authority to establish an attorney-client relationship on behalf of the law firm.
