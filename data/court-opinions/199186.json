Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\n               Stahl and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Peter Marsh on brief for appellant.\n     Paul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney and David        L.\nBroderick, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                      December 11, 2000\n\f           Per Curiam. After securing a remand under sentence\n\nfour of 42 U.S.C. § 405(g), claimant Wilma Brunel filed an\n\napplication for attorneys fees and costs under the Equal\n\nAccess to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A).\n\nBecause the district court judge who ordered the remand had\n\npassed away by the time claimant's EAJA application became\n\nripe for adjudication, the application was assigned to a new\n\njudge, who denied it.        Claimant appeals this ruling.\n\n           We   review     the    denial      of     the    claimant's   EAJA\n\napplication only for an abuse of discretion, although pure\n\nquestions of law are reviewed de novo, and findings of fact\n\nare reviewed for clear error.             See Pierce v. Underwood, 487\n\nU.S. 552, 557-63 (1988); Paris v. H.U.D., 988 F.2d 236, 238\n\n(1st Cir. 1993); De Allende v. Baker, 891 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).   Although    we    deem     it    a   very    close    question,   we\n\nconclude   that    the    district       court     abused    its   discretion\n\nbecause,   on     this    record,    the      Commissioner's        exclusive\n\nreliance on the Grid and subsequent defense of that reliance\n\nwere not substantially justified.                Accordingly, we reverse\n\nand remand for the calculation of an appropriate award of\n\nattorney's fees, for the following reasons.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f             An abuse of discretion occurs when, \"a material\n\n factor deserving significant weight was ignored, an improper\n\n factor    was    relied   upon,   or   all   proper   and   no   improper\n\n factors were assessed, but the district court made a serious\n\n mistake in weighing them.         See Casa Maria Hogar Geriatrico,\n\n Inc. v. Rivera-Santis, 38 F.2d 615, 618 (1st Cir. 1994).                 It\n\n is true that the RFC assessment upon which the ALJ relied\n\n indicated that claimant could sit for two hours continuously\n\n and for a total of six hours per day.                 This alone might\n\n suggest    that    claimant   could    perform   the    full     range   of\n\n sedentary work, thereby obviating any need for vocational\n\n evidence.       But the district court overlooked the fact that\n\n the bottom half of the very same assessment indicated that\n\n claimant needs to take 15-minute breaks to elevate her legs\n\n from 4-5 times on a good day to 8 or more times on a bad\n\n day.     This limitation implies that claimant is not capable\n\n of the full range of sedentary work, for a significant\n\n amount of her sitting time must be spent with her legs\n\n elevated.1      The ALJ's failure to explain why he discredited\n\n this evidence was a serious error.\n\n\n\n\n    1By \"significant\" we mean more than can be accommodated by\nthe three morning, lunch, and afternoon work breaks identified\nin SSR 96-9p.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            Abundant case law, including two district court\n\ncases within this circuit, advises ALJs to take vocational\n\nevidence when faced with claimants with unusual needs to\n\nalternate sitting and standing.          See, e.g. Peterson v.\n\nChater, 96 F.3d 1015, 1016 (7th Cir. 1996); Jesurum            v.\n\nSecretary D.H.H.S., 48 F.3d 114, 119-20 (3d Cir. 1995);\n\nScott v. Shalala, 30 F.3d 33, 34-35 (5th Cir. 1994); Ragland\n\nv. Shalala, 992 F.2d 1056, 1059 n. 45 (10th Cir. 1993);\n\nGallant v. Heckler, 753 F.2d 1450, 1457 (9th Cir. 1984);\n\nWages v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 755 F.2d\n\n495, 498-99 (6th Cir. 1985); Lawler v. Heckler, 761 F.2d 195,\n\n197-98 (5th Cir. 1985); Gibson v. Heckler, 762 F.2d 1516,\n\n1521 (11th Cir. 1985); Adie v. Commissioner, 941 F. Supp.\n\n261, 270 n. 9 (D.N.H. 1996);          Curtis v. Shalala, 808 F.\n\nSupp. 917 (D.N.H. 1992).     Cf. Nguyen v. Chater, 172 F.3d 31,\n\n36 (1st Cir. 1999)(cautioning that an inability to remain\n\nseated   may   erode   the   sedentary   base).   In   light   of\n\nsignificant amount of countervailing authority, if the ALJ\n\ndeemed claimant's case one that justified swimming against\n\nthis tide, he should have made his reasons for doing so\n\nexplicit.\n\n            The ALJ's error was particularly egregious because\n\nhe cited the claimant's treating doctor's RFC evaluation in\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fsupport of his own RFC findings, while ignoring, without any\n\nexplanation, that part of the doctor's evaluation which\n\nindicated that claimant's capacity for sedentary work was\n\nsignificantly compromised.        The ALJ thus plainly violated\n\nthe Commissioner's own regulations and rulings.               See 20\n\nC.F.R. §404.1527(d)(\"We will always give good reason in our\n\nnotice of determination or decision for the weight we give\n\nyour treating source's opinion); SSR 96-2p (\"the notice of\n\ndetermination or decision must contain specific reasons for\n\nthe weight given to the treating source's medical opinion,\n\nsupported by the evidence in the case record, and must be\n\nsufficiently specific      to make clear to any subsequent\n\nreviewers the weight the adjudicator gave to the treating\n\nsource's medical opinion and the reasons for that weight.\").\n\nWe cannot deem such disregard for the Commissioner's own\n\nguidelines substantially justified.          See, e.g., Sampson v.\n\nChater, 103 F.3d 918, 922 (9th Cir. 1996)(suggesting that it\n\nis an abuse of discretion to find an agency's position\n\nsubstantially justified when the agency violates its own\n\nregulations); Flores v. Shalala 49 F.3d 562, 570-71 (9th Cir.\n\n1995)(holding   ALJ's   failure    to   consider   a   VE's   report\n\nregarding a claimant's mathematical abilities without any\n\nexplanation   unreasonable   enough     to   justify   an   award   of\n\n\n                              -5-\n\fattorneys' fees); Cornella v. Schweiker, 728 F.2d                         978, 985\n\n(8th Cir. 1984)(\"It was not reasonable for the Secretary to\n\nignore her own regulations.\").\n\n            We    further      note    that    the     ALJ's       decision      was\n\nambiguous on its face.          It was not clear whether his finding\n\nthat the claimant \"should be able to alternate sitting and\n\nstanding within these time frames as necessary\" meant that\n\nclaimant should be able to alternate positions within the\n\ntwo hours of sitting that the ALJ found her capable of, or\n\nonly after she had sat for two hours.                The ambiguity becomes\n\neven more apparent when one reads the RFC assessment of Dr.\n\nNess that the ALJ cited.          The ALJ issued his decision on the\n\nheels of SSR 96-2p (requiring ALJs to specify reasons for\n\nthe weight they accord treating physicians' opinions) and\n\nSSR 96-9p (directing ALJs to specify the frequency of a\n\nclaimant's       need   to   alternate       sitting    and    standing         with\n\nrespect to the three morning, lunch, and afternoon breaks\n\ngenerally permitted by sedentary work).                 Yet the ALJ did not\n\ncite either ruling, although they both took effect on the\n\nday   of   claimant's        administrative      hearing.           The   Appeals\n\nCouncil was plainly in a position to require the ALJ to\n\nclarify    his    decision.        Its    failure      to     do    so    was   not\n\nsubstantially justified.              See Peterson v. Chater, 96 F.3d\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fF.3d at 1016 (criticizing Appeals Council for failing to\n\nspot conflict between findings that claimant was incapable\n\nof prolonged sitting and standing and finding that claimant\n\nhad RFC for sedentary work); Cummings v. Sullivan, 950 F.2d\n\n492, 497 (7th Cir. 1991)(Appeals Council's decision is part\n\nof agency's prelitigation conduct that must be examined in\n\ndetermining     whether     the    Commissioner's      position        is\n\nsubstantially justified).\n\n           In view of the foregoing, we          reverse the order\n\ndenying    claimant's    EAJA   application    and   remand    for    the\n\ndistrict    court   to    calculate     an   appropriate      award    of\n\nattorney's fees.    The district court should consider whether\n\nthe time claimant's counsel spent litigating the issue of\n\nwhether    claimant's     environmental      sensitivities      further\n\neroded her capacity for sedentary work should be excluded\n\nfrom the fee award.      See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424,\n\n435-436 (1983).\n\n           So ordered.     See Local Rule 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

See 20\n\nC.F.R. §404.1527(d)(\"We will always give good reason in our\n\nnotice of determination or decision for the weight we give\n\nyour treating source's opinion); SSR 96-2p (\"the notice of\n\ndetermination or decision must contain specific reasons for\n\nthe weight given to the treating source's medical opinion,\n\nsupported by the evidence in the case record, and must be\n\nsufficiently specific      to make clear to any subsequent\n\nreviewers the weight the adjudicator gave to the treating\n\nsource's medical opinion and the reasons for that weight.\").\n\nWe cannot deem such disregard for the Commissioner's own\n\nguidelines substantially justified.

It was not clear whether his finding\n\nthat the claimant \"should be able to alternate sitting and\n\nstanding within these time frames as necessary\" meant that\n\nclaimant should be able to alternate positions within the\n\ntwo hours of sitting that the ALJ found her capable of, or\n\nonly after she had sat for two hours.                The ambiguity becomes\n\neven more apparent when one reads the RFC assessment of Dr.\n\nNess that the ALJ cited.          The ALJ issued his decision on the\n\nheels of SSR 96-2p (requiring ALJs to specify reasons for\n\nthe weight they accord treating physicians' opinions) and\n\nSSR 96-9p (directing ALJs to specify the frequency of a\n\nclaimant's       need   to   alternate       sitting    and    standing         with\n\nrespect to the three morning, lunch, and afternoon breaks\n\ngenerally permitted by sedentary work).                 Yet the ALJ did not\n\ncite either ruling, although they both took effect on the\n\nday   of   claimant's        administrative      hearing.           The   Appeals\n\nCouncil was plainly in a position to require the ALJ to\n\nclarify    his    decision.        Its    failure      to     do    so    was   not\n\nsubstantially justified.              See Peterson v.
