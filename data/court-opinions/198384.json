Six plaintiffs, purchasers of\r\ncommon stock of Individual, Inc. (\"Individual\" or \"the Company\"),\r\nbrought suit under sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933\r\n(the \"1933 Act\") against Individual, its board members, and the\r\nunderwriters who participated in Individual's March 1996 initial\r\npublic offering (\"IPO\").  Plaintiffs claim that defendants made\r\nmaterially false and misleading statements and omitted material\r\nfacts in connection with the registration statement and prospectus\r\nfor the IPO.  The focus of plaintiffs' claim is that defendants\r\nimproperly failed to disclose that, at the time the IPO became\r\neffective, a conflict existed between Yosi Amram (\"Amram\") -- the\r\ndirector, founder, chief executive officer and president of\r\nIndividual -- and a majority of the board of directors about the\r\nstrategic direction the company should take.  The complaint alleges\r\nthat, as a result of this conflict, Amram left Individual, causing\r\nthe price of the Company's stock to fall sharply.  It is claimed\r\nthat failure to disclose this conflict in the registration\r\nstatement and prospectus is an omission of a material fact which\r\nrenders defendants liable for the damages allegedly suffered.\r\nOn April 15, 1997, defendants moved to dismiss\r\nplaintiffs' claims for failure to state a claim.  In a Memorandum\r\nand Order dated May 27, 1998, the district court granted\r\ndefendants' motions in their entirety.  This appeal followed.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\n1.  Individual's Business\r\nIndividual is in the business of providing electronic\r\ncustomized information services.  The Company searches tens of\r\nthousands of news sources each day and delivers to its customers\r\npersonalized packages of news stories by facsimile, e-mail, the\r\nInternet, and other network systems.  Individual serves enterprises\r\nas well as individual users.  The Company is supported primarily by\r\nrevenue from subscriptions paid by its users.  Amram founded\r\nIndividual in 1989 and was largely responsible for its rapid growth\r\nfrom a start-up to a public company.  Until August 1996, Amram\r\nserved as a director, president and CEO of Individual.\r\n2.  The Registration Statement and Prospectus\r\nOn January 31, 1996, Individual publicly announced that\r\nit had filed a registration statement with the Securities and\r\nExchange Commission (\"SEC\") for an initial public offering of 2.5\r\nmillion shares of common stock.  The SEC declared the registration\r\nstatement effective on March 15, 1996 and 2.5 million shares were\r\noffered to the public at a price of $14 per share.\r\nPlaintiffs allege that at the time the registration\r\nstatement became effective\r\nthere was a substantial disagreement between\r\nAmram . . . and a majority of the Board\r\nmembers . . . as to the strategic direction of\r\nthe Company.  Amram believed that the Company\r\nshould grow and expand through rapid, often\r\ncostly, acquisitions of new businesses.  The\r\nmajority of the Board, however, believed that\r\nIndividual should grow through building its\r\ncore business through, among other things, the\r\ngrowth of its subscriber base, the expansion\r\nof its information base and providers, and\r\nenhancement of its knowledge processing\r\nsystems.  Prior to the Offering, a majority of\r\nthe Board was greatly concerned about, and\r\nfirmly opposed to, Amram's growth through\r\nacquisition strategy.\r\n\nThe prospectus did not disclose the existence of any disagreement\r\nbetween Amram and the majority of the Board.  Instead, the\r\nprospectus stated that the Company's future objective was \"to build\r\nthe industry's leading 'open information exchange' . . . . [by]\r\nenhanc[ing] its knowledge processing systems and expand[ing] its\r\nbase of participants.\"  The description in the prospectus thus\r\nmirrors the complaint's description of the majority of the Board's\r\nstrategy: growth through development of Individual's existing core\r\nbusiness.\r\n3.  Post-Public Offering Developments\r\nThe price of Individual's stock rose rapidly in the\r\nperiod after the IPO due to the Company's announcements of new\r\nstrategic alliances with Microsoft and Toshiba.  In addition, on\r\nApril 23, 1996, Individual announced its first quarter results, as\r\nwell as a 233% increase in its number of users.  In the aftermath\r\nof these announcements, Individual's stock price rose from $16 to\r\n$20 per share in just three days -- a total increase of over\r\ntwenty-two percent.\r\n4.  Amram's Departure\r\nOn July 24, 1996, Individual announced that Amram was\r\ntaking an \"indefinite leave of absence\" from the Company due to a\r\ndisagreement with the Board over \"the pace of acquisitions.\" \r\nRobert Lentz, Individual's CFO, explained that Amram wanted the\r\nCompany to move faster in making acquisitions and investments as\r\nthe Internet's popularity exploded.  Immediately after the\r\nannouncement of Amram's leave, the price of Individual stock fell\r\n37% from the previous day's close of $9.50 per share to $6 per\r\nshare.\r\nA July 25, 1996 Bloomberg News report confirmed that\r\nAmram's departure was due to the fact that Amram wanted to augment\r\nthe speed and breadth of Individual's acquisitions and investments,\r\nwhile the majority of the Board strongly opposed such a strategy. \r\nOn July 30, 1996, then-acting chairman of Individual, William A.\r\nDeveraux, also attributed Amram's departure to his frustration with\r\nthe Board's position that it was inappropriate to pursue venture\r\ncapital activities using Individual's funds and resources. \r\nDevereaux reiterated that the Board's plan, as described in the\r\nprospectus, was to pursue strategically moderate deals, which could\r\neasily be integrated into the Company's core business.\r\nOn August 7, 1996, Amram issued a public statement that\r\nhe would resign as CEO in protest over the Board's actions during\r\nthe prior two weeks.  According to the complaint, those actions\r\nincluded his dismissal without notice after he informed other\r\ndirectors of his plan to establish another company, \"Free Spirit\r\nHoldings,\" to invest in the entertainment, media and health care\r\nindustries.  Amram planned to contribute 100,000 shares of\r\nIndividual stock to Free Spirit Holdings and wanted the Company to\r\ncontribute another 100,000 shares.  The Board rejected this\r\nproposal.  At the end of the day, the Board announced that it had\r\nterminated the employment of Amram, although he still remained a\r\nmember of the Board.\r\nThe next day, on August 8, Amram announced that he had\r\nquit his position with the Company but that he would fight to\r\nregain leadership.  On August 9, Richard Vancil, Individual's vice\r\npresident of marketing, explained Amram's departure: \"There was a \r\ndivergence of strategy.  Yosi wanted rapid and multiple\r\nacquisitions and the board was focusing on growing the core\r\nbusiness.\"  Vancil further stated that \"Amram's strategy was more\r\nin line with a venture capital strategy.\"\r\n5.  Proceedings Below\r\nIn the proceedings below, plaintiffs claimed that\r\ndefendants' failure to disclose the conflict between Amram and the\r\nmajority of the Board at the time the IPO became effective violated\r\nsections 11 and 15 of the 1933 Act.  After concluding that the\r\ncomplaint adequately alleged that such a conflict in fact existed\r\nat the time of the IPO, the district judge found that: (1) the\r\nalleged omission was material; and (2) although material, there was\r\nno duty to disclose.\r\nOn appeal, plaintiffs challenge the district judge's\r\nconclusion that, as a matter of law, defendants were under no duty\r\nto disclose the material fact of the Board-level dispute. \r\nDefendants challenge the district judge's threshold determination\r\nthat the allegations in the complaint \"barely -- but sufficiently\"\r\nsupport an inference that the Board-level conflict existed as of\r\nMarch 15, 1996 -- an essential element of plaintiffs' claim. \r\nDefendants also contest the district judge's determination of\r\nmateriality, claiming that, even if the alleged conflict existed as\r\nof March 15, 1996, its omission was immaterial as a matter of law.\r\nII.  DISCUSSION\r\n1.  Standard of Review\r\nWe review the dismissal of plaintiffs' amended\r\nconsolidated complaint de novo.  See Suna v. Bailey Corp., 107 F.3d\r\n64, 68 (1st Cir. 1997).  We accept as true all well-pleaded\r\nallegations and give plaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable\r\ninferences.  See Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., 93 F.3d 987, 991 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  Dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is only\r\nappropriate if the complaint, so viewed, presents no set of facts\r\njustifying recovery.  See Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College,\r\n889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\nSection 11 imposes liability on signers of a registration\r\nstatement and on underwriters, among others, if the registration\r\nstatement, at the time it became effective, \"contained an untrue\r\nstatement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact\r\nrequired to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements\r\ntherein not misleading.\"  15 U.S.C.  77k(a).  Thus, to avoid\r\ndismissal of their  11 claim, plaintiffs must successfully allege:\r\n(1) that Individual's prospectus contained an omission; (2) that\r\nthe omission was material; (3) that defendants were under a duty to\r\ndisclose the omitted information; and (4) that such omitted\r\ninformation existed at the time the prospectus became effective. \r\nSee id.\r\n2.  Standing\r\nWe first address the threshold issue of standing. \r\nDefendants contend that plaintiffs lack standing to assert their\r\n11 claim.  Specifically, defendants argue that  11 relief is\r\nonly available to those individuals who purchase their shares\r\ndirectly through the IPO subject to the registration statement at\r\nissue.  According to the complaint, three of the six plaintiffs\r\ndid in fact purchase their shares directly through Individual's\r\nMarch 15, 1996 IPO.  Thus, even accepting defendants' argument,\r\nthese three plaintiffs would have standing to assert a  11 claim. \r\nIn any event, because we are affirming the district court's\r\ndismissal of the plaintiffs'  11 claims on other grounds, we need\r\nnot resolve the standing issue.\r\n3.  The Existence of a Board-level Conflict as of\r\n    March 15, 1996\r\n\n    We next address defendants' claim that the complaint does\r\nnot adequately allege an essential element of plaintiffs' claim. \r\nSpecifically, defendants argue that the uncontested fact that a\r\nBoard-level dispute about the strategic direction of the Company\r\nexisted in July 1996 is not enough to support the inference that\r\nthe conflict existed on March 15, 1996, the date the prospectus\r\nbecame effective.\r\nAs discussed above, in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6)\r\nmotion, the demands on the pleader are minimal.  \"Nevertheless,\r\nminimal requirements are not tantamount to nonexistent\r\nrequirements.\"  Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 514 (1st\r\nCir. 1988).  To survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must set\r\nforth \"factual allegations, either direct or inferential,\r\nrespecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery\r\nunder some actionable legal theory.\"  Id. at 515.  This court has\r\npreviously plotted the dividing line between adequate \"facts\" and\r\ninadequate \"conclusions\": \"it is only when . . . conclusions are\r\nlogically compelled, or at least supported, by the stated facts,\r\nthat is, when the suggested inference rises to what experience\r\nindicates is an acceptable level of probability, that 'conclusions'\r\nbecome 'facts' for pleading purposes.\"  Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d\r\nat 16.  We thus examine plaintiffs' factual allegations to see if\r\nthey support the conclusions pled.\r\nPlaintiffs allege that the July 24, 1996 announcement of\r\nAmram's decision to take a leave of absence -- just four and one-\r\nhalf months after the IPO -- supports the \"conclusion\" that a\r\nBoard-level conflict existed at the time of the IPO.  To further\r\nsupport this conclusion, plaintiffs point to news reports published\r\non July 25, 1996, and August 9, 1996, attributing Amram's departure\r\nto a \"divergence of strategy\" between Amram and the majority of the\r\nBoard.  The July 25 report further suggested that the conflict\r\nbetween Amram and the Board was not of recent origin: \"It's hard to\r\nmake headway in a battle if the Company's direction is still a\r\nmatter of debate.\"\r\nPlaintiffs' factual allegations clearly support the\r\ncontention that a conflict between Amram and the Board existed in\r\nJuly 1996.  The more difficult question is whether these\r\nallegations also support the inference that this conflict existed\r\nas early as March 15, 1996.\r\nIn Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., this court upheld the\r\ndismissal of a securities complaint on the ground that references\r\nin the minutes of a June 14 board meeting to delays in orders that\r\nthe company was receiving at that time did not support the\r\ninference that the Company knew about those delays at the time of\r\nits May 3 press release.  See 93 F.3d at 995.  The court emphasized\r\nthat the June 14 board meeting was held five weeks after the\r\ncompany issued its May 3 press release.  See id.  Defendants argue\r\nthat, in light of Gross, plaintiffs' allegations of a conflict four\r\nand one-half months after the IPO, cannot, as a matter of law,\r\nsupport the inference that the conflict existed at the time of the\r\nIPO.\r\nWe disagree.  We believe that the departure of the\r\npresident, CEO and founder of the Company -- just four and one-half\r\nmonths after the IPO -- is fundamentally different from a delay in\r\ncustomer orders, the situation presented in Gross.  Our \"experience\r\nindicates,\" Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 16, that Board-level\r\nconflicts, like the one that existed in July 1996, \"do not arise or\r\ndisappear overnight.\"  Memorandum and Order at 21.  We agree with\r\nthe district court that plaintiffs' suggested inference rises to\r\n\"an acceptable level of probability.\"  Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d\r\nat 16.\r\nMoreover, although we recognize the strong public policy\r\nagainst allowing discovery in securities cases filed without a\r\nsubstantial factual basis, see Private Securities Litigation Reform\r\nAct of 1995, 15 U.S.C.  78u, we are also mindful of the procedural\r\nposture of this case: all discovery has been stayed pending\r\ndefendants' motion to dismiss.  \"[W]e cannot hold plaintiffs to a\r\nstandard that would effectively require them, pre-discovery, to\r\nplead evidence.\"  Digital, 82 F.3d at 1225.  We thus affirm the\r\ndistrict court's finding that plaintiffs' complaint adequately\r\nalleged the existence of a Board-level conflict as of March 15,\r\n1996, the date the IPO became effective.\r\n4.  Materiality of Omitted Fact\r\nWe next address defendants' challenge to the district\r\njudge's determination of materiality.  Defendants argue that, even\r\nif the conflict between Amram and the majority of the Board existed\r\nat the time of the IPO, Individual's omission of this conflict from\r\nthe prospectus was immaterial as a matter of law.\r\nThis court has delineated the boundaries of materiality\r\nin the securities law context:\r\nThe mere fact that an investor might find\r\ninformation interesting or desirable is not\r\nsufficient to satisfy the materiality\r\nrequirement.  Rather, information is\r\n\"material\" only if its  disclosure would alter\r\nthe \"total mix\" of facts available to the\r\ninvestor and \"if there is a substantial\r\nlikelihood that a reasonable shareholder would\r\nconsider it important\" to the investment\r\ndecision.\r\n\nMilton v. Van Dorn Co., 961 F.2d 965, 969 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting\r\nBasic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32 (1988)).  We agree\r\nwith the district court that it is substantially likely that\r\nreasonable investors would consider the existence of a Board-level\r\nconflict over the future direction of the Company important to\r\ntheir investment decision.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of our role\r\nin making determinations of materiality:\r\nAlthough materiality is a mixed question of\r\nlaw and fact which the trier of fact\r\nordinarily decides . . . if the alleged\r\nmisrepresentations or omissions are so\r\nobviously unimportant to an investor that\r\nreasonable minds cannot differ on the question\r\nof materiality [it is] appropriate for the\r\ndistrict court to rule that the allegations\r\nare inactionable as a matter of law.\r\n\nIn re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig., 7 F.3d 357, 369 n.13 (3d\r\nCir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  We\r\ncannot characterize the conflict between Amram and the Board as\r\n\"obviously unimportant\" to a reasonable investor.\r\n5.  Duty to Disclose\r\nGiven our determination that the omission of the alleged\r\nBoard-level conflict was material, the question remains whether\r\ndefendants had a duty to disclose this \"material fact\" in the\r\nCompany's registration statement.\r\nIn Digital, this court reiterated the well-settled\r\nproposition that \"the mere possession of material nonpublic\r\ninformation does not create a duty to disclose it.\"  Digital, 82\r\nF.3d at 1202.  Although in the context of a public offering there\r\nis a strong affirmative duty of disclosure, it is clear that an\r\nissuer of securities owes no absolute duty to disclose all material\r\ninformation.  See id.  The issue, rather, is whether the securities\r\nlaw imposes on defendants a \"specific obligation\" to disclose\r\ninformation of the type that plaintiffs claim was omitted.  Id. at\r\n1202.  We thus look to the explicit language of section 11 to\r\ndetermine whether it imposes on defendants a \"specific obligation\"\r\nto disclose the Board-level conflict that allegedly existed on\r\nMarch 15, 1996.\r\nThe Digital court set out the circumstances in which\r\nsection 11 imposes a duty of disclosure:\r\nSection 11 by its terms provides for the\r\nimposition of liability if a registration\r\nstatement, as of its effective date: (1)\r\n\"contained an untrue statement of material\r\nfact\"; (2) \"omitted to state a material fact\r\nrequired to be stated therein\"; or (3) omitted\r\nto state material fact \"necessary to make the\r\nstatements therein not misleading.\"\r\n\nDigital, 82 F.3d at 1204 (quoting 15 U.S.C.  77k(a)).  Plaintiffs\r\nbase their claim of nondisclosure on the second and third prongs of\r\nthe statute.  Specifically, plaintiffs claim that: (1) the\r\nexistence of the Board-level conflict was a material fact required\r\nto be stated therein; and (2) disclosure of the Board-level\r\nconflict was necessary to make other statements in the registration\r\nstatement not misleading.\r\nPlaintiffs base their first argument on Regulation S-K,\r\nItem 101(a), which identifies some of the information \"required to\r\nbe stated\" in registration statements.  See 17 C.F.R.  229.101(a). \r\nItem 101(a) requires an issuer, in the context of an IPO, to\r\n\"[d]escribe the general development of the business of the\r\nregistrant.\"  17 C.F.R.  229.101(a).  Plaintiffs argue that Item\r\n101(a) by its terms \"required\" the disclosure of the alleged Board-\r\nlevel dispute as to the development of Individual's business. \r\nPlaintiffs raise this argument for the first time in a footnote of\r\ntheir appellate brief.  By failing to raise the applicability of\r\nItem 101(a) in the district court, plaintiffs have waived this\r\nargument.  \"Our law is clear that a party ordinarily may not raise\r\non appeal issues that were not seasonably advanced (and, hence,\r\npreserved) below.\"  See Daigle v. Maine Medical Center, Inc., 14\r\nF.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).  We thus turn to plaintiffs' second\r\nargument.\r\nThis argument is to the effect that defendants had a\r\n\"specific obligation\" to disclose the Board-level conflict because\r\nits omission rendered affirmative statements in the registration\r\nstatement misleading.  In making this argument, plaintiffs point to\r\ntwo sections of the registration statement: (1) the \"business\r\nmodel\" section, and (2) the \"use of proceeds\" section.\r\nThe \"business model\" section of the prospectus states\r\nthat the Company's objective is:\r\nto build the industry's leading 'open\r\ninformation exchange' linking a growing base\r\nof knowledge workers to relevant information\r\nproviders and advertisers.  The Company\r\nbelieves that the value of this exchange will\r\nincrease as the Company enhances its knowledge\r\nprocessing systems and expands its base of\r\nparticipants.  An expanding set of information\r\nproviders will make the services more\r\ncompelling for knowledge workers.  A larger\r\nuser base will generate additional readership\r\nand revenues for information providers. \r\nIncreased participation of advertisers, who\r\nbenefit from a larger user base and a growing\r\nnumber of information topics, will help to\r\nreduce subscription costs, leading to further\r\nexpansion of the Company's user base.\r\n\n                         . . .\r\n\nThe Company believes the mutually reinforcing\r\ndynamics of its business model are key to\r\nsustaining its growth and meeting its\r\nstrategic objectives.\r\n\nPlaintiffs argue that this statement is materially misleading\r\nbecause it fails to disclose that, at the time the statement was\r\nmade, Individual's \"business model\" was the subject of profound\r\ndisagreement between Amram and the majority of the Board.  Indeed,\r\naccording to the complaint, Amram's growth through acquisition\r\nstrategy was directly contrary to the Company's stated \"business\r\nmodel\" of growing the Company by developing its existing core\r\nbusiness.  Even accepting these allegations as true -- as we must\r\non a motion to dismiss -- we conclude that the omission of the\r\nconflict between Amram and the Board does not render the \"business\r\nmodel\" section of the prospectus misleading.\r\nIn short, the \"business model\" section of the prospectus,\r\ntaken as a whole, is true.  According to plaintiffs' complaint, the\r\nmajority of the Board was committed to growing the Company by\r\nbuilding on its existing core business.  Disclosure of the\r\nbusiness strategy supported by a majority of the directors did not\r\nobligate defendants also to disclose information about the extent\r\nto which each individual Board member supported that model.  Cf.Backman v. Polaroid, 910 F.2d 10, 16 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[E]ven a\r\nvoluntary disclosure of information that a reasonable investor\r\nwould consider material must be 'complete and accurate.'  This,\r\nhowever, does not mean that by revealing one fact about a product,\r\none must reveal all others that, too, would be interesting, market-\r\nwise.\").  More specifically, disclosure of the business strategy\r\nsupported by the majority of the Board did not obligate defendants\r\nalso to disclose the fact that Amram -- a distinct minority of a\r\nmulti-member Board -- opposed that strategy.  Cf. id.\r\nThe \"use of proceeds\" section of Individual's prospectus\r\nstates that a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO will be used\r\nfor \"general corporate purposes,\" as well as \"the acquisition of\r\nbusinesses, services and technologies that are complementary to\r\nthose of the Company.\"  Plaintiffs argue that this statement is\r\nmisleading because it fails to disclose that, at the time the\r\nstatement was made, Amram and the Board could not agree on what\r\nacquisitions were \"complementary to those of the Company\" nor on\r\nthe pace at which such acquisitions should be made.  We conclude\r\nthat the omission of Amram's conflict with the majority of the\r\nBoard did not render the \"use of proceeds\" section misleading. \r\nLike the \"business model\" section, the \"use of proceeds\" section of\r\nthe prospectus is complete and accurate on its face.  \r\nFirst, disclosure of the majority of the Board's\r\nintention to use the IPO proceeds for complementary acquisitions\r\ndid not obligate defendants also to disclose Amram's different\r\nviews concerning the types of acquisitions Individual should\r\npursue.  Cf. Backman, 910 F.2d at 16.  Second, the Company's\r\nadherence to the purpose stated in the \"use of proceeds\" section\r\nrendered that section accurate.  Indeed, the complaint alleges that\r\nAmram resigned due to the Board's summary rejection of his proposal\r\nthat the Company contribute 100,000 shares of Individual stock to\r\nFree Spirits Holdings, a non-complementary business combination\r\nthat Amram planned to establish.\r\nIn sum, both the \"business model\" section and the \"use of\r\nproceeds\" section were complete and accurate.  Because the omission\r\nof the Board-level conflict did not render either section\r\nmisleading, we agree with the district court that  11 did not\r\nimpose on defendants a duty of disclosure.\r\n6.  Section 15\r\nSection 15 of the 1933 Act establishes joint and several\r\nliability for \"controlling persons\"--that is, those who exercise\r\ncontrol over primary violators of  11.  15 U.S.C.  770.  A\r\nnecessary element of a  15 claim is a primary violation of  11. \r\nSee, e.g., SEC v. First Jersey Securities, Inc., 101 F.3d 1450,\r\n1472 (2d Cir. 1996).  Because plaintiffs have failed to state a\r\nclaim for such a primary violation, they have also failed to state\r\na claim under  15.  See Berliner v. Lotus Dev. Corp., 783 F. Supp.\r\n708, 712-13 (D. Mass. 1992).\r\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a\r\nclaim.\r\n",

Six plaintiffs, purchasers of\r\ncommon stock of Individual, Inc. (\"Individual\" or \"the Company\"),\r\nbrought suit under sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933\r\n(the \"1933 Act\") against Individual, its board members, and the\r\nunderwriters who participated in Individual's March 1996 initial\r\npublic offering (\"IPO\").  Plaintiffs claim that defendants made\r\nmaterially false and misleading statements and omitted material\r\nfacts in connection with the registration statement and prospectus\r\nfor the IPO.  The focus of plaintiffs' claim is that defendants\r\nimproperly failed to disclose that, at the time the IPO became\r\neffective, a conflict existed between Yosi Amram (\"Amram\") -- the\r\ndirector, founder, chief executive officer and president of\r\nIndividual -- and a majority of the board of directors about the\r\nstrategic direction the company should take.  The complaint alleges\r\nthat, as a result of this conflict, Amram left Individual, causing\r\nthe price of the Company's stock to fall sharply.  It is claimed\r\nthat failure to disclose this conflict in the registration\r\nstatement and prospectus is an omission of a material fact which\r\nrenders defendants liable for the damages allegedly suffered.\r\nOn April 15, 1997, defendants moved to dismiss\r\nplaintiffs' claims for failure to state a claim.  In a Memorandum\r\nand Order dated May 27, 1998, the district court granted\r\ndefendants' motions in their entirety.  This appeal followed.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\n1.  Individual's Business\r\nIndividual is in the business of providing electronic\r\ncustomized information services.  The Company searches tens of\r\nthousands of news sources each day and delivers to its customers\r\npersonalized packages of news stories by facsimile, e-mail, the\r\nInternet, and other network systems.  Individual serves enterprises\r\nas well as individual users.  The Company is supported primarily by\r\nrevenue from subscriptions paid by its users.  Amram founded\r\nIndividual in 1989 and was largely responsible for its rapid growth\r\nfrom a start-up to a public company.  Until August 1996, Amram\r\nserved as a director, president and CEO of Individual.\r\n2.  The Registration Statement and Prospectus\r\nOn January 31, 1996, Individual publicly announced that\r\nit had filed a registration statement with the Securities and\r\nExchange Commission (\"SEC\") for an initial public offering of 2.5\r\nmillion shares of common stock.  The SEC declared the registration\r\nstatement effective on March 15, 1996 and 2.5 million shares were\r\noffered to the public at a price of $14 per share.\r\nPlaintiffs allege that at the time the registration\r\nstatement became effective\r\nthere was a substantial disagreement between\r\nAmram . . . and a majority of the Board\r\nmembers . . . as to the strategic direction of\r\nthe Company.  Amram believed that the Company\r\nshould grow and expand through rapid, often\r\ncostly, acquisitions of new businesses.  The\r\nmajority of the Board, however, believed that\r\nIndividual should grow through building its\r\ncore business through, among other things, the\r\ngrowth of its subscriber base, the expansion\r\nof its information base and providers, and\r\nenhancement of its knowledge processing\r\nsystems.  Prior to the Offering, a majority of\r\nthe Board was greatly concerned about, and\r\nfirmly opposed to, Amram's growth through\r\nacquisition strategy.\r\n\nThe prospectus did not disclose the existence of any disagreement\r\nbetween Amram and the majority of the Board.  Instead, the\r\nprospectus stated that the Company's future objective was \"to build\r\nthe industry's leading 'open information exchange' . . . . [by]\r\nenhanc[ing] its knowledge processing systems and expand[ing] its\r\nbase of participants.\"  The description in the prospectus thus\r\nmirrors the complaint's description of the majority of the Board's\r\nstrategy: growth through development of Individual's existing core\r\nbusiness.\r\n3.  Post-Public Offering Developments\r\nThe price of Individual's stock rose rapidly in the\r\nperiod after the IPO due to the Company's announcements of new\r\nstrategic alliances with Microsoft and Toshiba.  In addition, on\r\nApril 23, 1996, Individual announced its first quarter results, as\r\nwell as a 233% increase in its number of users.  In the aftermath\r\nof these announcements, Individual's stock price rose from $16 to\r\n$20 per share in just three days -- a total increase of over\r\ntwenty-two percent.\r\n4.  Amram's Departure\r\nOn July 24, 1996, Individual announced that Amram was\r\ntaking an \"indefinite leave of absence\" from the Company due to a\r\ndisagreement with the Board over \"the pace of acquisitions.\" \r\nRobert Lentz, Individual's CFO, explained that Amram wanted the\r\nCompany to move faster in making acquisitions and investments as\r\nthe Internet's popularity exploded.  Immediately after the\r\nannouncement of Amram's leave, the price of Individual stock fell\r\n37% from the previous day's close of $9.50 per share to $6 per\r\nshare.\r\nA July 25, 1996 Bloomberg News report confirmed that\r\nAmram's departure was due to the fact that Amram wanted to augment\r\nthe speed and breadth of Individual's acquisitions and investments,\r\nwhile the majority of the Board strongly opposed such a strategy. \r\nOn July 30, 1996, then-acting chairman of Individual, William A.\r\nDeveraux, also attributed Amram's departure to his frustration with\r\nthe Board's position that it was inappropriate to pursue venture\r\ncapital activities using Individual's funds and resources. \r\nDevereaux reiterated that the Board's plan, as described in the\r\nprospectus, was to pursue strategically moderate deals, which could\r\neasily be integrated into the Company's core business.\r\nOn August 7, 1996, Amram issued a public statement that\r\nhe would resign as CEO in protest over the Board's actions during\r\nthe prior two weeks.  According to the complaint, those actions\r\nincluded his dismissal without notice after he informed other\r\ndirectors of his plan to establish another company, \"Free Spirit\r\nHoldings,\" to invest in the entertainment, media and health care\r\nindustries.  Amram planned to contribute 100,000 shares of\r\nIndividual stock to Free Spirit Holdings and wanted the Company to\r\ncontribute another 100,000 shares.  The Board rejected this\r\nproposal.  At the end of the day, the Board announced that it had\r\nterminated the employment of Amram, although he still remained a\r\nmember of the Board.\r\nThe next day, on August 8, Amram announced that he had\r\nquit his position with the Company but that he would fight to\r\nregain leadership.  On August 9, Richard Vancil, Individual's vice\r\npresident of marketing, explained Amram's departure: \"There was a \r\ndivergence of strategy.  Yosi wanted rapid and multiple\r\nacquisitions and the board was focusing on growing the core\r\nbusiness.\"  Vancil further stated that \"Amram's strategy was more\r\nin line with a venture capital strategy.\"\r\n5.  Proceedings Below\r\nIn the proceedings below, plaintiffs claimed that\r\ndefendants' failure to disclose the conflict between Amram and the\r\nmajority of the Board at the time the IPO became effective violated\r\nsections 11 and 15 of the 1933 Act.  After concluding that the\r\ncomplaint adequately alleged that such a conflict in fact existed\r\nat the time of the IPO, the district judge found that: (1) the\r\nalleged omission was material; and (2) although material, there was\r\nno duty to disclose.\r\nOn appeal, plaintiffs challenge the district judge's\r\nconclusion that, as a matter of law, defendants were under no duty\r\nto disclose the material fact of the Board-level dispute. \r\nDefendants challenge the district judge's threshold determination\r\nthat the allegations in the complaint \"barely -- but sufficiently\"\r\nsupport an inference that the Board-level conflict existed as of\r\nMarch 15, 1996 -- an essential element of plaintiffs' claim. \r\nDefendants also contest the district judge's determination of\r\nmateriality, claiming that, even if the alleged conflict existed as\r\nof March 15, 1996, its omission was immaterial as a matter of law.\r\nII.  DISCUSSION\r\n1.  Standard of Review\r\nWe review the dismissal of plaintiffs' amended\r\nconsolidated complaint de novo.  See Suna v. Bailey Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197221\"><a href=\"/opinion/197221/suna-v-bailey/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68 (1st Cir. 1997).  We accept as true all well-pleaded\r\nallegations and give plaintiffs the benefit of all reasonable\r\ninferences.  See Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196921\"><a href=\"/opinion/196921/gross-v-summa-four-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991 (1st\r\nCir. 1996).  Dismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) is only\r\nappropriate if the complaint, so viewed, presents no set of facts\r\njustifying recovery.  See Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth College,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\nSection 11 imposes liability on signers of a registration\r\nstatement and on underwriters, among others, if the registration\r\nstatement, at the time it became effective, \"contained an untrue\r\nstatement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact\r\nrequired to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements\r\ntherein not misleading.\"  15 U.S.C.  77k(a).  Thus, to avoid\r\ndismissal of their  11 claim, plaintiffs must successfully allege:\r\n(1) that Individual's prospectus contained an omission; (2) that\r\nthe omission was material; (3) that defendants were under a duty to\r\ndisclose the omitted information; and (4) that such omitted\r\ninformation existed at the time the prospectus became effective. \r\nSee id.\r\n2.  Standing\r\nWe first address the threshold issue of standing. \r\nDefendants contend that plaintiffs lack standing to assert their\r\n11 claim.  Specifically, defendants argue that  11 relief is\r\nonly available to those individuals who purchase their shares\r\ndirectly through the IPO subject to the registration statement at\r\nissue.  According to the complaint, three of the six plaintiffs\r\ndid in fact purchase their shares directly through Individual's\r\nMarch 15, 1996 IPO.  Thus, even accepting defendants' argument,\r\nthese three plaintiffs would have standing to assert a  11 claim. \r\nIn any event, because we are affirming the district court's\r\ndismissal of the plaintiffs'  11 claims on other grounds, we need\r\nnot resolve the standing issue.\r\n3.  The Existence of a Board-level Conflict as of\r\n    March 15, 1996\r\n\n    We next address defendants' claim that the complaint does\r\nnot adequately allege an essential element of plaintiffs' claim. \r\nSpecifically, defendants argue that the uncontested fact that a\r\nBoard-level dispute about the strategic direction of the Company\r\nexisted in July 1996 is not enough to support the inference that\r\nthe conflict existed on March 15, 1996, the date the prospectus\r\nbecame effective.\r\nAs discussed above, in the context of a Rule 12(b)(6)\r\nmotion, the demands on the pleader are minimal.  \"Nevertheless,\r\nminimal requirements are not tantamount to nonexistent\r\nrequirements.\"  Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508719\"><a href=\"/opinion/508719/william-r-gooley-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 514 (1st\r\nCir. 1988).  To survive a motion to dismiss, plaintiffs must set\r\nforth \"factual allegations, either direct or inferential,\r\nrespecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery\r\nunder some actionable legal theory.\"  Id. at 515.  This court has\r\npreviously plotted the dividing line between adequate \"facts\" and\r\ninadequate \"conclusions\": \"it is only when . . . conclusions are\r\nlogically compelled, or at least supported, by the stated facts,\r\nthat is, when the suggested inference rises to what experience\r\nindicates is an acceptable level of probability, that 'conclusions'\r\nbecome 'facts' for pleading purposes.\"  Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d\r\nat 16.  We thus examine plaintiffs' factual allegations to see if\r\nthey support the conclusions pled.\r\nPlaintiffs allege that the July 24, 1996 announcement of\r\nAmram's decision to take a leave of absence -- just four and one-\r\nhalf months after the IPO -- supports the \"conclusion\" that a\r\nBoard-level conflict existed at the time of the IPO.  To further\r\nsupport this conclusion, plaintiffs point to news reports published\r\non July 25, 1996, and August 9, 1996, attributing Amram's departure\r\nto a \"divergence of strategy\" between Amram and the majority of the\r\nBoard.  The July 25 report further suggested that the conflict\r\nbetween Amram and the Board was not of recent origin: \"It's hard to\r\nmake headway in a battle if the Company's direction is still a\r\nmatter of debate.\"\r\nPlaintiffs' factual allegations clearly support the\r\ncontention that a conflict between Amram and the Board existed in\r\nJuly 1996.  The more difficult question is whether these\r\nallegations also support the inference that this conflict existed\r\nas early as March 15, 1996.\r\nIn Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., this court upheld the\r\ndismissal of a securities complaint on the ground that references\r\nin the minutes of a June 14 board meeting to delays in orders that\r\nthe company was receiving at that time did not support the\r\ninference that the Company knew about those delays at the time of\r\nits May 3 press release.  See 93 F.3d at 995.  The court emphasized\r\nthat the June 14 board meeting was held five weeks after the\r\ncompany issued its May 3 press release.  See id.  Defendants argue\r\nthat, in light of Gross, plaintiffs' allegations of a conflict four\r\nand one-half months after the IPO, cannot, as a matter of law,\r\nsupport the inference that the conflict existed at the time of the\r\nIPO.\r\nWe disagree.  We believe that the departure of the\r\npresident, CEO and founder of the Company -- just four and one-half\r\nmonths after the IPO -- is fundamentally different from a delay in\r\ncustomer orders, the situation presented in Gross.  Our \"experience\r\nindicates,\" Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 16, that Board-level\r\nconflicts, like the one that existed in July 1996, \"do not arise or\r\ndisappear overnight.\"  Memorandum and Order at 21.  We agree with\r\nthe district court that plaintiffs' suggested inference rises to\r\n\"an acceptable level of probability.\"  Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d\r\nat 16.\r\nMoreover, although we recognize the strong public policy\r\nagainst allowing discovery in securities cases filed without a\r\nsubstantial factual basis, see Private Securities Litigation Reform\r\nAct of 1995, 15 U.S.C.  78u, we are also mindful of the procedural\r\nposture of this case: all discovery has been stayed pending\r\ndefendants' motion to dismiss.  \"[W]e cannot hold plaintiffs to a\r\nstandard that would effectively require them, pre-discovery, to\r\nplead evidence.\"  Digital, 82 F.3d at 1225.  We thus affirm the\r\ndistrict court's finding that plaintiffs' complaint adequately\r\nalleged the existence of a Board-level conflict as of March 15,\r\n1996, the date the IPO became effective.\r\n4.  Materiality of Omitted Fact\r\nWe next address defendants' challenge to the district\r\njudge's determination of materiality.  Defendants argue that, even\r\nif the conflict between Amram and the majority of the Board existed\r\nat the time of the IPO, Individual's omission of this conflict from\r\nthe prospectus was immaterial as a matter of law.\r\nThis court has delineated the boundaries of materiality\r\nin the securities law context:\r\nThe mere fact that an investor might find\r\ninformation interesting or desirable is not\r\nsufficient to satisfy the materiality\r\nrequirement.  Rather, information is\r\n\"material\" only if its  disclosure would alter\r\nthe \"total mix\" of facts available to the\r\ninvestor and \"if there is a substantial\r\nlikelihood that a reasonable shareholder would\r\nconsider it important\" to the investment\r\ndecision.\r\n\nMilton v. Van Dorn Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581509\"><a href=\"/opinion/581509/fed-sec-l-rep-p-96601-james-w-milton-v-van-dorn-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 969 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting\r\nBasic, Inc. v. Levinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112022\"><a href=\"/opinion/112022/basic-inc-v-levinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231-32 (1988)).  We agree\r\nwith the district court that it is substantially likely that\r\nreasonable investors would consider the existence of a Board-level\r\nconflict over the future direction of the Company important to\r\ntheir investment decision.\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of our role\r\nin making determinations of materiality:\r\nAlthough materiality is a mixed question of\r\nlaw and fact which the trier of fact\r\nordinarily decides . . . if the alleged\r\nmisrepresentations or omissions are so\r\nobviously unimportant to an investor that\r\nreasonable minds cannot differ on the question\r\nof materiality [it is] appropriate for the\r\ndistrict court to rule that the allegations\r\nare inactionable as a matter of law.\r\n\nIn re Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"655303\"><a href=\"/opinion/655303/in-re-donald-j-trump-casino-securities-litigation-taj-mahal-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 369 n.13 (3d\r\nCir. 1993) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  We\r\ncannot characterize the conflict between Amram and the Board as\r\n\"obviously unimportant\" to a reasonable investor.\r\n5.  Duty to Disclose\r\nGiven our determination that the omission of the alleged\r\nBoard-level conflict was material, the question remains whether\r\ndefendants had a duty to disclose this \"material fact\" in the\r\nCompany's registration statement.\r\nIn Digital, this court reiterated the well-settled\r\nproposition that \"the mere possession of material nonpublic\r\ninformation does not create a duty to disclose it.\"  Digital, 82\r\nF.3d at 1202.  Although in the context of a public offering there\r\nis a strong affirmative duty of disclosure, it is clear that an\r\nissuer of securities owes no absolute duty to disclose all material\r\ninformation.  See id.  The issue, rather, is whether the securities\r\nlaw imposes on defendants a \"specific obligation\" to disclose\r\ninformation of the type that plaintiffs claim was omitted.  Id. at\r\n1202.  We thus look to the explicit language of section 11 to\r\ndetermine whether it imposes on defendants a \"specific obligation\"\r\nto disclose the Board-level conflict that allegedly existed on\r\nMarch 15, 1996.\r\nThe Digital court set out the circumstances in which\r\nsection 11 imposes a duty of disclosure:\r\nSection 11 by its terms provides for the\r\nimposition of liability if a registration\r\nstatement, as of its effective date: (1)\r\n\"contained an untrue statement of material\r\nfact\"; (2) \"omitted to state a material fact\r\nrequired to be stated therein\"; or (3) omitted\r\nto state material fact \"necessary to make the\r\nstatements therein not misleading.\"\r\n\nDigital, 82 F.3d at 1204 (quoting 15 U.S.C.  77k(a)).  Plaintiffs\r\nbase their claim of nondisclosure on the second and third prongs of\r\nthe statute.  Specifically, plaintiffs claim that: (1) the\r\nexistence of the Board-level conflict was a material fact required\r\nto be stated therein; and (2) disclosure of the Board-level\r\nconflict was necessary to make other statements in the registration\r\nstatement not misleading.\r\nPlaintiffs base their first argument on Regulation S-K,\r\nItem 101(a), which identifies some of the information \"required to\r\nbe stated\" in registration statements.  See 17 C.F.R.  229.101(a). \r\nItem 101(a) requires an issuer, in the context of an IPO, to\r\n\"[d]escribe the general development of the business of the\r\nregistrant.\"  17 C.F.R.  229.101(a).  Plaintiffs argue that Item\r\n101(a) by its terms \"required\" the disclosure of the alleged Board-\r\nlevel dispute as to the development of Individual's business. \r\nPlaintiffs raise this argument for the first time in a footnote of\r\ntheir appellate brief.  By failing to raise the applicability of\r\nItem 101(a) in the district court, plaintiffs have waived this\r\nargument.  \"Our law is clear that a party ordinarily may not raise\r\non appeal issues that were not seasonably advanced (and, hence,\r\npreserved) below.\"  See Daigle v. Maine Medical Center, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195171\"><a href=\"/opinion/195171/daigle-v-maine-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).  We thus turn to plaintiffs' second\r\nargument.\r\nThis argument is to the effect that defendants had a\r\n\"specific obligation\" to disclose the Board-level conflict because\r\nits omission rendered affirmative statements in the registration\r\nstatement misleading.  In making this argument, plaintiffs point to\r\ntwo sections of the registration statement: (1) the \"business\r\nmodel\" section, and (2) the \"use of proceeds\" section.\r\nThe \"business model\" section of the prospectus states\r\nthat the Company's objective is:\r\nto build the industry's leading 'open\r\ninformation exchange' linking a growing base\r\nof knowledge workers to relevant information\r\nproviders and advertisers.  The Company\r\nbelieves that the value of this exchange will\r\nincrease as the Company enhances its knowledge\r\nprocessing systems and expands its base of\r\nparticipants.  An expanding set of information\r\nproviders will make the services more\r\ncompelling for knowledge workers.  A larger\r\nuser base will generate additional readership\r\nand revenues for information providers. \r\nIncreased participation of advertisers, who\r\nbenefit from a larger user base and a growing\r\nnumber of information topics, will help to\r\nreduce subscription costs, leading to further\r\nexpansion of the Company's user base.\r\n\n                         . . .\r\n\nThe Company believes the mutually reinforcing\r\ndynamics of its business model are key to\r\nsustaining its growth and meeting its\r\nstrategic objectives.\r\n\nPlaintiffs argue that this statement is materially misleading\r\nbecause it fails to disclose that, at the time the statement was\r\nmade, Individual's \"business model\" was the subject of profound\r\ndisagreement between Amram and the majority of the Board.  Indeed,\r\naccording to the complaint, Amram's growth through acquisition\r\nstrategy was directly contrary to the Company's stated \"business\r\nmodel\" of growing the Company by developing its existing core\r\nbusiness.  Even accepting these allegations as true -- as we must\r\non a motion to dismiss -- we conclude that the omission of the\r\nconflict between Amram and the Board does not render the \"business\r\nmodel\" section of the prospectus misleading.\r\nIn short, the \"business model\" section of the prospectus,\r\ntaken as a whole, is true.  According to plaintiffs' complaint, the\r\nmajority of the Board was committed to growing the Company by\r\nbuilding on its existing core business.  Disclosure of the\r\nbusiness strategy supported by a majority of the directors did not\r\nobligate defendants also to disclose information about the extent\r\nto which each individual Board member supported that model.  Cf.Backman v. Polaroid, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546070\"><a href=\"/opinion/546070/fed-sec-l-rep-p-95389-irving-a-backman-v-polaroid-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">910</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[E]ven a\r\nvoluntary disclosure of information that a reasonable investor\r\nwould consider material must be 'complete and accurate.'  This,\r\nhowever, does not mean that by revealing one fact about a product,\r\none must reveal all others that, too, would be interesting, market-\r\nwise.\").  More specifically, disclosure of the business strategy\r\nsupported by the majority of the Board did not obligate defendants\r\nalso to disclose the fact that Amram -- a distinct minority of a\r\nmulti-member Board -- opposed that strategy.  Cf. id.\r\nThe \"use of proceeds\" section of Individual's prospectus\r\nstates that a portion of the net proceeds from the IPO will be used\r\nfor \"general corporate purposes,\" as well as \"the acquisition of\r\nbusinesses, services and technologies that are complementary to\r\nthose of the Company.\"  Plaintiffs argue that this statement is\r\nmisleading because it fails to disclose that, at the time the\r\nstatement was made, Amram and the Board could not agree on what\r\nacquisitions were \"complementary to those of the Company\" nor on\r\nthe pace at which such acquisitions should be made.  We conclude\r\nthat the omission of Amram's conflict with the majority of the\r\nBoard did not render the \"use of proceeds\" section misleading. \r\nLike the \"business model\" section, the \"use of proceeds\" section of\r\nthe prospectus is complete and accurate on its face.  \r\nFirst, disclosure of the majority of the Board's\r\nintention to use the IPO proceeds for complementary acquisitions\r\ndid not obligate defendants also to disclose Amram's different\r\nviews concerning the types of acquisitions Individual should\r\npursue.  Cf. Backman, 910 F.2d at 16.  Second, the Company's\r\nadherence to the purpose stated in the \"use of proceeds\" section\r\nrendered that section accurate.  Indeed, the complaint alleges that\r\nAmram resigned due to the Board's summary rejection of his proposal\r\nthat the Company contribute 100,000 shares of Individual stock to\r\nFree Spirits Holdings, a non-complementary business combination\r\nthat Amram planned to establish.\r\nIn sum, both the \"business model\" section and the \"use of\r\nproceeds\" section were complete and accurate.  Because the omission\r\nof the Board-level conflict did not render either section\r\nmisleading, we agree with the district court that  11 did not\r\nimpose on defendants a duty of disclosure.\r\n6.  Section 15\r\nSection 15 of the 1933 Act establishes joint and several\r\nliability for \"controlling persons\"--that is, those who exercise\r\ncontrol over primary violators of  11.  15 U.S.C.  770.  A\r\nnecessary element of a  15 claim is a primary violation of  11. \r\nSee, e.g., SEC v. First Jersey Securities, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1450</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n1472 (2d Cir. 1996).  Because plaintiffs have failed to state a\r\nclaim for such a primary violation, they have also failed to state\r\na claim under  15.  See Berliner v. Lotus Dev. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1362033\"><a href=\"/opinion/1362033/berliner-v-lotus-development-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">783</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712-13 (D. Mass. 1992).\r\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint for failure to state a\r\nclaim.\r\n</pre>",
