This is  an  appeal from  a district\r                                 \r\n\ncourt  judgment  affirming  a decision  of  the  Secretary of\r\n\nHealth  and  Human  Services  denying  appellant's claim  for\r\n\ndisability benefits.   The claim was filed  more than twenty-\r\n\none years after  the alleged onset of  appellant's disability\r\n\ndue to injuries  sustained in an automobile  accident shortly\r\n\nbefore  the  expiration  of his  insured  status.   Appellant\r\n\nalleged   a  continuous  disability  from  the  date  of  the\r\n\naccident, September  6, 1967  through February  3, 1989,  the\r\n\ndate of his first  application for benefits.  The application\r\n\nwas initially denied  by an Administrative Law  Judge (\"ALJ\")\r\n\nwhose decision was affirmed by the Appeals Council.  The case\r\n\nwas remanded to the Secretary by the district court, however,\r\n\nwith  instructions   to  secure   an  expert   cardiologist's\r\n\nassessment of the extent and duration of appellant's injuries\r\n\nand functional limitations.  \r\n\n          On   remand,  after   considering  expert   medical\r\n\nevidence  and testimony, and reviewing the entire record, the\r\n\nALJ1 concluded  that appellant's occupational  impairment did\r               1\r\n\nnot meet the  durational requirement of the statute.   See 42\r                                                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1The ALJ to whom the remanded case was initially  assigned\r               1\r\npassed away  after the  hearing.  A  second ALJ  reviewed the\r\nhearing tape, and the entire record, before issuing a lengthy\r\nand  detailed decision.   Appellant, who has  been vigorously\r\nrepresented   by    counsel   throughout,   has    filed   an\r\n\"informational motion\" objecting  to this decisional sequence\r\nfor the first time on this appeal.   Construed as a motion to\r\nsupplement appellant's brief and the  issues on appeal, it is\r\ndenied. \r                  \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nU.S.C.    423(d)(1)(A).  Appellant had to establish the onset\r\n\nof a disability before the  expiration of his insured status,\r\n\nwhich  precluded  all  substantial  gainful  activity  for  a\r\n\ncontinuous  period of not less  than twelve months.   Id.  An\r                                                                    \r\n\nexpert   cardiologist  testified,   however,  that   although\r\n\nappellant's injuries  initially were  disabling, the  average\r\n\nrecuperative period from the ensuing heart surgery, which was\r\n\nperformed  in February,  1968,  was six  months.   After  six\r\n\nmonths, an average patient would  have been able to engage in\r\n\nsedentary work.   Whether  appellant had needed  a longer  or\r\n\nshorter  than  average  recuperative  period  could  not   be\r\n\ndetermined without contemporaneous medical evaluations. There\r\n\nwere   no  contemporaneous   evaluations,  however,   because\r\n\nappellant did  not seek any  medical treatment  after he  was\r\n\ndischarged  from the  hospital, on  or about  June  28, 1968,\r\n\nuntil shortly before he filed his application, nearly twenty-\r\n\none  years  later.    Medical   tests  at  the  time  of  the\r\n\napplication, the  expert opined, revealed  a lingering  heart\r\n\ncondition  which,  nonetheless,  did not  preclude  sedentary\r\n\nwork.\r\n\n             A review  of the  record by  this court  reveals\r\n\nsubstantial  evidence to  support  the Secretary's  decision.\r\n\nAppellant argues that  since his injuries prevented  him from\r\n\nresuming his  past relevant  work, the  regulatory burden  of\r\n\ngoing forward with the evidence  shifted to the Secretary  to\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nshow that appellant could perform other jobs available in the\r\n\nnational economy.  The rules regarding the burden of proof in\r\n\nSocial  Security  cases,  however,  \"resist translation  into\r\n\nabsolutes.\"  Pelletier  v. Secretary, 525 F.2d  158, 161 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1975) (observing  that flexibility is  required because\r\n\nSocial Security cases  are not strictly adversarial).   Here,\r\n\nthe  Secretary produced the best available evidence given the\r\n\ntwenty-one year divide between appellant's relevant  physical\r\n\ncondition  and  the Secretary's  first opportunity  to assess\r\n\nit.2    The  expert's testimony,  coupled  with  the negative\r               2\r\n\ninference  that arose  from claimant's  failure  to seek  any\r\n\nmedical  treatment in  the  interim,  see  Irlanda  Ortiz  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSecretary of HHS, 955  F.2d 765, 767 (1st Cir. 1991), and the\r                            \r\n\nmore current  assessments of appellant's heart  condition and\r\n\nphysical  capacity,  constitutes  substantial  evidence.   In\r\n\nthese circumstances, although  a different  inference may  be\r\n\npossible, the ALJ's choice among the competing inferences was\r\n\na reasonable one.   See Rodriguez Pagan v.  Secretary of HHS,\r                                                                        \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   2Although appellant said  that once, in 1968,  he inquired\r               2\r\nabout applying for Social Security benefits and was dissuaded\r\nby an unidentified employee, this one inquiry, if it occurred\r\nat all, would not have alerted the Secretary to the existence\r\nof appellant's claim.  See  Schweiker v. Hansen, 450 U.S. 785\r                                                           \r\n(1981)  (affirming then prevailing rule that Secretary is not\r\nestopped  in such circumstances  from insisting on  a written\r\napplication  \"essential   to   the   honest   and   effective\r\nadministration of the Social Security laws\"); cf. 20 C.F.R.  \r                                                             \r\n404.633  (1994) (requiring  detailed  proof  to  establish  a\r\nretroactive, \"deemed,\"  filing date  based on  misinformation\r\nallegedly provided by an employee after 1982).    \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n819 F.2d 1, 3  (1st Cir. 1987),  cert. denied, 484 U.S.  1012\r                                                         \r\n\n(1988); Lizotte v.

Here,\r\n\nthe  Secretary produced the best available evidence given the\r\n\ntwenty-one year divide between appellant's relevant  physical\r\n\ncondition  and  the Secretary's  first opportunity  to assess\r\n\nit.2    The  expert's testimony,  coupled  with  the negative\r               2\r\n\ninference  that arose  from claimant's  failure  to seek  any\r\n\nmedical  treatment in  the  interim,  see  Irlanda  Ortiz  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSecretary of HHS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577108\"><a href=\"/opinion/577108/victor-j-irlanda-ortiz-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (1st Cir. 1991), and the\r                            \r\n\nmore current  assessments of appellant's heart  condition and\r\n\nphysical  capacity,  constitutes  substantial  evidence.
