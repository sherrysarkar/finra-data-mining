Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n         Coffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Luis Rafael Rivera on brief for appellants.\n     Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Miguel A. Fernandez\nand Isabel Muñoz-Acosta, Assistant United States Attorneys, on\nbrief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       January 26, 2001\n\f\f            Per Curiam.     On September 5, 1997, the United States\n\ncommenced a forfeiture action in the United States District\n\nCourt    for   the    District   of   Puerto   Rico.    In   its    verified\n\ncomplaint,     the    government   described    a   particular     parcel   of\n\nimproved land (Rural Lot No. 10,356) in Islote Ward, Arecibo,\n\nPuerto Rico (the Property), alleged that the Property had been\n\nused to facilitate the distribution of narcotics in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. § 856(a),1 and claimed that the Property therefore was\n\nforfeitable under 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(7).             The claimants, Nitza\n\nLaFuente-Rivera and Gregorio Rosa-Medina, opposed the petition\n\nfor forfeiture (denying that the Property had been used to\n\nfacilitate     drug     trafficking,    notwithstanding      Rosa-Medina's\n\nconviction for federal narcotics offenses) and timely filed a\n\nclaim.\n\n\n\n\n    1   This statute renders it unlawful to —\n\n         (1) knowingly open or maintain any place for the\n    purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any\n    controlled substance;\n         (2) manage or control any building, room, or\n    enclosure, either as an owner, lessee, agent,\n    employee,    or   mortgagee,    and   knowingly    and\n    intentionally rent, lease, or make available for use,\n    with or without compensation, the building, room, or\n    enclosure for the purpose of unlawfully manufacturing,\n    storing,   distributing,   or   using   a   controlled\n    substance.\n\n21 U.S.C. § 856(a).\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            In due course, the United States moved for summary\n\njudgment.     The claimants filed an objection.                  Ruling on the\n\npapers, the district court granted summary judgment in the\n\ngovernment's favor on February 24, 1999.                   Rosa-Medina did not\n\nappeal from the final order of forfeiture.                     LaFuente-Rivera\n\ninitially    filed    a    notice     of    appeal,   but    failed     to   follow\n\nthrough; we subsequently dismissed her appeal (No. 99-1512) for\n\nwant of prosecution.\n\n            On July 13, 1999, the claimants moved for relief from\n\njudgment.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).             The district court denied\n\ntheir request.       This appeal followed.\n\n            We need not tarry.         On appeal, the claimants argue only\n\nthat the lower court should have set aside the judgment of\n\nforfeiture    under       Federal    Rule     of   Civil    Procedure    60(b)(4)\n\n(authorizing the district court to relieve a party from a final\n\njudgment if \"the judgment is void\").                   At the core of their\n\nargument is the contention that the district court's judgment is\n\nvoid because the government, in its complaint for forfeiture,\n\nidentified    the     \"wrong\"       parcel    of   real     estate    (and    that,\n\ntherefore, the district court should have granted their motion\n\nto set aside that judgment).\n\n            In support of this contention, the claimants make a\n\nplausible    showing      that   the    criminal      activity   of     which   the\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fgovernment complains occurred not on the Property, but on an\n\nadjacent parcel of real estate (owned by Rosa-Medina's sister).\n\nWe reluctantly conclude, however, that this showing comes too\n\nlate.   \"A motion for relief from judgment cannot be used merely\n\nto reargue a point already decided.\"         Barrett v. Lombardi, ___\n\nF.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2001) [Nos. 00-1834, 00-1835, slip op.\n\nat 10].     By the same token, such a motion cannot serve as a\n\nsurrogate for a direct appeal.       Cotto v. United States, 993 F.2d\n\n274, 278 (1st Cir. 1993).          Against this well-defined legal\n\nbackdrop, courts routinely have held parties to the predictable\n\nconsequences     of   allowing   adverse   parties   to   configure   the\n\nrecord.     E.g., Kelly v. United States, 924 F.2d 355, 358 (1st\n\nCir. 1991).\n\n            This tendency has been particularly pronounced in cases\n\ninvolving Rule 60(b)(4).         In application, that rule has been\n\nconfined to a narrow class of cases.         \"A judgment is void, and\n\ntherefore subject to relief under Rule 60(b)(4), only if the\n\ncourt     that   rendered   judgment     lacked   jurisdiction   or   in\n\ncircumstances in which the court's action amounts to a plain\n\nusurpation of power constituting a violation of due process.\"\n\nUnited States v. Boch Oldsmobile, Inc., 909 F.2d 657, 661 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (emphasis omitted).         This extreme condition does not\n\nobtain here:     the United States duly commenced the forfeiture\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\faction, the district court plainly had jurisdiction over it,\n\nservice was properly effected, and the government proffered a\n\nprima   facie   showing   of   probable   cause   to   believe   that   the\n\nProperty was subject to forfeiture.          See United States v. 15\n\nBosworth St., ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2001) [No. 00-1215,\n\nslip op. at 8].     The claimants' opposition to the motion for\n\nsummary judgment raised the misidentification question, but\n\nfailed to persuade.       The claimants have offered no convincing\n\nreason why they should be allowed to raise the point anew.\n\n           In our view, the key to this appeal is that the\n\nidentity of the parcel to which the probable cause showing\n\npertained was not jurisdictional but, rather, merely an element\n\nof the government's case.       Consequently, the district court had\n\npower to rule on the government's complaint and declare the\n\nProperty   forfeit.        Even   taking    the    claimants'     current\n\nallegations as true (for argument's sake), the most that can be\n\nsaid is that the district court erred in granting the summary\n\njudgment motion.    This is clearly not enough:          an error in the\n\nexercise of jurisdiction is simply not the same thing as a total\n\nlack of jurisdiction — and only the latter demands judicial\n\nintervention under Rule 60(b)(4).           See id. at 661-62.          Put\n\nbluntly, a judgment is not void simply because it is or may have\n\n                                   -6-\n\fbeen erroneous; it is void only if, from its inception, it was\n\na legal nullity.        Id. at 661.\n\n             We need go no further.             The only issue cognizable on\n\nthis appeal is the propriety vel non of the district court's\n\ndenial of the motion for relief from judgment.                       See Hoult v.\n\nHoult, 57 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995) (confirming that, on an\n\nappeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion, the court of\n\nappeals      \"may    not       consider   the     merits    of   the    underlying\n\njudgment\").         On that issue we hold, without serious question,\n\nthat the district court did not err in refusing to grant the\n\nrequested relief.          Although we are not without some sympathy for\n\nthe claimants' position, the initial judgment was not a nullity.\n\nThe   real    problem      —    if   there   is   one   —   arises     out   of   the\n\nclaimants' failure diligently to pursue a direct appeal from the\n\nsummary judgment order.               In this sense, then, they are the\n\nauthors of their own misfortune.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f",
