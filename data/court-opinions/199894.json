Defendant the City of Lowell (\"City\"),\n\nclaiming immunity to punitive damages under City of Newport v. Fact\n\nConcerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247 (1981), appeals from a judgment of\npunitive damages in a suit filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000).                 A\n\ndivided panel of this court affirmed on March 29, 2002, agreeing\n\nwith the district court that the City's objection had been waived.\nWe vacated the panel opinion pending rehearing en banc, and now\n\nreverse.     The facts taken in the light most hospitable to the\n\nverdict winner,     Nat'l Ass'n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d\n\n622, 625 (1st Cir. 1995), are as follows.\n\n             On February 7, 1997, Craig Chestnut and his wife went to\n\na bar in Lowell, Massachusetts.           City police officers Steven Coyle\n\nand   Stephen   Ciavola    were     also    present    when   Chestnut   became\nembroiled in a fracas.      Coyle arrested and handcuffed Chestnut and\n\nremoved him from the bar, whereupon Ciavola struck Chestnut in the\n\nface, knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face.                   As a\nresult of Ciavola's violent conduct, Chestnut required fourteen\n\nstitches around his right eye, which is permanently damaged.                  This\n\ninjury impairs Chestnut's long-range depth perception and precludes\n\nhim   from   earning   a   living    as    a   crane   operator,   as    he    did\n\npreviously.\n\n             Chestnut filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 together with\n\nsupplemental state law negligence claims against the City, Coyle\n\nand Ciavola, alleging inter alia that (1) Ciavola used excessive\n\nforce against him; (2) Coyle, after having taken Chestnut into\n\npolice custody, failed to protect him; and (3) the City improperly\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fhired and retained Ciavola, who had an extensive criminal record\n\n(including convictions for assault and battery) and was, at the\n\ntime of hire, the subject of an active arrest warrant for failure\nto appear in court for violating his probation.\n\n           As the trial drew to a close, the district court held a\n\nconference with the attorneys on May 22, 2000 to discuss jury\ninstructions and the verdict form, which included a question on\n\npunitive   damages.       The   court   raised   with   counsel    the\n\nappropriateness of a punitive damages award under section 1983.\n\nChestnut's attorney replied that such an award was appropriate, and\n\nthe City's counsel did not respond to the judge's inquiry or take\n\nissue with opposing counsel's response.    In due course, the trial\n\njudge instructed the jury, without objection, that it could award\npunitive damages against each defendant, including the City, as to\n\nthe section 1983 claim.\n\n           On May 23, the jury returned a verdict for Chestnut on\nboth the negligence and section 1983 counts against Ciavola and the\n\nCity.   The jury did not find Coyle liable on either count; it\n\nawarded Chestnut $750,000 in damages: $500,000 in punitive damages\n\nagainst the City, $40,000 in punitive damages against Ciavola, and\n\n$210,000 in compensatory damages against both of these defendants\n\njointly and severally.    The district court entered judgment, again\n\nwithout objection from the City.\n\n           Finally awakening to its oversight of City of Newport on\n\nMay 25, the City filed a motion for a new trial, or, in the\n\nalternative, to strike the $500,000 of punitive damages.          At a\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fmotion hearing on July 12, 2000, the district court, ruling from\n\nthe bench, denied the City's motion.                Although recognizing that an\n\naward of punitive damages against a municipality was indeed error\nin light of City of Newport, the district court found that the\n\nCity's failure to interpose a timely objection under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 51 waived its immunity.           These appeals followed.1\n               In relying upon \"waiver,\" the district court assuredly\n\ndid not mean that the City knowingly relinquished its immunity\n\nunder City of Newport to punitive damages; there is no evidence\n\nwhatsoever      that    the   City’s   counsel          knew   of   City   of   Newport.\n\nRather, the district judge clearly meant, in the term used in\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733 (1993), that the City had\n\n\"forfeited\" its objection through ignorance or neglect.                         Although\nmost judges, and many Supreme Court decisions, continue to use the\n\nterm       \"waiver\"    to   cover   both    situations,         the   distinction     is\n\nimportant in this case and we will follow Olano’s convention in\n\nthis instance.\n\n               Failures to object, unless a true waiver is involved, are\nalmost always subject to review for plain error.                      This is so even\n\nin the case of jury instructions where Rule 51's current language\n\nsuggests       otherwise.2      However,         even    in    criminal    cases,   the\n\n       1\n      The City originally appealed from the denial of its May 25\nmotion. On June 5, 2000, the City filed an additional motion for\na new trial on the ground of inconsistent verdicts. That motion\nwas denied, and the City renewed its notice of appeal. The denial\nof the June 5 motion is no longer at issue in this appeal, and we\nconsolidated these two appeals on August 24, 2000.\n       2\n      This is so by judicial construction in this circuit. Davis\nv. Rennie, 264 F.3d 86, 100-01 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122\n\n                                           -4-\n\frequirements for plain error, set out in Olano itself, 507 U.S. at\n\n732-36, are extremely demanding; and in this circuit, it is rare\n\nindeed for a panel to find plain error in a civil case.                   Still,\nthis case at first blush meets the Olano requirements: error,\n\nplainness, prejudice, and miscarriage of justice or something akin\n\nto it.\n               The district court itself acknowledged the error, its\n\nplainness      is   amply   demonstrated    by   a   contrary   Supreme   Court\n\nprecedent on point (namely, City of Newport) that has been on the\n\nbooks for over twenty years.         Prejudice in the sense of affecting\n\nthe final outcome is also obvious: had the jury been instructed as\n\nto the City's immunity, there almost certainly would not be a\n\n$500,000 judgment against it today, although conceivably the jury\nmight have somewhat increased the compensatory damages.\n\n            This also appears to be the rare civil case where the\n\nmiscarriage of justice requirement is met.            Importantly, the error\nwas caused by the plaintiff as well as the defendant.             Plaintiff's\n\ncounsel, quite erroneously, represented to the district court at\n\nthe   charge    conference    that   punitive    damages   were   permissible\n\nagainst a municipality. This does not excuse the negligence of the\n\nCity’s counsel but it does mean that responsibility for the mistake\n\nis shared--a somewhat unusual circumstance.\n\n\nS. Ct. 1909 (2002); see also 9A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice\n& Procedure, § 2558, at 462 & n.11 (2d ed. 1995). That rule is\ncurrently being amended to make this reservation clear, see\nAdvisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Report\nof the Civil Rules Advisory Committee 62-68 (March 14, 2001,\nrevised Jul. 31, 2001), bringing Rule 51 in line with the normal\npractice in the case of other errors, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 103(d).\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          Further, even without punitive damages, the plaintiff is\n\nstill entitled to full actual damages, which in this case are\n\nsubstantial.   Nor need such damages be reduced by attorneys’ fees\nbecause under section 1983 such fees are separately awarded.           42\n\nU.S.C. § 1988 (2000).      Punitive damages are, in this sense, a\n\nwindfall--and one that here would come at the expense of innocent\ntaxpayers of the City, the very ones for whose benefit City of\n\nNewport adopted the rule giving municipalities such an immunity.\n\n453 U.S. at 267.\n\n          The main hitch with the plain error doctrine is that City\n\nof Newport described the protection against punitive damages as an\n\n\"immunity,\" rather than as a \"rule\" forbidding punitive damages.\n\nAccordingly, as an immunity need not be asserted, one could argue\nthat the instruction was not \"error\" at all, let alone \"plain\n\nerror.\"   A    state,   after   all,   can   waive   sovereign   immunity.\n\nCertainly if counsel for the City had stood up and said that the\nCity preferred to face punitive damages, it could hardly complain\n\nif the judge took the City at its word.\n\n          Still, this is surely a matter of form over substance.\n\nFor all practical purposes, the district court made an error, and\n\nthe district court itself acknowledged as much.          If the district\n\njudge had discovered Newport on her own the night before the\n\ninstructions, it is hardly likely that she would have authorized\n\npunitive damages.   And although a state might sometimes choose to\n\nwaive sovereign immunity for policy reasons, hoping to win on the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fmerits, one can hardly imagine a competent lawyer choosing to waive\n\nprotection against punitive damages.\n\n             This    realistic     view     is   not    without    precedent.         In\nO'Connor v. Huard, 117 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522\n\nU.S. 1047 (1998), we reviewed for plain error the defendant's\n\ndefense of qualified immunity, raised for the first time after the\nentry of judgment.          In applying the plain error analysis, we did\n\nnot   find   that     the    defendant      forfeited     her     immunity    by     her\n\nprocedural    default,      but    rather    denied     relief    on   the    lack    of\n\nevidence.     Id. at 17.        We treated a late-filed interposition of\n\nqualified immunity in the same fashion in Lewis v. Kendrick, 944\n\nF.2d 949, 953 (1st Cir. 1991).            See also id. at 956 (Breyer, C.J.,\n\nconcurring).3\n\n             Of course, even if the doctrine of plain error were not\n\nstrictly applicable,         it    is   settled    in    this    circuit     that    \"an\n\nappellate court has discretion, in an exceptional case, to reach\nvirgin issues,\" that is, to relieve a party of a prior forfeiture.\n\nUnited States v. La Guardia, 902 F.2d 1010, 1013 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nRecently we described pertinent factors in Harwood, 69 F.3d at 627-\n\n29 (relieving forfeiture of legislative immunity); most of those\n\nfactors are present here and, although this case, unlike Harwood,\n\ndoes not involve a constitutional issue, neither did Harwood\n\ndisregard     a     governing     and   plainly    applicable       Supreme     Court\n\n      3\n      The approach that we have followed in qualified immunity\ncases seems to accord with the approach in our sister circuits.\nSee, e.g., Kelly v. City of Oakland, 198 F.3d 779, 784-85 (9th Cir.\n1999) (examining a late-filed qualified immunity defense on the\nmerits under the plain error standard).\n\n                                          -7-\n\fprecedent.    See also United States v. Krynicki, 689 F.2d 289, 291-\n\n92 (1st Cir. 1982).       The City asserts that we should simply strike\n\nthe punitive damages award, holding the actual damages award\nintact. Probably, the jury’s actual damages award was uninfluenced\n\nby the large punitives; but given that the City bears much of the\n\nblame for any uncertainty, we think on remand it should be the\nplaintiff’s option whether to have a new trial on actual damages\n\nagainst the City (but not against Ciavola)--a trial in which\n\nplaintiff’s attorneys’ fees will be borne by the City.                See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1988 (2000).         The district court shall set a time within\n\nwhich the plaintiff may make such an election.\n\n             The   judgment   insofar   as   it   awards   punitive   damages\n\nagainst the City is vacated and the matter is remanded for further\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.              Each side will\n\nbear its own costs on this appeal.\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                      - Concurrence follows -\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f              TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Concurring).         Though I arrive\n\nat the same destination as the majority, I choose an alternative\n\nroute to get there -- a route which, in my view, is both less\n\nconceptually troubling and better supported by existing precedent.\n\n              Contrary to the majority opinion, I do not think that\n\nthis case can be resolved by relying on the plain error doctrine.\n\nTaken together, the first two prongs of the plain error standard\n\nrequire the appellant to demonstrate that an obvious error of law\n\noccurred.          See Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-36.          The majority, the\n\nparties, and the district court are of the view that it is a\nforegone conclusion that such an error occurred here.                     Their\n\nsteadfast belief rests on the assumption that the district court's\njury instruction, which made punitive damages available against the\nCity, directly contradicted the Supreme Court's holding in City of\n\nNewport. According to them, City of Newport essentially stands for\nthe proposition that punitive damages are unavailable against a\nmunicipality under § 1983.\n\n              Notwithstanding their belief, however, City of Newport\n\nnever held that punitive damages are unavailable in a § 1983 action\nagainst a municipality.         Rather, the Supreme Court ruled that \"a\n\nmunicipality is immune from punitive damages under § 1983.\"                City\n\nof Newport, 453 U.S. at 271 (emphasis added); accord Saldaña-\n\nSánchez       v.    López-Gerena,   256   F.3d   1,   11   (1st   Cir.   2001)\n\n(characterizing City of Newport as holding that \"as a general rule,\nmunicipalities are immune from punitive damages judgments when sued\n\nunder     §    1983\").       Although     this   distinction      may    appear\n\n                                        -9-\n\finconsequential,         it   is   rather   significant     in     light   of    the\n\ncircumstances of this case.           If the Supreme Court had held that\n\npunitive damages were unavailable against a municipality in a\n§ 1983 suit, then a plaintiff would be filing a frivolous complaint\n\nwere he to sue for such damages.               See Fed. R. Civ. P. 11(b)(2)\n\n(requiring that the claims in a party's complaint be \"warranted by\nexisting    law\").        However,    the   Supreme      Court's    holding     that\n\nmunicipalities are \"immune\" from punitive damages under § 1983 has\n\nslightly different implications.              Immunity, whether qualified or\n\nabsolute, is an affirmative defense that can be forfeited, if not\n\nasserted in a timely manner, or waived.               See Cozzo v. Tangipahoa\n\nParish Council--President Gov't, 279 F.3d 273, 283 (5th Cir. 2002)\n\n(ruling that absolute immunity is an affirmative defense that is\nforfeited if not pleaded); Guzmán-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz, 98 F.3d\n\n664, 667 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"Since immunity must be affirmatively\n\npleaded, it follows that failure to do so can work as a waiver of\nthe defense.\"); O'Neill v. Krzeminski, 839 F.2d 9, 13 (2d Cir.\n\n1988) (holding that a municipality's indemnification agreement with\n\ndefendant constituted a waiver of its municipal immunity defense);\n\nBell v. City of Milwaukee, 746 F.2d 1205, 1271-72 (7th Cir. 1984)\n\n(holding    that    state     indemnification     statute    waived    municipal\n\nimmunity defense with respect to indemnified judgments).                      Thus,\n\nwhereas unavailability implies a limitation on damages altogether,\n\nimmunity,   in     the    doctrinal   sense,    is   a   defense    that   can    be\n\nforfeited or waived.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f             In fact, in Saldaña-Sánchez, we allowed a plaintiff to\n\nseek discovery against a municipality on the claim that the city\n\nhad waived its municipal immunity defense under § 1983.                 256 F.3d\nat 11-12.    Our holding rested on the explicit assumption that the\n\nmunicipal immunity set forth in City of Newport is an affirmative\n\ndefense that can be waived.        See id. at 12 (noting that precedent\nsupports the view that waiver of the municipal immunity defense is\n\npossible).    Moreover, we questioned whether the city had forfeited\n\nits municipal immunity defense by failing to assert it at or before\n\ntrial.    See id. Saldaña-Sánchez thus demonstrates how permeable\n\nmunicipal immunity from punitive damages under § 1983 can be, both\n\nin terms of forfeiture and waiver.\n\n             In the instant case, the City never pled an affirmative\ndefense of immunity in its answer and did not raise this defense at\n\nsummary   judgment   or   trial.   The     City's   failure   to   do    so   can\n\nreasonably be viewed as a forfeiture of that defense.              See, e.g.,\n\nGuzmán-Rivera, 98 F.3d at 667 (holding that the failure of a\n\ngovernment official to timely assert an affirmative defense of\n\nqualified immunity under § 1983 at trial would forfeit the defense\n\nfor trial purposes). I therefore cannot conclude that the district\n\ncourt committed plain error in charging the jury that punitive\n\ndamages were available against the City.            To hold otherwise would\n\nrequire me to adopt two seemingly implausible propositions: (1)\n\nthat the Supreme Court's holding in City of Newport was perfectly\n\nclear that no punitive damages are ever available under § 1983; and\n\n(2) that Saldaña-Sánchez, which supports the proposition that\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fmunicipal immunity can be forfeited, was so obviously incorrect as\n\na matter of law that the district court should not have relied on\n\nit.    See generally United States v. Turman, 122 F.3d 1167, 1171\n(9th   Cir.    1997)      (\"If   the   district    judge     would   have   to   be\n\nclairvoyant to detect the error . . . the error is not plain and\n\ndefendant must object as a condition for having it considered on\nappeal.\").\n\n              Rather than delving into an abyss of implausibility, I\n\nhold firm to the view that the district court did not commit plain\n\nerror in its jury instructions because the City failed to assert,\n\nand thus likely forfeited, its affirmative defense of municipal\n\nimmunity from punitive damages.\n\n              The majority contends that \"this [argument] is surely a\nmatter of form over substance.\"              The majority elaborates on this\n\npoint by offering a hypothetical: if the night before the jury\n\ninstructions were given the district court judge had discovered the\nCity of Newport opinion, \"it is hardly likely that [the judge]\n\nwould have authorized punitive damages.\"                 I respectfully disagree\n\nand    offer    a    derivation      of    the   majority's    hypothetical      to\n\ndemonstrate my point: if the night before the jury instructions\n\nwere   given,       the   district     court     judge    obtained   a   complete\n\ndescription of the state of the law -- that is, discovered the\n\nmunicipal \"immunity\" to punitive damages set forth in City of\n\nNewport and learned about our opinion in Saldaña-Sánchez, which\n\nexplicitly discusses how the City of Newport immunity defense can\n\nbe waived or forfeited -- I am convinced that the judge would have\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\finstructed the jury that punitive damages were available, since the\n\nCity failed to assert its immunity defense at any stage of the\n\nlitigation.\n           Notwithstanding my unwillingness to find plain error, I\n\nbelieve that there is an alternative, and more principled, ground\n\nfor   striking       the   punitive    damages       award      against    the   City.\nOrdinarily, a party who fails to raise a claim or a defense in the\n\ndistrict court is prohibited from unveiling it in the court of\n\nappeals.     See United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).   \"This rule is deeply embedded in our jurisprudence, and we\n\nhave invoked it with a near-religious fervor.\" Harwood, 69 F.3d at\n\n627 (internal citations omitted). However, every rule speaks of an\n\nexception,      and    this    one    is    no    different.        In    exceptional\ncircumstances and to prevent a miscarriage of justice, this Court\n\nmay   relieve    a    party    from    his       failure   to    timely    assert   an\n\naffirmative defense.          See, e.g., Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco, 69\n\nF.3d 1184, 1196 (1st Cir. 1995); see generally La Guardia, 902 F.2d\n\nat 1013 (holding that \"an appellate court has discretion, in an\n\nexceptional case, to reach virgin issues\").\n\n           In Harwood, we reached the merits of a legislative\n\nimmunity defense even though the defendants failed to raise the\n\nissue in the district court.                69 F.3d at 627-29.            We found it\n\nappropriate to reach the untimely immunity issue because: (1) the\n\nomitted issue was purely legal in nature; (2) the belated proffer\n\nraised an issue of constitutional magnitude; (3) the omitted\n\nargument was highly persuasive; (4) there was no inequity or\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fspecial prejudice to the plaintiffs in allowing the defense to be\n\nraised for the first time on appeal; (5) the omission seemed\n\nentirely inadvertent; and (6) the omitted issue implicated a matter\nof great public concern.   See id.; see also Krynicki, 689 F.2d at\n\n291-92 (allowing a party to raise a virgin issue on appeal because\n\n(1) the issue was purely legal; (2) the omitted argument was highly\npersuasive; (3) the omitted issue was likely to arise again in\n\nother cases; and (4) the failure to address the issue would result\n\nin a miscarriage of justice).\n\n          Because I believe that these factors are more than\n\nadequately represented in this case, I would excuse the City's\n\nfailure to raise its municipal immunity defense below.       First,\n\nwhether the City should be immune from the $500,000 punitive\ndamages award is a purely legal issue, cf. Harwood, 69 F.3d at 627\n\n(discussing the issue of legislative immunity as \"purely legal in\n\nnature\"), and the record necessary to resolve it can be developed\nno further.   See La Guardia, 902 F.2d at 1013 (\"[Whether] the point\n\ncan be resolved with certitude on the existing record . . . [is] a\n\nfactor that often inclines a court to entertain a pivotal argument\n\nfor the first time on appeal.\"). Second, the omitted issue is\n\nhighly persuasive -- that is, if the City is allowed to raise its\n\nmunicipal immunity defense, it would undoubtedly prove victorious\n\non the issue given the Supreme Court's holding in City of Newport.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f            Third, Chestnut would not suffer any procedural inequity\n\nor special prejudice were we to address this issue.4                Plaintiff\n\naddressed the omitted issue in his brief and set forth his claims\nat oral argument.     Cf. Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 120 (1976)\n\n(discussing importance, in determining whether to reach an omitted\n\nissue, of ensuring that the opposing party \"ha[s] the opportunity\nto present whatever legal arguments he may have\" to the court of\n\nappeals).     Thus, the absence of unfairness weighs in favor of\n\naddressing the omitted issue.\n\n            Fourth,    the   City's    failure   to   raise   its   municipal\n\nimmunity defense seems entirely inadvertent. Although the omission\n\nhad the regrettable effect of prolonging the trial, it did not\n\nproduce any tactical advantage to the defendant.\n            Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, the failure to\n\naddress the City's municipal immunity defense would result in a\n\nmiscarriage    of     justice.   \"[P]unitive     damages      imposed   on   a\nmunicipality . . . are likely accompanied by an increase in taxes\n\nor a reduction of public services for the citizens footing the\n\nbill.\"   City of Newport, 453 U.S. at 267.            It is convoluted and\n\nunfair to impose the burdens of a punitive damages award on the\n\n\n     4\n      Though plaintiff would be stripped of his punitive damages\naward if the City is allowed to assert its municipal immunity\ndefense on appeal, that prejudice is not the type contemplated by\nthis factor. Rather, we examine whether the plaintiff would suffer\nany procedural unfairness if we address the omitted issue. See\nHarwood, 69 F.3d at 629 (stating that plaintiffs would not suffer\nany \"special prejudice or inequity\" by addressing the omitted\nissue, despite the fact that reaching the issue on appeal meant\nthat the injunction that plaintiffs obtained in the lower court\nwould be vacated).\n\n                                      -15-\n\fsame taxpayers and citizens for whose benefit the wrongdoer was\n\nbeing chastised.       See id.    Punishing blameless taxpayers for the\n\nineptitude of the City's attorney is simply unjust, especially\nconsidering that the taxpayers are in no position to deter similar\n\nnegligence in the future.\n\n            Because all of these factors converge in the City's\nfavor, I would excuse the City's failure to assert its immunity\n\ndefense below and proceed to address the merits of the defense.                In\n\nCity   of   Newport,    the    Supreme      Court   unequivocally    held   that\n\nmunicipalities are immune from punitive damages in § 1983 actions.\n\n453 U.S. at 271.       Chestnut can advance no argument, and I cannot\n\nconceive of any, to attack this proposition.                  On this basis, I\n\nwould find that the City's defense precludes the punitive damages\naward in this case, and I would strike those damages.\n\n            I   therefore     concur   in     the   outcome   of   the   majority\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                              - Dissent Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, with whom CYR, Senior Circuit\n\nJudge, joins, dissenting.    I can understand the impulse to grant\n\nrelief to the City here. Together, plaintiff's counsel and counsel\n\nfor the City failed to recognize the well-established principle\nthat local governmental entities are immune from punitive damages\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.     City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc.,\n\n453 U.S. 247 (1981).      A very able trial judge also missed the\nmistake.   Hence, the jury awarded $500,000 in punitive damages\n\nagainst the City.\n\n           No one disputes that, under City of Newport, the City\ncould have avoided such an award.   But that easy avoidance does not\njustify relieving the City of the consequences of its mistake.\nWhether we treat the City's oversight as a failure to raise the\n\naffirmative defense of City of Newport immunity, or as a failure to\n\nobject to a jury instruction under Rule 51, we must affirm the\njury's verdict unless we conclude that allowing the punitive\n\ndamages award to stand would constitute a \"miscarriage of justice.\"\nUntil today, we have reserved that label for \"extraordinary\" cases.\nTeamsters, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).     Indeed, it appears that we have never before\n\nfound a miscarriage of justice in a civil case involving faulty\n\njury instructions.   See Davis   v. Rennie, 264 F.3d 86, 100-01 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).   The circumstances of this case give us no reason to\n\ndepart from that settled practice.       Therefore, I respectfully\n\ndissent.\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f                                 I.\n\n          The majority and concurring opinions cite several factors\n\nto support their conclusion that allowing the punitive damages\n\naward to stand would result in a miscarriage of justice.       In my\n\nview, those factors -- either individually or in combination --\n\nfall far short of a miscarriage of justice.\n\n          A.     Innocent Taxpayers\n\n          Both the majority and the concurring opinions emphasize\n\nthat affirming the punitive damages award would be unjust because\n\nit would punish innocent taxpayers.     See City of Newport, 453 U.S.\nat 267.   Those references to innocent taxpayers seem to have\nmultiple meanings.   The taxpayers are innocent in the sense that\nthey did not engage in the conduct that the punitive damages are\n\nintended to punish and deter.   Instead, the taxpayers -- who do not\nneed to be deterred from future misconduct -- must pay for the\nmisdeeds of governmental actors.      The taxpayers also are innocent\n\nin the sense that they did not make the mistake in litigation that\nresulted in the punitive damages award.     Instead, that mistake was\nmade by the City's counsel.\n          Both versions of the innocence argument prove too much.\n\nThe first version, focusing on the absence of deterrence, is simply\n\na restatement of a policy reason invoked by the Supreme Court for\n\nthe rule that municipalities are immune from punitive damages under\n\n§ 1983.   If that policy reason translates into a miscarriage of\n\njustice in every case where punitive damages are wrongly awarded\n\nagainst a municipality, there should be no pretense of a multi-\n\n                                -18-\n\ffactor     analysis    in    such   cases.     Certainly,        this    version   of\n\ninnocence does not distinguish one such case from another.\n\n               On an even more basic level, the innocent taxpayer will\nalways be the victim when some error at trial results in a large\n\n(or     larger)    damages    award    against    a    municipality       or    other\n\ngovernmental entity.         Thus -- unless we are prepared to recognize\na local-government exception to our rules governing procedural\n\ndefault -- the mere fact that innocent taxpayers will bear the\n\nbrunt of the City's error cannot suffice to establish a miscarriage\n\nof justice here.5\n\n               The second version of the innocence argument suffers from\n\na similar defect in failing to distinguish this case from any other\n\ncase subject to plain error review.              There are few tenets so well\nestablished in American jurisprudence as the proposition that a\n\nclient is bound by the mistakes of its chosen counsel.                   See, e.g.,\n\nIrwin     v.   Dept.   of   Veterans   Affairs,       498   U.S.   89,    92   (1990)\n(explaining        that      in     \"our      system        of     representative\n\nlitigation . . . each party is deemed bound by the acts of his\nlawyer-agent\"); Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"We\n\nhave repeatedly held that the acts and omissions of counsel are\n\n      5\n       Consistent with that view, federal courts in other contexts\nhave refused to allow public entities to belatedly raise an\naffirmative   defense to damages, notwithstanding the impact on\ninnocent taxpayers. See, e.g., Bentley v. Cleveland County Bd. of\nCounty Comm'rs., 41 F.3d 600, 604-05 (10th Cir. 1994) (concluding\nthat county, having failed to raise affirmative defense of $100,000\nstatutory damages cap in discrimination suit until after $157,000\nverdict was rendered, forfeited its right to that defense);\nIngraham v. United States, 808 F.2d 1075, 1079 (5th Cir. 1987)\n(barring government from belatedly raising statutory cap on medical\nmalpractice damages).\n\n                                       -19-\n\fcustomarily visited upon the client in a civil case.\" (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).      Plain error review offers an exception\n\nto that general rule for extraordinary cases. Obviously, the plain\nerror standard -- and particularly the requirement that relief will\n\nnot be available absent a \"miscarriage of justice\" -- cannot be\n\nsatisfied simply because the complaining party (or those who\nultimately    bear   its   costs)   will   be   harmed   by   its   attorney's\n\nmistake.      To hold otherwise would deprive the miscarriage of\n\njustice requirement of any meaning, except in the very rare case\n\nwhere the error was caused by the party itself.\n\n             Put simply, the harm to innocent taxpayers here is no\n\ndifferent from the harm that will occur whenever punitive damages\n\nare erroneously awarded against a municipality under § 1983, or\nwhen government counsel makes a costly blunder. While unfortunate,\n\nsuch harm does not constitute a \"peculiar circumstance[]\" that\n\nnecessitates relief in order to \"prevent a clear miscarriage of\njustice.\"    Nimrod v. Sylvester, 369 F.2d 870, 873 (1st Cir. 1966).\n\n            B.       Windfall to Chestnut\n\n            The majority opinion states that the court is justified\nin affording relief because this punitive damages award was a\n\n\"windfall\" for Chestnut, meaning, I gather, that those damages were\nunnecessary to compensate him fully. That assertion is grounded in\nspeculation.     We cannot know how the jury would have treated the\n\ncompensatory damages question had it had been aware that punitive\ndamages were unavailable.\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f            One thing is very clear, however. This was not a runaway\n\njury. To the contrary, Chestnut presented detailed evidence of the\n\npay differential between his income as a crane operator and as a\ncrane mechanic, including expert testimony from an economist who\n\nplaced his past and future economic damages at $880,000.                       That\n\nexpert prepared a report that was admitted into evidence regarding\npresent value calculations of Chestnut's economic damages under\n\nvarious assumptions.\n\n            Thus, considered in combination with the compensatory\n\ndamages award, the punitive damages were well within the range of\n\nthe compensable injury Chestnut sought to establish at trial. Only\n\nby ignoring reality can it be suggested, as the majority does, that\n\nthe   compensatory       damages      award    to   Chestnut        probably    was\n\"uninfluenced    by     the   large     punitives.\"     Rather,       absent    the\n\navailability of punitive damages, the jury may well have awarded\n\nChestnut substantially more in compensatory damages.                 We should be\nmost reluctant to grant relief on the basis of an alleged windfall\n\nwhen we are unable to determine whether -- and to what extent -- it\n\nactually occurred.\n\n            C.        Shared Responsibility for the Error\n\n            The majority emphasizes that Chestnut's counsel played a\nrole in causing the error -- a circumstance that it describes as\n\"somewhat   unusual.\"         I   see    nothing    unusual    in    such   shared\n\nresponsibility.       In the process of assisting the judge with jury\ninstructions,     the    parties        routinely   submit     their     proposed\n\ninstructions.    Not uncommonly, one party fails to see an error in\n\n                                        -21-\n\fthe other party's proposed instructions until after an unfavorable\n\nverdict.      The objection is then raised, subject to plain error\n\nreview.    In that circumstance, both parties share responsibility\nfor the error.      However, until today, that fact has not entered the\n\nmiscarriage of justice analysis.\n\n              The reason is fairly simple. In any case involving plain\nerror review, the appellant will argue that the court below made an\n\nerror that was so plain or obvious that it should be corrected\n\nnotwithstanding the litigants' failure to point it out. Therefore,\n\nas a matter of simple logic, it cannot possibly be enough that\n\nopposing counsel failed to call the court's attention to a clear\n\nlegal error or even said affirmatively that there was no error.6\n\nThat will be true in any case that makes it past the first prong of\n\nthe   plain    error   test;   something     more   is   needed   in    order   to\n\nestablish a miscarriage of justice.\n\n              In   addition    to   being    inconsistent    with      the   well-\nestablished plain error standard, the majority's reasoning is also\n\nunfair.    In our adversary system, counsel for the City had the\n\nobligation to understand the law and advocate effectively for its\n\nclient.       It seems odd to equate Chestnut's mistake with the\n\nnegligence of the City.         To do so unjustly penalizes Chestnut for\n\nfailing to protect the interests of the City, his adversary in\n\nlitigation.\n\n\n      6\n      There is no suggestion in the record that Chestnut's counsel\nknowingly misrepresented the availability of punitive damages to\nthe court. If there was such a knowing misrepresentation, this\nwould be an entirely different case.\n\n                                      -22-\n\f            D.        Precedent\n\n            In a final attempt to justify the grant of relief here,\n\nthe majority cites Nat'l Ass'n of Social Workers v. Harwood, 69\n\nF.3d 622 (1st Cir. 1995).           There, as here, we gave the appellants\n\nthe   benefit    of    a   governmental        immunity   notwithstanding     their\n\nfailure to raise that defense at trial.                   But that is where the\n\nparallel ends.        The appellants in Harwood were state legislators,\n\nand   the   affirmative         defense   they     tardily   invoked    was   state\n\nlegislative immunity.           That kind of immunity is notably different\n\nfrom the immunity to punitive damages at issue here.\n            First, recognizing that legislative immunity is grounded\n\nin constitutional doctrine, we noted in Harwood that \"[w]hen the\nJustices initially recognized state legislative immunity as a\ncomponent of federal common law, they turned to the Speech or\n\nDebate Clause [U.S. Const. art. I., § 6, cl. 1] for guidance anent\nthe contours of the doctrine.\" Harwood, 69 F.3d at 629.                   The fact\nthat the defense raised \"an issue of constitutional magnitude\" was\n\namong the    factors       we    took   into     consideration   in    deciding   to\nconsider the legislative immunity defense, notwithstanding the\nprocedural default.        Id. at 627.         In contrast, the City of Newport\n\nmunicipal immunity to punitive damages is a purely common law\ndefense, grounded in history and policy considerations.                   See City\n\nof Newport, 453 U.S. at 261 (\"In sum, we find that considerations\n\nof history and policy do not support exposing a municipality to\npunitive damages for the bad-faith actions of its officials.\").\n\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\f            Second, we explained in Harwood that our decision to\n\nrelieve defendants from their procedural default was \"fortified by\n\nour recognition that a primary purpose of the immunity is to\nprevent     courts   from   intruding   into    precincts    that   are\n\nconstitutionally reserved to the legislative branch.\" 69 F.3d at\n\n628 n.6. Thus, we emphasized that the omitted issue of legislative\nimmunity \"implicates matters of great public moment, and touches\n\nupon policies as basic as federalism, comity, and respect for the\n\nindependence of democratic institutions.\"      Id. at 628.   Relief was\n\nnecessary, we explained, to prevent the intrusion of the judicial\n\nbranch into \"the internal operations of a state legislature.\"       Id.\n\nat 629.\n\n            No such separation-of-powers concerns are implicated\nhere.   Rather, we are faced only with the sort of \"individualized\n\nharm that occurs whenever the failure seasonably to raise a claim\n\nor defense alters the outcome of a case.\"      Id. at 628 n.5.   That is\nnot enough to warrant relief under the \"miscarriage of justice\"\n\nstandard.     Id.\n\n                                 II.\n\n            In sum, the majority's invocation of Harwood -- like its\nemphasis on innocent taxpayers, Chestnut's so-called \"windfall,\"\nand his shared responsibility for the error -- is insufficient to\nqualify this case as extraordinary, or its result as a miscarriage\n\nof justice.    That, in itself, is enough to foreclose relief here.\nBut there is more.    Several other factors counsel strongly against\n\ngranting relief in this case.\n\n                                 -24-\n\f           First, it bears emphasis that the procedural misstep by\n\nthe City was particularly egregious.            The rules set out in City of\n\nNewport, governing immunity from punitive damages, are hardly a\ntrap for the unwary.      To the contrary, the City had -- and ignored\n\n-- repeated opportunities to invoke that immunity.                  Chestnut made\n\nhis intention to seek punitive damages explicit in his complaint\nand then in two subsequent amended complaints. The City never pled\n\nan affirmative defense in its answer to punitive damages under\n\n§ 1983 and did not raise its defense to punitive damages at the\n\npretrial conference.\n\n           During the charge conference conducted prior to closing\n\narguments, the district court specifically asked counsel whether\n\npunitive damages were available against the City.                   Yet again the\nCity failed to assert its immunity defense.                    Cf. Danco, Inc. v.\n\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 178 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1999) (deeming it\n\nmaterial   to    \"plain       error\"    inquiry         that   legal     issue    was\n\"specifically discussed\" before trial court). Following the charge\n\nconference,     the   court    recessed       for   a    lunch   break    prior    to\nentertaining closing arguments, thereby providing counsel with\n\nanother opportunity to review the proposed jury charge and conduct\n\nany legal research suggested thereby.\n\n           During closing argument, Chestnut urged the jury to award\n\npunitive damages against the City.            The City did not object.           Then,\n\nthe district court furnished counsel with the verdict form, which\n\nexplicitly provided for punitive damages against the City.                       Still\n\nthe City neither objected to the verdict form nor asserted its\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fdefense against any award of punitive damages, even though the\n\nproposed charge included an explicit instruction authorizing the\n\njury to   consider    a   punitive   damages      award   against    the   City.\nFinally, although jury deliberations did not commence until the\n\nnext day, which assured that the City had yet more time to examine\n\nthe proposed charge and verdict form and undertake whatever legal\nresearch might be required, the City nevertheless failed to object\n\nto the proposed punitive-damages instruction.\n\n          A \"miscarriage of justice\" claim merits little credence\n\non appeal where the desired relief was so obviously and readily\n\navailable in the trial court.           In my view, a \"miscarriage of\n\njustice\" entails a measure of fundamental unfairness.               There is no\n\nsuch unfairness here, however, given that counsel for the City was\naccorded every conceivable opportunity to oppose the punitive\n\ndamages claim and the related jury instruction.\n\n          Second, \"[i]t counts heavily against finding plain error\nthat the party on the other side would be unfairly prejudiced.\"\n\nId.   Were we simply to vacate the punitive damages award, it is\n\nlikely that Chestnut would be prejudiced.           As explained above, the\n\navailability   of    punitive   damages     may   well    have   affected    the\n\ncompensatory damages award made by the jury.               Consequently, had\n\npunitive damages not been an option, the jury might very well have\n\ndetermined upon a larger compensatory damages award.\n\n          In order to forfend against the prejudice problem, the\n\nmajority refuses to strike the punitive damages award, opting\n\ninstead for a new trial on the issue of damages should Chestnut\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fchoose to pursue that option. Although its approach is surely more\n\njust, it is not without its own difficulties.            The City sought\n\nalternative relief from the trial court:           either (i) that the\npunitive damages award be stricken, leaving in place only the\n\ncompensatory damages, or (ii) a new trial. On appeal, however, the\n\nCity has abandoned its request for alternative relief, opting\ninstead for its all-or-nothing strategy by requesting that we\n\nstrike   the   punitive   damages    award   on   the   ground   that   the\n\navailability of such damages affected neither the presentation of\n\nChestnut's case nor the amount of compensatory damages awarded by\n\nthe jury.\n\n            Although we frequently permit appellees to preserve their\n\ntrial court judgments by affirming on any basis apparent from the\nrecord (thereby furthering the interests of finality), see, e.g.,\n\nMcGurn v. Bell Microproducts, Inc., 284 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n2002), we consistently have held appellants to the arguments raised\nand the relief sought, see, e.g., In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 183\n\nF.3d 71, 73 n.1 (1st Cir. 1999) (declining to consider argument\n\nabandoned on appeal).     Here, on the other hand, the majority, sua\n\nsponte, undoes a jury verdict by ordering a new trial.           Moreover,\n\nin so doing, it once again reaches out to relieve the City of its\n\nfundamental mistake -- its selection of an ineffective appellate\n\nstrategy -- by according relief not sought by the City at the\n\noutset of this appeal.\n\n            Finally, established precedents, in our own and other\n\ncircuits, plainly prescribe that municipalities may forfeit their\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fimmunity defense to punitive damages claims under § 1983 due to\n\ntheir litigation conduct.        For instance, in Saldaña-Sánchez v.\n\nLopez-Gerena, 256 F.3d 1, 11-12 (1st Cir. 2001), we recognized that\nthe defendants' right to raise City of Newport may have been barred\n\non procedural grounds.       Similarly, in Black v. Stephens, 662 F.2d\n\n181, 184 n.1 (3rd Cir. 1981), the Third Circuit affirmed a § 1983\npunitive damages award against the City of Allentown, after having\n\ndeclined to allow the city to assert its City of Newport defense\n\ndue to its failure to do so in the district court.                  See also\n\nBarnett v. Housing Auth. of Atlanta, 707 F.2d 1571, 1579-81 (11th\n\nCir. 1983) (declining to relieve appellant of failure to object to\n\nthe submission of the § 1983 punitive damages issue to the jury,\n\nand   affirming   punitive    damages   award   against   Atlanta    Housing\nAuthority on account of that \"procedural default\"), overruled on\n\nother grounds, McKinney v. Pate, 20 F.3d 1550, 1558-59 (11th Cir.\n\n1994).7   I can discern no sound reason for following a different\ncourse in the instant case.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n        But see Williams v. Butler, 746 F.2d 431, 443-44 (8th Cir.\n1984) (affirming district court decision to set aside § 1983\npunitive damages award despite failure to object to punitive\ndamages instruction at trial), on reh'g, 762 F.2d 73 (8th Cir.\n1985) (en banc), vacated on other grounds sub nom. City of Little\nRock v. Williams, 475 U.S. 1105 (1986), on remand, Williams v.\nButler, 802 F.2d 296 (8th Cir. 1986) (en banc), vacated on other\ngrounds sub nom. City of Little Rock v. Williams, 485 U.S. 931\n(1988), on remand Williams v. Butler, 863 F.2d 1398 (8th Cir. 1988)\n(en banc), cert. denied, City of Little Rock v. Williams, 492 U.S.\n906 (1989).\n\n                                   -28-\n\f                                III.\n\n          This is an awkward case, to be sure.        The punitive\n\ndamages issue should not have been presented to the jury, and the\n\npunitive damages award against the City was plainly contrary to\n\nlaw.   Yet the question with which we are presented is neither\n\nwhether the award amounts to plain error, nor whether the interests\n\nof the City were adversely affected. Instead, the issue is whether\n\nthere was a miscarriage of justice such that the punitive damages\n\naward must be set aside.   For the reasons stated above, I conclude\n\nthat no such miscarriage of justice occurred.   As I see no reason\nto relieve the City of the consequences of its litigation conduct,\n\nthe punitive damages award should stand.\n\n\n\n\n                                -29-\n\f",

City police officers Steven Coyle\n\nand   Stephen   Ciavola    were     also    present    when   Chestnut   became\nembroiled in a fracas.      Coyle arrested and handcuffed Chestnut and\n\nremoved him from the bar, whereupon Ciavola struck Chestnut in the\n\nface, knocked him to the ground and kicked him in the face.                   As a\nresult of Ciavola's violent conduct, Chestnut required fourteen\n\nstitches around his right eye, which is permanently damaged.                  This\n\ninjury impairs Chestnut's long-range depth perception and precludes\n\nhim   from   earning   a   living    as    a   crane   operator,   as    he    did\n\npreviously.\n\n             Chestnut filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 together with\n\nsupplemental state law negligence claims against the City, Coyle\n\nand Ciavola, alleging inter alia that (1) Ciavola used excessive\n\nforce against him; (2) Coyle, after having taken Chestnut into\n\npolice custody, failed to protect him; and (3) the City improperly\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fhired and retained Ciavola, who had an extensive criminal record\n\n(including convictions for assault and battery) and was, at the\n\ntime of hire, the subject of an active arrest warrant for failure\nto appear in court for violating his probation.\n\n           As the trial drew to a close, the district court held a\n\nconference with the attorneys on May 22, 2000 to discuss jury\ninstructions and the verdict form, which included a question on\n\npunitive   damages.       The   court   raised   with   counsel    the\n\nappropriateness of a punitive damages award under section 1983.\n\nChestnut's attorney replied that such an award was appropriate, and\n\nthe City's counsel did not respond to the judge's inquiry or take\n\nissue with opposing counsel's response.    In due course, the trial\n\njudge instructed the jury, without objection, that it could award\npunitive damages against each defendant, including the City, as to\n\nthe section 1983 claim.\n\n           On May 23, the jury returned a verdict for Chestnut on\nboth the negligence and section 1983 counts against Ciavola and the\n\nCity.   The jury did not find Coyle liable on either count; it\n\nawarded Chestnut $750,000 in damages: $500,000 in punitive damages\n\nagainst the City, $40,000 in punitive damages against Ciavola, and\n\n$210,000 in compensatory damages against both of these defendants\n\njointly and severally.    The district court entered judgment, again\n\nwithout objection from the City.\n\n           Finally awakening to its oversight of City of Newport on\n\nMay 25, the City filed a motion for a new trial, or, in the\n\nalternative, to strike the $500,000 of punitive damages.          At a\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fmotion hearing on July 12, 2000, the district court, ruling from\n\nthe bench, denied the City's motion.                Although recognizing that an\n\naward of punitive damages against a municipality was indeed error\nin light of City of Newport, the district court found that the\n\nCity's failure to interpose a timely objection under Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 51 waived its immunity.           These appeals followed.1\n               In relying upon \"waiver,\" the district court assuredly\n\ndid not mean that the City knowingly relinquished its immunity\n\nunder City of Newport to punitive damages; there is no evidence\n\nwhatsoever      that    the   City’s   counsel          knew   of   City   of   Newport.\n\nRather, the district judge clearly meant, in the term used in\n\nUnited States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 733 (1993), that the City had\n\n\"forfeited\" its objection through ignorance or neglect.                         Although\nmost judges, and many Supreme Court decisions, continue to use the\n\nterm       \"waiver\"    to   cover   both    situations,         the   distinction     is\n\nimportant in this case and we will follow Olano’s convention in\n\nthis instance.\n\n               Failures to object, unless a true waiver is involved, are\nalmost always subject to review for plain error.                      This is so even\n\nin the case of jury instructions where Rule 51's current language\n\nsuggests       otherwise.2      However,         even    in    criminal    cases,   the\n\n       1\n      The City originally appealed from the denial of its May 25\nmotion. On June 5, 2000, the City filed an additional motion for\na new trial on the ground of inconsistent verdicts. That motion\nwas denied, and the City renewed its notice of appeal. The denial\nof the June 5 motion is no longer at issue in this appeal, and we\nconsolidated these two appeals on August 24, 2000.\n       2\n      This is so by judicial construction in this circuit. Davis\nv. Rennie, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199586\"><a href=\"/opinion/199586/davis-v-rennie/\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100-01 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 122\n\n                                           -4-\n\frequirements for plain error, set out in Olano itself, 507 U.S. at\n\n732-36, are extremely demanding; and in this circuit, it is rare\n\nindeed for a panel to find plain error in a civil case.                   Still,\nthis case at first blush meets the Olano requirements: error,\n\nplainness, prejudice, and miscarriage of justice or something akin\n\nto it.\n               The district court itself acknowledged the error, its\n\nplainness      is   amply   demonstrated    by   a   contrary   Supreme   Court\n\nprecedent on point (namely, City of Newport) that has been on the\n\nbooks for over twenty years.         Prejudice in the sense of affecting\n\nthe final outcome is also obvious: had the jury been instructed as\n\nto the City's immunity, there almost certainly would not be a\n\n$500,000 judgment against it today, although conceivably the jury\nmight have somewhat increased the compensatory damages.\n\n            This also appears to be the rare civil case where the\n\nmiscarriage of justice requirement is met.            Importantly, the error\nwas caused by the plaintiff as well as the defendant.             Plaintiff's\n\ncounsel, quite erroneously, represented to the district court at\n\nthe   charge    conference    that   punitive    damages   were   permissible\n\nagainst a municipality. This does not excuse the negligence of the\n\nCity’s counsel but it does mean that responsibility for the mistake\n\nis shared--a somewhat unusual circumstance.\n\n\nS. Ct. 1909 (2002); see also 9A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice\n& Procedure, § 2558, at 462 & n.11 (2d ed. 1995). That rule is\ncurrently being amended to make this reservation clear, see\nAdvisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Report\nof the Civil Rules Advisory Committee 62-68 (March 14, 2001,\nrevised Jul. 31, 2001), bringing Rule 51 in line with the normal\npractice in the case of other errors, e.g., Fed. R. Evid. 103(d).\n\n                                      -5-\n\f          Further, even without punitive damages, the plaintiff is\n\nstill entitled to full actual damages, which in this case are\n\nsubstantial.   Nor need such damages be reduced by attorneys’ fees\nbecause under section 1983 such fees are separately awarded.           42\n\nU.S.C. § 1988 (2000).      Punitive damages are, in this sense, a\n\nwindfall--and one that here would come at the expense of innocent\ntaxpayers of the City, the very ones for whose benefit City of\n\nNewport adopted the rule giving municipalities such an immunity.\n\n453 U.S. at 267.\n\n          The main hitch with the plain error doctrine is that City\n\nof Newport described the protection against punitive damages as an\n\n\"immunity,\" rather than as a \"rule\" forbidding punitive damages.\n\nAccordingly, as an immunity need not be asserted, one could argue\nthat the instruction was not \"error\" at all, let alone \"plain\n\nerror.\"   A    state,   after   all,   can   waive   sovereign   immunity.\n\nCertainly if counsel for the City had stood up and said that the\nCity preferred to face punitive damages, it could hardly complain\n\nif the judge took the City at its word.\n\n          Still, this is surely a matter of form over substance.\n\nFor all practical purposes, the district court made an error, and\n\nthe district court itself acknowledged as much.          If the district\n\njudge had discovered Newport on her own the night before the\n\ninstructions, it is hardly likely that she would have authorized\n\npunitive damages.   And although a state might sometimes choose to\n\nwaive sovereign immunity for policy reasons, hoping to win on the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fmerits, one can hardly imagine a competent lawyer choosing to waive\n\nprotection against punitive damages.\n\n             This    realistic     view     is   not    without    precedent.

The City asserts that we should simply strike\n\nthe punitive damages award, holding the actual damages award\nintact. Probably, the jury’s actual damages award was uninfluenced\n\nby the large punitives; but given that the City bears much of the\n\nblame for any uncertainty, we think on remand it should be the\nplaintiff’s option whether to have a new trial on actual damages\n\nagainst the City (but not against Ciavola)--a trial in which\n\nplaintiff’s attorneys’ fees will be borne by the City.                See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1988 (2000).         The district court shall set a time within\n\nwhich the plaintiff may make such an election.\n\n             The   judgment   insofar   as   it   awards   punitive   damages\n\nagainst the City is vacated and the matter is remanded for further\nproceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

Though I arrive\n\nat the same destination as the majority, I choose an alternative\n\nroute to get there -- a route which, in my view, is both less\n\nconceptually troubling and better supported by existing precedent.\n\n              Contrary to the majority opinion, I do not think that\n\nthis case can be resolved by relying on the plain error doctrine.\n\nTaken together, the first two prongs of the plain error standard\n\nrequire the appellant to demonstrate that an obvious error of law\n\noccurred.          See Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-36.          The majority, the\n\nparties, and the district court are of the view that it is a\nforegone conclusion that such an error occurred here.                     Their\n\nsteadfast belief rests on the assumption that the district court's\njury instruction, which made punitive damages available against the\nCity, directly contradicted the Supreme Court's holding in City of\n\nNewport. According to them, City of Newport essentially stands for\nthe proposition that punitive damages are unavailable against a\nmunicipality under § 1983.\n\n              Notwithstanding their belief, however, City of Newport\n\nnever held that punitive damages are unavailable in a § 1983 action\nagainst a municipality.         Rather, the Supreme Court ruled that \"a\n\nmunicipality is immune from punitive damages under § 1983.\"                City\n\nof Newport, 453 U.S. at 271 (emphasis added); accord Saldaña-\n\nSánchez       v.

If the Supreme Court had held that\n\npunitive damages were unavailable against a municipality in a\n§ 1983 suit, then a plaintiff would be filing a frivolous complaint\n\nwere he to sue for such damages.

However,    the   Supreme      Court's    holding     that\n\nmunicipalities are \"immune\" from punitive damages under § 1983 has\n\nslightly different implications.

Thus,\n\nwhereas unavailability implies a limitation on damages altogether,\n\nimmunity,   in     the    doctrinal   sense,    is   a   defense    that   can    be\n\nforfeited or waived.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f             In fact, in Saldaña-Sánchez, we allowed a plaintiff to\n\nseek discovery against a municipality on the claim that the city\n\nhad waived its municipal immunity defense under § 1983.                 256 F.3d\nat 11-12.    Our holding rested on the explicit assumption that the\n\nmunicipal immunity set forth in City of Newport is an affirmative\n\ndefense that can be waived.        See id. at 12 (noting that precedent\nsupports the view that waiver of the municipal immunity defense is\n\npossible).    Moreover, we questioned whether the city had forfeited\n\nits municipal immunity defense by failing to assert it at or before\n\ntrial.    See id. Saldaña-Sánchez thus demonstrates how permeable\n\nmunicipal immunity from punitive damages under § 1983 can be, both\n\nin terms of forfeiture and waiver.\n\n             In the instant case, the City never pled an affirmative\ndefense of immunity in its answer and did not raise this defense at\n\nsummary   judgment   or   trial.   The     City's   failure   to   do    so   can\n\nreasonably be viewed as a forfeiture of that defense.              See, e.g.,\n\nGuzmán-Rivera, 98 F.3d at 667 (holding that the failure of a\n\ngovernment official to timely assert an affirmative defense of\n\nqualified immunity under § 1983 at trial would forfeit the defense\n\nfor trial purposes). I therefore cannot conclude that the district\n\ncourt committed plain error in charging the jury that punitive\n\ndamages were available against the City.            To hold otherwise would\n\nrequire me to adopt two seemingly implausible propositions: (1)\n\nthat the Supreme Court's holding in City of Newport was perfectly\n\nclear that no punitive damages are ever available under § 1983; and\n\n(2) that Saldaña-Sánchez, which supports the proposition that\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fmunicipal immunity can be forfeited, was so obviously incorrect as\n\na matter of law that the district court should not have relied on\n\nit.

We found it\n\nappropriate to reach the untimely immunity issue because: (1) the\n\nomitted issue was purely legal in nature; (2) the belated proffer\n\nraised an issue of constitutional magnitude; (3) the omitted\n\nargument was highly persuasive; (4) there was no inequity or\n\n\n                                           -13-\n\fspecial prejudice to the plaintiffs in allowing the defense to be\n\nraised for the first time on appeal; (5) the omission seemed\n\nentirely inadvertent; and (6) the omitted issue implicated a matter\nof great public concern.

First,\n\nwhether the City should be immune from the $500,000 punitive\ndamages award is a purely legal issue, cf. Harwood, 69 F.3d at 627\n\n(discussing the issue of legislative immunity as \"purely legal in\n\nnature\"), and the record necessary to resolve it can be developed\nno further.   See La Guardia, 902 F.2d at 1013 (\"[Whether] the point\n\ncan be resolved with certitude on the existing record . . . [is] a\n\nfactor that often inclines a court to entertain a pivotal argument\n\nfor the first time on appeal.\"). Second, the omitted issue is\n\nhighly persuasive -- that is, if the City is allowed to raise its\n\nmunicipal immunity defense, it would undoubtedly prove victorious\n\non the issue given the Supreme Court's holding in City of Newport.\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\f            Third, Chestnut would not suffer any procedural inequity\n\nor special prejudice were we to address this issue.4                Plaintiff\n\naddressed the omitted issue in his brief and set forth his claims\nat oral argument.     Cf. Singleton v. Wulff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109530\"><a href=\"/opinion/109530/singleton-v-wulff/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 120 (1976)\n\n(discussing importance, in determining whether to reach an omitted\n\nissue, of ensuring that the opposing party \"ha[s] the opportunity\nto present whatever legal arguments he may have\" to the court of\n\nappeals).     Thus, the absence of unfairness weighs in favor of\n\naddressing the omitted issue.\n\n            Fourth,    the   City's    failure   to   raise   its   municipal\n\nimmunity defense seems entirely inadvertent. Although the omission\n\nhad the regrettable effect of prolonging the trial, it did not\n\nproduce any tactical advantage to the defendant.\n            Fifth, and perhaps most importantly, the failure to\n\naddress the City's municipal immunity defense would result in a\n\nmiscarriage    of     justice.   \"[P]unitive     damages      imposed   on   a\nmunicipality . . . are likely accompanied by an increase in taxes\n\nor a reduction of public services for the citizens footing the\n\nbill.\"   City of Newport, 453 U.S. at 267.

Rather, we examine whether the plaintiff would suffer\nany procedural unfairness if we address the omitted issue. See\nHarwood, 69 F.3d at 629 (stating that plaintiffs would not suffer\nany \"special prejudice or inequity\" by addressing the omitted\nissue, despite the fact that reaching the issue on appeal meant\nthat the injunction that plaintiffs obtained in the lower court\nwould be vacated).\n\n                                      -15-\n\fsame taxpayers and citizens for whose benefit the wrongdoer was\n\nbeing chastised.       See id.    Punishing blameless taxpayers for the\n\nineptitude of the City's attorney is simply unjust, especially\nconsidering that the taxpayers are in no position to deter similar\n\nnegligence in the future.\n\n            Because all of these factors converge in the City's\nfavor, I would excuse the City's failure to assert its immunity\n\ndefense below and proceed to address the merits of the defense.                In\n\nCity   of   Newport,    the    Supreme      Court   unequivocally    held   that\n\nmunicipalities are immune from punitive damages in § 1983 actions.\n\n453 U.S. at 271.       Chestnut can advance no argument, and I cannot\n\nconceive of any, to attack this proposition.                  On this basis, I\n\nwould find that the City's defense precludes the punitive damages\naward in this case, and I would strike those damages.\n\n            I   therefore     concur   in     the   outcome   of   the   majority\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                              - Dissent Follows -\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, with whom CYR, Senior Circuit\n\nJudge, joins, dissenting.    I can understand the impulse to grant\n\nrelief to the City here. Together, plaintiff's counsel and counsel\n\nfor the City failed to recognize the well-established principle\nthat local governmental entities are immune from punitive damages\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.

Hence, the jury awarded $500,000 in punitive damages\n\nagainst the City.\n\n           No one disputes that, under City of Newport, the City\ncould have avoided such an award.   But that easy avoidance does not\njustify relieving the City of the consequences of its mistake.\nWhether we treat the City's oversight as a failure to raise the\n\naffirmative defense of City of Newport immunity, or as a failure to\n\nobject to a jury instruction under Rule 51, we must affirm the\njury's verdict unless we conclude that allowing the punitive\n\ndamages award to stand would constitute a \"miscarriage of justice.\"\nUntil today, we have reserved that label for \"extraordinary\" cases.\nTeamsters, Local No. 59 v.

The circumstances of this case give us no reason to\n\ndepart from that settled practice.       Therefore, I respectfully\n\ndissent.\n\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\f                                 I.\n\n          The majority and concurring opinions cite several factors\n\nto support their conclusion that allowing the punitive damages\n\naward to stand would result in a miscarriage of justice.       In my\n\nview, those factors -- either individually or in combination --\n\nfall far short of a miscarriage of justice.\n\n          A.     Innocent Taxpayers\n\n          Both the majority and the concurring opinions emphasize\n\nthat affirming the punitive damages award would be unjust because\n\nit would punish innocent taxpayers.     See City of Newport, 453 U.S.\nat 267.   Those references to innocent taxpayers seem to have\nmultiple meanings.   The taxpayers are innocent in the sense that\nthey did not engage in the conduct that the punitive damages are\n\nintended to punish and deter.   Instead, the taxpayers -- who do not\nneed to be deterred from future misconduct -- must pay for the\nmisdeeds of governmental actors.      The taxpayers also are innocent\n\nin the sense that they did not make the mistake in litigation that\nresulted in the punitive damages award.     Instead, that mistake was\nmade by the City's counsel.\n          Both versions of the innocence argument prove too much.\n\nThe first version, focusing on the absence of deterrence, is simply\n\na restatement of a policy reason invoked by the Supreme Court for\n\nthe rule that municipalities are immune from punitive damages under\n\n§ 1983.   If that policy reason translates into a miscarriage of\n\njustice in every case where punitive damages are wrongly awarded\n\nagainst a municipality, there should be no pretense of a multi-\n\n                                -18-\n\ffactor     analysis    in    such   cases.     Certainly,        this    version   of\n\ninnocence does not distinguish one such case from another.\n\n               On an even more basic level, the innocent taxpayer will\nalways be the victim when some error at trial results in a large\n\n(or     larger)    damages    award    against    a    municipality       or    other\n\ngovernmental entity.         Thus -- unless we are prepared to recognize\na local-government exception to our rules governing procedural\n\ndefault -- the mere fact that innocent taxpayers will bear the\n\nbrunt of the City's error cannot suffice to establish a miscarriage\n\nof justice here.5\n\n               The second version of the innocence argument suffers from\n\na similar defect in failing to distinguish this case from any other\n\ncase subject to plain error review.              There are few tenets so well\nestablished in American jurisprudence as the proposition that a\n\nclient is bound by the mistakes of its chosen counsel.                   See, e.g.,\n\nIrwin     v.

Plain error review offers an exception\n\nto that general rule for extraordinary cases. Obviously, the plain\nerror standard -- and particularly the requirement that relief will\n\nnot be available absent a \"miscarriage of justice\" -- cannot be\n\nsatisfied simply because the complaining party (or those who\nultimately    bear   its   costs)   will   be   harmed   by   its   attorney's\n\nmistake.

Windfall to Chestnut\n\n            The majority opinion states that the court is justified\nin affording relief because this punitive damages award was a\n\n\"windfall\" for Chestnut, meaning, I gather, that those damages were\nunnecessary to compensate him fully. That assertion is grounded in\nspeculation.     We cannot know how the jury would have treated the\n\ncompensatory damages question had it had been aware that punitive\ndamages were unavailable.\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f            One thing is very clear, however. This was not a runaway\n\njury. To the contrary, Chestnut presented detailed evidence of the\n\npay differential between his income as a crane operator and as a\ncrane mechanic, including expert testimony from an economist who\n\nplaced his past and future economic damages at $880,000.                       That\n\nexpert prepared a report that was admitted into evidence regarding\npresent value calculations of Chestnut's economic damages under\n\nvarious assumptions.\n\n            Thus, considered in combination with the compensatory\n\ndamages award, the punitive damages were well within the range of\n\nthe compensable injury Chestnut sought to establish at trial. Only\n\nby ignoring reality can it be suggested, as the majority does, that\n\nthe   compensatory       damages      award    to   Chestnut        probably    was\n\"uninfluenced    by     the   large     punitives.\"     Rather,       absent    the\n\navailability of punitive damages, the jury may well have awarded\n\nChestnut substantially more in compensatory damages.                 We should be\nmost reluctant to grant relief on the basis of an alleged windfall\n\nwhen we are unable to determine whether -- and to what extent -- it\n\nactually occurred.\n\n            C.        Shared Responsibility for the Error\n\n            The majority emphasizes that Chestnut's counsel played a\nrole in causing the error -- a circumstance that it describes as\n\"somewhat   unusual.\"         I   see    nothing    unusual    in    such   shared\n\nresponsibility.       In the process of assisting the judge with jury\ninstructions,     the    parties        routinely   submit     their     proposed\n\ninstructions.    Not uncommonly, one party fails to see an error in\n\n                                        -21-\n\fthe other party's proposed instructions until after an unfavorable\n\nverdict.      The objection is then raised, subject to plain error\n\nreview.    In that circumstance, both parties share responsibility\nfor the error.      However, until today, that fact has not entered the\n\nmiscarriage of justice analysis.\n\n              The reason is fairly simple. In any case involving plain\nerror review, the appellant will argue that the court below made an\n\nerror that was so plain or obvious that it should be corrected\n\nnotwithstanding the litigants' failure to point it out. Therefore,\n\nas a matter of simple logic, it cannot possibly be enough that\n\nopposing counsel failed to call the court's attention to a clear\n\nlegal error or even said affirmatively that there was no error.6\n\nThat will be true in any case that makes it past the first prong of\n\nthe   plain    error   test;   something     more   is   needed   in    order   to\n\nestablish a miscarriage of justice.\n\n              In   addition    to   being    inconsistent    with      the   well-\nestablished plain error standard, the majority's reasoning is also\n\nunfair.    In our adversary system, counsel for the City had the\n\nobligation to understand the law and advocate effectively for its\n\nclient.       It seems odd to equate Chestnut's mistake with the\n\nnegligence of the City.         To do so unjustly penalizes Chestnut for\n\nfailing to protect the interests of the City, his adversary in\n\nlitigation.\n\n\n      6\n      There is no suggestion in the record that Chestnut's counsel\nknowingly misrepresented the availability of punitive damages to\nthe court. If there was such a knowing misrepresentation, this\nwould be an entirely different case.\n\n                                      -22-\n\f            D.        Precedent\n\n            In a final attempt to justify the grant of relief here,\n\nthe majority cites Nat'l Ass'n of Social Workers v. Harwood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707518\"><a href=\"/opinion/707518/national-association-of-social-workers-v-john-b-harwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1995).           There, as here, we gave the appellants\n\nthe   benefit    of    a   governmental        immunity   notwithstanding     their\n\nfailure to raise that defense at trial.                   But that is where the\n\nparallel ends.        The appellants in Harwood were state legislators,\n\nand   the   affirmative         defense   they     tardily   invoked    was   state\n\nlegislative immunity.           That kind of immunity is notably different\n\nfrom the immunity to punitive damages at issue here.\n            First, recognizing that legislative immunity is grounded\n\nin constitutional doctrine, we noted in Harwood that \"[w]hen the\nJustices initially recognized state legislative immunity as a\ncomponent of federal common law, they turned to the Speech or\n\nDebate Clause [U.S. Const. art. I., § 6, cl. 1] for guidance anent\nthe contours of the doctrine.\" Harwood, 69 F.3d at 629.                   The fact\nthat the defense raised \"an issue of constitutional magnitude\" was\n\namong the    factors       we    took   into     consideration   in    deciding   to\nconsider the legislative immunity defense, notwithstanding the\nprocedural default.        Id. at 627.         In contrast, the City of Newport\n\nmunicipal immunity to punitive damages is a purely common law\ndefense, grounded in history and policy considerations.                   See City\n\nof Newport, 453 U.S. at 261 (\"In sum, we find that considerations\n\nof history and policy do not support exposing a municipality to\npunitive damages for the bad-faith actions of its officials.\").\n\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\f            Second, we explained in Harwood that our decision to\n\nrelieve defendants from their procedural default was \"fortified by\n\nour recognition that a primary purpose of the immunity is to\nprevent     courts   from   intruding   into    precincts    that   are\n\nconstitutionally reserved to the legislative branch.\" 69 F.3d at\n\n628 n.6. Thus, we emphasized that the omitted issue of legislative\nimmunity \"implicates matters of great public moment, and touches\n\nupon policies as basic as federalism, comity, and respect for the\n\nindependence of democratic institutions.\"      Id. at 628.   Relief was\n\nnecessary, we explained, to prevent the intrusion of the judicial\n\nbranch into \"the internal operations of a state legislature.\"       Id.\n\nat 629.\n\n            No such separation-of-powers concerns are implicated\nhere.   Rather, we are faced only with the sort of \"individualized\n\nharm that occurs whenever the failure seasonably to raise a claim\n\nor defense alters the outcome of a case.\"      Id. at 628 n.5.   That is\nnot enough to warrant relief under the \"miscarriage of justice\"\n\nstandard.     Id.\n\n                                 II.\n\n            In sum, the majority's invocation of Harwood -- like its\nemphasis on innocent taxpayers, Chestnut's so-called \"windfall,\"\nand his shared responsibility for the error -- is insufficient to\nqualify this case as extraordinary, or its result as a miscarriage\n\nof justice.    That, in itself, is enough to foreclose relief here.\nBut there is more.    Several other factors counsel strongly against\n\ngranting relief in this case.\n\n                                 -24-\n\f           First, it bears emphasis that the procedural misstep by\n\nthe City was particularly egregious.            The rules set out in City of\n\nNewport, governing immunity from punitive damages, are hardly a\ntrap for the unwary.      To the contrary, the City had -- and ignored\n\n-- repeated opportunities to invoke that immunity.                  Chestnut made\n\nhis intention to seek punitive damages explicit in his complaint\nand then in two subsequent amended complaints. The City never pled\n\nan affirmative defense in its answer to punitive damages under\n\n§ 1983 and did not raise its defense to punitive damages at the\n\npretrial conference.\n\n           During the charge conference conducted prior to closing\n\narguments, the district court specifically asked counsel whether\n\npunitive damages were available against the City.                   Yet again the\nCity failed to assert its immunity defense.                    Cf. Danco, Inc. v.\n\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764359\"><a href=\"/opinion/764359/danco-inc-and-benjamin-guiliani-appelleescross-appellants-v-wal-mart/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 1999) (deeming it\n\nmaterial   to    \"plain       error\"    inquiry         that   legal     issue    was\n\"specifically discussed\" before trial court). Following the charge\n\nconference,     the   court    recessed       for   a    lunch   break    prior    to\nentertaining closing arguments, thereby providing counsel with\n\nanother opportunity to review the proposed jury charge and conduct\n\nany legal research suggested thereby.\n\n           During closing argument, Chestnut urged the jury to award\n\npunitive damages against the City.            The City did not object.           Then,\n\nthe district court furnished counsel with the verdict form, which\n\nexplicitly provided for punitive damages against the City.                       Still\n\nthe City neither objected to the verdict form nor asserted its\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fdefense against any award of punitive damages, even though the\n\nproposed charge included an explicit instruction authorizing the\n\njury to   consider    a   punitive   damages      award   against    the   City.\nFinally, although jury deliberations did not commence until the\n\nnext day, which assured that the City had yet more time to examine\n\nthe proposed charge and verdict form and undertake whatever legal\nresearch might be required, the City nevertheless failed to object\n\nto the proposed punitive-damages instruction.\n\n          A \"miscarriage of justice\" claim merits little credence\n\non appeal where the desired relief was so obviously and readily\n\navailable in the trial court.           In my view, a \"miscarriage of\n\njustice\" entails a measure of fundamental unfairness.               There is no\n\nsuch unfairness here, however, given that counsel for the City was\naccorded every conceivable opportunity to oppose the punitive\n\ndamages claim and the related jury instruction.\n\n          Second, \"[i]t counts heavily against finding plain error\nthat the party on the other side would be unfairly prejudiced.\"\n\nId.   Were we simply to vacate the punitive damages award, it is\n\nlikely that Chestnut would be prejudiced.           As explained above, the\n\navailability   of    punitive   damages     may   well    have   affected    the\n\ncompensatory damages award made by the jury.               Consequently, had\n\npunitive damages not been an option, the jury might very well have\n\ndetermined upon a larger compensatory damages award.\n\n          In order to forfend against the prejudice problem, the\n\nmajority refuses to strike the punitive damages award, opting\n\ninstead for a new trial on the issue of damages should Chestnut\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fchoose to pursue that option. Although its approach is surely more\n\njust, it is not without its own difficulties.            The City sought\n\nalternative relief from the trial court:           either (i) that the\npunitive damages award be stricken, leaving in place only the\n\ncompensatory damages, or (ii) a new trial. On appeal, however, the\n\nCity has abandoned its request for alternative relief, opting\ninstead for its all-or-nothing strategy by requesting that we\n\nstrike   the   punitive   damages    award   on   the   ground   that   the\n\navailability of such damages affected neither the presentation of\n\nChestnut's case nor the amount of compensatory damages awarded by\n\nthe jury.\n\n            Although we frequently permit appellees to preserve their\n\ntrial court judgments by affirming on any basis apparent from the\nrecord (thereby furthering the interests of finality), see, e.g.,\n\nMcGurn v. Bell Microproducts, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199886\"><a href=\"/opinion/199886/mcgurn-v-bell-microproducts/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (1st Cir.\n\n2002), we consistently have held appellants to the arguments raised\nand the relief sought, see, e.g., In re Grand Jury Proceedings, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198604\"><a href=\"/opinion/198604/in-re-grand-jury-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 73 n.1 (1st Cir. 1999) (declining to consider argument\n\nabandoned on appeal).     Here, on the other hand, the majority, sua\n\nsponte, undoes a jury verdict by ordering a new trial.           Moreover,\n\nin so doing, it once again reaches out to relieve the City of its\n\nfundamental mistake -- its selection of an ineffective appellate\n\nstrategy -- by according relief not sought by the City at the\n\noutset of this appeal.\n\n            Finally, established precedents, in our own and other\n\ncircuits, plainly prescribe that municipalities may forfeit their\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fimmunity defense to punitive damages claims under § 1983 due to\n\ntheir litigation conduct.

Yet the question with which we are presented is neither\n\nwhether the award amounts to plain error, nor whether the interests\n\nof the City were adversely affected.

For the reasons stated above, I conclude\n\nthat no such miscarriage of justice occurred.   As I see no reason\nto relieve the City of the consequences of its litigation conduct,\n\nthe punitive damages award should stand.\n\n\n\n\n                                -29-\n\f</pre>",
