Carlos Angel Muoz-Amado\r\n(\"Muoz\") appeals from his convictions for conspiracy: (1) to\r\npossess with intent to distribute multi-kilogram quantities of\r\ncocaine on board a vessel of the United States, in violation of 46\r\nU.S.C.  1903 (j) &amp; (f); and (2) to import multi-kilogram\r\nquantities of cocaine into the United States, in violation of 21\r\nU.S.C.  952(a) &amp;  953.  Muoz argues that his speedy trial rights\r\nunder the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C.  3161, and the Sixth\r\nAmendment were violated.\r\n                   BACKGROUND\r\nWe recount only the critical chain of events central to\r\nthis appeal.  On November 15, 1995, a Puerto Rico grand jury\r\nreturned a three count indictment against Muoz and Mario Saavedra\r\ncharging them with violations of various narcotics laws.  Muoz was\r\narrested in Miami, Florida on November 17, 1995.  Muoz first\r\nappeared before the United States District Court for the Southern\r\nDistrict of Florida on November 17, 1995.  On November 20, 1995, a\r\ndetention hearing was held at which the court ordered Muoz held on\r\n$500,000 bail.  A removal hearing was held on November 27, 1995. \r\nAt the hearing, the court ordered the removal and transportation of\r\nMuoz to the United States District Court for the District of\r\nPuerto Rico.  On January 25, 1996, Muoz made his initial\r\nappearance before the district court for the District of Puerto\r\nRico.  On February 5, 1996, Muoz was arraigned and pled not guilty\r\nto all three counts of the indictment.\r\nMuoz filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy\r\ntrial on June 26, 1996.  He filed a second motion to dismiss on the\r\nsame grounds on June 17, 1997.  Both motions were denied.  On\r\nJune 19, 1997, a jury trial commenced.  On July 1, 1997, Muoz was\r\nconvicted on all three counts.  The district court sentenced Muoz\r\nto: (1) 324 months of imprisonment on each count, to be served\r\nconcurrently; (2) a supervised term of release of five years as to\r\neach count, to be served concurrently; and (3) a fine of $10,000 as\r\nto each count, and a special monetary assessment of $100 as to each\r\ncount.\r\n                   DISCUSSION\r\nI.  Speedy Trial Act Claim\r\nThe Speedy Trial Act (\"STA\") is designed \"to protect a\r\ndefendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial, and to serve\r\nthe public interest in bringing prompt criminal proceedings.\" \r\nUnited States v. Scantleberry-Frank, 158 F.3d 612, 614 (1st Cir.\r\n1998) (quoting United States v. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d 11, 15\r\n(1st Cir. 1997)).  The STA provides that the government must bring\r\na criminal defendant to trial no more than seventy days after the\r\nlater of the filing date of the information or indictment, or the\r\ndate on which the criminal defendant first appears before a\r\njudicial officer of a court in which the charge is pending.  See 18\r\nU.S.C.  3161(c)(1).  In calculating the seventy days, the STA\r\nexcludes certain time periods.  See 18 U.S.C.  3161(h)(1)-(9); \r\nsee also Scantleberry-Frank, 158 F.3d at 614.  If a criminal\r\nindictment is not brought to trial within the time limit imposed by\r\n3161(c)(1), as extended by operation of  3161(h)(1)-(9), the\r\npenalty provisions of the STA mandate that \"the information or\r\nindictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.\" 18\r\nU.S.C.  3162(a)(2).  This Court reviews the disposition of an STA\r\nissue for clear error as to factual findings and de novo as to\r\nlegal rulings.  See United States v. Rodrguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1162\r\n(1st Cir. 1995).\r\nWe begin at the beginning.  The preeminent question in\r\nthis case is: when did time begin to accrue for STA purposes?\r\nSection 3161(c)(1) requires that a defendant be tried within\r\nseventy days of the occurrence of one of two events:  the filing of\r\nthe indictment or the defendant's appearance \"before a judicial\r\nofficer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever\r\ndate last occurs.\"  18 U.S.C.  3161(c)(1).  Relying on 18 U.S.C.\r\n3161(h)(1)(H) (which provides that any unreasonable delay\r\nresulting from the transfer of a defendant be included in STA\r\ncalculations and mandating that any such delay in excess of ten\r\ndays from the date of the order directing transportation and the\r\ndefendant's arrival at the destination be presumed unreasonable),\r\nMuoz argues that the STA clock began to run on November 27, 1995,\r\nwhen he was ordered removed to Puerto Rico, and that only ten days\r\nof the period between the removal order and his January 25, 1996\r\nappearance should be excluded from the STA calculation.  The\r\ngovernment counters that the STA clock began to run on January 25,\r\n1996, when Muoz first appeared before a judicial officer in Puerto\r\nRico.\r\nMuoz's reliance on this  3161(h)(1)(H) to establish a\r\nviolation of the STA in his case is misplaced. Section \r\n3161(h)(1)(H) is a tolling provision, not one that sets forth the\r\nevents that trigger the start of the seventy-day period in which a\r\ntrial must be held.  Section  3161(c)(1) clearly states that \"the\r\ntrial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment with\r\nthe commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days\r\nfrom the filing date (and making public) of the information or\r\nindictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a\r\njudicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending,\r\nwhichever date last occurs.\" (emphasis added).  Muoz first\r\nappeared before a judicial officer of the District of Puerto Rico\r\non January 26, 1995.  The delay resulting from the transfer of\r\nMuoz from Miami to Puerto Rico (the court in which the charges\r\nwere pending) thus took place well before the STA clock even began\r\nto run.  See United States v. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).  As a result, there was no STA violation.\r\nII.  Sixth Amendment Claim\r\n Muoz contends that the delay in his being brought to\r\ntrial violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial.  We find\r\nno merit in this contention.\r\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution\r\nprovides, in pertinent part, that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\r\nthe accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial.\" \r\nU.S. Const. amend. VI.  This right attaches upon arrest or\r\nindictment, whichever occurs first.  See United States v.\r\nMacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1982); United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d\r\n1058, 1061 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Colombo, 852 F.2d 19,\r\n23 (1st Cir. 1988). For Sixth Amendment purposes, Muoz is entitled\r\nto a computation of time from November 15, 1995, the date of his\r\nindictment.\r\nThat there was no violation of the STA in this case does\r\nnot necessarily preclude a court from finding a violation of\r\nMuoz's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.  See United States\r\nv. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir. 1997).  Section\r\n3173 of the STA states that \"[n]o provision of this chapter shall\r\nbe interpreted as a bar to any claim of denial of speedy trial as\r\nrequired by amendment VI of the Constitution.\"  18 U.S.C.  3173; \r\nsee also United States v. Mitchell, 723 F.2d 1040, 1049 (1st Cir.\r\n1983).  \"It would be, however, 'an unusual case in which the time \r\nlimits of the [STA] have been met but the [S]ixth [A]mendment right\r\nto speedy trial has been violated.'\"  Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1049\r\n(quoting United States v. Nance, 666 F.2d 353, 360 (9th Cir.\r\n1982)). This court reviews a district court's speedy trial\r\ndetermination under the Sixth Amendment for abuse of discretion. \r\nSee Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 21.\r\nIn Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530-33 (1972), the\r\nSupreme Court established a four-part balancing test to be used in\r\ndetermining whether a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy\r\ntrial has been violated.  A court should consider:  (1) the length\r\nof the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the defendant's\r\nassertion of his speedy trial right; and (4) the prejudice to the\r\ndefendant caused by the delay.  See Barker, 407 U.S. at 530.  \"None\r\nof these factors is 'either a necessary or sufficient condition to\r\nthe finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial.  Rather,\r\nthey are related factors and must be considered together with such\r\nother circumstances as may be relevant.'\"  United States v. Henson,\r\n945 F.2d 430, 437 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at\r\n533).\r\nThe first factor, the length of the delay, was identified\r\nby the Supreme Court as: \r\n         to some extent a triggering mechanism.  Until\r\nthere is some delay which is presumptively\r\nprejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry\r\ninto the other factors that go into the\r\nbalance. Nevertheless, because of the\r\nimprecision of the right to speedy trial, the\r\nlength of delay that will provoke such an\r\ninquiry is necessarily dependent upon the\r\npeculiar circumstances of the case. For\r\nexample, the delay that can be tolerated for\r\nan ordinary street crime is less than for a\r\nserious, complex conspiracy charge.\r\n\nBarker, 407 U.S. at 530-31.  The Supreme Court has said that \"the\r\nlower courts have generally found postaccusation delay\r\n'presumptively prejudicial' at least as it approaches one year.\" \r\nDoggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647, 652 n.1 (1992) (citations\r\nomitted).  We shall assume, under the foregoing, that the nineteen\r\nmonth delay in this case was \"presumptively prejudicial\" so as to\r\ntrigger further inquiry.  See, e.g., Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at\r\n21 (assuming that a fifteen month delay was presumptively\r\nprejudicial so as to trigger further inquiry); Colombo, 852 F.2d at\r\n24 (holding that a twenty-four month delay was long enough to be\r\npresumptively prejudicial).  Still, we hold that the cumulative\r\neffect of the pretrial delay, viewed under all the factors set\r\nforth in Barker, falls short of establishing a Sixth Amendment\r\nviolation.\r\nOnce an examination of the Sixth Amendment claim is\r\ntriggered, the weight given in the analysis to the length of the\r\ndelay depends upon the extent to which the delay exceeds the bare\r\nminimum considered presumptively prejudicial.  See Doggett, 505\r\nU.S. at 652.  Muoz waited over nineteen months for the\r\ncommencement of trial in this case, a case more complicated than\r\n\"an ordinary street crime\" but less so than \"a serious, complex\r\nconspiracy charge.\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 531.  Arguably, therefore,\r\nthe period of the delay was long enough to tip the scales slightly\r\nin favor of Muoz's claim.\r\nThe second factor, the reasons for the delay, has been\r\ncalled, \"the focal inquiry.\"  Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 22\r\n(citation omitted).  As with the first factor, \"[h]ere, too,\r\ndifferent weights should be assigned to different reasons.\" \r\nBarker, 407 U.S. at 531.  Muoz argues that the chief reason for\r\nthe delay was the two month period from the time Muoz was ordered \r\nremoved from the Southern District of Florida until his appearance\r\nbefore a judicial officer in the District of Puerto Rico.  Even\r\nacknowledging the fact that the government cannot simply buy Muoz\r\na coach ticket on an airline and immediately place him on a flight\r\nto San Juan, two months seems to be quite a long time to transport\r\nan inmate from South Florida to San Juan.\r\nThat said, Muoz ignores the role his many pretrial\r\nmotions played in causing the nineteen month delay between his\r\nindictment and the jury trial.  His many motions included: (1) a\r\nmotion for Luis Plaza to withdraw as attorney, and to extend the\r\ntime to announce new counsel (3/11/96); (2) a motion to transfer\r\nthe case to the Southern District of Florida (6/11/96); (3) a\r\nmotion requesting the mandatory disqualification or recusal of the\r\ntrial judge and a change of venue (6/24/96); (4) a motion to compel\r\nthe government to administer polygraph examinations to witnesses\r\n(6/24/96); (5) a pro se motion to dismiss the indictment alleging\r\ngovernment misconduct, destruction of exculpatory evidence, and\r\nprosecutorial misconduct (7/2/96); (6) a pro se motion to dismiss\r\nthe indictment alleging government misconduct and seeking to compel\r\nthe government to disclose a personnel file, information, and\r\nsupplementary evidence (7/10/96); (7) a pro se motion to dismiss\r\nthe indictment alleging violation of due process and constitutional\r\nrights (7/15/96); (8) a pro se motion for the setting of a hearing\r\n(7/15/96); (9) a pro se motion for additional discovery and Jencks\r\nAct material (7/26/96); (10) a pro se motion to suppress evidence\r\n(7/26/96); (11) a motion for Joseph Laws to withdraw as attorney\r\n(7/29/96); and (12) a motion for Joseph Laws to withdraw as\r\nattorney (11/15/96).\r\nThe third factor, the defendant's assertion of his speedy \r\ntrial right, \"is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in\r\ndetermining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.\" \r\nBarker, 407 U.S. 531-32.  A defendant should give some indication,\r\nprior to his assertion of a speedy trial violation, that he wishes\r\nto proceed to trial.  See Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 22.\r\nThe defendant filed two motions to dismiss for lack of a\r\nspeedy trial.  The first was filed on June 26, 1996, and the second\r\nwas filed at the eleventh hour before trial on June 17, 1997.  In\r\nbetween the two motions, as the above catalogue of actions\r\nillustrates, Muoz demonstrated a \"lack of enthusiasm for the\r\nspeedy trial right which he now asserts.\"  Henson, 945 F.2d at 438\r\n(1st Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\r\nThe fourth factor -- the prejudice to the defendant\r\ncaused by the delay -- \"should be assessed in the light of the\r\ninterests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed\r\nto protect.  Th[e] Court has identified three such interests: (i)\r\nto prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize\r\nanxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the\r\npossibility that the defense will be impaired.\"  Barker, 407 U.S.\r\nat 532 (footnote omitted).\r\nThe Barker Court went on to discuss the disadvantages of\r\nlengthy pretrial incarceration for the accused who cannot obtain\r\nhis release.  See Barker, 407 U.S. at 532-33.  However, the\r\nnineteen months of pretrial incarceration in this case, by itself,\r\nis insufficient to establish a constitutional level of prejudice. \r\nCf. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 23 (stating that \"fifteen months\r\nof pretrial incarceration was insufficient to establish a\r\nconstitutional level of prejudice\").\r\nMuoz does not allege any anxiety or concern resulting\r\nfrom his pretrial delay so we immediately turn to the third and\r\nfinal factor.\r\n\"Among the three interests safeguarded by the right to\r\nspeedy trial as guaranteed under the [S]ixth [A]mendment, 'the most\r\nserious is [protection against impairment of the defense] because\r\nthe inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews\r\nthe fairness of the entire system.'\"  Barker, 407 U.S. at 532\r\n(citations omitted).\r\nMuoz claims in a conclusory fashion that he \"suffered\r\nprejudice while incarcerated.  In the interim . . . witnesses left\r\nthe country and were not available for trial.\"  Appellant's Br. at\r\n19.  Nowhere does he delineate: (1) the alleged prejudice he\r\nsuffered; (2) the alleged witnesses who left the country and were\r\nnot available for trial; or (3) the substance of the testimony that\r\nthese alleged witnesses would have provided.  There is no\r\nindication here that the period of pretrial delay interfered in any\r\nway with Muoz's ability to present evidence or obtain the\r\ntestimony of witnesses, or that it had any impact on the fairness\r\nof his trial.  See Colombo, 852 F.2d at 25-26. Accordingly, this\r\nparamount interest in no way favors Muoz's claim of constitutional\r\nimpairment.\r\nWe conclude, applying Barker's balancing test, that\r\nMuoz's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated. \r\n                   CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm.\n",

Relying on 18 U.S.C.  3161(h)(1)(H) (which provides that any unreasonable delay resulting from the transfer of a defendant be included in STA calculations and mandating that any such delay in excess of ten days from the date of the order directing transportation and the defendant's arrival at the destination be presumed unreasonable), Munoz argues that the STA clock began to run on November 27, 1995, when he was    ordered removed to Puerto Rico, and that only ten days of the period between the removal order and his January 25, 1996 appearance should be excluded from the STA calculation. The government counters that the STA clock began to run on January 25, 1996, when Munoz first appeared before a judicial officer in Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Munoz's reliance on this  3161(h)(1)(H) to establish a violation of the STA in his case is misplaced. Section 3161(h)(1)(H) is a tolling provision, not one that sets forth the events that trigger the start of the seventy-day period in which a trial must be held. Section 3161(c)(1) clearly states that \"the trial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from the filing date (and making public) of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.\" (emphasis added). Munoz first appeared before a judicial officer of the District of Puerto Rico on January 26, 1995. The delay resulting from the transfer of Munoz from Miami to Puerto Rico (the court in which the charges    were pending) thus took place well before the STA clock even began to run. See United States v. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 1998). As a result, there was no STA violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

VI. This right attaches upon arrest or indictment, whichever occurs first. See United States v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 6-7, 71 L. Ed. 2d 696, 102 S. Ct. 1497 (1982); United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1061 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Colombo, 852 F.2d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 1988).

Section 3173 of the STA states that \"no provision of this chapter shall be interpreted as a bar to any claim of denial of speedy trial as required by amendment VI of the Constitution.\" 18 U.S.C.  3173; see also United States v. Mitchell, 723 F.2d 1040, 1049 (1st Cir. 1983). \"It would be, however, 'an unusual case in which the time limits of the [STA] have been met but the Sixth Amendment right to speedy trial has been violated.'\" Mitchell, 723 F.2d at 1049 (quoting United States v. Nance, 666 F.2d 353, 360 (9th Cir. 1982)). This court reviews a district court's speedy trial determination under the Sixth Amendment for abuse of discretion.

Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530-33, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101, 92 S. Ct. 2182 (1972), the Supreme Court established a four-part balancing test to be used in determining whether a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial has been violated. A court should consider: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right; and (4) the prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay. See Barker,    407 U.S. at 530. \"None of these factors is 'either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial. Rather, they are related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.'\" United States v. Henson, 945 F.2d 430, 437 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 533).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first factor, the length of the delay, was identified by the Supreme Court as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">to some extent a triggering mechanism. Until there is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance. Nevertheless, because of the imprecision of the right to speedy trial, the length of delay that will provoke such an inquiry is necessarily dependent upon the peculiar circumstances of the case. For example, the delay that can be tolerated for an ordinary street crime is less than for a serious, complex conspiracy charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barker, 407 U.S. at 530-31. The Supreme Court has said that \"the lower courts have generally found postaccusation delay 'presumptively prejudicial' at least as it approaches one year.\" Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S.    647, 652 n.1, 120 L. Ed. 2d 520, 112 S. Ct. 2686 (1992) (citations omitted). We shall assume, under the foregoing, that the nineteen month delay in this case was \"presumptively prejudicial\" so as to trigger further inquiry. See, e.g., Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 21 (assuming that a fifteen month delay was presumptively prejudicial so as to trigger further inquiry); Colombo, 852 F.2d at 24 (holding that a twenty-four month delay was long enough to be presumptively prejudicial). Still, we hold that the cumulative effect of the pretrial delay, viewed under all the factors set forth in Barker, falls short of establishing a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once an examination of the Sixth Amendment claim is triggered, the weight given in the analysis to the length of the delay depends upon the extent to which the delay exceeds the bare minimum considered presumptively prejudicial. See Doggett, 505 U.S. at 652. Munoz waited over nineteen months for the commencement of trial in this case, a case more complicated than \"an ordinary street crime\" but less so than \"a serious, complex conspiracy charge.\" Barker, 407 U.S. at 531. Arguably, therefore, the period of the    delay was long enough to tip the scales slightly in favor of Munoz's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second factor, the reasons for the delay, has been called, \"the focal inquiry.\" Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 22 (citation omitted). As with the first factor, \"here, too, different weights should be assigned to different reasons.\" Barker, 407 U.S. at 531. Munoz argues that the chief reason for the delay was the two month period from the time Munoz was ordered removed from the Southern District of Florida until his appearance before a judicial officer in the District of Puerto Rico. Even acknowledging the fact that the government cannot simply buy Munoz a coach ticket on an airline and immediately place him on a flight to San Juan, two months seems to be quite a long time to transport an inmate from South Florida to San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, Munoz ignores the role his many pretrial motions played in causing the nineteen month delay between his indictment and the jury trial. His many motions included: (1) a motion for Luis Plaza to withdraw as attorney, and to extend the time to announce new counsel (3/11/96); (2) a motion to transfer the case to the Southern District of Florida (6/11/96); (3) a motion    requesting the mandatory disqualification or recusal of the trial judge and a change of venue (6/24/96); (4) a motion to compel the government to administer polygraph examinations to witnesses (6/24/96); (5) a pro se motion to dismiss the indictment alleging government misconduct, destruction of exculpatory evidence, and prosecutorial misconduct (7/2/96); (6) a pro se motion to dismiss the indictment alleging government misconduct and seeking to compel the government to disclose a personnel file, information, and supplementary evidence (7/10/96); (7) a pro se motion to dismiss the indictment alleging violation of due process and constitutional rights (7/15/96); (8) a pro se motion for the setting of a hearing (7/15/96); (9) a pro se motion for additional discovery and Jencks Act material (7/26/96); (10) a pro se motion to suppress evidence (7/26/96); (11) a motion for Joseph Laws to withdraw as attorney (7/29/96); and (12) a motion for Joseph Laws to withdraw as attorney (11/15/96).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third factor, the defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right, \"is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.\"    Barker, 407 U.S. at 531-32, 33 L. Ed. 2d 101, 92 S. Ct. 2182. A defendant should give some indication, prior to his assertion of a speedy trial violation, that he wishes to proceed to trial.

Nowhere does he delineate: (1) the alleged prejudice he suffered; (2) the alleged witnesses who left the    country and were not available for trial; or (3) the substance of the testimony that these alleged witnesses would have provided. There is no indication here that the period of pretrial delay interfered in any way with Munoz's ability to present evidence or obtain the testimony of witnesses, or that it had any impact on the fairness of his trial.

On November 15, 1995, a Puerto Rico grand    jury returned a three count indictment against Munoz and Mario Saavedra charging them with violations of various narcotics laws. Munoz was arrested in Miami, Florida on November 17, 1995. Munoz first appeared before the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on November 17, 1995. On November 20, 1995, a detention hearing was held at which the court ordered Munoz held on $ 500,000 bail. A removal hearing was held on November 27, 1995. At the hearing, the court ordered the removal and transportation of Munoz to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. On January 25, 1996, Munoz made his initial appearance before the district court for the District of Puerto Rico. On February 5, 1996, Munoz was arraigned and pled not guilty to all three counts of the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Munoz filed a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial on June 26, 1996. He filed a second motion to dismiss on the same grounds on June 17, 1997. Both motions were denied. On June 19, 1997, a jury trial commenced. On July 1, 1997, Munoz was convicted on all three counts. The district court sentenced Munoz to: (1) 324 months of imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently;    (2) a supervised term of release of five years as to each count, to be served concurrently; and (3) a fine of $ 10,000 as to each count, and a special monetary assessment of $ 100 as to each count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.

The STA provides that the government must bring a criminal defendant to trial no more than seventy days after the later of the filing date of the information or indictment, or the date on which the criminal defendant first appears before a judicial officer of a court in which the charge is pending. See 18 U.S.C.  3161(c)(1). In calculating the seventy days, the STA excludes certain time periods. See 18 U.S.C.  3161(h)(1)-(9); see also Scantleberry-Frank, 158 F.3d at 614. If a criminal indictment is not brought to trial within the time limit imposed by  3161(c)(1), as extended by operation    of  3161(h)(1)-(9), the penalty provisions of the STA mandate that \"the information or indictment shall be dismissed on motion of the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C.  3162(a)(2).

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2182</span></a></span> (1972), the Supreme Court established a four-part balancing test to be used in determining whether a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial has been violated. A court should consider: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right; and (4) the prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay. See Barker,    407 U.S. at 530. \"None of these factors is 'either a necessary or sufficient condition to the finding of a deprivation of the right of speedy trial. Rather, they are related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.'\" United States v. Henson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569089\"><a href=\"/opinion/569089/united-states-v-david-henson-aka-paul-v-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>, 437 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Barker, 407 U.S. at 533).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first factor, the length of the delay, was identified by the Supreme Court as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">to some extent a triggering mechanism. Until there is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance. Nevertheless, because of the imprecision of the right to speedy trial, the length of delay that will provoke such an inquiry is necessarily dependent upon the peculiar circumstances of the case. For example, the delay that can be tolerated for an ordinary street crime is less than for a serious, complex conspiracy charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Barker, 407 U.S. at 530-31. The Supreme Court has said that \"the lower courts have generally found postaccusation delay 'presumptively prejudicial' at least as it approaches one year.\" Doggett v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112780\"><a href=\"/opinion/112780/doggett-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>    <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span>, 652 n.1, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112780\"><a href=\"/opinion/112780/doggett-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

We shall assume, under the foregoing, that the nineteen month delay in this case was \"presumptively prejudicial\" so as to trigger further inquiry. See, e.g., Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 21 (assuming that a fifteen month delay was presumptively prejudicial so as to trigger further inquiry); Colombo, 852 F.2d at 24 (holding that a twenty-four month delay was long enough to be presumptively prejudicial). Still, we hold that the cumulative effect of the pretrial delay, viewed under all the factors set forth in Barker, falls short of establishing a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once an examination of the Sixth Amendment claim is triggered, the weight given in the analysis to the length of the delay depends upon the extent to which the delay exceeds the bare minimum considered presumptively prejudicial. See Doggett, 505 U.S. at 652. Munoz waited over nineteen months for the commencement of trial in this case, a case more complicated than \"an ordinary street crime\" but less so than \"a serious, complex conspiracy charge.\" Barker, 407 U.S. at 531. Arguably, therefore, the period of the    delay was long enough to tip the scales slightly in favor of Munoz's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second factor, the reasons for the delay, has been called, \"the focal inquiry.\" Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 22 (citation omitted). As with the first factor, \"here, too, different weights should be assigned to different reasons.\" Barker, 407 U.S. at 531. Munoz argues that the chief reason for the delay was the two month period from the time Munoz was ordered removed from the Southern District of Florida until his appearance before a judicial officer in the District of Puerto Rico. Even acknowledging the fact that the government cannot simply buy Munoz a coach ticket on an airline and immediately place him on a flight to San Juan, two months seems to be quite a long time to transport an inmate from South Florida to San Juan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, Munoz ignores the role his many pretrial motions played in causing the nineteen month delay between his indictment and the jury trial. His many motions included: (1) a motion for Luis Plaza to withdraw as attorney, and to extend the time to announce new counsel (3/11/96); (2) a motion to transfer the case to the Southern District of Florida (6/11/96); (3) a motion    requesting the mandatory disqualification or recusal of the trial judge and a change of venue (6/24/96); (4) a motion to compel the government to administer polygraph examinations to witnesses (6/24/96); (5) a pro se motion to dismiss the indictment alleging government misconduct, destruction of exculpatory evidence, and prosecutorial misconduct (7/2/96); (6) a pro se motion to dismiss the indictment alleging government misconduct and seeking to compel the government to disclose a personnel file, information, and supplementary evidence (7/10/96); (7) a pro se motion to dismiss the indictment alleging violation of due process and constitutional rights (7/15/96); (8) a pro se motion for the setting of a hearing (7/15/96); (9) a pro se motion for additional discovery and Jencks Act material (7/26/96); (10) a pro se motion to suppress evidence (7/26/96); (11) a motion for Joseph Laws to withdraw as attorney (7/29/96); and (12) a motion for Joseph Laws to withdraw as attorney (11/15/96).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third factor, the defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right, \"is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.\"    Barker, 407 U.S. at 531-32, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2182</span></a></span>. A defendant should give some indication, prior to his assertion of a speedy trial violation, that he wishes to proceed to trial. See Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant filed two motions to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. The first was filed on June 26, 1996, and the second was filed at the eleventh hour before trial on June 17, 1997. In between the two motions, as the above catalogue of actions illustrates, Munoz demonstrated a \"lack of enthusiasm for the speedy trial right which he now asserts.\" Henson, 945 F.2d at 438 (1st Cir. 1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth factor -- the prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay -- \"should be assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect. The Court has identified three such interests: (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\" Barker, 407 U.S. at 532 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Barker Court went on to discuss the disadvantages    of lengthy pretrial incarceration for the accused who cannot obtain his release. See Barker, 407 U.S. at 532-33. However, the nineteen months of pretrial incarceration in this case, by itself, is insufficient to establish a constitutional level of prejudice. Cf. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 23 (stating that \"fifteen months of pretrial incarceration was insufficient to establish a constitutional level of prejudice\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Munoz does not allege any anxiety or concern resulting from his pretrial delay so we immediately turn to the third and final factor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Among the three interests safeguarded by the right to speedy trial as guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment, 'the most serious is [protection against impairment of the defense] because the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.'\" Barker, 407 U.S. at 532 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Munoz claims in a conclusory fashion that he \"suffered prejudice while incarcerated. In the interim . . . witnesses left the country and were not available for trial.\" Appellant's Br. at 19. Nowhere does he delineate: (1) the alleged prejudice he suffered; (2) the alleged witnesses who left the    country and were not available for trial; or (3) the substance of the testimony that these alleged witnesses would have provided. There is no indication here that the period of pretrial delay interfered in any way with Munoz's ability to present evidence or obtain the testimony of witnesses, or that it had any impact on the fairness of his trial. See Colombo, 852 F.2d at 25-26. Accordingly, this paramount interest in no way favors Munoz's claim of constitutional impairment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, applying Barker's balancing test, that Munoz's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
