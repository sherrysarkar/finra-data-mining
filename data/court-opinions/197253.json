This  appeal concerns  the\r                                             \r\n\nscope of insurance coverage  for the loss at sea of 19 containers\r\n\nen route from Puerto Rico  to Miami.1  The disputing parties  are\r\n\nthe  two insurance companies  that maintained  insurance policies\r\n\ncovering  the   shipper,  Sea  Barge,   and  the   cargo-handling\r\n\nstevedore, Ayala.   Fireman's  Fund, which provided  an insurance\r\n\npolicy  to  Sea Barge,  defended Sea  Barge  and Ayala  in multi-\r\n\ndistrict litigation resulting  from the loss, and then  sought to\r\n\ncompel AIICO, Ayala's insurer, to reimburse it for settlement and\r\n\nlitigation costs.   The district court found  that AIICO's policy\r\n\ndid  not  cover the  type of  risk at  issue here,  and therefore\r\n\ngranted  summary  judgment  for  AIICO.   Although  our  analysis\r\n\ndiffers  in  some details  from that  of  the district  court, we\r\n\napprove its general approach and ruling, and therefore affirm.\r\n\n                              FACTS\r                                             \r\n\n     In 1985, three companies, Ayala, Maduro, and Zapata, joined\r\n\ntogether to form a barge service named Sea Barge, to operate\r\n\nbetween Puerto Rico and Miami.  Ayala and Maduro were stevedores:\r\n\nAyala's operations were in Puerto Rico; Maduro's were in Miami.\r\n\nZapata provided tug and barge services.  Pursuant to the\r\n\nShareholders' Agreement, Ayala, Maduro and Zapata agreed to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1    As the full names of the relevant entities in this case\r\nare  somewhat unwieldy, each will be referred to by the following\r\nabbreviations:   Fireman's  Fund Insurance  Companies (\"Fireman's\r\nFund\"); American  International Insurance Company of Puerto Rico,\r\nInc.  (\"AIICO\"); Marine Transportation  Services Sea Barge Group,\r\nInc. (\"Sea Barge\"); Luis Ayala Colon &amp; Sucesores, Inc. (\"Ayala\");\r\nZapata  Gulf Marine  Corporation  (\"Zapata\"); and  S.E.L.  Maduro\r\n(Florida), Inc. (\"Maduro\"). \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\ncooperate in assisting Sea Barge to obtain cargo and cargo legal\r\n\nliability insurance, as well as container and chassis damage\r\n\ninsurance.  They further agreed that each policy would name all\r\n\nparties as additional insureds as well as Sea Barge.  Ayala and\r\n\nMaduro also agreed to obtain liability insurance covering\r\n\nstevedoring services provided to Sea Barge.  \r\n\n     Under a separate Stevedoring Agreement executed between Sea\r\n\nBarge and Ayala, Ayala agreed to maintain public liability and\r\n\nproperty damage insurance covering Ayala's liability for bodily\r\n\ninjury and property damage sustained by third parties arising out\r\n\nof its stevedoring operations.\r\n\n     In October 1987, AIICO issued a comprehensive general\r\n\nliability policy (the \"MultiPeril Policy\") to Ayala, covering\r\n\npersonal injury and property damage.  A separate policy covered\r\n\nwarehousing and stevedoring.  In July 1988, Fireman's Fund issued\r\n\na Marine Policy package to Sea Barge; this included a legal\r\n\nliability policy, covering Sea Barge's legal liability for\r\n\nphysical loss or damage to goods and/or merchandise.2  \r\n\n     On December 16, 1988, Sea Barge's Barge 101 set off on its\r\n\nill-fated journey.  It encountered rough weather at sea, and 19\r\n\ncontainers were lost.  Seven lawsuits were filed by cargo\r\n\nclaimants; of these, all named Sea Barge as defendant, but only\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2    The Fireman's  Fund policy identified Sea  Barge as the\r\nnamed  assured,  and  Ayala,  Zapata, and  Maduro  as  additional\r\ninsureds  \"solely with  respect  to their  activities\" under  the\r\nShareholders Agreement.  The policy also  stated that it excluded\r\ncoverage  for damages  collectible  under  the Assured's  General\r\nLiability Policy  and/or recovery under any  other primary policy\r\nof the assured.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\none also named Ayala as a defendant.3  Fireman's Fund, which\r\n\ndefended Sea Barge and Ayala in the ensuing multi-district\r\n\nlitigation, subsequently sought contribution and indemnity from\r\n\nAIICO.4  AIICO refused, contending the loss was not covered by\r\n\nits policy because the incident occurred during Sea Barge's\r\n\nsegment of the transportation endeavor, rather than during\r\n\nAyala's.  The district court granted summary judgment for AIICO,\r\n\nconcluding, largely on the basis of two exclusions contained in\r\n\nthe AIICO policy (the watercraft exclusion and the policy\r\n\nterritory exclusion), that the loss which occurred was not the\r\n\ntype insured against by the AIICO policy.  It therefore did not\r\n\nreach the second issue raised by the parties as to which of the\r\n\ntwo policies was primary.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n     Our review of the district court's grant of summary\r\n\njudgement in AIICO's favor is de novo.

Since the\r                    \r\n\nconstruction of an insurance policy is a question of law, we must\r\n\nmake our own independent examination of the policy.  Nieves v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nIntercontinental Life Ins. Co. of Puerto Rico, 964 F.2d 60, 63\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).   \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3    The  cases, five of which were filed in Florida and two\r\nof  which  were  filed  in  Puerto  Rico,  were  consolidated and\r\ntransferred to the District of Puerto Rico.\r\n\n     4    Fireman's   Fund   had  previously   requested  AIICO's\r\nparticipation in  the defense during  the pre-trial phase  of the\r\nmulti-district litigation; however, this request was rejected  by\r\nAIICO.  \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n     Our analysis of the issue is potentially two-pronged: we\r\n\nconsider first whether the loss was the type covered by or\r\n\ncontemplated by the policies in question; and if so, we must\r\n\ndetermine which policy is primary.  See Couch on Insurance 2d,\r                                                                       \r\n\nsec. 62: 44, 45 (Rev. ed. 1983).  \r\n\n     In addressing the first question, we turn to the language of\r\n\nthe policy, supplementing this if necessary with evidence of the\r\n\nparties' intent, as demonstrated here in the Shareholders\r\n\nAgreement, the Stevedoring Agreement, and the various affidavits\r\n\nsubmitted.  See Nieves, 964 F.2d at 63 (if wording of contract is\r                                \r\n\nexplicit and language is clear, terms and conditions are binding\r\n\non parties); U.S. Aviation v. Fitchburg-Leominster Flying Club,\r                                                                        \r\n\n42 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir. 1994) (determination of ambiguity of\r\n\npolicy terms and resolution thereof are matters for the court).  \r\n\n     The AIICO policy, as noted above, was a comprehensive\r\n\ngeneral liability policy.  This policy contained a number of\r\n\nrelevant exclusions and endorsements modifying the policy.  For\r\n\nthe reasons we discuss below, these in the aggregate indicate\r\n\nthat the loss sustained here was not the type the AIICO policy\r\n\nwas intended to cover.  However, while the district court based\r\n\nits grant of summary judgment largely on the watercraft and\r\n\npolicy territory exclusions, we find several other terms in the\r\n\nAIICO policy more compelling, specifically those covering the\r\n\ndefinition of the \"named insured\" and \"additional insured.\"    We\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nfirst discuss briefly the grounds relied on by the district\r\n\ncourt.5  \r\n\n   The watercraft exclusion, contained in Section II of the\r\n\nGeneral Liability Insurance Coverage, provided:\r\n\n          This insurance does not apply: [...] \r\n                    (e)  to bodily injury or property\r\n          damage arising out of the ownership,\r\n          maintenance, operation, use, loading or\r\n          unloading of\r\n                         (1)  any watercraft owned or\r\n          operated by or rented or loaned to any\r\n          insured, or\r\n                         (2)  any other watercraft\r\n          operated by any person in the course of his\r\n          employment by any insured;\r\n                    but this exclusion does not apply\r\n          to watercraft while ashore on premises owned\r\n          by, rented to or controlled by the named\r\n          insured.\r\n\nFireman's Fund maintains that reading this provision to exclude\r\n\ncoverage for Ayala's activities as a stevedore would render the\r\n\ninsurance policy meaningless, as Ayala's activities were\r\n\nnecessarily tied to loading and unloading Sea Barge vessels.  \r\n\n     But reading this as effectively excluding stevedoring\r\n\nactivities would not seem to us to contradict the general intent\r\n\nof the parties and Ayala's expressed intent not to duplicate\r\n\ninsurance costs, for, as we have noted, AIICO issued a separate\r\n\npolicy to Ayala covering warehousing and stevedoring.  This fact\r\n\nalso seems to distinguish this case from Price v. Zim Israel\r                                                                      \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5    In  our analysis, we are  mindful that the  terms in an\r\ninsurance  contract are to be given their plain meaning.  Wickman\r                                                                           \r\nv. Northwestern Nat'l  Ins. Co.,  908 F.2d 1077,  1084 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \r\n1990).\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nNavigation Co., 616 F.2d 422 (9th Cir. 1980),6 principally relied\r                        \r\n\non by appellant, for in Price applying the exclusion would have\r                                       \r\n\nresulted in avoidance of an obligation which the insurer had\r\n\nagreed to assume.7  In any event, we feel more comfortable\r\n\nrelying on other grounds for our disposition.   \r\n\n     We next turn to a second exclusion which the district court\r\n\nemphasized in its decision -- the Policy Territory Exclusion. \r\n\nThe applicable section of the Policy Territory Exclusion states:\r\n\n          \"policy territory\" means:\r\n          a.    the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or\r\n          b.    international waters or air space,\r\n          provided the bodily injury or property damage\r\n          does not occur in the course of travel or\r\n          transportation to or from any other country,\r                                                                \r\n          state or nation.... (emphasis added).\r                                   \r\n\n     AIICO makes much in its brief of the use of the term\r\n\n\"state,\" contending that the intended meaning includes other\r\n\nstates within the United States, rather than only contemplating\r\n\nforeign states.  Again, we find this argument less than\r\n\nconvincing.  Black's Law Dictionary defines \"state\" as \"either\r\n\n... body politic of a nation ... or ... an individual\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6     In  Price, the  Ninth Circuit  held that  a watercraft\r                              \r\nexclusion similar  to this one in a  policy issued to a stevedore\r\ndid   not  preclude   coverage  for   injuries  sustained   by  a\r\nlongshoreman  employed  by the  stevedore  while  working on  the\r\ntransport  company's vessel.  Price v. Zim Israel Navigation Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n616 F.2d 422, 427 (9th Cir. 1980).  The Price court reasoned that\r                                                       \r\nconstruing  the watercraft  exclusion  to preclude  coverage  for\r\nactivities on the vessel would deny coverage to the stevedore and\r\nthe cargo transport company,  in violation of the purpose  of the\r\nendorsement, which was to provide coverage for such operations to\r\nboth companies.  Id. \r                              \r\n\n     7    Additionally,   Price  is   inapposite   here,  as   an\r                                         \r\nendorsement to  this  policy specifically  distinguishes  between\r\nvessels above and under 26 feet in length.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ngovernmental unit of such nation.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 1407\r                                                                    \r\n\n(6th ed. 1990).  To interpret the policy exclusion to exclude\r\n\ncoverage for accidents that occur between Florida and Puerto Rico\r\n\nas \"states\" creates a result that is perplexing at best, given\r\n\nthe enterprise at hand.  The district court's rationale was that\r\n\ncoverage for incidents occurring in international waters was not\r\n\nintended at all under the AIICO policy, but rather that the\r\n\nendorsement was intended to restrict coverage to Puerto Rico\r\n\nitself, on the ground that coverage for the voyage and Florida\r\n\nportions was intended to be obtained by the companies actually\r\n\nengaged in each of those legs of the transportation operation,\r\n\ni.e., Sea Barge and Maduro, respectively.  As with the watercraft\r              \r\n\nexclusion, we prefer not to rest our decision on this ground. \r\n\n     We therefore turn to the policy terms we do see as clearly\r\n\nindicating that the loss that occurred here was not contemplated\r\n\nunder the AIICO policy, specifically Endorsements 1 and 13.\r\n\n     Endorsement 1 of the AIICO policy, \"Named Insured,\" provides\r\n\nthat the named insured under the policy is Ayala \"and/or any\r\n\nsubsidiary, associated, affiliated, newly acquired, or controlled\r\n\ncorporation and/or company as may now be constituted or hereafter\r\n\nformed, and over which the named insured maintains ownership or\r\n\nmajority interest.\"  Fireman's Fund maintains that Sea Barge\r\n\nfalls within the category of companies covered due to Ayala's\r\n\n\"ownership interest\" in Sea Barge.  However, the facts do not\r\n\nsupport this assertion:  Ayala owned only 20% of the outstanding\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nshares of Sea Barge stock, which can be seen as neither ownership\r\n\nnor a majority interest.\r\n\n     Endorsement 13 of the AIICO policy, \"Additional Insured,\"\r\n\nlends additional credence to the view that the occurrence in\r\n\nquestion was not intended to be covered by the policy.  This\r\n\nendorsement states that: \r\n\n          the unqualified word 'insured' also includes\r\n          the below mentioned entities, but only with\r\n          respect to their liability arising out of\r\n          operations performed by the named insured. \r\n          Such coverage as is afforded under this\r\n          clause shall only apply when contract\r\n          conditions between the named insured and\r\n          their principals so stipulate and then only\r\n          insofar as is necessary to meet the\r\n          requirements of such contract conditions. \r\n\nThe list following this statement includes Sea Barge, as well as\r\n\nnine other companies.  It strains credulity to suggest that\r\n\nAyala, or AIICO, intended all ten companies listed (including Sea\r\n\nBarge) to thereby gain unlimited coverage under the policy;\r\n\nrather, coverage is specifically limited to that required by\r\n\ncontracts between those listed and Ayala.  While Fireman's Fund\r\n\nmaintains that the contract in question between Ayala and Sea\r\n\nBarge must be the Shareholders' Agreement, we conclude that the\r\n\ncontracts the endorsement anticipates are discrete contracts\r\n\nbetween Ayala and the listed companies.  Therefore, here the\r\n\nrelevant contract must be the stevedoring contract between Ayala\r\n\nand Sea Barge.  To read the endorsement otherwise overlooks both\r\n\nlogic and the language of the endorsement.  \r\n\n     Our conclusion that straightforward construction of the\r\n\npolicy's terms indicates that the loss that occurred was not\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ncontemplated as a covered one is further buttressed by our\r\n\nexamination of the parties' intent, as evidenced by key documents\r\n\nand by sworn testimony.  See In re San Juan DuPont Plaza Hotel\r                                                                        \r\n\nFire Litig., 802 F.Supp. 624, 637 (D.P.R. 1992), aff'd, 989 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n26 (1st Cir. 1993) (terms of policy must be interpreted according\r\n\nto parties' purpose and intent).  \r\n\n     As noted above, the two major documents in this case are the\r\n\noriginal Shareholders' Agreement, and the stevedoring contract\r\n\nbetween Sea Barge and Ayala.  The Shareholders' Agreement creates\r\n\nan interlocking structure of responsibility for the three forming\r\n\ncompanies, with the duties of each clearly specified.  In\r\n\ngeneral, these duties are distinct -- Ayala was to handle Puerto\r\n\nRico-based stevedoring activities, Zapata those relating to the\r\n\ntugs and barges, and Maduro the Florida-based activities. \r\n\nArticle II, section 2.02(vi) of the Agreement stipulates that all\r\n\nparties shall cooperate with Sea Barge in obtaining cargo and\r\n\ncargo legal liability insurance, and that each policy will name\r\n\nall parties, in addition to Sea Barge, as additional insureds.8  \r\n\n     Both Lemuel Toledo Campos, the insurance broker who advised\r\n\nAyala, and Hernan F. Ayala-Parsi, the executive vice president of\r\n\nAyala, stated in their affidavits that the intent of the\r\n\ninsurance provisions in the Shareholders' Agreement was to avoid\r\n\nduplication of insurance costs by preventing any concurrent\r\n\ncoverage.  Ayala-Parsi also stated that the parties' intent in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8    Ayala and Maduro were  required under section 2.02(vii)\r\nto obtain separate liability insurance covering their stevedoring\r\nactivities as provided to Sea Barge.\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nthe Agreement was that losses at sea were to be covered by Sea\r\n\nBarge's insurance, and that the AIICO policy's terms were\r\n\nconsistent with this intent.  \r\n\n     The Stevedoring Agreement, the other major document here, is\r\n\nnarrowly directed at structuring the stevedoring relationship\r\n\nbetween Sea Barge and Ayala.  Insofar as it addresses insurance\r\n\ncoverage, it provides that Ayala will maintain worker's\r\n\ncompensation insurance, as well as public liability insurance and\r\n\nproperty damage insurance \"arising out of operations performed\r\n\nhereto.\"  It further contains a limitation of liability clause\r\n\nproviding that Sea Barge shall indemnify and hold harmless Ayala\r\n\nfor any losses due to unseaworthiness or negligence of Sea Barge\r\n\nemployees, and limiting Ayala's liability to losses caused by its\r\n\nown negligence, and then only as a stevedore and not as a\r\n\nbailee.9  The Agreement therefore appears to create a\r\n\nrelationship between Ayala and Sea Barge under which Ayala's\r\n\nresponsibilities to maintain insurance and its liability are\r\n\nnarrowly circumscribed. \r\n\n     Indeed, it is apparent from the testimony presented that\r\n\nAIICO and Ayala, the parties to the insurance policy in question,\r\n\nunderstood and intended that the AIICO policy would not extend to\r\n\nSea Barge's activities other than in the limited circumstances\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9    Additionally, Article XIV of the Stevedoring Agreement,\r\nthe Custody Clause, provides that Sea  Barge would be responsible\r\nfor goods from the time they  were received by it at the terminal\r\nfacilities  at the port of  loading until they  were delivered or\r\ndispatched from the port of unloading.  \r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nset forth in the Stevedoring Agreement.10  Toledo Campos stated\r\n\nthat the scope of Endorsement 1 of the AIICO policy was intended\r\n\nto include only those companies Ayala fully owned or held a\r\n\nmajority interest in, and that the coverage of Sea Barge and the\r\n\nother companies listed in Endorsement 13 was limited to that\r\n\nrequired by contracts between the listed parties and Ayala. \r\n\nUlises Seijo, a general adjuster for AIICO, confirmed in his\r\n\naffidavit that Endorsement 1 applies only to those companies\r\n\nwhich Ayala owned or had a majority interest in, and he\r\n\nspecifically stated, \"It [the endorsement] does not apply to Sea\r\n\nBarge.\"  \r\n\n     Having reached the conclusion that the loss which occurred\r\n\nwas not of the type covered or intended to be covered by the\r\n\nAIICO policy, we do not reach the second prong of the analysis\r\n\nnoted above as to which policy is primary, and may draw our\r\n\nefforts to a close at this point.  We therefore affirm the\r\n\ndistrict court.\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n     As the loss at sea of the nineteen containers was not within\r\n\nthe purview of the coverage provided by the AIICO policy, we\r\n\nconclude that the district court correctly granted summary\r\n\njudgment for AIICO.  \r\n\nAffirmed. \r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     10   No  testimony to the  contrary has been  brought to our\r\nattention.  \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n",

Fireman's Fund, which provided an insurance policy to Sea Barge, defended Sea Barge and Ayala in multi-district litigation resulting from the loss, and then sought to compel AIICO, Ayala's insurer, to reimburse it for settlement and litigation costs.  The district court found that AIICO's policy did not cover the type of risk at issue here, and therefore granted summary judgment for AIICO.  Although our analysis differs in some details from that of the district court, we approve its general approach and ruling, and therefore affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, three companies, Ayala, Maduro, and Zapata, joined together to form a barge service named Sea Barge, to operate between Puerto Rico and Miami.  Ayala and Maduro were stevedores:  Ayala's operations were in Puerto Rico;  Maduro's were in Miami.  Zapata provided tug and barge services.  Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, Ayala, Maduro and Zapata agreed to cooperate in assisting Sea Barge to obtain cargo and cargo legal liability insurance, as well as container and chassis damage insurance.  They further agreed that each policy would name all parties as additional insureds as well as Sea Barge.  Ayala and Maduro also agreed to obtain liability insurance covering stevedoring services provided to Sea Barge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under a separate Stevedoring Agreement executed between Sea Barge and Ayala, Ayala agreed to maintain public liability and property damage insurance covering Ayala's liability for bodily injury and property damage sustained by third parties arising out of its stevedoring operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1987, AIICO issued a comprehensive general liability policy (the \"MultiPeril Policy\") to Ayala, covering personal injury and property damage.  A separate policy covered warehousing and stevedoring.  In July 1988, Fireman's Fund issued a Marine Policy package to Sea Barge;  this included a legal liability policy, covering Sea Barge's legal liability for physical loss or damage to goods and/or merchandise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, 1988, Sea Barge's Barge 101 set off on its ill-fated journey.  It encountered rough weather at sea, and 19 containers were lost.  Seven lawsuits were filed by cargo claimants;  of these, all named Sea Barge as defendant, but only one also named Ayala as a defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Fireman's Fund, which defended Sea Barge and Ayala in the ensuing multi-district litigation, subsequently sought contribution and indemnity from AIICO.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  AIICO refused, contending the loss was not covered by its policy because the incident occurred during Sea Barge's segment of the transportation endeavor, rather than during Ayala's.  The district court granted summary judgment for AIICO, concluding, largely on the basis of two exclusions contained in the AIICO policy (the watercraft exclusion and the policy territory exclusion), that the loss which occurred was not the type insured against by the AIICO policy.  It therefore did not reach the second issue raised by the parties as to which of the two policies was primary.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgement in AIICO's favor is de novo.  Velez-Gomez v. SMA Life Assur. Co., 8 F.3d 873, 875 (1st Cir.1993).  Since the construction of an insurance policy is a question of law, we must make our own independent examination of the policy.  Nieves v. Intercontinental Life Ins. Co. of Puerto Rico, 964 F.2d 60, 63 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of the issue is potentially two-pronged:  we consider first whether the loss was the type covered by or contemplated by the policies in question;  and if so, we must determine which policy is primary.  See Couch on Insurance 2d, sec. 62:  44, 45 (Rev. ed.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the first question, we turn to the language of the policy, supplementing this if necessary with evidence of the parties' intent, as demonstrated here in the Shareholders Agreement, the Stevedoring Agreement, and the various affidavits submitted.  See Nieves, 964 F.2d at 63 (if wording of contract is explicit and language is clear, terms and conditions are binding on parties);  U.S. Aviation v. Fitchburg-Leominster Flying Club, 42 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir.1994) (determination of ambiguity of policy terms and resolution thereof are matters for the court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AIICO policy, as noted above, was a comprehensive general liability policy.  This policy contained a number of relevant exclusions and endorsements modifying the policy.  For the reasons we discuss below, these in the aggregate indicate that the loss sustained here was not the type the AIICO policy was intended to cover.  However, while the district court based its grant of summary judgment largely on the watercraft and policy territory exclusions, we find several other terms in the AIICO policy more compelling, specifically those covering the definition of the \"named insured\" and \"additional insured.\"   We first discuss briefly the grounds relied on by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The watercraft exclusion, contained in Section II of the General Liability Insurance Coverage, provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>This insurance does not apply:  [ ... ]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) any watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) any other watercraft operated by any person in the course of his employment by any insured;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">but this exclusion does not apply to watercraft while ashore on premises owned by, rented to or controlled by the named insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fireman's Fund maintains that reading this provision to exclude coverage for Ayala's activities as a stevedore would render the insurance policy meaningless, as Ayala's activities were necessarily tied to loading and unloading Sea Barge vessels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But reading this as effectively excluding stevedoring activities would not seem to us to contradict the general intent of the parties and Ayala's expressed intent not to duplicate insurance costs, for, as we have noted, AIICO issued a separate policy to Ayala covering warehousing and stevedoring.  This fact also seems to distinguish this case from Price v. Zim Israel Navigation Co., 616 F.2d 422 (9th Cir.1980),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> principally relied on by appellant, for in Price applying the exclusion would have resulted in avoidance of an obligation which the insurer had agreed to assume.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In any event, we feel more comfortable relying on other grounds for our disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to a second exclusion which the district court emphasized in its decision--the Policy Territory Exclusion.  The applicable section of the Policy Territory Exclusion states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>\"policy territory\" means:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>a. the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>b. international waters or air space, provided the bodily injury or property damage does not occur in the course of travel or transportation to or from any other country, state or nation. ... (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AIICO makes much in its brief of the use of the term \"state,\" contending that the intended meaning includes other states within the United States, rather than only contemplating foreign states.  Again, we find this argument less than convincing.  Black's Law Dictionary defines \"state\" as \"either ... body politic of a nation ... or ... an individual governmental unit of such nation.\"   Black's Law Dictionary 1407 (6th ed.1990).  To interpret the policy exclusion to exclude coverage for accidents that occur between Florida and Puerto Rico as \"states\" creates a result that is perplexing at best, given the enterprise at hand.  The district court's rationale was that coverage for incidents occurring in international waters was not intended at all under the AIICO policy, but rather that the endorsement was intended to restrict coverage to Puerto Rico itself, on the ground that coverage for the voyage and Florida portions was intended to be obtained by the companies actually engaged in each of those legs of the transportation operation, i.e., Sea Barge and Maduro, respectively.  As with the watercraft exclusion, we prefer not to rest our decision on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore turn to the policy terms we do see as clearly indicating that the loss that occurred here was not contemplated under the AIICO policy, specifically Endorsements 1 and 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Endorsement 1 of the AIICO policy, \"Named Insured,\" provides that the named insured under the policy is Ayala \"and/or any subsidiary, associated, affiliated, newly acquired, or controlled corporation and/or company as may now be constituted or hereafter formed, and over which the named insured maintains ownership or majority interest.\"   Fireman's Fund maintains that Sea Barge falls within the category of companies covered due to Ayala's \"ownership interest\" in Sea Barge.  However, the facts do not support this assertion:  Ayala owned only 20% of the outstanding shares of Sea Barge stock, which can be seen as neither ownership nor a majority interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Endorsement 13 of the AIICO policy, \"Additional Insured,\" lends additional credence to the view that the occurrence in question was not intended to be covered by the policy.  This endorsement states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>the unqualified word 'insured' also includes the below mentioned entities, but only with respect to their liability arising out of operations performed by the named insured.  Such coverage as is afforded under this clause shall only apply when contract conditions between the named insured and their principals so stipulate and then only insofar as is necessary to meet the requirements of such contract conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The list following this statement includes Sea Barge, as well as nine other companies.  It strains credulity to suggest that Ayala, or AIICO, intended all ten companies listed (including Sea Barge) to thereby gain unlimited coverage under the policy;  rather, coverage is specifically limited to that required by contracts between those listed and Ayala.  While Fireman's Fund maintains that the contract in question between Ayala and Sea Barge must be the Shareholders' Agreement, we conclude that the contracts the endorsement anticipates are discrete contracts between Ayala and the listed companies.  Therefore, here the relevant contract must be the stevedoring contract between Ayala and Sea Barge.  To read the endorsement otherwise overlooks both logic and the language of the endorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that straightforward construction of the policy's terms indicates that the loss that occurred was not contemplated as a covered one is further buttressed by our examination of the parties' intent, as evidenced by key documents and by sworn testimony.  See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 802 F.Supp. 624, 637 (D.P.R.1992), aff'd, 989 F.2d 36 (1st Cir.1993) (terms of policy must be interpreted according to parties' purpose and intent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the two major documents in this case are the original Shareholders' Agreement, and the stevedoring contract between Sea Barge and Ayala.  The Shareholders' Agreement creates an interlocking structure of responsibility for the three forming companies, with the duties of each clearly specified.  In general, these duties are distinct--Ayala was to handle Puerto Rico-based stevedoring activities, Zapata those relating to the tugs and barges, and Maduro the Florida-based activities.  Article II, section 2.02(vi) of the Agreement stipulates that all parties shall cooperate with Sea Barge in obtaining cargo and cargo legal liability insurance, and that each policy will name all parties, in addition to Sea Barge, as additional insureds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Lemuel Toledo Campos, the insurance broker who advised Ayala, and Hernan F. Ayala-Parsi, the executive vice president of Ayala, stated in their affidavits that the intent of the insurance provisions in the Shareholders' Agreement was to avoid duplication of insurance costs by preventing any concurrent coverage.  Ayala-Parsi also stated that the parties' intent in the Agreement was that losses at sea were to be covered by Sea Barge's insurance, and that the AIICO policy's terms were consistent with this intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Stevedoring Agreement, the other major document here, is narrowly directed at structuring the stevedoring relationship between Sea Barge and Ayala.  Insofar as it addresses insurance coverage, it provides that Ayala will maintain worker's compensation insurance, as well as public liability insurance and property damage insurance \"arising out of operations performed hereto.\"   It further contains a limitation of liability clause providing that Sea Barge shall indemnify and hold harmless Ayala for any losses due to unseaworthiness or negligence of Sea Barge employees, and limiting Ayala's liability to losses caused by its own negligence, and then only as a stevedore and not as a bailee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The Agreement therefore appears to create a relationship between Ayala and Sea Barge under which Ayala's responsibilities to maintain insurance and its liability are narrowly circumscribed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, it is apparent from the testimony presented that AIICO and Ayala, the parties to the insurance policy in question, understood and intended that the AIICO policy would not extend to Sea Barge's activities other than in the limited circumstances set forth in the Stevedoring Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Toledo Campos stated that the scope of Endorsement 1 of the AIICO policy was intended to include only those companies Ayala fully owned or held a majority interest in, and that the coverage of Sea Barge and the other companies listed in Endorsement 13 was limited to that required by contracts between the listed parties and Ayala.

Fireman's Fund, which provided an insurance policy to Sea Barge, defended Sea Barge and Ayala in multi-district litigation resulting from the loss, and then sought to compel AIICO, Ayala's insurer, to reimburse it for settlement and litigation costs.  The district court found that AIICO's policy did not cover the type of risk at issue here, and therefore granted summary judgment for AIICO.  Although our analysis differs in some details from that of the district court, we approve its general approach and ruling, and therefore affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, three companies, Ayala, Maduro, and Zapata, joined together to form a barge service named Sea Barge, to operate between Puerto Rico and Miami.  Ayala and Maduro were stevedores:  Ayala's operations were in Puerto Rico;  Maduro's were in Miami.  Zapata provided tug and barge services.  Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, Ayala, Maduro and Zapata agreed to cooperate in assisting Sea Barge to obtain cargo and cargo legal liability insurance, as well as container and chassis damage insurance.  They further agreed that each policy would name all parties as additional insureds as well as Sea Barge.  Ayala and Maduro also agreed to obtain liability insurance covering stevedoring services provided to Sea Barge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under a separate Stevedoring Agreement executed between Sea Barge and Ayala, Ayala agreed to maintain public liability and property damage insurance covering Ayala's liability for bodily injury and property damage sustained by third parties arising out of its stevedoring operations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1987, AIICO issued a comprehensive general liability policy (the \"MultiPeril Policy\") to Ayala, covering personal injury and property damage.  A separate policy covered warehousing and stevedoring.  In July 1988, Fireman's Fund issued a Marine Policy package to Sea Barge;  this included a legal liability policy, covering Sea Barge's legal liability for physical loss or damage to goods and/or merchandise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 16, 1988, Sea Barge's Barge 101 set off on its ill-fated journey.  It encountered rough weather at sea, and 19 containers were lost.  Seven lawsuits were filed by cargo claimants;  of these, all named Sea Barge as defendant, but only one also named Ayala as a defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Fireman's Fund, which defended Sea Barge and Ayala in the ensuing multi-district litigation, subsequently sought contribution and indemnity from AIICO.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  AIICO refused, contending the loss was not covered by its policy because the incident occurred during Sea Barge's segment of the transportation endeavor, rather than during Ayala's.  The district court granted summary judgment for AIICO, concluding, largely on the basis of two exclusions contained in the AIICO policy (the watercraft exclusion and the policy territory exclusion), that the loss which occurred was not the type insured against by the AIICO policy.  It therefore did not reach the second issue raised by the parties as to which of the two policies was primary.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's grant of summary judgement in AIICO's favor is de novo.

Since the construction of an insurance policy is a question of law, we must make our own independent examination of the policy.  Nieves v. Intercontinental Life Ins. Co. of Puerto Rico, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583577\"><a href=\"/opinion/583577/rebecca-r-nieves-individually-and-as-next-friend-of-andrew-j-nieves-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">964</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span>, 63 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of the issue is potentially two-pronged:  we consider first whether the loss was the type covered by or contemplated by the policies in question;  and if so, we must determine which policy is primary.  See Couch on Insurance 2d, sec. 62:  44, 45 (Rev. ed.1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the first question, we turn to the language of the policy, supplementing this if necessary with evidence of the parties' intent, as demonstrated here in the Shareholders Agreement, the Stevedoring Agreement, and the various affidavits submitted.  See Nieves, 964 F.2d at 63 (if wording of contract is explicit and language is clear, terms and conditions are binding on parties);  U.S. Aviation v. Fitchburg-Leominster Flying Club, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195791\"><a href=\"/opinion/195791/us-aviation-v-fitchburg-leominster/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.1994) (determination of ambiguity of policy terms and resolution thereof are matters for the court).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AIICO policy, as noted above, was a comprehensive general liability policy.  This policy contained a number of relevant exclusions and endorsements modifying the policy.  For the reasons we discuss below, these in the aggregate indicate that the loss sustained here was not the type the AIICO policy was intended to cover.  However, while the district court based its grant of summary judgment largely on the watercraft and policy territory exclusions, we find several other terms in the AIICO policy more compelling, specifically those covering the definition of the \"named insured\" and \"additional insured.\"   We first discuss briefly the grounds relied on by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The watercraft exclusion, contained in Section II of the General Liability Insurance Coverage, provided:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>This insurance does not apply:  [ ... ]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e) to bodily injury or property damage arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation, use, loading or unloading of</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) any watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) any other watercraft operated by any person in the course of his employment by any insured;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">but this exclusion does not apply to watercraft while ashore on premises owned by, rented to or controlled by the named insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fireman's Fund maintains that reading this provision to exclude coverage for Ayala's activities as a stevedore would render the insurance policy meaningless, as Ayala's activities were necessarily tied to loading and unloading Sea Barge vessels.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But reading this as effectively excluding stevedoring activities would not seem to us to contradict the general intent of the parties and Ayala's expressed intent not to duplicate insurance costs, for, as we have noted, AIICO issued a separate policy to Ayala covering warehousing and stevedoring.  This fact also seems to distinguish this case from Price v. Zim Israel Navigation Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"375417\"><a href=\"/opinion/375417/tyrone-price-v-zim-israel-navigation-co-ltd-a-corporation-zim-israel/\"><span class=\"volume\">616</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1980),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> principally relied on by appellant, for in Price applying the exclusion would have resulted in avoidance of an obligation which the insurer had agreed to assume.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  In any event, we feel more comfortable relying on other grounds for our disposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to a second exclusion which the district court emphasized in its decision--the Policy Territory Exclusion.  The applicable section of the Policy Territory Exclusion states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>\"policy territory\" means:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>a. the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>b. international waters or air space, provided the bodily injury or property damage does not occur in the course of travel or transportation to or from any other country, state or nation. ... (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AIICO makes much in its brief of the use of the term \"state,\" contending that the intended meaning includes other states within the United States, rather than only contemplating foreign states.  Again, we find this argument less than convincing.  Black's Law Dictionary defines \"state\" as \"either ... body politic of a nation ... or ... an individual governmental unit of such nation.\"   Black's Law Dictionary 1407 (6th ed.1990).  To interpret the policy exclusion to exclude coverage for accidents that occur between Florida and Puerto Rico as \"states\" creates a result that is perplexing at best, given the enterprise at hand.  The district court's rationale was that coverage for incidents occurring in international waters was not intended at all under the AIICO policy, but rather that the endorsement was intended to restrict coverage to Puerto Rico itself, on the ground that coverage for the voyage and Florida portions was intended to be obtained by the companies actually engaged in each of those legs of the transportation operation, i.e., Sea Barge and Maduro, respectively.  As with the watercraft exclusion, we prefer not to rest our decision on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore turn to the policy terms we do see as clearly indicating that the loss that occurred here was not contemplated under the AIICO policy, specifically Endorsements 1 and 13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Endorsement 1 of the AIICO policy, \"Named Insured,\" provides that the named insured under the policy is Ayala \"and/or any subsidiary, associated, affiliated, newly acquired, or controlled corporation and/or company as may now be constituted or hereafter formed, and over which the named insured maintains ownership or majority interest.\"   Fireman's Fund maintains that Sea Barge falls within the category of companies covered due to Ayala's \"ownership interest\" in Sea Barge.  However, the facts do not support this assertion:  Ayala owned only 20% of the outstanding shares of Sea Barge stock, which can be seen as neither ownership nor a majority interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Endorsement 13 of the AIICO policy, \"Additional Insured,\" lends additional credence to the view that the occurrence in question was not intended to be covered by the policy.  This endorsement states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>the unqualified word 'insured' also includes the below mentioned entities, but only with respect to their liability arising out of operations performed by the named insured.  Such coverage as is afforded under this clause shall only apply when contract conditions between the named insured and their principals so stipulate and then only insofar as is necessary to meet the requirements of such contract conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The list following this statement includes Sea Barge, as well as nine other companies.  It strains credulity to suggest that Ayala, or AIICO, intended all ten companies listed (including Sea Barge) to thereby gain unlimited coverage under the policy;  rather, coverage is specifically limited to that required by contracts between those listed and Ayala.  While Fireman's Fund maintains that the contract in question between Ayala and Sea Barge must be the Shareholders' Agreement, we conclude that the contracts the endorsement anticipates are discrete contracts between Ayala and the listed companies.  Therefore, here the relevant contract must be the stevedoring contract between Ayala and Sea Barge.  To read the endorsement otherwise overlooks both logic and the language of the endorsement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that straightforward construction of the policy's terms indicates that the loss that occurred was not contemplated as a covered one is further buttressed by our examination of the parties' intent, as evidenced by key documents and by sworn testimony.  See In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></span>, 637 (D.P.R.1992), aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602834\"><a href=\"/opinion/602834/in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire-litigation-holders-capital/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993) (terms of policy must be interpreted according to parties' purpose and intent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the two major documents in this case are the original Shareholders' Agreement, and the stevedoring contract between Sea Barge and Ayala.  The Shareholders' Agreement creates an interlocking structure of responsibility for the three forming companies, with the duties of each clearly specified.  In general, these duties are distinct--Ayala was to handle Puerto Rico-based stevedoring activities, Zapata those relating to the tugs and barges, and Maduro the Florida-based activities.  Article II, section 2.02(vi) of the Agreement stipulates that all parties shall cooperate with Sea Barge in obtaining cargo and cargo legal liability insurance, and that each policy will name all parties, in addition to Sea Barge, as additional insureds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Lemuel Toledo Campos, the insurance broker who advised Ayala, and Hernan F. Ayala-Parsi, the executive vice president of Ayala, stated in their affidavits that the intent of the insurance provisions in the Shareholders' Agreement was to avoid duplication of insurance costs by preventing any concurrent coverage.  Ayala-Parsi also stated that the parties' intent in the Agreement was that losses at sea were to be covered by Sea Barge's insurance, and that the AIICO policy's terms were consistent with this intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Stevedoring Agreement, the other major document here, is narrowly directed at structuring the stevedoring relationship between Sea Barge and Ayala.  Insofar as it addresses insurance coverage, it provides that Ayala will maintain worker's compensation insurance, as well as public liability insurance and property damage insurance \"arising out of operations performed hereto.\"   It further contains a limitation of liability clause providing that Sea Barge shall indemnify and hold harmless Ayala for any losses due to unseaworthiness or negligence of Sea Barge employees, and limiting Ayala's liability to losses caused by its own negligence, and then only as a stevedore and not as a bailee.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  The Agreement therefore appears to create a relationship between Ayala and Sea Barge under which Ayala's responsibilities to maintain insurance and its liability are narrowly circumscribed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, it is apparent from the testimony presented that AIICO and Ayala, the parties to the insurance policy in question, understood and intended that the AIICO policy would not extend to Sea Barge's activities other than in the limited circumstances set forth in the Stevedoring Agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Toledo Campos stated that the scope of Endorsement 1 of the AIICO policy was intended to include only those companies Ayala fully owned or held a majority interest in, and that the coverage of Sea Barge and the other companies listed in Endorsement 13 was limited to that required by contracts between the listed parties and Ayala.  Ulises Seijo, a general adjuster for AIICO, confirmed in his affidavit that Endorsement 1 applies only to those companies which Ayala owned or had a majority interest in, and he specifically stated, \"It [the endorsement] does not apply to Sea Barge.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reached the conclusion that the loss which occurred was not of the type covered or intended to be covered by the AIICO policy, we do not reach the second prong of the analysis noted above as to which policy is primary, and may draw our efforts to a close at this point.  We therefore affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the loss at sea of the nineteen containers was not within the purview of the coverage provided by the AIICO policy, we conclude that the district court correctly granted summary judgment for AIICO.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As the full names of the relevant entities in this case are somewhat unwieldy, each will be referred to by the following abbreviations:  Fireman's Fund Insurance Companies (\"Fireman's Fund\");  American International Insurance Company of Puerto Rico, Inc.
