Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Eligio Palmer-Contreras on brief pro se.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Jose A. Quiles-\r\nEspinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Camille Velez-Rive,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.    \r\n\nSeptember 11, 1998\r\n\n                                                Per Curiam.  The district court denied the motion of\r\nappellant Eligio Palmer-Contreras to \"equalize\" his sentence;\r\nappellant filed this motion under 18 U.S.C.  3553(a)(6). \r\nAfter reviewing the record and the parties' briefs, we conclude\r\nthat there was no statute or rule under which appellant was\r\nentitled to seek this relief.\r\n          First,  3553   which is part of the Sentencing\r\nReform Act   is only applicable to offenses committed after\r\nNovember 1, 1987, the effective date of the Act.  See United\r\nStates v. Glantz, 884 F.2d 1483, 1488 (1st Cir. 1989) (citations\r\nomitted).  Appellant committed his offense in October 1987. \r\nThus,  3553 does not apply to him.\r\n          This leaves the remedies in existence prior to the\r\neffective date of the Sentencing Reform Act   Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n35(b) and 28 U.S.C.  2255 and 2241.  The 120-day time limit\r\nof the applicable version of Rule 35(b) is jurisdictional.  See \r\nUnited States v. Ames, 743 F.2d 46, 47-48 (1st Cir. 1984) (per\r\ncuriam).  Appellant filed the instant motion about nine years\r\nafter the district court imposed sentence.  As a result, such\r\na motion would have been time-barred.\r\n          Construing appellant's motion as a petition for\r\nrelief under 28 U.S.C.  2255 also would not help appellant. \r\nThat is, appellant had filed a previous  2255 motion in July\r\n1990 and this motion was denied on the merits.  If the current\r\nmotion were construed as being brought under  2255, then, it\r\nwould be appellant's second.  Under the Antiterrorism and\r\nEffective Death Penalty Act   which applies here since the\r\nmotion at hand was filed in 1997, see Pratt v. United States,\r\n129 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S.Ct. 1807\r\n(1998)   appellant would be prohibited from filing a second or\r\nsuccessive motion in the district court absent permission from\r\nthis court.  See 28 U.S.C.  2255 (1996).  He has not received\r\nsuch permission.  Nor do we think such a motion would be\r\nsuccessful on the merits.  See Entrekin v. United States, 508\r\nF.2d 1328, 1330 (8th Cir. 1974) (a claim of disparate sentencing\r\nis not cognizable in a  2255 motion).\r\n          Finally,  2241 is not available to appellant in this\r\ncase because he is not contesting the conditions of his\r\nconfinement.  See Miller v. United States, 564 F.2d 103, 105\r\n(1st Cir. 1977).\r\n          As for the new argument concerning appellant's role\r\nin the offense, appellant has waived it by failing to raise it\r\nbelow.  See United States v. Dietz, 950 F.2d 50, 55 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).\r\n          The judgment of the district court dismissing\r\nappellant's motion is affirmed.\r\n",
