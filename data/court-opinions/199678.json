Plaintiffs-appellants,\n\nWater Keeper Alliance et al. (\"Water Keeper\"), appeal the denial\n\nof their motion for preliminary injunction to stay Department of\n\nNavy (the \"Navy,\" one of several defendants-appellees) military\n\nexercises on the island of Vieques off Puerto Rico. Water Keeper\n\nalleges   violations    by   the     Navy   of     certain   procedural\n\nrequirements under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act\n\n(\"ESA\"), 16 U.S.C. § 1536.    The district court found that Water\n\nKeeper had failed to show a strong likelihood of success on its\n\nESA theory, that its showing of potential irreparable harm had\n\nnot been strong, and that the balance of harms, as well as the\n\ninterest of the public, weighed in favor of denying the motion.\n\nSince the denial of Water Keeper's motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction, the district court has additionally determined that\n\nit lacked jurisdiction over the ESA claims because Water Keeper,\n\nprior to bringing suit, failed to provide adequate 60-day notice\n\nas required by the citizen suit provisions of the ESA.          See ESA\n\n§ 11(g)(2)(A), 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g)(2)(A).          We hold that notice\n\nwas adequate for the purposes of the particular ESA claim on\n\nappeal here, but affirm on the merits the district court's\n\ndenial of Water Keeper's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\n                       I. Statutory Framework\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f            The current appeal takes place against the background\n\nof a complex statutory framework that we examine at the outset\n\nof our opinion.      The ESA directs federal agencies to insure that\n\nagency   action      \"is   not    likely    to    jeopardize    the    continued\n\nexistence of any endangered species or threatened species or\n\nresult in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of\n\nsuch species.\" ESA § 7(a)(2), 16 U.S.C. § 1536(a)(2).                       This\n\nsubstantive requirement is backed up by a scheme of procedural\n\nrequirements that set up a consultation process between the\n\nagency (in this case the Navy) and the National Marine Fisheries\n\nService (\"NMFS\") and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\")\n\n(jointly,      the   \"Services\")1    to     determine     whether     endangered\n\nspecies or critical habitat are jeopardized by proposed agency\n\naction   and    whether    this    adverse       impact   may   be    avoided   or\n\nminimized. See ESA § 7, 16 U.S.C. 1536.\n\n\n\n    1 Under the ESA, the agency consults with the \"Secretary,\"\ndefined as the \"the Secretary of the Interior [to whom the FWS\nreports] or the Secretary of Commerce [to whom the NMFS\nreports].\" ESA § 3(15); 16 U.S.C. § 1533(15).          Under the\nregulations, the agency consults with the \"Director.\" The\n\"Director\" is defined as \"the Assistant Administrator for\nFisheries    for   the   National   Oceanic    and   Atmospheric\nAdministration [under which the NMFS is housed], or his\nauthorized representative; or the Fish and Wildlife Service\nregional director, or his authorized representative, for the\nregion where the action would be carried out.\" 50 C.F.R. §\n402.02. The consultation function is carried out in practice by\nthe FWS and the NMFS. The agency conducts separate consultations\nwith the FWS and the NMFS.\n\n                                      -5-\n\f             Under the ESA, \"[e]ach Federal agency shall review its\n\nactions at the earliest possible time to determine whether any\n\naction may affect listed species or critical habitat.\"                         50\n\nC.F.R. § 402.14(a).          Although the determination of possible\n\neffects is ultimately the agency's responsibility, see 51 Fed.\n\nReg. 19949, in making this determination, the agency may consult\n\nwith the Services through \"informal consultation.\"                     The term\n\nsimply describes discussions and correspondence between the\n\nServices     and   the    agency   designed    to     assist   the    agency   in\n\ndetermining whether its proposed action is likely to impact\n\nlisted species or critical habitat. Id. § 402.13. If, at the\n\nconclusion of the informal consultation, the Services issue\n\nwritten concurrences that a \"proposed action is not likely to\n\nadversely affect any listed species or critical habitat,\" the\n\nagency may proceed with the action without further consultation\n\nbetween the parties.        Id. § 402.14(b)(1).\n\n             However, where the proposed agency action rises to the\n\nlevel of a \"major construction activity\" the determination as to\n\nwhether agency action may affect listed species or critical\n\nhabitat cannot be made through informal consultation alone, but\n\nmust be based on a \"biological assessment.\"              Id. § 402.12(b)(1);\n\nsee   also    51   Fed.    Reg.    19948    (noting    that    the    biological\n\nassessment     may   be    conducted       simultaneously      with    informal\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fconsultation or without any informal consultation).                A \"major\n\nconstruction activity\" is \"a construction project (or other\n\nundertaking having similar physical impacts) which is a major\n\nFederal action significantly affecting the quality of the human\n\nenvironment as referred to in the National Environmental Policy\n\nAct [NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)]. 2 50 C.F.R. § 402.02.                 The\n\nbiological assessment is a study that \"evaluate[s] the potential\n\neffects of the action on listed and proposed species . . . and\n\ndetermine[s] whether any such species or habitat are likely to\n\nbe adversely affected by the action . . . .\" 50 C.F.R. §\n\n402.12(a).     If,       following    completion     of   the   biological\n\nassessment, the Services issue written concurrences that the\n\n\"proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any listed\n\nspecies or critical habitat,\" the consultation is terminated.\n\nId. at § 402.14(b).\n\n         If,   on    the    other    hand,   based   on   either   informal\n\nconsultation   or    a   biological    assessment,    the   Services    are\n\n\n\n    2 The referenced paragraph of NEPA, in turn, does not define\n\"a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of\nthe human environment\" in substantive terms but rather specifies\nthat an environmental impact statement must accompany a proposal\nfor such action. 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)(i).     As discussed in\nSection V infra, courts have found that whether an agency is\nrequired to prepare a biological assessment depends on whether\nit is required to prepare an environmental impact statement\nunder NEPA. See Hawksbill Sea Turtle v. FEMA, 11 F. Supp. 2d\n529, 544 (D.V.I. 1998).\n\n                                     -7-\n\funwilling to concur that the agency action is unlikely to impact\n\nprotected species and habitat, or if the agency independently\n\nconcludes that its actions may affect listed species or critical\n\nhabitat,    the    agency        is        required     to    initiate     \"formal\n\nconsultation.\" See id., § 402.14(a)&(b)(1).                  Formal consultation\n\nis initiated by the written request of the agency describing the\n\naction and the manner in which it may affect listed species and\n\ncritical   habitat.    Id.   §    402.14(c).           Significantly,      \"formal\n\nconsultation shall not be initiated by the Federal agency until\n\nany   required    biological      assessment          has    been   completed   and\n\nsubmitted to the [Services] in accordance with § 402.12.\"                       Id.\n\n§ 402.14(c).      Nonetheless, formal consultation may take place\n\nwithout a biological assessment if the action is not a major\n\nconstruction activity.\n\n           After   a   period         of    review    and    discussion,    formal\n\nconsultation culminates in the Services' issuance of biological\n\nopinions advising the agency \"whether the action is likely to\n\njeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result\n\nin the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat,\"\n\nand, if so, whether \"reasonable and prudent alternatives\" exist\n\nto allow the agency to comply with the ESA.                          50 C.F.R. §\n\n402.14(h); see also ESA § 7(b)(3)(A), 16 U.S.C. § 1536(b)(3)(A).\n\nIf the Services conclude that the action, or the implementation\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fof any reasonable and prudent alternatives, comply with the ESA,\n\nthe Services must also issue an \"incidental take statement\" that\n\nspecifies the amount or extent of the authorized taking of the\n\nspecies.     ESA § 7(b)(4), 16 U.S.C. § 1536(b)(4); 50 C.F.R. §\n\n402.14(i).\n\n           With the basics of the statutory framework in place,\n\nwe next consider the application of the ESA to the Navy in\n\nrelation to its training exercises on Vieques.\n\n                            II. Background\n\n           The Navy has used the island for military exercises\n\nsince 1941, including ship-to-shore and aerial bombing with live\n\nammunition.    Thirteen endangered and threatened species live on\n\nthe island of Vieques and in surrounding water, and, as a\n\nresult, in 1980 and 1981 respectively, pursuant to the ESA and\n\nafter   formal    consultation,   the   NMFS    and   the   FWS   issued\n\nbiological opinions regarding the effects of Navy exercises on\n\nthe listed species and critical habitat.       Both Services found no\n\njeopardy to any listed species or critical habitat from naval\n\nexercises on Vieques.\n\n           Beginning in 1995, the NMFS and the FWS asked the Navy\n\nto   reinitiate   \"formal   consultations\"     with   the   Services   to\n\nreexamine the effect of the military exercises on the endangered\n\nand threatened species of the island.          The Services explained\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fthat new information regarding the listed species had been\n\nobtained since 1981, that dead or injured species had been found\n\nafter training exercises (the original biological opinion did\n\nnot authorize any takings pursuant to ESA section 7(b)(4), 16\n\nU.S.C. § 1536(b)(4)), and that reinitiation was typical after\n\nfive   years.      In   January      2000,    after       a    period    of   informal\n\nconsultation, the Navy agreed to initiate formal consultation\n\nwith FWS and NMFS.          The Navy further indicated its willingness\n\nto prepare a biological assessment in anticipation of formal\n\nconsultation, despite the fact that, in its own determination,\n\nit was not required to do so under the regulations. (See 50\n\nC.F.R.   §    402.12(b)(1);          51   Fed.     Reg.       19945,    contemplating\n\nvoluntary preparation of a biological assessment to assist in\n\nthe determination of whether formal consultation is required.)\n\nOn January 31, 2000, in the same month that the Navy agreed to\n\nreinitiate formal consultation with the Services concerning its\n\nuse of the Vieques range, the President issued an Executive\n\nOrder restricting the use of the Vieques training range to no\n\nmore   than   90     days      per   year    and    using       only    non-explosive\n\nordnance.       65      Fed.    Reg.      5729     (Feb.      24,   2000).      These\n\nrestrictions were put in place pending a referendum by the\n\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fcitizens of Vieques on the future of Navy exercises on the\n\nisland.3\n\n            The Navy has clarified that the biological assessment\n\nit agreed to prepare would \"address continuing operations of the\n\nVieques Inner Range assuming the referendum regarding the Navy's\n\nfuture use of the Range passes . . . .\"4 Indeed, the Navy\n\ncompleted    and   submitted   this   biological   assessment   to   the\n\nServices in January 2001 and formal consultation between the\n\nparties is currently proceeding.          However, the Navy further\n\ninformed the Services that, pending the completion of formal\n\nconsultation for long-term use of the range, it would continue\n\nto conduct periodic training exercises on Vieques in compliance\n\nwith the conditions of the Executive Order.          The NMFS and the\n\nFWS initially agreed to engage in informal consultation with the\n\nNavy on an exercise-by-exercise basis for the interim period and\n\nissued concurrences of no likely adverse effect for the May and\n\nJune exercises, thereby exempting the Navy from the requirement\n\nto enter formal consultation with regard to these exercises.\n\n\n     3\n     The referendum, scheduled for November 2001, gives the\ncitizens of Vieques a choice between allowing naval training,\nwith live ordnance, to go forward indefinitely in return for a\n$50 million infrastructure development package, and requiring\nthat the Navy leave the island by May of 2003.\n     4\n     Letter from J.K. Moran, Rear Admiral, U.S. Navy to Sam\nHamilton, Regional Director, FWS, R. Doc. 1 Ex. 22 (June 13,\n2000).\n\n                                 -11-\n\f             After June 2000, the FWS changed its position and\n\ninformed     the    Navy     that    it    would    require       \"interim    formal\n\nconsultation\" for all exercises during the interim period of\n\nAugust 2000 to December 2001.              The Navy agreed and, on July 12,\n\n2000,      provided FWS with a \"consultation package\" covering the\n\nplanned training exercises through 2001.                   On July 27, 2000, the\n\nFWS issued a biological opinion reviewing the effects of the\n\nproposed interim exercises on the endangered and threatened\n\nspecies     and    finding    that   the       exercises    were    not   likely    to\n\njeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result\n\nin   the    destruction       of    critical       habitat.        FWS    issued    an\n\nincidental take statement with reasonable and prudent measures\n\nto ensure that any take would be minimized.                  Biological Opinion,\n\nR. Doc. 12, Ex. 24 (July 27, 2000).                   For its part, the NMFS\n\ncontinued to evaluate each interim exercise informally on an\n\nindividual basis and has issued written concurrences for each\n\nexercise, finding no likelihood of adverse impact.\n\n             The issue on appeal here grows out of the interim\n\nformal consultations between the Navy and the FWS concerning the\n\nNavy's     training    activities         on   Vieques     from    August    2000   to\n\nDecember 2001.        The ESA includes a citizen suit provision \"to\n\nenjoin any person, including the United States and any other\n\ngovernmental instrumentality or agency\" for a violation of the\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fESA   or    issued    regulations.    ESA    §   11(g)(1)(A),   16    U.S.C.    §\n\n1540(g)(1)(A).          Invoking    standing      under   the   citizen      suit\n\nprovision, Water Keeper argues that the Navy's interim exercises\n\non Vieques constitute a \"major construction activity,\" that the\n\nNavy was therefore required to prepare a biological assessment\n\ndirected at the effects of the interim training exercises, and\n\nthat,      contrary    to   the    Navy's    assertions,    the      July    12th\n\nconsultation package did not satisfy this requirement.                      Water\n\nKeeper contends that the process by which the Navy received the\n\ngo-ahead from the FWS to carry out exercises on Vieques from\n\nAugust 2000 to December 2001 was therefore procedurally flawed\n\nand the Navy's activities must be enjoined pending compliance\n\nwith the ESA procedural requirements.5\n\n\n      5\n     In the underlying case, Water Keeper also has alleged\nviolations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, 42\nU.S.C. § 6903, violations of the Equal Protection Clause, and\nillegal takings of endangered species in violation of section 9\nof the ESA, 16 U.S.C. § 1538. Water Keeper has further argued\nthat the biological opinion issued by the FWS on July 27 was\n\"arbitrary and capricious\" under the Administrative Procedure\nAct, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), in part because it was prepared\nwithout the benefit of the biological assessment. Water Keeper\nraised this legal theory in support of its motion for a\npreliminary injunction and it was considered by the district\ncourt (although determined not likely to succeed) as well as\nbriefed by the appellees in this appeal. However, Water Keeper\nappears to have abandoned this theory, at least for the purposes\nof its appeal from the denial of the motion for a preliminary\ninjunction, by not briefing the issue.      Additionally, Water\nKeeper's counsel unequivocally stated during oral argument that\nthe only issue on appeal was the claim against the Navy for\nfailure to prepare a biological assessment. We accordingly do\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            It is important to note that Water Keeper's argument\n\nis a narrow one.     As discussed above, the Navy has submitted a\n\nbiological assessment to the Services regarding the long-term\n\nuse of Vieques for naval exercises and formal consultation is\n\nproceeding.    Water Keeper is not contesting the legality of the\n\nformal consultation addressing the long-term use of Vieques, nor\n\nis it contesting the exercise-by-exercise informal consultation\n\nbetween the Navy and the NMFS for the interim use of the island.\n\nWater Keeper's sole focus, at least for purposes of this appeal,\n\nis alleged procedural violations in the consultations between\n\nthe Navy and the FWS for exercises from August 2000 to December\n\n2001.      Consequently,     Water   Keeper's    request   for    injunctive\n\nrelief, if granted, would only stay Navy exercises through\n\nDecember 2001.                  III.    District Court Proceedings\n\n            The district court denied Water Keeper's motion for a\n\npreliminary injunction. Water Keeper Alliance v. U.S. Dep't of\n\nDefense,    No.   00-2295,    R.     Doc.   74   (D.P.R.   June    9,   2001)\n\n(hereinafter \"Water Keeper I\").         The court assumed that the Navy\n\nwas required to prepare a biological assessment, but held that\n\nthe appellees were likely to succeed on the argument that, for\n\n\n\nnot consider the claim against the FWS. See United States v.\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"issues adverted to in\na perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\nargumentation, are deemed waived\").\n\n                                     -14-\n\fthe   interim   exercises,   the    consultation   package    met   the\n\nrequirements of the biological assessment.         Id. at 5-8.      The\n\ndistrict court further found that Water Keeper's showing of\n\npotential irreparable harm had not been strong.        Id. at 12-13.\n\nFinally, the court held that the balance of equities favored the\n\ndefendants, who pointed to concrete national security concerns\n\nover the more abstract harm to species asserted by Water Keeper,\n\nand that the public interest would consequently be harmed by a\n\ngrant of preliminary injunctive relief.      Id. at 13-16.\n\n          Water Keeper filed a timely appeal challenging the\n\ndenial of its request for preliminary injunctive relief.             We\n\ndenied Water Keeper's request for a stay of planned exercises\n\npending a decision on the appeal which was expedited.\n\n          Complicating our review, the district court has since\n\ndismissed Water Keeper's ESA claims, apparently essentially the\n\nsame claims that are on appeal, for lack of adequate notice.\n\nThe citizen suit provision of the ESA requires sixty days notice\n\nof intent to bring suit.           ESA § 11(g)(2)(A), 16 U.S.C. §\n\n1540(g)(2)(A).    The court found that Water Keeper's Notice of\n\nIntent to Sue, R. Doc. 55, Ex. A (May 16, 2000) (\"Notice\"), did\n\nnot include the claims upon which it sought relief.          It did so\n\nbecause the Notice did not (indeed could not have, since it\n\npredated it) reference the July 2000 biological opinion, which\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fwas the culmination of the formal consultation for the interim\n\nexercises, as the basis of its grievance.           Water Keeper Alliance\n\nv. U.S. Dep't of Defense, No. 00-2295, R. Doc. 85 (D.P.R. July\n\n17, 2001) at 15-25 (hereinafter \"Water Keeper II\").             Appellants\n\nhave filed a motion for reconsideration of the ESA dismissal\n\nand, in the alternative, for a certification of interlocutory\n\nappeal.    That motion is pending.\n\n            We briefly consider the notice question in Section IV\n\nand find that notice was adequate as to the ESA claim against\n\nthe Navy. We then devote the bulk of our discussion, under\n\nSection V, to an examination of the motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction on its merits.\n\n                                IV. Notice\n\n            Although the certification for interlocutory appeal on\n\nthe adequacy of notice is still pending, appellees correctly\n\nnote that we have jurisdiction to consider adequacy of notice as\n\na matter that is intertwined with the issues on appeal.                    See\n\nXerox Fin. Servs. Life Ins. Co. v. High Plains Ltd. P'ship, 44\n\nF.3d 1033, 1038 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that, because the\n\nconsideration     of   the   preliminary   injunction     was   \"colorably\n\ndependent\" on the denial of defendant's Rule 60(b) motion, this\n\ndenial    was   also   reviewable   on   appeal);    Alloyd   Gen.   Co.    v.\n\nBuilding Leasing Co., 361 F.2d 359, 363 (1st Cir. 1966) (\"Our\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fjurisdiction embraces a consideration of such questions as are\n\nbasic to and underlie the order supporting the appeal.\").\n\n          We have previously read the 60-day notice requirement\n\nin environmental statute citizen suits strictly.   See Garcia v.\n\nCecos Int'l, Inc. 761 F.2d 76, 78-82 (1st Cir. 1985) (Resource\n\nConservation and Recovery Act); Massachusetts v. United States\n\nVeterans Admin., 541 F.2d 119 (1st Cir. 1976) (Clean Water Act);\n\ncf. Maine Audubon Soc'y v. Purslow, 907 F.2d 265 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(finding that district court did not abuse its discretion when\n\nit sanctioned counsel for bringing ESA suit before 60 days after\n\nnotice of intent to sue had been given). The notice provision\n\nprovides agencies with an opportunity to resolve the dispute and\n\ntake any necessary corrective measures before a resort to the\n\ncourts,   Southwest Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Bureau\n\nof Reclamation, 143 F.3d 515, 520 (9th Cir. 1998), and we are\n\nnot in disagreement with the district court that the notice must\n\nadequately inform the agency of the exact grievances against it,\n\nif it is to fulfill this purpose.    Nevertheless, we find that\n\nWater Keeper did in fact provide adequate notice as to the\n\nnarrow claim at issue here -- the Navy's failure to conduct a\n\nbiological assessment.\n\n          The district court held that Water Keeper could not\n\nbring an ESA claim against the FWS for alleged deficiencies in\n\n\n                              -17-\n\fthe     July    2000     biological      opinion,       without   specifically\n\nreferencing that opinion in its Notice.              Water Keeper II at 18-\n\n25.     However, the court did not consider the adequacy of the\n\nnotice for purposes of the ESA claim against the Navy.                 The May\n\n2000 Notice, sent before the Navy and the FWS entered formal\n\nconsultations for the interim period, admittedly does not notify\n\nthe Navy that Water Keeper disputes its July 2000 determination\n\nto bypass a biological assessment in favor of a consultation\n\npackage.       But the letter does take issue with the fact that the\n\nNavy has been conducting military activities on Vieques for some\n\nyears     without      the     benefit    of    a    biological    assessment\n\nincorporating new scientific evidence.6 To say that the Navy was\n\nnot on notice that Water Keeper would object to the failure to\n\nprepare a biological assessment for its interim activities, when\n\nthe   Notice     makes    it   clear     that   Water    Keeper   intended    to\n\nchallenge      an   ongoing    delinquency      in   the   preparation   of    a\n\nbiological assessment, would be setting the bar for adequacy of\n\n\n\n      6\n     Water Keeper states that \"[u]nder § 7(c)(1) of ESA each\nFederal agency shall conduct a biological assessment for\nidentifying any endangered species or threatened species . . .\n.\" Notice of Intent to Sue, R. Doc. 55 Ex. A (May 16, 2000) at\n5. Water Keeper additionally posits that \"[s]ince th[e] 1981\nbiological assessment, scientists have compiled new information\nindicating that the Navy's activities may be destroying\nindividuals and injuring their chances for survival . . . .\n[Through its refusal to reinitiate consultation] the Navy has\nviolated . . . § 7(c)(1) of ESA.\" Id. at 6.\n\n                                       -18-\n\fnotice too high.   We therefore find that notice was sufficient\n\nfor purposes of the ESA challenge against the Navy.\n\n        V. Denial of Motion for Preliminary Injunction\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n         Under this circuit's formulation, trial courts follow\n\na four-part framework in determining whether the grant or denial\n\nof preliminary injunctive relief is appropriate.   The district\n\ncourt considers: first, the likelihood that the party requesting\n\nthe injunction will succeed on the merits; second, the potential\n\nfor irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; third, the\n\nhardship to the nonmovant if enjoined compared to the hardship\n\nto the movant if injunctive relief is denied; and fourth, the\n\neffect of the court's ruling on the public interest.      Ross-\n\nSimons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 16 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n         The standard of review for an appellate court reviewing\n\nthe grant or denial of a preliminary injunction is abuse of\n\ndiscretion.   Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16.    This deferential\n\nstandard, however, applies to \"issues of judgment and balancing\n\nof conflicting factors,\" and we still review rulings on abstract\n\nlegal issues de novo and findings of fact for clear error.\n\nCablevision of Boston, Inc. v. Public Improvement Comm'n of the\n\nCity of Boston, 184 F.3d 88, 96 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting Ocean\n\n\n                              -19-\n\fSpray Cranberries, Inc. v. Pepsico, Inc., 160 F.3d 58, 61 n.1\n\n(1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n            We    consequently    review   the    district   court's   legal\n\nfindings under the \"likelihood of success\" prong de novo.                  In\n\ncontrast,    we    review   the   district       court's   judgment    calls,\n\napplying appropriate standards, under the remaining three prongs\n\nfor abuse of discretion.\n\nB. Likelihood of Success\n\n            De novo review of a district court judgment requires\n\nthat we view the case from the same position as the district\n\ncourt.   See Environmental Protection Info. Ctr. v. The Simpson\n\nTimber Co. 255 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir. 2001).                The citizen\n\nsuit provision of the ESA, § 11(g), 16 U.S.C. § 1540(g), does\n\nnot incorporate a standard for judicial review.               What standard\n\nof review applies depends on the question being asked. Although\n\ncircuit courts often look to the standard of review set out in\n\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706, those\n\ncircuits which have considered the issue have adopted standards\n\nof review based on the relevant portions of the APA governing\n\nwhat the agency has done (or failed to do).                For instance, in\n\nBiodiversity Legal Foundation v. Babbitt, 146 F.3d 1249 (10th\n\nCir. 1998), the court applied APA § 706(1) (stating that \"[t]he\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\freviewing court shall -- (1) compel agency action unlawfully\n\nwithheld or unreasonably delayed\") to review FWS's refusal to\n\nmake a preliminary finding on a listing decision.                See id. at\n\n1252 (stating that \"our review . . . focuses on . . . whether\n\nthe Service's resulting failure to make a 90-day finding on the\n\n. . . petition is agency action unlawfully withheld\"). In other\n\ncases, where the court is reviewing, for example, the Forest\n\nService's    timber   management    plan,    or   the   Forest    Service's\n\napproval of a plan to drill in the wild, the arbitrary or\n\ncapricious standard of § 706(2)(A) has been applied. See Sierra\n\nClub v. Glickman, 67 F.3d 90, 95 (5th Cir. 1995); Cabinet\n\nMountains Wilderness v. Peterson, 685 F.2d 678, 685-86 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1982).     In still other cases, such as where a party\n\nchallenges FWS's refusal to reinitiate consultation, § 706(2)(D)\n\n(\"without observance of procedure required by law\") is applied.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Info. Ctr., 255 F.3d at 1078, 1085.\n\nEven in cases citing to § 706(2)(A), it may be the \"otherwise\n\nnot in accordance with law\" clause, rather than the \"arbitrary,\n\ncapricious\" clause that governs.          See id. at 1078.\n\n            This circuit has little discussion in caselaw on the\n\nstandard of review of various issues which may arise under the\n\n                                   -21-\n\fESA.       This case, an expedited preliminary injunction appeal,\n\ndoes not require us to resolve those issues.             Even if we were to\n\nview Water Keeper's arguments under the most favorable standard\n\nof review to them -- essentially as legal issues of statutory\n\nconstruction, and without Chevron7 deference to the agency --\n\nWater Keeper has not shown probability of success.\n\n             As discussed in Section II supra, the requirement of\n\na biological assessment is triggered if the agency action is a\n\nmajor construction activity.         The relationship between a major\n\nconstruction      activity,   a    biological    assessment        and   formal\n\nconsultation is a complicated one, deserving some more detailed\n\nexplanation at this point.           Formal consultation may not be\n\ninitiated before a required biological assessment is completed,\n\n50 C.F.R. § 402.14(c); that is not to say, however, that a\n\nbiological assessment is always required for formal consultation\n\nto   proceed.    What   triggers   the     requirement    of   a   biological\n\nassessment is that the action is a major construction activity,\n\nId. § 402.12(b), and not that the agency and Services have\n\ndetermined that they must enter formal consultation.                Hence, the\n\nagency and the Services may conduct formal consultation without\n\n\n\n\n       7\n     Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837\n(1984).\n\n                                    -22-\n\fa biological assessment if the action in question is not a major\n\nconstruction      activity.       Conversely,          the   preparation      of   a\n\nbiological assessment does not automatically push the parties\n\ninto    formal    consultation,       but     rather,    formal    consultation\n\nfollows only if a biological assessment shows that the action\n\n\"may affect listed species or critical habitat.\" See id. §\n\n402.14 (a)&(b).\n\n              The Navy and the FWS had reached an understanding,\n\ndiscussed in Section III supra, that they were conducting formal\n\nconsultations for the interim period of August 2000 to December\n\n2001; indeed the formal consultations concluded in the issuance\n\nof a biological opinion and an incidental take statement.                       The\n\nformal   consultations     were       procedurally      flawed    if   they    were\n\ninitiated before \"any required biological assessment had been\n\ncompleted . . .\" (emphasis added).                Id.        § 402.14(c).       Our\n\nfirst    point    of   inquiry    therefore       is    whether    the   interim\n\nactivities       constituted      a     \"major     construction        activity\"\n\ntriggering the statutory requirement of a biological assessment.\n\nId. § 402.12(b)(1).        The district court did not address the\n\nfirst of these questions, but instead appears to have assumed\n\nthat    the    interim   training      activities       constituted      a    major\n\nconstruction activity under 50 C.F.R. § 402.12 (b)(1).                          See\n\n\n\n\n                                       -23-\n\fWater Keeper I at 6.            We believe that the question is more\n\ndifficult than the district court acknowledges.\n\n              A \"major construction activity\" is defined as a project\n\nthat \"is a major Federal action significantly affecting the\n\nquality of the human environment as referred to in the National\n\nEnvironmental Policy Act [NEPA, 42 U.S.C. § 4332(2)(C)].\"                        50\n\nC.F.R.    §    402.02.         NEPA   requires      the   preparation      of    an\n\nenvironmental        impact    statement      for   \"major    Federal     actions\n\nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\"\n\n42 U.S.C. § 4332 (2)(C).            Appellees argue that, by implication,\n\nagency action can constitute a major construction activity, only\n\nif it necessitated the preparation of an environmental impact\n\nstatement.          Because    no   environmental     impact    statement       was\n\nprepared for the Navy's interim training activities on Vieques,\n\nappellees contend, the training activities from July 2000 to\n\nDecember 2001 do not constitute a \"major construction activity\"\n\nrequiring a biological assessment.             See Hawksbill Sea Turtle v.\n\nFEMA, 11 F. Supp. 2d 529, 544 (D.V.I. 1998).                 Appellees further\n\npoint    to   the    interim    nature   of   the   training    activities       in\n\nquestion as well as the fact that they are conducted with inert\n\nordnance to argue that they do not rise to the level of an\n\naction    significantly        affecting      the   quality    of   the    human\n\nenvironment.\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\f              Water Keeper counters that the NEPA regulations permit\n\nthe agency, once a comprehensive environmental impact statement\n\nis in place, to rely on smaller-scale environmental assessments\n\nfor \"an action included within the entire program or policy.\" 40\n\nC.F.R.    §    1502.20.      Water   Keeper      points    out   that   the   Navy's\n\nactivities on Vieques were previously determined to be major\n\nfederal actions subject to an environmental impact statement,\n\nsee Romero-Barcelo v.           Brown, 478 F. Supp. 646, 704 (D.P.R.\n\n1979), aff'd in part, vacated in part on other grounds, 643 F.2d\n\n835 (1st Cir. 1981),            rev'd on other grounds, 456 U.S. 305\n\n(1982),       and   argues    that    the     interim      activities    have    not\n\nnecessitated        the   preparation       of   a   new   environmental      impact\n\nstatement because they fell into the exception created by the\n\nregulations for actions that are part of a larger program.\n\n    In considering a request for a preliminary injunction, we\n\nneed not determine the outcome on the merits \"with absolute\n\nassurance.\"         Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16; Narragansett Indian\n\nTribe v. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1991).                   We cannot say\n\nthat Water Keeper has shown a probability at this stage that the\n\nNavy violated the ESA because it concluded that the interim\n\nactivities -- for which no environmental impact statement had\n\nbeen prepared and which were arguably materially different from\n\nprevious naval exercises in their short term nature and use of\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\fonly inert ordnance -- did not constitute a major construction\n\nactivity necessitating a biological assessment.8\n\n    But even assuming that the Navy's activities did necessitate\n\nthe preparation of a biological assessment, Water Keeper has not\n\nshown that the consultation package was not the functional\n\nequivalent of a biological assessment.         In reaching the same\n\nconclusion, the district court focused on the fact that the\n\ncontents of a biological assessment are discretionary, see 50\n\nC.F.R. § 402.12(f), and that the Navy's consultation package\n\ncontained much of the discretionary content of a biological\n\nassessment,   including   a   list   of   endangered   and   threatened\n\nspecies, description of the species' habitats, reasons for their\n\ndecline, action taken to protect the species, results of aerial\n\nsurveys, and a list of restrictions on military exercises.\n\nWater Keeper I at 8.\n\n    Of course the discretionary nature of the contents of the\n\nbiological assessment should not detract from the fact that it\n\nis prepared in fulfillment of section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, 16\n\nU.S.C. § 1536(a)(2), see also 50 C.F.R. 402.14(d), and that it\n\n\n    8Although the regulations are not entirely clear as to who\ndecides whether an agency action is a major construction\nactivity (i.e. the agency or the Services), the Services'\nexplanatory comments suggest that the Navy would make this\ndetermination: \"The biological assessment process begins when a\nFederal agency decides that its action is a major construction\nactivity . . . .\" 51 Fed. Reg. 19946.\n\n                                -26-\n\fconsequently must \"use the best scientific and commercial data\n\navailable.\"         We are unable, however, to find that Water Keeper\n\nis likely to succeed on the argument that the Navy did not use\n\nthe   best    scientific      and   commercial   data     available.       Water\n\nKeeper's contentions to this end essentially boil down to the\n\nfact that the Navy did not consult two available studies on\n\nbrown pelicans, an omission that is not sufficient to find the\n\nconsultation package inadequate, at least at this preliminary\n\nstage.    Water Keeper's additional assertion that the Navy could\n\nnot have possibly relied on the best scientific and commercial\n\ndata available, given that it had not completed many of the\n\nstudies      that    would   be   incorporated   in   a   future    biological\n\nassessment      for    the   long-term   use   of   the   island,    has    more\n\nanalytical appeal.           However, the very fact that these studies\n\nwere not completed means that they were not available at the\n\ntime of the preparation of the consultation package.                 We cannot\n\nsay that the decision by the Navy and the FWS to proceed with\n\nthe formal consultation on the interim training exercises before\n\nthe completion of the long term studies violated the ESA's\n\nprocedural requirements.\n\n       We therefore hold that the district court was correct in\n\nfinding that Water Keeper was unlikely to succeed on the merits.\n\nWe    review the next three prongs in the standard for preliminary\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\finjunction for abuse of discretion, as discussed above, and\n\naccordingly decide them with relative speed.\n\nC. Potential for Irreparable Harm\n\n    To be entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, appellants\n\nmust demonstrate that they will otherwise suffer irreparable\n\nharm.   The district court found that Water Keeper's showing of\n\nirreparable harm was insufficient.      We agree.\n\n    Water Keeper first contends that a procedural violation of\n\nthe ESA itself constitutes irreparable injury.          It is true that\n\nthe ESA restricts the equity power of the court as to findings\n\nof irreparable injury.     See Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437\n\nU.S. 153 (1978).      But Water Keeper’s argument is misplaced and\n\nignores context.      On the facts of this case, Water Keeper has\n\nnot shown that the statute entitles it to insist on the\n\nprocedure   of   no   action   taking   place   until    a   biological\n\nassessment has been filed with the Service.         Here, there is a\n\nserious question as to whether the Navy was required to prepare\n\na new biological assessment and whether what the Navy submitted\n\nwas not the functional equivalent of a biological assessment.\n\nThis context places the case outside of Hill and outside of the\n\nreach of Massachusetts v. Watt, 716 F.2d 946 (1st Cir. 1983).\n\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f      As a result, the district court correctly required that\n\nWater Keeper show potential for irreparable harm \"apart from the\n\nharm that they argue is inherent in a procedural violation of\n\nthe ESA's consultation requirements . . . .\" Water Keeper I at\n\n12.       Furthermore, the court did not abuse its discretion when\n\nit    determined     that   Water       Keeper's    assertions   concerning\n\nirreparable harm stemming from the \"death of even a single\n\nmember of an endangered species\" were insufficient to justify\n\ngranting injunctive relief.             Id. at 12.        In support of its\n\nposition of irreparable harm, Water Keeper can only point to\n\nvague concerns as to long-term damage to the endangered species\n\nexpressed by FWS and NMFS.9         In the absence of a more concrete\n\nshowing of probable deaths during the interim period and of how\n\nthese     deaths   may   impact   the    species,   the    district   court's\n\nconclusion that Water Keeper has failed to show potential for\n\nirreparable harm was not an abuse of discretion.\n\nD. Balance of Relevant Impositions & Public Interest\n\n      In response to the claimed danger to endangered species\n\nasserted by Water Keeper, the Navy argues that the loss of\n\nVieques as a training ground will adversely affect military\n\n\n      9\n     See Letter from NMFS, Southeast Regional Office to Captain\nJ.K. Stark Jr., USN, Commanding Officer, U.S. Naval Station, R.\nDoc. 1 Ex.19 (July 1, 1999). Letter from FWS to Rear Admiral\nJ.K. Moran, Department of the Navy, Commander Navy Region\nSoutheast, R. Doc. 1, Ex 20 (June 15, 2000).\n\n                                    -29-\n\fpreparedness. Water Keeper correctly contends that, by enacting\n\nthe ESA, Congress has already determined that the \"'balance of\n\nhardships and the public interest tips heavily in favor of\n\nprotected species.'\" Strahan v. Coxe, 127 F.3d 155, 171 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (quoting National Wildlife Fed'n v.    Burlington N.\n\nR.R., 23 F.3d 1508, 1510 (9th Cir. 1994)). See also Tennessee\n\nValley Auth., 437 U.S. at 184-185 (finding that the ESA \"reveals\n\na conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species\n\npriority over the 'primary missions' of federal agencies\").\n\nWhile these precedents direct us to give the endangerment of\n\nspecies, as alleged by Water Keeper, the utmost consideration,\n\nwe do not think that they can blindly compel our decision in\n\nthis case because the harm asserted by the Navy implicates\n\nnational security and therefore deserves greater weight than the\n\neconomic harm at issue in Strahan.10\n\n\n    10Water Keeper argued, for the first time during oral\nargument, that the appropriate place for appellees' military\npreparedness argument is not the balancing of harms under a\npreliminary injunction, but the national security exception\nunder ESA § 7(j): \"Notwithstanding any other provision of this\nchapter, the [Endangered Species Committee, see 16 U.S.C. § 1536\n(e)] shall grant an exemption for any agency action if the\nSecretary of Defense finds that such exemption is necessary for\nreasons of national security.\" 16 U.S.C. § 1536(j).        Water\nKeeper has forfeited this argument by not properly raising it in\nits brief. Except in extraordinary circumstances, a court of\nappeals will not consider an issue raised for the first time at\noral argument. See Piazza v. Aponte Roque, 909 F.2d 35, 37 (1st\nCir. 1990).\n\n\n                             -30-\n\f      Water Keeper argues in response that military preparedness\n\nwill not be affected to the extent that appellees allege.                        Water\n\nKeeper first points out that the Navy statements on which the\n\ndistrict    court     relied      in     determining     the   harm      to   national\n\nsecurity    assumed     that      the     training    exercises     utilized      live\n\nordnance,    whereas        the    Navy    was   utilizing     inert      ordinance,\n\narguably creating a less realistic and thus less instructional\n\nsimulation       of   battle.       Second,      Water   Keeper     contends      that\n\nalternative sites can provide the same training opportunities as\n\nVieques.     While acknowledging that these arguments could have\n\nsome merit, the district court determined on the whole that the\n\nNavy's evidence in support of its contentions was more reliable\n\nand   additionally          cautioned       against      substituting         judicial\n\njudgment for agency judgment in considerations of how and where\n\nthe Navy should train.            The court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin coming to this conclusion.\n\nE. Effect on the Public Interest\n\n      The   effect     of    a    preliminary        injunction     on    the   public\n\ninterest    is    directly        tied    to   its   impact    on   both      military\n\npreparedness and the endangered and threatened species.                         For the\n\nsame reasons laid out above, the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion in finding that the public interest weighed in\n\nfavor of denying a preliminary injunction.                     We also note that\n\n\n                                          -31-\n\fthe two Services charged with protecting the endangered species\n\nhave not objected to the interim exercises or the process used\n\nby the Navy.\n\n                        VI. Conclusion\n\n    For the reasons stated above, we find that Water Keeper's\n\nrequest for preliminary injunctive relief was properly denied.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -32-\n\f",

(\"Water Keeper\"), appeal the denial of their motion for preliminary injunction to stay Department of Navy (the \"Navy,\" one of several defendants-appellees) military exercises on the island of Vieques off Puerto Rico. Water Keeper alleges violations by the Navy of certain procedural requirements under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\"), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536. The district court found that Water Keeper had failed to show a strong likelihood of success on its ESA theory, that its showing of potential irreparable harm had not been strong, and that the balance of harms, as well as the interest of the public, weighed in favor of denying the motion. Since the denial of Water Keeper's motion for a preliminary injunction, the district court has additionally determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the ESA claims because Water Keeper, prior to bringing suit, failed to provide adequate 60-day notice as required by the citizen suit provisions of the ESA. See ESA &#167; 11(g)(2)(A), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1540(g)(2)(A). We hold that notice was adequate for the purposes of the particular ESA claim on appeal here, but affirm on the merits the district court's denial of Water Keeper's motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Statutory Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current appeal takes place against the background of a complex statutory framework that we examine at the outset of our opinion. The ESA directs federal agencies to insure that agency action \"is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species.\" ESA &#167; 7(a)(2), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536(a)(2). This substantive requirement is backed up by a scheme of procedural requirements that set up a consultation process between the agency (in this case the Navy) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (\"NMFS\") and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\") (jointly, the \"Services\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to determine whether endangered species or critical habitat are jeopardized by proposed agency action and whether this adverse impact may be avoided or minimized. See ESA &#167; 7, 16 U.S.C. 1536.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the ESA, \"[e]ach Federal agency shall review its actions at the earliest possible time to determine whether any action may affect listed species or critical habitat.\" 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.14(a). Although the determination of possible effects is ultimately the agency's responsibility, see 51 Fed. Reg. 19949, in making this determination, the agency may consult with the Services through \"informal consultation.\" The term simply describes discussions and correspondence between the Services and the agency designed to assist the agency in determining whether its proposed action is likely to impact listed species or critical habitat. Id. &#167; 402.13. If, at the conclusion of the informal consultation, the Services issue written concurrences that a \"proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat,\" the agency may proceed with the action without further consultation between the parties. Id. &#167; 402.14(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, where the proposed agency action rises to the level of a \"major construction activity\" the determination as to whether agency action may affect listed species or critical habitat cannot be made through informal consultation alone, but must be based on a \"biological assessment.\" Id. &#167; 402.12(b)(1); see also 51 Fed. Reg. 19948 (noting that the biological assessment may be conducted simultaneously with informal consultation or without any informal consultation). A \"major construction activity\" is \"a construction project (or other undertaking having similar physical impacts) which is a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment as referred to in the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)].<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.02. The biological assessment is a study that \"evaluate[s] the potential effects of the action on listed and proposed species . . . and determine[s] whether any such species or habitat are likely to be adversely affected by the action . . . .\" 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.12(a). If, following completion of the biological assessment, the Services issue written concurrences that the \"proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat,\" the consultation is terminated. Id. at &#167; 402.14(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, on the other hand, based on either informal consultation or a biological assessment, the Services are unwilling to concur that the agency action is unlikely to impact protected species and habitat, or if the agency independently concludes that its actions may affect listed species or critical habitat, the agency is required to initiate \"formal consultation.\" See id., &#167; 402.14(a)&amp;(b)(1). Formal consultation is initiated by the written request of the agency describing the action and the manner in which it may affect listed species and critical habitat. Id. &#167; 402.14(c). Significantly, \"formal consultation shall not be initiated by the Federal agency until any required biological assessment has been completed and submitted to the [Services] in accordance with &#167; 402.12.\" Id. &#167; 402.14(c). Nonetheless, formal consultation may take place without a biological assessment if the action is not a major construction activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a period of review and discussion, formal consultation culminates in the Services' issuance of biological opinions advising the agency \"whether the action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat,\" and, if so, whether \"reasonable and prudent alternatives\" exist to allow the agency to comply with the ESA. 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.14(h); see also ESA &#167; 7(b)(3)(A), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536(b)(3)(A). If the Services conclude that the action, or the implementation of any reasonable and prudent alternatives, comply with the ESA, the Services must also issue an \"incidental take statement\" that specifies the amount or extent of the authorized taking of the species. ESA &#167; 7(b)(4), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536(b)(4); 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.14(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the basics of the statutory framework in place, we next consider the application of the ESA to the Navy in relation to its training exercises on Vieques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Navy has used the island for military exercises since 1941, including ship-to-shore and aerial bombing with live ammunition. Thirteen endangered and threatened species live on the island of Vieques and in surrounding water, and, as a result, in 1980 and 1981 respectively, pursuant to the ESA and after formal consultation, the NMFS and the FWS issued biological opinions regarding the effects of Navy exercises on the listed species and critical habitat. Both Services found no jeopardy to any listed species or critical habitat from naval exercises on Vieques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1995, the NMFS and the FWS asked the Navy to reinitiate \"formal consultations\" with the Services to reexamine the effect of the military exercises on the endangered and threatened species of the island. The Services explained that new information regarding the listed species had been obtained since 1981, that dead or injured species had been found after training exercises (the original biological opinion did not authorize any takings pursuant to ESA section 7(b)(4), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536(b)(4)), and that reinitiation was typical after five years. In January 2000, after a period of informal consultation, the Navy agreed to initiate formal consultation with FWS and NMFS. The Navy further indicated its willingness to prepare a biological assessment in anticipation of formal consultation, despite the fact that, in its own determination, it was not required to do so under the regulations. (See 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.12(b)(1); 51 Fed. Reg. 19945, contemplating voluntary preparation of a biological assessment to assist in the determination of whether formal consultation is required.) On January 31, 2000, in the same month that the Navy agreed to reinitiate formal consultation with the Services concerning its use of the Vieques range, the President issued an Executive Order restricting the use of the Vieques training range to no more than 90 days per year and using only non-explosive ordnance. 65 Fed. Reg. 5729 (Feb. 24, 2000). These restrictions were put in place pending a referendum by the citizens of Vieques on the future of Navy exercises on the island.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Navy has clarified that the biological assessment it agreed to prepare would \"address continuing operations of the Vieques Inner Range assuming the referendum regarding the Navy's future use of the Range passes . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Indeed, the Navy completed and submitted this biological assessment to the Services in January 2001 and formal consultation between the parties is currently proceeding. However, the Navy further informed the Services that, pending the completion of formal consultation for long-term use of the range, it would continue to conduct periodic training exercises on Vieques in compliance with the conditions of the Executive Order. The NMFS and the FWS initially agreed to engage in informal consultation with the Navy on an exercise-by-exercise basis for the interim period and issued concurrences of no likely adverse effect for the May and June exercises, thereby exempting the Navy from the requirement to enter formal consultation with regard to these exercises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After June 2000, the FWS changed its position and informed the Navy that it would require \"interim formal consultation\" for all exercises during the interim period of August 2000 to December 2001. The Navy agreed and, on July 12, 2000, provided FWS with a \"consultation package\" covering the planned training exercises through 2001. On July 27, 2000, the FWS issued a biological opinion reviewing the effects of the proposed interim exercises on the endangered and threatened species and finding that the exercises were not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction of critical habitat. FWS issued an incidental take statement with reasonable and prudent measures to ensure that any take would be minimized. Biological Opinion, R. Doc. 12, Ex. 24 (July 27, 2000). For its part, the NMFS continued to evaluate each interim exercise informally on an individual basis and has issued written concurrences for each exercise, finding no likelihood of adverse impact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue on appeal here grows out of the interim formal consultations between the Navy and the FWS concerning the Navy's training activities on Vieques from August 2000 to December 2001. The ESA includes a citizen suit provision \"to enjoin any person, including the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency\" for a violation of the ESA or issued regulations. ESA &#167; 11(g)(1)(A), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1540(g)(1)(A). Invoking standing under the citizen suit provision, Water Keeper argues that the Navy's interim exercises on Vieques constitute a \"major construction activity,\" that the Navy was therefore required to prepare a biological assessment directed at the effects of the interim training exercises, and that, contrary to the Navy's assertions, the July 12th consultation package did not satisfy this requirement. Water Keeper contends that the process by which the Navy received the go-ahead from the FWS to carry out exercises on Vieques from August 2000 to December 2001 was therefore procedurally flawed and the Navy's activities must be enjoined pending compliance with the ESA procedural requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to note that Water Keeper's argument is a narrow one. As discussed above, the Navy has submitted a biological assessment to the Services regarding the long-term use of Vieques for naval exercises and formal consultation is proceeding. Water Keeper is not contesting the legality of the formal consultation addressing the long-term use of Vieques, nor is it contesting the exercise-by-exercise informal consultation between the Navy and the NMFS for the interim use of the island. Water Keeper's sole focus, at least for purposes of this appeal, is alleged procedural violations in the consultations between the Navy and the FWS for exercises from August 2000 to December 2001. Consequently, Water Keeper's request for injunctive relief, if granted, would only stay Navy exercises through December 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Water Keeper's motion for a preliminary injunction. Water Keeper Alliance v. U.S. Dep't of Defense, No. 00-2295, R. Doc. 74 (D.P.R. June 9, 2001) (hereinafter \"Water Keeper I\"). The court assumed that the Navy was required to prepare a biological assessment, but held that the appellees were likely to succeed on the argument that, for the interim exercises, the consultation package met the requirements of the biological assessment. Id. at 5-8. The district court further found that Water Keeper's showing of potential irreparable harm had not been strong. Id. at 12-13. Finally, the court held that the balance of equities favored the defendants, who pointed to concrete national security concerns over the more abstract harm to species asserted by Water Keeper, and that the public interest would consequently be harmed by a grant of preliminary injunctive relief. Id. at 13-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Water Keeper filed a timely appeal challenging the denial of its request for preliminary injunctive relief. We denied Water Keeper's request for a stay of planned exercises pending a decision on the appeal which was expedited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Complicating our review, the district court has since dismissed Water Keeper's ESA claims, apparently essentially the same claims that are on appeal, for lack of adequate notice. The citizen suit provision of the ESA requires sixty days notice of intent to bring suit. ESA &#167; 11(g)(2)(A), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1540(g)(2)(A). The court found that Water Keeper's Notice of Intent to Sue, R. Doc. 55, Ex. A (May 16, 2000) (\"Notice\"), did not include the claims upon which it sought relief. It did so because the Notice did not (indeed could not have, since it predated it) reference the July 2000 biological opinion, which was the culmination of the formal consultation for the interim exercises, as the basis of its grievance. Water Keeper Alliance v. U.S. Dep't of Defense, No. 00-2295, R. Doc. 85 (D.P.R. July 17, 2001) at 15-25 (hereinafter \"Water Keeper II\"). Appellants have filed a motion for reconsideration of the ESA dismissal and, in the alternative, for a certification of interlocutory appeal. That motion is pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly consider the notice question in Section IV and find that notice was adequate as to the ESA claim against the Navy. We then devote the bulk of our discussion, under Section V, to an examination of the motion for a preliminary injunction on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Notice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the certification for interlocutory appeal on the adequacy of notice is still pending, appellees correctly note that we have jurisdiction to consider adequacy of notice as a matter that is intertwined with the issues on appeal. See Xerox Fin. Servs. Life Ins. Co. v. High Plains Ltd. P'ship, 44 F.3d 1033, 1038 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that, because the consideration of the preliminary injunction was \"colorably dependent\" on the denial of defendant's Rule 60(b) motion, this denial was also reviewable on appeal); Alloyd Gen. Co. v. Building Leasing Co., 361 F.2d 359, 363 (1st Cir. 1966) (\"Our jurisdiction embraces a consideration of such questions as are basic to and underlie the order supporting the appeal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously read the 60-day notice requirement in environmental statute citizen suits strictly. See Garcia v. Cecos Int'l, Inc. 761 F.2d 76, 78-82 (1st Cir. 1985) (Resource Conservation and Recovery Act); Massachusetts v. United States Veterans Admin., 541 F.2d 119 (1st Cir. 1976) (Clean Water Act); cf. Maine Audubon Soc'y v. Purslow, 907 F.2d 265 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding that district court did not abuse its discretion when it sanctioned counsel for bringing ESA suit before 60 days after notice of intent to sue had been given). The notice provision provides agencies with an opportunity to resolve the dispute and take any necessary corrective measures before a resort to the courts, Southwest Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 143 F.3d 515, 520 (9th Cir. 1998), and we are not in disagreement with the district court that the notice must adequately inform the agency of the exact grievances against it, if it is to fulfill this purpose. Nevertheless, we find that Water Keeper did in fact provide adequate notice as to the narrow claim at issue here -- the Navy's failure to conduct a biological assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that Water Keeper could not bring an ESA claim against the FWS for alleged deficiencies in the July 2000 biological opinion, without specifically referencing that opinion in its Notice. Water Keeper II at 173-77. However, the court did not consider the adequacy of the notice for purposes of the ESA claim against the Navy. The May 2000 Notice, sent before the Navy and the FWS entered formal consultations for the interim period, admittedly does not notify the Navy that Water Keeper disputes its July 2000 determination to bypass a biological assessment in favor of a consultation package. But the letter does take issue with the fact that the Navy has been conducting military activities on Vieques for some years without the benefit of a biological assessment incorporating new scientific evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> To say that the Navy was not on notice that Water Keeper would object to the failure to prepare a biological assessment for its interim activities, when the Notice makes it clear that Water Keeper intended to challenge an ongoing delinquency in the preparation of a biological assessment, would be setting the bar for adequacy of notice too high. We therefore find that notice was sufficient for purposes of the ESA challenge against the Navy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.

Likelihood of Success</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De novo review of a district court judgment requires that we view the case from the same position as the district court. See Environmental Protection Info. Ctr. v. The Simpson Timber Co. 255 F.3d 1073, 1078 (9th Cir. 2001). The citizen suit provision of the ESA, &#167; 11(g), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1540(g), does not incorporate a standard for judicial review. What standard of review applies depends on the question being asked. Although circuit courts often look to the standard of review set out in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706, those circuits which have considered the issue have adopted standards of review based on the relevant portions of the APA governing what the agency has done (or failed to do). For instance, in Biodiversity Legal Foundation v. Babbitt, 146 F.3d 1249 (10th Cir. 1998), the court applied APA &#167; 706(1) (stating that \"[t]he reviewing court shall -- (1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed\") to review FWS's refusal to make a preliminary finding on a listing decision. See id. at 1252 (stating that \"our review . . . focuses on . . . whether the Service's resulting failure to make a 90-day finding on the . . . petition is agency action unlawfully withheld\"). In other cases, where the court is reviewing, for example, the Forest Service's timber management plan, or the Forest Service's approval of a plan to drill in the wild, the arbitrary or capricious standard of &#167; 706(2)(A) has been applied. See Sierra Club v. Glickman, 67 F.3d 90, 95 (5th Cir. 1995); Cabinet Mountains Wilderness v. Peterson, 685 F.2d 678, 685-86 (D.C. Cir. 1982). In still other cases, such as where a party challenges FWS's refusal to reinitiate consultation, &#167; 706(2)(D) (\"without observance of procedure required by law\") is applied. Environmental Protection Info. Ctr., 255 F.3d at 1078, 1085. Even in cases citing to &#167; 706(2)(A), it may be the \"otherwise not in accordance with law\" clause, rather than the \"arbitrary, capricious\" clause that governs. See id. at 1078.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has little discussion in caselaw on the standard of review of various issues which may arise under the ESA. This case, an expedited preliminary injunction appeal, does not require us to resolve those issues. Even if we were to view Water Keeper's arguments under the most favorable standard of review to them -- essentially as legal issues of statutory construction, and without Chevron<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> deference to the agency -- Water Keeper has not shown probability of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed in Section II supra, the requirement of a biological assessment is triggered if the agency action is a major construction activity. The relationship between a major construction activity, a biological assessment and formal consultation is a complicated one, deserving some more detailed explanation at this point. Formal consultation may not be initiated before a required biological assessment is completed, 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.14(c); that is not to say, however, that a biological assessment is always required for formal consultation to proceed. What triggers the requirement of a biological assessment is that the action is a major construction activity, Id. &#167; 402.12(b), and not that the agency and Services have determined that they must enter formal consultation. Hence, the agency and the Services may conduct formal consultation without a biological assessment if the action in question is not a major construction activity. Conversely, the preparation of a biological assessment does not automatically push the parties into formal consultation, but rather, formal consultation follows only if a biological assessment shows that the action \"may affect listed species or critical habitat.\" See id. &#167; 402.14 (a)&amp;(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Navy and the FWS had reached an understanding, discussed in Section III supra, that they were conducting formal consultations for the interim period of August 2000 to December 2001; indeed the formal consultations concluded in the issuance of a biological opinion and an incidental take statement. The formal consultations were procedurally flawed if they were initiated before \"any required biological assessment had been completed . . .\" (emphasis added). Id. &#167; 402.14(c). Our first point of inquiry therefore is whether the interim activities constituted a \"major construction activity\" triggering the statutory requirement of a biological assessment. Id. &#167; 402.12(b)(1). The district court did not address the first of these questions, but instead appears to have assumed that the interim training activities constituted a major construction activity under 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.12 (b)(1). See Water Keeper I at 159. We believe that the question is more difficult than the district court acknowledges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"major construction activity\" is defined as a project that \"is a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment as referred to in the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332(2)(C)].\" 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.02. NEPA requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement for \"major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332 (2)(C). Appellees argue that, by implication, agency action can constitute a major construction activity, only if it necessitated the preparation of an environmental impact statement. Because no environmental impact statement was prepared for the Navy's interim training activities on Vieques, appellees contend, the training activities from July 2000 to December 2001 do not constitute a \"major construction activity\" requiring a biological assessment. See Hawksbill Sea Turtle v. FEMA, 11 F. Supp. 2d 529, 544 (D.V.I. 1998). Appellees further point to the interim nature of the training activities in question as well as the fact that they are conducted with inert ordnance to argue that they do not rise to the level of an action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Water Keeper counters that the NEPA regulations permit the agency, once a comprehensive environmental impact statement is in place, to rely on smaller-scale environmental assessments for \"an action included within the entire program or policy.\" 40 C.F.R. &#167; 1502.20. Water Keeper points out that the Navy's activities on Vieques were previously determined to be major federal actions subject to an environmental impact statement, see Romero-Barcelo v. Brown, 478 F. Supp. 646, 704 (D.P.R. 1979), aff'd in part, vacated in part on other grounds, 643 F.2d 835 (1st Cir. 1981), rev'd on other grounds, 456 U.S. 305 (1982), and argues that the interim activities have not necessitated the preparation of a new environmental impact statement because they fell into the exception created by the regulations for actions that are part of a larger program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering a request for a preliminary injunction, we need not determine the outcome on the merits \"with absolute assurance.\" Ross-Simons, 102 F.3d at 16; Narragansett Indian Tribe v. Guilbert, 934 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1991). We cannot say that Water Keeper has shown a probability at this stage that the Navy violated the ESA because it concluded that the interim activities -- for which no environmental impact statement had been prepared and which were arguably materially different from previous naval exercises in their short term nature and use of only inert ordnance -- did not constitute a major construction activity necessitating a biological assessment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even assuming that the Navy's activities did necessitate the preparation of a biological assessment, Water Keeper has not shown that the consultation package was not the functional equivalent of a biological assessment. In reaching the same conclusion, the district court focused on the fact that the contents of a biological assessment are discretionary, see 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.12(f), and that the Navy's consultation package contained much of the discretionary content of a biological assessment, including a list of endangered and threatened species, description of the species' habitats, reasons for their decline, action taken to protect the species, results of aerial surveys, and a list of restrictions on military exercises. Water Keeper I at 159.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course the discretionary nature of the contents of the biological assessment should not detract from the fact that it is prepared in fulfillment of section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536(a)(2), see also 50 C.F.R. 402.14(d), and that it consequently must \"use the best scientific and commercial data available.\" We are unable, however, to find that Water Keeper is likely to succeed on the argument that the Navy did not use the best scientific and commercial data available. Water Keeper's contentions to this end essentially boil down to the fact that the Navy did not consult two available studies on brown pelicans, an omission that is not sufficient to find the consultation package inadequate, at least at this preliminary stage. Water Keeper's additional assertion that the Navy could not have possibly relied on the best scientific and commercial data available, given that it had not completed many of the studies that would be incorporated in a future biological assessment for the long-term use of the island, has more analytical appeal. However, the very fact that these studies were not completed means that they were not available at the time of the preparation of the consultation package. We cannot say that the decision by the Navy and the FWS to proceed with the formal consultation on the interim training exercises before the completion of the long term studies violated the ESA's procedural requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore hold that the district court was correct in finding that Water Keeper was unlikely to succeed on the merits. We review the next three prongs in the standard for preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, as discussed above, and accordingly decide them with relative speed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Potential for Irreparable Harm</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, appellants must demonstrate that they will otherwise suffer irreparable harm. The district court found that Water Keeper's showing of irreparable harm was insufficient. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Water Keeper first contends that a procedural violation of the ESA itself constitutes irreparable injury. It is true that the ESA restricts the equity power of the court as to findings of irreparable injury. See Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153 (1978). But Water Keeper's argument is misplaced and ignores context. On the facts of this case, Water Keeper has not shown that the statute entitles it to insist on the procedure of no action taking place until a biological assessment has been filed with the Service. Here, there is a serious question as to whether the Navy was required to prepare a new biological assessment and whether what the Navy submitted was not the functional equivalent of a biological assessment. This context places the case outside of Hill and outside of the reach of Massachusetts v. Watt, 716 F.2d 946 (1st Cir. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, the district court correctly required that Water Keeper show potential for irreparable harm \"apart from the harm that they argue is inherent in a procedural violation of the ESA's consultation requirements . . . .\" Water Keeper I at 161. Furthermore, the court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Water Keeper's assertions concerning irreparable harm stemming from the \"death of even a single member of an endangered species\" were insufficient to justify granting injunctive relief. Id. at 12. In support of its position of irreparable harm, Water Keeper can only point to vague concerns as to long-term damage to the endangered species expressed by FWS and NMFS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> In the absence of a more concrete showing of probable deaths during the interim period and of how these deaths may impact the species, the district court's conclusion that Water Keeper has failed to show potential for irreparable harm was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Balance of Relevant Impositions &amp; Public Interest</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to the claimed danger to endangered species asserted by Water Keeper, the Navy argues that the loss of Vieques as a training ground will adversely affect military preparedness. Water Keeper correctly contends that, by enacting the ESA, Congress has already determined that the \"'balance of hardships and the public interest tips heavily in favor of protected species.'\" Strahan v. Coxe, 127 F.3d 155, 171 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting National Wildlife Fed'n v.  Burlington N. R.R., 23 F.3d 1508, 1510 (9th Cir. 1994)). See also Tennessee Valley Auth., 437 U.S. at 184-185 (finding that the ESA \"reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the 'primary missions' of federal agencies\"). While these precedents direct us to give the endangerment of species, as alleged by Water Keeper, the utmost consideration, we do not think that they can blindly compel our decision in this case because the harm asserted by the Navy implicates national security and therefore deserves greater weight than the economic harm at issue in Strahan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Water Keeper argues in response that military preparedness will not be affected to the extent that appellees allege. Water Keeper first points out that the Navy statements on which the district court relied in determining the harm to national security assumed that the training exercises utilized live ordnance, whereas the Navy was utilizing inert ordinance, arguably creating a less realistic and thus less instructional simulation of battle. Second, Water Keeper contends that alternative sites can provide the same training opportunities as Vieques. While acknowledging that these arguments could have some merit, the district court determined on the whole that the Navy's evidence in support of its contentions was more reliable and additionally cautioned against substituting judicial judgment for agency judgment in considerations of how and where the Navy should train. The court did not abuse its discretion in coming to this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Effect on the Public Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of a preliminary injunction on the public interest is directly tied to its impact on both military preparedness and the endangered and threatened species. For the same reasons laid out above, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the public interest weighed in favor of denying a preliminary injunction. We also note that the two Services charged with protecting the endangered species have not objected to the interim exercises or the process used by the Navy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, we find that Water Keeper's request for preliminary injunctive relief was properly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Under the ESA, the agency consults with the \"Secretary,\" defined as the \"the Secretary of the Interior [to whom the FWS reports] or the Secretary of Commerce [to whom the NMFS reports].\" ESA &#167; 3(15); 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1533(15).

As discussed in Section V infra, courts have found that whether an agency is required to prepare a biological assessment depends on whether it is required to prepare an environmental impact statement under NEPA.

Water Keeper has further argued that the biological opinion issued by the FWS on July 27 was \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A), in part because it was prepared without the benefit of the biological assessment. Water Keeper raised this legal theory in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction and it was considered by the district court (although determined not likely to succeed) as well as briefed by the appellees in this appeal. However, Water Keeper appears to have abandoned this theory, at least for the purposes of its appeal from the denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction, by not briefing the issue. Additionally, Water Keeper's counsel unequivocally stated during oral argument that the only issue on appeal was the claim against the Navy for failure to prepare a biological assessment. We accordingly do not consider the claim against the FWS. See United States v.

(\"Water Keeper\"), appeal the denial of their motion for preliminary injunction to stay Department of Navy (the \"Navy,\" one of several defendants-appellees) military exercises on the island of Vieques off Puerto Rico. Water Keeper alleges violations by the Navy of certain procedural requirements under section 7 of the Endangered Species Act (\"ESA\"), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536. The district court found that Water Keeper had failed to show a strong likelihood of success on its ESA theory, that its showing of potential irreparable harm had not been strong, and that the balance of harms, as well as the interest of the public, weighed in favor of denying the motion. Since the denial of Water Keeper's motion for a preliminary injunction, the district court has additionally determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the ESA claims because Water Keeper, prior to bringing suit, failed to provide adequate 60-day notice as required by the citizen suit provisions of the ESA. See ESA &#167; 11(g)(2)(A), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1540(g)(2)(A). We hold that notice was adequate for the purposes of the particular ESA claim on appeal here, but affirm on the merits the district court's denial of Water Keeper's motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Statutory Framework</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The current appeal takes place against the background of a complex statutory framework that we examine at the outset of our opinion. The ESA directs federal agencies to insure that agency action \"is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of habitat of such species.\" ESA &#167; 7(a)(2), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536(a)(2). This substantive requirement is backed up by a scheme of procedural requirements that set up a consultation process between the agency (in this case the Navy) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (\"NMFS\") and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\"FWS\") (jointly, the \"Services\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> to determine whether endangered species or critical habitat are jeopardized by proposed agency action and whether this adverse impact may be avoided or minimized. See ESA &#167; 7, 16 U.S.C. 1536.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the ESA, \"[e]ach Federal agency shall review its actions at the earliest possible time to determine whether any action may affect listed species or critical habitat.\" 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.14(a). Although the determination of possible effects is ultimately the agency's responsibility, see 51 Fed. Reg. 19949, in making this determination, the agency may consult with the Services through \"informal consultation.\" The term simply describes discussions and correspondence between the Services and the agency designed to assist the agency in determining whether its proposed action is likely to impact listed species or critical habitat. Id. &#167; 402.13. If, at the conclusion of the informal consultation, the Services issue written concurrences that a \"proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat,\" the agency may proceed with the action without further consultation between the parties. Id. &#167; 402.14(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, where the proposed agency action rises to the level of a \"major construction activity\" the determination as to whether agency action may affect listed species or critical habitat cannot be made through informal consultation alone, but must be based on a \"biological assessment.\" Id. &#167; 402.12(b)(1); see also 51 Fed. Reg. 19948 (noting that the biological assessment may be conducted simultaneously with informal consultation or without any informal consultation). A \"major construction activity\" is \"a construction project (or other undertaking having similar physical impacts) which is a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment as referred to in the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)].<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.02. The biological assessment is a study that \"evaluate[s] the potential effects of the action on listed and proposed species . . . and determine[s] whether any such species or habitat are likely to be adversely affected by the action . . . .\" 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.12(a). If, following completion of the biological assessment, the Services issue written concurrences that the \"proposed action is not likely to adversely affect any listed species or critical habitat,\" the consultation is terminated. Id. at &#167; 402.14(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If, on the other hand, based on either informal consultation or a biological assessment, the Services are unwilling to concur that the agency action is unlikely to impact protected species and habitat, or if the agency independently concludes that its actions may affect listed species or critical habitat, the agency is required to initiate \"formal consultation.\" See id., &#167; 402.14(a)&amp;(b)(1). Formal consultation is initiated by the written request of the agency describing the action and the manner in which it may affect listed species and critical habitat. Id. &#167; 402.14(c). Significantly, \"formal consultation shall not be initiated by the Federal agency until any required biological assessment has been completed and submitted to the [Services] in accordance with &#167; 402.12.\" Id. &#167; 402.14(c). Nonetheless, formal consultation may take place without a biological assessment if the action is not a major construction activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a period of review and discussion, formal consultation culminates in the Services' issuance of biological opinions advising the agency \"whether the action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat,\" and, if so, whether \"reasonable and prudent alternatives\" exist to allow the agency to comply with the ESA. 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.14(h); see also ESA &#167; 7(b)(3)(A), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536(b)(3)(A). If the Services conclude that the action, or the implementation of any reasonable and prudent alternatives, comply with the ESA, the Services must also issue an \"incidental take statement\" that specifies the amount or extent of the authorized taking of the species. ESA &#167; 7(b)(4), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536(b)(4); 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.14(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the basics of the statutory framework in place, we next consider the application of the ESA to the Navy in relation to its training exercises on Vieques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Navy has used the island for military exercises since 1941, including ship-to-shore and aerial bombing with live ammunition. Thirteen endangered and threatened species live on the island of Vieques and in surrounding water, and, as a result, in 1980 and 1981 respectively, pursuant to the ESA and after formal consultation, the NMFS and the FWS issued biological opinions regarding the effects of Navy exercises on the listed species and critical habitat. Both Services found no jeopardy to any listed species or critical habitat from naval exercises on Vieques.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning in 1995, the NMFS and the FWS asked the Navy to reinitiate \"formal consultations\" with the Services to reexamine the effect of the military exercises on the endangered and threatened species of the island. The Services explained that new information regarding the listed species had been obtained since 1981, that dead or injured species had been found after training exercises (the original biological opinion did not authorize any takings pursuant to ESA section 7(b)(4), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536(b)(4)), and that reinitiation was typical after five years. In January 2000, after a period of informal consultation, the Navy agreed to initiate formal consultation with FWS and NMFS. The Navy further indicated its willingness to prepare a biological assessment in anticipation of formal consultation, despite the fact that, in its own determination, it was not required to do so under the regulations. (See 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.12(b)(1); 51 Fed. Reg. 19945, contemplating voluntary preparation of a biological assessment to assist in the determination of whether formal consultation is required.) On January 31, 2000, in the same month that the Navy agreed to reinitiate formal consultation with the Services concerning its use of the Vieques range, the President issued an Executive Order restricting the use of the Vieques training range to no more than 90 days per year and using only non-explosive ordnance. 65 Fed. Reg. 5729 (Feb. 24, 2000). These restrictions were put in place pending a referendum by the citizens of Vieques on the future of Navy exercises on the island.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Navy has clarified that the biological assessment it agreed to prepare would \"address continuing operations of the Vieques Inner Range assuming the referendum regarding the Navy's future use of the Range passes . . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Indeed, the Navy completed and submitted this biological assessment to the Services in January 2001 and formal consultation between the parties is currently proceeding. However, the Navy further informed the Services that, pending the completion of formal consultation for long-term use of the range, it would continue to conduct periodic training exercises on Vieques in compliance with the conditions of the Executive Order. The NMFS and the FWS initially agreed to engage in informal consultation with the Navy on an exercise-by-exercise basis for the interim period and issued concurrences of no likely adverse effect for the May and June exercises, thereby exempting the Navy from the requirement to enter formal consultation with regard to these exercises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After June 2000, the FWS changed its position and informed the Navy that it would require \"interim formal consultation\" for all exercises during the interim period of August 2000 to December 2001. The Navy agreed and, on July 12, 2000, provided FWS with a \"consultation package\" covering the planned training exercises through 2001. On July 27, 2000, the FWS issued a biological opinion reviewing the effects of the proposed interim exercises on the endangered and threatened species and finding that the exercises were not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in the destruction of critical habitat. FWS issued an incidental take statement with reasonable and prudent measures to ensure that any take would be minimized. Biological Opinion, R. Doc. 12, Ex. 24 (July 27, 2000). For its part, the NMFS continued to evaluate each interim exercise informally on an individual basis and has issued written concurrences for each exercise, finding no likelihood of adverse impact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue on appeal here grows out of the interim formal consultations between the Navy and the FWS concerning the Navy's training activities on Vieques from August 2000 to December 2001. The ESA includes a citizen suit provision \"to enjoin any person, including the United States and any other governmental instrumentality or agency\" for a violation of the ESA or issued regulations. ESA &#167; 11(g)(1)(A), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1540(g)(1)(A). Invoking standing under the citizen suit provision, Water Keeper argues that the Navy's interim exercises on Vieques constitute a \"major construction activity,\" that the Navy was therefore required to prepare a biological assessment directed at the effects of the interim training exercises, and that, contrary to the Navy's assertions, the July 12th consultation package did not satisfy this requirement. Water Keeper contends that the process by which the Navy received the go-ahead from the FWS to carry out exercises on Vieques from August 2000 to December 2001 was therefore procedurally flawed and the Navy's activities must be enjoined pending compliance with the ESA procedural requirements.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to note that Water Keeper's argument is a narrow one. As discussed above, the Navy has submitted a biological assessment to the Services regarding the long-term use of Vieques for naval exercises and formal consultation is proceeding. Water Keeper is not contesting the legality of the formal consultation addressing the long-term use of Vieques, nor is it contesting the exercise-by-exercise informal consultation between the Navy and the NMFS for the interim use of the island. Water Keeper's sole focus, at least for purposes of this appeal, is alleged procedural violations in the consultations between the Navy and the FWS for exercises from August 2000 to December 2001. Consequently, Water Keeper's request for injunctive relief, if granted, would only stay Navy exercises through December 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. District Court Proceedings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Water Keeper's motion for a preliminary injunction. Water Keeper Alliance v. U.S. Dep't of Defense, No. 00-2295, R. Doc. 74 (D.P.R. June 9, 2001) (hereinafter \"Water Keeper I\"). The court assumed that the Navy was required to prepare a biological assessment, but held that the appellees were likely to succeed on the argument that, for the interim exercises, the consultation package met the requirements of the biological assessment. Id. at 5-8. The district court further found that Water Keeper's showing of potential irreparable harm had not been strong. Id. at 12-13. Finally, the court held that the balance of equities favored the defendants, who pointed to concrete national security concerns over the more abstract harm to species asserted by Water Keeper, and that the public interest would consequently be harmed by a grant of preliminary injunctive relief. Id. at 13-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Water Keeper filed a timely appeal challenging the denial of its request for preliminary injunctive relief. We denied Water Keeper's request for a stay of planned exercises pending a decision on the appeal which was expedited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Complicating our review, the district court has since dismissed Water Keeper's ESA claims, apparently essentially the same claims that are on appeal, for lack of adequate notice. The citizen suit provision of the ESA requires sixty days notice of intent to bring suit. ESA &#167; 11(g)(2)(A), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1540(g)(2)(A). The court found that Water Keeper's Notice of Intent to Sue, R. Doc. 55, Ex. A (May 16, 2000) (\"Notice\"), did not include the claims upon which it sought relief. It did so because the Notice did not (indeed could not have, since it predated it) reference the July 2000 biological opinion, which was the culmination of the formal consultation for the interim exercises, as the basis of its grievance. Water Keeper Alliance v. U.S. Dep't of Defense, No. 00-2295, R. Doc. 85 (D.P.R. July 17, 2001) at 15-25 (hereinafter \"Water Keeper II\"). Appellants have filed a motion for reconsideration of the ESA dismissal and, in the alternative, for a certification of interlocutory appeal. That motion is pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly consider the notice question in Section IV and find that notice was adequate as to the ESA claim against the Navy. We then devote the bulk of our discussion, under Section V, to an examination of the motion for a preliminary injunction on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Notice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the certification for interlocutory appeal on the adequacy of notice is still pending, appellees correctly note that we have jurisdiction to consider adequacy of notice as a matter that is intertwined with the issues on appeal.

The notice provision provides agencies with an opportunity to resolve the dispute and take any necessary corrective measures before a resort to the courts, Southwest Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754202\"><a href=\"/opinion/754202/southwest-center-for-biological-diversity-a-non-profit-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, 520 (9th Cir. 1998), and we are not in disagreement with the district court that the notice must adequately inform the agency of the exact grievances against it, if it is to fulfill this purpose. Nevertheless, we find that Water Keeper did in fact provide adequate notice as to the narrow claim at issue here -- the Navy's failure to conduct a biological assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that Water Keeper could not bring an ESA claim against the FWS for alleged deficiencies in the July 2000 biological opinion, without specifically referencing that opinion in its Notice. Water Keeper II at 173-77. However, the court did not consider the adequacy of the notice for purposes of the ESA claim against the Navy. The May 2000 Notice, sent before the Navy and the FWS entered formal consultations for the interim period, admittedly does not notify the Navy that Water Keeper disputes its July 2000 determination to bypass a biological assessment in favor of a consultation package. But the letter does take issue with the fact that the Navy has been conducting military activities on Vieques for some years without the benefit of a biological assessment incorporating new scientific evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> To say that the Navy was not on notice that Water Keeper would object to the failure to prepare a biological assessment for its interim activities, when the Notice makes it clear that Water Keeper intended to challenge an ongoing delinquency in the preparation of a biological assessment, would be setting the bar for adequacy of notice too high. We therefore find that notice was sufficient for purposes of the ESA challenge against the Navy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V.

The citizen suit provision of the ESA, &#167; 11(g), 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1540(g), does not incorporate a standard for judicial review. What standard of review applies depends on the question being asked. Although circuit courts often look to the standard of review set out in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706, those circuits which have considered the issue have adopted standards of review based on the relevant portions of the APA governing what the agency has done (or failed to do). For instance, in Biodiversity Legal Foundation v. Babbitt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755361\"><a href=\"/opinion/755361/biodiversity-legal-foundation-and-marie-ellen-morrissey-v-bruce-babbitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span> (10th Cir. 1998), the court applied APA &#167; 706(1) (stating that \"[t]he reviewing court shall -- (1) compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed\") to review FWS's refusal to make a preliminary finding on a listing decision. See id. at 1252 (stating that \"our review . . . focuses on . . . whether the Service's resulting failure to make a 90-day finding on the . . . petition is agency action unlawfully withheld\"). In other cases, where the court is reviewing, for example, the Forest Service's timber management plan, or the Forest Service's approval of a plan to drill in the wild, the arbitrary or capricious standard of &#167; 706(2)(A) has been applied. See Sierra Club v. Glickman, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705199\"><a href=\"/opinion/705199/sierra-club-v-dan-glickman-in-his-official-capacity-as-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 95 (5th Cir. 1995); Cabinet Mountains Wilderness v.

Cir. 1982). In still other cases, such as where a party challenges FWS's refusal to reinitiate consultation, &#167; 706(2)(D) (\"without observance of procedure required by law\") is applied. Environmental Protection Info. Ctr., 255 F.3d at 1078, 1085. Even in cases citing to &#167; 706(2)(A), it may be the \"otherwise not in accordance with law\" clause, rather than the \"arbitrary, capricious\" clause that governs. See id. at 1078.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has little discussion in caselaw on the standard of review of various issues which may arise under the ESA. This case, an expedited preliminary injunction appeal, does not require us to resolve those issues. Even if we were to view Water Keeper's arguments under the most favorable standard of review to them -- essentially as legal issues of statutory construction, and without Chevron<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> deference to the agency -- Water Keeper has not shown probability of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed in Section II supra, the requirement of a biological assessment is triggered if the agency action is a major construction activity. The relationship between a major construction activity, a biological assessment and formal consultation is a complicated one, deserving some more detailed explanation at this point. Formal consultation may not be initiated before a required biological assessment is completed, 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.14(c); that is not to say, however, that a biological assessment is always required for formal consultation to proceed. What triggers the requirement of a biological assessment is that the action is a major construction activity, Id. &#167; 402.12(b), and not that the agency and Services have determined that they must enter formal consultation. Hence, the agency and the Services may conduct formal consultation without a biological assessment if the action in question is not a major construction activity. Conversely, the preparation of a biological assessment does not automatically push the parties into formal consultation, but rather, formal consultation follows only if a biological assessment shows that the action \"may affect listed species or critical habitat.\" See id. &#167; 402.14 (a)&amp;(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Navy and the FWS had reached an understanding, discussed in Section III supra, that they were conducting formal consultations for the interim period of August 2000 to December 2001; indeed the formal consultations concluded in the issuance of a biological opinion and an incidental take statement. The formal consultations were procedurally flawed if they were initiated before \"any required biological assessment had been completed . . .\" (emphasis added). Id. &#167; 402.14(c). Our first point of inquiry therefore is whether the interim activities constituted a \"major construction activity\" triggering the statutory requirement of a biological assessment. Id. &#167; 402.12(b)(1). The district court did not address the first of these questions, but instead appears to have assumed that the interim training activities constituted a major construction activity under 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.12 (b)(1). See Water Keeper I at 159. We believe that the question is more difficult than the district court acknowledges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A \"major construction activity\" is defined as a project that \"is a major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment as referred to in the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332(2)(C)].\" 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.02. NEPA requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement for \"major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 4332 (2)(C). Appellees argue that, by implication, agency action can constitute a major construction activity, only if it necessitated the preparation of an environmental impact statement. Because no environmental impact statement was prepared for the Navy's interim training activities on Vieques, appellees contend, the training activities from July 2000 to December 2001 do not constitute a \"major construction activity\" requiring a biological assessment. See Hawksbill Sea Turtle v. FEMA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2289109\"><a href=\"/opinion/2289109/hawksbill-sea-turtle-v-fed-emergency-mgmt/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span>, 544 (D.V.I. 1998). Appellees further point to the interim nature of the training activities in question as well as the fact that they are conducted with inert ordnance to argue that they do not rise to the level of an action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Water Keeper counters that the NEPA regulations permit the agency, once a comprehensive environmental impact statement is in place, to rely on smaller-scale environmental assessments for \"an action included within the entire program or policy.\" 40 C.F.R. &#167; 1502.20. Water Keeper points out that the Navy's activities on Vieques were previously determined to be major federal actions subject to an environmental impact statement, see Romero-Barcelo v. Brown, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1899585\"><a href=\"/opinion/1899585/barcelo-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">478</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We cannot say that Water Keeper has shown a probability at this stage that the Navy violated the ESA because it concluded that the interim activities -- for which no environmental impact statement had been prepared and which were arguably materially different from previous naval exercises in their short term nature and use of only inert ordnance -- did not constitute a major construction activity necessitating a biological assessment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But even assuming that the Navy's activities did necessitate the preparation of a biological assessment, Water Keeper has not shown that the consultation package was not the functional equivalent of a biological assessment. In reaching the same conclusion, the district court focused on the fact that the contents of a biological assessment are discretionary, see 50 C.F.R. &#167; 402.12(f), and that the Navy's consultation package contained much of the discretionary content of a biological assessment, including a list of endangered and threatened species, description of the species' habitats, reasons for their decline, action taken to protect the species, results of aerial surveys, and a list of restrictions on military exercises. Water Keeper I at 159.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course the discretionary nature of the contents of the biological assessment should not detract from the fact that it is prepared in fulfillment of section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, 16 U.S.C. &#167; 1536(a)(2), see also 50 C.F.R. 402.14(d), and that it consequently must \"use the best scientific and commercial data available.\" We are unable, however, to find that Water Keeper is likely to succeed on the argument that the Navy did not use the best scientific and commercial data available. Water Keeper's contentions to this end essentially boil down to the fact that the Navy did not consult two available studies on brown pelicans, an omission that is not sufficient to find the consultation package inadequate, at least at this preliminary stage. Water Keeper's additional assertion that the Navy could not have possibly relied on the best scientific and commercial data available, given that it had not completed many of the studies that would be incorporated in a future biological assessment for the long-term use of the island, has more analytical appeal. However, the very fact that these studies were not completed means that they were not available at the time of the preparation of the consultation package. We cannot say that the decision by the Navy and the FWS to proceed with the formal consultation on the interim training exercises before the completion of the long term studies violated the ESA's procedural requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore hold that the district court was correct in finding that Water Keeper was unlikely to succeed on the merits. We review the next three prongs in the standard for preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, as discussed above, and accordingly decide them with relative speed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Potential for Irreparable Harm</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be entitled to preliminary injunctive relief, appellants must demonstrate that they will otherwise suffer irreparable harm. The district court found that Water Keeper's showing of irreparable harm was insufficient. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Water Keeper first contends that a procedural violation of the ESA itself constitutes irreparable injury. It is true that the ESA restricts the equity power of the court as to findings of irreparable injury. See Tennessee Valley Auth. v. Hill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109897\"><a href=\"/opinion/109897/tva-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">437</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span> (1978). But Water Keeper's argument is misplaced and ignores context. On the facts of this case, Water Keeper has not shown that the statute entitles it to insist on the procedure of no action taking place until a biological assessment has been filed with the Service. Here, there is a serious question as to whether the Navy was required to prepare a new biological assessment and whether what the Navy submitted was not the functional equivalent of a biological assessment. This context places the case outside of Hill and outside of the reach of Massachusetts v. Watt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"424681\"><a href=\"/opinion/424681/commonwealth-of-massachusetts-v-james-g-watt-commonwealth-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">946</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, the district court correctly required that Water Keeper show potential for irreparable harm \"apart from the harm that they argue is inherent in a procedural violation of the ESA's consultation requirements . . . .\" Water Keeper I at 161. Furthermore, the court did not abuse its discretion when it determined that Water Keeper's assertions concerning irreparable harm stemming from the \"death of even a single member of an endangered species\" were insufficient to justify granting injunctive relief. Id. at 12. In support of its position of irreparable harm, Water Keeper can only point to vague concerns as to long-term damage to the endangered species expressed by FWS and NMFS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> In the absence of a more concrete showing of probable deaths during the interim period and of how these deaths may impact the species, the district court's conclusion that Water Keeper has failed to show potential for irreparable harm was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.

Water Keeper correctly contends that, by enacting the ESA, Congress has already determined that the \"'balance of hardships and the public interest tips heavily in favor of protected species.'\" Strahan v. Coxe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747149\"><a href=\"/opinion/747149/richard-max-strahan-v-trudy-coxe-secretary-of-massachusetts-executive/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 171 (1st Cir. 1997) (quoting National Wildlife Fed'n v.

See also Tennessee Valley Auth., 437 U.S. at 184-185 (finding that the ESA \"reveals a conscious decision by Congress to give endangered species priority over the 'primary missions' of federal agencies\"). While these precedents direct us to give the endangerment of species, as alleged by Water Keeper, the utmost consideration, we do not think that they can blindly compel our decision in this case because the harm asserted by the Navy implicates national security and therefore deserves greater weight than the economic harm at issue in Strahan.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Water Keeper argues in response that military preparedness will not be affected to the extent that appellees allege. Water Keeper first points out that the Navy statements on which the district court relied in determining the harm to national security assumed that the training exercises utilized live ordnance, whereas the Navy was utilizing inert ordinance, arguably creating a less realistic and thus less instructional simulation of battle. Second, Water Keeper contends that alternative sites can provide the same training opportunities as Vieques. While acknowledging that these arguments could have some merit, the district court determined on the whole that the Navy's evidence in support of its contentions was more reliable and additionally cautioned against substituting judicial judgment for agency judgment in considerations of how and where the Navy should train. The court did not abuse its discretion in coming to this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Effect on the Public Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The effect of a preliminary injunction on the public interest is directly tied to its impact on both military preparedness and the endangered and threatened species. For the same reasons laid out above, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the public interest weighed in favor of denying a preliminary injunction. We also note that the two Services charged with protecting the endangered species have not objected to the interim exercises or the process used by the Navy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">VI.

Water Keeper has further argued that the biological opinion issued by the FWS on July 27 was \"arbitrary and capricious\" under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A), in part because it was prepared without the benefit of the biological assessment. Water Keeper raised this legal theory in support of its motion for a preliminary injunction and it was considered by the district court (although determined not likely to succeed) as well as briefed by the appellees in this appeal. However, Water Keeper appears to have abandoned this theory, at least for the purposes of its appeal from the denial of the motion for a preliminary injunction, by not briefing the issue.
