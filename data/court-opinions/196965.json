It  is uncontested that SMI's employees  are mostly\r\n\nPuerto  Rican.    According  to  Appellants'  complaint,  Geraci,\r\n\nHackett, Kerr  and Dunne of BMSC were sent to Puerto Rico in 1991\r\n\nand 1992  in connection  with a security  investigation regarding\r\n\nmissing inventory at SMI and the suspected illegal trafficking of\r\n\npharmaceutical   drugs  and   other  products.     According   to\r\n\nAppellants' complaint, Appellees  developed a \"discriminatory and\r\n\npersecutorial  policy\"  against  them  in furtherance  of  BMSC's\r\n\ninterest  in taking  control  of SMI's  management.   Geraci  and\r\n\npossibly others at BMSC contracted with certain named individuals\r\n\nto carry on the security investigation, which included conducting\r\n\na  surveillance of  Appellants  and  their  families,  pressuring\r\n\nAppellants to testify falsely against SMI's management as part of\r\n\nBMSC's  attempt to gain control over SMI, and using illegal means\r\n\nto obtain evidence to be used to dismiss Appellants.   Geraci and\r\n\nDunne   individually   interviewed   SMI   employees,   including\r\n\nAppellants, as part of the ongoing security investigation.  On or\r\n\nabout  the date  of  the individual  interviews, Appellants  were\r\n\ndismissed from their employment at SMI between March and May 1992\r\n\nwithout  being  told  the reason  for  their  dismissal.   It  is\r\n\nuncontested  that no  one else  participated in  these interviews\r\n\nexcept  for a  translator, that  the interviews  took place  in a\r\n\ndiscrete  manner, and  that it  was Appellants  that subsequently\r\n\npublicized the details of the interviews. \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Appellants  raise  four  challenges  to   the  district\r\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment:  (i) discovery  was improperly\r\n\ncut  off;  (ii) their  production  of  documents was  erroneously\r\n\ndenied; (iii)  summary judgment was erroneously  granted on their\r\n\nconspiracy claims;  and  (iv)  summary  judgment  was  improperly\r\n\ngranted  on their  breach of  contract claim.   We  address each.\r\n\nBecause the  first two  involve intertwining facts  and the  same\r\n\nstandard of review, we address them together.\r\n\n           A.  Discovery Cut Off &amp; Document Production\r                     A.  Discovery Cut Off &amp; Document Production\r\n\n          Appellants  raise  two discovery-related  challenges on\r\n\nappeal.   First, invoking Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), Appellants argue\r\n\nthat the district  court erred when  it granted summary  judgment\r\n\nwithout  affording them  the benefit  of conducting  a reasonable\r\n\ndiscovery.   In support thereof, they claim they were diligent in\r\n\ntheir pursuit of discovery  but that Appellees refused  to comply\r\n\nwith  their  requests  and  the district  court  granted  summary\r\n\njudgment without  acting upon their motions  to compel discovery.\r\n\nSecond,  they claim error by the district court's denial of their\r\n\nFebruary 9,  1994, request  for production of  certain documents.\r\n\nAppellees counter,  asserting that the record  clearly shows that\r\n\nthe  district  court granted  Appellants  ample  time to  conduct\r\n\ndiscovery, and  that  they did  not \"hide\"  any information  from\r\n\nAppellants.  Thus, they  contend that the district court  did not\r\n\nabuse its discretion in denying their document production request\r\n\nas untimely.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          It  is  well settled  that  the trial  judge  has broad\r\n\ndiscretion  in ruling  on  pre-trial management  matters, and  we\r\n\nreview  the district court's denial of discovery for abuse of its\r\n\nconsiderable  discretion.  See Fusco  v. General Motors Corp., 11\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  259, 267 (1st Cir.  1994); Serrano-P rez v.  FMC Corp., 985\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  625, 628  (1st  Cir. 1993).    \"We will  intervene in  such\r\n\nmatters only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is,\r\n\nwhere the  lower court's  discovery order was  plainly wrong  and\r\n\nresulted in substantial prejudice to  the aggrieved party.\"  Mack\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

The same abuse of discretion  standard applies\r\n\nto a review of a district  court's denial of a Rule 56(f) motion.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Resolution Trust Corp.  v. North Bridge Assoc., Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n22  F.3d 1198,  1203 (1st  Cir. 1994);  Price v.

We  have also held  that a party\r             \r\n\nmust invoke  Rule 56(f) within  a reasonable  time following  the\r\n\nreceipt of a motion for summary judgment.  Id. at 1204.  \r                                                        \r\n\n          With  this rubric  in  mind, we  find that  Appellants'\r\n\ninvocation of Rule 56(f)  is misplaced for at least  two reasons.\r\n\nFirst,  the record  shows  that Appellants  filed their  original\r\n\nopposition  to summary judgment  without previously informing the\r\n\ncourt of their inability to  properly oppose summary judgment due\r\n\nto  incomplete discovery.   In fact,  Appellants never  sought an\r\n\nadditional  extension  of  the discovery  deadline  before filing\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ntheir  opposition.2   Moreover,  both  Appellants' original3  and\r\n\nsupplemental4 oppositions  to  summary judgment  are  deafeningly\r\n\nsilent  as to their inability  to oppose summary  judgment due to\r\n\nincomplete  discovery.   The first  time Appellants  informed the\r\n\ndistrict  court  about  outstanding  discovery  was  during   the\r\n\nFebruary 4, 1994, and  February 10, 1994,  pre-trial conferences,\r\n\nafter  having  already  filed their  opposition  and supplemental\r\n\nopposition respectively. \r\n\n          Second,  we  are  hard-pressed to  conclude  that  this\r\n\nrecord supports a finding that Appellants exercised due diligence\r\n\nor were  otherwise \"vigilant\" before Appellees  moved for summary\r                                              \r\n\njudgment on January 10, 1994.  After requesting and receiving two\r\n\nextensions,  discovery concluded  on  January 3,  1994 --  almost\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  While they did file  on January 14, 1994, a motion  to clarify\r\nthe  discovery process, they did not mention in that motion their\r\nneed for additional discovery in order to properly oppose summary\r\njudgment.  The district  court denied their motion,  noting their\r\nfailure  to comply  with  the Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure\r\nregarding service and the ample time they had for discovery.\r\n\n3    Appellants'  ten-page  opposition addressed  the  merits  of\r\nAppellees'  arguments  in  favor of  summary  judgment,  attached\r\nvarious depositions  and suggested that, if the  court \"[had] any\r\ndoubt\" about the truth  as revealed by the attached  depositions,\r\nit  could  schedule  a  hearing  or  grant  additional  time  for\r\nAppellants to address in greater detail  each of the \"defendants'\r\noutrageous conclusions.\"   Docket No. 50, p.  9.  The  only basis\r\nadvanced  for not responding to  each of the  arguments was \"time\r\nrestrictions.\" \r\n\n4   While Appellants  do state  in their  supplemental opposition\r\nthat the records finally  received from Appellees are \"incomplete\r\naccording to the depositions  taken to [sic] co-defendants .  . .\r\n[which] are part  of the  record\", Appellants do  not argue  that\r\nthey are unable to oppose summary  judgment because of incomplete\r\ndiscovery; indeed,  they state that  \"although incomplete  . .  .\r\n[these  records]  clearly  reveal  the   discriminatory  animus.\"\r\nDocket No. 51, p. 2. \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\neighteen months after Appellants  filed their complaint on August\r\n\n10, 1992, and almost eight months after the court's May 18, 1993,\r\n\nscheduling  order.    Appellants  did  not  serve  a request  for\r\n\ndocument  production  until November  12,  1994,  after they  had\r\n\nreceived their first extension5  and only two weeks prior  to the\r\n\nend of the new discovery period set for November 30, 1994.  \r\n\n          Furthermore, Appellants failed  to meet with  Appellees\r\n\npursuant  to  Local  Rule  311.11 to  discuss  Appellees'  timely\r\n\nobjections  to  their document  request --  as  set forth  in two\r\n\nletters,  dated November 24, 1993, and December 15, 1993 -- prior\r\n\nto the conclusion  of discovery on  January 3,  1994.  See  Local\r                                                                    \r\n\nRule 311.11.  Pursuant to this Rule, parties are required to meet\r\n\nin a good  faith effort to eliminate disputes regarding discovery\r\n\nprior to filing any discovery-related  motion or objection.   The\r\n\nRule also provides that, unless relieved by agreement or by order\r\n\nof the court upon good cause  shown, counsel must meet within ten\r\n\ndays  of service of a letter requesting a Rule 311.11 conference,\r\n\nand that Appellants  -- as the movants -- bore the responsibility\r\n\nfor arranging  a conference.  See  Local Rule 311.11.   Here, the\r                                           \r\n\nrecord clearly  shows that Appellants  failed to comply  with the\r\n\nRule or carry their burden thereunder.  Not only is it undisputed\r\n\nthat  the parties' Local Rule  311.11 meeting was  not held until\r\n\nFebruary 1, 1994 --  more than two months after  Appellees' first\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  In their first  motion for extension, dated October 11,  1993,\r\nAppellants represented  to the court  that neither party  had yet\r\ncompleted the  interrogatories but  that both parties  had worked\r\ndiligently in the matter. \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ntimely objection and more than one month after Appellees'  second\r\n\nletter  which expressly  invited Appellants'  counsel to  meet on\r\n\nDecember  27,  1993 --  but there  is  absolutely no  evidence of\r\n\ntimely notification to the court or of good cause for the failure\r\n\nto meet earlier or to timely advise the court.  \r\n\n          Moreover,  after  Appellees   filed  their  motion  for\r\n\nsummary judgment,  Appellants never  filed for another  discovery\r\n\nextension prior to filing their opposition to summary judgment on\r                         \r\n\nFebruary 3, 1994.  As noted  above, it was not until the February\r\n\n4 and February 10 pre-trial conferences  that Appellants informed\r\n\nthe district court of Appellees'  failure to produce documents --\r\n\nalmost one  month after the second-extended  discovery period had\r\n\nconcluded and the day after Appellants had filed their opposition\r\n\nto summary judgment. \r\n\n          Attempting nonetheless  to invoke the benefits  of Rule\r\n\n56(f), Appellants argue that  in order to trigger Rule  56(f) the\r\n\nnonmoving  party  need  only  submit   an  equivalent  statement,\r\n\npreferably in  writing, of  their need for  additional discovery.\r\n\nSee, e.g., St. Surin v.

Relying  on these two cases,  they\r                \r\n\ninsist that they triggered Rule 56(f), because \"through the whole\r\n\nprocedure  of the case [they] presented in writing and before the\r\n\ncourt  more than  plausible  basis to  believe that  discoverable\r\n\nmaterials  existed which were  essential to their  case and would\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nraise  truthworthy issues.\"   Appellants' Brief,  p. 24.   Unlike\r\n\nAppellants here, the  parties in those cases  both requested Rule\r\n\n56(f)  extensions after  the  opposing party  filed a  motion for\r                                 \r\n\nsummary judgment, specified that discovery had not concluded, and\r\n\nidentified the  outstanding items  which would be  dispositive to\r\n\nthe issues  raised.  More  importantly, unlike the  instant case,\r\n\nthe  facts in those cases  indicated that the  nonmovants had not\r\n\nbeen dilatory in obtaining discovery.   See St. Surin, 21 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n1315 (concluding that nonmovant should  not suffer from a failure\r\n\nof proof caused by his accommodation of the movant's requests for\r\n\ndelay); Wichita  Falls, 978 F.2d  at 919 (finding  that nonmovant\r                                \r\n\nwas not dilatory because it reasonably awaited outcome of pending\r\n\nnegotiations).     In  any   event,  we  remain   unpersuaded  by\r\n\nAppellants'  list of  the allegedly  numerous times  they brought\r\n\nthis  matter to the court's attention; in fact, their list belies\r\n\nthat they so informed the court.   For example, contrary to their\r\n\nclaim,  Appellants'  two-paragraph request  for  an  extension to\r\n\noppose   summary  judgment  makes   no  reference  whatsoever  to\r\n\ndiscovery matters.  Similarly,  while Appellants claim that their\r\n\nopposition to Appellee's motion for summary judgment \"state[d] to\r\n\nthe Court the situation about the documents and  information that\r\n\ndefendants were refusing to provide,\" Appellants' Brief, p. 23, a\r\n\nreview of their opposition reveals no such statement.  \r\n\n          In  light of  the  two extensions  granted, the  latter\r\n\nstating that this was the final extension, Appellants' failure to\r\n\ncomply with  Local Rule  311.11, and  what  appears to  us as  an\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\noverall lack of due diligence, we find no abuse of discretion  by\r\n\nthe district court.  Contrary to Appellants' assertion, in no way\r\n\ndid the  district court  grant summary judgment  \"without [their]\r\n\nbenefit  to [sic] a reasonable  discovery.\"  Indeed, the district\r\n\ncourt was  never put  in the  position of  granting a  Rule 56(f)\r\n\nmotion  given  that  Appellants  only informed  the  court  about\r\n\nAppellees' failure  to produce discovery after  the conclusion of\r                                                        \r\n\ndiscovery, after Appellants' oppositions  to summary judgment had\r                          \r\n\nbeen filed, and on the eve of the pre-trial stage.\r\n\n          For  obvious   reasons,  we  also  find   no  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion  by the district court when it denied what was clearly\r\n\nAppellants' untimely  motion to  compel document production.   We\r\n\nremind Appellants that Local  Rule 311.11 expressly prohibits the\r\n\ncourt from  entertaining any motion relating  to discovery unless\r\n\nthe  moving party -- here, Appellants -- first advised the court,\r\n\nin  writing, that the parties  have been unable  to resolve their\r\n\ndifferences or  reach an  agreement after counsel  have held  the\r\n\nrequired conference,  or that counsel for  respondent has refused\r\n\nto  confer or  delayed the  conference without  good cause.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nLocal Rule  311.11.  The  first time Appellants  provided written\r\n\nnotification  was  on  February  9,  1994.    The court  informed\r\n\nAppellants  during the  February 10,  1994, pre-trial  conference\r\n\nthat, had they timely filed a written motion to compel, the court\r\n\ncould  have  requested  the  documents  and  made  an  in  camera\r\n\ninspection  of  them  to  assess  the  legitimacy  of  Appellees'\r\n\nobjections.  As the  district court correctly noted in  its order\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ndenying  Appellants'  post-summary  judgment   motion  requesting\r\n\nadditional discovery and a new trial, Appellants waited more than\r\n\none  month  after  the  second extended  discovery  deadline  had\r\n\nelapsed to  properly request  an order  from the district  court.\r\n\nAppellants'  claim that  Appellees  were \"hiding\"  information is\r\n\nessentially irrelevant  against the backdrop of their own lack of\r\n\ndiligence as evidenced by  the lateness of the Local  Rule 311.11\r\n\nmeeting and their untimely  motion to compel document production.\r\n\n          In sum, based on our review  of the record, we find  no\r\n\nabuse  of discretion by the district court with respect to either\r\n\nof Appellants'  claimed errors;  indeed, in light  of Appellants'\r\n\nlack of diligence and failure to follow the rules, we do not even\r\n\nfind   a  hint  of  any  abuse  of  the  district  court's  broad\r\n\ndiscretion.   As we have stated before, \"[s]ticking the appellate\r\n\nnose  too readily  into the  district court's  scope-of-discovery\r\n\ntent  is, we think,  a recipe for  disaster.\"  Mack,  871 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n187.    Where, as  here, the  district  court could  have allowed\r\n\nfurther  discovery, \"it was certainly  free to call  the shot the\r\n\nother  way.\"  Id.  None of Appellants' arguments, including those\r                           \r\n\nnot addressed, persuade us that this record warrants a disruptive\r\n\n\"nosey\" appearance.\r\n\n                       B.

In other  words,\r                                 \r\n\nAppellants  have  failed  to show  what  we  consider  to be  the\r\n\nnecessary link between the  speakers' statements and the decision\r\n\nto  terminate  Appellants'   employment.     Our  conclusion   is\r\n\nparticularly  reinforced by the  uncontested fact that Appellants\r\n\ndid  not mention their race  or national origin  as a factor when\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nasked  why they  thought  their employment  had been  terminated:\r\n\nsome  admitted that  they had  no knowledge  of the  reason while\r\n\nothers offered the non-discriminatory reason that their dismissal\r\n\nwas connected to the ongoing security investigation.8 \r\n\n          For  the foregoing reasons,  we find no  reason on this\r\n\nrecord to consider these  alleged statements to be anything  more\r\n\nthan \"stray remarks\" which fail to  satisfy Appellants' burden of\r\n\nproduction of direct evidence.  We  merely add this:  contrary to\r\n\nwhat seems to drive  Appellants' argument, the mere fact  that it\r\n\nis  possible, indeed  probable,  that there  was some  connection\r\n\nbetween Appellants' dismissal and the security investigation does\r\n\nnot render Appellants' termination ipso facto discriminatory.\r                                                       \r\n\n          Because  we  conclude that  Appellants  have failed  to\r\n\ndemonstrate discriminatory animus by direct evidence, we consider\r\n\nnext whether Appellants  can do  so through a  prima facie  case.\r                                                                    \r\n\nThis analysis is,  for Appellants, painfully  quick:  While  they\r\n\nsatisfy the  first and third  prongs, as  they are  members of  a\r\n\nprotected class  as Puerto Ricans  and they were  all terminated,\r\n\nthey have not proven that they performed their jobs adequately or\r\n\nthat   persons  with   their  qualifications  filled   their  job\r\n\npositions;  indeed, they  do  not even  argue  as much  in  their\r\n\nappellate brief.   In light  of their  failure to  prove a  prima\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  It  is also uncontested that Appellants were  not present when\r\nthe decision to terminate their  employment was made.  We do  not\r\ngive  this  fact  much  weight  considering  that  an  employee's\r\npresence  at that actual moment  is more likely  to be an anomaly\r\nthan the rule. \r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nfacie case, we do not need to proceed further with the  McDonnell\r                                                                           \r\n\nDouglas analysis. \r                 \r\n\n          In light  of Appellants' failure to  carry the ultimate\r\n\nburden of  proving that  Appellees discriminated against  them on\r\n\nthe basis of  their race or national origin, we  affirm the grant\r\n\nof summary judgment,  pausing only  to add this:   The  foregoing\r\n\nand, particularly,  the plethora of allegations  unclothed by any\r\n\nspecific factual record evidence,  suggest to us that Appellants'\r\n\nclaims of  discrimination based on  race and national  origin are\r\n\nbut mere \"unsupported conclusions . .  .

Because  of this\r\n\nfailure to carry their burden of proof as to the falsity of those\r\n\nthree statements, Appellants' defamation claim for both libel and\r\n\nslander  based on  the first  three instances  necessarily fails.\r\n\n                               -24-\r\r\n\nSee Mojica Escobar, 926 F. Supp. at 34 (granting summary judgment\r                            \r\n\nbased on plaintiff's  failure to carry burden  of proving falsity\r\n\nof offending publications).   Based on our review of  the record,\r\n\nAppellants have  utterly failed  to carry their  summary judgment\r\n\nburden  of  presenting  definite,  competent  evidence  to  rebut\r\n\nAppellees' motion  for summary  judgment:   they  have failed  to\r\n\nestablish  the existence  of  a genuine,  material triable  issue\r\n\nregarding the falsity of  the alleged statements.  The  fact that\r\n\nAppellees  do not assert the  truth of the  alleged statements is\r\n\nirrelevant  here  as  Appellants  have  failed  to  establish  an\r\n\nessential element of their claim.  Cf. id.  In light of this,  we\r                                                    \r\n\ndo  not need to address the remaining elements in connection with\r\n\nthe first three instances.\r\n\n          As to the fourth instance, regarding the \"black mafia,\"\r\n\nthe district court correctly dismissed this statement as proof of\r\n\ndefamation  in  light  of  (i)  Appellants'  failure  to  provide\r\n\naffidavits or deposition testimony supporting this allegation and\r\n\n(ii)  the  fact  that,  while Appellant  Serrano  testified  that\r\n\nAppellee Hackett  referred to a \"black mafia,\"  the reference was\r\n\nnot  made in connection to Appellants but, as discussed above, in\r\n\nreference to SMI's management.\r\n\n          Because we  do not  need to address  whether Appellants\r\n\ncarried  their burden  as to  the remaining  elements, we  do not\r\n\naddress their argument challenging  the district court's grant of\r\n\nqualified immunity relating to the interviews in which Appellants\r\n\nwere  questioned.   See Porto  v. Bentley  Puerto Rico,  Inc., 92\r                                                                       \r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\nJ.T.S.  175,  10248  (1992)  (adopting  the  majority  rule  that\r\n\nintracorporate  communication is equivalent  to publication while\r               \r\n\nalso  recognizing qualified immunity).   We only add  this:  Even\r\n\nassuming that Appellants had  submitted evidence that the alleged\r\n\ndefamatory  statements were false,  based upon our  review of the\r\n\nsummary judgment  materials and  Appellants'  arguments we  would\r\n\nnonetheless conclude that their defamation claim fails and, thus,\r\n\nwould affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment.  \r\n\n          Finally, Appellants also allege that the district court\r\n\nerred because there was sufficient evidence of a conspiracy under\r\n\nPuerto Rico law on the part of  Appellees \"to falsely accuse them\r\n\nof being thieves and drug dealers.\"  See 33 L.P.R.A.    4523(2)9;\r                                                  \r\n\nsee  also  People v.  Arreche Holdun,  114  P.R. Dec.  99 (1988).\r                                              \r\n\nAccording to  Appellants, the BMSC officials  named as defendants\r\n\nin the action below came to Puerto Rico \"with the task of framing\r\n\nand fabricating evidence  to dismiss SMI  officials so that  BMSC\r\n\ncould control key  positions.\"  For support, Appellants  point us\r\n\nto their March 28,  1994, motion requesting additional discovery.\r\n\nAs an initial matter, we note that Appellants neither included in\r\n\ntheir  complaint a  cause of  action for  conspiracy nor  did the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9  This section provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\n               If two or more  persons conspire . . .\r\n            (2)  to  falsely  or  maliciously  accuse\r\n            another   person  of  any  crime,  or  to\r\n            attempt  that another  to  be charged  or\r\n            arrested for  any crime;  . . .  shall be\r\n            punished  by imprisonment  . .  . ,  or a\r\n            fine . . . .\r\n\nL.P.R.A.

Possible waiver\r\n\naside,  we decline to consider  their March 28,  1994, motion for\r\n\nthe simple reason that this was not part  of the summary judgment\r\n\nrecord.  What  is more, based  on our own  review of the  summary\r\n\njudgment  materials,  we  find  no  record  evidence  to  support\r\n\nAppellants'  naked assertion that Appellees framed false evidence\r\n\nagainst  Appellants.   While  their  supplemental  opposition  to\r\n\nsummary judgment  includes documents with references  to a \"gang\"\r\n\nand a \"mafia\"  and to the  stealing of inventory  from SMI,  this\r\n\ndoes not prove there was a conspiracy.  We need not consider this\r\n\nargument further. \r\n\n                3.  The Invasion of Privacy Claim\r                          3.  The Invasion of Privacy Claim\r\n\n          Appellants   also  seek  damages  based  on  Appellees'\r\n\nalleged violation of their right to privacy under the Puerto Rico\r\n\nConstitution, claiming  that they were followed,  telephoned, and\r\n\nphotographed without  their permission and put  on an \"industrial\r\n\nblacklist\"  which  has hindered  their  efforts  at securing  new\r\n\nemployment.   A claim for invasion of privacy is actionable under\r\n\nSections 1 and  8 of Article II of the  Puerto Rico Constitution,\r\n\nwhich,  respectively, provide  that \"[t]he  dignity of  the human\r\n\nbeing  is inviolable\" and that  \"[e]very person has  the right to\r\n\nthe  protection  of law  against  abusive attacks  on  his honor,\r\n\nreputation and private  or family life.\"  P.R.

Waiver aside, we nonetheless note that, based\r\n\nupon our independent review of the record, we affirm the district\r\n\ncourt's  grant  of  summary judgment  for  the  very  same reason\r\n\nenunciated by the district court.  \r\n\n              4.  Breach of the Employment Contract\r                        4.  Breach of the Employment Contract\r\n\n          Appellants  argue on  appeal  that  the district  court\r\n\nerred in dismissing their claim that BMSC violated the employment\r\n\ncontract  between SMI  and Appellants  inasmuch as  BMSC did  not\r\n\ncomply  with provisions in the Employee's  Manual when it ordered\r\n\nSMI  to terminate Appellants' employment.   See Santiago v. Kodak\r                                                                           \r\n\nCaribbean,  92  J.T.S. 11,  9164  (1992)  (holding that  employee\r                   \r\n\nmanuals describing  rights and privileges constitute  part of the\r\n\nemployment contract and that  dismissals in violation thereof are\r\n\nunjustified).10  \r\n\n          The  court dismissed  their claim  on the  grounds that\r\n\nAppellants had failed to join an indispensable party, SMI,  whose\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10  Relying on Santiago, Appellants contend  that their dismissal\r                                 \r\nwas  unjustified  because (i)  they did  not  violate any  of the\r\nlisted  violations  and  (ii)  BMSC ordered  their  dismissal  in\r\nviolation of the established procedures.   They also contend that\r\nBMSC violated its \"Involuntary Termination Plan Policy\" according\r\nto which any officer  or employee dismissed up to  December 1992,\r\nas a  result of  the merger  would  be paid  a certain  severance\r\namount. \r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\njoinder  would  destroy  the  court's  diversity  jurisdiction.11\r\n\nAlthough Appellants argued that SMI was not indispensable because\r\n\nSMI officers acted at  the direction of BMSC, the  district court\r\n\nnoted  that their claim was inherently based on the fact that SMI\r\n\nofficers breached the employment contract when terminating  their\r\n\nemployment.  Citing  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 19(b),  it concluded  that,\r\n\nbecause  SMI officers were thus actors in the alleged breach, SMI\r\n\nwas  an indispensable party.  Noting its earlier factual finding,\r\n\nset forth in its decision granting partial summary judgment, that\r\n\nSMI is  a separate  entity from BMSC  and that it  was undisputed\r\n\nthat SMI and  Appellants are  both citizens of  Puerto Rico,  the\r\n\ncourt  concluded that  SMI's  joinder would  result in  the court\r\n\nlacking diversity  jurisdiction.   In reaching its  decision, the\r\n\ndistrict  court also  noted  that Appellants  could always  bring\r\n\ntheir breach of contract claim in the Commonwealth courts.  \r\n\n          Appellants  argue on  appeal  that  the district  court\r\n\nerred in concluding  that there was no diversity  jurisdiction in\r\n\nonly the briefest of manners,  providing only one short paragraph\r\n\nwithout citation to case  law or to  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 19.   Apart\r\n\nfrom reiterating that SMI is  a subsidiary under BMSC's \"complete\r\n\ncontrol\"  and  that  BMSC  is  a  Delaware  corporation with  its\r\n\nprincipal place  of  business  in New  York,  Appellants  do  not\r\n\notherwise challenge or explain the error of  the district court's\r\n\nearlier factual  finding based on the  summary judgment materials\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n11  Having previously dismissed the federal claims,  the district\r\ncourt noted  that its  jurisdiction over the  breach of  contract\r\nclaim was based on the diversity of the parties' citizenship.\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nthat  SMI  is  a separate  company  from BMSC.    In  a similarly\r\n\nsuperficial manner,  Appellants merely reiterate that  SMI is not\r\n\nan indispensable party because the injury and damages were caused\r\n\nby  BMSC,  providing no  adequate  basis for  concluding  why the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred  in concluding  that SMI,  an actor  in the\r\n\nalleged breach, was an indispensable party.\r\n\n          The weakness of Appellants'  arguments here leads us to\r\n\nfind waiver.  See  e.g., McCoy v. Massachusetts Inst.  of Techn.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n950  F.2d  13, 23  (1st Cir.  1991)  (finding waiver  where party\r\n\nfailed to  meet affirmative responsibility of  putting \"best foot\r\n\nforward  in  an effort  to present  some  legal theory  that will\r\n\nsupport [its] claim\"), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 910  (1992); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.

It  is uncontested that SMI's employees  are mostly\r\n\nPuerto  Rican.    According  to  Appellants'  complaint,  Geraci,\r\n\nHackett, Kerr  and Dunne of BMSC were sent to Puerto Rico in 1991\r\n\nand 1992  in connection  with a security  investigation regarding\r\n\nmissing inventory at SMI and the suspected illegal trafficking of\r\n\npharmaceutical   drugs  and   other  products.     According   to\r\n\nAppellants' complaint, Appellees  developed a \"discriminatory and\r\n\npersecutorial  policy\"  against  them  in furtherance  of  BMSC's\r\n\ninterest  in taking  control  of SMI's  management.   Geraci  and\r\n\npossibly others at BMSC contracted with certain named individuals\r\n\nto carry on the security investigation, which included conducting\r\n\na  surveillance of  Appellants  and  their  families,  pressuring\r\n\nAppellants to testify falsely against SMI's management as part of\r\n\nBMSC's  attempt to gain control over SMI, and using illegal means\r\n\nto obtain evidence to be used to dismiss Appellants.   Geraci and\r\n\nDunne   individually   interviewed   SMI   employees,   including\r\n\nAppellants, as part of the ongoing security investigation.  On or\r\n\nabout  the date  of  the individual  interviews, Appellants  were\r\n\ndismissed from their employment at SMI between March and May 1992\r\n\nwithout  being  told  the reason  for  their  dismissal.   It  is\r\n\nuncontested  that no  one else  participated in  these interviews\r\n\nexcept  for a  translator, that  the interviews  took place  in a\r\n\ndiscrete  manner, and  that it  was Appellants  that subsequently\r\n\npublicized the details of the interviews. \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Appellants  raise  four  challenges  to   the  district\r\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment:  (i) discovery  was improperly\r\n\ncut  off;  (ii) their  production  of  documents was  erroneously\r\n\ndenied; (iii)  summary judgment was erroneously  granted on their\r\n\nconspiracy claims;  and  (iv)  summary  judgment  was  improperly\r\n\ngranted  on their  breach of  contract claim.   We  address each.\r\n\nBecause the  first two  involve intertwining facts  and the  same\r\n\nstandard of review, we address them together.\r\n\n           A.  Discovery Cut Off &amp; Document Production\r                     A.  Discovery Cut Off &amp; Document Production\r\n\n          Appellants  raise  two discovery-related  challenges on\r\n\nappeal.   First, invoking Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f), Appellants argue\r\n\nthat the district  court erred when  it granted summary  judgment\r\n\nwithout  affording them  the benefit  of conducting  a reasonable\r\n\ndiscovery.   In support thereof, they claim they were diligent in\r\n\ntheir pursuit of discovery  but that Appellees refused  to comply\r\n\nwith  their  requests  and  the district  court  granted  summary\r\n\njudgment without  acting upon their motions  to compel discovery.\r\n\nSecond,  they claim error by the district court's denial of their\r\n\nFebruary 9,  1994, request  for production of  certain documents.\r\n\nAppellees counter,  asserting that the record  clearly shows that\r\n\nthe  district  court granted  Appellants  ample  time to  conduct\r\n\ndiscovery, and  that  they did  not \"hide\"  any information  from\r\n\nAppellants.  Thus, they  contend that the district court  did not\r\n\nabuse its discretion in denying their document production request\r\n\nas untimely.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          It  is  well settled  that  the trial  judge  has broad\r\n\ndiscretion  in ruling  on  pre-trial management  matters, and  we\r\n\nreview  the district court's denial of discovery for abuse of its\r\n\nconsiderable  discretion.

In  other\r\n            words, Rule 56(f) is designed to minister\r\n            to the vigilant, not to those who slumber\r\n            upon perceptible rights.\r\n\nId.  at 1203 (emphasis  added).  We  have also held  that a party\r             \r\n\nmust invoke  Rule 56(f) within  a reasonable  time following  the\r\n\nreceipt of a motion for summary judgment.  Id. at 1204.  \r                                                        \r\n\n          With  this rubric  in  mind, we  find that  Appellants'\r\n\ninvocation of Rule 56(f)  is misplaced for at least  two reasons.\r\n\nFirst,  the record  shows  that Appellants  filed their  original\r\n\nopposition  to summary judgment  without previously informing the\r\n\ncourt of their inability to  properly oppose summary judgment due\r\n\nto  incomplete discovery.   In fact,  Appellants never  sought an\r\n\nadditional  extension  of  the discovery  deadline  before filing\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\ntheir  opposition.2   Moreover,  both  Appellants' original3  and\r\n\nsupplemental4 oppositions  to  summary judgment  are  deafeningly\r\n\nsilent  as to their inability  to oppose summary  judgment due to\r\n\nincomplete  discovery.   The first  time Appellants  informed the\r\n\ndistrict  court  about  outstanding  discovery  was  during   the\r\n\nFebruary 4, 1994, and  February 10, 1994,  pre-trial conferences,\r\n\nafter  having  already  filed their  opposition  and supplemental\r\n\nopposition respectively. \r\n\n          Second,  we  are  hard-pressed to  conclude  that  this\r\n\nrecord supports a finding that Appellants exercised due diligence\r\n\nor were  otherwise \"vigilant\" before Appellees  moved for summary\r                                              \r\n\njudgment on January 10, 1994.  After requesting and receiving two\r\n\nextensions,  discovery concluded  on  January 3,  1994 --  almost\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  While they did file  on January 14, 1994, a motion  to clarify\r\nthe  discovery process, they did not mention in that motion their\r\nneed for additional discovery in order to properly oppose summary\r\njudgment.  The district  court denied their motion,  noting their\r\nfailure  to comply  with  the Federal  Rules  of Civil  Procedure\r\nregarding service and the ample time they had for discovery.\r\n\n3    Appellants'  ten-page  opposition addressed  the  merits  of\r\nAppellees'  arguments  in  favor of  summary  judgment,  attached\r\nvarious depositions  and suggested that, if the  court \"[had] any\r\ndoubt\" about the truth  as revealed by the attached  depositions,\r\nit  could  schedule  a  hearing  or  grant  additional  time  for\r\nAppellants to address in greater detail  each of the \"defendants'\r\noutrageous conclusions.\"   Docket No. 50, p.  9.  The  only basis\r\nadvanced  for not responding to  each of the  arguments was \"time\r\nrestrictions.\" \r\n\n4   While Appellants  do state  in their  supplemental opposition\r\nthat the records finally  received from Appellees are \"incomplete\r\naccording to the depositions  taken to [sic] co-defendants .  . .\r\n[which] are part  of the  record\", Appellants do  not argue  that\r\nthey are unable to oppose summary  judgment because of incomplete\r\ndiscovery; indeed,  they state that  \"although incomplete  . .  .\r\n[these  records]  clearly  reveal  the   discriminatory  animus.\"\r\nDocket No. 51, p. 2. \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\neighteen months after Appellants  filed their complaint on August\r\n\n10, 1992, and almost eight months after the court's May 18, 1993,\r\n\nscheduling  order.    Appellants  did  not  serve  a request  for\r\n\ndocument  production  until November  12,  1994,  after they  had\r\n\nreceived their first extension5  and only two weeks prior  to the\r\n\nend of the new discovery period set for November 30, 1994.  \r\n\n          Furthermore, Appellants failed  to meet with  Appellees\r\n\npursuant  to  Local  Rule  311.11 to  discuss  Appellees'  timely\r\n\nobjections  to  their document  request --  as  set forth  in two\r\n\nletters,  dated November 24, 1993, and December 15, 1993 -- prior\r\n\nto the conclusion  of discovery on  January 3,  1994.  See  Local\r                                                                    \r\n\nRule 311.11.  Pursuant to this Rule, parties are required to meet\r\n\nin a good  faith effort to eliminate disputes regarding discovery\r\n\nprior to filing any discovery-related  motion or objection.   The\r\n\nRule also provides that, unless relieved by agreement or by order\r\n\nof the court upon good cause  shown, counsel must meet within ten\r\n\ndays  of service of a letter requesting a Rule 311.11 conference,\r\n\nand that Appellants  -- as the movants -- bore the responsibility\r\n\nfor arranging  a conference.  See  Local Rule 311.11.   Here, the\r                                           \r\n\nrecord clearly  shows that Appellants  failed to comply  with the\r\n\nRule or carry their burden thereunder.  Not only is it undisputed\r\n\nthat  the parties' Local Rule  311.11 meeting was  not held until\r\n\nFebruary 1, 1994 --  more than two months after  Appellees' first\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5  In their first  motion for extension, dated October 11,  1993,\r\nAppellants represented  to the court  that neither party  had yet\r\ncompleted the  interrogatories but  that both parties  had worked\r\ndiligently in the matter. \r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\ntimely objection and more than one month after Appellees'  second\r\n\nletter  which expressly  invited Appellants'  counsel to  meet on\r\n\nDecember  27,  1993 --  but there  is  absolutely no  evidence of\r\n\ntimely notification to the court or of good cause for the failure\r\n\nto meet earlier or to timely advise the court.  \r\n\n          Moreover,  after  Appellees   filed  their  motion  for\r\n\nsummary judgment,  Appellants never  filed for another  discovery\r\n\nextension prior to filing their opposition to summary judgment on\r                         \r\n\nFebruary 3, 1994.  As noted  above, it was not until the February\r\n\n4 and February 10 pre-trial conferences  that Appellants informed\r\n\nthe district court of Appellees'  failure to produce documents --\r\n\nalmost one  month after the second-extended  discovery period had\r\n\nconcluded and the day after Appellants had filed their opposition\r\n\nto summary judgment. \r\n\n          Attempting nonetheless  to invoke the benefits  of Rule\r\n\n56(f), Appellants argue that  in order to trigger Rule  56(f) the\r\n\nnonmoving  party  need  only  submit   an  equivalent  statement,\r\n\npreferably in  writing, of  their need for  additional discovery.\r\n\nSee, e.g., St. Surin v.

Relying  on these two cases,  they\r                \r\n\ninsist that they triggered Rule 56(f), because \"through the whole\r\n\nprocedure  of the case [they] presented in writing and before the\r\n\ncourt  more than  plausible  basis to  believe that  discoverable\r\n\nmaterials  existed which were  essential to their  case and would\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nraise  truthworthy issues.\"   Appellants' Brief,  p. 24.   Unlike\r\n\nAppellants here, the  parties in those cases  both requested Rule\r\n\n56(f)  extensions after  the  opposing party  filed a  motion for\r                                 \r\n\nsummary judgment, specified that discovery had not concluded, and\r\n\nidentified the  outstanding items  which would be  dispositive to\r\n\nthe issues  raised.  More  importantly, unlike the  instant case,\r\n\nthe  facts in those cases  indicated that the  nonmovants had not\r\n\nbeen dilatory in obtaining discovery.   See St. Surin, 21 F.3d at\r                                                               \r\n\n1315 (concluding that nonmovant should  not suffer from a failure\r\n\nof proof caused by his accommodation of the movant's requests for\r\n\ndelay); Wichita  Falls, 978 F.2d  at 919 (finding  that nonmovant\r                                \r\n\nwas not dilatory because it reasonably awaited outcome of pending\r\n\nnegotiations).     In  any   event,  we  remain   unpersuaded  by\r\n\nAppellants'  list of  the allegedly  numerous times  they brought\r\n\nthis  matter to the court's attention; in fact, their list belies\r\n\nthat they so informed the court.   For example, contrary to their\r\n\nclaim,  Appellants'  two-paragraph request  for  an  extension to\r\n\noppose   summary  judgment  makes   no  reference  whatsoever  to\r\n\ndiscovery matters.  Similarly,  while Appellants claim that their\r\n\nopposition to Appellee's motion for summary judgment \"state[d] to\r\n\nthe Court the situation about the documents and  information that\r\n\ndefendants were refusing to provide,\" Appellants' Brief, p. 23, a\r\n\nreview of their opposition reveals no such statement.  \r\n\n          In  light of  the  two extensions  granted, the  latter\r\n\nstating that this was the final extension, Appellants' failure to\r\n\ncomply with  Local Rule  311.11, and  what  appears to  us as  an\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\noverall lack of due diligence, we find no abuse of discretion  by\r\n\nthe district court.  Contrary to Appellants' assertion, in no way\r\n\ndid the  district court  grant summary judgment  \"without [their]\r\n\nbenefit  to [sic] a reasonable  discovery.\"  Indeed, the district\r\n\ncourt was  never put  in the  position of  granting a  Rule 56(f)\r\n\nmotion  given  that  Appellants  only informed  the  court  about\r\n\nAppellees' failure  to produce discovery after  the conclusion of\r                                                        \r\n\ndiscovery, after Appellants' oppositions  to summary judgment had\r                          \r\n\nbeen filed, and on the eve of the pre-trial stage.\r\n\n          For  obvious   reasons,  we  also  find   no  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion  by the district court when it denied what was clearly\r\n\nAppellants' untimely  motion to  compel document production.   We\r\n\nremind Appellants that Local  Rule 311.11 expressly prohibits the\r\n\ncourt from  entertaining any motion relating  to discovery unless\r\n\nthe  moving party -- here, Appellants -- first advised the court,\r\n\nin  writing, that the parties  have been unable  to resolve their\r\n\ndifferences or  reach an  agreement after counsel  have held  the\r\n\nrequired conference,  or that counsel for  respondent has refused\r\n\nto  confer or  delayed the  conference without  good cause.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nLocal Rule  311.11.  The  first time Appellants  provided written\r\n\nnotification  was  on  February  9,  1994.    The court  informed\r\n\nAppellants  during the  February 10,  1994, pre-trial  conference\r\n\nthat, had they timely filed a written motion to compel, the court\r\n\ncould  have  requested  the  documents  and  made  an  in  camera\r\n\ninspection  of  them  to  assess  the  legitimacy  of  Appellees'\r\n\nobjections.  As the  district court correctly noted in  its order\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\ndenying  Appellants'  post-summary  judgment   motion  requesting\r\n\nadditional discovery and a new trial, Appellants waited more than\r\n\none  month  after  the  second extended  discovery  deadline  had\r\n\nelapsed to  properly request  an order  from the district  court.\r\n\nAppellants'  claim that  Appellees  were \"hiding\"  information is\r\n\nessentially irrelevant  against the backdrop of their own lack of\r\n\ndiligence as evidenced by  the lateness of the Local  Rule 311.11\r\n\nmeeting and their untimely  motion to compel document production.\r\n\n          In sum, based on our review  of the record, we find  no\r\n\nabuse  of discretion by the district court with respect to either\r\n\nof Appellants'  claimed errors;  indeed, in light  of Appellants'\r\n\nlack of diligence and failure to follow the rules, we do not even\r\n\nfind   a  hint  of  any  abuse  of  the  district  court's  broad\r\n\ndiscretion.   As we have stated before, \"[s]ticking the appellate\r\n\nnose  too readily  into the  district court's  scope-of-discovery\r\n\ntent  is, we think,  a recipe for  disaster.\"  Mack,  871 F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n187.

The first remark\r\n\npointed to was allegedly made by Hackett, in which he stated that\r\n\nthe company had  a \"black mafia  [which was] getting rich  at the\r\n\nexpense  of the company.\"   Deposition of Serrano,  p. 125, lines\r\n\n21-23.

The very  few\r\n\nreferences to  \"black mafia\"  pointed to  by Appellants  in their\r\n\nopposition  to  summary  judgment  suggest   that  \"black  mafia\"\r\n\nreferred to,  as Appellant  Serrano testified in  his deposition,\r\n\nmembers of SMI's management \"who were getting rich at the expense\r\n\nof the company, at [BMSC's] expense\"; indeed, Serrano's testimony\r\n\nthat the \"['black mafia'] was made up by  all the managers\" seems\r\n\nto undercut  Appellants' claim  that Appellees were  referring to\r\n\nthem as members  of a \"black  mafia.\"  Id.  at 125, lines  23-24.\r                                                    \r\n\nBased  on the record,  we are hard-pressed  to conclude Appellees\r\n\nwere referring  to Appellants with a  discriminatory animus based\r\n\non their race or national origin. \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7  In this regard, we note that use of the adjective \"black\" does\r\nnot necessarily refer to skin color.   It has been widely used to\r\ndescribe,  among  other  things,  sinister  or  evil  actions  or\r\ncharacters.  See  Merriam Webster's Collegiate  Dictionary, Tenth\r                                                                    \r\nEd.,  pp.  118-20 (1993).   \"Mafia\"  is  defined as  a particular\r\n\"criminal  organization\" or  \"a group  of people  likened to  the\r\nMafia,\"  id.  at 699.    Taken together,  \"black\"  could arguably\r                      \r\ndescribe the collective skin color of the members of the criminal\r\norganization  or  the  group's  illegal,  illicit  or clandestine\r\nactivities in a similar vein to \"black market.\"\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\n          While  we could end the inquiry here, we note that even\r\n\nassuming that the  term \"black mafia\" was  racially or ethnically\r\n\ncharged, neither of these statements  constitutes direct evidence\r\n\nof discrimination.    While  the close  time  frame  between  the\r\n\ninterviews and the dismissals is  suspicious, see Smith, 76  F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat  423 (noting  temporal  proximity as  a  factor); id.  at  432\r                                                                  \r\n\n(citing  cases),  Appellants  have  not demonstrated  --  as  the\r\n\ndistrict  court noted  -- that  they  were terminated  because of\r\n\ntheir  race  or  national  origin   or  that  the  speakers  were\r\n\ndecisionmakers  who  made the  comments  in  connection with  the\r\n\ndecisional process.  Indeed, Hackett  and Geraci are employees of\r\n\nBMSC,  not  SMI,  and  it  is  uncontested  that Appellants  were\r\n\nemployees of SMI at the time of their dismissals.\r\n\n          Even assuming, as Appellants  allege, that Hackett  and\r\n\nGeraci  ordered  SMI's  Human  Resources  Director  to  terminate\r\n\nAppellants'  employment does  not assist  Appellants, because  of\r\n\ntheir  failure  to  provide  specific factual  support  that  the\r\n\nalleged  remarks  were made  in  connection  with the  employment\r\n\ndecisional   process.     Resting   on   conclusory  allegations,\r\n\nimprobable  inferences  and  unsupported  speculation   does  not\r\n\nsuffice.    See Goldman,  985  F.2d  at 1116.    In other  words,\r                                 \r\n\nAppellants  have  failed  to show  what  we  consider  to be  the\r\n\nnecessary link between the  speakers' statements and the decision\r\n\nto  terminate  Appellants'   employment.     Our  conclusion   is\r\n\nparticularly  reinforced by the  uncontested fact that Appellants\r\n\ndid  not mention their race  or national origin  as a factor when\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nasked  why they  thought  their employment  had been  terminated:\r\n\nsome  admitted that  they had  no knowledge  of the  reason while\r\n\nothers offered the non-discriminatory reason that their dismissal\r\n\nwas connected to the ongoing security investigation.8 \r\n\n          For  the foregoing reasons,  we find no  reason on this\r\n\nrecord to consider these  alleged statements to be anything  more\r\n\nthan \"stray remarks\" which fail to  satisfy Appellants' burden of\r\n\nproduction of direct evidence.  We  merely add this:  contrary to\r\n\nwhat seems to drive  Appellants' argument, the mere fact  that it\r\n\nis  possible, indeed  probable,  that there  was some  connection\r\n\nbetween Appellants' dismissal and the security investigation does\r\n\nnot render Appellants' termination ipso facto discriminatory.\r                                                       \r\n\n          Because  we  conclude that  Appellants  have failed  to\r\n\ndemonstrate discriminatory animus by direct evidence, we consider\r\n\nnext whether Appellants  can do  so through a  prima facie  case.\r                                                                    \r\n\nThis analysis is,  for Appellants, painfully  quick:  While  they\r\n\nsatisfy the  first and third  prongs, as  they are  members of  a\r\n\nprotected class  as Puerto Ricans  and they were  all terminated,\r\n\nthey have not proven that they performed their jobs adequately or\r\n\nthat   persons  with   their  qualifications  filled   their  job\r\n\npositions;  indeed, they  do  not even  argue  as much  in  their\r\n\nappellate brief.   In light  of their  failure to  prove a  prima\r                                                                           \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n8  It  is also uncontested that Appellants were  not present when\r\nthe decision to terminate their  employment was made.  We do  not\r\ngive  this  fact  much  weight  considering  that  an  employee's\r\npresence  at that actual moment  is more likely  to be an anomaly\r\nthan the rule. \r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nfacie case, we do not need to proceed further with the  McDonnell\r                                                                           \r\n\nDouglas analysis. \r                 \r\n\n          In light  of Appellants' failure to  carry the ultimate\r\n\nburden of  proving that  Appellees discriminated against  them on\r\n\nthe basis of  their race or national origin, we  affirm the grant\r\n\nof summary judgment,  pausing only  to add this:   The  foregoing\r\n\nand, particularly,  the plethora of allegations  unclothed by any\r\n\nspecific factual record evidence,  suggest to us that Appellants'\r\n\nclaims of  discrimination based on  race and national  origin are\r\n\nbut mere \"unsupported conclusions . .  .

The  fact that\r\n\nAppellees  do not assert the  truth of the  alleged statements is\r\n\nirrelevant  here  as  Appellants  have  failed  to  establish  an\r\n\nessential element of their claim.

T.33   4523(2).\r\n\n                               -26-\r\r\n\ndistrict court  explicitly address  conspiracy.   Possible waiver\r\n\naside,  we decline to consider  their March 28,  1994, motion for\r\n\nthe simple reason that this was not part  of the summary judgment\r\n\nrecord.  What  is more, based  on our own  review of the  summary\r\n\njudgment  materials,  we  find  no  record  evidence  to  support\r\n\nAppellants'  naked assertion that Appellees framed false evidence\r\n\nagainst  Appellants.   While  their  supplemental  opposition  to\r\n\nsummary judgment  includes documents with references  to a \"gang\"\r\n\nand a \"mafia\"  and to the  stealing of inventory  from SMI,  this\r\n\ndoes not prove there was a conspiracy.  We need not consider this\r\n\nargument further. \r\n\n                3.  The Invasion of Privacy Claim\r                          3.  The Invasion of Privacy Claim\r\n\n          Appellants   also  seek  damages  based  on  Appellees'\r\n\nalleged violation of their right to privacy under the Puerto Rico\r\n\nConstitution, claiming  that they were followed,  telephoned, and\r\n\nphotographed without  their permission and put  on an \"industrial\r\n\nblacklist\"  which  has hindered  their  efforts  at securing  new\r\n\nemployment.   A claim for invasion of privacy is actionable under\r\n\nSections 1 and  8 of Article II of the  Puerto Rico Constitution,\r\n\nwhich,  respectively, provide  that \"[t]he  dignity of  the human\r\n\nbeing  is inviolable\" and that  \"[e]very person has  the right to\r\n\nthe  protection  of law  against  abusive attacks  on  his honor,\r\n\nreputation and private  or family life.\"  P.R.

The district\r                              \r\n\n                               -27-\r\r\n\ncourt  granted  summary  judgment  on the  basis  of  Appellants'\r\n\nfailure to provide  any evidence that their  privacy was invaded.\r\n\nAppellants  do not explicitly appeal this  aspect of the district\r\n\ncourt's decision.   Waiver aside, we nonetheless note that, based\r\n\nupon our independent review of the record, we affirm the district\r\n\ncourt's  grant  of  summary judgment  for  the  very  same reason\r\n\nenunciated by the district court.  \r\n\n              4.  Breach of the Employment Contract\r                        4.  Breach of the Employment Contract\r\n\n          Appellants  argue on  appeal  that  the district  court\r\n\nerred in dismissing their claim that BMSC violated the employment\r\n\ncontract  between SMI  and Appellants  inasmuch as  BMSC did  not\r\n\ncomply  with provisions in the Employee's  Manual when it ordered\r\n\nSMI  to terminate Appellants' employment.   See Santiago v. Kodak\r                                                                           \r\n\nCaribbean,  92  J.T.S. 11,  9164  (1992)  (holding that  employee\r                   \r\n\nmanuals describing  rights and privileges constitute  part of the\r\n\nemployment contract and that  dismissals in violation thereof are\r\n\nunjustified).10  \r\n\n          The  court dismissed  their claim  on the  grounds that\r\n\nAppellants had failed to join an indispensable party, SMI,  whose\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10  Relying on Santiago, Appellants contend  that their dismissal\r                                 \r\nwas  unjustified  because (i)  they did  not  violate any  of the\r\nlisted  violations  and  (ii)  BMSC ordered  their  dismissal  in\r\nviolation of the established procedures.   They also contend that\r\nBMSC violated its \"Involuntary Termination Plan Policy\" according\r\nto which any officer  or employee dismissed up to  December 1992,\r\nas a  result of  the merger  would  be paid  a certain  severance\r\namount. \r\n\n                               -28-\r\r\n\njoinder  would  destroy  the  court's  diversity  jurisdiction.11\r\n\nAlthough Appellants argued that SMI was not indispensable because\r\n\nSMI officers acted at  the direction of BMSC, the  district court\r\n\nnoted  that their claim was inherently based on the fact that SMI\r\n\nofficers breached the employment contract when terminating  their\r\n\nemployment.  Citing  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 19(b),  it concluded  that,\r\n\nbecause  SMI officers were thus actors in the alleged breach, SMI\r\n\nwas  an indispensable party.  Noting its earlier factual finding,\r\n\nset forth in its decision granting partial summary judgment, that\r\n\nSMI is  a separate  entity from BMSC  and that it  was undisputed\r\n\nthat SMI and  Appellants are  both citizens of  Puerto Rico,  the\r\n\ncourt  concluded that  SMI's  joinder would  result in  the court\r\n\nlacking diversity  jurisdiction.   In reaching its  decision, the\r\n\ndistrict  court also  noted  that Appellants  could always  bring\r\n\ntheir breach of contract claim in the Commonwealth courts.  \r\n\n          Appellants  argue on  appeal  that  the district  court\r\n\nerred in concluding  that there was no diversity  jurisdiction in\r\n\nonly the briefest of manners,  providing only one short paragraph\r\n\nwithout citation to case  law or to  Fed. R. Civ.  P. 19.   Apart\r\n\nfrom reiterating that SMI is  a subsidiary under BMSC's \"complete\r\n\ncontrol\"  and  that  BMSC  is  a  Delaware  corporation with  its\r\n\nprincipal place  of  business  in New  York,  Appellants  do  not\r\n\notherwise challenge or explain the error of  the district court's\r\n\nearlier factual  finding based on the  summary judgment materials\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n11  Having previously dismissed the federal claims,  the district\r\ncourt noted  that its  jurisdiction over the  breach of  contract\r\nclaim was based on the diversity of the parties' citizenship.\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nthat  SMI  is  a separate  company  from BMSC.    In  a similarly\r\n\nsuperficial manner,  Appellants merely reiterate that  SMI is not\r\n\nan indispensable party because the injury and damages were caused\r\n\nby  BMSC,  providing no  adequate  basis for  concluding  why the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred  in concluding  that SMI,  an actor  in the\r\n\nalleged breach, was an indispensable party.\r\n\n          The weakness of Appellants'  arguments here leads us to\r\n\nfind waiver.

Massachusetts Inst.  of Techn.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572652\"><a href=\"/opinion/572652/james-l-mccoy-administrator-of-the-electrical-workers-trust-funds-etc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23  (1st Cir.  1991)  (finding waiver  where party\r\n\nfailed to  meet affirmative responsibility of  putting \"best foot\r\n\nforward  in  an effort  to present  some  legal theory  that will\r\n\nsupport [its] claim\"), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1992); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.

Indeed,  in  light  of\r                       \r\n\nAppellants'  failure to  even mention  Rule  19, let  alone claim\r\n\nerror thereunder, we see no  reason why we should embark  on Rule\r\n\n19's indispensable  party analysis,  see  Fed.

In light\r\n\nof this and the two  undisputed facts that SMI (i) is  a separate\r\n\nlegal entity from BMSC  and (ii) was Appellants' employer  at the\r\n\ntime of their  dismissal, we conclude  that Appellants' cause  of\r\n\naction for severance pay could not be brought against BMSC as any\r\n\nclaim arising  under the employment  contract between  Appellants\r\n\nand SMI should have been brought against SMI.
