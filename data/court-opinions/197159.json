Indeed,  one of\r\n\nthe  most illustrious  of the  Framers regarded  great  cities as\r\n\n\"pestilential to the morals, the  health, [and] the liberties  of\r\n\nman.\"   Christopher Tunnard, The  City of Man  34 (1970) (quoting\r                                                       \r\n\nThomas Jefferson).\r\n\n          In this  vein, American  legal institutions  have begun\r\n\nover time  to view cities  with a certain  constitutionally based\r\n\nsuspicion.   Thus,  in Monell  v. New  York City Dep't  of Social\r                                                                           \r\n\nServs.,  436 U.S. 658, 691  (1978), the Supreme  Court ruled that\r                \r\n\nmunicipalities  could be held liable  under 42 U.S.C.    1983 for\r\n\ndeprivations  of  federally   protected  rights  which   occurred\r\n\n\"pursuant to official municipal policy of some  nature.\"1  Monell\r                                                                           \r\n\nopened  the floodgates  for an  outpouring of such  suits against\r\n\nmunicipalities.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The statute provides:\r\n\n          Every person who, under color of any statute,\r\n          ordinance, regulation, custom,  or usage,  of\r\n          any State  . . .,  subjects, or causes  to be\r\n          subjected, any citizen  of the United  States\r\n          or  other  person  within   the  jurisdiction\r\n          thereof to  the  deprivation of  any  rights,\r\n          privileges,  or  immunities  secured  by  the\r\n          Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the\r\n          party injured  in an  action at law,  suit in\r\n          equity,  or  other   proper  proceeding   for\r\n          redress.\r\n\n42 U.S.C.    1983 (1994).   The upshot of the  Monell decision is\r                                                               \r\nthat a municipality is  a \"person\" for purposes of  section 1983,\r\nand, hence, amenable to suit for violations thereof.  See Monell,\r                                                                          \r\n436 U.S. at 690.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\n          The  case at  hand is  one  example of  the genre.   At\r\n\ntrial,  a jury found  the City of  Fall River (the  City) and two\r\n\nmunicipal officials liable under section 1983 for the  passage of\r\n\na facially neutral ordinance  that abolished the plaintiff's job.\r\n\nThe  defendants'  appeals  raise  a  tantalizing  question  about\r\n\nwhether  a  discriminatory animus  displayed  by  fewer than  the\r\n\nminimum  number  of city  council  members whose  votes  would be\r\n\nrequired to enact an ordinance can  (or should) be imputed to the\r\n\nmunicipality  itself.     Other  interesting   questions  abound,\r\n\nincluding  questions dealing  with  causation in  the context  of\r\n\nconstitutional torts and the availability of legislative immunity\r\n\ndefenses in that setting.  Before addressing any of these issues,\r\n\nhowever, we must  parse Fed. R.  App. P. 4  (a)(6) for the  first\r\n\ntime  and determine  whether  the defendants  have brought  their\r\n\nappeals in a timeous fashion.\r\n\nI.  A TALE OF ONE CITY\r          I.  A TALE OF ONE CITY\r\n\n          Many  of the  facts in  this case  are conflicted.   We\r\n\npresent them as best they have presented themselves, occasionally\r\n\nresolving disparities  as the  jury permissibly might  have done.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  Veranda Beach Club  Ltd. Partnership v.  Western Sur.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo., 936 F.2d 1364, 1375 (1st Cir. 1991) (discussing standard for\r             \r\n\nappellate   review  of  post-verdict  challenges  to  evidentiary\r\n\nsufficiency).\r\n\n          The City hired  the plaintiff,  Janet Scott-Harris,  as\r\n\nthe administrator of the  newly created Department of  Health and\r\n\nHuman  Services  (HHS).   When  Scott-Harris  entered the  City's\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nservice in 1987,  she became the  first African-American ever  to\r\n\nhold a managerial position  in the municipal government.   By all\r\n\naccounts  she performed quite  well at HHS.   Withal, she did not\r\n\nenjoy  a  problem-free  relationship  with  the City's  political\r\n\nhierarchs.    In  1988,  for example,  she  clashed  with Marilyn\r\n\nRoderick, the  vice-president of the City  Council.  Scott-Harris\r\n\nbelieved  that  Roderick  made  inappropriate  references  to  an\r\n\naspirant's ethnicity in the course of an employment interview and\r\n\nstormed out of  the room.   Shortly thereafter, she engaged  in a\r\n\nshouting  match  with Roderick.   When  Scott-Harris subsequently\r\n\nattempted to apologize, Roderick hung up the telephone.\r\n\n          Scott-Harris'  difficulties with  Roderick did  not end\r\n\nwith the aforedescribed incident.   There were periodic flare-ups\r\n\n   by way of  illustration, Roderick wrote  a letter  to the City\r\n\nAdministrator, Robert Connors, protesting  Scott-Harris' use of a\r\n\nCity-owned motor vehicle    but it was Scott-Harris'  reaction to\r\n\nthe dysphemisms spouted by  Dorothy (Dot) Biltcliffe, a nutrition\r\n\nprogram assistant  for the  City's Council  on Aging  (COA), that\r\n\nprecipitated internecine warfare.   In the  fall of 1990,  Scott-\r\n\nHarris  learned  that   Biltcliffe  had  been   making  offensive\r\n\ncomments.   In  one  instance, referring  to her  co-worker Paula\r\n\nGousie and  to Scott-Harris,  Biltcliffe remarked:   \"That little\r\n\nFrench  bitch has her  head up that  nigger's ass.\"   In another,\r\n\nBiltcliffe  referred to  a secretary  as \"a little  black bitch.\"\r\n\nScott-Harris spoke out against this racist invective and, because\r\n\nCOA operated  under her  general supervision, she  consulted with\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nConnors and then drew up a set of charges against Biltcliffe as a\r\n\nprelude to dismissal.\r\n\n          The  pendency  of   these  charges   did  not   improve\r\n\nBiltcliffe's manners;  she  called Scott-Harris  \"a black  nigger\r\n\nbitch\"  and  warned that  there  would  be repercussions  because\r\n\nBiltcliffe \"knew  people.\"   Biltcliffe  unabashedly pressed  her\r\n\ncase with two city councilors (Roderick and Raymond Mitchell) and\r\n\na  state senator who, in  turn, called Roderick.   After numerous\r\n\npostponements the City  held a hearing  on March 27, 1991.   This\r\n\nresulted in a settlement under which Biltcliffe agreed to  accept\r\n\na 60-day suspension without pay.  Mayor Daniel Bogan subsequently\r\n\nintervened and pared the punishment substantially.\r\n\n          During this  time frame  the  City's financial  outlook\r\n\nworsened.   Municipal officials anticipated that  state aid would\r\n\ndecline up to 10%  in the next fiscal year (July 1,  1991 to June\r\n\n30, 1992).   Mayor Bogan  directed Connors  to prepare a  list of\r\n\nproposed budget cuts to  accommodate the anticipated reduction in\r\n\nfunding.   Connors asked  his department heads,  including Scott-\r\n\nHarris, for  their input.  Scott-Harris  recommended reducing the\r\n\nhours of school nurses.  Bogan rejected this suggestion and, over\r\n\nConnors'  objection,  insisted  that  Scott-Harris'  position  be\r\n\neliminated.\r\n\n          Because  the   post  had  been  created   by  municipal\r\n\nordinance,  its   abolition  necessitated  the   same  procedural\r\n\nformalities.  The City  Charter requires the votes of  a majority\r\n\nof the  nine members of the  City Council for passage  of such an\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nordinance.   The mayor often submits proposed  legislation to the\r\n\nCity Council,  and, in  addition, he  must approve  every enacted\r\n\nordinance  (or  else the  Council must  override  his veto).   In\r\n\nFebruary  1991 Bogan  asked the  Council to  do away  with Scott-\r\n\nHarris' position.  On March 5 the ordinance committee, chaired by\r\n\nRoderick,  reported  out  an  emendatory  ordinance  designed  to\r\n\nachieve  this end and recommended its passage.  Three weeks later\r\n\nthe  City  Council voted  six-to-two  (Roderick  voting with  the\r\n\nmajority) to  approve the position-elimination ordinance.   Bogan\r\n\nsigned it into law.\r\n\n          At  about the  same time  that he  moved to  incinerate\r\n\nScott-Harris'  job, Bogan  offered  her a  different portfolio   \r\n\nPublic Health  Director    which paid approximately  $12,000 less\r\n\nper annum.    Scott-Harris accepted  the  offer by  letter  dated\r\n\nFebruary 28,  1991, but a  follow-up communiqu  from  Bogan added\r\n\nextra duties and shifted Scott-Harris to a less desirable office.\r\n\nDisappointed,  Scott-Harris  drafted a  letter rejecting  the job\r\n\noffer.   That letter mysteriously  arrived at the  mayor's office\r\n\nand was  acted upon  by  Bogan despite  Scott-Harris' efforts  to\r\n\nretract it.   Scott-Harris' tour of  duty with the City  ended on\r\n\nMarch  29,  1991    two  days  after  the  hearing  that  led  to\r\n\nBiltcliffe's suspension.  She filed suit several months later.\r\n\nII.  THE LITIGATION\r          II.  THE LITIGATION\r\n\n          Solon, the fabled  Greek legislator, once characterized\r\n\nthe best type of city as one \"in which those who are not wronged,\r\n\nno  less than those who  are wronged, exert  themselves to punish\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthe  wrongdoers.\"   Plutarch,  Plutarch's  Lives 455  (Bernadotte\r                                                          \r\n\nPerrin trans., 1914).  Here, the plaintiff's complaint alleged in\r\n\nsubstance that the City and certain municipal officials2 inverted\r\n\nthe Solonic ideal:   when the plaintiff responded forcefully (but\r\n\nappropriately) to Biltcliffe's racial slurs, the defendants sided\r\n\nwith the  wrongdoer and instead punished  Scott-Harris by ousting\r\n\nher from her  position under  a blatant pretext.   The  plaintiff\r\n\nalleged  that, in  so doing,  the  defendants abridged  her First\r\n\nAmendment  rights and  set the  stage for  redress under  section\r\n\n1983.  See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 274, 287  (1977) (explaining that in  order to prevail on  a\r\n\nsection 1983  claim based on  the First Amendment,  the plaintiff\r\n\nmust  prove  that her  protected  speech  was  a  substantial  or\r\n\nmotivating factor in the decision to eliminate her job).\r\n\n          At trial the defendants  asserted that their motives in\r\n\npassing the  challenged ordinance  were exclusively fiscal.   The\r\n\nplaintiff disagreed,  contending that racial animus  and a desire\r\n\nto punish  her for  protected speech, not  budgetary constraints,\r\n\nspurred  the introduction and passage  of the ordinance.   On May\r\n\n26,  1994,  evidently persuaded  by  the  plaintiff's efforts  to\r\n\nconnect Dot to her dismissal, the jury returned a verdict against\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The  plaintiff  originally sued  a plethora  of defendants.\r\nShe quickly narrowed  the field to Connors,  Roderick, Bogan, and\r\nthe City.  During the ensuing trial, the judge directed a verdict\r\nin  Connors' favor.  The plaintiff has not contested that ruling,\r\nand  we discuss these appeals as if Bogan, Roderick, and the City\r\nwere the sole defendants.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nall three defendants.3\r\n\n          The  verdict form  memorialized the  jury's conclusions\r\n\n(1) that the plaintiff's  constitutionally protected speech was a\r\n\nsubstantial  or motivating  factor  both in  Bogan's decision  to\r\n\nrecommend enactment  of the ordinance and  in Roderick's decision\r\n\nto work for its  passage, and (2) that these  actions proximately\r\n\ncaused  the  extirpation  of the  HHS  director's  position.   As\r\n\noriginally  returned,  the  verdict form  added  an  inconvenient\r\n\nwrinkle;  it indicated that the plaintiff had not proven that the\r\n\nCity's  professed desire  to  enact the  ordinance for  budgetary\r\n\nreasons was pretextual.   Out  of the jury's  earshot, the  judge\r\n\nexpressed her  concern that  the jury's findings  were internally\r\n\ninconsistent.   After a brief  colloquy, she resubmitted the case\r\n\nto the jury with  appropriate supplemental instructions.  Shortly\r\n\nthereafter  the  jury  returned  a  revised  verdict  form  which\r\n\nreiterated everything except the  \"no pretext\" finding.   In that\r\n\nwise,  the jury,  having reconsidered  the matter,  now concluded\r\n\nthat  the  City's  stated  reason for  wanting  the  ordinance   \r\n\nbudgetary concerns   was not its true reason.\r\n\n          The  jury  assessed  compensatory  damages  against all\r\n\nthree  defendants,  jointly  and  severally,  in  the  amount  of\r\n\n$156,000;  found Bogan liable for  punitive damages in the amount\r\n\nof $60,000; and found Roderick liable for punitive damages in the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The  jury   found  against   the  plaintiff  on   her  race\r\ndiscrimination claim, and she does not contest that finding here.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\namount  of   $15,000.4     The  court  subsequently   denied  the\r\n\ndefendants' motions  for  judgment notwithstanding  the  verdict.\r\n\nThese appeals followed   but not without a  perturbing procedural\r\n\nprelude.\r\n\nIII.  THE NOTICES OF APPEAL\r          III.  THE NOTICES OF APPEAL\r\n\n          Rule  4(a)(1)  of  the   Federal  Rules  of   Appellate\r\n\nProcedure  requires that  notices of  appeal  \"be filed  with the\r\n\nclerk  of the  district court within  30 days  after the  date of\r\n\nentry of the judgment  or order appealed from.\"   Compliance with\r\n\nthis  rule is  mandatory and  jurisdictional; while  a court  may\r\n\nconstrue  the rule's  strictures  liberally, it  may not  wink at\r\n\nthem.

Precision Valley Aviation, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n26 F.3d 220, 223 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          In  this  instance  the   district  court  entered  the\r\n\nappealable order    the order denying  the defendants' post-trial\r\n\nmotions  for  judgment  n.o.v.     on  January  30,  1995.    The\r\n\ndefendants did not file  their notices of appeal until  August of\r\n\nthat  year.  Without more, Rule 4(a)(1) would bar the maintenance\r\n\nof these appeals.\r\n\n          The  appeal  period  denominated by  Rule  4(a)(1)  is,\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Although punitive damages may  lie against individuals in a\r\nsection 1983 action,  see, e.g., Keenan v.

One such exception,\r\n\nadded to the Appellate Rules in 1991, provides:\r\n\n          The district  court, if  it finds (a)  that a\r\n          party entitled  to notice  of the entry  of a\r\n          judgment or order did not receive such notice\r\n          from the clerk or any party within 21 days of\r\n          its  entry and  (b)  that no  party would  be\r\n          prejudiced, may, upon motion filed within 180\r\n          days  of entry  of the  judgment or  order or\r\n          within  7  days of  receipt  of  such notice,\r\n          whichever  is  earlier, reopen  the  time for\r\n          appeal for a period of 14 days from  the date\r\n          of the entry of  the order reopening the time\r\n          for appeal.\r\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6).  The mention of \"notice\" in Rule 4(a)(6)\r\n\nis a reference to Fed. R. Civ. P. 77(d), which provides:\r\n\n          Immediately  upon the  entry of  an order  or\r\n          judgment the  clerk shall serve  a notice  of\r\n          entry by  mail in the manner  provided for in\r\n          Rule 5 upon  each party who is not in default\r\n          for failure to appear,  and shall make a note\r\n          in the docket of the mailing.   Any party may\r\n          in addition  serve a notice of  such entry in\r\n          the manner provided in Rule 5 for the service\r\n          of papers.   Lack of  notice of the  entry by\r\n          the clerk does not  affect the time to appeal\r\n          or  relieve or authorize the court to relieve\r\n          a party for failure to appeal within the time\r\n          allowed, except  as permitted in Rule 4(a) of\r\n          the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.\r\n\n          These  rules lie  at the  center of  the jurisdictional\r\n\njumble  that  confronts us.    On  the defendants'  motions,  the\r\n\ndistrict court held a hearing and determined that Fed. R. App. P.\r\n\n4(a)(6) appropriately could be  invoked to excuse the defendants'\r\n\nseeming tardiness.  The  plaintiff's cross-appeal challenges this\r\n\ndetermination.  Because Rule  4(a)(6) is relatively new, we  have\r\n\nnot yet had occasion to construe it.  We do so today, deciding at\r\n\nthe outset that the standard of review which governs a district's\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\ncourt's determinations under Rule 4(a)(6) is abuse of discretion.\r\n\nAccord Nunley  v. City of Los Angeles, 52 F.3d 792, 794 (9th Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1995).\r\n\n          Certain  elements  of  the  Rule  4(a)(6) calculus  are\r\n\nessentially undisputed:  the  defendants were parties entitled to\r\n\nnotice of the  entry of  the appealable final  order; their  Rule\r\n\n4(a)(6) motions,  filed on April 10 and 11, 1995, came within 180\r\n\ndays of  the entry of that order; and no party would be subjected\r\n\nto  cognizable prejudice by the  granting of the  motions.  Thus,\r\n\nthe  decisive  questions  in  this  case  relate  to  whether the\r\n\ndefendants  received notice of the  entry of the  order within 21\r\n\ndays, and if not,  whether they filed their Rule  4(a)(6) motions\r\n\nwithin  seven days of the time when they eventually received such\r\n\nnotice.\r\n\n          Both of these questions  involve an appreciation of the\r\n\nkind  of notice that Rule  4(a)(6) contemplates.   In terms, Rule\r\n\n4(a)(6)  advances a unitary concept of notice; its two references\r\n\nto \"such notice\" plainly relate back to the phrase \"notice of the\r\n\nentry of a judgment or order.\"   The problem, exemplified by this\r\n\ncase, is that the rule does not specify whether that  notice must\r\n\nbe written notice or  actual notice.  That problem  defies facile\r\n\nsolutions, and the courts of appeals which have addressed it thus\r\n\nfar have not  achieved consensus.   Compare Avolio  v. County  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nSuffolk, 29 F.3d  50, 53  (2d Cir. 1994)  (holding that the  rule\r                 \r\n\ncontemplates written notice) with Nunley, 52 F.3d at 794 (holding\r                                                  \r\n\nthat actual notice suffices) and Zimmer St. Louis, Inc. v. Zimmer\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nCo.,  32  F.3d 357,  359  (8th  Cir.  1994) (same).    Though  we\r             \r\n\nacknowledge  that  the  phrase, simpliciter,  is  susceptible  of\r                                                     \r\n\nmultiple  interpretations,  we  believe  that the  references  to\r\n\n\"notice\"  in Rule  4(a)(6), taken  in context,  are best  read as\r\n\nrequiring written notice.\r\n\n          Our starting  point is  our  perception that  Appellate\r\n\nRule  4(a)(6) and  Civil Rule 77(d)  must be read  in pari passu.\r                                                                          \r\n\nAccord Nunley, 52 F.3d at  795.  The text of Rule  77(d) requires\r                       \r\n\nthe clerk  to serve the notice  of entry of an  order or judgment\r\n\n\"by mail.\"   Because a  mailed notice is  invariably written,  it\r\n\nseems  logical to conclude that  when reference is  made later in\r\n\nthe  text  to  \"lack of  notice  of  the  entry,\" that  reference\r\n\ncontemplates lack of written notice.\r                                      \r\n\n          We think that further evidence  to the same effect  can\r\n\nbe gleaned from the  scrivenings of the Advisory Committee.   The\r\n\nAdvisory Committee's Notes are entitled to weight in interpreting\r\n\nfederal  rules of practice and procedure.  See Whitehouse v. U.S.\r                                                                           \r\n\nDist. Ct.  for Dist.  of R.I.,  53 F.3d 1349,  1364-65 (1st  Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1995).  Here, they tell us that Rule 4(a)(6)\r\n\n          provides a limited opportunity for  relief in\r\n          circumstances where the notice of  entry of a\r\n          judgment or order, required  to be mailed  by\r\n          the  clerk of the  district court pursuant to\r\n          [Rule  77(d)], is  either not  received by  a\r\n          party or is received so late as to impair the\r\n          opportunity  to  file  a  timely   notice  of\r\n          appeal.\r\n\nFed.  R.  App.  P.  4(a)(6), Advisory  Committee's  Notes.    The\r\n\nstatement \"required to be mailed\" refers to \"notice of entry of a\r\n\njudgment or order,\" again  suggesting that the notice must  be in\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nwriting.  We believe that when a procedural rule uses the precise\r\n\nphrase employed by  the Advisory Committee, it  can reasonably be\r\n\ninferred that the phrase means the same thing in both contexts.\r\n\n          Policy  concerns  point  us  in  the   same  direction.\r\n\nReading  Rule 4(a)(6)  to  require written  notice will  simplify\r\n\nfuture  proceedings.   As  the familiar  request  to \"put  it  in\r\n\nwriting\" suggests, writings are more readily susceptible to proof\r\n\nthan  oral communications.  In particular, the receipt of written\r\n\nnotice (or its  absence) should be more  easily demonstrable than\r\n\nattempting to discern whether (and, if so, when) a party received\r\n\nactual  notice.    Such a  scheme  not  only  takes  much of  the\r\n\nguesswork  out of  the  equation, but  also,  because Rule  77(d)\r\n\nspecifically provides that parties  who do not wish to  rely upon\r\n\nthe  clerk to  transmit the  requisite written  notice may  do so\r\n\nthemselves,  the  scheme  confers  certitude  without  leaving  a\r\n\nvictorious litigant at the mercy of a slipshod clerk.\r\n\n          To sum up, we  hold that written notice is  required to\r\n\ntrigger  the  relevant  time  period  under  Rule  4(a)(6);  oral\r\n\ncommunications or other  forms of actual  notice will not  serve.\r\n\nWe now apply this holding to the facts at hand.\r\n\n          The district  court found  that the defendants  did not\r\n\nreceive  written notice of the entry of the operative order until\r\n\nApril  7, 1995, when the  plaintiff's counsel sent  them a demand\r\n\nletter  seeking satisfaction  of the  judgments.  The  court made\r\n\nthis  finding  against  a  backdrop  of   unusual  events.    The\r\n\ndefendants' motions for judgment  n.o.v. were argued on September\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n29, 1994.  During that session, an unrecorded sidebar  conference\r\n\noccurred.   The  court's  comments at  that  conference left  all\r\n\ncounsel  with the  distinct impression  that an  appealable final\r\n\njudgment would not  enter until the court decided the plaintiff's\r\n\npending application for attorneys' fees.  Although the impression\r\n\nwas  mistaken, see Budinich v.  Becton Dickinson &amp;  Co., 486 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n196, 202-03 (1988) (holding that the appeal period commences once\r\n\na  final decision on the merits has been entered, irrespective of\r\n\nany  claim  for attorneys'  fees),  it  proved persistent.    The\r\n\nplaintiff's lawyer,  no less than defense  counsel, labored under\r\n\nthe  misimpression; he wrote to  the defense team  on February 2,\r\n\n1995,  stating  in  relevant  part:    \"I  received  the  Court's\r\n\nmemorandum  and order on the defendants' motion for J.N.O.V.  The\r\n\nonly  remaining  issue  before  judgment can  be  entered  is the\r                                                                   \r\n\nplaintiff's  unopposed  motion  for attorney's  fees.\"  (Emphasis\r\n\nsupplied).\r\n\n          Unbeknownst  to  the parties,  however,  the  court had\r\n\ngranted the plaintiff's motion for  attorneys' fees in late 1994.\r\n\nThe  clerk  entered this  order  on the  docket  but, apparently,\r\n\nneglected to serve  copies of the  order or the  docket entry  on\r\n\ncounsel.   To  complicate matters  further, when  defense counsel\r\n\nmade  inquiries to the clerk in February  and March of 1995 as to\r\n\nwhether  an  order  had  been   entered  disposing  of  the   fee\r\n\napplication, the clerk said that one had not.\r\n\n          Last  but not least, although all counsel in one way or\r\n\nanother  had  actual   notice  of  the  order  that   denied  the\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\ndefendants'  motions for  judgment  n.o.v. by  February 1,  1995,\r\n\ncases discussing Rule 4(a)(6)  differentiate between notice of an\r\n\norder and notice of the  entry of the order, indicating that  the\r\n\nrule contemplates  the latter.   See  Virella-Nieves v. Briggs  &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nStratton Corp.,  53 F.3d 451,  452-54 (1st  Cir. 1995).   In this\r                        \r\n\ninstance the clerk attempted to furnish such notice, but one copy\r\n\nof the court's  order was addressed  incorrectly and returned  by\r\n\nthe  Post Office as undeliverable, while another copy, plucked by\r\n\na different lawyer from the clerk's office, bore no notation that\r\n\nit had been entered on the docket.  From this  tangled record the\r\n\ndistrict  court  concluded  that,  though at  least  one  defense\r\n\nattorney  received actual  notice of  the entry  of the  order on\r\n\nFebruary 24, 1995,5  it was not  until April 7,  1995   when  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  attorney demanded  satisfaction of  the  judgments  \r\n\nthat  the  defendants received  a  written  notice sufficient  to\r\n\nanimate Rule 4(a)(6).  They filed their excusatory motions within\r\n\nseven days of their receipt of this notice.\r\n\n          Given these facts, and given the confused circumstances\r\n\nthat  contributed to the muddle, the district court did not abuse\r\n\nits discretion in  finding that the requirements  of Rule 4(a)(6)\r\n\nhad been  met and in  reopening the time  for appeal.   Since the\r\n\ndefendants all filed  their notices of  appeal within the  14-day\r\n\nperiod  that began on August  14, 1995, when  Judge Saris entered\r\n\nher  order reopening the time for doing  so, we conclude that the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5We note, parenthetically, that  even this notice came after\r\nthe 21-day period specified by Rule 4(a)(6) had elapsed.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nappeals are properly before us.\r\n\nIV.  THE VERDICT FORM\r          IV.  THE VERDICT FORM\r\n\n          The  defendants collectively  assert that  the district\r\n\ncourt erred in refusing to declare a mistrial when presented with\r\n\nthe  original  verdict  form  and added  impudence  to  injury by\r\n\nresubmitting the  case for further  deliberation.  We  review the\r\n\ndistrict court's denial of the defendants' motions for a mistrial\r\n\nfor abuse  of discretion.   See Clemente  v. Carnicon-P.R.  Mgmt.\r                                                                           \r\n\nAssocs., 52  F.3d 383,  388  (1st Cir.  1995).   We evaluate  the\r                 \r\n\njudge's  related actions,  namely,  her decisions  to reject  the\r\n\noriginal  verdict form and to resubmit the matter, under the same\r\n\nstandard of  review.   See Santiago-Negron v.  Castro-Davila, 865\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 431, 444 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\n\n          The defendants' argument on this point boils  down to a\r\n\nclaim that the  district court  crafted a verdict  form that  was\r\n\nstructurally flawed; that the  jury responded to it  by returning\r\n\ntwo  irreconcilable  findings; and  that, therefore,  Judge Saris\r\n\nshould  have granted the defendants' motions for a mistrial.  But\r\n\nit  is not enough to  preserve the defendants'  point that, after\r\n\nthe jury  first returned  with the  verdict form,  the defendants\r\n\npounced  on the  perceived  inconsistency and  moved to  pass the\r\n\ncase.   Rather, the viability  of this assignment  of error harks\r\n\nback  to  the  circumstances  surrounding the  emergence  of  the\r\n\nverdict  form.   Although the  defendants now  say that  the form\r\n\ntempted potential confusion, they failed to object when the judge\r\n\ninitially submitted it to the jury.  The failure to object to the\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nstructure of a  verdict form  before the jury  retires, like  the\r\n\nfailure to object  to any  other portion of  the judge's  charge,\r\n\nconstitutes  a waiver.  See Fed. R. Civ.  P. 51; see also Phav v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTrueblood,  Inc., 915 F.2d 764, 769 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that\r                          \r\n\nRule 51  applies to verdict forms as well as to the trial court's\r\n\noral instructions);  Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 918\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st   Cir.  1988)  (\"If  a  slip  has  been  made,  the  parties\r\n\ndetrimentally affected must act expeditiously to cure it, not lie\r\n\nin wait  and ask for another  trial when matters turn  out not to\r\n\ntheir liking.\").\r\n\n          We need not probe this point too profoundly, for in all\r\n\nevents  the  judge  handled   the  perceived  incongruity  in  an\r\n\nagreeable manner.    When  a verdict  appears  to  be  internally\r\n\ninconsistent, the safest course    in the absence of  irreparable\r\n\ndamage,  and  none appears  here    is  to defer  its acceptance,\r\n\nconsult with  counsel, give  the jury  supplemental instructions,\r\n\nand recommit the matter for further consideration.  See Hafner v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nBrown, 983  F.2d 570, 575 (4th Cir. 1992) (\"If the district judge\r               \r\n\nconcludes that an inconsistent verdict reflects jury confusion or\r\n\nuncertainty, he or she has the duty to clarify the  law governing\r\n\nthe case and resubmit the verdict for a jury decision.\"); Poduska\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Ward, 895 F.2d 854, 856 (1st Cir. 1990) (deeming it \"precisely\r                 \r\n\ncorrect\" for a judge, faced with an unclear and inconsistent jury\r\n\nverdict, to provide  supplemental instructions and then  recommit\r\n\nthe matter  to the jury).   This is exactly the  course of action\r\n\nthat  Judge Saris  followed.   The  actual instructions  that she\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\ngave,  first orally  and then  in  a written  response to  a jury\r\n\nquestion,  were   unimpugnable.6     We  discern  no   error,  no\r\n\nunfairness,  and no  abuse  of discretion  either in  the judge's\r\n\nhandling  of matters related to the verdict form or in her denial\r\n\nof the defendants' motions for a mistrial.\r\n\nV.  MUNICIPAL LIABILITY\r          V.  MUNICIPAL LIABILITY\r\n\n          We  turn  now to  the  City's  principal assignment  of\r\n\nerror.   Clearly, a municipality may be held liable under section\r\n\n1983   for  the  passage  of  a  single  ordinance  or  piece  of\r\n\nlegislation.   See, e.g., Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, 475 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n469, 480 (1986).  Although municipal liability cannot be based on\r\n\nthe doctrine of respondeat superior in this context,  see Monell,\r                                                                          \r\n\n436 U.S. at 691, such liability can flow from a  finding that the\r\n\ncity  itself  has  acted  through  an  official decision  of  its\r\n\nlegislative body.7  Hence,  from a purely theoretical standpoint,\r\n\nnothing prevents a determination  that, if the ordinance  here in\r\n\nquestion    which was passed by a majority vote of the Fall River\r\n\nCity Council and approved by the mayor   violates the plaintiff's\r\n\nFirst Amendment rights, then the City is liable for the violation\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Neither  Bogan nor  Roderick  voiced any  objection to  the\r\ncourt's supplemental instructions.   The lone objection lodged by\r\nthe City  challenged the  judge's interchanging of  \"real reason\"\r\nand  \"true reason\"  during  her supplemental  instructions.   The\r\njudge understandably dismissed this  objection as nitpicking, and\r\nthe City (wisely, in our view) has not resuscitated it on appeal.\r\n\n     7Such  a  decision  can  be manifested  either  through  the\r\nenactment  of an ordinance or through the adoption of a municipal\r\npolicy.  See, e.g., Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 479-81; Monell, 436 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\nat 690.  Thus, adoption-of-policy cases are pertinent to a survey\r\nof enactment-of-ordinance cases.\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nunder section 1983.\r\n\n          We pause at this juncture.  We think it is important to\r\n\nnote  early  on  that  the  defendants  have  not challenged  the\r\n\npremise, or the district judge's confirmatory ruling, that Scott-\r\n\nHarris'  speech was protected by the First Amendment in the sense\r\n\nneeded  to give  rise to  a claim  under section  1983.   Yet the\r\n\nSupreme Court has laid down important restrictions:  to give rise\r\n\nto a section 1983 action, a  plaintiff's speech must have been on\r\n\na  matter  of public  concern,  and  her interest  in  expressing\r\n\nherself  must  not  be  outweighed  by  the  state's  interest as\r\n\nemployer  in promoting  the efficiency  of the  services that  it\r\n\nperforms.  See Waters v. Churchill, 114 S. Ct. 1878, 1884 (1994);\r                                            \r\n\nConnick v. Myers, 461 U.S. 138, 142 (1983).\r                          \r\n\n          Given the Supreme Court's application of these tests in\r\n\nConnick, 461 U.S. at  147-54, one could argue that  Scott-Harris'\r                 \r\n\ncomments about, and efforts  to discipline, a particular employee\r\n\ndo not qualify as  speech on a matter  of public concern.   We do\r\n\nnot pursue  this point because it  has not been argued  to us; it\r\n\nhas, therefore, effectively been waived.  We mention it, however,\r\n\nbecause we do not intend our opinion to be taken as deciding that\r\n\nthe facts here asserted comprise protected speech.\r\n\n          We note, moreover, that  there is another unusual twist\r\n\nto this  case.   In  most similar  instances, the  constitutional\r\n\ndeprivation is apparent on  the face of the  ordinance or in  the\r\n\ntext  of the  challenged municipal  policy, thus  eliminating any\r\n\nneed for  a  predicate inquiry  into  the motives  of  individual\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nlegislators.  See,  e.g., City  of Oklahoma City  v. Tuttle,  471\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.  808, 822-23 (1985); City of Newport v.

Geisse,  857 F.2d 1300,\r                                                          \r\n\n1303  (9th Cir. 1988); Little v. City  of N. Miami, 805 F.2d 962,\r                                                            \r\n\n967  (11th  Cir.  1986);  18A  James  Perkowitz-Solheim  et  al.,\r\n\nMcQuillin Mun. Corp.   53.173 (3d ed. 1993).   Here, by contrast,\r                              \r\n\nthe City enacted an ordinance which, on its face, is  benign.  In\r\n\ncases  like this one, implicating the exercise of First Amendment\r\n\nrights, liability under section 1983 can attach to the passage of\r\n\na  facially  benign law  only if  one  peers beneath  the textual\r\n\nfacade and concludes  that the  legislative body acted  out of  a\r\n\nconstitutionally  impermissible  motive.    This  is  a  delicate\r\n\nbusiness,   but   this  court   previously   has  sanctioned   an\r\n\ninvestigation into the motives that  underlay the enactment of  a\r\n\nfacially neutral ordinance for the purpose of assessing liability\r\n\nunder section 1983, see  Acevedo-Cordero v. Cordero-Santiago, 958\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1992), and we are bound by that precedent.\r\n\n          Still, the accumulated jurisprudence  leaves perplexing\r\n\nproblems of proof  unanswered.  The  baseline principle is  well-\r\n\nsettled:  legislators' bad motives may be proven by either direct\r\n\nor  circumstantial evidence.  See, e.g., United States v. City of\r                                                                           \r\n\nBirmingham, 727 F.2d  560, 564-65 (6th  Cir.), cert. denied,  469\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S. 821 (1984); Smith v. Town of Clarkton, 682 F.2d 1055,  1064-\r                                                    \r\n\n65 (4th Cir. 1982).  But this principle speaks to the qualitative\r                                                                           \r\n\nnature of the evidence that is gathered; it  does not address the\r\n\nquantitative  question.  That question is best framed as follows:\r                      \r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\nHow  many  municipal  legislators  (or,  put  another  way,  what\r\n\npercentage  of  the  legislative  body)  must  be  spurred  by  a\r\n\nconstitutionally  impermissible  motive  before the  municipality\r\n\nitself  may be held liable under section 1983 for the adoption of\r\n\na  facially neutral  policy or  ordinance?   This is  a difficult\r\n\nquestion, and the case law proves a fickle companion.\r\n\n          Some courts appear to have held that the plaintiff must\r\n\nadduce evidence sufficient to show that a majority of the members\r\n\nof the legislative body  acted from a constitutionally proscribed\r\n\nmotive before this kind of municipal liability can attach.  Often\r\n\nthis  position is implied  rather than  specifically articulated.\r\n\nSee generally United  States v.  City of Yonkers,  856 F.2d  444,\r                                                          \r\n\n457-58   (2d  Cir.  1988).    But  some  courts  have  been  more\r\n\nforthcoming.  In Church v. City of Huntsville, 30 F.3d 1332 (11th\r                                                       \r\n\nCir. 1994), a group of homeless persons alleged that the city had\r\n\nadopted  a  policy of  excluding them  from  the community.   The\r\n\nplaintiffs  based  their section  1983  action  on  the acts  and\r\n\nstatements  of one individual on a five-member city council.  The\r\n\ncourt  observed that  a single  council member  did not  have any\r\n\nauthority either  to establish  municipal policy  or to  bind the\r\n\nmunicipality.  See  id. at  1343-44.  It  therefore examined  the\r                                 \r\n\nevidence against the  other four councilors, finding that two had\r\n\nopposed the alleged policy and that two had expressed no views on\r\n\nthe  subject.    The  court  refused  to  draw  an  inference  of\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent  from the  silence of council  members, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at 1344 n.5, and rejected the plaintiffs' claim.\r             \r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\n          Other courts,  acting principally in the  areas of race\r\n\nand  gender discrimination,  have  not required  evidence of  the\r\n\nmotives of  a majority of  the legislative  body before  imposing\r\n\nliability on the municipality under section 1983.  Representative\r\n\nof this line of cases is United States v. City of Birmingham, 538\r                                                                      \r\n\nF. Supp.  819 (E.D. Mich.  1982), aff'd, 727  F.2d 560  (6th Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1984).   There,  the  district  court  held  a  city  liable  for\r\n\nviolations  of the Fair Housing  Act, 42 U.S.C.     3604(a), 3617\r\n\n(1994),  based  on  the   actions  of  a  seven-member  municipal\r\n\ncommission  which  had  blocked  the  construction  of  racially-\r\n\nintegrated housing by  a four-to-three vote.   While opponents of\r\n\nthe  project  had  attributed  their  position  to  a  series  of\r\n\narticulated nondiscriminatory rationales, the court looked behind\r\n\ntheir avowals and  ruled, based  on a combination  of direct  and\r\n\ncircumstantial  evidence,  that  racial  considerations  actually\r\n\npropelled the commission's action.  538  F. Supp. at 826-27.  The\r\n\ncourt  concluded that  the  city could  be  held liable  for  the\r\n\ncommissioners'  animus even  though  there was  no  proof of  the\r\n\nmotives  of all four commissioners who voted to kill the project;\r\n\nit  was enough,  the court  suggested, if  \"racial considerations\r\n\nwere a motivating factor among a significant percentage  of those\r\n\nwho were responsible  for the city's [rejection of the project].\"\r\n\nId. at 828.  Explicating this construct, the court indicated that\r             \r\n\na \"significant percentage\" would not have to encompass the entire\r\n\nfour-person majority.  See  id. at 828-29.  Noting  evidence that\r                                         \r\n\nracial  concerns motivated \"at least  two of the  four members of\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nthe majority faction,\" the court declared that \"[t]hat fact alone\r\n\nmay be  sufficient to attribute a  racially discriminatory intent\r\n\nto the City.\"  Id. at 829.8\r                            \r\n\n          Two   Massachusetts   cases   also  premise   municipal\r\n\nliability on  evidence  concerning less  than a  majority of  the\r\n\nrelevant legislative body.

Though  the  city's\r\nliability derived from the  actions of a 12-member city  council,\r\nthe court focused  almost exclusively on statements  by the mayor\r\n(who  had only one vote on the council) and race-based opposition\r\nexpressed by  a few other councilors.   The court did not premise\r\nits  decision on a requirement that a majority of the council had\r\nacted out of impermissible motives.\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\ncourt upheld a finding of liability based on this evidence and on\r\n\nstatements by  three other  committee members that  the plaintiff\r\n\nhad  been a  victim of  discrimination and/or  had been  the best\r\n\nqualified candidate for the job.  See id. at 81-82.\r                                                   \r\n\n          The precedent in this area is uncertain, and persuasive\r\n\narguments can  be made on both sides.  On the one hand, because a\r\n\nmunicipal ordinance can become law only by a majority vote of the\r\n\ncity  council, there is  a certain incongruity  in allowing fewer\r\n\nthan a majority  of the council  members to subject  the city  to\r\n\nliability  under  section  1983.    On  the  other  hand, because\r\n\ndiscriminatory animus  is insidious and  a clever pretext  can be\r\n\nhard to  unmask, the law sometimes  constructs procedural devices\r\n\nto ease a victim's burden of proof.  See, e.g., McDonnell-Douglas\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp.  v.

Where,  as here, a plaintiff alleges that a\r\n\ncity's  councilors connived  to victimize  her by  the pretextual\r\n\npassage  of  a  facially  neutral ordinance,  it  may  be  overly\r\n\nmechanistic  to  hold  her  to  strict  proof  of the  subjective\r\n\nintentions of a numerical majority of council members.\r\n\n          Cognizant of  these competing  concerns, we  eschew for\r\n\nthe  time  being  a bright-line  rule.    Rather,  we assume  for\r\n\nargument's  sake  (but  do not  decide)  that  in a  sufficiently\r\n\ncompelling  case the  requirement  that the  plaintiff prove  bad\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nmotive  on  the  part  of  a  majority  of  the  members  of  the\r\n\nlegislative body might  be relaxed and a  proxy accepted instead.\r\n\nNevertheless,  any such  relaxation  would be  contingent on  the\r\n\nplaintiff mustering evidence of  both (a) bad motive on  the part\r\n\nof  at  least  a  significant   bloc  of  legislators,  and   (b)\r\n\ncircumstances suggesting  the probable complicity of  others.  By\r\n\nway of illustration, evidence of procedural anomalies, acquiesced\r\n\nin by  a majority of  the legislative  body, may support  such an\r\n\ninference.   See, e.g., City  of Birmingham, 727  F.2d at 564-65;\r                                                     \r\n\nTown of Clarkton, 682 F.2d at  1066-67.  By like token,  evidence\r                          \r\n\nindicating  that  the  legislators  bowed  to   an  impermissible\r\n\ncommunity animus, most commonly manifested by an unusual level of\r\n\nconstituent pressure, may  warrant such an inference.  See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nUnited States v.

Supp. at 824-27.  The key is  likelihood:  Has\r                    \r\n\nthe  plaintiff  proffered  evidence,  direct  or  circumstantial,\r\n\nwhich, when reasonable  inferences are drawn in  her favor, makes\r\n\nit  appear  more  probable  (i.e.,  more  likely  than  not) that\r\n\ndiscrimination was  the real  reason underlying the  enactment of\r\n\nthe ordinance or the adoption of the policy?\r\n\n          The  facts of this case  do not require  that we refine\r\n\nthe  point  to any  further extent.    Scott-Harris has  not only\r\n\nfailed to prove that a majority of the councilors possessed a bad\r\n\nmotive, but she also has failed  to furnish enough circumstantial\r\n\nevidence  to ground  a  finding that,  more  likely than  not,  a\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\ndiscriminatory animus propelled the City Council's action.\r\n\n          The evidence, viewed most hospitably to the plaintiff,9\r\n\nreveals  that six of  the nine councilors  voted in  favor of the\r\n\nchallenged ordinance and two opposed it.  The plaintiff presented\r\n\nsufficient  evidence from which a  jury could deduce  that one of\r\n\nthese  six, Roderick, along with Mayor  Bogan (who did not have a\r\n\nvote), acted  out of a bad motive.10  The plaintiff also produced\r\n\nsome glancing  evidence apropos  of Councilor Mitchell:   he  and\r\n\nRoderick  were   friends;  Roderick   spoke  to  him   about  the\r\n\nBiltcliffe/Scott-Harris  imbroglio;  and  Biltcliffe called  him,\r\n\npresumably to protest her  treatment.  The jury could  have found\r\n\nfrom other evidence in  the case that Mitchell probably  voted in\r\n\nfavor of the  ordinance (although the  record does not  eliminate\r\n\nthe possibility that he abstained).  Even though Mitchell did not\r\n\ntestify and  the substance of his conversations with Roderick and\r\n\nBiltcliffe are unknown, we assume arguendo that a jury reasonably\r\n\ncould infer that Mitchell, too, acted for a proscribed reason.\r\n\n          The  remaining  gaps  in  the  plaintiff's   proof  are\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9On the  question of  evidentiary sufficiency, we  review de\r\nnovo  the denial of the City's motion for judgment n.o.v.  Gibson\r                                                                           \r\nv. City of Cranston, 37  F.3d 731, 735 (1st  Cir. 1994).  We  are\r                             \r\nbound by  the  same decisional  standards  that bound  the  court\r\nbelow:    we must evaluate the  record without regard to  witness\r\ncredibility, testimonial  conflicts, or unevenness  in the weight\r\nof  the evidence,  see  id., and  we  must affirm  unless,  after\r                                     \r\nsurveying the evidence and  the inferences derivable therefrom in\r\nthe light most flattering  to the plaintiff, we determine  that a\r\nrational  factfinder could  not  have resolved  liability in  her\r\nfavor, see Veranda Beach Club, 936 F.2d at 1375.\r                                       \r\n\n     10We discuss the evidence against Roderick and Bogan in Part\r\nVI(C), infra.\r                      \r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nconsiderably more difficult to overlook.  None of the other seven\r\n\ncity council  members uttered any untoward  statements or engaged\r\n\nin  any suspicious  actions.   The  \"we  must slash  the  budget\"\r\n\npretext  had a ring of plausibility, and from aught that appears,\r\n\nnone of these  seven individuals had any way of  knowing that the\r\n\nposition-elimination ordinance  would not  save  the City  sorely\r\n\nneeded funds.   Nor is  there strong  circumstantial evidence  of\r\n\ncomplicity;  indeed, the record tells us almost nothing about the\r\n\ninclinations of the silent seven.11  Moreover, the plaintiff made\r\n\nvirtually no effort to adduce such evidence.  She neither deposed\r\n\nany of the seven nor called them as witnesses at trial.  She  did\r\n\nnot  attempt to show  that any of  the other four  councilors who\r\n\nvoted  for the ordinance had any basis  for doubting the truth of\r\n\nthe  party line  (\"we  must  slash  the  budget\")  or  that  they\r\n\npossessed ties to Roderick  or Bogan, or that they  were beholden\r\n\nto  Biltcliffe, or that they  were hostile to  Scott-Harris.  The\r\n\nstark fact is that the motivations of the council members   other\r\n\nthan  Roderick  and Mitchell     did  not receive  individualized\r\n\nscrutiny.   By  any  responsible standard,  this sparse  evidence\r\n\nfalls  short of  providing a  proper predicate  for a  finding of\r\n\nmunicipal liability.\r\n\n          We  do  not think  it is  a  coincidence that  in every\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11The  record does  show that  one council member  who voted\r\nagainst the  ordinance, John  Medeiros, called the  plaintiff and\r\nasked  why  \"they\" were  trying  to  get rid  of  her.   But  the\r\nplaintiff provided no  insight into  who \"they\" might  be and  no\r\nevidence  that \"they\" comprised a majority, or even a significant\r\nbloc, of the City Council.\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nanalogous case  in which municipal liability has  been imposed on\r\n\nevidence implicating less than a  majority of a legislative body,\r\n\nsubstantial  circumstantial  evidence   existed  from  which  the\r\n\nrequisite discriminatory animus  could be inferred.   In City  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nBirmingham, the evidence showed that the race-based opposition of\r                    \r\n\nconstituents  to integrated  housing was  widespread, pronounced,\r\n\nand  vociferously  articulated.     After  several  members   who\r\n\nsupported the  racially integrated  development were  ousted from\r\n\noffice, the commission responded to this unremitting pressure and\r\n\ntook  the  unprecedented step  of  submitting the  proposal  to a\r\n\ncommunity referendum.  538 F. Supp. at 826-29.  In Yonkers Bd. of\r                                                                           \r\n\nEduc.,  the  requisite inference  was  supported  by evidence  of\r               \r\n\nmassive constituent agitation  as well as by \"departures from the\r\n\nnormal  procedural  sequence\"  in   respect  to  the   challenged\r\n\nproposal.  837 F.2d at 1221. \r\n\n          In this case no such evidence exists.  Nothing suggests\r\n\nthe  City Council  deviated from  its  standard protocol  when it\r\n\nreceived and enacted the ordinance that abolished the plaintiff's\r\n\njob.  Nothing suggests that the  vote took place in an atmosphere\r\n\npermeated   by  widespread   constituent  pressure.12     Putting\r\n\nspeculation and surmise to one side, it simply cannot be inferred\r\n\nthat more than  two of the council  members who voted to  abolish\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12The plaintiff's assertion  that the publication of  front-\r\npage  articles about  her  plight in  the  local newspaper  shows\r\nconstituent  coercion  will not  wash.   There  is  a significant\r\ndifference between heightened public  interest   an environmental\r\nphenomenon  with  which  legislatures  grapple  constantly    and\r\npervasive constituent pressure.\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nthe  plaintiff's  position did  so  to punish  her  for protected\r\n\nspeech.    We  cannot rest  municipal  liability  on  so frail  a\r\n\nfoundation.   Because no reasonable  jury could find  against the\r\n\nCity  on the proof presented, Fall River's motion for judgment as\r\n\na matter of law should have been granted.\r\n\nVI.  INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY\r          VI.  INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY\r\n\n          Roderick and Bogan advance a different constellation of\r\n\narguments in support  of their  motions for judgment  n.o.v.

See, e.g., Acevedo-Cordero, 958 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 22-23; Aitchison  v.

We reaffirm today that the shield of legislative immunity\r\n\nlies within reach of city officials.\r\n\n          This  holding  does  not  end our  inquiry.    Although\r\n\nlegislative   immunity   is  absolute   within   certain  limits,\r\n\nlegislators  are not immune with respect to all actions that they\r\n\ntake.   The dividing line  is drawn along  a functional axis that\r\n\ndistinguishes between  legislative and administrative acts.   The\r\n\nformer are protected,  the latter are not.   See Acevedo-Cordero,\r                                                                          \r\n\n958F.2d at 23. We have useda pair of testsfor separating the two:\r\n\n          The first  test focuses on the  nature of the\r\n          facts used  to reach the given  decision.  If\r\n          the underlying facts on which the decision is\r\n          based  are  \"legislative   facts,\"  such   as\r\n          \"generalizations concerning a policy or state\r\n          of   affairs,\"   then    the   decision    is\r\n          legislative.    If  the  facts  used  in  the\r\n          decision  making are  more specific,  such as\r\n          those that relate  to particular  individuals\r\n          or   situations,   then   the   decision   is\r\n          administrative.   The second test  focuses on\r\n          \"the particularity of the impact of the state\r\n          of   action.\"     If   the   action  involves\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\nU.S. 306, 324 (1973); Harwood, 69 F.3d at 629.\r                                       \r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\n          establishment  of a  general  policy,  it  is\r\n          legislative;  if  the  action \"single[s]  out\r\n          specifiable  individuals  and affect[s]  them\r\n          differently     from    others,\"     it    is\r\n          administrative.\r\n\nCutting v.

When the material facts are\r                             \r\n\ngenuinely disputed, however, the  question is properly treated as\r\n\na question of  fact, and  its disposition must  await the  trial.\r\n\nSee id.\r                 \r\n\n          In some  ways, Acevedo-Cordero  and this case  are fair\r                                                  \r\n\ncongeners.    There,  as   here,  the  defendants  asserted  that\r\n\nbudgetary  woes  sparked  the  enactment  of  a  facially  benign\r\n\nposition-elimination ordinance.  There, as here, the plaintiff(s)\r\n\ncountered  with  a  charge  that,  in  fact,  a  constitutionally\r\n\nproscribed reason lurked  beneath the surface.   There, as  here,\r\n\nconflicted  evidence as  to the  defendants' true  motives raised\r\n\ngenuine issues of material fact.  Acevedo-Cordero teaches that in\r                                                           \r\n\nsuch  situations the issue of  immunity must be  reserved for the\r\n\ntrial.  See id.\r                         \r\n\n          Judge   Saris   faithfully  applied   these  teachings,\r\n\nrefusing   to  reward  premature   attempts  by   the  individual\r\n\ndefendants  to dismiss  the action  on  the basis  of legislative\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nimmunity.  At  the end of  the trial, the  jury made two  crucial\r\n\nfindings.  First, it found that the defendants' stated reason for\r\n\nenacting the position-elimination  ordinance was  not their  real\r\n\nreason.   Second, it found that  the plaintiff's constitutionally\r\n\nsheltered  speech was a  substantial or motivating  factor in the\r\n\nactions which  Roderick and  Bogan took vis- -vis  the ordinance.\r\n\nThese  findings reflect  the  jury's belief  that the  individual\r\n\ndefendants  relied on facts relating to a particular individual  \r\n\nScott-Harris    in  the  decisionmaking calculus  and devised  an\r\n\nordinance that targeted Scott-Harris and  treated her differently\r\n\nfrom other managers employed by the City.\r\n\n          We think that in  passing on the individual defendants'\r\n\npost-trial motions,  the judge in effect  accepted these findings\r\n\nand concluded  that  the position-elimination  ordinance  (which,\r\n\nafter  all, constituted  no  more in  this  case than  the  means\r\n\nemployed by Scott-Harris' antagonists to fire her) constituted an\r\n\nadministrative rather than  a legislative  act.  As  long as  the\r\n\nquantum of proof  suffices   a matter to which  we shall return  \r\n\nboth this conclusion and its natural corollary (that Roderick and\r\n\nBogan  are  not  shielded  from liability  by  operation  of  the\r\n\ndoctrine of  legislative immunity) rest on  solid legal ground.14\r\n\nSee, e.g., Negron-Gaztambide v.

She posits\r\n\nthat, as a matter of law, her actions in respect to the position-\r\n\nelimination ordinance cannot be deemed the proximate cause of the\r\n\nharm to  Scott-Harris.15  She bases  this claim on the  fact that\r\n\nher vote alone was impuissant:  five votes would ensure enactment\r\n\nof the ordinance, but  six legislators voted for passage.   Thus,\r\n\nnot only was she unable to get  the ordinance enacted by herself,\r\n\nbut it also would have been passed without her cooperation.  This\r\n\nthesis  has  a patina  of  plausibility,  but  it  misstates  the\r\n\nquestion before us (and, consequently, we take no view of it).\r\n\n          According to accepted lore, section 1983 actions are to\r\n\nbe  considered   against  the  background  of   traditional  tort\r\n\nprinciples.

After all, Roderick  was\r\n\nnot just another face in the crowd:  she served as vice-president\r\n\nof the City  Council and  chaired its ordinance  committee; as  a\r\n\nresult, the jury easily could find that she played a  role in the\r\n\npassage of the ordinance that was disproportionate  to her single\r\n\nvote.  In order to gain approval, the ordinance had to go through\r\n\nthe five-member ordinance committee.   Roderick established  this\r\n\ncommittee's agenda, and  its favorable report on March  5 cleared\r\n\nthe way for the ordinance's enactment.17\r\n\n          Although the plaintiff's evidence in this regard is not\r\n\nrobust, it  suffices in the context  of the record as  a whole to\r\n\nrender the issue of causation susceptible to differing evaluative\r\n\ndeterminations.    Thus,  the  district  judge  did  not  err  in\r\n\nsubmitting the causation question  to the jury.  And  because the\r\n\njury  reasonably could have adopted one such view of the evidence\r\n\nand  concluded that Roderick made a successful effort to have the\r\n\nplaintiff ousted, the liability finding must stand.\r\n\n                 C.

This assertion is easily refuted.\r\n\n          In challenging a jury verdict on sufficiency grounds, a\r\n\ndefendant  labors under  a  heavy  burden.    See  supra  note  9\r                                                                  \r\n\n(elucidating  applicable   legal  standard  and   citing  cases).\r\n\nBecause  the evidence in this  case is capable  of supporting two\r\n\nsets  of divergent  inferences, Roderick  and Bogan  cannot carry\r\n\ntheir burden.\r\n\n          We choose not  to tarry.  It  suffices to say  that, on\r\n\nthis pleochroic record, the jury could have found that Biltcliffe\r\n\nused political connections to  hinder the investigation of Scott-\r\n\nHarris' accusations  by, inter  alia, banishing the  accuser, and\r                                              \r\n\nthat  Roderick and Bogan  were the instruments  of her vengeance.\r\n\nRoderick bore an animosity toward Scott-Harris based on a history\r\n\nof friction between the two women, and the jury permissibly could\r\n\nhave  found that when  Biltcliffe complained to  her about Scott-\r\n\nHarris'  charges, she  spoke to  Connors; that  when Scott-Harris\r\n\npersisted,  Roderick  agreed  to  push  the  position-elimination\r\n\nordinance despite  the fact that Scott-Harris  was performing her\r\n\nduties well; that the asserted budgetary basis for  the ordinance\r\n\nwas a sham;18 and that Roderick knew as much.\r\n\n          As to Bogan, much of the same evidence is relevant.  In\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     18On this point, the evidence permitted the jury to conclude\r\nthat,   rather  than   saving  money,   the  position-elimination\r\nordinance actually  cost more because it  necessitated the hiring\r\nof three new administrators to manage agencies that the plaintiff\r\nhad been supervising single-handed.\r\n\n                                36\r\r\n\naddition, the jury could  have found that he knew  Biltcliffe and\r\n\nresented Scott-Harris' outspoken efforts  to cashier her; that he\r\n\nabetted the  effort to save Biltcliffe's  sinecure by terminating\r\n\nScott-Harris (and no other  manager) for a bogus reason;  that he\r\n\nproposed   the  position-elimination   ordinance  to   that  end,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  Connors' opposition;  that he happily  signed it\r\n\ninto  law;  that when  he learned  of Scott-Harris'  intention to\r\n\naccept a  different municipal  position at a  reduced salary,  he\r\n\npulled the rug from under  her by increasing the responsibilities\r\n\nof  the job and shifting her to  a dingy office; that when Scott-\r\n\nHarris  tried  to  retract   her  rejection  of  this  diminished\r\n\nposition, he foiled her efforts to  do so; and that in all events\r\n\nBogan   showed  his   true  colors  by   shortening  Biltcliffe's\r\n\nsuspension.\r\n\n          To  be sure,  this  set of  conclusions  does not  flow\r\n\nineluctably from  the evidence,  but it represents  a permissible\r\n\nconstruction  of  the  record.   Consequently,  the  evidence  is\r\n\nadequate to support the verdicts against both Roderick and Bogan.\r\n\nVII.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\r          VII.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\r\n\n          Our journey is not yet ended.  The last leg requires us\r\n\nto  revisit  the  lower  court's  order  awarding  the  plaintiff\r\n\n$83,179.70 in counsel fees  and associated expenses against three\r\n\ndefendants  (Roderick,   Bogan,  and   the  City),   jointly  and\r\n\nseverally.\r\n\n          In a section 1983  action a court, \"in  its discretion,\r\n\nmay  allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee\r\n\n                                37\r\r\n\nas part  of the costs.\"   42 U.S.C.    1988 (1994).   Despite its\r\n\nseemingly precatory  tone, we  have interpreted this  language to\r\n\nmean that  \"a prevailing  plaintiff is presumptively  entitled to\r\n\nfee-shifting\"  in  a   section  1983  case.

For this purpose, a party prevails if  she succeeds\r\n\non a significant issue in the litigation and thereby achieves all\r\n\nor some meaningful part  of the benefit that she  envisioned when\r\n\nshe brought suit.   See Hensley v.  Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424,  433\r                                                       \r\n\n(1983); Pearson  v. Fair, 980 F.2d  37, 43 (1st Cir.  1992).  The\r                                  \r\n\nconverse,  of course, is equally  true:  if  a plaintiff's claims\r\n\nagainst  a  particular defendant  come to  naught,  she is  not a\r\n\nprevailing  party and  is not  entitled to  reap a  harvest under\r\n\nsection 1988.   See Nunez-Soto  v. Alvarado, 956  F.2d 1,  3 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1992).  Moreover, if a plaintiff succeeds in the trial court\r\n\nbut the  judgment she obtains  is reversed  on appeal, she  is no\r\n\nlonger entitled  to a  fee  award.   See Globe  Newspaper Co.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nBeacon Hill Arch. Comm'n, 100 F.3d 175, 195 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                                  \r\n\n          Applying  these standards  to the  case at  bar,  it is\r\n\nevident  that the matter  of attorneys'  fees must  be rethought.\r\n\nBecause the plaintiff prevailed below on claims against all three\r\n\ndefendants,  none of them opposed  her application for  fees.  In\r\n\ntheir  appeals, however, they preserved the issue of whether (and\r\n\n                                38\r\r\n\nto what extent)  the fee  award could withstand  the reversal  on\r\n\nappeal of all  or some  part of the  judgments.  This  precaution\r\n\nserves  the City in good  stead; because the  judgment against it\r\n\nmust be reversed, see supra Part V, the fee award against it must\r                                     \r\n\nbe nullified.\r\n\n          This  leaves a nagging question as to the status of the\r\n\naward  vis- -vis  Roderick  and Bogan.    On  the  one hand,  the\r\n\njudgments against  those two defendants remain  intact, see supra\r                                                                           \r\n\nPart  VI,  and,  thus,  as  to  them,  the  plaintiff  remains  a\r\n\nprevailing  party presumptively entitled to reasonable attorneys'\r\n\nfees.  On the  other hand, the record before  us is opaque as  to\r\n\nthe  proper  extent  of  that  entitlement.    This   opacity  is\r\n\nparticularly  pronounced because we do not know how much (if any)\r\n\nof the work  performed by  the plaintiff's lawyer  in respect  to\r\n\nScott-Harris' unsuccessful claims against  the City paved the way\r\n\nfor  her successful  claims  against  the individual  defendants.\r\n\nThis is  an important datum  because a court  may allow  fees for\r\n\ntime  spent  on unsuccessful  claims  only  if those  claims  are\r\n\nsufficiently linked to successful claims.  See Lipsett v. Blanco,\r                                                                          \r\n\n975 F.2d  934, 940-41 (1st Cir. 1992);  Aubin v. Fudala, 782 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n287, 290-92 (1st Cir. 1986).\r\n\n          We need go no further.  From what we have  said to this\r\n\njuncture,  it is apparent  that the matter  of fees must  be more\r\n\nfully  explored   and it  is preferable for  obvious reasons that\r\n\nthe trial court, as opposed to this court, undertake what amounts\r\n\nto an archeological dig  into counsel's time sheets and  make the\r\n\n                                39\r\r\n\nnecessary factual  determinations.   We therefore vacate  the fee\r\n\naward against the City  and remand so that the district court can\r\n\nreconsider the amount of  fees and costs that should  properly be\r\n\nassessed against the remaining defendants.\r\n\n          The plaintiff also has  prevailed on appeal against two\r\n\nof  the defendants, and she  is entitled to  a reasonable counsel\r\n\nfee for  the work  that yielded  this victory.   Though we  often\r\n\nentertain such fee applications directly, we have sometimes opted\r\n\nto have  the district  court  handle them.   See,  e.g., Rodi  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nVentetuolo, 941 F.2d  22, 31 (1st Cir.  1991); see also  1st Cir.\r                                                                 \r\n\nLoc. R. 39.2 (permitting  use of this alternative).   Because the\r\n\ndistrict  court must  in any  event reopen  its inquiry  into the\r\n\noverall  question of fees, we deem it expedient for the plaintiff\r\n\nto file her application for  fees on appeal with that court,  and\r\n\nfor  that court  to make  the supplementary award.   We  leave to\r\n\nJudge Saris the procedure to be  followed on remand in respect to\r\n\nboth   reexamination   of   the   original  award   and   initial\r\n\nconsideration  of the supplementary  award for  services rendered\r\n\nand expenses (apart from ordinary costs) incurred on appeal.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff's cross-appeal  (No. 95-2100)  is denied\r                    The  plaintiff's cross-appeal  (No. 95-2100)  is denied\r                                                                           \r\n\nand the district  court's order permitting  the reopening of  the\r          and the district  court's order permitting  the reopening of  the\r                                                                           \r\n\nappeal period is affirmed.

At\r\n\ntrial,  a jury found  the City of  Fall River (the  City) and two\r\n\nmunicipal officials liable under section 1983 for the  passage of\r\n\na facially neutral ordinance  that abolished the plaintiff's job.\r\n\nThe  defendants'  appeals  raise  a  tantalizing  question  about\r\n\nwhether  a  discriminatory animus  displayed  by  fewer than  the\r\n\nminimum  number  of city  council  members whose  votes  would be\r\n\nrequired to enact an ordinance can  (or should) be imputed to the\r\n\nmunicipality  itself.     Other  interesting   questions  abound,\r\n\nincluding  questions dealing  with  causation in  the context  of\r\n\nconstitutional torts and the availability of legislative immunity\r\n\ndefenses in that setting.  Before addressing any of these issues,\r\n\nhowever, we must  parse Fed. R.  App. P. 4  (a)(6) for the  first\r\n\ntime  and determine  whether  the defendants  have brought  their\r\n\nappeals in a timeous fashion.\r\n\nI.  A TALE OF ONE CITY\r          I.

When  Scott-Harris  entered the  City's\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nservice in 1987,  she became the  first African-American ever  to\r\n\nhold a managerial position  in the municipal government.   By all\r\n\naccounts  she performed quite  well at HHS.   Withal, she did not\r\n\nenjoy  a  problem-free  relationship  with  the City's  political\r\n\nhierarchs.    In  1988,  for example,  she  clashed  with Marilyn\r\n\nRoderick, the  vice-president of the City  Council.  Scott-Harris\r\n\nbelieved  that  Roderick  made  inappropriate  references  to  an\r\n\naspirant's ethnicity in the course of an employment interview and\r\n\nstormed out of  the room.   Shortly thereafter, she engaged  in a\r\n\nshouting  match  with Roderick.   When  Scott-Harris subsequently\r\n\nattempted to apologize, Roderick hung up the telephone.\r\n\n          Scott-Harris'  difficulties with  Roderick did  not end\r\n\nwith the aforedescribed incident.   There were periodic flare-ups\r\n\n   by way of  illustration, Roderick wrote  a letter  to the City\r\n\nAdministrator, Robert Connors, protesting  Scott-Harris' use of a\r\n\nCity-owned motor vehicle    but it was Scott-Harris'  reaction to\r\n\nthe dysphemisms spouted by  Dorothy (Dot) Biltcliffe, a nutrition\r\n\nprogram assistant  for the  City's Council  on Aging  (COA), that\r\n\nprecipitated internecine warfare.   In the  fall of 1990,  Scott-\r\n\nHarris  learned  that   Biltcliffe  had  been   making  offensive\r\n\ncomments.   In  one  instance, referring  to her  co-worker Paula\r\n\nGousie and  to Scott-Harris,  Biltcliffe remarked:   \"That little\r\n\nFrench  bitch has her  head up that  nigger's ass.\"   In another,\r\n\nBiltcliffe  referred to  a secretary  as \"a little  black bitch.\"\r\n\nScott-Harris spoke out against this racist invective and, because\r\n\nCOA operated  under her  general supervision, she  consulted with\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nConnors and then drew up a set of charges against Biltcliffe as a\r\n\nprelude to dismissal.\r\n\n          The  pendency  of   these  charges   did  not   improve\r\n\nBiltcliffe's manners;  she  called Scott-Harris  \"a black  nigger\r\n\nbitch\"  and  warned that  there  would  be repercussions  because\r\n\nBiltcliffe \"knew  people.\"   Biltcliffe  unabashedly pressed  her\r\n\ncase with two city councilors (Roderick and Raymond Mitchell) and\r\n\na  state senator who, in  turn, called Roderick.   After numerous\r\n\npostponements the City  held a hearing  on March 27, 1991.   This\r\n\nresulted in a settlement under which Biltcliffe agreed to  accept\r\n\na 60-day suspension without pay.  Mayor Daniel Bogan subsequently\r\n\nintervened and pared the punishment substantially.\r\n\n          During this  time frame  the  City's financial  outlook\r\n\nworsened.   Municipal officials anticipated that  state aid would\r\n\ndecline up to 10%  in the next fiscal year (July 1,  1991 to June\r\n\n30, 1992).   Mayor Bogan  directed Connors  to prepare a  list of\r\n\nproposed budget cuts to  accommodate the anticipated reduction in\r\n\nfunding.   Connors asked  his department heads,  including Scott-\r\n\nHarris, for  their input.  Scott-Harris  recommended reducing the\r\n\nhours of school nurses.  Bogan rejected this suggestion and, over\r\n\nConnors'  objection,  insisted  that  Scott-Harris'  position  be\r\n\neliminated.\r\n\n          Because  the   post  had  been  created   by  municipal\r\n\nordinance,  its   abolition  necessitated  the   same  procedural\r\n\nformalities.  The City  Charter requires the votes of  a majority\r\n\nof the  nine members of the  City Council for passage  of such an\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nordinance.   The mayor often submits proposed  legislation to the\r\n\nCity Council,  and, in  addition, he  must approve  every enacted\r\n\nordinance  (or  else the  Council must  override  his veto).   In\r\n\nFebruary  1991 Bogan  asked the  Council to  do away  with Scott-\r\n\nHarris' position.  On March 5 the ordinance committee, chaired by\r\n\nRoderick,  reported  out  an  emendatory  ordinance  designed  to\r\n\nachieve  this end and recommended its passage.  Three weeks later\r\n\nthe  City  Council voted  six-to-two  (Roderick  voting with  the\r\n\nmajority) to  approve the position-elimination ordinance.   Bogan\r\n\nsigned it into law.\r\n\n          At  about the  same time  that he  moved to  incinerate\r\n\nScott-Harris'  job, Bogan  offered  her a  different portfolio   \r\n\nPublic Health  Director    which paid approximately  $12,000 less\r\n\nper annum.    Scott-Harris accepted  the  offer by  letter  dated\r\n\nFebruary 28,  1991, but a  follow-up communiqu  from  Bogan added\r\n\nextra duties and shifted Scott-Harris to a less desirable office.\r\n\nDisappointed,  Scott-Harris  drafted a  letter rejecting  the job\r\n\noffer.   That letter mysteriously  arrived at the  mayor's office\r\n\nand was  acted upon  by  Bogan despite  Scott-Harris' efforts  to\r\n\nretract it.   Scott-Harris' tour of  duty with the City  ended on\r\n\nMarch  29,  1991    two  days  after  the  hearing  that  led  to\r\n\nBiltcliffe's suspension.  She filed suit several months later.\r\n\nII.  THE LITIGATION\r          II.  THE LITIGATION\r\n\n          Solon, the fabled  Greek legislator, once characterized\r\n\nthe best type of city as one \"in which those who are not wronged,\r\n\nno  less than those who  are wronged, exert  themselves to punish\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthe  wrongdoers.\"   Plutarch,  Plutarch's  Lives 455  (Bernadotte\r                                                          \r\n\nPerrin trans., 1914).  Here, the plaintiff's complaint alleged in\r\n\nsubstance that the City and certain municipal officials2 inverted\r\n\nthe Solonic ideal:   when the plaintiff responded forcefully (but\r\n\nappropriately) to Biltcliffe's racial slurs, the defendants sided\r\n\nwith the  wrongdoer and instead punished  Scott-Harris by ousting\r\n\nher from her  position under  a blatant pretext.   The  plaintiff\r\n\nalleged  that, in  so doing,  the  defendants abridged  her First\r\n\nAmendment  rights and  set the  stage for  redress under  section\r\n\n1983.  See Mt. Healthy City Sch.

The\r\n\nplaintiff disagreed,  contending that racial animus  and a desire\r\n\nto punish  her for  protected speech, not  budgetary constraints,\r\n\nspurred  the introduction and passage  of the ordinance.   On May\r\n\n26,  1994,  evidently persuaded  by  the  plaintiff's efforts  to\r\n\nconnect Dot to her dismissal, the jury returned a verdict against\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The  plaintiff  originally sued  a plethora  of defendants.\r\nShe quickly narrowed  the field to Connors,  Roderick, Bogan, and\r\nthe City.  During the ensuing trial, the judge directed a verdict\r\nin  Connors' favor.  The plaintiff has not contested that ruling,\r\nand  we discuss these appeals as if Bogan, Roderick, and the City\r\nwere the sole defendants.\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nall three defendants.3\r\n\n          The  verdict form  memorialized the  jury's conclusions\r\n\n(1) that the plaintiff's  constitutionally protected speech was a\r\n\nsubstantial  or motivating  factor  both in  Bogan's decision  to\r\n\nrecommend enactment  of the ordinance and  in Roderick's decision\r\n\nto work for its  passage, and (2) that these  actions proximately\r\n\ncaused  the  extirpation  of the  HHS  director's  position.   As\r\n\noriginally  returned,  the  verdict form  added  an  inconvenient\r\n\nwrinkle;  it indicated that the plaintiff had not proven that the\r\n\nCity's  professed desire  to  enact the  ordinance for  budgetary\r\n\nreasons was pretextual.   Out  of the jury's  earshot, the  judge\r\n\nexpressed her  concern that  the jury's findings  were internally\r\n\ninconsistent.   After a brief  colloquy, she resubmitted the case\r\n\nto the jury with  appropriate supplemental instructions.  Shortly\r\n\nthereafter  the  jury  returned  a  revised  verdict  form  which\r\n\nreiterated everything except the  \"no pretext\" finding.   In that\r\n\nwise,  the jury,  having reconsidered  the matter,  now concluded\r\n\nthat  the  City's  stated  reason for  wanting  the  ordinance   \r\n\nbudgetary concerns   was not its true reason.\r\n\n          The  jury  assessed  compensatory  damages  against all\r\n\nthree  defendants,  jointly  and  severally,  in  the  amount  of\r\n\n$156,000;  found Bogan liable for  punitive damages in the amount\r\n\nof $60,000; and found Roderick liable for punitive damages in the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The  jury   found  against   the  plaintiff  on   her  race\r\ndiscrimination claim, and she does not contest that finding here.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\namount  of   $15,000.4     The  court  subsequently   denied  the\r\n\ndefendants' motions  for  judgment notwithstanding  the  verdict.\r\n\nThese appeals followed   but not without a  perturbing procedural\r\n\nprelude.\r\n\nIII.  THE NOTICES OF APPEAL\r          III.  THE NOTICES OF APPEAL\r\n\n          Rule  4(a)(1)  of  the   Federal  Rules  of   Appellate\r\n\nProcedure  requires that  notices of  appeal  \"be filed  with the\r\n\nclerk  of the  district court within  30 days  after the  date of\r\n\nentry of the judgment  or order appealed from.\"   Compliance with\r\n\nthis  rule is  mandatory and  jurisdictional; while  a court  may\r\n\nconstrue  the rule's  strictures  liberally, it  may not  wink at\r\n\nthem.

One such exception,\r\n\nadded to the Appellate Rules in 1991, provides:\r\n\n          The district  court, if  it finds (a)  that a\r\n          party entitled  to notice  of the entry  of a\r\n          judgment or order did not receive such notice\r\n          from the clerk or any party within 21 days of\r\n          its  entry and  (b)  that no  party would  be\r\n          prejudiced, may, upon motion filed within 180\r\n          days  of entry  of the  judgment or  order or\r\n          within  7  days of  receipt  of  such notice,\r\n          whichever  is  earlier, reopen  the  time for\r\n          appeal for a period of 14 days from  the date\r\n          of the entry of  the order reopening the time\r\n          for appeal.\r\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6).  The mention of \"notice\" in Rule 4(a)(6)\r\n\nis a reference to Fed. R. Civ. P. 77(d), which provides:\r\n\n          Immediately  upon the  entry of  an order  or\r\n          judgment the  clerk shall serve  a notice  of\r\n          entry by  mail in the manner  provided for in\r\n          Rule 5 upon  each party who is not in default\r\n          for failure to appear,  and shall make a note\r\n          in the docket of the mailing.   Any party may\r\n          in addition  serve a notice of  such entry in\r\n          the manner provided in Rule 5 for the service\r\n          of papers.   Lack of  notice of the  entry by\r\n          the clerk does not  affect the time to appeal\r\n          or  relieve or authorize the court to relieve\r\n          a party for failure to appeal within the time\r\n          allowed, except  as permitted in Rule 4(a) of\r\n          the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.\r\n\n          These  rules lie  at the  center of  the jurisdictional\r\n\njumble  that  confronts us.    On  the defendants'  motions,  the\r\n\ndistrict court held a hearing and determined that Fed. R. App. P.\r\n\n4(a)(6) appropriately could be  invoked to excuse the defendants'\r\n\nseeming tardiness.  The  plaintiff's cross-appeal challenges this\r\n\ndetermination.  Because Rule  4(a)(6) is relatively new, we  have\r\n\nnot yet had occasion to construe it.  We do so today, deciding at\r\n\nthe outset that the standard of review which governs a district's\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\ncourt's determinations under Rule 4(a)(6) is abuse of discretion.\r\n\nAccord Nunley  v.

Thus,\r\n\nthe  decisive  questions  in  this  case  relate  to  whether the\r\n\ndefendants  received notice of the  entry of the  order within 21\r\n\ndays, and if not,  whether they filed their Rule  4(a)(6) motions\r\n\nwithin  seven days of the time when they eventually received such\r\n\nnotice.\r\n\n          Both of these questions  involve an appreciation of the\r\n\nkind  of notice that Rule  4(a)(6) contemplates.   In terms, Rule\r\n\n4(a)(6)  advances a unitary concept of notice; its two references\r\n\nto \"such notice\" plainly relate back to the phrase \"notice of the\r\n\nentry of a judgment or order.\"   The problem, exemplified by this\r\n\ncase, is that the rule does not specify whether that  notice must\r\n\nbe written notice or  actual notice.

Here, they tell us that Rule 4(a)(6)\r\n\n          provides a limited opportunity for  relief in\r\n          circumstances where the notice of  entry of a\r\n          judgment or order, required  to be mailed  by\r\n          the  clerk of the  district court pursuant to\r\n          [Rule  77(d)], is  either not  received by  a\r\n          party or is received so late as to impair the\r\n          opportunity  to  file  a  timely   notice  of\r\n          appeal.\r\n\nFed.  R.  App.  P.  4(a)(6), Advisory  Committee's  Notes.    The\r\n\nstatement \"required to be mailed\" refers to \"notice of entry of a\r\n\njudgment or order,\" again  suggesting that the notice must  be in\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nwriting.  We believe that when a procedural rule uses the precise\r\n\nphrase employed by  the Advisory Committee, it  can reasonably be\r\n\ninferred that the phrase means the same thing in both contexts.\r\n\n          Policy  concerns  point  us  in  the   same  direction.\r\n\nReading  Rule 4(a)(6)  to  require written  notice will  simplify\r\n\nfuture  proceedings.   As  the familiar  request  to \"put  it  in\r\n\nwriting\" suggests, writings are more readily susceptible to proof\r\n\nthan  oral communications.  In particular, the receipt of written\r\n\nnotice (or its  absence) should be more  easily demonstrable than\r\n\nattempting to discern whether (and, if so, when) a party received\r\n\nactual  notice.    Such a  scheme  not  only  takes  much of  the\r\n\nguesswork  out of  the  equation, but  also,  because Rule  77(d)\r\n\nspecifically provides that parties  who do not wish to  rely upon\r\n\nthe  clerk to  transmit the  requisite written  notice may  do so\r\n\nthemselves,  the  scheme  confers  certitude  without  leaving  a\r\n\nvictorious litigant at the mercy of a slipshod clerk.\r\n\n          To sum up, we  hold that written notice is  required to\r\n\ntrigger  the  relevant  time  period  under  Rule  4(a)(6);  oral\r\n\ncommunications or other  forms of actual  notice will not  serve.\r\n\nWe now apply this holding to the facts at hand.\r\n\n          The district  court found  that the defendants  did not\r\n\nreceive  written notice of the entry of the operative order until\r\n\nApril  7, 1995, when the  plaintiff's counsel sent  them a demand\r\n\nletter  seeking satisfaction  of the  judgments.  The  court made\r\n\nthis  finding  against  a  backdrop  of   unusual  events.    The\r\n\ndefendants' motions for judgment  n.o.v. were argued on September\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n29, 1994.  During that session, an unrecorded sidebar  conference\r\n\noccurred.   The  court's  comments at  that  conference left  all\r\n\ncounsel  with the  distinct impression  that an  appealable final\r\n\njudgment would not  enter until the court decided the plaintiff's\r\n\npending application for attorneys' fees.

The\r\n\nplaintiff's lawyer,  no less than defense  counsel, labored under\r\n\nthe  misimpression; he wrote to  the defense team  on February 2,\r\n\n1995,  stating  in  relevant  part:    \"I  received  the  Court's\r\n\nmemorandum  and order on the defendants' motion for J.N.O.V.  The\r\n\nonly  remaining  issue  before  judgment can  be  entered  is the\r                                                                   \r\n\nplaintiff's  unopposed  motion  for attorney's  fees.\"  (Emphasis\r\n\nsupplied).\r\n\n          Unbeknownst  to  the parties,  however,  the  court had\r\n\ngranted the plaintiff's motion for  attorneys' fees in late 1994.\r\n\nThe  clerk  entered this  order  on the  docket  but, apparently,\r\n\nneglected to serve  copies of the  order or the  docket entry  on\r\n\ncounsel.   To  complicate matters  further, when  defense counsel\r\n\nmade  inquiries to the clerk in February  and March of 1995 as to\r\n\nwhether  an  order  had  been   entered  disposing  of  the   fee\r\n\napplication, the clerk said that one had not.\r\n\n          Last  but not least, although all counsel in one way or\r\n\nanother  had  actual   notice  of  the  order  that   denied  the\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\ndefendants'  motions for  judgment  n.o.v. by  February 1,  1995,\r\n\ncases discussing Rule 4(a)(6)  differentiate between notice of an\r\n\norder and notice of the  entry of the order, indicating that  the\r\n\nrule contemplates  the latter.   See  Virella-Nieves v.

In this\r                        \r\n\ninstance the clerk attempted to furnish such notice, but one copy\r\n\nof the court's  order was addressed  incorrectly and returned  by\r\n\nthe  Post Office as undeliverable, while another copy, plucked by\r\n\na different lawyer from the clerk's office, bore no notation that\r\n\nit had been entered on the docket.  From this  tangled record the\r\n\ndistrict  court  concluded  that,  though at  least  one  defense\r\n\nattorney  received actual  notice of  the entry  of the  order on\r\n\nFebruary 24, 1995,5  it was not  until April 7,  1995   when  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  attorney demanded  satisfaction of  the  judgments  \r\n\nthat  the  defendants received  a  written  notice sufficient  to\r\n\nanimate Rule 4(a)(6).  They filed their excusatory motions within\r\n\nseven days of their receipt of this notice.\r\n\n          Given these facts, and given the confused circumstances\r\n\nthat  contributed to the muddle, the district court did not abuse\r\n\nits discretion in  finding that the requirements  of Rule 4(a)(6)\r\n\nhad been  met and in  reopening the time  for appeal.   Since the\r\n\ndefendants all filed  their notices of  appeal within the  14-day\r\n\nperiod  that began on August  14, 1995, when  Judge Saris entered\r\n\nher  order reopening the time for doing  so, we conclude that the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5We note, parenthetically, that  even this notice came after\r\nthe 21-day period specified by Rule 4(a)(6) had elapsed.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nappeals are properly before us.\r\n\nIV.  THE VERDICT FORM\r          IV.  THE VERDICT FORM\r\n\n          The  defendants collectively  assert that  the district\r\n\ncourt erred in refusing to declare a mistrial when presented with\r\n\nthe  original  verdict  form  and added  impudence  to  injury by\r\n\nresubmitting the  case for further  deliberation.  We  review the\r\n\ndistrict court's denial of the defendants' motions for a mistrial\r\n\nfor abuse  of discretion.   See Clemente  v. Carnicon-P.R.  Mgmt.\r                                                                           \r\n\nAssocs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196018\"><a href=\"/opinion/196018/clemente-v-carnicon-management/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  388  (1st Cir.  1995).   We evaluate  the\r                 \r\n\njudge's  related actions,  namely,  her decisions  to reject  the\r\n\noriginal  verdict form and to resubmit the matter, under the same\r\n\nstandard of  review.   See Santiago-Negron v.  Castro-Davila, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"516909\"><a href=\"/opinion/516909/ivette-santiago-negron-v-modesto-castro-davila-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span>\r                                                                      \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\n\n          The defendants' argument on this point boils  down to a\r\n\nclaim that the  district court  crafted a verdict  form that  was\r\n\nstructurally flawed; that the  jury responded to it  by returning\r\n\ntwo  irreconcilable  findings; and  that, therefore,  Judge Saris\r\n\nshould  have granted the defendants' motions for a mistrial.  But\r\n\nit  is not enough to  preserve the defendants'  point that, after\r\n\nthe jury  first returned  with the  verdict form,  the defendants\r\n\npounced  on the  perceived  inconsistency and  moved to  pass the\r\n\ncase.   Rather, the viability  of this assignment  of error harks\r\n\nback  to  the  circumstances  surrounding the  emergence  of  the\r\n\nverdict  form.   Although the  defendants now  say that  the form\r\n\ntempted potential confusion, they failed to object when the judge\r\n\ninitially submitted it to the jury.  The failure to object to the\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nstructure of a  verdict form  before the jury  retires, like  the\r\n\nfailure to object  to any  other portion of  the judge's  charge,\r\n\nconstitutes  a waiver.

P. 51; see also Phav v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nTrueblood,  Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548929\"><a href=\"/opinion/548929/chat-phav-v-trueblood-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">764</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 769 (1st Cir. 1990) (holding that\r                          \r\n\nRule 51  applies to verdict forms as well as to the trial court's\r\n\noral instructions);  Anderson v.

This is exactly the  course of action\r\n\nthat  Judge Saris  followed.   The  actual instructions  that she\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\ngave,  first orally  and then  in  a written  response to  a jury\r\n\nquestion,  were   unimpugnable.6     We  discern  no   error,  no\r\n\nunfairness,  and no  abuse  of discretion  either in  the judge's\r\n\nhandling  of matters related to the verdict form or in her denial\r\n\nof the defendants' motions for a mistrial.\r\n\nV.  MUNICIPAL LIABILITY\r          V.  MUNICIPAL LIABILITY\r\n\n          We  turn  now to  the  City's  principal assignment  of\r\n\nerror.   Clearly, a municipality may be held liable under section\r\n\n1983   for  the  passage  of  a  single  ordinance  or  piece  of\r\n\nlegislation.   See, e.g., Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111615\"><a href=\"/opinion/111615/pembaur-v-cincinnati/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r                                                                 \r\n\n<span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 480 (1986).  Although municipal liability cannot be based on\r\n\nthe doctrine of respondeat superior in this context,  see Monell,\r                                                                          \r\n\n436 U.S. at 691, such liability can flow from a  finding that the\r\n\ncity  itself  has  acted  through  an  official decision  of  its\r\n\nlegislative body.7  Hence,  from a purely theoretical standpoint,\r\n\nnothing prevents a determination  that, if the ordinance  here in\r\n\nquestion    which was passed by a majority vote of the Fall River\r\n\nCity Council and approved by the mayor   violates the plaintiff's\r\n\nFirst Amendment rights, then the City is liable for the violation\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6Neither  Bogan nor  Roderick  voiced any  objection to  the\r\ncourt's supplemental instructions.   The lone objection lodged by\r\nthe City  challenged the  judge's interchanging of  \"real reason\"\r\nand  \"true reason\"  during  her supplemental  instructions.   The\r\njudge understandably dismissed this  objection as nitpicking, and\r\nthe City (wisely, in our view) has not resuscitated it on appeal.\r\n\n     7Such  a  decision  can  be manifested  either  through  the\r\nenactment  of an ordinance or through the adoption of a municipal\r\npolicy.  See, e.g., Pembaur, 475 U.S. at 479-81; Monell, 436 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\nat 690.  Thus, adoption-of-policy cases are pertinent to a survey\r\nof enactment-of-ordinance cases.\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nunder section 1983.\r\n\n          We pause at this juncture.  We think it is important to\r\n\nnote  early  on  that  the  defendants  have  not challenged  the\r\n\npremise, or the district judge's confirmatory ruling, that Scott-\r\n\nHarris'  speech was protected by the First Amendment in the sense\r\n\nneeded  to give  rise to  a claim  under section  1983.   Yet the\r\n\nSupreme Court has laid down important restrictions:  to give rise\r\n\nto a section 1983 action, a  plaintiff's speech must have been on\r\n\na  matter  of public  concern,  and  her interest  in  expressing\r\n\nherself  must  not  be  outweighed  by  the  state's  interest as\r\n\nemployer  in promoting  the efficiency  of the  services that  it\r\n\nperforms.

We do\r\n\nnot pursue  this point because it  has not been argued  to us; it\r\n\nhas, therefore, effectively been waived.  We mention it, however,\r\n\nbecause we do not intend our opinion to be taken as deciding that\r\n\nthe facts here asserted comprise protected speech.\r\n\n          We note, moreover, that  there is another unusual twist\r\n\nto this  case.   In  most similar  instances, the  constitutional\r\n\ndeprivation is apparent on  the face of the  ordinance or in  the\r\n\ntext  of the  challenged municipal  policy, thus  eliminating any\r\n\nneed for  a  predicate inquiry  into  the motives  of  individual\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nlegislators.

In\r\n\ncases  like this one, implicating the exercise of First Amendment\r\n\nrights, liability under section 1983 can attach to the passage of\r\n\na  facially  benign law  only if  one  peers beneath  the textual\r\n\nfacade and concludes  that the  legislative body acted  out of  a\r\n\nconstitutionally  impermissible  motive.

Though  the  city's\r\nliability derived from the  actions of a 12-member city  council,\r\nthe court focused  almost exclusively on statements  by the mayor\r\n(who  had only one vote on the council) and race-based opposition\r\nexpressed by  a few other councilors.   The court did not premise\r\nits  decision on a requirement that a majority of the council had\r\nacted out of impermissible motives.\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\ncourt upheld a finding of liability based on this evidence and on\r\n\nstatements by  three other  committee members that  the plaintiff\r\n\nhad  been a  victim of  discrimination and/or  had been  the best\r\n\nqualified candidate for the job.

On the one hand, because a\r\n\nmunicipal ordinance can become law only by a majority vote of the\r\n\ncity  council, there is  a certain incongruity  in allowing fewer\r\n\nthan a majority  of the council  members to subject  the city  to\r\n\nliability  under  section  1983.    On  the  other  hand, because\r\n\ndiscriminatory animus  is insidious and  a clever pretext  can be\r\n\nhard to  unmask, the law sometimes  constructs procedural devices\r\n\nto ease a victim's burden of proof.

Where,  as here, a plaintiff alleges that a\r\n\ncity's  councilors connived  to victimize  her by  the pretextual\r\n\npassage  of  a  facially  neutral ordinance,  it  may  be  overly\r\n\nmechanistic  to  hold  her  to  strict  proof  of the  subjective\r\n\nintentions of a numerical majority of council members.\r\n\n          Cognizant of  these competing  concerns, we  eschew for\r\n\nthe  time  being  a bright-line  rule.    Rather,  we assume  for\r\n\nargument's  sake  (but  do not  decide)  that  in a  sufficiently\r\n\ncompelling  case the  requirement  that the  plaintiff prove  bad\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nmotive  on  the  part  of  a  majority  of  the  members  of  the\r\n\nlegislative body might  be relaxed and a  proxy accepted instead.\r\n\nNevertheless,  any such  relaxation  would be  contingent on  the\r\n\nplaintiff mustering evidence of  both (a) bad motive on  the part\r\n\nof  at  least  a  significant   bloc  of  legislators,  and   (b)\r\n\ncircumstances suggesting  the probable complicity of  others.  By\r\n\nway of illustration, evidence of procedural anomalies, acquiesced\r\n\nin by  a majority of  the legislative  body, may support  such an\r\n\ninference.   See, e.g., City  of Birmingham, 727  F.2d at 564-65;\r                                                     \r\n\nTown of Clarkton, 682 F.2d at  1066-67.

The key is  likelihood:  Has\r                    \r\n\nthe  plaintiff  proffered  evidence,  direct  or  circumstantial,\r\n\nwhich, when reasonable  inferences are drawn in  her favor, makes\r\n\nit  appear  more  probable  (i.e.,  more  likely  than  not) that\r\n\ndiscrimination was  the real  reason underlying the  enactment of\r\n\nthe ordinance or the adoption of the policy?\r\n\n          The  facts of this case  do not require  that we refine\r\n\nthe  point  to any  further extent.    Scott-Harris has  not only\r\n\nfailed to prove that a majority of the councilors possessed a bad\r\n\nmotive, but she also has failed  to furnish enough circumstantial\r\n\nevidence  to ground  a  finding that,  more  likely than  not,  a\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\ndiscriminatory animus propelled the City Council's action.\r\n\n          The evidence, viewed most hospitably to the plaintiff,9\r\n\nreveals  that six of  the nine councilors  voted in  favor of the\r\n\nchallenged ordinance and two opposed it.  The plaintiff presented\r\n\nsufficient  evidence from which a  jury could deduce  that one of\r\n\nthese  six, Roderick, along with Mayor  Bogan (who did not have a\r\n\nvote), acted  out of a bad motive.10  The plaintiff also produced\r\n\nsome glancing  evidence apropos  of Councilor Mitchell:   he  and\r\n\nRoderick  were   friends;  Roderick   spoke  to  him   about  the\r\n\nBiltcliffe/Scott-Harris  imbroglio;  and  Biltcliffe called  him,\r\n\npresumably to protest her  treatment.  The jury could  have found\r\n\nfrom other evidence in  the case that Mitchell probably  voted in\r\n\nfavor of the  ordinance (although the  record does not  eliminate\r\n\nthe possibility that he abstained).  Even though Mitchell did not\r\n\ntestify and  the substance of his conversations with Roderick and\r\n\nBiltcliffe are unknown, we assume arguendo that a jury reasonably\r\n\ncould infer that Mitchell, too, acted for a proscribed reason.\r\n\n          The  remaining  gaps  in  the  plaintiff's   proof  are\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     9On the  question of  evidentiary sufficiency, we  review de\r\nnovo  the denial of the City's motion for judgment n.o.v.

None of the other seven\r\n\ncity council  members uttered any untoward  statements or engaged\r\n\nin  any suspicious  actions.   The  \"we  must slash  the  budget\"\r\n\npretext  had a ring of plausibility, and from aught that appears,\r\n\nnone of these  seven individuals had any way of  knowing that the\r\n\nposition-elimination ordinance  would not  save  the City  sorely\r\n\nneeded funds.   Nor is  there strong  circumstantial evidence  of\r\n\ncomplicity;  indeed, the record tells us almost nothing about the\r\n\ninclinations of the silent seven.11  Moreover, the plaintiff made\r\n\nvirtually no effort to adduce such evidence.  She neither deposed\r\n\nany of the seven nor called them as witnesses at trial.  She  did\r\n\nnot  attempt to show  that any of  the other four  councilors who\r\n\nvoted  for the ordinance had any basis  for doubting the truth of\r\n\nthe  party line  (\"we  must  slash  the  budget\")  or  that  they\r\n\npossessed ties to Roderick  or Bogan, or that they  were beholden\r\n\nto  Biltcliffe, or that they  were hostile to  Scott-Harris.  The\r\n\nstark fact is that the motivations of the council members   other\r\n\nthan  Roderick  and Mitchell     did  not receive  individualized\r\n\nscrutiny.   By  any  responsible standard,  this sparse  evidence\r\n\nfalls  short of  providing a  proper predicate  for a  finding of\r\n\nmunicipal liability.\r\n\n          We  do  not think  it is  a  coincidence that  in every\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     11The  record does  show that  one council member  who voted\r\nagainst the  ordinance, John  Medeiros, called the  plaintiff and\r\nasked  why  \"they\" were  trying  to  get rid  of  her.   But  the\r\nplaintiff provided no  insight into  who \"they\" might  be and  no\r\nevidence  that \"they\" comprised a majority, or even a significant\r\nbloc, of the City Council.\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nanalogous case  in which municipal liability has  been imposed on\r\n\nevidence implicating less than a  majority of a legislative body,\r\n\nsubstantial  circumstantial  evidence   existed  from  which  the\r\n\nrequisite discriminatory animus  could be inferred.   In City  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nBirmingham, the evidence showed that the race-based opposition of\r                    \r\n\nconstituents  to integrated  housing was  widespread, pronounced,\r\n\nand  vociferously  articulated.     After  several  members   who\r\n\nsupported the  racially integrated  development were  ousted from\r\n\noffice, the commission responded to this unremitting pressure and\r\n\ntook  the  unprecedented step  of  submitting the  proposal  to a\r\n\ncommunity referendum.  538 F. Supp. at 826-29.  In Yonkers Bd. of\r                                                                           \r\n\nEduc.,  the  requisite inference  was  supported  by evidence  of\r               \r\n\nmassive constituent agitation  as well as by \"departures from the\r\n\nnormal  procedural  sequence\"  in   respect  to  the   challenged\r\n\nproposal.  837 F.2d at 1221. \r\n\n          In this case no such evidence exists.  Nothing suggests\r\n\nthe  City Council  deviated from  its  standard protocol  when it\r\n\nreceived and enacted the ordinance that abolished the plaintiff's\r\n\njob.  Nothing suggests that the  vote took place in an atmosphere\r\n\npermeated   by  widespread   constituent  pressure.12     Putting\r\n\nspeculation and surmise to one side, it simply cannot be inferred\r\n\nthat more than  two of the council  members who voted to  abolish\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12The plaintiff's assertion  that the publication of  front-\r\npage  articles about  her  plight in  the  local newspaper  shows\r\nconstituent  coercion  will not  wash.   There  is  a significant\r\ndifference between heightened public  interest   an environmental\r\nphenomenon  with  which  legislatures  grapple  constantly    and\r\npervasive constituent pressure.\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nthe  plaintiff's  position did  so  to punish  her  for protected\r\n\nspeech.    We  cannot rest  municipal  liability  on  so frail  a\r\n\nfoundation.   Because no reasonable  jury could find  against the\r\n\nCity  on the proof presented, Fall River's motion for judgment as\r\n\na matter of law should have been granted.\r\n\nVI.  INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY\r          VI.  INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY\r\n\n          Roderick and Bogan advance a different constellation of\r\n\narguments in support  of their  motions for judgment  n.o.v.

We reaffirm today that the shield of legislative immunity\r\n\nlies within reach of city officials.\r\n\n          This  holding  does  not  end our  inquiry.    Although\r\n\nlegislative   immunity   is  absolute   within   certain  limits,\r\n\nlegislators  are not immune with respect to all actions that they\r\n\ntake.   The dividing line  is drawn along  a functional axis that\r\n\ndistinguishes between  legislative and administrative acts.   The\r\n\nformer are protected,  the latter are not.   See Acevedo-Cordero,\r                                                                          \r\n\n958F.2d at 23. We have useda pair of testsfor separating the two:\r\n\n          The first  test focuses on the  nature of the\r\n          facts used  to reach the given  decision.  If\r\n          the underlying facts on which the decision is\r\n          based  are  \"legislative   facts,\"  such   as\r\n          \"generalizations concerning a policy or state\r\n          of   affairs,\"   then    the   decision    is\r\n          legislative.    If  the  facts  used  in  the\r\n          decision  making are  more specific,  such as\r\n          those that relate  to particular  individuals\r\n          or   situations,   then   the   decision   is\r\n          administrative.

When the material facts are\r                             \r\n\ngenuinely disputed, however, the  question is properly treated as\r\n\na question of  fact, and  its disposition must  await the  trial.\r\n\nSee id.\r                 \r\n\n          In some  ways, Acevedo-Cordero  and this case  are fair\r                                                  \r\n\ncongeners.    There,  as   here,  the  defendants  asserted  that\r\n\nbudgetary  woes  sparked  the  enactment  of  a  facially  benign\r\n\nposition-elimination ordinance.  There, as here, the plaintiff(s)\r\n\ncountered  with  a  charge  that,  in  fact,  a  constitutionally\r\n\nproscribed reason lurked  beneath the surface.   There, as  here,\r\n\nconflicted  evidence as  to the  defendants' true  motives raised\r\n\ngenuine issues of material fact.  Acevedo-Cordero teaches that in\r                                                           \r\n\nsuch  situations the issue of  immunity must be  reserved for the\r\n\ntrial.  See id.\r                         \r\n\n          Judge   Saris   faithfully  applied   these  teachings,\r\n\nrefusing   to  reward  premature   attempts  by   the  individual\r\n\ndefendants  to dismiss  the action  on  the basis  of legislative\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n\nimmunity.  At  the end of  the trial, the  jury made two  crucial\r\n\nfindings.  First, it found that the defendants' stated reason for\r\n\nenacting the position-elimination  ordinance was  not their  real\r\n\nreason.   Second, it found that  the plaintiff's constitutionally\r\n\nsheltered  speech was a  substantial or motivating  factor in the\r\n\nactions which  Roderick and  Bogan took vis- -vis  the ordinance.\r\n\nThese  findings reflect  the  jury's belief  that the  individual\r\n\ndefendants  relied on facts relating to a particular individual  \r\n\nScott-Harris    in  the  decisionmaking calculus  and devised  an\r\n\nordinance that targeted Scott-Harris and  treated her differently\r\n\nfrom other managers employed by the City.\r\n\n          We think that in  passing on the individual defendants'\r\n\npost-trial motions,  the judge in effect  accepted these findings\r\n\nand concluded  that  the position-elimination  ordinance  (which,\r\n\nafter  all, constituted  no  more in  this  case than  the  means\r\n\nemployed by Scott-Harris' antagonists to fire her) constituted an\r\n\nadministrative rather than  a legislative  act.  As  long as  the\r\n\nquantum of proof  suffices   a matter to which  we shall return  \r\n\nboth this conclusion and its natural corollary (that Roderick and\r\n\nBogan  are  not  shielded  from liability  by  operation  of  the\r\n\ndoctrine of  legislative immunity) rest on  solid legal ground.14\r\n\nSee, e.g., Negron-Gaztambide v.

She posits\r\n\nthat, as a matter of law, her actions in respect to the position-\r\n\nelimination ordinance cannot be deemed the proximate cause of the\r\n\nharm to  Scott-Harris.15  She bases  this claim on the  fact that\r\n\nher vote alone was impuissant:  five votes would ensure enactment\r\n\nof the ordinance, but  six legislators voted for passage.   Thus,\r\n\nnot only was she unable to get  the ordinance enacted by herself,\r\n\nbut it also would have been passed without her cooperation.

After all, Roderick  was\r\n\nnot just another face in the crowd:  she served as vice-president\r\n\nof the City  Council and  chaired its ordinance  committee; as  a\r\n\nresult, the jury easily could find that she played a  role in the\r\n\npassage of the ordinance that was disproportionate  to her single\r\n\nvote.  In order to gain approval, the ordinance had to go through\r\n\nthe five-member ordinance committee.   Roderick established  this\r\n\ncommittee's agenda, and  its favorable report on March  5 cleared\r\n\nthe way for the ordinance's enactment.17\r\n\n          Although the plaintiff's evidence in this regard is not\r\n\nrobust, it  suffices in the context  of the record as  a whole to\r\n\nrender the issue of causation susceptible to differing evaluative\r\n\ndeterminations.    Thus,  the  district  judge  did  not  err  in\r\n\nsubmitting the causation question  to the jury.

This assertion is easily refuted.\r\n\n          In challenging a jury verdict on sufficiency grounds, a\r\n\ndefendant  labors under  a  heavy  burden.    See  supra  note  9\r                                                                  \r\n\n(elucidating  applicable   legal  standard  and   citing  cases).\r\n\nBecause  the evidence in this  case is capable  of supporting two\r\n\nsets  of divergent  inferences, Roderick  and Bogan  cannot carry\r\n\ntheir burden.\r\n\n          We choose not  to tarry.  It  suffices to say  that, on\r\n\nthis pleochroic record, the jury could have found that Biltcliffe\r\n\nused political connections to  hinder the investigation of Scott-\r\n\nHarris' accusations  by, inter  alia, banishing the  accuser, and\r                                              \r\n\nthat  Roderick and Bogan  were the instruments  of her vengeance.\r\n\nRoderick bore an animosity toward Scott-Harris based on a history\r\n\nof friction between the two women, and the jury permissibly could\r\n\nhave  found that when  Biltcliffe complained to  her about Scott-\r\n\nHarris'  charges, she  spoke to  Connors; that  when Scott-Harris\r\n\npersisted,  Roderick  agreed  to  push  the  position-elimination\r\n\nordinance despite  the fact that Scott-Harris  was performing her\r\n\nduties well; that the asserted budgetary basis for  the ordinance\r\n\nwas a sham;18 and that Roderick knew as much.\r\n\n          As to Bogan, much of the same evidence is relevant.  In\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     18On this point, the evidence permitted the jury to conclude\r\nthat,   rather  than   saving  money,   the  position-elimination\r\nordinance actually  cost more because it  necessitated the hiring\r\nof three new administrators to manage agencies that the plaintiff\r\nhad been supervising single-handed.\r\n\n                                36\r\r\n\naddition, the jury could  have found that he knew  Biltcliffe and\r\n\nresented Scott-Harris' outspoken efforts  to cashier her; that he\r\n\nabetted the  effort to save Biltcliffe's  sinecure by terminating\r\n\nScott-Harris (and no other  manager) for a bogus reason;  that he\r\n\nproposed   the  position-elimination   ordinance  to   that  end,\r\n\nnotwithstanding  Connors' opposition;  that he happily  signed it\r\n\ninto  law;  that when  he learned  of Scott-Harris'  intention to\r\n\naccept a  different municipal  position at a  reduced salary,  he\r\n\npulled the rug from under  her by increasing the responsibilities\r\n\nof  the job and shifting her to  a dingy office; that when Scott-\r\n\nHarris  tried  to  retract   her  rejection  of  this  diminished\r\n\nposition, he foiled her efforts to  do so; and that in all events\r\n\nBogan   showed  his   true  colors  by   shortening  Biltcliffe's\r\n\nsuspension.\r\n\n          To  be sure,  this  set of  conclusions  does not  flow\r\n\nineluctably from  the evidence,  but it represents  a permissible\r\n\nconstruction  of  the  record.   Consequently,  the  evidence  is\r\n\nadequate to support the verdicts against both Roderick and Bogan.\r\n\nVII.  ATTORNEYS' FEES\r          VII.

The last leg requires us\r\n\nto  revisit  the  lower  court's  order  awarding  the  plaintiff\r\n\n$83,179.70 in counsel fees  and associated expenses against three\r\n\ndefendants  (Roderick,   Bogan,  and   the  City),   jointly  and\r\n\nseverally.\r\n\n          In a section 1983  action a court, \"in  its discretion,\r\n\nmay  allow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney's fee\r\n\n                                37\r\r\n\nas part  of the costs.\"   42 U.S.C.    1988 (1994).

Moreover, if a plaintiff succeeds in the trial court\r\n\nbut the  judgment she obtains  is reversed  on appeal, she  is no\r\n\nlonger entitled  to a  fee  award.

In\r\n\ntheir  appeals, however, they preserved the issue of whether (and\r\n\n                                38\r\r\n\nto what extent)  the fee  award could withstand  the reversal  on\r\n\nappeal of all  or some  part of the  judgments.  This  precaution\r\n\nserves  the City in good  stead; because the  judgment against it\r\n\nmust be reversed, see supra Part V, the fee award against it must\r                                     \r\n\nbe nullified.\r\n\n          This  leaves a nagging question as to the status of the\r\n\naward  vis- -vis  Roderick  and Bogan.    On  the  one hand,  the\r\n\njudgments against  those two defendants remain  intact, see supra\r                                                                           \r\n\nPart  VI,  and,  thus,  as  to  them,  the  plaintiff  remains  a\r\n\nprevailing  party presumptively entitled to reasonable attorneys'\r\n\nfees.  On the  other hand, the record before  us is opaque as  to\r\n\nthe  proper  extent  of  that  entitlement.    This   opacity  is\r\n\nparticularly  pronounced because we do not know how much (if any)\r\n\nof the work  performed by  the plaintiff's lawyer  in respect  to\r\n\nScott-Harris' unsuccessful claims against  the City paved the way\r\n\nfor  her successful  claims  against  the individual  defendants.\r\n\nThis is  an important datum  because a court  may allow  fees for\r\n\ntime  spent  on unsuccessful  claims  only  if those  claims  are\r\n\nsufficiently linked to successful claims.

From what we have  said to this\r\n\njuncture,  it is apparent  that the matter  of fees must  be more\r\n\nfully  explored   and it  is preferable for  obvious reasons that\r\n\nthe trial court, as opposed to this court, undertake what amounts\r\n\nto an archeological dig  into counsel's time sheets and  make the\r\n\n                                39\r\r\n\nnecessary factual  determinations.   We therefore vacate  the fee\r\n\naward against the City  and remand so that the district court can\r\n\nreconsider the amount of  fees and costs that should  properly be\r\n\nassessed against the remaining defendants.\r\n\n          The plaintiff also has  prevailed on appeal against two\r\n\nof  the defendants, and she  is entitled to  a reasonable counsel\r\n\nfee for  the work  that yielded  this victory.   Though we  often\r\n\nentertain such fee applications directly, we have sometimes opted\r\n\nto have  the district  court  handle them.   See,  e.g., Rodi  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nVentetuolo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566305\"><a href=\"/opinion/566305/stephen-gerard-rodi-v-donald-r-ventetuolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 31 (1st Cir.  1991); see also  1st Cir.\r                                                                 \r\n\nLoc. R. 39.2 (permitting  use of this alternative).   Because the\r\n\ndistrict  court must  in any  event reopen  its inquiry  into the\r\n\noverall  question of fees, we deem it expedient for the plaintiff\r\n\nto file her application for  fees on appeal with that court,  and\r\n\nfor  that court  to make  the supplementary award.   We  leave to\r\n\nJudge Saris the procedure to be  followed on remand in respect to\r\n\nboth   reexamination   of   the   original  award   and   initial\r\n\nconsideration  of the supplementary  award for  services rendered\r\n\nand expenses (apart from ordinary costs) incurred on appeal.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff's cross-appeal  (No. 95-2100)  is denied\r                    The  plaintiff's cross-appeal  (No. 95-2100)  is denied\r                                                                           \r\n\nand the district  court's order permitting  the reopening of  the\r          and the district  court's order permitting  the reopening of  the\r                                                                           \r\n\nappeal period is affirmed.
