John J.  Sullivan, a  New Hampshire  state\r                           \r\n\nprisoner, appeals pro  se from the grant of  summary judgment\r                                     \r\n\nin favor of defendant Martin  Magnusson, former Warden of the\r\n\nMaine State Prison.  We affirm.  \r\n\n     On October 12, 1995,  Sullivan filed a 42 U.S.C.    1983\r\n\ncomplaint seeking damages against  Magnusson for violation of\r\n\nhis rights under  the First Amendment.  The complaint alleges\r\n\nthat  Sullivan was housed  at the Maine  State Prison between\r\n\nSeptember 30,  1988 and  December 16,  1993.   The  complaint\r\n\nfurther  alleges  that  on  the  latter  date,  Sullivan  was\r\n\ntransferred from  the  Maine State  Prison  back to  the  New\r\n\nHampshire State  Prison in retaliation for Sullivan's writing\r\n\na newspaper column for the Maine Times.  \r                                                  \r\n\n     On  February  1,  1996,   Magnusson  moved  for  summary\r\n\njudgment.   The  motion  was  supported by  an  affidavit  of\r\n\nMagnusson  attesting that  he  transferred  Sullivan  because\r\n\nSullivan's complaints  that  he deserved  certain  employment\r\n\npositions  (held by  other  prisoners) due  to what  Sullivan\r\n\nconsidered to be his superior abilities had resulted in staff\r\n\nbecoming increasingly unwilling to  employ Sullivan and other\r\n\nprisoners becoming  increasingly unwilling to work  with him.\r\n\nMagnusson further  attested that he began  to receive reports\r\n\nthat  the  situation  had  deteriorated  to  the  point  that\r\n\nSullivan's personal safety was  at risk from other prisoners.\r\n\nSullivan  filed  an opposition  supported  by  his own  sworn\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nstatement  and by  various documents.   An  additional cross-\r\n\nround of  filings followed.   On February  20, 1996,  summary\r\n\njudgment  entered  in favor  of  defendant  Magnusson.   This\r\n\nappeal followed.\r\n\n     Appellees do not dispute, and we assume, that Sullivan's\r\n\nwriting  a newspaper column for the  Maine Times enjoys First\r                                                            \r\n\nAmendment  protection.   Cf. Nolan  v. Fitzpatrick,  451 F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n545, 547  (1st  Cir. 1971)  (striking  down ban  on  prisoner\r\n\nletters to news media insofar as the letters concerned prison\r\n\nmatters).   It is well established that a prisoner may not be\r\n\ntransferred from  one institution to another  for engaging in\r\n\nconstitutionally protected activity.   See McDonald v.  Hall,\r                                                                        \r\n\n610 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1979).  However, if  taken for both\r\n\npermissible and  impermissible reasons,  state action  may be\r\n\nupheld  if  the  action  would  have  been  taken   based  on\r                                \r                                \r\n\n   1The  parties devote  much of  their respective  briefs to\r               1\r            permissible reasons alone.   See Graham v.

This  latter  assumption  gains   Sullivan  very\r\nlittle.

However,\r\n\nMagnusson submitted evidence that he had a proper motive  for\r\n\nthe  transfer (namely,  concern for  Sullivan's  safety), and\r\n\nthat Sullivan  would have been  transferred anyway.   None of\r\n\nthe evidence submitted by  Sullivan controverts this evidence\r\n\nof a  legitimate motive.  Indeed,  Sullivan's admissions that\r\n\nhe considers  himself  to have  \"superior ability[]  compared\r\n\nwith  most inmates and staff,\"  and that at  least some staff\r\n\nmembers  at the Maine  State Prison were  unwilling to employ\r\n\nhim (though  Sullivan suggests  this was  due to  jealousy on\r\n\ntheir part) are consistent with Magnusson's claims. Under the\r\n\ncircumstances, we do not think there is a genuine issue as to\r\n\nthe fact that Sullivan would have been transferred regardless\r\n\nof his newspaper column.\r\n\n     We add that if Sullivan needed additional information to\r\n\nadequately   respond  to   Magnusson's  motion   for  summary\r\n\njudgment,  he could  have requested  a continuance  to permit\r\n\nfurther discovery.

However, Magnusson submitted evidence that he had a proper motive for the transfer (namely, concern for Sullivan's safety), and that Sullivan would have been transferred anyway.  None of the evidence submitted by Sullivan controverts this evidence of a legitimate motive.  Indeed, Sullivan's admissions that he considers himself to have \"superior ability[ ] compared with most inmates and staff,\" and that at least some staff members at the Maine State Prison were unwilling to employ him (though Sullivan suggests this was due to jealousy on their part) are consistent with Magnusson's claims.  Under the circumstances, we do not think there is a genuine issue as to the fact that Sullivan would have been transferred regardless of his newspaper column.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that if Sullivan needed additional information to adequately respond to Magnusson's motion for summary judgment, he could have requested a continuance to permit further discovery.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f).  His failure to do so precludes any argument on appeal that he was \"railroaded.\"   See de la Torre v. Continental Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195174\"><a href=\"/opinion/195174/de-la-torre-v-continental-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The parties devote much of their respective briefs to arguing that the other side's evidence should have been stricken from the record or disregarded.  Since it would not alter our disposition, we need not resolve all of these disputes.  In our disposition, we assume without deciding that all of the evidence Sullivan filed in the district court--though not the evidence submitted for the first time on appeal--should be considered.  Sullivan's claim that Magnusson's affidavit is too conclusory is waived because it was never presented to the district court.  However, we assume for the sake of argument that his last-minute filing, on February 20, 1996, preserved his remaining objections to Magnusson's affidavit (hearsay and lack of personal knowledge).  This latter assumption gains Sullivan very little.  To the extent that Magnusson's affidavit reports statements made by others, they may be considered as evidence of what Magnusson heard or was told about Sullivan.  See Fed.R.Evid. 801(c);   Lane v. Griffin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498151\"><a href=\"/opinion/498151/lloyd-steven-lane-v-jh-griffin-and-muhammad-nubee-chaplain-rae/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span>, 407 (4th Cir.1987).  Magnusson, at the very least, had personal knowledge of what was said to him if not the underlying facts.  It is the former which is most relevant to the issue of his motive</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
