Kevin G. is an eleven year-old boy who  suffers\r\n\nfrom several medical  conditions, including respiratory  problems\r\n\nrequiring use of a tracheal  tube for breathing.  He appeals  the\r\n\ndecision by the Cranston school district, upheld by the  district\r\n\ncourt, to  place him  in  the Gladstone  school rather  than  his\r\n\nneighborhood school, the Waterman school.   We affirm.    \r\n\n     Kevin \r                    G.'s \r                         medical conditions require that he receive medical\r\n\ncare \r              at \r                school, \r                        including a full-time nurse.  Gladstone is the only\r\n\nelementary \r                    school in the Cranston school district with a full-time\r\n\nnurse.   Kevin G. acknowledges this,  but argues that the  school\r\n\ndistrict  has the  responsibility  to  move a  nurse  teacher  to\r\n\nWaterman. \r                    \r                    In \r                      a \r                        thorough \r                                 opinion, the district court explained that\r\n\nwhile \r               the \r                   Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"the Act\"),\r\n\n20 U.S.C. SS 1411-1415, requires the school district to provide a\r\n\nfree \r              appropriate education for children with disabilities, it does\r\n\nnot \r             require \r                    optimal \r                            results.  See Kevin G. by Jo-Ann G. v. Cranston\r\n\nSchool \r                Committee, 965 F. Supp. 261 (D. R.I. 1997).  Thus, while it\r\n\nmay be preferable for Kevin G. to attend a school located minutes\r\n\nfrom  his  home,  placement  in  Gladstone  satisfies  the   Act.\r\n\nGladstone, \r                    which is located only three miles from Kevin G.'s home,\r\n\nmeets all his  educational and medical requirements.  The  school\r\n\ndistrict has an  obligation to provide  a school placement  which\r\n\nincludes a  nurse on duty  full-time, but it  is not required  to\r\n\nchange the district's placement of nurses when, as in this  case,\r\n\ncare is readily available at another easily accessible school.  \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n     Accordingly, we  agree  with  the district  court  that  the\r\n\nGladstone placement satisfies the requirements of the Act. \r\n\n     Affirmed.     \r\n\n.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\n",
