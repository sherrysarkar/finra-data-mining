This is an appeal from the\r\ndistrict court's issuance of a preliminary injunction enjoining\r\ndefendants Kohler Company and Robern, Inc. from selling the\r\nKohler Falling Water faucet, a faucet resembling plaintiff\r\nLund's VOLA faucet.  The VOLA faucet mounts on a wall, has been\r\nin the design collection at the Museum of Modern Art, and has\r\na certain cachet among those who enjoy bathrooms and kitchens\r\nbeautiful.  Kohler intended to produce a faucet like Lund's,\r\nbut not identical to it, and hence designed the now-enjoined\r\nFalling Water faucet.  There were two basic claims before the\r\ntrial court: that the Falling Water faucet \"diluted\" the VOLA\r\nfaucet's trade dress within the meaning of the Federal\r\nTrademark Dilution Act of 1995 (\"FTDA\"), 15 U.S.C.  1125(c),\r\nand that the Falling Water faucet infringed the VOLA's trade\r\ndress.  Lund won a preliminary injunction on the first ground,\r\nbut not on the second.  See I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler\r\nCo., 11 F. Supp. 2d 112, 127 (D. Mass. 1998) (\"Lund I\").\r\n  This difference in results was not anomalous.  The\r\ndistrict court found, as to the infringement claim, that while\r\nthe VOLA faucet was not inherently distinctive, it had acquired\r\nsecondary meaning and thus was protectable, but that there was\r\nno infringement because there was no confusion on the part of\r\nconsumers.  In contrast, under the FTDA, where no confusion\r\nneed be shown, the court found the VOLA faucet was famous and\r\nthat Kohler's faucet diluted the identity of the VOLA faucet.\r\n  This case presents complex issues arising in areas of\r\nintellectual property law recently extended and not yet well\r\ndemarcated.  Few courts of appeals have yet interpreted the\r\nFTDA and this court has never addressed certain key issues,\r\nunder both the infringement and FTDA claims, necessary to the\r\nresolution of the case.  The district court wrote thoughtfully,\r\nand, particularly as to the FTDA issues, without much appellate\r\nguidance.  The claim for protection here comes not from\r\ntraditional marks such as names but from the very design of the\r\nfaucet itself -- that design is said to give the faucet its\r\nidentity and distinctiveness.  Although Lund may have been able\r\nto obtain a design patent and so protect its VOLA faucet in\r\nthat way, at least for a period of fourteen years, see 35\r\nU.S.C.  173, it chose not to.  Rather, it chose to turn for\r\nprotection to legal doctrines of trademark and trade dress,\r\noriginally crafted without product designs in mind.  The trade\r\ndress of product designs, unlike other forms of trade dress,\r\ncannot be separated from the product itself.  Kohler has raised\r\nserious constitutional concerns, saying that this use of the\r\nFTDA against a competing product essentially gives a perpetual\r\nmonopoly to product design, a perpetual monopoly prohibited by\r\nthe Patent Clause. \r\n  Kohler and Robern (collectively \"Kohler\") argue that\r\nthe district court erred in its determination that plaintiffs\r\nI.P. Lund Trading ApS and Kroin Incorporated (collectively\r\n\"Lund\") demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of\r\ntheir claim under the FTDA that the Falling Water faucet\r\ndilutes the trade dress of Lund's VOLA faucet.    Lund cross-\r\nappeals, arguing that the district court erred in determining\r\nthat Lund was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its\r\ninfringement claim.  We affirm the denial of the preliminary\r\ninjunction on the infringement claim.  We vacate the grant of\r\nthe injunction on the FTDA claim.\r\n     Several questions of first impression are resolved in\r\nthis opinion.  We hold that the burden of showing non-\r\nfunctionality of a product for which trade dress protection is\r\nsought rests on the party seeking that protection.  Here that\r\nis the plaintiff Lund.  In analyzing inherent distinctiveness\r\nin the context of product design, we hold that while the well-\r\nknown Abercrombie test provides a useful analogy, strict\r\napplication of the test is not required; we reiterate this\r\ncourt's adherence to the Seabrook Foods test.  We emphasize\r\nthat, in any case where the trade dress is said to arise from\r\nthe product design, there must be separate analyses as to (1)\r\nwhether a design is inherently distinctive and (2) whether it\r\nhas nonetheless acquired distinctiveness through secondary\r\nmeaning.  As to secondary meaning said to stem from the design\r\nof the product itself, we hold that the plaintiff must show\r\nthat the primary significance of the design is to signify its\r\nsource.  \r\n     Under the FTDA, we hold that a party who wishes to\r\nestablish fame of the trade dress for which protection is\r\nsought bears a significantly greater burden than the burden of\r\nestablishing distinctiveness for infringement purposes.  The\r\nFTDA creates an exceptional anti-dilution remedy for truly\r\nfamous marks.  Once this greater burden of establishing fame\r\nhas been met under the FTDA, the issue of dilution must be\r\naddressed.  We reject the use of the \"Sweet factors\" as the test\r\nfor dilution and instead require an inquiry into whether target\r\ncustomers will perceive the products as essentially the same. \r\nWe hold that the dilution standard is a rigorous one, and Lund\r\nhas not shown that it is likely to succeed.  While we\r\nacknowledge serious constitutional concerns about application\r\nof the FTDA to a dilution claim against a competing product\r\nwhich does not confuse consumers, the resolution of the case\r\nobviates the as applied constitutional issue, and we decline to\r\naddress any residual facial challenge.\r\nI.  Standard of Review\r\n     The district court \"enjoys considerable discretion\"\r\nin determining whether to grant a preliminary injunction, but\r\nits decision \"must be supported by adequate findings of fact\r\nand conclusions of law.\"  TEC Eng'g Corp. v. Budget Molders\r\nSupply, Inc., 82 F.3d 542, 544-45 (1st Cir. 1996); see alsoCamel Hair &amp; Cashmere Inst. of America, Inc. v. Associated Dry\r\nGoods Corp., 799 F.2d 6, 12-13 (1st Cir. 1986).  \"On appellate\r\nreview of the grant or denial of a preliminary injunction, the\r\ndeferential standard of 'abuse of discretion' applies to\r\njudgment calls, by the district court, such as those that\r\ninvolve the weighing of competing considerations.\"  Public\r\nServ. Co. v. Patch, No. 98-1764, 1998 WL 823177, at *5 (1st\r\nCir. Dec. 3, 1998).  As explained in Ocean Spray Cranberries,\r\nInc. v. Pepsico, Inc., 160 F.3d 58 (1st Cir. 1998), \"[t]he\r\nusual rubric refers to abuse of discretion . . . but this\r\nphrasing is most pertinent to issues of judgment and the\r\nbalancing of conflicting factors; rulings on abstract legal\r\nissues remain reviewable de novo, and findings of fact are\r\nassessed for clear error.\"  Id. at 61 n.1 (citations omitted). \r\nIf findings are made under incorrect standards, little or no\r\ndeference is due those findings.  Cf. Uno v. City of Holyoke,\r\n72 F.3d 973, 978 (1st Cir. 1995).  Further, \"[a]buse of\r\ndiscretion occurs . . . when a material factor deserving\r\nsignificant weight is ignored, when an improper factor is\r\nrelied upon, or when all proper and no improper factors are\r\nassessed, but the court makes a serious mistake in weighing\r\nthem.\"  Foster v. Mydas Assocs., Inc., 943 F.2d 139, 143 (1st\r\nCir. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n     A party seeking a preliminary injunction must\r\nestablish that 1) it is substantially likely to succeed on the\r\nmerits of its claim; 2) absent the injunction there is \"a\r\nsignificant risk of irreparable harm\"; 3) the balance of\r\nhardships weighs in its favor; and 4) the injunction will not\r\nharm the public interest.  TEC Eng'g Corp., 82 F.3d at 544\r\n(discussing a claim for trade dress infringement).  In the\r\ntrademark context, \"irreparable harm may be shown even in the\r\nabsence of actual injury to plaintiff's business based on\r\nplaintiff's demonstration of a likelihood of success on the\r\nmerits on its claim.\"  Calamari Fisheries, Inc. v. The Village\r\nCatch, Inc., 698 F. Supp. 994, 1013 (D. Mass. 1988) (citing\r\nCamel Hair &amp; Cashmere Inst., 799 F.2d at 14).  There is no\r\nargument that the district court applied the wrong test for\r\ninjunctive relief; there is considerable dispute over the\r\nsubsidiary tests which the court applied in determining whether\r\nthere was probability of success on the various elements of the\r\nclaims.\r\nII.  Facts and Procedural History\r\n     Lund, a Danish corporation, manufactures bathroom and\r\nkitchen fixtures and accessories, including faucets.  Lund has\r\nbeen a family-owned corporation since its establishment in\r\n1873.  In 1969, Lund introduced the VOLA faucet, designed by\r\nthe noted architect Arne Jacobsen.  The faucet, which has\r\nreceived numerous awards over the past quarter-century, is\r\nLund's principal revenue-producing product.  Lund has sold a\r\ntotal of more than 600,000 VOLA faucets.  The faucet has been \r\nregularly advertised and featured in numerous magazines.  Kroin\r\nIncorporated is the sole United States distributor of the VOLA.\r\n     Kohler is the largest supplier of plumbing fixtures\r\nin this country, selling hundreds of types of kitchen and\r\nbathroom fixtures.  In 1994, Kohler contacted Lund regarding\r\nthe possibility of selling the VOLA faucet under Kohler's name. \r\nIn 1995, Kohler purchased eight VOLA faucets from Lund for the\r\npurpose of testing the faucets to see if they fit in a sink\r\nthat Kohler planned to introduce and to ensure that the faucets\r\ncomplied with United States regulations.  Kohler claims that it\r\ntested the faucets and found that they did not meet U.S.\r\nregulations regarding water flow capacity and resistance to\r\nhydrostatic pressure, a contention Lund contests, and as to\r\nwhich there was conflicting evidence. \r\n     Kohler gave a VOLA faucet to Erich Slothower, an\r\nindustrial designer employed by Kohler.  Slothower then\r\ndesigned the Falling Water faucet, which Kohler introduced for\r\nsale at a price lower than that of the VOLA faucet.  Slothower\r\ntestified that he examined the VOLA carefully prior to\r\ndesigning the Falling Water, but that he attempted to make the\r\nFalling Water faucet different from the VOLA.  Kohler's large\r\nsize and well-established distribution channels mean that the\r\nFalling Water is likely to be more easily available, in\r\naddition to being less expensive.\r\n     The district court found a number of similarities\r\nbetween the VOLA and the Falling Water faucets.  Both are\r\n\"single-control, wall-mounted faucets\" with handles that\r\n\"utilize a thin cylindrical lever to adjust water temperature\r\nand volume\"; both have \"spouts and aerator holders . . . of\r\nuniform diameter,\" with the spouts \"bend[ing] downward at right\r\nangles softened by a curve\"; and \"both faucets offer spouts in\r\nalmost exactly the same three lengths.\"  Lund I, 11 F. Supp. 2d\r\nat 116.  Both faucets fit no-hole sinks.    In contrast, most\r\nsinks sold in the United States are \"three-hole\" sinks, with one\r\nhole each for the water spout and the hot and cold spigots. \r\nHowever, the district court also found dissimilarities between\r\nthe faucets, including differences in the faucets' handles, a\r\nrounded lever on the Falling Water faucet compared to a flat\r\nlever on the VOLA, and a rounded bonnet -- a piece that\r\nconnects the faucet to the wall -- on the mounting end of the\r\nFalling Water spout, compared to no bonnet on the VOLA.  Seeid.  The court also found that the housemarks, \"VOLA\" and\r\n\"Kohler,\" are clearly dissimilar and are prominently displayed\r\non the faucets.  See id. at 123.\r\n   Co-defendant Robern, which Kohler acquired in August\r\n1995, also purchased a number of VOLA faucets.  Before being\r\nacquired by Kohler, Robern purchased 218 VOLA faucets from\r\nKroin for use in a sink module.  Robern apparently promoted its\r\nsink module pictured with the VOLA faucets.  At approximately\r\nthe same time as Kohler acquired Robern, Kroin refused to sell\r\nadditional VOLA faucets to Robern, claiming that Robern was\r\nselling the faucets to Kroin's customers at prices below those\r\nKroin was charging.  One year later, Robern announced plans to\r\nmarket its sink module with the Falling Water faucet.  Lund\r\nproduced evidence that Robern has continued to use pictures of\r\nthe VOLA in promotional materials, despite the fact that it has\r\nreplaced the VOLA with the Falling Water faucet in its sink\r\nmodules.\r\n   Kohler introduced the Falling Water faucet to the\r\nmarket in 1996.  Lund filed suit on February 27, 1997, alleging\r\ntrade dress infringement under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act\r\nand trade dress dilution under the FTDA.    Kohler denied any\r\nviolations and argued that the FTDA was unconstitutional as\r\napplied to product designs.  The district court held an\r\nevidentiary hearing on April 16 and 30, 1997. \r\n     The court ruled on the motion for a preliminary\r\ninjunction in three stages.  In a February 5, 1998 Memorandum\r\nand Order, the court found that Lund had demonstrated a\r\nsubstantial likelihood of success on its dilution claim, and so\r\nenjoined Kohler from selling its Falling Water faucet.  SeeLund I, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 127.  At the same time, the court\r\nfound that Lund had failed to show likelihood of success on its\r\nclaim of trade dress infringement, and it reserved decision on\r\nthe question of the constitutionality of the FTDA pending\r\nadditional briefing.  See id. \r\n    On February 12, 1998, the district court stayed the\r\npreliminary injunction pending resolution of Kohler's claim\r\nthat application of the FTDA to product designs violates the\r\nPatent Clause.  \r\n   In an order dated March 31, 1998 and a memorandum\r\ndated April 2, 1998, the district court found that Kohler's\r\nconstitutional argument was unlikely to succeed on the merits,\r\nlifted the stay on the injunction, and ordered Lund to post a\r\nbond of $250,000.  See I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., 11\r\nF. Supp. 2d 127, 134-35 (D. Mass. 1998) (\"Lund II\").\r\n   The district court also denied Kohler's request to\r\nstay the injunction pending appeal to this court.  On April 29,\r\n1998, this court rejected Kohler's request for a stay pending\r\nappeal.\r\nIII.  Purposes of Trademark and Trade Dress Protection\r\n   The basic building blocks of the analysis are worth\r\nreiterating.  Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act provides\r\nprotection against the use of \"any word, term, name, symbol, or\r\ndevice\" that \"is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake,\r\nor to deceive\" as to the source of a product.  15 U.S.C. \r\n1125(a).  Trade dress includes \"the design and appearance of [a]\r\nproduct together with the elements making up the overall image\r\nthat serves to identify the product presented to the consumer.\" \r\nChrysler Corp. v. Silva, 118 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir. 1997)\r\n(alteration in original) (quoting Fun-Damental Too, Ltd. v.\r\nGemmy Indus. Corp., 111 F.3d 993, 999 (2d Cir. 1997)) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).  The new law, the FTDA, Lanham Act\r\nsection 43(c), grants protection to \"famous\" marks against any\r\nuse of the mark that \"causes dilution of the distinctive quality\r\nof the mark.\"  15 U.S.C.  1125(c).  \r\n   To resolve the issues presented, we go back to the\r\nunderlying purposes of trademark and trade dress infringement\r\nand dilution protections.  The various intellectual property\r\nprotection mechanisms serve related but distinct ends.  These\r\ndistinct ends inform the selection of appropriate tests under\r\nthe different sections of the Lanham Act.  These distinctions\r\nare also particularly pertinent to Kohler's constitutional\r\nclaim that dilution protection of trade dress of product design\r\namounts to an unconstitutional perpetual monopoly under the\r\nPatent Clause of the Constitution.  The Patent Clause itself\r\ndescribes the \"exclusive Right\" given as being for \"limited\r\nTimes.\"  U.S. Const. art. I,  8, cl. 8.  \"The laws of patents,\r\ncopyright, trade secrets, trademarks, unfair competition, and\r\nmisappropriation balance the conflicting interests in\r\nprotection and dissemination differently in different contexts\r\nthrough specific rules that determine just who will receive\r\nprotection, of just what kind, under what circumstances, and\r\nfor how long.\"  DeCosta v. Viacom Int'l, Inc., 981 F.2d 602, 605\r\n(1st Cir. 1992). \r\n   A primary purpose of trade dress or trademark\r\nprotection is to protect that which identifies a product's\r\nsource.  See Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Prods. Co., 514 U.S. 159,\r\n162 (1995) (noting that \"the statutory definition of a trademark\r\n. . . requires that a person 'us[e]' or 'inten[d] to use' the\r\nmark 'to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including\r\na unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and\r\nto indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is\r\nunknown'\" (alterations in original) (quoting 15 U.S.C.  1127)). \r\n\"The purpose of trademark laws is to prevent the use of the same\r\nor similar marks in a way that confuses the public about the\r\nactual source of the goods or service.\"  Star Fin. Servs., Inc.v. Aastar Mortgage Corp., 89 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 1996). \r\nTraditional trademark and trade dress law thus encourages\r\nproduction of products of high quality \"and simultaneously\r\ndiscourages those who hope to sell inferior products by\r\ncapitalizing on a consumer's inability quickly to evaluate the\r\nquality of an item offered for sale.\"  Qualitex, 514 U.S. at\r\n164.  More importantly for our purposes, trademark and trade\r\ndress protection serves to protect both the trademark or trade\r\ndress owner and the public by avoiding confusion or mistake.  \r\n   In contrast, dilution statutes, and the FTDA in\r\nparticular, protect only the trademark or trade dress owner and\r\nare not concerned with possible confusion on the part of\r\nconsumers.  See J. Gilson, Trademark Protection and Practice 5.12 (1998).  Any protection of the public intended by the\r\nFTDA is indirect at best.  \"Anti-dilution statutes have\r\ndeveloped to fill a void left by the failure of trademark\r\ninfringement law to curb the unauthorized use of marks where\r\nthere is no likelihood of confusion between the original use\r\nand the infringing use.\"  L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers,\r\nInc., 811 F.2d 26, 30 (1st Cir. 1987).  Filling this void,\r\nCongress passed the FTDA in 1995 both to provide uniform\r\nnational protection against dilution and to bring this\r\ncountry's law into conformity with international agreements. \r\nSee H.R. Rep. No. 104-374, at 3-4 (1995), reprinted in 1995\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N 1029, 1030-31.  \r\nIV.  Prerequisites for Protection from Infringement and\r\n     Dilution\r\n     Despite different purposes being served, claims for\r\nprotection against trademark and trade dress infringement, on\r\nthe one hand, and dilution, on the other, share three common\r\nelements before the analyses diverge.  Those elements are that\r\nmarks (a) must be used in commerce, (b) must be non-functional,\r\nand (c) must be distinctive.  While all such marks may be\r\nprotected against infringement, under the FTDA only famous and\r\ndistinctive marks are eligible for protection against dilution. \r\nNo requirement for fame is present in trademark and trade dress\r\ninfringement.\r\nA.  Use in Commerce\r\n     There is no dispute that both Lund's and Kohler's\r\nfaucets have been used in commerce, thus satisfying the first\r\nrequirement for protection against both infringement and\r\ndilution.  See 15 U.S.C.  1125(a),(c).\r\nB.  Functionality\r\n     1.  Legal Standards\r\n     To be protected under the Lanham Act, a trademark or\r\ntrade dress must not be functional.  See Two Pesos, Inc. v.\r\nTaco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 775 (1992).  If the trade\r\ndress is functional, it receives no protection under trademark\r\nlaw.  The functionality doctrine has considerable economic and\r\nlegal significance.  \"The functionality doctrine prevents\r\ntrademark law, which seeks to promote competition by protecting\r\na firm's reputation, from instead inhibiting legitimate\r\ncompetition by allowing a producer to control a useful product\r\nfeature.\"  Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 164.  Thus, the functionality\r\ndoctrine marks the boundaries of trade dress protection.  \r\n     As discussed later, \"if functional features were\r\ngiven trademark or trade dress protection, such protection\r\nwould clearly clash with the objectives of federal functional\r\npatent law.\"  1 J. McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair\r\nCompetition  7:64 (4th ed. 1996).  The rule against functional\r\nfeatures being protected as symbols of origin \"is obviously to\r\nprevent the grant of perpetual monopoly by the issuance of a\r\ntrade-mark in the situation where a patent has either expired,\r\nor . . . cannot be granted.\"  Sylvania Elec. Prods., Inc. v.Dura Elec. Lamp Co., 247 F.2d 730, 732 (3d Cir. 1957).\r\n     The core inquiry into whether trade dress is\r\nfunctional requires examination of the effects that granting\r\nprotection to a product will have on the ability of others to\r\ncompete.  Thus, in Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives\r\nLaboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844 (1982), the Court stated that\r\na functional product feature is one that \"is essential to the\r\nuse or purpose of the article or [that] . . . affects the cost\r\nor quality of the article.\"  Id. at 851 n.10.  In Qualitex, the\r\nCourt added that the inquiry into functionality turns in part\r\non whether granting protection to a mark \"would permit one\r\ncompetitor . . . to interfere with legitimate (nontrademark-\r\nrelated) competition through actual or potential exclusive use\r\nof an important product ingredient.\"  Qualitex, 514 U.S. at\r\n170.  \r\n   The fact that a product contains some functional\r\nelements does not, however, preclude Lanham Act protection. \r\n\"[A] particular arbitrary combination of functional features,\r\nthe combination of which is not itself functional, properly\r\nenjoys protection.\"  Taco Cabana Int'l, Inc. v. Two Pesos, Inc.,\r\n932 F.2d 1113, 1119 (5th Cir. 1991), aff'd, 505 U.S. 763\r\n(1992).  The crucial inquiry is into the effect that granting\r\nprotection will have on the opportunity of others to compete. \r\n   As the parties note, this court has not previously\r\ndecided whether a showing of non-functionality is an element of\r\nthe claim of the party seeking protection, or whether\r\nfunctionality is an affirmative defense on which the defending\r\nparty has the burden.  See TEC Eng'g Corp., 82 F.3d at 546 n.3. \r\nIn Fisher Stoves, Inc. v. All Nighter Stove Works, Inc., 626\r\nF.2d 193 (1st Cir. 1980), this court, although not resolving\r\nthe issue, stated that it was \"not at all clear\" that the\r\ndistrict court erred when it placed the burden of proof on the\r\nplaintiff.  Id. at 195.  Other circuit courts which have\r\ndecided the issue are split.  Compare Sunbeam Prods., Inc. v.\r\nWest Bend Co., 123 F.3d 246, 251 (5th Cir. 1997) (holding that\r\nplaintiffs bear the burden), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1795\r\n(1998), Woodsmith Publ'g Co. v. Meredith Corp., 904 F.2d 1244,\r\n1247 (8th Cir. 1990), Rachel v. Banana Republic, Inc., 831 F.2d\r\n1503, 1506 (9th Cir. 1987), Ambrit, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 812\r\nF.2d 1531, 1535 (11th Cir. 1986), Kwik-Site Corp. v. Clear View\r\nMfg. Co., 758 F.2d 167, 178 (6th Cir. 1985), and CIBA-GEIGY\r\nCorp. v. Bolar Pharm. Co., 747 F.2d 844, 854 (3d Cir. 1984),\r\nwith Computer Care v. Service Sys. Enters., Inc., 982 F.2d\r\n1063, 1068 (7th Cir. 1992) (holding that defendants bear the\r\nburden), Brunswick Corp. v. Spinit Reel Co., 832 F.2d 513, 520\r\n(10th Cir. 1987), and LeSportsac, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 754\r\nF.2d 71, 75-76 (2d Cir. 1985).  See generally 1 McCarthy\r\n 7:72.  The Lanham Act itself provides no guidance on the\r\nissue, and the caselaw contains little discussion of the\r\nrationale for allocating the burden of proof to plaintiffs or\r\ndefendants.  \r\n   We hold that the party alleging trademark\r\ninfringement and dilution bears the burden of proving non-\r\nfunctionality of those elements of the physical object that the\r\nplaintiff claims constitute the mark and for which the\r\nplaintiff is seeking protection.  Several rationales support\r\nthe burden being placed on those seeking protection, here the\r\nplaintiff.  Functionality, or, more precisely, a showing of\r\nnon-functionality of the elements for which protection is\r\nsought, is an essential component of the protection the law\r\ngives to trademarks and trade dress.  A showing of non-\r\nfunctionality is essential because the doctrine prevents\r\ntrademarks from limiting legitimate competition.  Put\r\ndifferently, \"functionality\" plays an important role in\r\npreventing a constitutional problem between the Lanham Act and\r\npatent law.  Moreover, Congress did not intend to provide\r\nLanham Act protection to functional aspects of products, seeTwo Pesos, 505 U.S. at 775, and thus it would be anomalous if\r\nthe burden were not placed on the party seeking protection. \r\nSuch an assignment of the burden of proof ensures that\r\ntrademarks serve their intended purpose of identifying product\r\nsources.  \r\n   A plaintiff's product is known best by plaintiff\r\nitself.  A contrary result, placing the burden on defendant,\r\ncould lead to untoward results.  It could also lead to\r\nunwarranted litigation.  If protected elements of a product are\r\nindeed functional, and the burden of showing non-functionality\r\nis placed on plaintiff, plaintiff will have incentives not to\r\nbring unwarranted actions hoping that defendants will fail to\r\nraise or prove functionality as an affirmative defense.  It\r\nwould be far easier for plaintiffs to obtain protection for\r\nfunctional aspects of their products -- and thus limit\r\nlegitimate competition -- if defendants were to bear the burden\r\nof proof, as defendants might lack the ability or incentive to\r\npursue the issue fully.  There is value in minimizing the\r\nchances of the issue not being properly raised or presented.\r\n   2.  Application of Functionality Doctrine\r\n   The district court did not make a specific finding on\r\nfunctionality and the record on the important issue of\r\nfunctionality is unclear.    Although Lund I commented that \"[n]o\r\none argues that the VOLA design is 'functional,' as that term\r\nis used in trademark law,\"  Lund I, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 120 n.12,\r\nKohler did in fact argue in a filing that \"to the extent that\r\nsome features on the respective faucets may somewhat resemble\r\neach other, these features are either functional in nature and\r\nthus not protectable under the Lanham Act or so commonly used\r\nin the plumbing industry that they are obvious -- not\r\ndistinctive of a particular product\" (emphasis added).  Thus\r\nKohler did not waive the issue.  We cannot say that it is\r\nobvious no aspect of the VOLA is functional; indeed some\r\naspects give the appearance of being functional and so the\r\nissue is a real one.  There are significant dissimilarities\r\nbetween the two faucets, and at least some of the similarities\r\nthat do exist are suggestive of functionality.  Nonetheless, we\r\nwill assume at this stage of the case that there is some non-\r\nfunctional residuum based on the aesthetic unity and\r\nproportions of the VOLA.\r\n   The issue of functionality plays a key role in this\r\ncase.  In the absence of a finding of non-functionality of the\r\naspects of the VOLA for which protection is sought, and in\r\nlight of our placing the burden of proof on plaintiff, there\r\ncan be no trademark or trade dress protection. If the VOLA\r\ndesign or aspects of it are functional, then the only source of\r\nexclusive rights would be in a utility patent.  Trademark and\r\ntrade dress law cannot be used to evade the requirements of\r\nutility patents, nor the limits on monopolies imposed by the\r\nPatent Clause.  This also means that in the absence of a\r\nfinding of non-functionality, no protection is available under\r\nthe FTDA and no injunction may issue under the FTDA, a point to\r\nwhich we return later.\r\n   But there is another reason that the functionality\r\nanalysis must be undertaken.  There is a relationship between\r\nfunctionality and distinctiveness:\r\n   If a feature is functional, it is likely that all\r\n   similar articles will have a similar functional\r\n   feature, and one seller's feature is not likely to\r\n   evoke any response in buyers that it is unique or is\r\n   a distinctive symbol of origin.\r\n\n1 McCarthy  7:64.  It is also clear that even if a functional\r\nfeature has achieved secondary meaning as an indication of\r\norigin, that feature is not protectable under trademark or\r\ntrade dress law.  See Fisher Stoves, 626 F.2d at 195-96; 1\r\nMcCarthy  7:66.\r\nC.  Distinctiveness\r\n   The third prerequisite for protection is\r\ndistinctiveness.  In order to receive trade dress protection,\r\na product must either be inherently distinctive or have\r\nacquired secondary meaning.  See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769;\r\nTEC Eng'g Corp., 82 F.3d at 545.  The inquiry into\r\ndistinctiveness turns on the total appearance of the product,\r\nnot on individual elements.  Cf. Sunbeam, 123 F.3d at 251\r\n(stating that \"'trade dress' refers to the total image and\r\noverall appearance of a product\").  The district court found,\r\nwithin the usual preliminary injunction standards about\r\nlikelihood of success, that the VOLA faucet was not inherently\r\ndistinctive but that it had acquired secondary meaning.\r\n   1.  Inherently Distinctive Marks\r\n   In analyzing whether a product's mark is distinctive,\r\ncourts have often divided marks into the five categories set\r\nforth in Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537\r\nF.2d 4 (2d Cir. 1976): 1) generic, 2) descriptive, 3)\r\nsuggestive, 4) arbitrary, and 5) fanciful.  See Two Pesos, 505\r\nU.S. at 768 (discussing Abercrombie); Abercrombie, 537 F.2d at\r\n9.  Suggestive, arbitrary, and fanciful marks are deemed\r\ninherently distinctive; descriptive marks receive protection\r\nonly upon a showing that they have acquired secondary meaning;\r\nand generic marks are not protectable.  Abercrombie itself\r\naddressed words, the usual form of mark.  The Abercrombie test\r\nhas been used in some other areas of trade dress, such as\r\nproduct packaging and the overall appearance of a restaurant. \r\nSee Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768-69, 773.  \r\n   Courts have struggled with whether the Abercrombietest, originally designed for words, should be imported\r\nwholesale into that specialized area of trade dress claimed to\r\ncome from product design.  Although the Supreme Court in Two\r\nPesos endorsed the Abercrombie test in the context of non-\r\nverbal trade dress not involving product designs, at least two\r\ncircuits have been skeptical of the appropriateness of the test\r\nin the product design context.  See Knitwaves, Inc. v.\r\nLollytogs Ltd., 71 F.3d 996, 1007-08 (2d Cir. 1995); Duraco\r\nProds., Inc. v. Joy Plastic Enters., Ltd., 40 F.3d 1431, 1445-\r\n49 (3d Cir. 1994); 1 McCarthy  8:12.  Indeed, these courts,\r\nquestioning whether a product design can ever be inherently\r\ndistinctive, apply a more rigorous standard for determining\r\ninherent distinctiveness of product designs than they do for\r\ndetermining the inherent distinctiveness of more traditional\r\nforms of trade dress.  See Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1008-09\r\n(requiring that a product design serve primarily to indicate a\r\nproduct's source); Duraco Prods., 40 F.3d at 1449 (requiring\r\nproduct designs to be \"(i) unusual and memorable; (ii)\r\nconceptually separable from the product; and (iii) likely to\r\nserve primarily as a designator of origin of the product\").  The\r\nproblem with applying traditional trademark or trade dress\r\nclassifications to product designs arises because \"one cannot\r\nautomatically conclude from a product feature or configuration\r\n-- as one can from a product's arbitrary name . . . -- that, to\r\na consumer, it functions primarily to denote the product's\r\nsource.\"  Duraco Prods., 40 F.3d at 1441. \r\n   Parting from the skeptics, the Eighth Circuit has\r\nrejected any differentiation between product designs and other\r\nforms of trade dress.  See Stuart Hall Co. v. Ampad Corp., 51\r\nF.3d 780, 787-88 (8th Cir. 1995).  The Stuart Hall court argued\r\nthat the Second and Third Circuit tests would effectively\r\neliminate the possibility that a product design could be\r\ninherently distinctive, collapsing the inherent distinctiveness\r\ninquiry into the secondary meaning inquiry.  See id. at 787\r\n(\"The requirement of source-identification applies not to\r\nwhether a trade dress is inherently distinctive, but to whether\r\nit has a secondary meaning.\").  Such an outcome would directly\r\ncontradict the Supreme Court's holding in Two Pesos that\r\ninherently distinctive trade dress is protectable even absent\r\na showing of secondary meaning.  See id. at 788 (citing Two\r\nPesos, 505 U.S. at 769-70).\r\n   The district court here applied the Second Circuit's\r\nKnitwaves test.  It examined whether the VOLA's design was\r\n\"likely to serve primarily as a designator of origin of the\r\nproduct.\"  Lund I, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 120 (quoting Knitwaves, 71\r\nF.3d at 1008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Like the\r\ncourt in Knitwaves, the district court did so by looking to\r\nwhether the VOLA's creators intended the design to serve as a\r\nsource indicator.  See id.; see also Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1009\r\n(\"As Knitwaves' objective in the two sweater designs was\r\nprimarily aesthetic, the designs were not primarily intended as\r\nsource identification.  Those sweater designs therefore fail to\r\nqualify for protection of trade dress inherent in product\r\ndesign.\").  The court found that the VOLA's design was \"not\r\n'primarily' intended as source identification\" because \"Lund's\r\ndesign objective was 'primarily aesthetic,'\" and thus \"the\r\ndesign of the VOLA faucet cannot be considered inherently\r\ndistinctive.\"  Id. \r\n   Lund argues that the district court was in error\r\nbecause it was obligated by Supreme Court precedent to apply\r\nthe Abercrombie test.  Lund argues that application of the\r\nwrong test produced the wrong result.  Lund points to other\r\ndecisions in the District of Massachusetts which have rejected\r\nthe Knitwaves and Duraco Products tests and adopted the\r\nAbercrombie analysis in the product design context.  See Big\r\nTop USA, Inc. v. Wittern Group, 998 F. Supp. 30, 46-47 (D.\r\nMass. 1998); Lainer v. Bandwagon, Inc., 983 F. Supp. 292, 300\r\n(D. Mass. 1997).  \r\n   We do not believe that the Supreme Court's\r\nendorsement of the Abercrombie test in Two Pesos requires a\r\nstrict application of the Abercrombie test in all contexts,\r\nparticularly where product design is involved.  The Supreme\r\nCourt stated only that \"[m]arks are often classified in\" the\r\nfive Abercrombie categories.  Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768.  The\r\nCourt did not mandate the application of the Abercrombie test;\r\nrather, it affirmed the use of the Abercrombie factors in the\r\ncase before it.  See id. at 768-69.  The holding of Two Pesoswas that plaintiffs seeking protection for inherently\r\ndistinctive trade dress are not required to demonstrate\r\nsecondary meaning.  See id. at 770.  Unless the Court decides\r\nto carve out an exception to this rule for claims about product\r\ndesign, which we deem unlikely, then the holding must be\r\nhonored.  And so we agree with the Eighth Circuit that the test\r\nfor inherent distinctiveness should not be altered to the\r\ndegree that it eviscerates the distinction between inherently\r\ndistinctive trade dress and trade dress that has acquired\r\nsecondary meaning.  We do not believe, however, that analysis\r\nof the problem using different factors than the Abercrombiefactors results in such an outcome.\r\n   This court has previously relied on the test set\r\nforth in Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. Bar-Well Foods Ltd., 568 F.2d\r\n1342 (C.C.P.A. 1977), to determine whether a product design is\r\ninherently distinctive, and we do so again.  In Wiley v.\r\nAmerican Greetings Corp., 762 F.2d 139 (1st Cir. 1985), this\r\ncourt stated that inherent distinctiveness of a product design\r\nshould be determined by reference to \r\n   whether [the design] was a \"common\" basic shape or\r\n   design, whether it was unique or unusual in a\r\n   particular field, whether it was a mere refinement of\r\n   a commonly-adopted and well-known form of\r\n   ornamentation for a particular class of goods viewed\r\n   by the public as dress or ornamentation for the\r\n   goods, or whether it was capable of creating a\r\n   commercial impression distinct from the accompanying\r\n   words.\r\n\nId. at 141 (alteration in original) (quoting Seabrook Foods,\r\n568 F.2d at 1344) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We also\r\nagree with one commentator's analysis that \"[i]n reality, all\r\nthree [Seabrook Foods] questions are merely different ways to\r\nask whether the design, shape or combination of elements is so\r\nunique, unusual or unexpected in this market that one can\r\nassume without proof that it will automatically be perceived by\r\ncustomers as an indicator of origin -- a trademark.\"  1 McCarthy\r\n 8:13.  Although the plaintiff in Wiley brought suit under\r\nstate common law, we find the test equally applicable to claims\r\nbrought under the Lanham Act.  \r\n   The Seabrook Foods test is largely consistent with\r\nthe Second Circuit's Knitwaves test for inherent\r\ndistinctiveness, that is, whether the design \"is likely to serve\r\nprimarily as a designator of origin of the product.\"  Knitwaves,\r\n71 F.3d at 1008 (quoting Duraco Prods., 40 F.3d at 1449)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Landscape Forms,\r\nInc. v. Columbia Cascade Co., 113 F.3d 373, 378 n.3 (2d Cir.\r\n1997) (rejecting an argument that the Knitwaves and Seabrook\r\nFoods tests are inconsistent).\r\n   In contrast to the Second Circuit, however, we\r\nbelieve that Two Pesos obliges courts to maintain a clear\r\ndistinction between the inquiry into secondary meaning and the\r\ninquiry into inherent distinctiveness.  Cf. Knitwaves, 71 F.3d\r\nat 1008.  Although plaintiffs seeking to demonstrate that a\r\nproduct design is inherently distinctive may find that their\r\ntask is a difficult one, Two Pesos makes clear that this\r\nopportunity remains open.  Product designs are unlike many more\r\ntraditional subjects of trademark protection, \"which almost\r\nautomatically tell a customer that they refer to a brand,\"\r\nQualitex, 514 U.S. at 162-63, and it is therefore unlikely that\r\nmany product designs will be found to be inherently\r\ndistinctive.  Nevertheless, plaintiffs seeking trade dress\r\nprotection for product designs are entitled to attempt to show\r\nthat their designs are so unique as to be primarily perceived\r\nas indicating the product's origin.  Cf. 2 McCarthy  15:9 (\"A\r\ndesign or shape, or a trade dress that is so fanciful as to be\r\ninherently distinctive can function as a mark without the need\r\nfor proof of secondary meaning.  The issue is whether this\r\nshape is so different or unusual for this type of goods or\r\nservices that its distinctiveness can be assumed.\").\r\n   Applying Knitwaves, the district court did make a\r\nfinding as to inherent distinctiveness.  It found that the\r\nVOLA's design is not \"likely to serve primarily as a designator\r\nof origin of the product.\"  On this record that finding cannot\r\nbe said to be clearly erroneous.  One aspect of the test\r\napplied in reaching this conclusion is, nonetheless,\r\nproblematic.  The district court relied on evidence as to\r\nLund's intent.  But the plaintiff's intent is not entitled to\r\nmuch weight in a determination of whether a product design is\r\ninherently distinctive.  See 1 McCarthy  8.13 (stating that\r\n\"the intent of the designer is a very weak indicator of the\r\nlikely reaction of potential customers\"); cf. Landscape Forms,\r\n113 F.3d at 377 n.3 (\"If Knitwaves forced courts to decide\r\nwhether a manufacturer's purpose was to create either something\r\nof beauty or something indicative of source, we agree the task\r\nwould often prove impossible.\").  The district court may,\r\nhowever, have given little weight to this factor in reaching\r\nits conclusion.  \r\n     The district court used the Knitwaves test, which is\r\nconsistent with this Circuit's Wiley/Seabrook test, to reach\r\nits conclusion.  There is adequate evidence in the record to\r\nsupport the district court's determination there was little\r\nprobability of success in demonstrating that the VOLA's design\r\ninherently and primarily serves to identify the faucet's\r\nsource.\r\n     2.  Secondary Meaning\r\n     The second method for demonstrating that a product's\r\ntrademark or trade dress is distinctive and thus protectable is\r\nthrough a showing that the mark has acquired secondary meaning. \r\n\"To establish secondary meaning, a manufacturer must show that,\r\nin the minds of the public, the primary significance of a\r\nproduct feature or term is to identify the source of the\r\nproduct rather than the product itself.\"  Inwood Lab., 456 U.S.\r\nat 851 n.11.  \r\n     While some have suggested that the primary\r\nsignificance test is too stringent, particularly for product\r\ndesign cases, we reject any lesser test.  The Supreme Court has\r\nconsistently used \"primary significance.\"  As the Court said in\r\na case concerning a product design (the shape of a shredded\r\nwheat cereal biscuit), secondary meaning occurs when \"the\r\nprimary significance . . . in the minds of the consuming public\r\nis not the product but the producer.\"  Kellogg Co. v. National\r\nBiscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 118 (1938).  Where protection of the\r\nproduct design itself is at issue, there is every reason to\r\nhold to the usual stringent primary significance test in order\r\nto minimize constitutional concerns.\r\n     Secondary meaning may be \"established in a number of\r\nways,\" and courts may weigh a number of factors, including the\r\nlength or exclusivity of use of a mark, \"the size or prominence\r\nof [plaintiff's] enterprise,\" and the existence of substantial\r\nadvertising by plaintiff.  President &amp; Trustees of Colby\r\nCollege v. Colby College-New Hampshire, 508 F.2d 804, 807-08\r\n(1st Cir. 1975).  Other factors include the product's\r\n\"[e]stablished place in the market\" and \"[p]roof of intentional\r\ncopying.\"  2 McCarthy  15:30; see also Boston Beer Co. Ltd.\r\nPartnership v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., 9 F.3d 175, 182 (1st\r\nCir. 1993) (listing factors).  Secondary meaning may be\r\ndetermined with reference to a particular trade or \"branch of\r\nthe purchasing public.\"  See Colby College, 508 F.2d at 808\r\n(quoting G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. v. Saalfield, 198 F. 369, 373 (6th\r\nCir. 1912)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \r\n     The district court found that Lund had a likelihood\r\nof success of showing that the VOLA had achieved secondary\r\nmeaning, noting that \"there is sufficient evidence in the record\r\n. . . to conclude that purchasers of high-end bathroom\r\nfixtures, including interior designers, now know the VOLA by\r\nsight.\"  Lund I, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 121.  The district court also\r\nfound that \"[e]nough money and effort has been invested in\r\npromoting the VOLA's design that it is recognizable as coming\r\nfrom a unique source, albeit through a variety of distributors,\"\r\nand that \"the primary significance of the VOLA design, to the\r\nrelevant public, is as a high-end product, coming from Lund.\" \r\nId.\r\n     Kohler challenges the district court's determination\r\nthat the VOLA has most likely acquired secondary meaning.  We\r\nreview the district court's findings of fact for clear error.\r\n     The district court's conclusion is doubtful for\r\nseveral reasons.  First, as noted, there was no analysis of\r\nfunctionality and there is a relationship between functionality\r\nand secondary meaning.\r\n     Second, the context suggests otherwise -- the\r\ndistrict court found, under separate but related doctrines,\r\nthat the faucets were mostly dissimilar.  Cf. 2 McCarthy\r\n 15:38 (stating that copying may give rise to an inference of\r\nsecondary meaning).  The court found that there was no customer\r\nconfusion.  It is in this barren context that the claim is made\r\nthat something in the design which is not functional serves\r\nprimarily to signify the source of the faucet and not primarily\r\nto signify that it is an aesthetically pleasing faucet.\r\n     Third, little is present of the evidence\r\ntraditionally relied on (but which admittedly is not a sine qua\r\nnon) for a finding of secondary meaning.  The secondary meaning\r\nanalysis is primarily a subjective one, looking into the minds\r\nof potential customers.  Customer survey evidence, while not\r\nrequired, is a valuable method of showing secondary meaning.\r\nSee Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan, 867 F.2d 22, 32 n.9 (1st\r\nCir. 1989); Colby College, 508 F.2d at 809.  As the district\r\ncourt correctly noted, the purported survey evidence was\r\nunreliable.  The expert testimony, which involved one expert\r\ntestifying for each side, was contradictory.\r\n     Fourth, the VOLA has been sold by a number of\r\ndifferent companies in this country and has not been advertised\r\nhere as coming from Lund.  This situation is akin to the use of\r\ndifferent marks to identify a single product.  \"When a product\r\n. . . design is sold by the authority of plaintiff under\r\nseveral different word marks . . ., it is more difficult for\r\nplaintiff to prove acquisition of secondary meaning - that is,\r\nthat the shape or design identifies a single source.\"    1\r\nMcCarthy  8:14 (emphasis in original).\r\n   Finally, while such testimony is entitled to little\r\nweight because the focus is on the understanding of prospective\r\npurchasers, the testimony is that Lund did not intend in\r\ndesigning the product that the design signify source.\r\n   It is true that the VOLA product has been much\r\nadvertised or featured, but at times without any source\r\nattribution or with attribution to different sources.\r\n   Lund relies heavily on the testimony of Corbin, a\r\nretailer presented as Lund's expert.  Corbin stated that the\r\nVOLA was \"perceived as a high-end product, a very simple and\r\nelegant product; one that is generally known by name as either\r\na Kroin faucet or Jacobsen faucet; . . . a design icon . . . .\" \r\nBut to say it is a design success is not to say that the\r\nprimary significance of the design is to signify its source.\r\n   In the end we need not resolve the point.  Lund lost\r\non the infringement preliminary injunction and for other\r\nreasons, even if Lund had shown secondary meaning, it has not\r\nshown itself entitled to relief under the FTDA.\r\nV.  Infringement\r\n   Establishing trademark infringement requires a\r\nshowing that prospective buyers of the product in question --\r\nhere, high-end faucets -- are likely to be confused as to the\r\nproduct's source.  See 15 U.S.C.  1125(a); Two Pesos, 505 U.S.\r\nat 769; TEC Eng'g Corp., 82 F.3d at 545; Purolator, Inc. v.\r\nEFRA Distribs., Inc., 687 F.2d 554, 559 (1st Cir. 1982); cf.International Ass'n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers v.\r\nWinship Green Nursing Ctr., 103 F.3d 196, 201 (1st Cir. 1996)\r\n(\"[T]he law has long demanded a showing that the allegedly\r\ninfringing conduct carries with it a likelihood of confounding\r\nan appreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers\r\nexercising ordinary care.\").  Establishing infringement also\r\nrequires a showing that the plaintiff uses, and thus owns, the\r\nmark in question, and that the defendant's mark is similar to\r\nor the same as the plaintiff's mark.  See DeCosta, 981 F.2d at\r\n605.  A plaintiff is not entitled to a preliminary injunction\r\non a trademark infringement claim unless it can persuade the\r\ndistrict court that it is likely to be able to demonstrate\r\nconsumer confusion.  See WCVB-TV v. Boston Athletic Ass'n, 926\r\nF.2d 42, 44 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\n   This court has identified eight factors to be weighed\r\nin determining likelihood of confusion:\r\n   (1) the similarity of the marks; (2) the similarity\r\n   of the goods; (3) the relationship between the\r\n   parties' channels of trade; (4) the relationship\r\n   between the parties' advertising; (5) the classes of\r\n   prospective purchasers; (6) evidence of actual\r\n   confusion; (7) the defendant's intent in adopting its\r\n   mark; and (8) the strength of the plaintiff's mark. \r\n   . . .  No one factor is necessarily determinative,\r\n   but each must be considered.\r\n\nBoston Athletic Ass'n, 867 F.2d at 29 (quoting Volkswagenwerk\r\nAktiengesellschaft v. Wheeler, 814 F.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir.\r\n1987)) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The\r\nfactors are non-exclusive, however, and are not always apt to\r\nthe particular facts of a case.  See Winship Green, 103 F.3d at\r\n201.  In addition, the first factor, similarity, \"is determined\r\non the basis of the total effect of the designation, rather\r\nthan a comparison of individual features.\"  Pignons S.A. de\r\nMecanique de Precision v. Polaroid Corp., 657 F.2d 482, 487\r\n(1st Cir. 1981) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \r\n   The district court applied these eight factors and\r\ndetermined that, taken together, the factors weighed against a\r\nfinding of a likelihood of consumer confusion.  The court found\r\nthat the strength of the VOLA's mark and the similarity of the\r\nVOLA and the Falling Water products were factors that favored\r\nthe plaintiffs, but that the class of prospective purchasers,\r\nthe channels of trade, the defendant's intent, and the\r\ndissimilarity of the VOLA and Falling Water marks all favored\r\nthe defendants.  The court found that the two remaining factors\r\ndid not weigh in favor of either party.\r\n   Lund argues that the district court misapplied the\r\neight factors listed above, saying the court committed four\r\nerrors.  First, Lund argues that the district court accorded\r\nconsumer sophistication excessive weight, particularly in\r\nreaching its determination that the channels of trade and the\r\nclasses of prospective consumers made confusion less likely. \r\nSecond, Lund argues that the court erred in its determination\r\nthat the dissimilarity of the marks weighed against a finding\r\nof consumer confusion.  Third, Lund argues that the district\r\ncourt erred when it found that Kohler's intention not to copy\r\nthe VOLA weighed against a finding of consumer confusion. \r\nFourth, Lund argues that the district court ignored evidence of\r\nactual consumer confusion.\r\n   Review of factual determinations is for clear error. \r\nWe have carefully considered each of Lund's arguments, and are\r\nunpersuaded that the district court's determination as to the\r\nprobability of success on each of these points was erroneous. \r\nHowever, we clarify two matters.\r\n   First, little weight should be given to the\r\ndetermination that Kohler did not intend to copy the VOLA.  In\r\nChrysler, this court commented that \"[s]trictly, intent, or lack\r\nthereof, does not affect the eyes of the viewer.\"  Chrysler, 118\r\nF.3d at 59 n.3.  We added that \"[p]roof of bad intent may,\r\npsychologically, hurt as an admission,\" but \"[p]roof of good\r\nintent does not change appearance.\"  Id.  Similarly, in Star\r\nFinancial Services we commented that \"a finding of good faith\r\nis no answer if likelihood of confusion is otherwise\r\nestablished.\"  Star Fin. Servs., 89 F.3d at 11 (quoting Colby\r\nCollege, 508 F.2d at 811-12) (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).  Thus a finding of no intent to copy may not outweigh\r\nother factors that suggest a likelihood of confusion. \r\n   Second, the district court's discussion of post-sale\r\nconfusion was based on an erroneous premise.  In finding that\r\npost-sale confusion was unlikely, the court commented that\r\n\"there is little or no chance that [the faucets] will be resold\r\nto unwary consumers.\"  Lund I, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 123.  Post-sale\r\nconfusion refers not to the resale of the original product,\r\nhowever, but to the risk that non-purchasers, who themselves\r\nmay be future consumers, will be deceived.  See 3 McCarthy \r\n23:7 (noting that \"[t]he damage to the senior user . . . is that\r\nconsumers could acquire the prestige value of the senior user's\r\nproduct by buying the copier's cheap imitation,\" and that in\r\nsuch a case, \"[e]ven though the knowledgeable buyer knew that\r\nit was getting an imitation, viewers would be confused\").  For\r\nexample, in a case involving counterfeit Rolex watches, the\r\ncourt commented that\r\n   [i]ndividuals examining the counterfeits, believing\r\n   them to be genuine Rolex watches, might find\r\n   themselves unimpressed with the quality of the item\r\n   and consequently be inhibited from purchasing the\r\n   real time piece.  Others who see the watches bearing\r\n   the Rolex trademarks on so many wrists might find\r\n   themselves discouraged from acquiring a genuine\r\n   because the items have become too common place and no\r\n   longer possess the prestige once associated with\r\n   them.\r\n\nRolex Watch U.S.A., Inc. v. Canner, 645 F. Supp. 484, 495 (S.D.\r\nFla. 1986).  In other words, even if the purchaser of a Falling\r\nWater faucet knew that she was buying the Kohler faucet and not\r\nthe VOLA, the district court could still find a likelihood of\r\nconfusion if subsequent viewers of the faucet would believe it\r\nto be a VOLA.  Cf. Keds Corp. v. Renee Int'l Trading Corp., 888\r\nF.2d 215, 222 (1st Cir. 1989) (noting that \"point of sale\r\nconfusion was not the only issue\" because \"prospective\r\nconsumers, viewing the clothes on other people, would be\r\nconfused as to the origin of the goods\").  However, because the\r\ndistrict court's determination of no likelihood of post-sale\r\nconfusion does not appear to have been a key factor in its\r\ndecision, we do not believe it undercuts the court's conclusion\r\nregarding probability of success on the merits. \r\n   The district court correctly found that Lund was\r\nunlikely to prevail on the merits of its infringement claim,\r\nand so correctly denied the preliminary injunction on those\r\ngrounds.\r\nVI.  Dilution\r\n   Lund obtained the preliminary injunction against\r\nKohler's distribution and promotion of the Falling Water faucet\r\nbased on the district court's finding of likelihood of success\r\nunder the new federal anti-dilution statute, the FTDA, which\r\nbecame effective in 1996.  The injunction rested on the\r\nconclusion that Lund had established a likelihood of success of\r\nshowing two essential elements.  The first is that the \"mark,\"\r\nthat is, the VOLA product design as an identifying mark, was\r\n\"famous.\"  The second is that Kohler's Falling Water faucet\r\n\"diluted\" Lund's mark.  Both the terms \"famous\" and \"dilution\"\r\nare terms of art given specific rigorous meanings by the FTDA.\r\n   We start with the language of the Act.  The FTDA\r\nprovides:\r\n   The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, subject\r\n   to the principles of equity and upon such terms as\r\n   the court deems reasonable, to an injunction against\r\n   another person's commercial use in commerce of a mark\r\n   or trade name, if such use begins after the mark has\r\n   become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive\r\n   quality of the mark, and to obtain such other relief\r\n   as is provided in this subsection.\r\n\n15 U.S.C.  1125(c)(1).\r\n   The FTDA created a new \"federal cause of action to\r\nprotect famous marks from unauthorized users that attempt to\r\ntrade upon the goodwill and established renown of such marks\r\nand, thereby, dilute their distinctive quality.\"  H.R. Rep. No.\r\n104-374, at 3, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N at 1030.  Congress\r\nacted against a \"patch-quilt system\" of state law protection in\r\nwhich approximately twenty-five states had laws prohibiting\r\ntrademark dilution.  Id.  While creating a federal cause of\r\naction, Congress expressly did not preempt state law, but\r\nattempted to create uniformity through the availability of a\r\nfederal cause of action.  A second consideration -- protection\r\nof famous marks of U.S. companies abroad -- also motivated\r\nCongress.  See id. at 4, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N at 1031. \r\nEnactment of the FTDA was consistent with agreements which were\r\npart of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs\r\nand Trade (specifically, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects\r\nof Intellectual Property Rights, including Trade in Counterfeit\r\nGoods (\"TRIPS\")) and the Paris Convention.  Enactment of the law\r\nwas also thought to be of value to the U.S. in bilateral and\r\nmulti-lateral trade negotiations.  See id.\r\n   Sponsors of the bill articulated the type of problem\r\nthe Act was meant to solve:\r\n   [T]his bill is designed to protect famous trademarks\r\n   from subsequent uses that blur the distinctiveness of\r\n   the mark or tarnish or disparage it, even in the\r\n   absence of a likelihood of confusion.  Thus, for\r\n   example, the use of DuPont shoes, Buick aspirin, and\r\n   Kodak pianos would be actionable under this bill.\r\n\n141 Cong. Rec. S19306, S19310 (daily ed. Dec. 29, 1995)\r\n(statement of Sen. Hatch).  Thus the archetypal problems\r\ninvolved non-competing products as to which there could, by\r\ndefinition, be no confusion and a world-famous brand name which\r\nwas either tarnished or blurred by its application to a\r\ndifferent product which was obviously trading on the good will\r\nof that name.\r\n   The language of the FTDA itself is, however, not\r\nlimited to addressing these archetypal problems.  A few\r\nobservations are in order.  First, the Act applies to products\r\nwhich are competitors (as is true of the faucets here) as well\r\nas to products which are totally dissimilar and are not\r\ncompetitors.  Second, the Act applies to a famous \"mark\" and\r\ndoes not restrict the definition of that term to names or\r\ntraditional marks.  In the absence of such a restriction, the\r\nAct applies to all types of marks recognized by the Lanham Act,\r\nincluding marks derived from product designs.  Kohler's\r\nargument that the Act cannot, as a matter of statutory\r\ninterpretation, be applied to product design is rejected. \r\nThird, the Act applies even where there is no customer\r\nconfusion, a point with consequences discussed later.  Fourth,\r\nthe additional protection afforded by the Act requires that a\r\nmark go beyond what is required for ordinary Lanham Act\r\nprotection.  Only those marks which are \"distinctive and famous\"\r\nare protected.  15 U.S.C.  1125(c)(1).  As set forth in the\r\n1987 Trademark Review Commission Report, the precursor of the\r\n1996 Act, this language reflected \"the policy goal that to be\r\nprotected, a mark had to be truly prominent and renowned.\"  3\r\nMcCarthy  24.91 (citing The United States Trademark\r\nAssociation Trademark Review Commission Report and\r\nRecommendations to USTA President and Board of Directors, 77\r\nTrademark Rep. 375, 459-60 (1987)).  With this background, we\r\nturn to the district court's two essential conclusions.\r\nA.  Fame and Distinctiveness\r\n   The requirements of commercial use, non-\r\nfunctionality, and distinctiveness are common to both the\r\ninfringement claim and the FTDA dilution claim.  In order to\r\nfall within the sphere of protection against dilution the FTDA\r\nadds an additional requirement: the FTDA grants protection only\r\nto famous marks.  See 15 U.S.C.  1125(c); cf. Gilson\r\n 5.12[1][a] (calling the FTDA \"a major breakthrough for an\r\nelite category of trademark owners\").  The FTDA provides a non-\r\nexclusive list of eight factors that courts  should consider in\r\ndetermining whether a mark is \"distinctive and famous.\"  15\r\nU.S.C.  1125(c)(1).  The eight statutory factors are: \r\n   (A) the degree of inherent or acquired\r\n   distinctiveness of the mark;\r\n   (B) the duration and extent of use of the mark in\r\n   connection with the goods or services with which the\r\n   mark is used;\r\n   (C) the duration and extent of advertising and\r\n   publicity of the mark;\r\n   (D) the geographical extent of the trading area in\r\n   which the mark is used;\r\n   (E) the channels of trade for the goods or services\r\n   with which the mark is used;\r\n   (F) the degree of recognition of the mark in the\r\n   trading areas and channels of trade used by the\r\n   marks' owner and the person against whom the\r\n   injunction is sought;\r\n   (G) the nature and extent of use of the same or\r\n   similar marks by third parties; and\r\n   (H) whether the mark was registered under the Act of\r\n   March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on\r\n   the principal register.  \r\nId.  The district court found likelihood of success on the\r\nclaim that the VOLA's design was a famous mark.  Kohler\r\nchallenges this finding.\r\n   Both the text and legislative history of the original\r\nbill in 1988 and the FTDA itself indicate a congressional\r\nintent that courts should be discriminating and selective in\r\ncategorizing a mark as famous.  For example, the Senate\r\nJudiciary Committee Report on the 1988 precursor bill   said the\r\nCommittee wished \"to underscore its determination that the new\r\ndilution provisions should apply only to . . . very unique\r\nmarks.\"  3 McCarthy  24:92 n.6 (quoting S. Rep. No. 100-515,\r\nat 41-42) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Trademark\r\nReview Commission noted that the showing of fame required\r\nemployment of a \"higher standard\" than fame among an\r\n\"appreciable number of persons\" in order to be \"eligible for\r\nthis extraordinary remedy.\"  Id. n.8 (quoting The United States\r\nTrademark Association Trademark Review Commission Report, 77\r\nTrademark Rep. at 461) (internal quotation marks omitted).  One\r\ncommentator has referred to this category of famous marks as\r\n\"Supermark[s].\"  See Gilson  5.12[1][a].  As the Restatement\r\n(Third) of Unfair Competition notes:\r\n   A mark that evokes an association with a specific\r\n   source only when used in connection with the\r\n   particular goods or services that it identifies is\r\n   ordinarily not sufficiently distinctive to be\r\n   protected against dilution.\r\n\nRestatement (Third) of Unfair Competition  25 cmt. e (1995).\r\n   The record here reflects that there was not\r\nsufficient attention paid to the heightened fame standard that\r\nthe FTDA establishes.  The district court found that \"in its\r\nmarket, the VOLA's design is famous and distinctive\" based on\r\nits prior analysis under the infringement claim that \"the VOLA\r\nmark is strong, and has acquired secondary meaning in its\r\nmarket; and it has been used for some twenty years in this\r\ncountry.\"  Lund I, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 125.  Both the Restatement\r\n(Third) of Unfair Competition and the state anti-dilution\r\nstatutes against the background of which Congress enacted the\r\nFTDA make clear that the standard for fame and distinctiveness\r\nrequired to obtain anti-dilution protection is more rigorous\r\nthan that required to seek infringement protection.  SeeRestatement (Third) of Unfair Competition  25 cmt. e.  As one\r\ncommentator has stated:\r\n   Certainly, the mere acquisition of secondary meaning\r\n   to achieve trademark status in a non-inherently\r\n   distinctive designation is nowhere near sufficient to\r\n   achieve the status of \"famous mark\" under the anti-\r\n   dilution statute.  The acquisition of secondary\r\n   meaning merely establishes the minimum threshold\r\n   necessary for trademark status: section 43(c)\r\n   requires a great deal more. \r\n\n3 McCarthy  24:91; see also Gilson  5.12[1][c][ii] (\"A\r\ntrademark can certainly be distinctive without being famous,\r\nbut it cannot be famous without being distinctive.\").  \r\n   We do not understand the district court's conclusion\r\nabout fame, despite some ambiguity, to have rested solely on\r\nits conclusion that the VOLA faucet was distinctive (because it\r\nhad acquired secondary meaning); any such per se analysis would\r\nbe erroneous.  But it appears that the district court did not\r\napply the more rigorous definition of fame under the FTDA. \r\nWhile one can posit a case having very strong facts which\r\nsupport a distinctiveness finding based on secondary meaning\r\nand then using those facts to support the separate, more\r\nrigorous analysis of fame, the facts in this case do not have\r\nsuch strength.  Lund has a difficult case to establish fame\r\nthrough the product design of the VOLA faucet, and this record\r\nis not strong.  There has been no use by Kohler of the VOLA\r\nname, or any other name by which the faucet is known.  Kohler's\r\nuse, if any, is of a like product design.  There is little to\r\nsuggest that this product design, itself unregistered and not\r\ninherently distinctive, is so strong a mark and so well\r\npublicized and known that it has achieved the level of fame\r\nCongress intended under the Act.  Consumer surveys could be\r\nused as evidence of such fame, but consumer surveys are absent\r\nfrom this case.  Additionally, although some marks, such as\r\nCOCA-COLA, may be so famous as to be judicially noticed, seeGilson  5.12[1][c][iii], the VOLA faucet is far from being a\r\ncandidate for such judicial notice.\r\n Further, national renown   is an important factor in\r\ndetermining whether a mark qualifies as famous under the FTDA. \r\nAlthough the district court found that \"in the world of interior\r\ndesign and high-end bathroom fixtures, the VOLA is renowned,\"\r\nLund I, 11 F. Supp. 2d at 126, and that the faucet has been\r\nfeatured and advertised in national magazines and displayed in\r\nmuseums, whether the VOLA's identifying design is sufficiently\r\nfamous to qualify for the FTDA's protection is far from clear. \r\nIn light of the rigorous standard for fame, we find that Lund\r\nhas not met its burden of showing likelihood of success.\r\nB.  Dilution \r\n   Under the FTDA, even if a mark is famous there is no\r\nrelief unless that mark has been diluted.  As the district\r\ncourt noted, there are two types of dilution recognized:\r\nblurring and tarnishing.  This case involves no claim of\r\ntarnishing, an area in which Congress expressed a strong\r\ninterest.  Further, in light of the finding of no customer\r\nconfusion, only a particular type of blurring may be involved.\r\n   The intellectual origins of the dilution doctrine are\r\ntraced to a 1927 Harvard Law Review article, which urged\r\nprotection against \"the gradual whittling away or dispersion of\r\nthe identity and hold upon the public mind of the mark or name\r\nby its use upon non-competing goods.\"  Schecter, The Rational\r\nBasis of Trademark Protection, 40 Harv. L. Rev. 813, 825\r\n(1927).  Although the origins of the doctrine are concerned\r\nwith non-competing goods, Congress used language in the FTDA\r\nwhich extends dilution protection even to competing goods. \r\n\"Dilution\" is defined as \"the lessening of the capacity of a\r\nfamous mark to identify and distinguish good or services.\"  15\r\nU.S.C.  1127; see also H.R. Rep. No. 104-374, at 3, reprinted\r\nin 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N at 1030 (stating that dilution \"applies when\r\nthe unauthorized use of a famous mark reduces the public's\r\nperception that the mark signifies something unique, singular,\r\nor particular\"); 3 McCarthy  24:93 (\"The crux is whether this\r\nparticular challenged use lessens the capacity of the famous\r\nmark to carry out its role as a trademark -- namely, to\r\nidentify and distinguish.\").  \r\n   This case differs in several respects from usual\r\ndilution cases.  First, unlike most claims of dilution by\r\ntarnishment or blurring, the aspect of its product that Lund\r\nseeks to protect -- the design of the VOLA faucet -- likely\r\ncould have been protected by a design patent.    The possibility\r\nof obtaining a design patent is not dispositive of the\r\navailability of trade dress protection: more than one form of\r\nintellectual property protection may simultaneously protect\r\nparticular product features.  Moreover, design patent\r\nprotection would not have provided protection identical to that\r\nsought here.  Nevertheless, the availability of design patent\r\nprotection does suggest that the claim in this case differs\r\nfundamentally from the claims the drafters of the FTDA had in\r\nmind -- cases where dilution protection is the only form of\r\nprotection available for a famous mark threatened by\r\nunauthorized use of the mark that lessens the mark's capacity\r\nto identify its source.  Congress's intent to provide\r\nprotection where none previously existed is evidenced by the\r\nHouse Report's statement that \"[a] federal dilution statute is\r\nnecessary because famous marks ordinarily are used on a\r\nnationwide basis and dilution protection is currently only\r\navailable on a patch-quilt system of protection, in that only\r\napproximately 25 states have laws that prohibit trademark\r\ndilution.\"  H.R. Rep. No. 104-374, at 3, reprinted in 1995\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 1030.\r\n     Second, Lund is seeking protection against a direct\r\ncompetitor.  Although the FTDA states that dilution protection\r\nis available against unauthorized use of a famous mark that\r\nlessens the mark's ability \"to identify and distinguish goods\r\nor services, regardless of the presence or absence of . . .\r\ncompetition between the owner of the famous mark and other\r\nparties,\" 15 U.S.C.  1127 (emphasis added), dilution protection\r\nhas most often been extended to non-competing uses of a mark,\r\nsee, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 104-374, at 3, reprinted in 1995\r\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 1030 (giving examples of \"DUPONT shoes, BUICK\r\naspirin, and KODAK pianos\"); 3 McCarthy  24.72 (noting \"split\r\nof authority under . . . state statutes as to whether the anti-\r\ndilution rule is applicable where the parties are in\r\ncompetition\").  The FTDA recognizes the possibility that\r\ndilution may occur in some circumstances where, although some\r\nconsumers are not confused as to the products' sources, a\r\ncompetitor's use of a mark tarnishes or blurs a senior mark. \r\nNevertheless, such cases are likely to be exceptions to the\r\nmore common cases of dilution by non-competing marks.  Dilution\r\nlaws are intended to address specific harms; they are not\r\nintended to serve as mere fallback protection for trademark\r\nowners unable to prove trademark infringement.\r\n     While there may be a tendency to think of dilution in\r\nterms of confusion, Congress made it clear that dilution can\r\noccur even in the absence of confusion.  It is simple to see\r\nwhy that should be so when non-competing goods are at issue. \r\nNo one would confuse Kodak pianos with Kodak film, but the use\r\nof the name on the piano could dilute its effectiveness as a\r\nmark for the film.  But Congress did not say that there can be\r\ndilution without confusion only among non-competing goods.  As\r\nthe district court aptly noted, the analysis becomes\r\ncomplicated when the concept of blurring is applied to\r\ncompeting similar products. \r\n     We deal first with the approach taken by the district\r\ncourt, an approach which had support in precedent.  The\r\ndistrict court articulated the standard for determining\r\nblurring as follows: \"Lund must demonstrate that 'the use of a\r\njunior mark has caused a lessening of demand for the product or\r\nservices bearing the famous mark.'\"  Lund I, 11 F. Supp. 2d at\r\n126 (quoting Ringling Bros.-Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined Shows,\r\nInc. v. Utah Div. of Travel Dev., 955 F. Supp. 605, 616 (E.D.\r\nVa. 1997)).  This, we think, is not the correct standard.  As\r\nKohler observes, demand for one product is almost always\r\nlessened whenever a competing product achieves a measurable\r\ndegree of success.  Further, blurring has to do with the\r\nidentification of a product and that is not the same thing as\r\na lessening of demand.\r\n     In addressing the dilution claim, the district court\r\nused the \"Sweet factors,\" named after the six factors set forth\r\nin Judge Sweet's concurrence in Mead Data Central, Inc. v.\r\nToyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., 875 F.2d 1026, 1035 (2d Cir.\r\n1989) (Sweet, J., concurring), which involved a claim brought\r\nunder a New York dilution statute.  Some district courts have\r\nused these factors to examine whether dilution exists under the\r\nFTDA.  See, e.g., Ringling Bros.-Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined\r\nShows, Inc. v. B.E. Windows Corp., 937 F. Supp. 204, 211-14\r\n(S.D.N.Y. 1996); WAWA, Inc. v. Haaf, 40 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1629,\r\n1632-33 (E.D. Pa. Aug. 7, 1996), aff'd, 116 F.3d 471 (3d Cir.\r\n1997); Clinique Lab., Inc. v. Dep Corp., 945 F. Supp. 547, 562\r\n(S.D.N.Y. 1996). \r\n     Kohler argues that Judge Sweet's six-factor test is\r\ninappropriate in determining whether dilution has occurred for\r\npurposes of the FTDA.  We agree.  The Sweet factors have been\r\ncriticized by both courts and commentators for introducing\r\nfactors that \"are the offspring of classical likelihood of\r\nconfusion analysis and are not particularly relevant or helpful\r\nin resolving the issues of dilution by blurring.\"  3 McCarthy\r\n 24:94.1.  The six Sweet factors are: \"1) similarity of the\r\nmarks 2) similarity of the products covered by the marks 3)\r\nsophistication of consumers 4) predatory intent 5) renown of\r\nthe senior mark [and] 6) renown of the junior mark.\"  Mead\r\nData, 875 F.2d at 1035 (Sweet, J., concurring).  McCarthy urges\r\nthat only the first and fifth of Judge Sweet's factors -- the\r\nsimilarity of the marks and the renown of the senior mark --\r\nare relevant to determining whether dilution has occurred.  See3 McCarthy  24:94.1;  see also Hershey Foods Corp. v. Mars,\r\nInc., 998 F. Supp. 500, 520 (M.D. Pa. 1998) (stating that\r\n\"whether the products are similar or not adds nothing to the\r\nanalysis\" because \"dilution can apply to competitors\"); Klieger,\r\nTrademark Dilution: The Whittling Away of the Rational Basis\r\nfor Trademark Protection, 58 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 789, 826-27\r\n(1997) (noting that \"few of these factors bear any relation to\r\nwhether a particular junior use will debilitate the selling\r\npower of a mark\" and that \"[s]o long as a mark qualifies for\r\ndilution protection and the senior and junior uses of the mark\r\nare not so unrelated as to foreclose the possibility of a\r\nmental connection, blurring . . . is a foregone conclusion\"). \r\nThese criticisms are well taken.\r\n     The district court's finding of likelihood of\r\ndilution by blurring depended on its use of inappropriate Sweet\r\nfactors.  As McCarthy points out, use of factors such as\r\npredatory intent, similarity of products, sophistication of\r\ncustomers, and renown of the junior mark work directly contrary\r\nto the intent of a law whose primary purpose was to apply in\r\ncases of widely differing goods, i.e. Kodak pianos and Kodak\r\nfilm.  See 3 McCarthy  24:94.1.\r\n     There are difficulties with the Sweet factors even\r\nwhen used with competing goods.  Blurring occurs in the minds\r\nof potential customers.  Predatory intent tells little about\r\nhow customers in fact perceive products.  That customers are\r\nsophisticated may well mean less likelihood of blurring.  That\r\ncustomers knowingly choose to pay less to get a similar\r\nproduct, and trade lower price against having a product of\r\ngreater fame, does not, contrary to Lund's argument, establish\r\nblurring.  Indeed, the district court's findings, in the\r\ninfringement context, of dissimilarity and sophistication of\r\nthe customers tend to cut against any finding of blurring.  \"The\r\nfamiliar test of similarity used in the traditional likelihood\r\nof confusion test cannot be the guide [for dilution analysis],\r\nfor likelihood of confusion is not the test of dilution.\"  Id. 24:90.1.  Instead, the inquiry is into whether target\r\ncustomers are likely to view the products \"as essentially the\r\nsame.\"  Id.\r\n     There is a more fundamental problem here in\r\nattempting to apply the dilution analysis to the design itself\r\nof the competing product involved.  We doubt that Congress\r\nintended the reach of the dilution concept under the FTDA to\r\nextend this far and our doubts are heightened by the presence\r\nof constitutional constraints.  Where words are the marks at\r\nissue it is easy to understand that there can be blurring and\r\ntarnishment when there is a completely different product to\r\nwhich the words are applied.  The congressional history\r\ndescribed earlier gives such examples.  What is much more\r\ndifficult is to see how dilution is to be shown where some of\r\na design is partially replicated and the result is largely\r\ndissimilar and does not create consumer confusion.  If that is\r\nso, as is true here, then it is difficult to see that there has\r\nbeen dilution of the source signaling function of the design\r\n(even assuming that such a function has been established\r\nthrough secondary meaning).\r\n     Instead, it appears that an entirely different issue\r\nis at stake -- not interference with the source signaling\r\nfunction but rather protection from an appropriation of or free\r\nriding on the investment Lund has made in its design.  That\r\ninvestment is usually given protection by patents, which have\r\na limited duration.  See W.T. Rogers Co., 778 F.2d at 348.  But\r\nagain, that free riding or appropriation appears to be of the\r\nbeauty of the object and not of the source, and may in fact be\r\ngood for consumers.  As the district court observed, these\r\nsophisticated buyers know a different source is involved and\r\nare, accordingly, most likely purchasing because of the\r\naesthetics. And even if there is some appropriation or free\r\nriding, the extent of it here is not clear.  Certainly it is\r\nnot plausible to think that Congress intended to protect\r\naesthetic characteristics by simply assuming harm or damages\r\nbased on the fact that the plaintiff will sell less if the\r\ndefendant sells more.  What is clear is that the interests here\r\nare not the interests at the core of what Congress intended to\r\nprotect in the FTDA.\r\n     It is possible that Congress did not really envision\r\nprotection for product design from dilution by a competing\r\nproduct under the FTDA, but the language it used does not\r\npermit us to exclude such protection categorically and rare\r\ncases can be imagined.  But a broad reading of dilution would\r\nbring us close to the constitutional edge, and we decline to\r\nattribute such brinksmanship to Congress, and so insist on\r\nrigorous review. \r\n     Under the interpretation of the fame and dilution\r\nrequirements for the FTDA set forth today, the requirements for\r\ngranting the preliminary injunction have not been met.\r\nVII.  Constitutionality of the FTDA\r\n     Kohler argues that the FTDA may never\r\nconstitutionally be applied to enjoin a competitor in a product\r\ndesign trade dress case.  Kohler's constitutional challenge\r\ninvolves two steps.  First, Kohler argues that applying the\r\nFTDA to product designs grants patent-like protections for an\r\nunlimited period of time.  Second, Kohler argues that\r\nCongress's Commerce Clause power -- the basis of Congress's\r\nregulation of trademarks and trade dress -- cannot be used to\r\ntrump the Patent Clause.  Lund responds that federal anti-\r\ndilution legislation is fully consistent with Congress's\r\nCommerce Clause power, and that patent and trademark laws\r\nprotect different interests and serve different goals.\r\n     The district court correctly noted that Kohler faced\r\na \"very high preliminary injunction standard on their\r\n[constitutional] claim,\" and that the statute was\r\n\"presumptively constitutional.\"  Lund II, 11 F. Supp. 2d at\r\n134.  The court concluded that defendant Kohler was unlikely to\r\nsucceed with its argument that the FTDA is unconstitutional in\r\nall product design contexts.\r\n     Kohler's constitutional attack on application of the\r\nFTDA here is mooted by our resolution of the injunction issue. \r\nTo the extent Kohler is mounting something akin to a facial\r\nattack, we think it better not to address constitutional issues\r\nin the abstract.  The resolution of any conflict between the\r\nPatent Clause and the FTDA is better handled on specific facts\r\nwhich present the issues with clarity, and not on the basis of\r\ntheoretical impacts. \r\nVIII.  Conclusion\r\n     Both the parties and the district court labored\r\nthrough this case without the benefit of binding precedent on\r\na number of key and difficult issues, particularly the\r\ninterpretation of the FTDA.  The denial of the preliminary\r\ninjunction on the infringement claim is affirmed.  The grant of\r\nthe injunction on the FTDA claim is vacated inasmuch as there\r\nwere no findings on functionality and standards for determining\r\nboth fame and dilution under the FTDA were used which are\r\ndifferent from those announced today and the evidence does not\r\nshow probability of success under those standards.  The case is\r\nremanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this\r\nopinion.  No costs are awarded.\r\n\n                - Concurring opinion follows -\r\n      BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, concurring.  Ordinarily the\r\ncreator of something new--a useful device, a pharmaceutical\r\ndrug, an ornament, a painting--owns any such object that he or\r\nshe makes but can prevent its replication by others only\r\npursuant to the patent and copyright laws.  A central\r\nlimitation on patent and copyright protection, stemming from\r\nthe Constitution itself, is that it is limited in time.  SeeU.S. Const. art. I,  8, cl. 8; 35 U.S.C.  101, 154 (20-year\r\nutility patent); 35 U.S.C.  171, 173 (14-year design patent);\r\n17 U.S.C.  302-304 (various limited-time copyrights).  After\r\nthe period of protection expires, copying by others is allowed. \r\nThis case presents, in addition to other problems, the threat\r\nthat the permanent injunction sought may prevent the Lund\r\nfaucet from being duplicated forever.\r\n  In substance, Lund created a faucet configuration\r\ncalled VOLA that involves a downward curving water pipe\r\nprotruding from a wall (rather than the sink itself) and a\r\nsimilarly protruding control rod to regulate both water flow\r\nand temperature (instead of the usual pair of spigots).  The\r\nconcept of a wall-based mechanism, and the size and shape and\r\nrelative proportions of the pipe and control rod, are pleasing\r\nto customers.  The resulting VOLA faucet configuration is\r\nsuccessful and recognized in the trade.\r\n  Lund has now obtained a preliminary injunction against\r\nKohler forbidding Kohler from selling Kohler's own faucet\r\nsystem that embodies the same concept and a similar but not\r\nidentically shaped pipe and control rod.  What Lund regards as\r\nthe scope of its \"monopoly\" is not entirely clear:  all we know\r\nis that this Kohler faucet system has been enjoined.  What will\r\nbe assumed, or else the legal problems would be even greater\r\nthan they are, is that the concept of a water pipe and control\r\nrod protruding from a wall is not sought to be prohibited but\r\nonly one whose shape and size are similar to VOLA.    Even so,\r\na serious problem exists because the assumed protection (if the\r\npreliminary injunction matures into a permanent one) could be\r\nperpetual.\r\n   Lund says that this perpetual protection of its design\r\nis permitted because its source is not a design patent  --Lund\r\nhas not sought one--but rather the trademark laws.  Trademarks\r\nare ordinarily conceived as names (e.g., Kodak) or marks (the\r\nAT&amp;T striped circle logo), but trademarks also include so-\r\ncalled \"trade dress,\" see 15 U.S.C.  1127; and this in turn\r\nincludes the ornamental design of an article where the design\r\nperforms the traditional \"source signaling\" function of\r\ntrademarks.  Usually, this is achieved by the \"wrapping\" (e.g.,\r\nthe classic Coca Cola bottle) or some ornament affixed to the\r\nproduct (the star symbol on the Mercedes hood); but the design\r\nof the product itself can sometimes qualify.  \r\n   A permanent restriction on copying the design of a\r\nproduct might still seem offensive to patent and copyright\r\npolicy, but at least this protection can be explained where the\r\nreplication would otherwise confuse buyers as to source,\r\ntraditionally the concern of trademark protection.  The\r\ndifficulty in this case arises because Congress has removed the\r\nrequirement of confusion for protection of \"famous\" trademarks\r\nand said that, in the alternative, they will be protected\r\nagainst \"dilution\" even where no confusion exists as to source. \r\n15 U.S.C.  1125(c).  Congress was worried that even without\r\ncustomer confusion as to source a famous trade name or mark,\r\nlike \"Kodak,\" could be blurred or degraded by being attached by\r\nothers to their own products (e.g., sports clothing, dog food). \r\nSee 141 Cong. Rec. S19306, S19310 (daily ed. Dec. 29, 1995)\r\n(statement of Sen. Hatch).\r\n   By contrast to a trademark consisting of a name or\r\ninsignia, a product design will not often qualify as a\r\ntrademark inviting protection from dilution.  A trade name or\r\ndevice usually identifies source, but the design of the product\r\nitself in most cases makes the product more efficient,\r\nattractive, or both.  If more efficient, trademark protection\r\nis foreclosed altogether under the \"functionality\" doctrine,\r\nsee Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 164; Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 775; and\r\nif attractiveness is the primary function, the product design\r\ndoes not normally qualify as a candidate to achieve secondary\r\nmeaning and thus trademark status.  See Inwood Labs., Inc. v.\r\nIves Labs., Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 851 n.11 (1982).\r\n   But conceivably in some rare case a product design\r\nmight have source signaling as its main function (perhaps the\r\nold 1950's Cadillac tail fin might be an instance) and be\r\ncopied by a competitor (say, for Volkswagen Beetles) without\r\nany risk of customer confusion.  At that point, if the new\r\ntrademark statute is taken literally, Cadillac might then claim\r\na permanent monopoly on its tail fin design, subject only to a\r\nshowing that Volkswagen's use threatened to \"dilute\" the\r\nstrength of that tail fin as a Cadillac trademark.  See 15\r\nU.S.C.  1125(c).  One may wonder whether Congress ever\r\ncontemplated such a result, but the statute's language arguably\r\npermits it or at least does not explicitly foreclose the\r\npossibility.\r\n   If so, much turns on how dilution is defined and\r\nproved.  The federal statute is recent, but state laws have\r\nprotected against dilution for some time, and under those\r\nstatutes there is some tendency to assume that dilution is\r\nthreatened wherever the famous trademark is copied.    After all,\r\nthe concern is with the long-term \"whittling away\" of the\r\nstrength of the mark by other unauthorized uses, see L.L. Bean,\r\nInc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., 811 F.2d 26, 30 (1st Cir.\r\n1987), and, absent confusion, there may be no immediate damage\r\nfrom any single use.  Where only a word or symbol is forever\r\npreempted, this protective approach toward the trademark may\r\nmake sense, and in all events does not pose much risk to the\r\npolicies of the patent and copyright clauses.\r\n   The situation is quite different where design of an\r\narticle is given permanent protection without any threat of\r\nconfusion.  If buyers prefer articles of that design, then the\r\npublic pays a price whenever the design cannot eventually be\r\nused by other manufacturers.  In the case of patents and\r\ncopyrights, the foreclosure of competition is deemed a price\r\nworth paying for a limited time--in order to induce such\r\ncreations--but only for a limited time.  Is this policy of\r\ntime-limited protection, constitutional at its core, overcome\r\nwherever dilution is threatened--even though no confusion can\r\nbe proved and any impairment of the trademark may be only\r\npotential and directed primarily to protecting the seller\r\nrather than the public?\r\n   One might point to the possible diversion of sales from\r\nLund to Kohler as practical harm in this very case.  Yet such\r\ndiversion does not prove either confusion or dilution: a copied\r\nproduct can easily take sales from the original manufacturer if\r\nthe copied product is better made or sold at a lower price or\r\nthe design is slightly better--outcomes generally beneficial to\r\nthe public.  Giving weight to diversion of sales, in the\r\nabsence of confusion of customers, simply underscores that the\r\nprotection is generally similar to that afforded for patented\r\narticles--save that the protection here may be unlimited in\r\ntime.  Giving patent-like protection a new name does not avoid\r\nconstitutional limitations.  Cf. Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder\r\nCraft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 146 (1989).\r\n   The traditional interest in trademark protection is\r\nstretched very thin in dilution cases where confusion is absent\r\nand a professed aim is to protect the maker's investment in the\r\ntrademark.  See H.R. Rep. No. 104-374, at 3 (1995), reprinted\r\nin 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1030.  And the threat to the public\r\ninterest, ordinarily countered by the time limit on patent\r\nprotection, is acute where a permanent protection is offered\r\nnot to a word or symbol but to the design of an article of\r\nmanufacture.  In such an instance, it is a difficult\r\nconstitutional question whether protecting the investment can\r\noutweigh the public interest in replication, a question best\r\ndeferred unless and until all other preconditions for\r\nprotection are resolved in favor and decision on this last\r\nissue is absolutely necessary.

The VOLA faucet mounts on a wall, has been in the design collection at the Museum of Modern Art, and has a certain cachet among those who enjoy bathrooms and kitchens beautiful.  Kohler intended to produce a faucet like Lund's, but not identical to it, and hence designed the now-enjoined Falling Water faucet.  There were two basic claims before the trial court:  that the Falling Water faucet \"diluted\" the VOLA faucet's trade dress within the meaning of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 (\"FTDA\"), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c), and that the Falling Water faucet infringed the VOLA's trade dress.  Lund won a preliminary injunction on the first ground, but not on the second.  See I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., 11 F.Supp.2d 112, 127 (D.Mass.1998) (\"Lund I \").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This difference in results was not anomalous.  The district court found, as to the infringement claim, that while the VOLA faucet was not inherently distinctive, it had acquired secondary meaning and thus was protectable, but that there was no infringement because there was no confusion on the part of consumers.  In contrast, under the FTDA, where no confusion need be shown, the court found the VOLA faucet was famous and that Kohler's faucet diluted the identity of the VOLA faucet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents complex issues arising in areas of intellectual property law recently extended and not yet well demarcated.  Few courts of appeals have yet interpreted the FTDA and this court has never addressed certain key issues, under both the infringement and FTDA claims, necessary to the resolution of the case.  The district court wrote thoughtfully, and, particularly as to the FTDA issues, without much appellate guidance.  The claim for protection here comes not from traditional marks such as names but from the very design of the faucet itself--that design is said to give the faucet its identity and distinctiveness.  Although Lund may have been able to obtain a design patent and so protect its VOLA faucet in that way, at least for a period of fourteen years, see 35 U.S.C. &#167; 173, it chose not to.  Rather, it chose to turn for protection to legal doctrines of trademark and trade dress, originally crafted without product designs in mind.  The trade dress of product designs, unlike other forms of trade dress, cannot be separated from the product itself.  Kohler has raised serious constitutional concerns, saying that this use of the FTDA against a competing product essentially gives a perpetual monopoly to product design, a perpetual monopoly prohibited by the Patent Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler and Robern (collectively \"Kohler\") argue that the district court erred in its determination that plaintiffs I.P. Lund Trading ApS and Kroin Incorporated (collectively \"Lund\") demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim under the FTDA that the Falling Water faucet dilutes the trade dress of Lund's VOLA faucet.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Lund cross-appeals, arguing that the district court erred in determining that Lund was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim.

We hold that the burden of showing non-functionality of a product for which trade dress protection is sought rests on the party seeking that protection.  Here that is the plaintiff Lund.  In analyzing inherent distinctiveness in the context of product design, we hold that while the well-known Abercrombie test provides a useful analogy, strict application of the test is not required;  we reiterate this court's adherence to the Seabrook Foods test.  We emphasize that, in any case where the trade dress is said to arise from the product design, there must be separate analyses as to (1) whether a design is inherently distinctive and (2) whether it has nonetheless acquired distinctiveness through secondary meaning.  As to secondary meaning said to stem from the design of the product itself, we hold that the plaintiff must show that the primary significance of the design is to signify its source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the FTDA, we hold that a party who wishes to establish fame of the trade dress for which protection is sought bears a significantly greater burden than the burden of establishing distinctiveness for infringement purposes.  The FTDA creates an exceptional anti-dilution remedy for truly famous marks.  Once this greater burden of establishing fame has been met under the FTDA, the issue of dilution must be addressed.  We reject the use of the \"Sweet factors\" as the test for dilution and instead require an inquiry into whether target customers will perceive the products as essentially the same.  We hold that the dilution standard is a rigorous one, and Lund has not shown that it is likely to succeed.  While we acknowledge serious constitutional concerns about application of the FTDA to a dilution claim against a competing product which does not confuse consumers, the resolution of the case obviates the as applied constitutional issue, and we decline to address any residual facial challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

The faucet, which has received numerous awards over the past quarter-century, is Lund's principal revenue-producing product.  Lund has sold a total of more than 600,000 VOLA faucets.  The faucet has been regularly advertised and featured in numerous magazines.

In 1995, Kohler purchased eight VOLA faucets from Lund for the purpose of testing the faucets to see if they fit in a sink that Kohler planned to introduce and to ensure that the faucets complied with United States regulations.  Kohler claims that it tested the faucets and found that they did not meet U.S. regulations regarding water flow capacity and resistance to hydrostatic pressure, a contention Lund contests, and as to which there was conflicting evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler gave a VOLA faucet to Erich Slothower, an industrial designer employed by Kohler.  Slothower then designed the Falling Water faucet, which Kohler introduced for sale at a price lower than that of the VOLA faucet.  Slothower testified that he examined the VOLA carefully prior to designing the Falling Water, but that he attempted to make the Falling Water faucet different from the VOLA.  Kohler's large size and well-established distribution channels mean that the Falling Water is likely to be more easily available, in addition to being less expensive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found a number of similarities between the VOLA and the Falling Water faucets.  Both are \"single-control, wall-mounted faucets\" with handles that \"utilize a thin cylindrical lever to adjust water temperature and volume\";  both have \"spouts and aerator holders ... of uniform diameter,\" with the spouts \"bend[ing] downward at right angles softened by a curve\";  and \"both faucets offer spouts in almost exactly the same three lengths.\"  Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 116.   Both faucets fit no-hole sinks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In contrast, most sinks sold in the United States are \"three-hole\" sinks, with one hole each for the water spout and the hot and cold spigots.  However, the district court also found dissimilarities between the faucets, including differences in the faucets' handles, a rounded lever on the Falling Water faucet compared to a flat lever on the VOLA, and a rounded bonnet--a piece that connects the faucet to the wall--on the mounting end of the Falling Water spout, compared to no bonnet on the VOLA.  See id.   The court also found that the housemarks, \"VOLA\" and \"Kohler,\" are clearly dissimilar and are prominently displayed on the faucets.  See id. at 123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Co-defendant Robern, which Kohler acquired in August 1995, also purchased a number of VOLA faucets.  Before being acquired by Kohler, Robern purchased 218 VOLA faucets from Kroin for use in a sink module.  Robern apparently promoted its sink module pictured with the VOLA faucets.  At approximately the same time as Kohler acquired Robern, Kroin refused to sell additional VOLA faucets to Robern, claiming that Robern was selling the faucets to Kroin's customers at prices below those Kroin was charging.  One year later, Robern announced plans to market its sink module with the Falling Water faucet.  Lund produced evidence that Robern has continued to use pictures of the VOLA in promotional materials, despite the fact that it has replaced the VOLA with the Falling Water faucet in its sink modules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler introduced the Falling Water faucet to the market in 1996.  Lund filed suit on February 27, 1997, alleging trade dress infringement under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and trade dress dilution under the FTDA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Kohler denied any violations and argued that the FTDA was unconstitutional as applied to product designs.  The district court held an evidentiary hearing on April 16 and 30, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ruled on the motion for a preliminary injunction in three stages.  In a February 5, 1998 Memorandum and Order, the court found that Lund had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on its dilution claim, and so enjoined Kohler from selling its Falling Water faucet.  See Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 127.   At the same time, the court found that Lund had failed to show likelihood of success on its claim of trade dress infringement, and it reserved decision on the question of the constitutionality of the FTDA pending additional briefing.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 12, 1998, the district court stayed the preliminary injunction pending resolution of Kohler's claim that application of the FTDA to product designs violates the Patent Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an order dated March 31, 1998 and a memorandum dated April 2, 1998, the district court found that Kohler's constitutional argument was unlikely to succeed on the merits, lifted the stay on the injunction, and ordered Lund to post a bond of $250,000.  See I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., 11 F.Supp.2d 127, 134-35 (D.Mass.1998) (\"Lund II \").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also denied Kohler's request to stay the injunction pending appeal to this court.

Purposes of Trademark and Trade Dress Protection</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic building blocks of the analysis are worth reiterating.  Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act provides protection against the use of \"any word, term, name, symbol, or device\" that \"is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\" as to the source of a product.  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a).  Trade dress includes \"the design and appearance of [a] product together with the elements making up the overall image that serves to identify the product presented to the consumer.\"  Chrysler Corp. v. Silva, 118 F.3d 56, 58 (1st Cir.1997) (alteration in original) (quoting Fun-Damental Too, Ltd. v. Gemmy Indus. Corp., 111 F.3d 993, 999 (2d Cir.1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The new law, the FTDA, Lanham Act section 43(c), grants protection to \"famous\" marks against any use of the mark that \"causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To resolve the issues presented, we go back to the underlying purposes of trademark and trade dress infringement and dilution protections.  The various intellectual property protection mechanisms serve related but distinct ends.  These distinct ends inform the selection of appropriate tests under the different sections of the Lanham Act.  These distinctions are also particularly pertinent to Kohler's constitutional claim that dilution protection of trade dress of product design amounts to an unconstitutional perpetual monopoly under the Patent Clause of the Constitution.  The Patent Clause itself describes the \"exclusive Right\" given as being for \"limited Times.\"   U.S. Const. art.  I, &#167; 8, cl. 8.  \"The laws of patents, copyright, trade secrets, trademarks, unfair competition, and misappropriation balance the conflicting interests in protection and dissemination differently in different contexts through specific rules that determine just who will receive protection, of just what kind, under what circumstances, and for how long.\"  DeCosta v. Viacom Int'l, Inc., 981 F.2d 602, 605 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A primary purpose of trade dress or trademark protection is to protect that which identifies a product's source.  See Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co., 514 U.S. 159, 162, 115 S.Ct. 1300, 131 L.Ed.2d 248 (1995) (noting that \"the statutory definition of a trademark ... requires that a person 'us[e]' or 'inten[d] to use' the mark 'to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown' \" (alterations in original) (quoting 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1127)).  \"The purpose of trademark laws is to prevent the use of the same or similar marks in a way that confuses the public about the actual source of the goods or service.\"  Star Fin.  Servs., Inc. v. Aastar Mortgage Corp., 89 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir.1996).  Traditional trademark and trade dress law thus encourages production of products of high quality \"and simultaneously discourages those who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on a consumer's inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale.\"  Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 164, 115 S.Ct. 1300.   More importantly for our purposes, trademark and trade dress protection serves to protect both the trademark or trade dress owner and the public by avoiding confusion or mistake.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, dilution statutes, and the FTDA in particular, protect only the trademark or trade dress owner and are not concerned with possible confusion on the part of consumers.  See J. Gilson, Trademark Protection and Practice &#167; 5.12 (1998).  Any protection of the public intended by the FTDA is indirect at best.  \"Anti-dilution statutes have developed to fill a void left by the failure of trademark infringement law to curb the unauthorized use of marks where there is no likelihood of confusion between the original use and the infringing use.\"  L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., 811 F.2d 26, 30 (1st Cir.1987).  Filling this void, Congress passed the FTDA in 1995 both to provide uniform national protection against dilution and to bring this country's law into conformity with international agreements.  See H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3-4 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N 1029, 1030-31.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>IV. Prerequisites for Protection from Infringement and Dilution</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite different purposes being served, claims for protection against trademark and trade dress infringement, on the one hand, and dilution, on the other, share three common elements before the analyses diverge.  Those elements are that marks (a) must be used in commerce, (b) must be non-functional, and (c) must be distinctive.  While all such marks may be protected against infringement, under the FTDA only famous and distinctive marks are eligible for protection against dilution.  No requirement for fame is present in trademark and trade dress infringement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Use in Commerce</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that both Lund's and Kohler's faucets have been used in commerce, thus satisfying the first requirement for protection against both infringement and dilution.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a),(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Functionality</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Legal Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be protected under the Lanham Act, a trademark or trade dress must not be functional.  See Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 775, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992).  If the trade dress is functional, it receives no protection under trademark law.  The functionality doctrine has considerable economic and legal significance.  \"The functionality doctrine prevents trademark law, which seeks to promote competition by protecting a firm's reputation, from instead inhibiting legitimate competition by allowing a producer to control a useful product feature.\"  Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 164, 115 S.Ct. 1300.   Thus, the functionality doctrine marks the boundaries of trade dress protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed later, \"if functional features were given trademark or trade dress protection, such protection would clearly clash with the objectives of federal functional patent law.\"   1 J. McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition &#167; 7:64 (4th ed.1996).  The rule against functional features being protected as symbols of origin \"is obviously to prevent the grant of perpetual monopoly by the issuance of a trade-mark in the situation where a patent has either expired, or ... cannot be granted.\"  Sylvania Elec. Prods., Inc. v. Dura Elec. Lamp Co., 247 F.2d 730, 732 (3d Cir.1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The core inquiry into whether trade dress is functional requires examination of the effects that granting protection to a product will have on the ability of others to compete.  Thus, in Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982), the Court stated that a functional product feature is one that \"is essential to the use or purpose of the article or [that] ... affects the cost or quality of the article.\"  Id. at 851 n. 10, 102 S.Ct. 2182.  In Qualitex, the Court added that the inquiry into functionality turns in part on whether granting protection to a mark \"would permit one competitor ... to interfere with legitimate (nontrademark-related) competition through actual or potential exclusive use of an important product ingredient.\"  Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 170, 115 S.Ct. 1300.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that a product contains some functional elements does not, however, preclude Lanham Act protection.  \"[A] particular arbitrary combination of functional features, the combination of which is not itself functional, properly enjoys protection.\"  Taco Cabana Int'l, Inc. v. Two Pesos, Inc., 932 F.2d 1113, 1119 (5th Cir.1991), aff'd, 505 U.S. 763, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992).  The crucial inquiry is into the effect that granting protection will have on the opportunity of others to compete.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the parties note, this court has not previously decided whether a showing of non-functionality is an element of the claim of the party seeking protection, or whether functionality is an affirmative defense on which the defending party has the burden.  See TEC Eng'g Corp., 82 F.3d at 546 n. 3. In Fisher Stoves, Inc. v. All Nighter Stove Works, Inc., 626 F.2d 193 (1st Cir.1980), this court, although not resolving the issue, stated that it was \"not at all clear\" that the district court erred when it placed the burden of proof on the plaintiff.  Id. at 195.   Other circuit courts which have decided the issue are split.  Compare Sunbeam Prods., Inc. v. West Bend Co., 123 F.3d 246, 251 (5th Cir.1997) (holding that plaintiffs bear the burden), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 1795, 140 L.Ed.2d 936 (1998), Woodsmith Publishing Co. v. Meredith Corp., 904 F.2d 1244, 1247 (8th Cir.1990), Rachel v. Banana Republic, Inc., 831 F.2d 1503, 1506 (9th Cir.1987), AmBrit, Inc. v. Kraft, Inc., 812 F.2d 1531, 1535 (11th Cir.1986), Kwik-Site Corp. v. Clear View Mfg. Co., 758 F.2d 167, 178 (6th Cir.1985), and CIBA-GEIGY Corp. v. Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., 747 F.2d 844, 854 (3d Cir.1984), with Computer Care v. Service Sys. Enters., Inc., 982 F.2d 1063, 1068 (7th Cir.1992) (holding that defendants bear the burden), Brunswick Corp. v. Spinit Reel Co., 832 F.2d 513, 520 (10th Cir.1987), and LeSportsac, Inc. v. K Mart Corp., 754 F.2d 71, 75-76 (2d Cir.1985).  See generally 1 McCarthy &#167; 7:72.  The Lanham Act itself provides no guidance on the issue, and the caselaw contains little discussion of the rationale for allocating the burden of proof to plaintiffs or defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the party alleging trademark infringement and dilution bears the burden of proving non-functionality of those elements of the physical object that the plaintiff claims constitute the mark and for which the plaintiff is seeking protection.  Several rationales support the burden being placed on those seeking protection, here the plaintiff.  Functionality, or, more precisely, a showing of non-functionality of the elements for which protection is sought, is an essential component of the protection the law gives to trademarks and trade dress.  A showing of non-functionality is essential because the doctrine prevents trademarks from limiting legitimate competition.  Put differently, \"functionality\" plays an important role in preventing a constitutional problem between the Lanham Act and patent law.  Moreover, Congress did not intend to provide Lanham Act protection to functional aspects of products, see Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 775, 112 S.Ct. 2753, and thus it would be anomalous if the burden were not placed on the party seeking protection.  Such an assignment of the burden of proof ensures that trademarks serve their intended purpose of identifying product sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff's product is known best by plaintiff itself.  A contrary result, placing the burden on defendant, could lead to untoward results.  It could also lead to unwarranted litigation.  If protected elements of a product are indeed functional, and the burden of showing non-functionality is placed on plaintiff, plaintiff will have incentives not to bring unwarranted actions hoping that defendants will fail to raise or prove functionality as an affirmative defense.  It would be far easier for plaintiffs to obtain protection for functional aspects of their products--and thus limit legitimate competition--if defendants were to bear the burden of proof, as defendants might lack the ability or incentive to pursue the issue fully.  There is value in minimizing the chances of the issue not being properly raised or presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Application of Functionality Doctrine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not make a specific finding on functionality and the record on the important issue of functionality is unclear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Although Lund I commented that \"[n]o one argues that the VOLA design is 'functional,' as that term is used in trademark law,\" Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 120 n. 12, Kohler did in fact argue in a filing that \"to the extent that some features on the respective faucets may somewhat resemble each other, these features are either functional in nature and thus not protectable under the Lanham Act or so commonly used in the plumbing industry that they are obvious--not distinctive of a particular product\" (emphasis added).  Thus Kohler did not waive the issue.  We cannot say that it is obvious no aspect of the VOLA is functional;  indeed some aspects give the appearance of being functional and so the issue is a real one.  There are significant dissimilarities between the two faucets, and at least some of the similarities that do exist are suggestive of functionality.  Nonetheless, we will assume at this stage of the case that there is some non-functional residuum based on the aesthetic unity and proportions of the VOLA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of functionality plays a key role in this case.  In the absence of a finding of non-functionality of the aspects of the VOLA for which protection is sought, and in light of our placing the burden of proof on plaintiff, there can be no trademark or trade dress protection.  If the VOLA design or aspects of it are functional, then the only source of exclusive rights would be in a utility patent.  Trademark and trade dress law cannot be used to evade the requirements of utility patents, nor the limits on monopolies imposed by the Patent Clause.  This also means that in the absence of a finding of non-functionality, no protection is available under the FTDA and no injunction may issue under the FTDA, a point to which we return later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But there is another reason that the functionality analysis must be undertaken.  There is a relationship between functionality and distinctiveness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>If a feature is functional, it is likely that all similar articles will have a similar functional feature, and one seller's feature is not likely to evoke any response in buyers that it is unique or is a distinctive symbol of origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 McCarthy &#167; 7:64.  It is also clear that even if a functional feature has achieved secondary meaning as an indication of origin, that feature is not protectable under trademark or trade dress law.  See Fisher Stoves, 626 F.2d at 195-96;  1 McCarthy &#167; 7:66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Distinctiveness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third prerequisite for protection is distinctiveness.  In order to receive trade dress protection, a product must either be inherently distinctive or have acquired secondary meaning.  See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769, 112 S.Ct. 2753;  TEC Eng'g Corp., 82 F.3d at 545.   The inquiry into distinctiveness turns on the total appearance of the product, not on individual elements.  Cf. Sunbeam, 123 F.3d at 251 (stating that \" 'trade dress' refers to the total image and overall appearance of a product\").  The district court found, within the usual preliminary injunction standards about likelihood of success, that the VOLA faucet was not inherently distinctive but that it had acquired secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Inherently Distinctive Marks</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In analyzing whether a product's mark is distinctive, courts have often divided marks into the five categories set forth in Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4 (2d Cir.1976):  (1) generic, (2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, (4) arbitrary, and (5) fanciful.  See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753 (discussing Abercrombie );  Abercrombie, 537 F.2d at 9. Suggestive, arbitrary, and fanciful marks are deemed inherently distinctive;  descriptive marks receive protection only upon a showing that they have acquired secondary meaning;  and generic marks are not protectable.  Abercrombie itself addressed words, the usual form of mark.  The Abercrombie test has been used in some other areas of trade dress, such as product packaging and the overall appearance of a restaurant.  See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768-69, 773, 112 S.Ct. 2753.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have struggled with whether the Abercrombie test, originally designed for words, should be imported wholesale into that specialized area of trade dress claimed to come from product design.  Although the Supreme Court in Two Pesos endorsed the Abercrombie test in the context of non-verbal trade dress not involving product designs, at least two circuits have been skeptical of the appropriateness of the test in the product design context.  See Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd., 71 F.3d 996, 1007-08 (2d Cir.1995);  Duraco Prods., Inc. v. Joy Plastic Enters., Ltd., 40 F.3d 1431, 1445-49 (3d Cir.1994);  1 McCarthy &#167; 8:12.  Indeed, these courts, questioning whether a product design can ever be inherently distinctive, apply a more rigorous standard for determining inherent distinctiveness of product designs than they do for determining the inherent distinctiveness of more traditional forms of trade dress.  See Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1008-09 (requiring that a product design serve primarily to indicate a product's source);  Duraco Prods., 40 F.3d at 1449 (requiring product designs to be \"(i) unusual and memorable;  (ii) conceptually separable from the product;  and (iii) likely to serve primarily as a designator of origin of the product\").  The problem with applying traditional trademark or trade dress classifications to product designs arises because \"one cannot automatically conclude from a product feature or configuration--as one can from a product's arbitrary name ...--that, to a consumer, it functions primarily to denote the product's source.\"  Duraco Prods., 40 F.3d at 1441.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parting from the skeptics, the Eighth Circuit has rejected any differentiation between product designs and other forms of trade dress.  See Stuart Hall Co. v. Ampad Corp., 51 F.3d 780, 787-88 (8th Cir.1995).  The Stuart Hall court argued that the Second and Third Circuit tests would effectively eliminate the possibility that a product design could be inherently distinctive, collapsing the inherent distinctiveness inquiry into the secondary meaning inquiry.  See id. at 787 (\"The requirement of source-identification applies not to whether a trade dress is inherently distinctive, but to whether it has a secondary meaning.\").  Such an outcome would directly contradict the Supreme Court's holding in Two Pesos that inherently distinctive trade dress is protectable even absent a showing of secondary meaning.  See id. at 788 (citing Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769-70, 112 S.Ct. 2753).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court here applied the Second Circuit's Knitwaves test.  It examined whether the VOLA's design was \"likely to serve primarily as a designator of origin of the product.\"  Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 120 (quoting Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1008) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Like the court in Knitwaves, the district court did so by looking to whether the VOLA's creators intended the design to serve as a source indicator.  See id.;   see also Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1009 (\"As Knitwaves' objective in the two sweater designs was primarily aesthetic, the designs were not primarily intended as source identification.  Those sweater designs therefore fail to qualify for protection of trade dress inherent in product design.\").  The court found that the VOLA's design was \"not 'primarily' intended as source identification\" because \"Lund's design objective was 'primarily aesthetic,' \" and thus \"the design of the VOLA faucet cannot be considered inherently distinctive.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund argues that the district court was in error because it was obligated by Supreme Court precedent to apply the Abercrombie test.  Lund argues that application of the wrong test produced the wrong result.  Lund points to other decisions in the District of Massachusetts which have rejected the Knitwaves and Duraco Products tests and adopted the Abercrombie analysis in the product design context.  See Big Top USA, Inc. v. Wittern Group, 998 F.Supp. 30, 46-47 (D.Mass.1998);  Lainer v. Bandwagon, Inc., 983 F.Supp. 292, 300 (D.Mass.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not believe that the Supreme Court's endorsement of the Abercrombie test in Two Pesos requires a strict application of the Abercrombie test in all contexts, particularly where product design is involved.  The Supreme Court stated only that \"[m]arks are often classified in\" the five Abercrombie categories.  Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753.   The Court did not mandate the application of the Abercrombie test;  rather, it affirmed the use of the Abercrombie factors in the case before it.  See id. at 768-69, 112 S.Ct. 2753.   The holding of Two Pesos was that plaintiffs seeking protection for inherently distinctive trade dress are not required to demonstrate secondary meaning.  See id. at 770, 112 S.Ct. 2753.   Unless the Court decides to carve out an exception to this rule for claims about product design, which we deem unlikely, then the holding must be honored.  And so we agree with the Eighth Circuit that the test for inherent distinctiveness should not be altered to the degree that it eviscerates the distinction between inherently distinctive trade dress and trade dress that has acquired secondary meaning.  We do not believe, however, that analysis of the problem using different factors than the Abercrombie factors results in such an outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has previously relied on the test set forth in Seabrook Foods, Inc. v. Bar-Well Foods Ltd., 568 F.2d 1342 (C.C.P.A.1977), to determine whether a product design is inherently distinctive, and we do so again.  In Wiley v. American Greetings Corp., 762 F.2d 139 (1st Cir.1985), this court stated that inherent distinctiveness of a product design should be determined by reference to</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>whether [the design] was a \"common\" basic shape or design, whether it was unique or unusual in a particular field, whether it was a mere refinement of a commonly-adopted and well-known form of ornamentation for a particular class of goods viewed by the public as dress or ornamentation for the goods, or whether it was capable of creating a commercial impression distinct from the accompanying words.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 141 (alteration in original) (quoting Seabrook Foods, 568 F.2d at 1344) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We also agree with one commentator's analysis that \"[i]n reality, all three [Seabrook Foods ] questions are merely different ways to ask whether the design, shape or combination of elements is so unique, unusual or unexpected in this market that one can assume without proof that it will automatically be perceived by customers as an indicator of origin--a trademark.\"  1 McCarthy &#167; 8:13.  Although the plaintiff in Wiley brought suit under state common law, we find the test equally applicable to claims brought under the Lanham Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Seabrook Foods test is largely consistent with the Second Circuit's Knitwaves test for inherent distinctiveness, that is, whether the design \"is likely to serve primarily as a designator of origin of the product.\"  Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1008 (quoting Duraco Prods., 40 F.3d at 1449) (internal quotation marks omitted);  see also Landscape Forms, Inc. v. Columbia Cascade Co., 113 F.3d 373, 378 n. 3 (2d Cir.1997) (rejecting an argument that the Knitwaves and Seabrook Foods tests are inconsistent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the Second Circuit, however, we believe that Two Pesos obliges courts to maintain a clear distinction between the inquiry into secondary meaning and the inquiry into inherent distinctiveness.  Cf. Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1008.   Although plaintiffs seeking to demonstrate that a product design is inherently distinctive may find that their task is a difficult one, Two Pesos makes clear that this opportunity remains open.  Product designs are unlike many more traditional subjects of trademark protection, \"which almost automatically tell a customer that they refer to a brand,\" Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 162-63, 115 S.Ct. 1300, and it is therefore unlikely that many product designs will be found to be inherently distinctive.  Nevertheless, plaintiffs seeking trade dress protection for product designs are entitled to attempt to show that their designs are so unique as to be primarily perceived as indicating the product's origin.  Cf. 2 McCarthy &#167; 15:9 (\"A design or shape, or a trade dress that is so fanciful as to be inherently distinctive can function as a mark without the need for proof of secondary meaning.  The issue is whether this shape is so different or unusual for this type of goods or services that its distinctiveness can be assumed.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying Knitwaves, the district court did make a finding as to inherent distinctiveness.  It found that the VOLA's design is not \"likely to serve primarily as a designator of origin of the product.\"   On this record that finding cannot be said to be clearly erroneous.  One aspect of the test applied in reaching this conclusion is, nonetheless, problematic.  The district court relied on evidence as to Lund's intent.  But the plaintiff's intent is not entitled to much weight in a determination of whether a product design is inherently distinctive.  See 1 McCarthy &#167; 8.13 (stating that \"the intent of the designer is a very weak indicator of the likely reaction of potential customers\");  cf.  Landscape Forms, 113 F.3d at 377 n. 3 (\"If Knitwaves forced courts to decide whether a manufacturer's purpose was to create either something of beauty or something indicative of source, we agree the task would often prove impossible.\").  The district court may, however, have given little weight to this factor in reaching its conclusion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court used the Knitwaves test, which is consistent with this Circuit's Wiley /Seabrook test, to reach its conclusion.  There is adequate evidence in the record to support the district court's determination there was little probability of success in demonstrating that the VOLA's design inherently and primarily serves to identify the faucet's source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Secondary Meaning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second method for demonstrating that a product's trademark or trade dress is distinctive and thus protectable is through a showing that the mark has acquired secondary meaning.  \"To establish secondary meaning, a manufacturer must show that, in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself.\"  Inwood Laboratories, 456 U.S. at 851 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. 2182.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While some have suggested that the primary significance test is too stringent, particularly for product design cases, we reject any lesser test.  The Supreme Court has consistently used \"primary significance.\"   As the Court said in a case concerning a product design (the shape of a shredded wheat cereal biscuit), secondary meaning occurs when \"the primary significance ... in the minds of the consuming public is not the product but the producer.\"  Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U.S. 111, 118, 59 S.Ct. 109, 83 L.Ed. 73 (1938).  Where protection of the product design itself is at issue, there is every reason to hold to the usual stringent primary significance test in order to minimize constitutional concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Secondary meaning may be \"established in a number of ways,\" and courts may weigh a number of factors, including the length or exclusivity of use of a mark, \"the size or prominence of [plaintiff's] enterprise,\" and the existence of substantial advertising by plaintiff.  President &amp; Trustees of Colby College v. Colby College-New Hampshire, 508 F.2d 804, 807-08 (1st Cir.1975).  Other factors include the product's \"[e]stablished place in the market\" and \"[p]roof of intentional copying.\"  2 McCarthy &#167; 15:30;  see also Boston Beer Co. Ltd. Partnership v. Slesar Bros. Brewing Co., 9 F.3d 175, 182 (1st Cir.1993) (listing factors).  Secondary meaning may be determined with reference to a particular trade or \"branch of the purchasing public.\"   See Colby College, 508 F.2d at 808 (quoting G. &amp; C. Merriam Co. v. Saalfield, 198 F. 369, 373 (6th Cir.1912)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Lund had a likelihood of success of showing that the VOLA had achieved secondary meaning, noting that \"there is sufficient evidence in the record ... to conclude that purchasers of high-end bathroom fixtures, including interior designers, now know the VOLA by sight.\"  Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 121.   The district court also found that \"[e]nough money and effort has been invested in promoting the VOLA's design that it is recognizable as coming from a unique source, albeit through a variety of distributors,\" and that \"the primary significance of the VOLA design, to the relevant public, is as a high-end product, coming from Lund.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler challenges the district court's determination that the VOLA has most likely acquired secondary meaning.  We review the district court's findings of fact for clear error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's conclusion is doubtful for several reasons.  First, as noted, there was no analysis of functionality and there is a relationship between functionality and secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the context suggests otherwise--the district court found, under separate but related doctrines, that the faucets were mostly dissimilar.  Cf. 2 McCarthy &#167; 15:38 (stating that copying may give rise to an inference of secondary meaning).  The court found that there was no customer confusion.  It is in this barren context that the claim is made that something in the design which is not functional serves primarily to signify the source of the faucet and not primarily to signify that it is an aesthetically pleasing faucet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, little is present of the evidence traditionally relied on (but which admittedly is not a sine qua non) for a finding of secondary meaning.  The secondary meaning analysis is primarily a subjective one, looking into the minds of potential customers.  Customer survey evidence, while not required, is a valuable method of showing secondary meaning.  See Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan, 867 F.2d 22, 32 n. 9 (1st Cir.1989);  Colby College, 508 F.2d at 809.   As the district court correctly noted, the purported survey evidence was unreliable.  The expert testimony, which involved one expert testifying for each side, was contradictory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the VOLA has been sold by a number of different companies in this country and has not been advertised here as coming from Lund.  This situation is akin to the use of different marks to identify a single product.  \"When a product ... design is sold by the authority of plaintiff under several different word marks ..., it is more difficult for plaintiff to prove acquisition of secondary meaning--that is, that the shape or design identifies a single source.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  1 McCarthy &#167; 8:14 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, while such testimony is entitled to little weight because the focus is on the understanding of prospective purchasers, the testimony is that Lund did not intend in designing the product that the design signify source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the VOLA product has been much advertised or featured, but at times without any source attribution or with attribution to different sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund relies heavily on the testimony of Corbin, a retailer presented as Lund's expert.  Corbin stated that the VOLA was \"perceived as a high-end product, a very simple and elegant product;  one that is generally known by name as either a Kroin faucet or Jacobsen faucet;  ...  a design icon....\"  But to say it is a design success is not to say that the primary significance of the design is to signify its source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end we need not resolve the point.  Lund lost on the infringement preliminary injunction and for other reasons, even if Lund had shown secondary meaning, it has not shown itself entitled to relief under the FTDA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Infringement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Establishing trademark infringement requires a showing that prospective buyers of the product in question--here, high-end faucets--are likely to be confused as to the product's source.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a);  Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769, 112 S.Ct. 2753;  TEC Eng'g Corp., 82 F.3d at 545;  Purolator, Inc. v. EFRA Distribs., Inc., 687 F.2d 554, 559 (1st Cir.1982);  cf.  International Ass'n of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers v. Winship Green Nursing Ctr., 103 F.3d 196, 201 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[T]he law has long demanded a showing that the allegedly infringing conduct carries with it a likelihood of confounding an appreciable number of reasonably prudent purchasers exercising ordinary care.\").  Establishing infringement also requires a showing that the plaintiff uses, and thus owns, the mark in question, and that the defendant's mark is similar to or the same as the plaintiff's mark.  See DeCosta, 981 F.2d at 605.   A plaintiff is not entitled to a preliminary injunction on a trademark infringement claim unless it can persuade the district court that it is likely to be able to demonstrate consumer confusion.  See WCVB-TV v. Boston Athletic Ass'n, 926 F.2d 42, 44 (1st Cir.1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has identified eight factors to be weighed in determining likelihood of confusion:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>(1) the similarity of the marks;  (2) the similarity of the goods;  (3) the relationship between the parties' channels of trade;  (4) the relationship between the parties' advertising;  (5) the classes of prospective purchasers;  (6) evidence of actual confusion;  (7) the defendant's intent in adopting its mark;  and (8) the strength of the plaintiff's mark....  No one factor is necessarily determinative, but each must be considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston Athletic Ass'n, 867 F.2d at 29 (quoting Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Wheeler, 814 F.2d 812, 817 (1st Cir.1987)) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The factors are non-exclusive, however, and are not always apt to the particular facts of a case.  See Winship Green, 103 F.3d at 201.   In addition, the first factor, similarity, \"is determined on the basis of the total effect of the designation, rather than a comparison of individual features.\"  Pignons S.A. de Mecanique de Precision v. Polaroid Corp., 657 F.2d 482, 487 (1st Cir.1981) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court applied these eight factors and determined that, taken together, the factors weighed against a finding of a likelihood of consumer confusion.  The court found that the strength of the VOLA's mark and the similarity of the VOLA and the Falling Water products were factors that favored the plaintiffs, but that the class of prospective purchasers, the channels of trade, the defendant's intent, and the dissimilarity of the VOLA and Falling Water marks all favored the defendants.  The court found that the two remaining factors did not weigh in favor of either party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund argues that the district court misapplied the eight factors listed above, saying the court committed four errors.  First, Lund argues that the district court accorded consumer sophistication excessive weight, particularly in reaching its determination that the channels of trade and the classes of prospective consumers made confusion less likely.  Second, Lund argues that the court erred in its determination that the dissimilarity of the marks weighed against a finding of consumer confusion.  Third, Lund argues that the district court erred when it found that Kohler's intention not to copy the VOLA weighed against a finding of consumer confusion.  Fourth, Lund argues that the district court ignored evidence of actual consumer confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of factual determinations is for clear error.  We have carefully considered each of Lund's arguments, and are unpersuaded that the district court's determination as to the probability of success on each of these points was erroneous.  However, we clarify two matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, little weight should be given to the determination that Kohler did not intend to copy the VOLA.  In Chrysler, this court commented that \"[s]trictly, intent, or lack thereof, does not affect the eyes of the viewer.\"  Chrysler, 118 F.3d at 59 n. 3. We added that \"[p]roof of bad intent may, psychologically, hurt as an admission,\" but \"[p]roof of good intent does not change appearance.\"  Id. Similarly, in Star Financial Services we commented that \"a finding of good faith is no answer if likelihood of confusion is otherwise established.\"  Star Fin.  Servs., 89 F.3d at 11 (quoting Colby College, 508 F.2d at 811-12) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus a finding of no intent to copy may not outweigh other factors that suggest a likelihood of confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court's discussion of post-sale confusion was based on an erroneous premise.  In finding that post-sale confusion was unlikely, the court commented that \"there is little or no chance that [the faucets] will be resold to unwary consumers.\"  Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 123.   Post-sale confusion refers not to the resale of the original product, however, but to the risk that non-purchasers, who themselves may be future consumers, will be deceived.  See 3 McCarthy &#167; 23:7 (noting that \"[t]he damage to the senior user ... is that consumers could acquire the prestige value of the senior user's product by buying the copier's cheap imitation,\" and that in such a case, \"[e]ven though the knowledgeable buyer knew that it was getting an imitation, viewers would be confused\").  For example, in a case involving counterfeit Rolex watches, the court commented that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>[i]ndividuals examining the counterfeits, believing them to be genuine Rolex watches, might find themselves unimpressed with the quality of the item and consequently be inhibited from purchasing the real time piece.  Others who see the watches bearing the Rolex trademarks on so many wrists might find themselves discouraged from acquiring a genuine because the items have become too common place and no longer possess the prestige once associated with them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rolex Watch U.S.A., Inc. v. Canner, 645 F.Supp. 484, 495 (S.D.Fla.1986).  In other words, even if the purchaser of a Falling Water faucet knew that she was buying the Kohler faucet and not the VOLA, the district court could still find a likelihood of confusion if subsequent viewers of the faucet would believe it to be a VOLA.  Cf. Keds Corp. v. Renee Int'l Trading Corp., 888 F.2d 215, 222 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that \"point of sale confusion was not the only issue\" because \"prospective consumers, viewing the clothes on other people, would be confused as to the origin of the goods\").  However, because the district court's determination of no likelihood of post-sale confusion does not appear to have been a key factor in its decision, we do not believe it undercuts the court's conclusion regarding probability of success on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly found that Lund was unlikely to prevail on the merits of its infringement claim, and so correctly denied the preliminary injunction on those grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. Dilution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund obtained the preliminary injunction against Kohler's distribution and promotion of the Falling Water faucet based on the district court's finding of likelihood of success under the new federal anti-dilution statute, the FTDA, which became effective in 1996.  The injunction rested on the conclusion that Lund had established a likelihood of success of showing two essential elements.  The first is that the \"mark,\" that is, the VOLA product design as an identifying mark, was \"famous.\"   The second is that Kohler's Falling Water faucet \"diluted\" Lund's mark.  Both the terms \"famous\" and \"dilution\" are terms of art given specific rigorous meanings by the FTDA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the language of the Act.

Congress acted against a \"patch-quilt system\" of state law protection in which approximately twenty-five states had laws prohibiting trademark dilution.  Id. While creating a federal cause of action, Congress expressly did not preempt state law, but attempted to create uniformity through the availability of a federal cause of action.  A second consideration--protection of famous marks of U.S. companies abroad--also motivated Congress.  See id. at 4, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N at 1031.   Enactment of the FTDA was consistent with agreements which were part of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (specifically, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, including Trade in Counterfeit Goods (\"TRIPS\")) and the Paris Convention.  Enactment of the law was also thought to be of value to the U.S. in bilateral and multi-lateral trade negotiations.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sponsors of the bill articulated the type of problem the Act was meant to solve:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p>[T]his bill is designed to protect famous trademarks from subsequent uses that blur the distinctiveness of the mark or tarnish or disparage it, even in the absence of a likelihood of confusion.  Thus, for example, the use of DuPont shoes, Buick aspirin, and Kodak pianos would be actionable under this bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">141 Cong. Rec.  S19306, S19310 (daily ed. Dec. 29, 1995) (statement of Sen.  Hatch).  Thus the archetypal problems involved non-competing products as to which there could, by definition, be no confusion and a world-famous brand name which was either tarnished or blurred by its application to a different product which was obviously trading on the good will of that name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the FTDA itself is, however, not limited to addressing these archetypal problems.  A few observations are in order.  First, the Act applies to products which are competitors (as is true of the faucets here) as well as to products which are totally dissimilar and are not competitors.  Second, the Act applies to a famous \"mark\" and does not restrict the definition of that term to names or traditional marks.  In the absence of such a restriction, the Act applies to all types of marks recognized by the Lanham Act, including marks derived from product designs.  Kohler's argument that the Act cannot, as a matter of statutory interpretation, be applied to product design is rejected.  Third, the Act applies even where there is no customer confusion, a point with consequences discussed later.  Fourth, the additional protection afforded by the Act requires that a mark go beyond what is required for ordinary Lanham Act protection.  Only those marks which are \"distinctive and famous\" are protected.  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c)(1).  As set forth in the 1987 Trademark Review Commission Report, the precursor of the 1996 Act, this language reflected \"the policy goal that to be protected, a mark had to be truly prominent and renowned.\"  3 McCarthy &#167; 24.91 (citing The United States Trademark Association Trademark Review Commission Report and Recommendations to USTA President and Board of Directors, 77 Trademark Rep. 375, 459-60 (1987)).  With this background, we turn to the district court's two essential conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Fame and Distinctiveness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirements of commercial use, non-functionality, and distinctiveness are common to both the infringement claim and the FTDA dilution claim.  In order to fall within the sphere of protection against dilution the FTDA adds an additional requirement:  the FTDA grants protection only to famous marks.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c);  cf. Gilson &#167; 5.12[a] (calling the FTDA \"a major breakthrough for an elite category of trademark owners\").  The FTDA provides a non-exclusive list of eight factors that courts should consider in determining whether a mark is \"distinctive and famous.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c)(1).  The eight statutory factors are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p>(A) the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p>(B) the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods or services with which the mark is used;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p>(C) the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p>(D) the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>(E) the channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p>(F) the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade used by the marks' owner and the person against whom the injunction is sought;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p>(G) the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third parties;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p>(H) whether the mark was registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. The district court found likelihood of success on the claim that the VOLA's design was a famous mark.  Kohler challenges this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the text and legislative history of the original bill in 1988 and the FTDA itself indicate a congressional intent that courts should be discriminating and selective in categorizing a mark as famous.  For example, the Senate Judiciary Committee Report on the 1988 precursor bill<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> said the Committee wished \"to underscore its determination that the new dilution provisions should apply only to ... very unique marks.\"  3 McCarthy &#167; 24:92 n. 6 (quoting S.Rep. No. 100-515, at 41-42) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Trademark Review Commission noted that the showing of fame required employment of a \"higher standard\" than fame among an \"appreciable number of persons\" in order to be \"eligible for this extraordinary remedy.\"   Id. n. 8 (quoting The United States Trademark Association Trademark Review Commission Report, 77 Trademark Rep. at 461) (internal quotation marks omitted).  One commentator has referred to this category of famous marks as \"Supermark[s].\"  See Gilson &#167; 5.12[a]. As the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition notes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p>A mark that evokes an association with a specific source only when used in connection with the particular goods or services that it identifies is ordinarily not sufficiently distinctive to be protected against dilution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition &#167; 25 cmt. e (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here reflects that there was not sufficient attention paid to the heightened fame standard that the FTDA establishes.  The district court found that \"in its market, the VOLA's design is famous and distinctive\" based on its prior analysis under the infringement claim that \"the VOLA mark is strong, and has acquired secondary meaning in its market;  and it has been used for some twenty years in this country.\"  Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 125.   Both the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition and the state anti-dilution statutes against the background of which Congress enacted the FTDA make clear that the standard for fame and distinctiveness required to obtain anti-dilution protection is more rigorous than that required to seek infringement protection.  See Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition &#167; 25 cmt. e. As one commentator has stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>Certainly, the mere acquisition of secondary meaning to achieve trademark status in a non-inherently distinctive designation is nowhere near sufficient to achieve the status of \"famous mark\" under the anti-dilution statute.  The acquisition of secondary meaning merely establishes the minimum threshold necessary for trademark status:  section 43(c) requires a great deal more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3 McCarthy &#167; 24:91;  see also Gilson &#167; 5.12[c][ii] (\"A trademark can certainly be distinctive without being famous, but it cannot be famous without being distinctive.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not understand the district court's conclusion about fame, despite some ambiguity, to have rested solely on its conclusion that the VOLA faucet was distinctive (because it had acquired secondary meaning);  any such per se analysis would be erroneous.  But it appears that the district court did not apply the more rigorous definition of fame under the FTDA.  While one can posit a case having very strong facts which support a distinctiveness finding based on secondary meaning and then using those facts to support the separate, more rigorous analysis of fame, the facts in this case do not have such strength.  Lund has a difficult case to establish fame through the product design of the VOLA faucet, and this record is not strong.  There has been no use by Kohler of the VOLA name, or any other name by which the faucet is known.  Kohler's use, if any, is of a like product design.  There is little to suggest that this product design, itself unregistered and not inherently distinctive, is so strong a mark and so well publicized and known that it has achieved the level of fame Congress intended under the Act.  Consumer surveys could be used as evidence of such fame, but consumer surveys are absent from this case.  Additionally, although some marks, such as COCA-COLA, may be so famous as to be judicially noticed, see Gilson &#167; 5.12[c][iii], the VOLA faucet is far from being a candidate for such judicial notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, national renown<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> is an important factor in determining whether a mark qualifies as famous under the FTDA.  Although the district court found that \"in the world of interior design and high-end bathroom fixtures, the VOLA is renowned,\" Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 126, and that the faucet has been featured and advertised in national magazines and displayed in museums, whether the VOLA's identifying design is sufficiently famous to qualify for the FTDA's protection is far from clear.  In light of the rigorous standard for fame, we find that Lund has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Dilution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the FTDA, even if a mark is famous there is no relief unless that mark has been diluted.  As the district court noted, there are two types of dilution recognized:  blurring and tarnishing.  This case involves no claim of tarnishing, an area in which Congress expressed a strong interest.  Further, in light of the finding of no customer confusion, only a particular type of blurring may be involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intellectual origins of the dilution doctrine are traced to a 1927 Harvard Law Review article, which urged protection against \"the gradual whittling away or dispersion of the identity and hold upon the public mind of the mark or name by its use upon non-competing goods.\"   Schecter, The Rational Basis of Trademark Protection, 40 Harv.  L.Rev. 813, 825 (1927).  Although the origins of the doctrine are concerned with non-competing goods, Congress used language in the FTDA which extends dilution protection even to competing goods.  \"Dilution\" is defined as \"the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish good or services.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1127;  see also H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N at 1030 (stating that dilution \"applies when the unauthorized use of a famous mark reduces the public's perception that the mark signifies something unique, singular, or particular\");  3 McCarthy &#167; 24:93 (\"The crux is whether this particular challenged use lessens the capacity of the famous mark to carry out its role as a trademark--namely, to identify and distinguish.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case differs in several respects from usual dilution cases.  First, unlike most claims of dilution by tarnishment or blurring, the aspect of its product that Lund seeks to protect--the design of the VOLA faucet--likely could have been protected by a design patent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  The possibility of obtaining a design patent is not dispositive of the availability of trade dress protection:  more than one form of intellectual property protection may simultaneously protect particular product features.  Moreover, design patent protection would not have provided protection identical to that sought here.  Nevertheless, the availability of design patent protection does suggest that the claim in this case differs fundamentally from the claims the drafters of the FTDA had in mind--cases where dilution protection is the only form of protection available for a famous mark threatened by unauthorized use of the mark that lessens the mark's capacity to identify its source.  Congress's intent to provide protection where none previously existed is evidenced by the House Report's statement that \"[a] federal dilution statute is necessary because famous marks ordinarily are used on a nationwide basis and dilution protection is currently only available on a patch-quilt system of protection, in that only approximately 25 states have laws that prohibit trademark dilution.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1030.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Lund is seeking protection against a direct competitor.  Although the FTDA states that dilution protection is available against unauthorized use of a famous mark that lessens the mark's ability \"to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of the presence or absence of ... competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties,\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1127 (emphasis added), dilution protection has most often been extended to non-competing uses of a mark, see, e.g., H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1030 (giving examples of \"DUPONT shoes, BUICK aspirin, and KODAK pianos\");  3 McCarthy &#167; 24.72 (noting \"split of authority under ... state statutes as to whether the anti-dilution rule is applicable where the parties are in competition\").  The FTDA recognizes the possibility that dilution may occur in some circumstances where, although some consumers are not confused as to the products' sources, a competitor's use of a mark tarnishes or blurs a senior mark.  Nevertheless, such cases are likely to be exceptions to the more common cases of dilution by non-competing marks.  Dilution laws are intended to address specific harms;  they are not intended to serve as mere fallback protection for trademark owners unable to prove trademark infringement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there may be a tendency to think of dilution in terms of confusion, Congress made it clear that dilution can occur even in the absence of confusion.  It is simple to see why that should be so when non-competing goods are at issue.  No one would confuse Kodak pianos with Kodak film, but the use of the name on the piano could dilute its effectiveness as a mark for the film.  But Congress did not say that there can be dilution without confusion only among non-competing goods.  As the district court aptly noted, the analysis becomes complicated when the concept of blurring is applied to competing similar products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal first with the approach taken by the district court, an approach which had support in precedent.  The district court articulated the standard for determining blurring as follows:  \"Lund must demonstrate that 'the use of a junior mark has caused a lessening of demand for the product or services bearing the famous mark.' \"  Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 126 (quoting Ringling Bros.-Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. Utah Div. of Travel Dev., 955 F.Supp. 605, 616 (E.D.Va.1997)).  This, we think, is not the correct standard.  As Kohler observes, demand for one product is almost always lessened whenever a competing product achieves a measurable degree of success.  Further, blurring has to do with the identification of a product and that is not the same thing as a lessening of demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the dilution claim, the district court used the \"Sweet factors,\" named after the six factors set forth in Judge Sweet's concurrence in Mead Data Central, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., 875 F.2d 1026, 1035 (2d Cir.1989) (Sweet, J., concurring), which involved a claim brought under a New York dilution statute.  Some district courts have used these factors to examine whether dilution exists under the FTDA.  See, e.g., Ringling Bros.-Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. B.E. Windows Corp., 937 F.Supp. 204, 211-14 (S.D.N.Y.1996);  WAWA Dairy Farms v. Haaf, 40 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1629, 1632-33 (E.D.Pa. Aug.7, 1996), aff'd, 116 F.3d 471 (3d Cir.1997);  Clinique Laboratories, Inc. v. Dep Corp., 945 F.Supp. 547, 562 (S.D.N.Y.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler argues that Judge Sweet's six-factor test is inappropriate in determining whether dilution has occurred for purposes of the FTDA.  We agree.  The Sweet factors have been criticized by both courts and commentators for introducing factors that \"are the offspring of classical likelihood of confusion analysis and are not particularly relevant or helpful in resolving the issues of dilution by blurring.\"  3 McCarthy &#167; 24:94.1.  The six Sweet factors are:  \"(1) similarity of the marks (2) similarity of the products covered by the marks (3) sophistication of consumers (4) predatory intent (5) renown of the senior mark [and] (6) renown of the junior mark.\"  Mead Data, 875 F.2d at 1035 (Sweet, J., concurring).  McCarthy urges that only the first and fifth of Judge Sweet's factors--the similarity of the marks and the renown of the senior mark--are relevant to determining whether dilution has occurred.  See 3 McCarthy &#167; 24:94.1;  see also Hershey Foods Corp. v. Mars, Inc., 998 F.Supp. 500, 520 (M.D.Pa.1998) (stating that \"whether the products are similar or not adds nothing to the analysis\" because \"dilution can apply to competitors\");  Klieger, Trademark Dilution:  The Whittling Away of the Rational Basis for Trademark Protection, 58 U. Pitt.  L.Rev. 789, 826-27 (1997) (noting that \"few of these factors bear any relation to whether a particular junior use will debilitate the selling power of a mark\" and that \"[s]o long as a mark qualifies for dilution protection and the senior and junior uses of the mark are not so unrelated as to foreclose the possibility of a mental connection, blurring ... is a foregone conclusion\").  These criticisms are well taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's finding of likelihood of dilution by blurring depended on its use of inappropriate Sweet factors.  As McCarthy points out, use of factors such as predatory intent, similarity of products, sophistication of customers, and renown of the junior mark work directly contrary to the intent of a law whose primary purpose was to apply in cases of widely differing goods, i.e. Kodak pianos and Kodak film.  See 3 McCarthy &#167; 24:94.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are difficulties with the Sweet factors even when used with competing goods.  Blurring occurs in the minds of potential customers.  Predatory intent tells little about how customers in fact perceive products.  That customers are sophisticated may well mean less likelihood of blurring.  That customers knowingly choose to pay less to get a similar product, and trade lower price against having a product of greater fame, does not, contrary to Lund's argument, establish blurring.  Indeed, the district court's findings, in the infringement context, of dissimilarity and sophistication of the customers tend to cut against any finding of blurring.  \"The familiar test of similarity used in the traditional likelihood of confusion test cannot be the guide [for dilution analysis], for likelihood of confusion is not the test of dilution.\"  Id. &#167; 24:90.1.  Instead, the inquiry is into whether target customers are likely to view the products \"as essentially the same.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a more fundamental problem here in attempting to apply the dilution analysis to the design itself of the competing product involved.  We doubt that Congress intended the reach of the dilution concept under the FTDA to extend this far and our doubts are heightened by the presence of constitutional constraints.  Where words are the marks at issue it is easy to understand that there can be blurring and tarnishment when there is a completely different product to which the words are applied.  The congressional history described earlier gives such examples.  What is much more difficult is to see how dilution is to be shown where some of a design is partially replicated and the result is largely dissimilar and does not create consumer confusion.  If that is so, as is true here, then it is difficult to see that there has been dilution of the source signaling function of the design (even assuming that such a function has been established through secondary meaning).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, it appears that an entirely different issue is at stake--not interference with the source signaling function but rather protection from an appropriation of or free riding on the investment Lund has made in its design.  That investment is usually given protection by patents, which have a limited duration.  See W.T. Rogers Co., 778 F.2d at 348.   But again, that free riding or appropriation appears to be of the beauty of the object and not of the source, and may in fact be good for consumers.  As the district court observed, these sophisticated buyers know a different source is involved and are, accordingly, most likely purchasing because of the aesthetics.  And even if there is some appropriation or free riding, the extent of it here is not clear.  Certainly it is not plausible to think that Congress intended to protect aesthetic characteristics by simply assuming harm or damages based on the fact that the plaintiff will sell less if the defendant sells more.  What is clear is that the interests here are not the interests at the core of what Congress intended to protect in the FTDA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible that Congress did not really envision protection for product design from dilution by a competing product under the FTDA, but the language it used does not permit us to exclude such protection categorically and rare cases can be imagined.  But a broad reading of dilution would bring us close to the constitutional edge, and we decline to attribute such brinksmanship to Congress, and so insist on rigorous review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the interpretation of the fame and dilution requirements for the FTDA set forth today, the requirements for granting the preliminary injunction have not been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. Constitutionality of the FTDA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler argues that the FTDA may never constitutionally be applied to enjoin a competitor in a product design trade dress case.  Kohler's constitutional challenge involves two steps.  First, Kohler argues that applying the FTDA to product designs grants patent-like protections for an unlimited period of time.  Second, Kohler argues that Congress's Commerce Clause power--the basis of Congress's regulation of trademarks and trade dress--cannot be used to trump the Patent Clause.  Lund responds that federal anti-dilution legislation is fully consistent with Congress's Commerce Clause power, and that patent and trademark laws protect different interests and serve different goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly noted that Kohler faced a \"very high preliminary injunction standard on their [constitutional] claim,\" and that the statute was \"presumptively constitutional.\"  Lund II, 11 F.Supp.2d at 134. The court concluded that defendant Kohler was unlikely to succeed with its argument that the FTDA is unconstitutional in all product design contexts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler's constitutional attack on application of the FTDA here is mooted by our resolution of the injunction issue.  To the extent Kohler is mounting something akin to a facial attack, we think it better not to address constitutional issues in the abstract.  The resolution of any conflict between the Patent Clause and the FTDA is better handled on specific facts which present the issues with clarity, and not on the basis of theoretical impacts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VIII. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the parties and the district court labored through this case without the benefit of binding precedent on a number of key and difficult issues, particularly the interpretation of the FTDA.  The denial of the preliminary injunction on the infringement claim is affirmed.  The grant of the injunction on the FTDA claim is vacated inasmuch as there were no findings on functionality and standards for determining both fame and dilution under the FTDA were used which are different from those announced today and the evidence does not show probability of success under those standards.  The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

A central limitation on patent and copyright protection, stemming from the Constitution itself, is that it is limited in time.  See U.S. Const. art.  I, &#167; 8, cl. 8;  35 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 101, 154 (20-year utility patent);  35 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 171, 173 (14-year design patent);  17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 302-304 (various limited-time copyrights).  After the period of protection expires, copying by others is allowed.  This case presents, in addition to other problems, the threat that the permanent injunction sought may prevent the Lund faucet from being duplicated forever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In substance, Lund created a faucet configuration called VOLA that involves a downward curving water pipe protruding from a wall (rather than the sink itself) and a similarly protruding control rod to regulate both water flow and temperature (instead of the usual pair of spigots).  The concept of a wall-based mechanism, and the size and shape and relative proportions of the pipe and control rod, are pleasing to customers.  The resulting VOLA faucet configuration is successful and recognized in the trade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund has now obtained a preliminary injunction against Kohler forbidding Kohler from selling Kohler's own faucet system that embodies the same concept and a similar but not identically shaped pipe and control rod.  What Lund regards as the scope of its \"monopoly\" is not entirely clear:  all we know is that this Kohler faucet system has been enjoined.  What will be assumed, or else the legal problems would be even greater than they are, is that the concept of a water pipe and control rod protruding from a wall is not sought to be prohibited but only one whose shape and size are similar to VOLA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  Even so, a serious problem exists because the assumed protection (if the preliminary injunction matures into a permanent one) could be perpetual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund says that this perpetual protection of its design is permitted because its source is not a design patent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>--Lund has not sought one--but rather the trademark laws.  Trademarks are ordinarily conceived as names (e.g., Kodak) or marks (the AT &amp; T striped circle logo), but trademarks also include so-called \"trade dress,\" see 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1127;  and this in turn includes the ornamental design of an article where the design performs the traditional \"source signaling\" function of trademarks.  Usually, this is achieved by the \"wrapping\" (e.g., the classic Coca Cola bottle) or some ornament affixed to the product (the star symbol on the Mercedes hood);  but the design of the product itself can sometimes qualify.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A permanent restriction on copying the design of a product might still seem offensive to patent and copyright policy, but at least this protection can be explained where the replication would otherwise confuse buyers as to source, traditionally the concern of trademark protection.  The difficulty in this case arises because Congress has removed the requirement of confusion for protection of \"famous\" trademarks and said that, in the alternative, they will be protected against \"dilution\" even where no confusion exists as to source.  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c).  Congress was worried that even without customer confusion as to source a famous trade name or mark, like \"Kodak,\" could be blurred or degraded by being attached by others to their own products (e.g., sports clothing, dog food).  See 141 Cong. Rec.  S19306, S19310 (daily ed.  Dec. 29, 1995) (statement of Sen.  Hatch).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast to a trademark consisting of a name or insignia, a product design will not often qualify as a trademark inviting protection from dilution.  A trade name or device usually identifies source, but the design of the product itself in most cases makes the product more efficient, attractive, or both.  If more efficient, trademark protection is foreclosed altogether under the \"functionality\" doctrine, see Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 164, 115 S.Ct. 1300;  Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 775, 112 S.Ct. 2753;  and if attractiveness is the primary function, the product design does not normally qualify as a candidate to achieve secondary meaning and thus trademark status.  See Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U.S. 844, 851 n. 11, 102 S.Ct. 2182, 72 L.Ed.2d 606 (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But conceivably in some rare case a product design might have source signaling as its main function (perhaps the old 1950's Cadillac tail fin might be an instance) and be copied by a competitor (say, for Volkswagen Beetles) without any risk of customer confusion.  At that point, if the new trademark statute is taken literally, Cadillac might then claim a permanent monopoly on its tail fin design, subject only to a showing that Volkswagen's use threatened to \"dilute\" the strength of that tail fin as a Cadillac trademark.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c).  One may wonder whether Congress ever contemplated such a result, but the statute's language arguably permits it or at least does not explicitly foreclose the possibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If so, much turns on how dilution is defined and proved.  The federal statute is recent, but state laws have protected against dilution for some time, and under those statutes there is some tendency to assume that dilution is threatened wherever the famous trademark is copied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>  After all, the concern is with the long-term \"whittling away\" of the strength of the mark by other unauthorized uses, see L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., 811 F.2d 26, 30 (1st Cir.1987), and, absent confusion, there may be no immediate damage from any single use.  Where only a word or symbol is forever preempted, this protective approach toward the trademark may make sense, and in all events does not pose much risk to the policies of the patent and copyright clauses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation is quite different where design of an article is given permanent protection without any threat of confusion.  If buyers prefer articles of that design, then the public pays a price whenever the design cannot eventually be used by other manufacturers.  In the case of patents and copyrights, the foreclosure of competition is deemed a price worth paying for a limited time--in order to induce such creations--but only for a limited time.  Is this policy of time-limited protection, constitutional at its core, overcome wherever dilution is threatened--even though no confusion can be proved and any impairment of the trademark may be only potential and directed primarily to protecting the seller rather than the public?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might point to the possible diversion of sales from Lund to Kohler as practical harm in this very case.  Yet such diversion does not prove either confusion or dilution:  a copied product can easily take sales from the original manufacturer if the copied product is better made or sold at a lower price or the design is slightly better--outcomes generally beneficial to the public.  Giving weight to diversion of sales, in the absence of confusion of customers, simply underscores that the protection is generally similar to that afforded for patented articles--save that the protection here may be unlimited in time.  Giving patent-like protection a new name does not avoid constitutional limitations.  Cf. Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., 489 U.S. 141, 146, 109 S.Ct. 971, 103 L.Ed.2d 118 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The traditional interest in trademark protection is stretched very thin in dilution cases where confusion is absent and a professed aim is to protect the maker's investment in the trademark.  See H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1030.   And the threat to the public interest, ordinarily countered by the time limit on patent protection, is acute where a permanent protection is offered not to a word or symbol but to the design of an article of manufacture.  In such an instance, it is a difficult constitutional question whether protecting the investment can outweigh the public interest in replication, a question best deferred unless and until all other preconditions for protection are resolved in favor and decision on this last issue is absolutely necessary.

Hernandez Colon, 963 F.2d 488, 494 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Kohler refers to the VOLA faucet as the \"111C faucet.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> \"Hole\" in this context refers to where the spout and handles fit and not to the drain</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Lund also raised common law unfair competition and Massachusetts state law claims.

The VOLA faucet mounts on a wall, has been in the design collection at the Museum of Modern Art, and has a certain cachet among those who enjoy bathrooms and kitchens beautiful.  Kohler intended to produce a faucet like Lund's, but not identical to it, and hence designed the now-enjoined Falling Water faucet.  There were two basic claims before the trial court:  that the Falling Water faucet \"diluted\" the VOLA faucet's trade dress within the meaning of the Federal Trademark Dilution Act of 1995 (\"FTDA\"), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c), and that the Falling Water faucet infringed the VOLA's trade dress.  Lund won a preliminary injunction on the first ground, but not on the second.  See I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2288865\"><a href=\"/opinion/2288865/ip-lund-trading-aps-v-kohler-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

The district court found, as to the infringement claim, that while the VOLA faucet was not inherently distinctive, it had acquired secondary meaning and thus was protectable, but that there was no infringement because there was no confusion on the part of consumers.  In contrast, under the FTDA, where no confusion need be shown, the court found the VOLA faucet was famous and that Kohler's faucet diluted the identity of the VOLA faucet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case presents complex issues arising in areas of intellectual property law recently extended and not yet well demarcated.  Few courts of appeals have yet interpreted the FTDA and this court has never addressed certain key issues, under both the infringement and FTDA claims, necessary to the resolution of the case.  The district court wrote thoughtfully, and, particularly as to the FTDA issues, without much appellate guidance.  The claim for protection here comes not from traditional marks such as names but from the very design of the faucet itself--that design is said to give the faucet its identity and distinctiveness.  Although Lund may have been able to obtain a design patent and so protect its VOLA faucet in that way, at least for a period of fourteen years, see 35 U.S.C. &#167; 173, it chose not to.  Rather, it chose to turn for protection to legal doctrines of trademark and trade dress, originally crafted without product designs in mind.  The trade dress of product designs, unlike other forms of trade dress, cannot be separated from the product itself.  Kohler has raised serious constitutional concerns, saying that this use of the FTDA against a competing product essentially gives a perpetual monopoly to product design, a perpetual monopoly prohibited by the Patent Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler and Robern (collectively \"Kohler\") argue that the district court erred in its determination that plaintiffs I.P. Lund Trading ApS and Kroin Incorporated (collectively \"Lund\") demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim under the FTDA that the Falling Water faucet dilutes the trade dress of Lund's VOLA faucet.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Lund cross-appeals, arguing that the district court erred in determining that Lund was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its infringement claim.  We affirm the denial of the preliminary injunction on the infringement claim.  We vacate the grant of the injunction on the FTDA claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several questions of first impression are resolved in this opinion.  We hold that the burden of showing non-functionality of a product for which trade dress protection is sought rests on the party seeking that protection.  Here that is the plaintiff Lund.  In analyzing inherent distinctiveness in the context of product design, we hold that while the well-known Abercrombie test provides a useful analogy, strict application of the test is not required;  we reiterate this court's adherence to the Seabrook Foods test.  We emphasize that, in any case where the trade dress is said to arise from the product design, there must be separate analyses as to (1) whether a design is inherently distinctive and (2) whether it has nonetheless acquired distinctiveness through secondary meaning.  As to secondary meaning said to stem from the design of the product itself, we hold that the plaintiff must show that the primary significance of the design is to signify its source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the FTDA, we hold that a party who wishes to establish fame of the trade dress for which protection is sought bears a significantly greater burden than the burden of establishing distinctiveness for infringement purposes.  The FTDA creates an exceptional anti-dilution remedy for truly famous marks.  Once this greater burden of establishing fame has been met under the FTDA, the issue of dilution must be addressed.  We reject the use of the \"Sweet factors\" as the test for dilution and instead require an inquiry into whether target customers will perceive the products as essentially the same.

Facts and Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund, a Danish corporation, manufactures bathroom and kitchen fixtures and accessories, including faucets.  Lund has been a family-owned corporation since its establishment in 1873.  In 1969, Lund introduced the VOLA faucet, designed by the noted architect Arne Jacobsen.  The faucet, which has received numerous awards over the past quarter-century, is Lund's principal revenue-producing product.  Lund has sold a total of more than 600,000 VOLA faucets.  The faucet has been regularly advertised and featured in numerous magazines.  Kroin Incorporated is the sole United States distributor of the VOLA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler is the largest supplier of plumbing fixtures in this country, selling hundreds of types of kitchen and bathroom fixtures.  In 1994, Kohler contacted Lund regarding the possibility of selling the VOLA faucet under Kohler's name.  In 1995, Kohler purchased eight VOLA faucets from Lund for the purpose of testing the faucets to see if they fit in a sink that Kohler planned to introduce and to ensure that the faucets complied with United States regulations.  Kohler claims that it tested the faucets and found that they did not meet U.S. regulations regarding water flow capacity and resistance to hydrostatic pressure, a contention Lund contests, and as to which there was conflicting evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler gave a VOLA faucet to Erich Slothower, an industrial designer employed by Kohler.  Slothower then designed the Falling Water faucet, which Kohler introduced for sale at a price lower than that of the VOLA faucet.  Slothower testified that he examined the VOLA carefully prior to designing the Falling Water, but that he attempted to make the Falling Water faucet different from the VOLA.  Kohler's large size and well-established distribution channels mean that the Falling Water is likely to be more easily available, in addition to being less expensive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found a number of similarities between the VOLA and the Falling Water faucets.  Both are \"single-control, wall-mounted faucets\" with handles that \"utilize a thin cylindrical lever to adjust water temperature and volume\";  both have \"spouts and aerator holders ... of uniform diameter,\" with the spouts \"bend[ing] downward at right angles softened by a curve\";  and \"both faucets offer spouts in almost exactly the same three lengths.\"  Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 116.   Both faucets fit no-hole sinks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In contrast, most sinks sold in the United States are \"three-hole\" sinks, with one hole each for the water spout and the hot and cold spigots.  However, the district court also found dissimilarities between the faucets, including differences in the faucets' handles, a rounded lever on the Falling Water faucet compared to a flat lever on the VOLA, and a rounded bonnet--a piece that connects the faucet to the wall--on the mounting end of the Falling Water spout, compared to no bonnet on the VOLA.  See id.   The court also found that the housemarks, \"VOLA\" and \"Kohler,\" are clearly dissimilar and are prominently displayed on the faucets.  See id. at 123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Co-defendant Robern, which Kohler acquired in August 1995, also purchased a number of VOLA faucets.  Before being acquired by Kohler, Robern purchased 218 VOLA faucets from Kroin for use in a sink module.  Robern apparently promoted its sink module pictured with the VOLA faucets.  At approximately the same time as Kohler acquired Robern, Kroin refused to sell additional VOLA faucets to Robern, claiming that Robern was selling the faucets to Kroin's customers at prices below those Kroin was charging.  One year later, Robern announced plans to market its sink module with the Falling Water faucet.  Lund produced evidence that Robern has continued to use pictures of the VOLA in promotional materials, despite the fact that it has replaced the VOLA with the Falling Water faucet in its sink modules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler introduced the Falling Water faucet to the market in 1996.  Lund filed suit on February 27, 1997, alleging trade dress infringement under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act and trade dress dilution under the FTDA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Kohler denied any violations and argued that the FTDA was unconstitutional as applied to product designs.

In a February 5, 1998 Memorandum and Order, the court found that Lund had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on its dilution claim, and so enjoined Kohler from selling its Falling Water faucet.  See Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 127.   At the same time, the court found that Lund had failed to show likelihood of success on its claim of trade dress infringement, and it reserved decision on the question of the constitutionality of the FTDA pending additional briefing.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 12, 1998, the district court stayed the preliminary injunction pending resolution of Kohler's claim that application of the FTDA to product designs violates the Patent Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an order dated March 31, 1998 and a memorandum dated April 2, 1998, the district court found that Kohler's constitutional argument was unlikely to succeed on the merits, lifted the stay on the injunction, and ordered Lund to post a bond of $250,000.

Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act provides protection against the use of \"any word, term, name, symbol, or device\" that \"is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\" as to the source of a product.  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(a).

The new law, the FTDA, Lanham Act section 43(c), grants protection to \"famous\" marks against any use of the mark that \"causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To resolve the issues presented, we go back to the underlying purposes of trademark and trade dress infringement and dilution protections.  The various intellectual property protection mechanisms serve related but distinct ends.  These distinct ends inform the selection of appropriate tests under the different sections of the Lanham Act.  These distinctions are also particularly pertinent to Kohler's constitutional claim that dilution protection of trade dress of product design amounts to an unconstitutional perpetual monopoly under the Patent Clause of the Constitution.  The Patent Clause itself describes the \"exclusive Right\" given as being for \"limited Times.\"   U.S. Const. art.  I, &#167; 8, cl. 8.  \"The laws of patents, copyright, trade secrets, trademarks, unfair competition, and misappropriation balance the conflicting interests in protection and dissemination differently in different contexts through specific rules that determine just who will receive protection, of just what kind, under what circumstances, and for how long.\"  DeCosta v.

Any protection of the public intended by the FTDA is indirect at best.  \"Anti-dilution statutes have developed to fill a void left by the failure of trademark infringement law to curb the unauthorized use of marks where there is no likelihood of confusion between the original use and the infringing use.\"  L.L.

Those elements are that marks (a) must be used in commerce, (b) must be non-functional, and (c) must be distinctive.

See generally 1 McCarthy &#167; 7:72.  The Lanham Act itself provides no guidance on the issue, and the caselaw contains little discussion of the rationale for allocating the burden of proof to plaintiffs or defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the party alleging trademark infringement and dilution bears the burden of proving non-functionality of those elements of the physical object that the plaintiff claims constitute the mark and for which the plaintiff is seeking protection.  Several rationales support the burden being placed on those seeking protection, here the plaintiff.  Functionality, or, more precisely, a showing of non-functionality of the elements for which protection is sought, is an essential component of the protection the law gives to trademarks and trade dress.  A showing of non-functionality is essential because the doctrine prevents trademarks from limiting legitimate competition.  Put differently, \"functionality\" plays an important role in preventing a constitutional problem between the Lanham Act and patent law.  Moreover, Congress did not intend to provide Lanham Act protection to functional aspects of products, see Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 775, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2753</span></a></span>, and thus it would be anomalous if the burden were not placed on the party seeking protection.  Such an assignment of the burden of proof ensures that trademarks serve their intended purpose of identifying product sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff's product is known best by plaintiff itself.  A contrary result, placing the burden on defendant, could lead to untoward results.  It could also lead to unwarranted litigation.  If protected elements of a product are indeed functional, and the burden of showing non-functionality is placed on plaintiff, plaintiff will have incentives not to bring unwarranted actions hoping that defendants will fail to raise or prove functionality as an affirmative defense.  It would be far easier for plaintiffs to obtain protection for functional aspects of their products--and thus limit legitimate competition--if defendants were to bear the burden of proof, as defendants might lack the ability or incentive to pursue the issue fully.  There is value in minimizing the chances of the issue not being properly raised or presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Application of Functionality Doctrine</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not make a specific finding on functionality and the record on the important issue of functionality is unclear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Although Lund I commented that \"[n]o one argues that the VOLA design is 'functional,' as that term is used in trademark law,\" Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 120 n. 12, Kohler did in fact argue in a filing that \"to the extent that some features on the respective faucets may somewhat resemble each other, these features are either functional in nature and thus not protectable under the Lanham Act or so commonly used in the plumbing industry that they are obvious--not distinctive of a particular product\" (emphasis added).  Thus Kohler did not waive the issue.  We cannot say that it is obvious no aspect of the VOLA is functional;  indeed some aspects give the appearance of being functional and so the issue is a real one.  There are significant dissimilarities between the two faucets, and at least some of the similarities that do exist are suggestive of functionality.  Nonetheless, we will assume at this stage of the case that there is some non-functional residuum based on the aesthetic unity and proportions of the VOLA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue of functionality plays a key role in this case.  In the absence of a finding of non-functionality of the aspects of the VOLA for which protection is sought, and in light of our placing the burden of proof on plaintiff, there can be no trademark or trade dress protection.  If the VOLA design or aspects of it are functional, then the only source of exclusive rights would be in a utility patent.  Trademark and trade dress law cannot be used to evade the requirements of utility patents, nor the limits on monopolies imposed by the Patent Clause.  This also means that in the absence of a finding of non-functionality, no protection is available under the FTDA and no injunction may issue under the FTDA, a point to which we return later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But there is another reason that the functionality analysis must be undertaken.  There is a relationship between functionality and distinctiveness:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>If a feature is functional, it is likely that all similar articles will have a similar functional feature, and one seller's feature is not likely to evoke any response in buyers that it is unique or is a distinctive symbol of origin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1 McCarthy &#167; 7:64.  It is also clear that even if a functional feature has achieved secondary meaning as an indication of origin, that feature is not protectable under trademark or trade dress law.  See Fisher Stoves, 626 F.2d at 195-96;  1 McCarthy &#167; 7:66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Distinctiveness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third prerequisite for protection is distinctiveness.  In order to receive trade dress protection, a product must either be inherently distinctive or have acquired secondary meaning.  See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2753</span></a></span>;  TEC Eng'g Corp., 82 F.3d at 545.   The inquiry into distinctiveness turns on the total appearance of the product, not on individual elements.  Cf. Sunbeam, 123 F.3d at 251 (stating that \" 'trade dress' refers to the total image and overall appearance of a product\").  The district court found, within the usual preliminary injunction standards about likelihood of success, that the VOLA faucet was not inherently distinctive but that it had acquired secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1.

Suggestive, arbitrary, and fanciful marks are deemed inherently distinctive;  descriptive marks receive protection only upon a showing that they have acquired secondary meaning;  and generic marks are not protectable.  Abercrombie itself addressed words, the usual form of mark.  The Abercrombie test has been used in some other areas of trade dress, such as product packaging and the overall appearance of a restaurant.  See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768-69, 773, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the Supreme Court in Two Pesos endorsed the Abercrombie test in the context of non-verbal trade dress not involving product designs, at least two circuits have been skeptical of the appropriateness of the test in the product design context.  See Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709490\"><a href=\"/opinion/709490/knitwaves-inc-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-lollytogs-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span>, 1007-08 (2d Cir.1995);  Duraco Prods., Inc. v.

Indeed, these courts, questioning whether a product design can ever be inherently distinctive, apply a more rigorous standard for determining inherent distinctiveness of product designs than they do for determining the inherent distinctiveness of more traditional forms of trade dress.  See Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1008-09 (requiring that a product design serve primarily to indicate a product's source);  Duraco Prods., 40 F.3d at 1449 (requiring product designs to be \"(i) unusual and memorable;  (ii) conceptually separable from the product;  and (iii) likely to serve primarily as a designator of origin of the product\").  The problem with applying traditional trademark or trade dress classifications to product designs arises because \"one cannot automatically conclude from a product feature or configuration--as one can from a product's arbitrary name ...--that, to a consumer, it functions primarily to denote the product's source.\"  Duraco Prods., 40 F.3d at 1441.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Parting from the skeptics, the Eighth Circuit has rejected any differentiation between product designs and other forms of trade dress.  See Stuart Hall Co. v. Ampad Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"693018\"><a href=\"/opinion/693018/stuart-hall-company-inc-a-missouri-corporation-v-ampad-corp-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span>, 787-88 (8th Cir.1995).  The Stuart Hall court argued that the Second and Third Circuit tests would effectively eliminate the possibility that a product design could be inherently distinctive, collapsing the inherent distinctiveness inquiry into the secondary meaning inquiry.  See id. at 787 (\"The requirement of source-identification applies not to whether a trade dress is inherently distinctive, but to whether it has a secondary meaning.\").  Such an outcome would directly contradict the Supreme Court's holding in Two Pesos that inherently distinctive trade dress is protectable even absent a showing of secondary meaning.  See id. at 788 (citing Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769-70, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Like the court in Knitwaves, the district court did so by looking to whether the VOLA's creators intended the design to serve as a source indicator.  See id.;   see also Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1009 (\"As Knitwaves' objective in the two sweater designs was primarily aesthetic, the designs were not primarily intended as source identification.  Those sweater designs therefore fail to qualify for protection of trade dress inherent in product design.\").  The court found that the VOLA's design was \"not 'primarily' intended as source identification\" because \"Lund's design objective was 'primarily aesthetic,' \" and thus \"the design of the VOLA faucet cannot be considered inherently distinctive.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund argues that the district court was in error because it was obligated by Supreme Court precedent to apply the Abercrombie test.

The Supreme Court stated only that \"[m]arks are often classified in\" the five Abercrombie categories.  Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2753</span></a></span>.   The Court did not mandate the application of the Abercrombie test;  rather, it affirmed the use of the Abercrombie factors in the case before it.  See id. at 768-69, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The holding of Two Pesos was that plaintiffs seeking protection for inherently distinctive trade dress are not required to demonstrate secondary meaning.  See id. at 770, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112783\"><a href=\"/opinion/112783/two-pesos-inc-v-taco-cabana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2753</span></a></span>.   Unless the Court decides to carve out an exception to this rule for claims about product design, which we deem unlikely, then the holding must be honored.  And so we agree with the Eighth Circuit that the test for inherent distinctiveness should not be altered to the degree that it eviscerates the distinction between inherently distinctive trade dress and trade dress that has acquired secondary meaning.  We do not believe, however, that analysis of the problem using different factors than the Abercrombie factors results in such an outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has previously relied on the test set forth in Seabrook Foods, Inc. v.

We also agree with one commentator's analysis that \"[i]n reality, all three [Seabrook Foods ] questions are merely different ways to ask whether the design, shape or combination of elements is so unique, unusual or unexpected in this market that one can assume without proof that it will automatically be perceived by customers as an indicator of origin--a trademark.\"  1 McCarthy &#167; 8:13.  Although the plaintiff in Wiley brought suit under state common law, we find the test equally applicable to claims brought under the Lanham Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Seabrook Foods test is largely consistent with the Second Circuit's Knitwaves test for inherent distinctiveness, that is, whether the design \"is likely to serve primarily as a designator of origin of the product.\"  Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1008 (quoting Duraco Prods., 40 F.3d at 1449) (internal quotation marks omitted);  see also Landscape Forms, Inc. v.

Cf. Knitwaves, 71 F.3d at 1008.   Although plaintiffs seeking to demonstrate that a product design is inherently distinctive may find that their task is a difficult one, Two Pesos makes clear that this opportunity remains open.  Product designs are unlike many more traditional subjects of trademark protection, \"which almost automatically tell a customer that they refer to a brand,\" Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 162-63, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117913\"><a href=\"/opinion/117913/qualitex-co-v-jacobson-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1300</span></a></span>, and it is therefore unlikely that many product designs will be found to be inherently distinctive.  Nevertheless, plaintiffs seeking trade dress protection for product designs are entitled to attempt to show that their designs are so unique as to be primarily perceived as indicating the product's origin.  Cf. 2 McCarthy &#167; 15:9 (\"A design or shape, or a trade dress that is so fanciful as to be inherently distinctive can function as a mark without the need for proof of secondary meaning.  The issue is whether this shape is so different or unusual for this type of goods or services that its distinctiveness can be assumed.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying Knitwaves, the district court did make a finding as to inherent distinctiveness.  It found that the VOLA's design is not \"likely to serve primarily as a designator of origin of the product.\"   On this record that finding cannot be said to be clearly erroneous.  One aspect of the test applied in reaching this conclusion is, nonetheless, problematic.  The district court relied on evidence as to Lund's intent.  But the plaintiff's intent is not entitled to much weight in a determination of whether a product design is inherently distinctive.  See 1 McCarthy &#167; 8.13 (stating that \"the intent of the designer is a very weak indicator of the likely reaction of potential customers\");  cf.  Landscape Forms, 113 F.3d at 377 n. 3 (\"If Knitwaves forced courts to decide whether a manufacturer's purpose was to create either something of beauty or something indicative of source, we agree the task would often prove impossible.\").

The district court also found that \"[e]nough money and effort has been invested in promoting the VOLA's design that it is recognizable as coming from a unique source, albeit through a variety of distributors,\" and that \"the primary significance of the VOLA design, to the relevant public, is as a high-end product, coming from Lund.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler challenges the district court's determination that the VOLA has most likely acquired secondary meaning.

First, as noted, there was no analysis of functionality and there is a relationship between functionality and secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the context suggests otherwise--the district court found, under separate but related doctrines, that the faucets were mostly dissimilar.  Cf. 2 McCarthy &#167; 15:38 (stating that copying may give rise to an inference of secondary meaning).  The court found that there was no customer confusion.  It is in this barren context that the claim is made that something in the design which is not functional serves primarily to signify the source of the faucet and not primarily to signify that it is an aesthetically pleasing faucet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, little is present of the evidence traditionally relied on (but which admittedly is not a sine qua non) for a finding of secondary meaning.  The secondary meaning analysis is primarily a subjective one, looking into the minds of potential customers.  Customer survey evidence, while not required, is a valuable method of showing secondary meaning.  See Boston Athletic Ass'n v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518087\"><a href=\"/opinion/518087/boston-athletic-association-v-mark-sullivan-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 32 n. 9 (1st Cir.1989);  Colby College, 508 F.2d at 809.   As the district court correctly noted, the purported survey evidence was unreliable.

This situation is akin to the use of different marks to identify a single product.  \"When a product ... design is sold by the authority of plaintiff under several different word marks ..., it is more difficult for plaintiff to prove acquisition of secondary meaning--that is, that the shape or design identifies a single source.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  1 McCarthy &#167; 8:14 (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, while such testimony is entitled to little weight because the focus is on the understanding of prospective purchasers, the testimony is that Lund did not intend in designing the product that the design signify source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the VOLA product has been much advertised or featured, but at times without any source attribution or with attribution to different sources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund relies heavily on the testimony of Corbin, a retailer presented as Lund's expert.  Corbin stated that the VOLA was \"perceived as a high-end product, a very simple and elegant product;  one that is generally known by name as either a Kroin faucet or Jacobsen faucet;  ...  a design icon....\"  But to say it is a design success is not to say that the primary significance of the design is to signify its source.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end we need not resolve the point.

See DeCosta, 981 F.2d at 605.

The factors are non-exclusive, however, and are not always apt to the particular facts of a case.  See Winship Green, 103 F.3d at 201.

The court found that the strength of the VOLA's mark and the similarity of the VOLA and the Falling Water products were factors that favored the plaintiffs, but that the class of prospective purchasers, the channels of trade, the defendant's intent, and the dissimilarity of the VOLA and Falling Water marks all favored the defendants.

Second, Lund argues that the court erred in its determination that the dissimilarity of the marks weighed against a finding of consumer confusion.  Third, Lund argues that the district court erred when it found that Kohler's intention not to copy the VOLA weighed against a finding of consumer confusion.

We have carefully considered each of Lund's arguments, and are unpersuaded that the district court's determination as to the probability of success on each of these points was erroneous.  However, we clarify two matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, little weight should be given to the determination that Kohler did not intend to copy the VOLA.  In Chrysler, this court commented that \"[s]trictly, intent, or lack thereof, does not affect the eyes of the viewer.\"  Chrysler, 118 F.3d at 59 n. 3. We added that \"[p]roof of bad intent may, psychologically, hurt as an admission,\" but \"[p]roof of good intent does not change appearance.\"  Id. Similarly, in Star Financial Services we commented that \"a finding of good faith is no answer if likelihood of confusion is otherwise established.\"  Star Fin.  Servs., 89 F.3d at 11 (quoting Colby College, 508 F.2d at 811-12) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus a finding of no intent to copy may not outweigh other factors that suggest a likelihood of confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the district court's discussion of post-sale confusion was based on an erroneous premise.  In finding that post-sale confusion was unlikely, the court commented that \"there is little or no chance that [the faucets] will be resold to unwary consumers.\"  Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 123.   Post-sale confusion refers not to the resale of the original product, however, but to the risk that non-purchasers, who themselves may be future consumers, will be deceived.  See 3 McCarthy &#167; 23:7 (noting that \"[t]he damage to the senior user ... is that consumers could acquire the prestige value of the senior user's product by buying the copier's cheap imitation,\" and that in such a case, \"[e]ven though the knowledgeable buyer knew that it was getting an imitation, viewers would be confused\").  For example, in a case involving counterfeit Rolex watches, the court commented that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p>[i]ndividuals examining the counterfeits, believing them to be genuine Rolex watches, might find themselves unimpressed with the quality of the item and consequently be inhibited from purchasing the real time piece.  Others who see the watches bearing the Rolex trademarks on so many wrists might find themselves discouraged from acquiring a genuine because the items have become too common place and no longer possess the prestige once associated with them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rolex Watch U.S.A., Inc. v.

In other words, even if the purchaser of a Falling Water faucet knew that she was buying the Kohler faucet and not the VOLA, the district court could still find a likelihood of confusion if subsequent viewers of the faucet would believe it to be a VOLA.  Cf. Keds Corp. v. Renee Int'l Trading Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531209\"><a href=\"/opinion/531209/the-keds-corp-v-renee-international-trading-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that \"point of sale confusion was not the only issue\" because \"prospective consumers, viewing the clothes on other people, would be confused as to the origin of the goods\").  However, because the district court's determination of no likelihood of post-sale confusion does not appear to have been a key factor in its decision, we do not believe it undercuts the court's conclusion regarding probability of success on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly found that Lund was unlikely to prevail on the merits of its infringement claim, and so correctly denied the preliminary injunction on those grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. Dilution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund obtained the preliminary injunction against Kohler's distribution and promotion of the Falling Water faucet based on the district court's finding of likelihood of success under the new federal anti-dilution statute, the FTDA, which became effective in 1996.  The injunction rested on the conclusion that Lund had established a likelihood of success of showing two essential elements.  The first is that the \"mark,\" that is, the VOLA product design as an identifying mark, was \"famous.\"   The second is that Kohler's Falling Water faucet \"diluted\" Lund's mark.  Both the terms \"famous\" and \"dilution\" are terms of art given specific rigorous meanings by the FTDA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the language of the Act.  The FTDA provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p>The owner of a famous mark shall be entitled, subject to the principles of equity and upon such terms as the court deems reasonable, to an injunction against another person's commercial use in commerce of a mark or trade name, if such use begins after the mark has become famous and causes dilution of the distinctive quality of the mark, and to obtain such other relief as is provided in this subsection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FTDA created a new \"federal cause of action to protect famous marks from unauthorized users that attempt to trade upon the goodwill and established renown of such marks and, thereby, dilute their distinctive quality.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N at 1030.   Congress acted against a \"patch-quilt system\" of state law protection in which approximately twenty-five states had laws prohibiting trademark dilution.  Id. While creating a federal cause of action, Congress expressly did not preempt state law, but attempted to create uniformity through the availability of a federal cause of action.  A second consideration--protection of famous marks of U.S. companies abroad--also motivated Congress.  See id. at 4, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N at 1031.   Enactment of the FTDA was consistent with agreements which were part of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (specifically, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, including Trade in Counterfeit Goods (\"TRIPS\")) and the Paris Convention.  Enactment of the law was also thought to be of value to the U.S. in bilateral and multi-lateral trade negotiations.

Thus, for example, the use of DuPont shoes, Buick aspirin, and Kodak pianos would be actionable under this bill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">141 Cong. Rec.  S19306, S19310 (daily ed. Dec. 29, 1995) (statement of Sen.  Hatch).  Thus the archetypal problems involved non-competing products as to which there could, by definition, be no confusion and a world-famous brand name which was either tarnished or blurred by its application to a different product which was obviously trading on the good will of that name.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the FTDA itself is, however, not limited to addressing these archetypal problems.  A few observations are in order.  First, the Act applies to products which are competitors (as is true of the faucets here) as well as to products which are totally dissimilar and are not competitors.  Second, the Act applies to a famous \"mark\" and does not restrict the definition of that term to names or traditional marks.  In the absence of such a restriction, the Act applies to all types of marks recognized by the Lanham Act, including marks derived from product designs.  Kohler's argument that the Act cannot, as a matter of statutory interpretation, be applied to product design is rejected.  Third, the Act applies even where there is no customer confusion, a point with consequences discussed later.  Fourth, the additional protection afforded by the Act requires that a mark go beyond what is required for ordinary Lanham Act protection.  Only those marks which are \"distinctive and famous\" are protected.  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c)(1).  As set forth in the 1987 Trademark Review Commission Report, the precursor of the 1996 Act, this language reflected \"the policy goal that to be protected, a mark had to be truly prominent and renowned.\"  3 McCarthy &#167; 24.91 (citing The United States Trademark Association Trademark Review Commission Report and Recommendations to USTA President and Board of Directors, 77 Trademark Rep. 375, 459-60 (1987)).  With this background, we turn to the district court's two essential conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Fame and Distinctiveness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirements of commercial use, non-functionality, and distinctiveness are common to both the infringement claim and the FTDA dilution claim.  In order to fall within the sphere of protection against dilution the FTDA adds an additional requirement:  the FTDA grants protection only to famous marks.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c);  cf. Gilson &#167; 5.12[a] (calling the FTDA \"a major breakthrough for an elite category of trademark owners\").  The FTDA provides a non-exclusive list of eight factors that courts should consider in determining whether a mark is \"distinctive and famous.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c)(1).  The eight statutory factors are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p>(A) the degree of inherent or acquired distinctiveness of the mark;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p>(B) the duration and extent of use of the mark in connection with the goods or services with which the mark is used;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p>(C) the duration and extent of advertising and publicity of the mark;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p>(D) the geographical extent of the trading area in which the mark is used;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>(E) the channels of trade for the goods or services with which the mark is used;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p>(F) the degree of recognition of the mark in the trading areas and channels of trade used by the marks' owner and the person against whom the injunction is sought;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p>(G) the nature and extent of use of the same or similar marks by third parties;  and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p>(H) whether the mark was registered under the Act of March 3, 1881, or the Act of February 20, 1905, or on the principal register.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. The district court found likelihood of success on the claim that the VOLA's design was a famous mark.  Kohler challenges this finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the text and legislative history of the original bill in 1988 and the FTDA itself indicate a congressional intent that courts should be discriminating and selective in categorizing a mark as famous.  For example, the Senate Judiciary Committee Report on the 1988 precursor bill<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> said the Committee wished \"to underscore its determination that the new dilution provisions should apply only to ... very unique marks.\"  3 McCarthy &#167; 24:92 n. 6 (quoting S.Rep. No. 100-515, at 41-42) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Trademark Review Commission noted that the showing of fame required employment of a \"higher standard\" than fame among an \"appreciable number of persons\" in order to be \"eligible for this extraordinary remedy.\"   Id. n. 8 (quoting The United States Trademark Association Trademark Review Commission Report, 77 Trademark Rep. at 461) (internal quotation marks omitted).  One commentator has referred to this category of famous marks as \"Supermark[s].\"  See Gilson &#167; 5.12[a]. As the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition notes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p>A mark that evokes an association with a specific source only when used in connection with the particular goods or services that it identifies is ordinarily not sufficiently distinctive to be protected against dilution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition &#167; 25 cmt. e (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record here reflects that there was not sufficient attention paid to the heightened fame standard that the FTDA establishes.  The district court found that \"in its market, the VOLA's design is famous and distinctive\" based on its prior analysis under the infringement claim that \"the VOLA mark is strong, and has acquired secondary meaning in its market;  and it has been used for some twenty years in this country.\"  Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 125.   Both the Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition and the state anti-dilution statutes against the background of which Congress enacted the FTDA make clear that the standard for fame and distinctiveness required to obtain anti-dilution protection is more rigorous than that required to seek infringement protection.  See Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition &#167; 25 cmt. e. As one commentator has stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>Certainly, the mere acquisition of secondary meaning to achieve trademark status in a non-inherently distinctive designation is nowhere near sufficient to achieve the status of \"famous mark\" under the anti-dilution statute.  The acquisition of secondary meaning merely establishes the minimum threshold necessary for trademark status:  section 43(c) requires a great deal more.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3 McCarthy &#167; 24:91;  see also Gilson &#167; 5.12[c][ii] (\"A trademark can certainly be distinctive without being famous, but it cannot be famous without being distinctive.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not understand the district court's conclusion about fame, despite some ambiguity, to have rested solely on its conclusion that the VOLA faucet was distinctive (because it had acquired secondary meaning);  any such per se analysis would be erroneous.  But it appears that the district court did not apply the more rigorous definition of fame under the FTDA.  While one can posit a case having very strong facts which support a distinctiveness finding based on secondary meaning and then using those facts to support the separate, more rigorous analysis of fame, the facts in this case do not have such strength.  Lund has a difficult case to establish fame through the product design of the VOLA faucet, and this record is not strong.  There has been no use by Kohler of the VOLA name, or any other name by which the faucet is known.  Kohler's use, if any, is of a like product design.  There is little to suggest that this product design, itself unregistered and not inherently distinctive, is so strong a mark and so well publicized and known that it has achieved the level of fame Congress intended under the Act.  Consumer surveys could be used as evidence of such fame, but consumer surveys are absent from this case.  Additionally, although some marks, such as COCA-COLA, may be so famous as to be judicially noticed, see Gilson &#167; 5.12[c][iii], the VOLA faucet is far from being a candidate for such judicial notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, national renown<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> is an important factor in determining whether a mark qualifies as famous under the FTDA.  Although the district court found that \"in the world of interior design and high-end bathroom fixtures, the VOLA is renowned,\" Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 126, and that the faucet has been featured and advertised in national magazines and displayed in museums, whether the VOLA's identifying design is sufficiently famous to qualify for the FTDA's protection is far from clear.  In light of the rigorous standard for fame, we find that Lund has not met its burden of showing likelihood of success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Dilution</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the FTDA, even if a mark is famous there is no relief unless that mark has been diluted.  As the district court noted, there are two types of dilution recognized:  blurring and tarnishing.  This case involves no claim of tarnishing, an area in which Congress expressed a strong interest.  Further, in light of the finding of no customer confusion, only a particular type of blurring may be involved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intellectual origins of the dilution doctrine are traced to a 1927 Harvard Law Review article, which urged protection against \"the gradual whittling away or dispersion of the identity and hold upon the public mind of the mark or name by its use upon non-competing goods.\"   Schecter, The Rational Basis of Trademark Protection, 40 Harv.  L.Rev. 813, 825 (1927).  Although the origins of the doctrine are concerned with non-competing goods, Congress used language in the FTDA which extends dilution protection even to competing goods.  \"Dilution\" is defined as \"the lessening of the capacity of a famous mark to identify and distinguish good or services.\"  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1127;  see also H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N at 1030 (stating that dilution \"applies when the unauthorized use of a famous mark reduces the public's perception that the mark signifies something unique, singular, or particular\");  3 McCarthy &#167; 24:93 (\"The crux is whether this particular challenged use lessens the capacity of the famous mark to carry out its role as a trademark--namely, to identify and distinguish.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case differs in several respects from usual dilution cases.  First, unlike most claims of dilution by tarnishment or blurring, the aspect of its product that Lund seeks to protect--the design of the VOLA faucet--likely could have been protected by a design patent.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  The possibility of obtaining a design patent is not dispositive of the availability of trade dress protection:  more than one form of intellectual property protection may simultaneously protect particular product features.  Moreover, design patent protection would not have provided protection identical to that sought here.  Nevertheless, the availability of design patent protection does suggest that the claim in this case differs fundamentally from the claims the drafters of the FTDA had in mind--cases where dilution protection is the only form of protection available for a famous mark threatened by unauthorized use of the mark that lessens the mark's capacity to identify its source.  Congress's intent to provide protection where none previously existed is evidenced by the House Report's statement that \"[a] federal dilution statute is necessary because famous marks ordinarily are used on a nationwide basis and dilution protection is currently only available on a patch-quilt system of protection, in that only approximately 25 states have laws that prohibit trademark dilution.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1030.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Lund is seeking protection against a direct competitor.  Although the FTDA states that dilution protection is available against unauthorized use of a famous mark that lessens the mark's ability \"to identify and distinguish goods or services, regardless of the presence or absence of ... competition between the owner of the famous mark and other parties,\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1127 (emphasis added), dilution protection has most often been extended to non-competing uses of a mark, see, e.g., H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1030 (giving examples of \"DUPONT shoes, BUICK aspirin, and KODAK pianos\");  3 McCarthy &#167; 24.72 (noting \"split of authority under ... state statutes as to whether the anti-dilution rule is applicable where the parties are in competition\").  The FTDA recognizes the possibility that dilution may occur in some circumstances where, although some consumers are not confused as to the products' sources, a competitor's use of a mark tarnishes or blurs a senior mark.  Nevertheless, such cases are likely to be exceptions to the more common cases of dilution by non-competing marks.  Dilution laws are intended to address specific harms;  they are not intended to serve as mere fallback protection for trademark owners unable to prove trademark infringement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While there may be a tendency to think of dilution in terms of confusion, Congress made it clear that dilution can occur even in the absence of confusion.  It is simple to see why that should be so when non-competing goods are at issue.  No one would confuse Kodak pianos with Kodak film, but the use of the name on the piano could dilute its effectiveness as a mark for the film.  But Congress did not say that there can be dilution without confusion only among non-competing goods.  As the district court aptly noted, the analysis becomes complicated when the concept of blurring is applied to competing similar products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We deal first with the approach taken by the district court, an approach which had support in precedent.  The district court articulated the standard for determining blurring as follows:  \"Lund must demonstrate that 'the use of a junior mark has caused a lessening of demand for the product or services bearing the famous mark.' \"  Lund I, 11 F.Supp.2d at 126 (quoting Ringling Bros.-Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. Utah Div. of Travel Dev., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></span>, 616 (E.D.Va.1997)).  This, we think, is not the correct standard.  As Kohler observes, demand for one product is almost always lessened whenever a competing product achieves a measurable degree of success.  Further, blurring has to do with the identification of a product and that is not the same thing as a lessening of demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the dilution claim, the district court used the \"Sweet factors,\" named after the six factors set forth in Judge Sweet's concurrence in Mead Data Central, Inc. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524056\"><a href=\"/opinion/524056/mead-data-central-inc-v-toyota-motor-sales-usa-inc-and-toyota/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span>, 1035 (2d Cir.1989) (Sweet, J., concurring), which involved a claim brought under a New York dilution statute.  Some district courts have used these factors to examine whether dilution exists under the FTDA.  See, e.g., Ringling Bros.-Barnum &amp; Bailey Combined Shows, Inc. v. B.E. Windows Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></span>, 211-14 (S.D.N.Y.1996);  WAWA Dairy Farms v. Haaf, 40 U.S.P.Q.2d (BNA) 1629, 1632-33 (E.D.Pa.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></span>, 562 (S.D.N.Y.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler argues that Judge Sweet's six-factor test is inappropriate in determining whether dilution has occurred for purposes of the FTDA.  We agree.  The Sweet factors have been criticized by both courts and commentators for introducing factors that \"are the offspring of classical likelihood of confusion analysis and are not particularly relevant or helpful in resolving the issues of dilution by blurring.\"  3 McCarthy &#167; 24:94.1.  The six Sweet factors are:  \"(1) similarity of the marks (2) similarity of the products covered by the marks (3) sophistication of consumers (4) predatory intent (5) renown of the senior mark [and] (6) renown of the junior mark.\"  Mead Data, 875 F.2d at 1035 (Sweet, J., concurring).  McCarthy urges that only the first and fifth of Judge Sweet's factors--the similarity of the marks and the renown of the senior mark--are relevant to determining whether dilution has occurred.  See 3 McCarthy &#167; 24:94.1;  see also Hershey Foods Corp. v. Mars, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">500</span></span>, 520 (M.D.Pa.1998) (stating that \"whether the products are similar or not adds nothing to the analysis\" because \"dilution can apply to competitors\");  Klieger, Trademark Dilution:  The Whittling Away of the Rational Basis for Trademark Protection, 58 U. Pitt.  L.Rev. 789, 826-27 (1997) (noting that \"few of these factors bear any relation to whether a particular junior use will debilitate the selling power of a mark\" and that \"[s]o long as a mark qualifies for dilution protection and the senior and junior uses of the mark are not so unrelated as to foreclose the possibility of a mental connection, blurring ... is a foregone conclusion\").  These criticisms are well taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's finding of likelihood of dilution by blurring depended on its use of inappropriate Sweet factors.  As McCarthy points out, use of factors such as predatory intent, similarity of products, sophistication of customers, and renown of the junior mark work directly contrary to the intent of a law whose primary purpose was to apply in cases of widely differing goods, i.e. Kodak pianos and Kodak film.  See 3 McCarthy &#167; 24:94.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are difficulties with the Sweet factors even when used with competing goods.  Blurring occurs in the minds of potential customers.  Predatory intent tells little about how customers in fact perceive products.  That customers are sophisticated may well mean less likelihood of blurring.  That customers knowingly choose to pay less to get a similar product, and trade lower price against having a product of greater fame, does not, contrary to Lund's argument, establish blurring.  Indeed, the district court's findings, in the infringement context, of dissimilarity and sophistication of the customers tend to cut against any finding of blurring.  \"The familiar test of similarity used in the traditional likelihood of confusion test cannot be the guide [for dilution analysis], for likelihood of confusion is not the test of dilution.\"  Id. &#167; 24:90.1.  Instead, the inquiry is into whether target customers are likely to view the products \"as essentially the same.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a more fundamental problem here in attempting to apply the dilution analysis to the design itself of the competing product involved.  We doubt that Congress intended the reach of the dilution concept under the FTDA to extend this far and our doubts are heightened by the presence of constitutional constraints.  Where words are the marks at issue it is easy to understand that there can be blurring and tarnishment when there is a completely different product to which the words are applied.  The congressional history described earlier gives such examples.  What is much more difficult is to see how dilution is to be shown where some of a design is partially replicated and the result is largely dissimilar and does not create consumer confusion.  If that is so, as is true here, then it is difficult to see that there has been dilution of the source signaling function of the design (even assuming that such a function has been established through secondary meaning).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, it appears that an entirely different issue is at stake--not interference with the source signaling function but rather protection from an appropriation of or free riding on the investment Lund has made in its design.  That investment is usually given protection by patents, which have a limited duration.  See W.T. Rogers Co., 778 F.2d at 348.   But again, that free riding or appropriation appears to be of the beauty of the object and not of the source, and may in fact be good for consumers.  As the district court observed, these sophisticated buyers know a different source is involved and are, accordingly, most likely purchasing because of the aesthetics.  And even if there is some appropriation or free riding, the extent of it here is not clear.  Certainly it is not plausible to think that Congress intended to protect aesthetic characteristics by simply assuming harm or damages based on the fact that the plaintiff will sell less if the defendant sells more.  What is clear is that the interests here are not the interests at the core of what Congress intended to protect in the FTDA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is possible that Congress did not really envision protection for product design from dilution by a competing product under the FTDA, but the language it used does not permit us to exclude such protection categorically and rare cases can be imagined.  But a broad reading of dilution would bring us close to the constitutional edge, and we decline to attribute such brinksmanship to Congress, and so insist on rigorous review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the interpretation of the fame and dilution requirements for the FTDA set forth today, the requirements for granting the preliminary injunction have not been met.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. Constitutionality of the FTDA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler argues that the FTDA may never constitutionally be applied to enjoin a competitor in a product design trade dress case.  Kohler's constitutional challenge involves two steps.  First, Kohler argues that applying the FTDA to product designs grants patent-like protections for an unlimited period of time.  Second, Kohler argues that Congress's Commerce Clause power--the basis of Congress's regulation of trademarks and trade dress--cannot be used to trump the Patent Clause.  Lund responds that federal anti-dilution legislation is fully consistent with Congress's Commerce Clause power, and that patent and trademark laws protect different interests and serve different goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly noted that Kohler faced a \"very high preliminary injunction standard on their [constitutional] claim,\" and that the statute was \"presumptively constitutional.\"  Lund II, 11 F.Supp.2d at 134. The court concluded that defendant Kohler was unlikely to succeed with its argument that the FTDA is unconstitutional in all product design contexts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kohler's constitutional attack on application of the FTDA here is mooted by our resolution of the injunction issue.  To the extent Kohler is mounting something akin to a facial attack, we think it better not to address constitutional issues in the abstract.  The resolution of any conflict between the Patent Clause and the FTDA is better handled on specific facts which present the issues with clarity, and not on the basis of theoretical impacts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VIII. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both the parties and the district court labored through this case without the benefit of binding precedent on a number of key and difficult issues, particularly the interpretation of the FTDA.  The denial of the preliminary injunction on the infringement claim is affirmed.  The grant of the injunction on the FTDA claim is vacated inasmuch as there were no findings on functionality and standards for determining both fame and dilution under the FTDA were used which are different from those announced today and the evidence does not show probability of success under those standards.  The case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  No costs are awarded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, concurring.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily the creator of something new--a useful device, a pharmaceutical drug, an ornament, a painting--owns any such object that he or she makes but can prevent its replication by others only pursuant to the patent and copyright laws.  A central limitation on patent and copyright protection, stemming from the Constitution itself, is that it is limited in time.  See U.S. Const. art.  I, &#167; 8, cl. 8;  35 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 101, 154 (20-year utility patent);  35 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 171, 173 (14-year design patent);  17 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 302-304 (various limited-time copyrights).  After the period of protection expires, copying by others is allowed.  This case presents, in addition to other problems, the threat that the permanent injunction sought may prevent the Lund faucet from being duplicated forever.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In substance, Lund created a faucet configuration called VOLA that involves a downward curving water pipe protruding from a wall (rather than the sink itself) and a similarly protruding control rod to regulate both water flow and temperature (instead of the usual pair of spigots).  The concept of a wall-based mechanism, and the size and shape and relative proportions of the pipe and control rod, are pleasing to customers.  The resulting VOLA faucet configuration is successful and recognized in the trade.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund has now obtained a preliminary injunction against Kohler forbidding Kohler from selling Kohler's own faucet system that embodies the same concept and a similar but not identically shaped pipe and control rod.  What Lund regards as the scope of its \"monopoly\" is not entirely clear:  all we know is that this Kohler faucet system has been enjoined.  What will be assumed, or else the legal problems would be even greater than they are, is that the concept of a water pipe and control rod protruding from a wall is not sought to be prohibited but only one whose shape and size are similar to VOLA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  Even so, a serious problem exists because the assumed protection (if the preliminary injunction matures into a permanent one) could be perpetual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lund says that this perpetual protection of its design is permitted because its source is not a design patent<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>--Lund has not sought one--but rather the trademark laws.  Trademarks are ordinarily conceived as names (e.g., Kodak) or marks (the AT &amp; T striped circle logo), but trademarks also include so-called \"trade dress,\" see 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1127;  and this in turn includes the ornamental design of an article where the design performs the traditional \"source signaling\" function of trademarks.  Usually, this is achieved by the \"wrapping\" (e.g., the classic Coca Cola bottle) or some ornament affixed to the product (the star symbol on the Mercedes hood);  but the design of the product itself can sometimes qualify.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A permanent restriction on copying the design of a product might still seem offensive to patent and copyright policy, but at least this protection can be explained where the replication would otherwise confuse buyers as to source, traditionally the concern of trademark protection.  The difficulty in this case arises because Congress has removed the requirement of confusion for protection of \"famous\" trademarks and said that, in the alternative, they will be protected against \"dilution\" even where no confusion exists as to source.  15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c).  Congress was worried that even without customer confusion as to source a famous trade name or mark, like \"Kodak,\" could be blurred or degraded by being attached by others to their own products (e.g., sports clothing, dog food).  See 141 Cong. Rec.  S19306, S19310 (daily ed.  Dec. 29, 1995) (statement of Sen.  Hatch).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast to a trademark consisting of a name or insignia, a product design will not often qualify as a trademark inviting protection from dilution.  A trade name or device usually identifies source, but the design of the product itself in most cases makes the product more efficient, attractive, or both.  If more efficient, trademark protection is foreclosed altogether under the \"functionality\" doctrine, see Qualitex, 514 U.S. at 164, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117913\"><a href=\"/opinion/117913/qualitex-co-v-jacobson-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2753</span></a></span>;  and if attractiveness is the primary function, the product design does not normally qualify as a candidate to achieve secondary meaning and thus trademark status.  See Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110720\"><a href=\"/opinion/110720/inwood-laboratories-inc-v-ives-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span>, 851 n. 11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110720\"><a href=\"/opinion/110720/inwood-laboratories-inc-v-ives-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span> (1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But conceivably in some rare case a product design might have source signaling as its main function (perhaps the old 1950's Cadillac tail fin might be an instance) and be copied by a competitor (say, for Volkswagen Beetles) without any risk of customer confusion.  At that point, if the new trademark statute is taken literally, Cadillac might then claim a permanent monopoly on its tail fin design, subject only to a showing that Volkswagen's use threatened to \"dilute\" the strength of that tail fin as a Cadillac trademark.  See 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1125(c).  One may wonder whether Congress ever contemplated such a result, but the statute's language arguably permits it or at least does not explicitly foreclose the possibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If so, much turns on how dilution is defined and proved.  The federal statute is recent, but state laws have protected against dilution for some time, and under those statutes there is some tendency to assume that dilution is threatened wherever the famous trademark is copied.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a>  After all, the concern is with the long-term \"whittling away\" of the strength of the mark by other unauthorized uses, see L.L. Bean, Inc. v. Drake Publishers, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482847\"><a href=\"/opinion/482847/ll-bean-inc-v-drake-publishers-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">811</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir.1987), and, absent confusion, there may be no immediate damage from any single use.  Where only a word or symbol is forever preempted, this protective approach toward the trademark may make sense, and in all events does not pose much risk to the policies of the patent and copyright clauses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The situation is quite different where design of an article is given permanent protection without any threat of confusion.  If buyers prefer articles of that design, then the public pays a price whenever the design cannot eventually be used by other manufacturers.  In the case of patents and copyrights, the foreclosure of competition is deemed a price worth paying for a limited time--in order to induce such creations--but only for a limited time.  Is this policy of time-limited protection, constitutional at its core, overcome wherever dilution is threatened--even though no confusion can be proved and any impairment of the trademark may be only potential and directed primarily to protecting the seller rather than the public?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might point to the possible diversion of sales from Lund to Kohler as practical harm in this very case.  Yet such diversion does not prove either confusion or dilution:  a copied product can easily take sales from the original manufacturer if the copied product is better made or sold at a lower price or the design is slightly better--outcomes generally beneficial to the public.  Giving weight to diversion of sales, in the absence of confusion of customers, simply underscores that the protection is generally similar to that afforded for patented articles--save that the protection here may be unlimited in time.  Giving patent-like protection a new name does not avoid constitutional limitations.  Cf. Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112199\"><a href=\"/opinion/112199/bonito-boats-inc-v-thunder-craft-boats-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 146, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112199\"><a href=\"/opinion/112199/bonito-boats-inc-v-thunder-craft-boats-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See H.R.Rep. No. 104-374, at 3 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1030.   And the threat to the public interest, ordinarily countered by the time limit on patent protection, is acute where a permanent protection is offered not to a word or symbol but to the design of an article of manufacture.  In such an instance, it is a difficult constitutional question whether protecting the investment can outweigh the public interest in replication, a question best deferred unless and until all other preconditions for protection are resolved in favor and decision on this last issue is absolutely necessary.
