Peter Duriex-Gauthier held the\n\nposition of Personnel and General Services Officer in the\n\nOmbudsman’s Office of Puerto Rico from December 1991 to August\n\n31, 1998.    Following the termination of his employment, he sued\n\nCarlos    Lopez-Nieves,      the   newly     appointed   Director   of    the\n\nOmbudsman’s Office, in Lopez-Nieves’s personal and official\n\ncapacities.       Duriex-Gauthier made two claims.       First, he argued\n\nthat his firing was in violation of his First Amendment rights\n\nin that Lopez-Nieves, a member of the New Progressive Party\n\n(NPP), terminated his employment because Duriex-Gauthier was a\n\nPopular Democratic Party (PDP) member and that his position was\n\nnot   a   position     for     which    political   affiliation     was   an\n\nappropriate consideration.         Rutan v. Republican Party, 497 U.S.\n\n62, 71 (1990);      Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507 (1980).          Second,\n\nhe says that he was in a tenured position under Puerto Rico law\n\nand his firing violated his procedural due process rights.\n\nDuriex-Gauthier sought damages and reinstatement.\n\n            The    defendant    moved    for   summary   judgment   on    the\n\nquestion of qualified immunity as to both claims.            The district\n\n                                       -2-\n\fcourt denied the motion on all grounds.           Duriex-Gauthier v.\n\nLopez-Nieves, 135 F. Supp. 2d 311 (D.P.R. 2001).            Defendant\n\nappeals.1   We have jurisdiction over an appeal from a denial of\n\nsummary judgment on the grounds of qualified immunity where the\n\ndenial turns on an issue of law. Behrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S.\n\n299, 306 (1996); Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530 (1985).\n\nOur jurisdiction over the issue of the defendants' qualified\n\nimmunity from monetary damages is not contested.\n\n                                  I.\n\n            The Ombudsman’s Office was created by statute, as an\n\nadjunct to the Legislature of Puerto Rico.       Ombudsman Act, 1977\n\nP.R. Laws 134 (codified as amended at 2 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 701-\n\n726 (1994)).    Thus, unlike most political termination claims,\n\nthe executive branch is not at issue here.          The Ombudsman is\n\nappointed for a fixed six-year term of office, 2 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§ 704, and so is outside the four-year electoral cycle.          He is\n\nappointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the\n\n\n     1     Defendant denies the discharge was politically motivated.\nThis disputed fact is immaterial to whether plaintiff’s position was a\nposition for which political affiliation is appropriate or to whether\nthe defendant could have reasonably believed it was so. Defendant also\nmoved for summary judgment on the merits; we have no appellate\njurisdiction over that aspect of the denial of the motion except to the\nextent that the issues are implicated in the immunity issue.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fPuerto Rico legislature, and is statutorily limited to no more\n\nthan two terms of office.        Id.\n\n          The duties of the Ombudsman’s Office are to investigate\n\nthe   administrative      acts    of     the   agencies     and   conduct\n\ninvestigations of citizens' claims.            2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 710.\n\nThe   Ombudsman    is   authorized     to   adopt   and   promulgate   the\n\nnecessary rules and regulations to carry out the duties of his\n\nOffice and to establish regulations for the filing and handling\n\nof complaints, procedures for investigations, the manner of\n\ninforming his findings, and the personnel administration of his\n\noffice.   Id. § 708.       After completing an investigation, the\n\nOmbudsman may recommend a remedy, including, for example, that\n\nan administrative act should be altered or set aside, that the\n\nlaw or regulations on which the administrative act is based\n\nshould be modified, or that the agency should perform another\n\naction. 2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 717.\n\n          Puerto Rico does have a civil service system, called\n\nthe Puerto Rico Service Personnel Act, 3 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 1301-\n\n1421 (1994).      The Personnel Act, however, does not apply to the\n\nLegislative Branch, id. § 1338(a), and so does not apply to the\n\nOmbudsman’s Office. The original 1977 Ombudsman Act stated that\n\n                                   -4-\n\fall employees in the Office were to be considered as \"trust\"\n\nemployees, as used in the Personnel Act, which in turn specifies\n\nthat such employees are subject to free removal. 1977 P.R. Laws\n\n134, art. 7; 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1350.      The Ombudsman Act also\n\nauthorizes the Ombudsman to adopt regulations to administer the\n\npersonnel of that Office.   2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 703.\n\n         The pertinent regulation here is Regulation No. 86-3.\n\nThat Regulation contains two seemingly inconsistent sections.\n\nSection V, entitled “Office Composition,” states that the Office\n\nis excluded from the Personnel Act and that \"all the employees\n\nof the Ombudsman’s Office are of free selection and removal.\"\n\nThe defendant relies heavily on this section.\n\n         However, in Section XVIII of the Regulation, entitled\n\n“Retention in Service,\" subsection A, entitled \"Employment\n\nSecurity,\" states that \"[t]he employees of the Office of the\n\nOmbudsman will have tenure in their positions, if they satisfy\n\nthe criteria of productivity, efficiency, order and discipline\n\nthat should prevail in the public service.       Plaintiff relies\n\nheavily on this section.\n\n         Section   VI,   entitled    \"Recruitment,   Selection   and\n\nRemoval of Employees,\" is also pertinent, as it appears to carve\n\n                               -5-\n\fout   an   exception    to   Section   XVIII's   tenure   provision   for\n\nemployees designated as \"trust\" employees. Section VI provides:\n\n           1. In the case of employees of trust and confidence\n           whose duties have to do with the formulation of public\n           policy and those who offer personal service directly\n           to the Ombudsman, the provisions of this Regulation\n           will not be mandatory in reference to the recruitment,\n           selection and removal.\n\n           . . . .\n\n           3. The trust and confidence employees, whether it be\n           that they participate in the formulation of public\n           policy or provide personal or direct services to the\n           Ombudsman, will be of free removal.\n\n           A 1987 amendment to the Ombudsman Act eliminated the\n\nAct's statement that all employees would be in the trust\n\nservice,    clarified    that   employees   were   excluded   from    the\n\nPersonnel Act, and provided that the Ombudsman’s Personnel\n\nRegulation shall apply to employees of the Office. 2 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn.§ 707.    The Ombudsman's Personnel Regulations cited above\n\nremained unchanged.2 Duriex-Gauthier says this was a scrivner’s\n\n\n      2    However, on September 22, 1987, the then-Ombudsman, Mr. R.\nAdolfo de Castro, issued an Administrative Order to amend Section 5 of\nRegulation 86-3.      This Administrative Order named four job\nclassifications, comprising six positions, that would be regarded as\n“officers of strict confidence to the Ombudsman”: one deputy ombudsman,\ntwo executive secretaries, one special aide and two drivers.\nPlaintiff’s job was not included. Defendant points out that these six\npositions were ones of strict confidence, which does not mean that\nplaintiff’s position was not also one of confidence.\n\n                                   -6-\n\ferror,   that   the   regulation    stating   that   the   Ombudsman's\n\nemployees are of free selection and removal should have been\n\neliminated when the statute was amended.             Nonetheless, the\n\nregulation remains.\n\n          Duriex-Gauthier was hired in the Office starting in\n\n1986, when it was then under the Directorship of a PDP member,\n\nand was promoted to various positions until he became head of\n\nPersonnel and General Services in 1991.        The forms filed with\n\nthe Central Office of Personnel Administration, a different\n\nagency, describe him as a trust and confidence employee.          His\n\nvarious employment contracts stated that each of his positions\n\nwas a “trust” position.3 This is a term of art in the government\n\nof Puerto Rico, defined within the civil service law as \"those\n\nwho intervene or collaborate substantially in the formulation of\n\nthe public policy, who advise directly or render direct services\n\nto the head of the agency.\"        3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1350 (1994).\n\nThe original statute creating the Ombudsman's Office referenced\n\nthis definition, and Section VI of the Ombudsman's Regulations,\n\n     3    This is translated from the Spanish term \"confianza,\" which\nis alternately translated as \"trust,\" \"confidence,\" or \"trust and\nconfidence\" in the record here and in our past cases. We will use the\ntranslations provided to us, and the reader should be aware that,\nalthough the terminology may vary, the substance remains the same.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fquoted above, mirrors the Personnel Act definition as well,\n\nsuggesting that this term was meant to have the same meaning\n\nwithin the Ombudsman's Office.\n\n          Carlos     Lopez-Nieves,      a     NPP    member,   was   appointed\n\nOmbudsman on July 21, 1998.          In August 27, 1998, Lopez-Nieves\n\nsent a termination letter to Duriex-Gauthier which did not state\n\nany grounds for his termination, but said his position was one\n\nof trust. Duriex-Gauthier contests whether his position was one\n\nof trust, arguing that the Regulations cited above gave him\n\ntenure in his position, thereby changing his position from one\n\nof trust into one of right.          He further argues that his actual\n\nduties   lacked     the    hallmarks    of    such    a   position,   namely,\n\nsubstantial involvement in policymaking and direct advising or\n\nservices to the agency head.\n\n          As   to    the    debate     over    whether    Duriex-Gauthier's\n\nposition was one of trust, this court has previously indicated\n\nthat designating a position as one of \"trust\" indicates that it\n\nis considered a policymaking position under Puerto Rican law,\n\nwhich is not dispositive of the federal question under Rutan,\n\n497 U.S. 62, and Branti, 445 U.S. 507, but is entitled to some\n\ndeference by this court.        Roldan-Plumey v. Cerezo-Suarez, 115\n\n                                     -8-\n\fF.3d 58, 64-65 (1st Cir. 1997); Ortiz-Pinero v. Rivera-Arroyo,\n\n84 F.3d 7, 16 (1st Cir. 1996).      We have consistently held that\n\nthe job description is the best, and sometimes dispositive,\n\nsource for determining the inherent functions of the position.\n\nRoldan-Plumey, 115 F.3d at 62.4\n\n          During plaintiff’s employment as Personnel Officer, the\n\njob description for the position provided:\n\n          Duties of Position:\n          This is a technical and administrative job of great\n          complexity and responsibility in the field of\n          personnel administration comprising the performance of\n          a series of tasks with a large variety. The employee\n          would receive general and specific instructions on the\n          work to be performed. The employee shall work with\n          great technical independence responding directly to\n          the Deputy Ombudsman of the office as to the\n          conformity of its job with the rules set forth.\n\n          Shall perform the following duties:\n\n          Shall be responsible for the planning and supervision\n          of all the personnel activities including the\n          classification and compensation aspects of the\n          positions, training, transactions, leaves, payrolls,\n          personnel relations and similar aspects in the\n          personnel administration field.\n\n\n\n\n     4    We have also looked to information such as the size of the\nagency and where the position is in the management structure. See\nFlynn v. City of Boston, 140 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 1997).\nUnfortunately, defendants have not provided any such information in the\nrecord.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f            Shall interpret and apply the laws and regulations\n            governing personnel administration.\n\n            Shall analyze         the    problems        of    organization    and\n            procedures.\n\n            Shall plan, assign and organize the work of the\n            personnel unit.\n\n            Shall act as the liaison officer between the Office\n            and COPA [the Central Office for the Administration of\n            Personnel].\n\n            Shall perform other jobs similar to this.\n\n\"[D]uties     prevail      over     titles;         everything      depends      on\n\ncircumstances.\"       Flynn v. City of Boston, 140 F.3d 42, 44 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).    We turn to the summary judgment issues.\n\n                                        II.\n\nA.   Qualified Immunity on First Amendment Claim\n\n            The general test for qualified immunity is often stated\n\nas a two-part test.         First, was the constitutional right in\n\nquestion    clearly     established           at   the   time?      Anderson     v.\n\nCreighton,    483   U.S.    635,        638    (1987).         Second,   would   a\n\nreasonable, similarly situated individual understand that the\n\nchallenged conduct violated that established right?                      Swain v.\n\nSpinney, 117 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1997).                       Whether a right is\n\n\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fclearly established is an issue of law for the court.    Elder v.\n\nHolloway, 510 U.S. 510, 516 (1994).\n\n         The test for qualified immunity in cases involving\n\npolitical firing claims is well established.   \"[T]o decide the\n\n'qualified immunity' issue, we need only determine whether the\n\nplaintiff[’s] position[] 'potentially' concerned matters of\n\npartisan political interest and involved a 'modicum' of policy-\n\nmaking responsibility, access to confidential information, or\n\nofficial communication.\" Zayas-Rodriguez v. Hernandez, 830 F.2d\n\n1, 2 (1st Cir. 1987); see also Juarbe-Angueira v. Arias, 831\n\nF.2d 11, 14 (1st Cir. 1987); Mendez-Palou v. Rohena-Betancourt,\n\n813 F.2d 1255, 1259 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n         The Supreme Court has, however, noted the importance\n\nof providing certainty as to what are the clearly established\n\nrules of primary conduct for government officials.      County of\n\nSacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 841 n. 5 (1998).   Rulings on\n\nqualified immunity grounds avoid reaching the issue of whether\n\nthere is a violation at all.   For these reasons, the Court has\n\nexpressed that “the better approach to resolving cases in which\n\nthe defense of qualified immunity is raised is to determine\n\nfirst whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a\n\n                               -11-\n\fconstitutional right at all.”     Id.   See Siegert v. Gilley, 500\n\nU.S. 226, 232 (1991).         Because we consider this an issue\n\nconcerning the primary conduct of government officials, we turn\n\nto it.\n\n\n\n\n1. Merits of First Amendment Claim\n\n            There is no issue about the general existence of the\n\nFirst Amendment right at issue here; this case turns rather on\n\nwhether the right extends to persons in this position.        This\n\ncircuit has established a two-part test to determine whether\n\n“the hiring authority” can demonstrate that party affiliation is\n\nan appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the\n\npublic office involved.   Jimenez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide,\n\n807 F.2d 236 (1st Cir. 1986) (en banc). In Jimenez Fuentes, this\n\ncourt described the two prongs.         Id. at 241-42.   First, we\n\ndetermine    whether   \"the     position   involve[s]    government\n\ndecisionmaking on issues where there is room for political\n\ndisagreement on goals or their implementation.\" Id.      Second, we\n\n\"examine the particular responsibilities of the position to\n\ndetermine whether it resembles a policymaker, [one] privy to\n\n                                -12-\n\fconfidential information, a communicator, or some other office\n\nholder whose function is such that party affiliation is an\n\nequally appropriate requirement.\"            Id. at 242; see also Roldan-\n\nPlumey, 115 F.3d at 62; Ortiz-Pinero, 84 F.3d at 12; O’Connor v.\n\nSteeves, 994 F.2d 905, 910 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n             The district court found that plaintiff had waived any\n\nissue   on    the    first   prong   by     failing    to    respond   to   the\n\ndefendant's contention that the duties of the Office of the\n\nOmbudsman involve decionmaking where there is room for political\n\ndisagreement.       Duriex-Gauthier, 135 F. Supp. 2d at 315.              As to\n\nthe second prong, the district court found in plaintiff’s favor\n\nthat \"the duties of          [plaintiff’s position] are those of a\n\ntypical technocrat.\"         Id. at 316.         The court discounted as\n\nfactually inapposite numerous decisions of this court finding\n\npersonnel     directors'     positions      to   be   ones   in   which   party\n\naffiliation was, in the requisite sense, an appropriate job\n\nrequirement.        Id. (citing Cordero v. De Jesus-Mendez, 867 F.2d\n\n1, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1989) (personnel director of municipality)\n\nand Zayas-Rodriguez, 830 F.2d at 3 (director of personnel of\n\nPuerto Rico Highway Authority)).             The court ultimately denied\n\nsummary judgment on the ground that \"plaintiff’s position was\n\n                                     -13-\n\fthat of a technocrat devoid of even a modicum of policymaking or\n\nconfidential responsibilities.\"          Id. at 317.\n\n           Duriex-Gauthier's job description describes a Personnel\n\nDirector   \"with     great   technical    independence\"   who   reported\n\ndirectly to the number two person in the agency.            He was not\n\nlimited to merely making recommendations on personnel matters,\n\nbut   rather   was    also   \"responsible     for   the   planning   and\n\nsupervision of all the personnel activities.\"               His duties\n\nincluded analyzing the problems of organization and procedures\n\nand interpreting and applying the personnel laws.          Further, the\n\nduties explicitly included a liaison role with the Central\n\nOffice for the Administration of Personnel. These duties appear\n\nto fit comfortably within the second prong of the Jimenez\n\nFuentes test, and are strikingly similar to the duties of the\n\npersonnel director in the Cordero case.          867 F.2d at 11-12. In\n\nthis circuit we\n\n      have regularly upheld against First Amendment\n      challenge the dismissal on political grounds of mid-\n      or upper-level officials or employees who are\n      significantly connected to policy-making. This result\n      has followed where the plaintiff merely represented\n      the agency’s policy positions to other entities or to\n      the public or where important personnel functions were\n      part of the portfolio.\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fFlynn, 140 F.3d at 45.\n\n           This conclusion is reinforced by the description of the\n\nposition in each of plaintiff’s employment contracts as a trust\n\nposition, and by Section VI of Regulation 86, which states that\n\ntrust employees of the Ombudsman's Office are subject to free\n\nremoval.   We also note that under Puerto Rican law, personnel\n\ndirectors are often considered to be trust employees. Franco v.\n\nMunicipio de Cidra, 113 P.R. Dec. 260, 263 (1982) (noting that\n\nbecause mayor had delegated his statutory authority to name\n\nemployees to the personnel director, who had primary authority\n\nfor advising mayor on personnel matters, position was \"ipso\n\njure\" one of trust).     While the labels do not determine the\n\noutcome, Ortiz-Pinero, 84 F.3d at 12, the labels here coincide\n\nwith an objectively reasonable conclusion that the duties are\n\nthose of a position exempt from the Branti/Rutan rule.\n\n           Duriex-Gauthier attempts to avoid this conclusion with\n\nan argument that the very nature of the Ombudsman’s Office is\n\nnon-political and so plaintiff must be protected by the First\n\nAmendment. Plaintiff stresses that the Ombudsman is not part of\n\nthe executive branch but of the legislative branch, and that the\n\nOmbudsman is appointed for a six-year term deliberately to\n\n                               -15-\n\fremove him from the four-year electoral cycle.5              Our precedent\n\nhas not been restricted to the executive branch. This court has\n\nroutinely applied Branti to public agencies, such as the Puerto\n\nRico Highway Authority, and has found certain top level jobs to\n\nbe excluded.        Zayas-Rodriguez, 830 F.2d at 304.        The ultimate\n\nquestion is whether the position is one in which political\n\naffiliation is a reasonably necessary requirement; if so the\n\nposition is an exception to the Branti/Rutan standard.                  That\n\nquestion rarely permits a categorical answer and nothing in the\n\nSupreme Court caselaw limits the positions for which political\n\naffiliation is appropriate to the executive branch.              Moreover,\n\nthe Ombudsman is attached by law to the legislative branch, the\n\nbranch    in   which   partisan   political    concerns   are    at   their\n\nstrongest.      The Ombudsman is appointed by the governor and must\n\nbe approved by a majority of all members of the legislative\n\nbranch.      2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 704.          Although the Ombudsman's\n\nappointment may reflect a compromise between political parties,\n\nat   least     in   instances   where   opposing   parties    control   the\n\n\n     5     Plaintiff stated in his brief that the Ombudsman is appointed\nto a ten-year term. However, the Ombudsman, according to the statute,\nis appointed to a six-year term. 2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 704. The mistake\nis irrelevant to our analysis.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fexecutive and the legislature, we think it clear that the\n\noverall   functions   of    the    Ombudsman    “involve     government\n\ndecisionmaking on issues where there is room for political\n\ndisagreement   on   goals   or    their   implementation,”     Jimenez\n\nFuentes, 807 F.2d at    241-42, such as decisions about which\n\ninvestigations to undertake and on which issues to focus.\n\nPlaintiff was hired by a PDP Director and fired by a NPP\n\nDirector, each of whom may have taken different approaches to\n\nthe Ombudsman's duties based on party affiliation.\n\n\n\n\n2.   Application of Qualified Immunity Standard\n\n          Even had we not addressed whether plaintiff's position\n\nwas a protected position, immunity should have been granted.\n\nWhile the district court could have granted immunity on the\n\nbasis that it was clear that the position was one for which\n\nparty affiliation was appropriate, it could not deny immunity on\n\nthe basis that in its view the position was not.           That ruling\n\ndoes not dispose of immunity but simply brings the court to the\n\ndispositive question:   whether an objectively reasonable person\n\nin Lopez-Nieves's position could conclude that Duriex-Gauthier's\n\n                                  -17-\n\fposition \"'potentially' concerned matters of partisan political\n\ninterest     and    involved       a      'modicum'      of    policy-making\n\nresponsibility, access to confidential information, or official\n\ncommunication.\"     Zayas-Rodriguez, 830 F.2d at 2.             The answer to\n\nthe appropriate question leads to the conclusion that Lopez-\n\nNieves was entitled to immunity.\n\n            In previous cases, we have granted immunity partially\n\nbecause a defendant might reasonably rely, even if mistakenly\n\nso, on the position’s status as “confidential or trust” under\n\nthe Puerto Rico Public Service Act. See Roldan-Plumey, 115 F.3d\n\nat 65.      Here, we think an objectively reasonable person in\n\ndefendant’s position could conclude both that Duriex-Gauthier’s\n\nposition as Personnel Director was not a protected position,\n\nparticularly in light of our previous decisions holding that\n\npersonnel directors were not protected, of Duriex-Gauthier's\n\ncontract and job description, and of Regulation 86, which\n\nindicated that his position was one of free removal.\n\nB.   Qualified Immunity on Due Process Claim\n\n            On the due process claim, the only issue before us is\n\nwhether    defendant      is   entitled       to   qualified   immunity,   and\n\ntherefore    the   only    question      we    need   answer   is   whether   a\n\n                                       -18-\n\freasonable person in Lopez-Nieves's position would have thought\n\nthat firing Duriex-Gauthier violated his due process rights.\n\nThe due process claim turns on whether Duriex-Gauthier had a\n\nproperty interest in his job, which is a question of Puerto\n\nRican law.   See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S.\n\n532, 538 (1985).   There is no strong federal concern to provide\n\nguidance as to the primary conduct of Puerto Rican government\n\nofficials here.    Plaintiff’s theory is that he was neither a\n\nconfidence nor a trust employee under state law, but was an\n\nemployee entitled to “tenure” under Section VXIII of Regulation\n\n86 and so had a property interest in his job.        If he did have\n\nsuch an interest, he could not be deprived of it without due\n\nprocess of law.\n\n          It is unclear to us whether the process he claims is\n\ndue is that set forth in Regulation 86 or in the Personnel Law.6\n\nThe tensions between Sections XVIII and Section V of Regulation\n\n86 may create some ambiguity as to whether Ombudsman's Office\n\n\n     6     The existence of these processes raises a question of the\nnature of plaintiff’s due process claim, if any, and the nature of any\nrelief available in light of the Parratt-Hudson doctrine. See O’Neill\nv. Baker, 210 F.3d 41, 50 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing Parratt v. Taylor,\n451 U.S. 527 (1981) and Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517 (1984)). But\nsee Zinerman v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 133-37 (1990) (discussing the\nlimits of Parrat-Hudson doctrine).\n\n                                -19-\n\femployees are generally subject to free removal or have tenure.\n\nHowever, Duriex-Gauthier's position does not seem to fall within\n\nthat ambiguity; Section VI appears to create an exception to\n\nSection XVIII for employees who occupy trust positions, which\n\nDuriex-Gauthier's contract says he did. It suffices to say that\n\nLopez-Nieves   could   reasonably   have   concluded   that   Duriex-\n\nGauthier did not have a property interest in his job under\n\nRegulation 86.   As to the Personnel Act, there is law to the\n\neffect that one not recruited according to the merit principle\n\nembodied in that Act, 2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1333, has no right to\n\nthe processes provided by the Act.     Colon Perez v. Alcalde del\n\nMunicipio de Ceiba, 112 P.R. Dec. 740, 747 (1982). Lopez-Nieves\n\nhas produced an unrebutted affidavit to the effect that Duriex-\n\nGauthier was not so recruited and therefore it appears that the\n\nplaintiff has no property right under the Personnel Act.       Thus,\n\nwe cannot say a reasonable director could not objectively\n\nconclude there was no property interest involved.\n\n\n\n                               III.\n\n         Accordingly, we reverse the district court, and remand\n\nwith directions that defendant be granted qualified immunity as\n\n                               -20-\n\fto all claims, that the First Amendment claim be dismissed, and\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion on the\n\nplaintiff's claim for injunctive relief on the alleged due\n\nprocess violation.\n\n\n\n\n                             -21-\n\f",

Peter Duriex-Gauthier held the\n\nposition of Personnel and General Services Officer in the\n\nOmbudsman’s Office of Puerto Rico from December 1991 to August\n\n31, 1998.    Following the termination of his employment, he sued\n\nCarlos    Lopez-Nieves,      the   newly     appointed   Director   of    the\n\nOmbudsman’s Office, in Lopez-Nieves’s personal and official\n\ncapacities.       Duriex-Gauthier made two claims.       First, he argued\n\nthat his firing was in violation of his First Amendment rights\n\nin that Lopez-Nieves, a member of the New Progressive Party\n\n(NPP), terminated his employment because Duriex-Gauthier was a\n\nPopular Democratic Party (PDP) member and that his position was\n\nnot   a   position     for     which    political   affiliation     was   an\n\nappropriate consideration.

Ombudsman Act, 1977\n\nP.R. Laws 134 (codified as amended at 2 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 701-\n\n726 (1994)).    Thus, unlike most political termination claims,\n\nthe executive branch is not at issue here.          The Ombudsman is\n\nappointed for a fixed six-year term of office, 2 P.R. Laws Ann.\n\n§ 704, and so is outside the four-year electoral cycle.          He is\n\nappointed by the Governor, with the advice and consent of the\n\n\n     1     Defendant denies the discharge was politically motivated.\nThis disputed fact is immaterial to whether plaintiff’s position was a\nposition for which political affiliation is appropriate or to whether\nthe defendant could have reasonably believed it was so. Defendant also\nmoved for summary judgment on the merits; we have no appellate\njurisdiction over that aspect of the denial of the motion except to the\nextent that the issues are implicated in the immunity issue.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fPuerto Rico legislature, and is statutorily limited to no more\n\nthan two terms of office.        Id.\n\n          The duties of the Ombudsman’s Office are to investigate\n\nthe   administrative      acts    of     the   agencies     and   conduct\n\ninvestigations of citizens' claims.            2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 710.\n\nThe   Ombudsman    is   authorized     to   adopt   and   promulgate   the\n\nnecessary rules and regulations to carry out the duties of his\n\nOffice and to establish regulations for the filing and handling\n\nof complaints, procedures for investigations, the manner of\n\ninforming his findings, and the personnel administration of his\n\noffice.   Id. § 708.       After completing an investigation, the\n\nOmbudsman may recommend a remedy, including, for example, that\n\nan administrative act should be altered or set aside, that the\n\nlaw or regulations on which the administrative act is based\n\nshould be modified, or that the agency should perform another\n\naction. 2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 717.\n\n          Puerto Rico does have a civil service system, called\n\nthe Puerto Rico Service Personnel Act, 3 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 1301-\n\n1421 (1994).      The Personnel Act, however, does not apply to the\n\nLegislative Branch, id. § 1338(a), and so does not apply to the\n\nOmbudsman’s Office. The original 1977 Ombudsman Act stated that\n\n                                   -4-\n\fall employees in the Office were to be considered as \"trust\"\n\nemployees, as used in the Personnel Act, which in turn specifies\n\nthat such employees are subject to free removal. 1977 P.R. Laws\n\n134, art. 7; 3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1350.      The Ombudsman Act also\n\nauthorizes the Ombudsman to adopt regulations to administer the\n\npersonnel of that Office.   2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 703.\n\n         The pertinent regulation here is Regulation No. 86-3.\n\nThat Regulation contains two seemingly inconsistent sections.\n\nSection V, entitled “Office Composition,” states that the Office\n\nis excluded from the Personnel Act and that \"all the employees\n\nof the Ombudsman’s Office are of free selection and removal.\"\n\nThe defendant relies heavily on this section.\n\n         However, in Section XVIII of the Regulation, entitled\n\n“Retention in Service,\" subsection A, entitled \"Employment\n\nSecurity,\" states that \"[t]he employees of the Office of the\n\nOmbudsman will have tenure in their positions, if they satisfy\n\nthe criteria of productivity, efficiency, order and discipline\n\nthat should prevail in the public service.       Plaintiff relies\n\nheavily on this section.\n\n         Section   VI,   entitled    \"Recruitment,   Selection   and\n\nRemoval of Employees,\" is also pertinent, as it appears to carve\n\n                               -5-\n\fout   an   exception    to   Section   XVIII's   tenure   provision   for\n\nemployees designated as \"trust\" employees. Section VI provides:\n\n           1. In the case of employees of trust and confidence\n           whose duties have to do with the formulation of public\n           policy and those who offer personal service directly\n           to the Ombudsman, the provisions of this Regulation\n           will not be mandatory in reference to the recruitment,\n           selection and removal.\n\n           . . . .\n\n           3. The trust and confidence employees, whether it be\n           that they participate in the formulation of public\n           policy or provide personal or direct services to the\n           Ombudsman, will be of free removal.\n\n           A 1987 amendment to the Ombudsman Act eliminated the\n\nAct's statement that all employees would be in the trust\n\nservice,    clarified    that   employees   were   excluded   from    the\n\nPersonnel Act, and provided that the Ombudsman’s Personnel\n\nRegulation shall apply to employees of the Office. 2 P.R. Laws\n\nAnn.§ 707.    The Ombudsman's Personnel Regulations cited above\n\nremained unchanged.2 Duriex-Gauthier says this was a scrivner’s\n\n\n      2    However, on September 22, 1987, the then-Ombudsman, Mr. R.\nAdolfo de Castro, issued an Administrative Order to amend Section 5 of\nRegulation 86-3.      This Administrative Order named four job\nclassifications, comprising six positions, that would be regarded as\n“officers of strict confidence to the Ombudsman”: one deputy ombudsman,\ntwo executive secretaries, one special aide and two drivers.\nPlaintiff’s job was not included. Defendant points out that these six\npositions were ones of strict confidence, which does not mean that\nplaintiff’s position was not also one of confidence.\n\n                                   -6-\n\ferror,   that   the   regulation    stating   that   the   Ombudsman's\n\nemployees are of free selection and removal should have been\n\neliminated when the statute was amended.             Nonetheless, the\n\nregulation remains.\n\n          Duriex-Gauthier was hired in the Office starting in\n\n1986, when it was then under the Directorship of a PDP member,\n\nand was promoted to various positions until he became head of\n\nPersonnel and General Services in 1991.        The forms filed with\n\nthe Central Office of Personnel Administration, a different\n\nagency, describe him as a trust and confidence employee.          His\n\nvarious employment contracts stated that each of his positions\n\nwas a “trust” position.3 This is a term of art in the government\n\nof Puerto Rico, defined within the civil service law as \"those\n\nwho intervene or collaborate substantially in the formulation of\n\nthe public policy, who advise directly or render direct services\n\nto the head of the agency.\"        3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1350 (1994).\n\nThe original statute creating the Ombudsman's Office referenced\n\nthis definition, and Section VI of the Ombudsman's Regulations,\n\n     3    This is translated from the Spanish term \"confianza,\" which\nis alternately translated as \"trust,\" \"confidence,\" or \"trust and\nconfidence\" in the record here and in our past cases. We will use the\ntranslations provided to us, and the reader should be aware that,\nalthough the terminology may vary, the substance remains the same.\n\n                                   -7-\n\fquoted above, mirrors the Personnel Act definition as well,\n\nsuggesting that this term was meant to have the same meaning\n\nwithin the Ombudsman's Office.\n\n          Carlos     Lopez-Nieves,      a     NPP    member,   was   appointed\n\nOmbudsman on July 21, 1998.

The court discounted as\n\nfactually inapposite numerous decisions of this court finding\n\npersonnel     directors'     positions      to   be   ones   in   which   party\n\naffiliation was, in the requisite sense, an appropriate job\n\nrequirement.

The court ultimately denied\n\nsummary judgment on the ground that \"plaintiff’s position was\n\n                                     -13-\n\fthat of a technocrat devoid of even a modicum of policymaking or\n\nconfidential responsibilities.\"          Id. at 317.\n\n           Duriex-Gauthier's job description describes a Personnel\n\nDirector   \"with     great   technical    independence\"   who   reported\n\ndirectly to the number two person in the agency.            He was not\n\nlimited to merely making recommendations on personnel matters,\n\nbut   rather   was    also   \"responsible     for   the   planning   and\n\nsupervision of all the personnel activities.\"               His duties\n\nincluded analyzing the problems of organization and procedures\n\nand interpreting and applying the personnel laws.          Further, the\n\nduties explicitly included a liaison role with the Central\n\nOffice for the Administration of Personnel. These duties appear\n\nto fit comfortably within the second prong of the Jimenez\n\nFuentes test, and are strikingly similar to the duties of the\n\npersonnel director in the Cordero case.          867 F.2d at 11-12. In\n\nthis circuit we\n\n      have regularly upheld against First Amendment\n      challenge the dismissal on political grounds of mid-\n      or upper-level officials or employees who are\n      significantly connected to policy-making. This result\n      has followed where the plaintiff merely represented\n      the agency’s policy positions to other entities or to\n      the public or where important personnel functions were\n      part of the portfolio.\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fFlynn, 140 F.3d at 45.\n\n           This conclusion is reinforced by the description of the\n\nposition in each of plaintiff’s employment contracts as a trust\n\nposition, and by Section VI of Regulation 86, which states that\n\ntrust employees of the Ombudsman's Office are subject to free\n\nremoval.   We also note that under Puerto Rican law, personnel\n\ndirectors are often considered to be trust employees. Franco v.\n\nMunicipio de Cidra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 263 (1982) (noting that\n\nbecause mayor had delegated his statutory authority to name\n\nemployees to the personnel director, who had primary authority\n\nfor advising mayor on personnel matters, position was \"ipso\n\njure\" one of trust).     While the labels do not determine the\n\noutcome, Ortiz-Pinero, 84 F.3d at 12, the labels here coincide\n\nwith an objectively reasonable conclusion that the duties are\n\nthose of a position exempt from the Branti/Rutan rule.\n\n           Duriex-Gauthier attempts to avoid this conclusion with\n\nan argument that the very nature of the Ombudsman’s Office is\n\nnon-political and so plaintiff must be protected by the First\n\nAmendment. Plaintiff stresses that the Ombudsman is not part of\n\nthe executive branch but of the legislative branch, and that the\n\nOmbudsman is appointed for a six-year term deliberately to\n\n                               -15-\n\fremove him from the four-year electoral cycle.5              Our precedent\n\nhas not been restricted to the executive branch. This court has\n\nroutinely applied Branti to public agencies, such as the Puerto\n\nRico Highway Authority, and has found certain top level jobs to\n\nbe excluded.        Zayas-Rodriguez, 830 F.2d at 304.        The ultimate\n\nquestion is whether the position is one in which political\n\naffiliation is a reasonably necessary requirement; if so the\n\nposition is an exception to the Branti/Rutan standard.                  That\n\nquestion rarely permits a categorical answer and nothing in the\n\nSupreme Court caselaw limits the positions for which political\n\naffiliation is appropriate to the executive branch.              Moreover,\n\nthe Ombudsman is attached by law to the legislative branch, the\n\nbranch    in   which   partisan   political    concerns   are    at   their\n\nstrongest.      The Ombudsman is appointed by the governor and must\n\nbe approved by a majority of all members of the legislative\n\nbranch.      2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 704.          Although the Ombudsman's\n\nappointment may reflect a compromise between political parties,\n\nat   least     in   instances   where   opposing   parties    control   the\n\n\n     5     Plaintiff stated in his brief that the Ombudsman is appointed\nto a ten-year term. However, the Ombudsman, according to the statute,\nis appointed to a six-year term. 2 P.R. Laws Ann. § 704. The mistake\nis irrelevant to our analysis.\n\n                                    -16-\n\fexecutive and the legislature, we think it clear that the\n\noverall   functions   of    the    Ombudsman    “involve     government\n\ndecisionmaking on issues where there is room for political\n\ndisagreement   on   goals   or    their   implementation,”     Jimenez\n\nFuentes, 807 F.2d at    241-42, such as decisions about which\n\ninvestigations to undertake and on which issues to focus.\n\nPlaintiff was hired by a PDP Director and fired by a NPP\n\nDirector, each of whom may have taken different approaches to\n\nthe Ombudsman's duties based on party affiliation.\n\n\n\n\n2.   Application of Qualified Immunity Standard\n\n          Even had we not addressed whether plaintiff's position\n\nwas a protected position, immunity should have been granted.\n\nWhile the district court could have granted immunity on the\n\nbasis that it was clear that the position was one for which\n\nparty affiliation was appropriate, it could not deny immunity on\n\nthe basis that in its view the position was not.           That ruling\n\ndoes not dispose of immunity but simply brings the court to the\n\ndispositive question:   whether an objectively reasonable person\n\nin Lopez-Nieves's position could conclude that Duriex-Gauthier's\n\n                                  -17-\n\fposition \"'potentially' concerned matters of partisan political\n\ninterest     and    involved       a      'modicum'      of    policy-making\n\nresponsibility, access to confidential information, or official\n\ncommunication.\"     Zayas-Rodriguez, 830 F.2d at 2.             The answer to\n\nthe appropriate question leads to the conclusion that Lopez-\n\nNieves was entitled to immunity.\n\n            In previous cases, we have granted immunity partially\n\nbecause a defendant might reasonably rely, even if mistakenly\n\nso, on the position’s status as “confidential or trust” under\n\nthe Puerto Rico Public Service Act. See Roldan-Plumey, 115 F.3d\n\nat 65.      Here, we think an objectively reasonable person in\n\ndefendant’s position could conclude both that Duriex-Gauthier’s\n\nposition as Personnel Director was not a protected position,\n\nparticularly in light of our previous decisions holding that\n\npersonnel directors were not protected, of Duriex-Gauthier's\n\ncontract and job description, and of Regulation 86, which\n\nindicated that his position was one of free removal.\n\nB.   Qualified Immunity on Due Process Claim\n\n            On the due process claim, the only issue before us is\n\nwhether    defendant      is   entitled       to   qualified   immunity,   and\n\ntherefore    the   only    question      we    need   answer   is   whether   a\n\n                                       -18-\n\freasonable person in Lopez-Nieves's position would have thought\n\nthat firing Duriex-Gauthier violated his due process rights.\n\nThe due process claim turns on whether Duriex-Gauthier had a\n\nproperty interest in his job, which is a question of Puerto\n\nRican law.   See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538 (1985).   There is no strong federal concern to provide\n\nguidance as to the primary conduct of Puerto Rican government\n\nofficials here.    Plaintiff’s theory is that he was neither a\n\nconfidence nor a trust employee under state law, but was an\n\nemployee entitled to “tenure” under Section VXIII of Regulation\n\n86 and so had a property interest in his job.        If he did have\n\nsuch an interest, he could not be deprived of it without due\n\nprocess of law.\n\n          It is unclear to us whether the process he claims is\n\ndue is that set forth in Regulation 86 or in the Personnel Law.6\n\nThe tensions between Sections XVIII and Section V of Regulation\n\n86 may create some ambiguity as to whether Ombudsman's Office\n\n\n     6     The existence of these processes raises a question of the\nnature of plaintiff’s due process claim, if any, and the nature of any\nrelief available in light of the Parratt-Hudson doctrine.

Alcalde del\n\nMunicipio de Ceiba, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Dec.</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 747 (1982). Lopez-Nieves\n\nhas produced an unrebutted affidavit to the effect that Duriex-\n\nGauthier was not so recruited and therefore it appears that the\n\nplaintiff has no property right under the Personnel Act.       Thus,\n\nwe cannot say a reasonable director could not objectively\n\nconclude there was no property interest involved.\n\n\n\n                               III.\n\n         Accordingly, we reverse the district court, and remand\n\nwith directions that defendant be granted qualified immunity as\n\n                               -20-\n\fto all claims, that the First Amendment claim be dismissed, and\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion on the\n\nplaintiff's claim for injunctive relief on the alleged due\n\nprocess violation.\n\n\n\n\n                             -21-\n\f</pre>",
