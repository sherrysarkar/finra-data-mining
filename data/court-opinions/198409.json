The National Labor\r\nRelations Board (NLRB or Board) petitioned this court for\r\nenforcement of its final order against Beverly Enterprises-\r\nMassachusetts, Inc. (Beverly).  See 325 NLRB No. 95 (April 9,\r\n1998).  Beverly challenges the Board's order both procedurally and\r\nsubstantively. \r\nProcedurally, the Board incorporated the Administrative\r\nLaw Judge's (ALJ's) oral bench decision, which was made without\r\naffording Beverly an opportunity to submit written briefs.  Beverly\r\ncontends that this procedure, permitted under a recent Board\r\nregulation, 29 C.F.R.  102.42, violates Section 10(c) of the\r\nNational Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act), 29 U.S.C.  160(c). \r\nFor this reason, Beverly argues that the regulation is unlawful,\r\narbitrary and capricious.  In any event, Beverly contends that the\r\nALJ's procedure failed to comply with the regulation.  On this\r\nquestion of first impression in this circuit, we reject Beverly's\r\nprocedural claims and uphold the regulation.\r\nSubstantively, Beverly asserts that the record as a whole\r\ndoes not contain substantial evidence supporting the Board's\r\nfinding that Beverly violated Sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act,\r\n29 U.S.C.  158(a)(1) and (5), by unilaterally reducing the\r\nmaximum 1996 wage increase from four percent to three percent, by\r\nunlawfully withdrawing recognition from the union representing its\r\nemployees, and by unilaterally imposing a fee for lost timecards. \r\nWe conclude that there is such substantial evidence, and enforce\r\nthe Board's order.\r\nI.                          Background\r\n                       A.  Facts\r\nThe Board found the following facts.  Beverly operates a\r\nnursing home in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  Historically, Beverly had\r\ngiven its employees annual wage increases on the anniversaries of\r\ntheir respective starting dates with the company.  At least as\r\nearly as 1990, Beverly had fixed the maximum wage increase at four\r\npercent, and it awarded that amount to approximately ninety percent\r\nof its employees.\r\nOn March 23, 1993, the NLRB certified the Hospital\r\nWorkers Union, Local 767, Service Employees International Union\r\n(the union), as the exclusive bargaining representative of all\r\nfull-time and part-time service and maintenance employees at\r\nBeverly's Plymouth facility.  \r\nBeginning in June 1993, the union and the company engaged\r\nin contract negotiations.  The parties disagreed as to the amount\r\nof wage increases the employees would receive.  In October 1994,\r\nthe union told the company that it would be difficult to persuade\r\nits unit members to accept an annual increase of less than four\r\npercent.  Later in 1994, the union negotiator indicated that the\r\ncompany would have to come up from its three percent figure if the\r\nparties were to reach agreement.  At the parties' final negotiating\r\nsession, on December 13, 1995, Beverly responded to the union's\r\nearlier proposal of four percent by proposing a two percent annual\r\nwage increase.  The union expressed shock at the newly lowered\r\noffer and did not immediately make a counteroffer.  The parties\r\nwent on to discuss an unrelated dispute (whether certain employees\r\nwere part of the bargaining unit) and tempers flared.  The union\r\nspokesperson stated that he needed to check with his attorney on\r\nthe bargaining unit issue, that he would call the company\r\nrepresentative, but that the latter \"shouldn't hold [his] breath.\"\r\nWhile these negotiations were taking place, Beverly\r\ncontinued to provide its employees with wage increases on their\r\nemployment anniversaries, and continued to award a maximum wage\r\nincrease of four percent to the overwhelming majority of them. \r\nThis practice changed in 1996, however.  That year, the company\r\ngave to approximately ninety percent of the company's unit\r\nemployees a maximum wage increase of three percent.  Beverly did\r\nnot provide notice to the union that it would lower the maximum\r\nwage increase from four percent to three percent, nor did Beverly\r\nbargain with the union over the issue.  Instead, Beverly\r\nunilaterally announced the change to the union in a letter, dated\r\nMarch 14, 1996.  The letter described the imposition of the three\r\npercent maximum wage increase as a \"compromise\" between the\r\nparties' negotiating positions.\r\nIn approximately January 1996, Beverly changed its system\r\nof keeping track of its employees' work time.  It replaced its\r\nsystem of paper timecards with a system using plastic timecards\r\nthat contained a magnetic strip.  Included in its new system was a\r\nnew policy requiring unit employees to pay a five-dollar fee for\r\nlost timecards.  In making these changes, Beverly neither gave\r\nnotice to nor bargained with the union.  As of the date of the NLRB\r\nhearing on April 15, 1997, the company had collected the five-\r\ndollar lost-timecard fee on at least seventeen occasions.\r\nBetween January and June 1996, the union contacted\r\nBeverly on several occasions and requested that it remedy its\r\nunilateral changes and that the parties resume bargaining.  In its\r\nletters, the union preconditioned further negotiations on Beverly's\r\nremedying an unrelated alleged unfair labor practice.\r\nOn June 1, 1996, the union's chief negotiator and a group\r\nof union members committed a trespass at Beverly's facility while\r\nostensibly handbilling Beverly's employees.  On June 17, 1996, the\r\nunion again wrote Beverly offering to bargain if the latter\r\nrectified all outstanding conduct which the union perceived to be\r\nviolative of the Act.  On June 25, 1996, Beverly unilaterally\r\nwithdrew recognition of the union.\r\n            B.  Board Conclusions and Order\r\nThe union filed unfair labor practice charges (ULP) with\r\nthe NLRB.  A hearing was held before a Board ALJ, who found the\r\nforegoing facts and concluded that Beverly violated Sections\r\n8(a)(1) and (5) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C.  158(a)(1) and (5) (1994),\r\nin two separate respects:  by unilaterally reducing the maximum\r\n1996 wage increase from four percent to three percent, and by\r\nunilaterally imposing a new fee for lost timecards.  The ALJ also\r\nfound that the company violated the same statutory provisions by\r\nunlawfully withdrawing recognition of the union as the exclusive\r\nbargaining representative of Beverly's service and maintenance\r\nemployees.  Based upon its findings of fact, the Board adopted both\r\nthe findings and the recommended decision of its ALJ.\r\nAs recommended by the ALJ, the Board ordered Beverly to\r\ncease and desist from its unfair labor practices and from otherwise\r\ninterfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the\r\nexercise of their rights under Section 7 of the NLRA. \r\nAffirmatively, the Board ordered the company immediately to put\r\ninto effect the annual four percent wage increases that were\r\ncustomary prior to January 1, 1996, and to continue such increases\r\nin effect until the company negotiated a collective bargaining\r\nagreement (CBA) with the union or reached an impasse after\r\nbargaining in good faith.  The order also required the company to\r\nmake whole unit employees for any loss of pay they had suffered due\r\nto Beverly's unilateral reduction of the maximum wage increase.\r\nThe order further required Beverly to eliminate the five-\r\ndollar fee charged to employees for lost timecards until it\r\nnegotiated a CBA with the union or reached an impasse after\r\nbargaining in good faith.  It required the company to make whole\r\nits unit employees for any losses caused by the imposition of the\r\nfive-dollar fee.  Finally, the order required Beverly to bargain\r\nwith the union upon request, to embody any understanding reached in\r\na written agreement, and to post an appropriate notice.\r\nII.                     Standard of Review\r\nThe applicable standard of review for NLRB action is\r\nprovided by the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C.  160(e)\r\n(1994), and, by default, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5\r\nU.S.C.  706 (1994).  These statutes require us to apply different\r\nstandards of review depending upon what type of determination we\r\nare reviewing. \r\n            A.  The Board's Factual Findings\r\nThe Board's findings of fact are conclusive if supported\r\nby substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.  29\r\nU.S.C.  160(e); Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., 340 U.S. 474,\r\n488 (1951).  Substantial evidence is \"such relevant evidence as a\r\nreasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" \r\nUniversal Camera, 340 U.S. at 477 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted), quoted in American Textile Mfrs. Inst. v. Donovan, 452\r\nU.S. 490, 522 (1981) (ATMI); see also F.T.C. v. Indiana Fed'n of\r\nDentists, 476 U.S. 447, 454 (1986).  The reviewing court must\r\nconsider \"the record in its entirety . . ., including the body of\r\nevidence opposed to the Board's view.\"  Universal Camera, 340 U.S.\r\nat 487-88; see Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. F.A.A., 164 F.3d 713,\r\n718 (1st Cir. 1999).  But \"the possibility of drawing two\r\ninconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an\r\nadministrative agency's finding from being supported by substantial\r\nevidence.\"  ATMI, 452 U.S. at 523 (internal quotation marks\r\nomitted).\r\nIn Allentown Mack Sales &amp; Serv., Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 118 S.\r\nCt. 818, 823 (1998), the Court equated the substantial evidence\r\nstandard with \"whether on this record it would have been possible\r\nfor a reasonable jury to reach the [agency's] conclusion.\"  The\r\n\"substantial evidence\" test \"gives the agency the benefit of the\r\ndoubt, since it requires not the degree of evidence which satisfies\r\nthe court that the requisite fact exists, but merely the degree\r\nthat could satisfy a reasonable factfinder.\"  Id. at 828.  This is\r\nan \"objective test,\" id., so, for example, when the agency\r\n\"purports to be engaged in simple factfinding, . . . it is not free\r\nto prescribe what inferences from the evidence it will accept and\r\nreject, but must draw all those inferences that the evidence fairly\r\ndemands,\" id. at 829; see Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476 U.S. at\r\n454.  The agency's findings \"must . . . be set aside when the\r\nrecord before a Court of Appeals clearly precludes the Board's\r\ndecision from being justified by a fair estimate of the worth of\r\nthe testimony of witnesses or its informed judgment on matters\r\nwithin its special competence or both.\"  Universal Camera, 340 U.S.\r\nat 490.  \r\n       B.  The Board's Decisions on Legal Issues.\r\nBecause the NLRA is silent as to the standard for\r\nreviewing nonfactual matters, the standard of review for such\r\nmatters is provided by section 10(e) of the Administrative\r\nProcedure Act.  Errors of law are reviewed by the court de novo. \r\nSee 5 U.S.C.  706 (\"[T]he reviewing court shall decide all\r\nrelevant questions of law.\"); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and\r\nFirearms v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., 464 U.S. 89, 97 n.7\r\n(1983); Penobscot, 164 F.3d at 718.  \"The legal issues presented  \r\nthat is, the identification of governing legal standards and their\r\napplication to the facts found   are, by contrast [to factual\r\nfindings], for the courts to resolve, although even in considering\r\nsuch issues the courts are to give some deference to the [agency's]\r\ninformed judgment\" in applying statutory terms if the statute is\r\nsilent or ambiguous on the issue.  Indiana Fed'n of Dentists, 476\r\nU.S. at 454.\r\nThat deference is described in the familiar two-step test\r\nof Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,\r\n467 U.S. 837, 842-44 (1984), which applies to the NLRB as to other\r\nagencies.  \"On a pure question of statutory construction, our first\r\njob is to try to determine congressional intent, using 'traditional\r\ntools of statutory construction.'  If we can do so, then that\r\ninterpretation must be given effect, and [agency regulations] must\r\nbe fully consistent with it.\"  N.L.R.B. v. United Food &amp; Commercial\r\nWorkers' Union, Local 23, 484 U.S. 112, 123 (1987) (UFCW) (emphasis\r\nadded) (quoting I.N.S. v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 446-48\r\n(1987)).  Thus, if the legislative intent is clear, we do not defer\r\nto the agency and we end the Chevron analysis at step one.  SeeChevron, 467 U.S. at 843; Penobscot, 164 F.3d at 719.\r\nWe reach the second step of Chevron if \"the statute is\r\nsilent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue\"; then \"the\r\nquestion for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on\r\na permissible construction of the statute.\"  UFCW, 484 U.S. at 123\r\n(quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843).  \"Under this principle, we have\r\ntraditionally accorded the Board deference with regard to its\r\ninterpretation of the NLRA as long as its interpretation is\r\nrational and consistent with the statute.\"  Id.; see also Auciello\r\nIron Works, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., 517 U.S. 781, 787-88 (1996) (noting\r\n\"the 'considerable deference' that the Board is due by virtue of\r\nits charge to develop national labor policy, through interstitial\r\nrulemaking that is 'rational and consistent with the Act'\" (quoting\r\nN.L.R.B. v. Curtin Matheson Scientific, Inc., 494 U.S. 775, 786-87\r\n(1990)).\r\nEven where such deference is due, the agency's\r\n\"explication\" of its reasoning cannot be \"inadequate, irrational or\r\narbitrary.\"  Allentown Mack, 118 S. Ct. at 822 (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted); see id. at 826 (The APA \"establishes a scheme of\r\nreasoned decisionmaking,\" under which \"[n]ot only must an agency's\r\ndecreed result be within the scope of its lawful authority, but the\r\nprocess by which it reaches that result must be logical and\r\nrational.\"  (Internal quotation marks omitted)); Bureau of Alcohol,\r\nTobacco and Firearms, 464 U.S. at 97 (explaining that reviewing\r\ncourt \"must not rubber-stamp . . . administrative decisions\"). \r\n\"The reviewing court remains the final authority on issues of\r\nstatutory construction.\"  Penobscot, 164 F.3d at 719 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted); see 5 U.S.C.  706(2)(A).\r\nC.  Review of the Board's Other Action and Conclusions\r\nWith respect to other agency action, findings, and\r\nconclusions, the APA requires the reviewing court to hold them\r\nunlawful and set them aside if they are found to be \"arbitrary,\r\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance\r\nwith law.\"  5 U.S.C.  706(2)(A).  Certain agency rules are among\r\nthe agency actions that may be subjected to the \"arbitrary or\r\ncapricious\" standard.  See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n v. State Farm\r\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983) (setting aside an agency\r\nrule as \"arbitrary and capricious\" where agency failed to consider\r\na viable alternative to rescinding its rule, and where agency's\r\nreasoning was inadequate in light of the data before it); Kenneth\r\nCulp Davis &amp; Richard J. Pierce, Jr., 1 Administrative Law Treatise 7.4 (3d ed. 1994).\r\nThe task of a court reviewing agency action under the\r\nAPA's \"arbitrary or capricious\" standard is to determine whether\r\nthe agency has examined the pertinent evidence, considered the\r\nrelevant factors, and \"articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for\r\nits action including a 'rational connection between the facts found\r\nand the choice made.'\"  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43  (quoting\r\nBurlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168\r\n(1962)); see Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v. Natural Resources Defense\r\nCouncil, Inc., 462 U.S. 87, 105 (1983) (citations omitted).  \r\nThe reviewing court must \"look to see if the agency\r\ndecision, in the context of the record, is too unreasonable (given\r\nits statutory and factual context) for the law to permit it to\r\nstand.\"  Sierra Club v. Marsh, 976 F.2d 763, 769 (1st Cir. 1992)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). \r\nIn State Farm, the Supreme Court offered several examples\r\nof circumstances in which an agency action \"normally\" would be\r\nconsidered arbitrary and capricious:  situations where \"the agency\r\nhas relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to\r\nconsider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the\r\nproblem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter\r\nto the evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it\r\ncould not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of\r\nagency expertise.\"  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  \"These are merely\r\n'examples,' Puerto Rico Sun Oil Co. v. United States E.P.A., 8 F.3d\r\n73, 77 (1st Cir. 1993); others could be recited as well.\"  Duboisv. United States Dep't of Agric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1285 (1st Cir.\r\n1996).  \"The reviewing court should not attempt itself to make up\r\nfor such deficiencies; we may not supply a reasoned basis for the\r\nagency's action that the agency itself has not given.\"  State Farm,\r\n463 U.S. at 43 (citing S.E.C. v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196\r\n(1947)).\r\n\"While this is a highly deferential standard of review,\r\nit is not a rubber stamp.\"  Penobscot, 164 F.3d at 720 (quoting\r\nDubois, 102 F.3d at 1285).  Although \"the ultimate standard of\r\nreview is a narrow one,\" the court must undertake \"a thorough,\r\nprobing, in-depth review\" and a \"searching and careful\" inquiry\r\ninto the record.  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,\r\n401 U.S. 402, 415-16 (1971).  In order for an agency decision to\r\npass muster under the APA's \"arbitrary and capricious\" test, the\r\nreviewing court must determine that the decision is \"rational,\"\r\nCitizens Awareness Network, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm'n,\r\n59 F.3d 284, 290 (1st Cir. 1995), that it \"make[s] . . . sense,\"\r\nPuerto Rico Sun Oil, 8 F.3d at 77.  Only by \"carefully reviewing\r\nthe record and satisfying [itself] that the agency has made a\r\nreasoned decision\" can the court \"ensure that agency decisions are\r\nfounded on a reasoned evaluation of the relevant factors.\"  Marshv. Oregon Natural Resources Council, 490 U.S. 360, 378 (1989)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n                    III.  Discussion\r\n                 A.  General Principles\r\nAn employer's duty to bargain with its employees' chosen\r\nrepresentatives is an essential element of our national labor\r\npolicy.  \"The object of [the NLRA] was . . . to insure that\r\nemployers and their employees could work together to establish\r\nmutually satisfactory conditions [of employment].  The basic theme\r\nof the Act was that through collective bargaining the passions,\r\narguments, and struggles of prior years would be channeled into\r\nconstructive, open discussions leading, it was hoped, to mutual\r\nagreement.\"  Ford Motor Co. v. N.L.R.B., 441 U.S. 488, 498 (1979)\r\n(quoting H.K. Porter Co. v. N.L.R.B., 397 U.S. 99, 103 (1970)); seeid. at 502 n.14 (explaining benefits of collective bargaining);\r\nAuciello Iron Works, 517 U.S. at 785.  The duty to bargain is part\r\nand parcel of that policy's preference for resolving labor disputes\r\npeacefully, through good faith collective bargaining, rather than\r\nby means of industrial strife which has a destructive effect on the\r\neconomy.  See United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf\r\nNavigation Co., 363 U.S. 574, 578 (1960) (describing federal labor\r\npolicy as \"to promote industrial stabilization through the\r\ncollective bargaining agreement\"); Textile Workers v. Lincoln\r\nMills, 353 U.S. 448, 453-55 (1957) (In passing the NLRA, Congress's\r\npurpose was to encourage collective bargaining and thereby promote\r\n\"industrial peace.\"); N.L.R.B. v. Lion Oil Co., 352 U.S. 282, 289\r\n(1957) (The Court has \"recognized a dual purpose in the Taft-\r\nHartley Act   to substitute collective bargaining for economic\r\nwarfare and to protect the right of employees to engage in\r\nconcerted activities for their own benefit.\" (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted)).\r\nBecause of these policy considerations, Section 8(a)(5)\r\nof the NLRA, as amplified by Section 8(d), requires an employer to\r\nbargain collectively with its employees' representatives over\r\n\"wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment.\"  29\r\nU.S.C.  158(a)(5), 158(d).  Section 8(a)(5) makes it an unfair\r\nlabor practice for an employer \"to refuse to bargain collectively\r\nwith the representatives of [its] employees . . . .\"  29 U.S.C.\r\n158(a)(5).  That section is also violated if an employer\r\nunilaterally changes any term or condition of employment without\r\naffording the union representing its employees a meaningful\r\nopportunity to negotiate \"in fact.\"  N.L.R.B. v. Katz, 369 U.S.\r\n736, 743 (1962); see 29 U.S.C.  158(a)(5).  In addition, \"it is\r\ngenerally unlawful for an employer to withdraw recognition of the\r\nunion as a means of refusing to bargain.\"  Bolton-Emerson, Inc. v.\r\nN.L.R.B., 899 F.2d 104, 106 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n           B.  The Anniversary Wage Increases\r\nA pay system in which the employer does not exercise\r\ndiscretion in the timing or the amount of the wage increase awarded\r\nis a mandatory subject of bargaining.  See Daily News of Los\r\nAngeles, 315 NLRB 1236, 1239 (1994), enforced, 73 F.3d 406 (D.C.\r\nCir. 1996); Central Maine Morning Sentinel, 295 NLRB 376, 378-79\r\n(1989) (\"[T]he exercise of some discretion is not fatal to the\r\nconclusion that the raise was a condition of employment.\");\r\nSoutheastern Michigan Gas Co., 198 NLRB 1221, 1222-23 (1972),\r\nenforced, 485 F.2d 1239 (6th Cir. 1973).  This means, with respect\r\nto the anniversary wage increases, that an employer cannot\r\nunilaterally change the status quo, as Beverly did here, without\r\nbargaining with the union.  Even during negotiations, an employer\r\nmust maintain the \"dynamic status quo\" pertaining to employees'\r\nwages.  Eastern Maine Med. Ctr. v. N.L.R.B., 658 F.2d 1, 8 (1st\r\nCir. 1981) (In light of longstanding practice of regular wage\r\nincreases to keep up with inflation and community wage patterns as\r\nreflected in periodic wage surveys, an \"[i]ndefiniteness as to\r\namount and a flavor of discretion do not . . . prevent the\r\nundertaking from becoming part of the conditions of employment.\"). \r\nThus, \"[a]n employer with a past history of a merit increase\r\nprogram [may not] discontinue that program . . . once an exclusive\r\nbargaining agent is selected.\"  Oneita Knitting Mills, 205 NLRB\r\n500, 500 n.1 (1973).  Therefore, by unilaterally changing the\r\namount of a fixed wage increase without bargaining with the\r\ncertified representative of its employees, an employer violates\r\nSection 8(a)(5) of the Act.  See Daily News of Los Angeles, 315\r\nNLRB at 1239; Southeastern Michigan Gas Co., 198 NLRB at 1222-23. \r\nIn a case with facts very similar to those here, the NLRB held that\r\nan employer's unilateral revocation of a company policy granting\r\nannual wage increases to keep pace with the wages of its main\r\ncompetitor violated the Act.  See UARCO, Inc., 283 NLRB 298, 299-\r\n301 (1987).\r\nBased on the record before it, the Board found that, in\r\nimplementing a three percent maximum wage increase in 1996, Beverly\r\nmade a unilateral change to the terms and conditions of employment,\r\nin violation of the Act.  Beverly does not dispute that, between\r\n1990 and 1995, Beverly gave its employees a four percent maximum\r\nwage increase on the anniversaries of their respective dates of\r\nemployment.  Substantial evidence supports the Board's factual\r\nfinding that, in 1996, without reaching agreement with the union or\r\nreaching impasse, Beverly gave its employees a maximum wage\r\nincrease of three percent.  The Board concluded that the company's\r\nsystem of annual wage increases was a mandatory subject of\r\ncollective bargaining, and therefore that the company, by\r\nunilaterally changing the maximum wage increase awarded, violated\r\nSection 8(a)(5) of the Act.\r\nOn this issue as on others, the Board's construction of\r\nthe Act should be upheld if it is \"reasonably defensible.\"  Ford\r\nMotor Co., 441 U.S. at 497.  Particularly with respect to\r\ndeterminations that fall within the Board's \"special expertise,\"\r\nsuch as whether an issue is a mandatory subject of bargaining, the\r\nBoard is entitled to \"considerable deference.\"  Id. at 495; seeAuciello Iron Works, 517 U.S. at 787-88; Daily News of Los Angelesv. N.L.R.B., 73 F.3d 406, 410-11 (D.C., Cir. 1996) (holding that\r\nmerit-increase program is a mandatory subject of bargaining).  Such\r\nis the case here, with respect to the Board's determination.\r\nIt does not take much deference to agree that proposed\r\nchanges to the company's system of annual wage increases   in this\r\ncase, the maximum increase the company will allow   is a mandatory\r\nsubject of collective bargaining.  It is also easy to agree that\r\nunilateral changes to that system violate Section 8(a)(5).  It is\r\nimportant to our national labor policy that companies not act\r\nunilaterally on subjects of mandatory bargaining; doing so defeats\r\nthe whole purpose of that policy's preference for peaceful\r\nnegotiation of disputes rather than industrial strife.  See \r\nWarrior &amp; Gulf, 363 U.S. at 578; Lion Oil Co., 352 U.S. at 289.\r\nBeverly argues that the three percent wage increase in\r\n1996 was not in fact a unilateral change, indeed was not a change\r\nat all, but was based on the same formula it had applied in the\r\npast when it granted a four percent maximum wage increase. \r\nBeverly's witnesses testified that company officials determined the\r\n1996 maximum wage increase exclusively by applying the same\r\n\"established formula\" that the company had used in the past to\r\nreach the four percent increase.\r\nBeverly asserts that the ALJ's decision failed to discuss\r\nthis uncontradicted testimony.  But Beverly incorrectly concludes\r\nthat this means the ALJ \"failed to consider\" Beverly's testimony. \r\nAn ALJ can consider all the evidence without directly addressing in\r\nhis written decision every piece of evidence submitted by a party. \r\nNor must an ALJ make \"explicit credibility findings\" as to each bit\r\nof conflicting testimony, so long as his factual findings as a\r\nwhole show that he \"implicitly resolve[d]\" such conflicts. \r\nN.L.R.B. v. Berger Transfer &amp; Storage Co., 678 F.2d 679, 687 (7th\r\nCir. 1982); see N.L.R.B. v. Katz's Delicatessen of Houston St.,\r\nInc., 80 F.3d 755, 765 (2d Cir. 1996) (An ALJ may resolve\r\ncredibility disputes implicitly rather than explicitly where his\r\n\"treatment of the evidence is supported by the record as a\r\nwhole.\").\r\nHere, the Board \"explicitly reject[ed] Beverly's factual\r\ncontention that the 3 percent maximum increase was the result of\r\nits consistent application of an inflexible formula.\"  Instead, the\r\nBoard placed great weight on the company's March 14, 1996 letter,\r\nin which Beverly indicated that the three percent maximum wage\r\nincrease for 1996 was a \"compromise between the [Company's]\r\nproposals for 2% anniversary merit increases and the Union's\r\nproposals for 4% anniversary merit increases.\"  Even in the face of\r\nthis admission, Beverly would have the Board accept at face value\r\nthe self-serving representations of Beverly's Human Resources\r\nDirector, Jay Begley, that, by some extraordinary coincidence,\r\nBeverly's application of its pre-existing formula for calculating\r\nwage increases resulted in the same 3% increase reflected in the\r\n\"compromise\" position.  The Board reasonably found that the\r\ncontemporaneous letter was a \"direct explanation\" of the company's\r\ndecision to reduce the maximum wage increase from four to three\r\npercent, and \"as such constitutes an admission that the 1996\r\nmaximum wage increases were not tied to any prior formula used\" in\r\npast years by the company.  Substantial evidence supports this\r\nconclusion.\r\nBeverly argues, in the alternative, that, even if the\r\nthree percent wage increase did constitute a unilateral change, it\r\ndid not violate the NLRA because the parties were at impasse and\r\nthe union \"had taken an intractable position.\"  The Board properly\r\nrejected this contention as well.\r\nBefore an employer may undertake any unilateral changes,\r\n\"[t]here is a strong requirement that impasse be clear . . . in\r\norder to insure the integrity of the bargaining process.\"  Bolton-\r\nEmerson, 899 F.2d at 108.  This is particularly important because,\r\nas noted, our national labor policy prefers peaceful collective\r\nbargaining rather than destructive industrial strife.  \"Impasse\r\noccurs when, after good faith bargaining, the parties are\r\ndeadlocked so that any further bargaining would be futile,\" id.,\r\ni.e., when \"there [is] no realistic prospect that continuation of\r\ndiscussions at that time would . . . [be] fruitful,\" Teamsters\r\nLocal Union No. 639 v. N.L.R.B., 924 F.2d 1078, 1083 (D.C. Cir.\r\n1991) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). \r\nThe law is clear that employer and union representatives must fully\r\npursue bargaining in good faith; they cannot hide behind zealous or\r\neven passionate advocacy on the part of their adversaries to short-\r\ncircuit the collective bargaining process by claiming that the\r\ndisfavored point of impasse has been reached.  See N.L.R.B. v.\r\nPowell Elec. Mfg. Co., 906 F.2d 1007, 1011-12 (5th Cir. 1990)\r\n(stating that small number of substantive bargaining sessions\r\nweighs strongly against existence of impasse); Teamsters Local\r\nUnion No. 639, 924 F.2d at 1083-84 (holding that brevity of\r\nparties' negotiations on issue and union's position that it still\r\n\"had more movement to make\" undermine employer's declaration of\r\nimpasse); N.L.R.B. v.

N.L.R.B., 719 F.2d 683, 688 (3d\r\nCir. 1983)).  Moreover, \"few issues are less suited to appellate\r\njudicial appraisal than evaluation of bargaining processes or\r\nbetter suited to the expert experience of a Board [that] deals\r\nconstantly with such problems.\"  Id.  Substantial evidence supports\r\nthe Board's finding here that the parties had not reached impasse\r\non the question of wage increases.  \r\nAs appears from the record, the parties specifically\r\ndiscussed wages at only two bargaining sessions:  a session in\r\nOctober 1994 at which the union representative stated that it would\r\nbe difficult to persuade its unit members to accept an increase of\r\nless than four percent, and the last bargaining session on\r\nDecember 13, 1995, where Beverly's representative, Jay Begley,\r\nfirst proposed a two percent maximum wage increase, leading a union\r\nrepresentative to express shock and anger at that proposal, making\r\nno counteroffer.  At the latter session, the parties went on to\r\nargue about an unrelated dispute, tempers flared, and the union\r\nrepresentative said he had to check with his attorney about the\r\nunrelated matter, that he would call Begley but that the latter\r\n\"shouldn't hold his breath.\"  Neither party ever presented a final\r\noffer on the matter of wage increases.\r\nBeverly relies heavily on the \"hold his breath\" comment. \r\nThe company also asserts that the union \"withdrew from bargaining\r\nfor more than six months,\" that \"Beverly received no communication\r\nbeyond a few, unlawful letters from the Union after December 1995,\r\nin the wake of its Director's statement to Begley.\" \r\nComparing the instant facts   even the \"hold his breath\"\r\ncomment   to those of the precedents cited supra, we have no\r\ndifficulty upholding the Board's finding that the evidence fell far\r\nshort of establishing that the parties had reached impasse on the\r\nquestion of wages.  See WPIX, Inc., 906 F.2d at 902; Teamsters\r\nLocal Union No. 639, 924 F.2d at 1083-84; Powell Elec. Mfg. Co.,\r\n906 F.2d at 1011-12.  The \"hold his breath\" comment is similar to\r\nthe comments that were insufficient to demonstrate impasse in WPIX,\r\nInc., 906 F.2d at 902 (union's comments dismissing employer's\r\nproposals as \"ridiculous\" and a \"slap in the face\").\r\nNor does Beverly get any mileage from the union\r\nrepresentative's statement that \"it would be very difficult for the\r\nUnion to sell an increase of less than 4 percent to the unit.\"  To\r\nsay that a proposal \"would be difficult . . . to sell\" is not the\r\nsame as a rigid assertion that the union simply would not be moved\r\nfrom a four percent \"bottom line.\"  Nor does it constitute a\r\nwithdrawal from negotiations unless the company offers four\r\npercent, as Beverly asserts; on the contrary, the statement implies\r\na continuing willingness of the party to negotiate, while pointing\r\nout one area in which a lot of movement will be \"difficult.\" \r\nIndeed, the record contains evidence that the union continued to\r\nnegotiate, and stated a willingness to continue to negotiate, on a\r\nnumber of occasions after the statement relied upon by Beverly,\r\nincluding several requests, subsequent to the December 1995\r\nbargaining session, that the parties resume negotiations.  SeeTeamsters, 924 F.2d at 1083-84.\r\nMoreover, as discussed infra, Beverly's characterization\r\nof the union's subsequent actions as a withdrawal from bargaining\r\nis flawed.  Whether or not Beverly liked the union's letters   \r\nindeed, whether or not the letters contained some proposals that\r\nwere inappropriate (such as tying the irrelevant issue of an\r\nenlarged bargaining unit to the current negotiations)   the union\r\nmade it clear in its letters that it desired to continue the\r\ncollective bargaining process.  The parties were a long way from\r\nimpasse, as the Board and the courts have defined it through their\r\nprecedents.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, substantial evidence supports\r\nthe Board's finding that Beverly's reduction of the maximum wage\r\nincrease was a unilateral change in the terms and conditions of\r\nemployment, imposed when the parties were not at impasse, and we\r\nmust uphold the Board's finding that Beverly violated Sections\r\n8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act by unilaterally reducing the maximum\r\nwage increase from four percent to three percent.\r\n             C.  The Fee for Lost Timecards  The second unfair labor practice found by the Board was\r\nBeverly's unilateral imposition of a five-dollar charge for lost\r\ntimecards.  The company does not dispute that it implemented a new\r\npolicy in January 1996 requiring all employees to pay a five-dollar\r\ncharge for lost timecards, nor that it undertook this new policy\r\nwithout notice to or bargaining with the union.  Beverly\r\ncharacterizes the change as a mere \"change to time-clock\r\nprocedure,\" and argues that it therefore does not rise to the level\r\nof a change in terms and conditions of employment.  \r\nBut Beverly mischaracterizes the issue:  the union did\r\nnot argue and the Board did not find that Beverly had to bargain\r\nwith the union about a purely mechanical change to its \"time-clock\r\nprocedure.\"  The Board held that the company's charging of a fee \r\nto employees for lost timecards   not the procedure that management\r\nrequired workers to follow to record their time   constituted a\r\nchange in a term or condition of employment, and therefore\r\nBeverly's unilateral change in such terms or conditions without\r\nfirst pursuing collective bargaining violated the NLRA.  SeeN.L.R.B. v. Katz, 369 U.S. at 743.  \r\nThis general principle has been upheld in many different\r\ncontexts.  See N.L.R.B. v. Maine Caterers, Inc., 732 F.2d 689, 691\r\n(1st Cir. 1984) (Breyer, J.) (upholding finding that employer\r\nviolated Act by unilaterally changing work practices, and rejecting\r\nargument that the changes were too minor to have significant\r\neffect); St. Luke's Hosp., 314 NLRB 434 (1994) (employer's\r\nunilateral change of dress code violated NLRA); Rangaire Co., 309\r\nNLRB 1043 (1992) (unilateral elimination of extra fifteen minutes\r\nof lunch break at Thanksgiving violated Act), enforced without\r\nopinion, 9 F.3d 104 (5th Cir. 1993); Martin Marietta Energy Sys.,\r\n283 NLRB 173 (1987) (modification of CBA by adding HMO to existing\r\nmedical coverage constituted unlawful unilateral change), enforced\r\nwithout opinion, 842 F.2d 332 (6th Cir. 1988).\r\nOne of those contexts is remarkably similar to the\r\npresent case:  in Millard Processing Servs., Inc., 310 NLRB 421,\r\n424-25 (1993), the Board held that an employer violated the NLRA by\r\nimposing a fifteen-dollar replacement fee for lost checks.  Beverly\r\nargues that its imposition of a fee for lost timecards did not\r\nviolate the Act because the action did not involve a \"material,\r\nsubstantial, and significant\" change in the terms and conditions of\r\nbargaining-unit employees.  See id.; Litton Syss., 300 NLRB 324,\r\n331 (1990), enforced, 949 F.2d 249 (8th Cir. 1991).  The Board held\r\nin Millard Processing that the imposition of a replacement fee\r\nqualifies as a \"material, substantial, and significant\" change in\r\nthe terms and conditions of employment.  310 NLRB at 424-25. \r\nMoreover, the Board's determination that the imposition of a fee\r\nfor lost timecards is a mandatory subject of bargaining is entitled\r\nto considerable deference \"because the classification of bargaining\r\nsubjects as terms or conditions of employment is a matter\r\nconcerning which the Board has special expertise.\"  Daily News of\r\nLos Angeles, 73 F.3d at 411 (quoting Ford Motor Co., 441 U.S. at\r\n495).  \r\nBeverly relies on Rust Craft Broad. of New York, Inc.,\r\n225 NLRB 327 (1976), to support its position that the company's\r\nchanging its timekeeping procedures was within its management\r\nprerogative and not a change in terms or conditions of employment\r\nthat is a mandatory subject of bargaining.  Such reliance is\r\nmisplaced.  The employer in Rust Craft simply instituted a \"change\r\nto a mechanical procedure for recording working time,\" installing\r\ntime clocks to replace its former system of requiring employees to\r\nrecord their time manually.  Id. at 327.  The company's actions did\r\nnot impose any new monetary burdens on its employees.  But\r\nBeverly's actions here did impose such burdens:  the employees had\r\nto pay five dollars for any lost timecards.\r\nBeverly also argues that the five-dollar charge simply\r\nreflected Beverly's passing along its cost to replace a card.  But\r\nhow Beverly derived its five-dollar fee is not the issue.  It may\r\nbe perfectly fair, but the problem is that the fee constitutes a\r\nchange in the terms and conditions of employment and Beverly must\r\nbargain with the union over such issues, not unilaterally impose\r\nthem (unless impasse is reached).\r\nThe only legitimate question Beverly raises is whether\r\nits unilateral change in the terms and conditions of employment is\r\n\"nominal,\" so \"insignificant\" as to be de minimis.  Put another\r\nway, is the size of the replacement fee so small that Beverly could\r\nimpose it without having to negotiate with the union at all? \r\nWe see no reason not to defer to the Board's conclusion\r\nthat the fee should have been the subject of bargaining before\r\nbeing imposed.  Although a five-dollar fee is getting close to the\r\nde minimis line, we need not decide where that line is.  Cf.Millard Processing, 310 NLRB at 424-25 (fifteen-dollar fee for\r\nreplacing lost checks).\r\nMore importantly, our national labor policy prefers\r\nemployers and employees to bargain collectively over terms and\r\nconditions of employment, rather than to take unilateral action\r\nthat can lead to industrial strife.  Under that labor policy, the\r\npresumption is in favor of a duty to bargain, and against an\r\nexception to that duty on the ground that the unilateral action is\r\nallegedly de minimis.\r\n       D.  Withdrawing Recognition from the Union\r\nBeverly also violated the NLRA by withdrawing recognition\r\nfrom the union.  There is no dispute that the company withdrew such\r\nrecognition on June 25, 1996.  Beverly argues that it was justified\r\nin doing so, based on three independent justifications.  We agree\r\nwith the Board that each of Beverly's contentions is without merit. \r\nThe same essential reasoning applies in this area as applied with\r\nthe above-described changes in terms and conditions of employment. \r\nThe NLRA favors an employer's duty to bargain collectively; the\r\npresumption is against the appropriateness of an employer's\r\nunilaterally withdrawing recognition from a certified labor\r\norganization representing its employees.\r\nBeverly points first to the union's \"unlawful invasion\"\r\nof company premises on June 1, 1996, as justification for the\r\nwithdrawal of recognition.  On that date, a group of union\r\nsupporters, including its chief negotiator, entered the nursing\r\nhome facility and attempted to handbill employees.  This arguably\r\nconstituted an unfair labor practice, as well as a trespass,\r\ntortious and/or criminal.\r\nIn extreme circumstances, the Board has withheld\r\notherwise appropriate bargaining orders.  Beverly cites two such\r\ncases, N.L.R.B. v. Union Nacional de Trabajadores, 540 F.2d 1 (1st\r\nCir. 1976), and Laura Modes, 144 NLRB 1592 (1962).  But\r\nsignificantly, in Trabajadores and Laura Modes, it was the Boardthat applied the sanction, not the employer that unilaterally\r\nwithdrew recognition of the union.  Beverly has not cited any cases\r\nin which an employer has been allowed unilaterally to withdraw\r\nrecognition of a union as a form of \"self-help\" even in response to\r\nviolent tactics.  Moreover, as we have held, even the issuance of\r\na decertification order by the Board \"is an extreme measure and\r\nshould be entered only when the Board has first demonstrated that\r\nthere are no equally effective alternative means of promoting the\r\nobjectives of the Act.\"  Union Nacional de Trabajadores, 540 F.2d\r\nat 13.\r\nThere is another reason why Beverly's withdrawal of\r\nrecognition was unjustified, in addition to the company's engaging\r\nin self-help rather than pursuing the statutorily-provided means of\r\nfiling a complaint with the Board.  The conduct in Trabajadores,\r\nLaura Modes and similar cases was far more egregious than that of\r\nthe union here:  the union \"engaged in violent misconduct so\r\naggravated as to preclude the maintenance of normal collective\r\nbargaining relationships.\"  Trabajadores, 540 F.2d at 13; see alsoLaura Modes, 144 NLRB at 1596 (finding that the union exhibited \"a\r\ntotal disinterest in enforcing its representation rights through\r\nthe peaceful legal process provided by the Act,\" and instead\r\n\"resorted to and/or encouraged the use of violent tactics to compel\r\ntheir grant\").  In Laura Modes, a union agent and eight non-\r\nemployee union members entered the employer's plant, struck a\r\nmanagement official in the face when he threatened to call the\r\npolice, and \"pushed around\" an office employee.  A few days later,\r\na union member followed an official of the employer as he left the\r\nplant and pointed him out to a group of four men, who beat him up. \r\n144 NLRB at 1594.  Similarly, in Union Nacional de Trabajadores,\r\n540 F.2d at 6-7, the Board revoked a union's certification where\r\nthe union president (1) \"brutally\" assaulted the president of the\r\nemployer in the presence of employees and (2) threatened employees\r\nwith serious bodily harm if they continued to work during a union-\r\nsponsored strike:  \"This is Union Nacional and we kill people.  So\r\nleave.\"  See also So-Lo Foods, Inc., 303 NLRB 749 (1991) (noting\r\nthat the principle of Laura Modes \"is only rarely applied to\r\ndeprive a union of representative rights,\" is limited to behavior\r\nsimilar to the \"repugnant and barbaric\" attacks in Laura Modes, and\r\neven then, the union would not be permanently barred).\r\nThe union's trespass in the instant case   with no\r\nviolence committed or threatened   did not come close to the level\r\nof egregiousness that would justify a withdrawal of recognition,\r\neven by the Board.  We cannot agree with Beverly that one incident\r\nof trespass, with no violence at all, demonstrates per se that the\r\n\"union has abandoned any interest in carrying on collective\r\nbargaining on behalf of its members through lawful means and has\r\ninstead sought to ensure their support through coercion.\"  Resp't\r\nBr. at 31.  Cf. N.L.R.B. v. Honaker Mills, 789 F.2d 262, 267 (4th\r\nCir. 1986) (\"picket line taunts and jeers\" are no defense to a\r\nrefusal to bargain); N.L.R.B. v. Triumph Curing Ctr., 571 F.2d 462,\r\n476-77 (9th Cir. 1978) (withholding of bargaining order not\r\njustified, notwithstanding \"extremes of verbal abuse and serious\r\nthreats of physical violence\" during first month of protracted\r\nstrike).  \r\nBeverly's second argument to justify its unilateral\r\nwithdrawal of recognition is that the union \"had become defunct.\" \r\nBut, as the Board found, the record does not reflect the union's\r\ninability or unwillingness to perform its representative functions. \r\nBeverly relies on one statement by one union representative to one\r\ncompany representative that the latter should not \"hold [his]\r\nbreath\" waiting for a response to the company's just-disclosed\r\nproposal of a two percent wage increase.  But that comment is not\r\na basis for withdrawing recognition.  Nor is a six-month break in\r\nnegotiations, also pointed to by Beverly.  See N.L.R.B. v. Flex\r\nPlastics, Inc., 726 F.2d 272, 275 (6th Cir. 1984) (per curiam)\r\n(rejecting argument that union \"inaction\" was legitimate basis for\r\nwithdrawal of recognition:  \"The Company had no evidence that the\r\nUnion-employee relationship was not an active one, only that the\r\nUnion-management relationship was inactive.\"); Pennex Aluminum\r\nCorp., 288 NLRB 439, 441 (1988) (more than two years since the last\r\nnegotiating session, but delay was \"explained by factors other than\r\nloss of employee support\"), enforced without opinion, 869 F.2d 590\r\n(3d Cir. 1989).\r\nBeverly's final justification for its withdrawal of\r\nrecognition is that the union \"placed unlawful conditions\" on\r\nbargaining, tying further bargaining to unrelated issues such as\r\nexpanding the bargaining unit and settling an unfair labor practice\r\ncharge that the union had filed against the company.  The union's\r\nactions may well have constituted unfair labor practices, and, if\r\nthe company had filed such complaints with the Board, it is quite\r\npossible that the Board would have so held, depending of course on\r\nthe facts found by the Board.  See Magic Chef, Inc., 288 NLRB 2, 10\r\n(1988) (holding that union may not demand, as a condition of\r\nsigning CBA, that employer agree to settle pending ULP charges). \r\nBut as the Board (through its ALJ) properly concluded, Beverly is\r\nnot permitted to withdraw recognition unilaterally \"simply because\r\nthe Union is argued to have violated [the Act] by making a\r\nconditional offer to bargain\" or otherwise.  Such issues are for\r\nthe Board to resolve; Beverly's self-help is inappropriate.\r\nWe too have previously recognized that employers are\r\nprohibited from withdrawing recognition of a union as a form of\r\n\"self-help\" against a union's unfair labor practices, because\r\n\"[t]he underlying purpose of this statute is industrial peace.\" \r\nN.L.R.B. v. U.S. Sonics Corp., 312 F.2d 610, 616 (1st Cir. 1963)\r\n(quoting Brooks v. N.L.R.B., 348 U.S. 96, 103 (1954)).  We\r\nemphasize again that self-help is to be discouraged and collective\r\nbargaining encouraged.  At most, an employer that believes that a\r\nunion has committed an unfair labor practice should pursue the\r\nneutral process of complaining to the NLRB, rather than engaging in\r\nself-help.  Self-help on the part of a union is, of course, equally\r\ndiscouraged.\r\n                          IV.\r\nThe only colorable question raised by Beverly is its\r\nargument that the ALJ's decision was procedurally defective because\r\nhe chose to dispense with briefs and issue a bench decision.\r\nThe legality of the Board's decision-making process is a\r\nsubcategory of legal issues, and will therefore be reviewed de\r\nnovo.  See 5 U.S.C.  706. \r\n            A. Legitimacy of the Regulation\r\nBeverly challenges both the Board's authority to issue\r\nthe regulation in question, citing Section 10(c) of the Act, 29\r\nU.S.C.  160(c), and the manner in which it applied the regulation\r\nin the instant case.  As to the former, Congress authorized the\r\nBoard \"to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary to\r\ncarry out the provisions of the Act.\"  29 U.S.C.  156.  This\r\nsection of the Act affords the Board \"broad rulemaking authority,\"\r\nAmerican Hosp. Ass'n v. N.L.R.B., 499 U.S. 606, 613 (1991),\r\nparticularly with respect to rules of procedure, see Vermont Yankee\r\nNuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 435\r\nU.S. 519, 543-44 (1978) (recognizing the \"very basic tenet of\r\nadministrative law that agencies should be free to fashion their\r\nown rules of procedure\").  Of course, \"however sweeping [the]\r\ndelegation of authority [to an agency], it is not unlimited\"; a\r\nreviewing court will only sustain regulations where it is\r\n\"reasonably able to conclude that the grant of authority\r\ncontemplates the regulations issued,\" Planned Parenthood Fed'n,\r\nInc. v. Heckler, 712 F.2d 650, 655 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (quoting\r\nChrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 308 (1979)); see Kent v.\r\nDulles, 357 U.S. 116, 129 (1958), and the regulations are\r\n\"permissible\" under Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.\r\nBeverly is correct that the regulation at issue here\r\nreflects a change from the Board's prior procedure, and that such\r\nrevisions may be entitled to less deference than a position\r\nconsistently held.\r\n[A]n administrative agency is not disqualified\r\nfrom changing its mind; and when it does, the\r\ncourts still sit in review of the\r\nadministrative decision and should not\r\napproach the statutory construction issue de\r\nnovo and without regard to the administrative\r\nunderstanding of the statutes.  On the other\r\nhand, the consistency of an agency's position\r\nis a factor in assessing the weight that\r\nposition is due.  As [the Court has] stated: \r\n\"An agency interpretation of a relevant\r\nprovision which conflicts with the agency's\r\nearlier interpretation is 'entitled to\r\nconsiderably less deference' than a\r\nconsistently held view.\"  INS v. Cardoza-\r\nFonseca, 480 U.S. 421, 446 n.30 (1987)\r\n(quoting Watt v. Alaska, 451 U.S. 259, 273\r\n(1981)).  How much weight should be given to\r\nthe agency's views in such a situation, and in\r\nparticular where its shifts might have\r\nresulted from intervening and possibly\r\nerroneous judicial decisions and its current\r\nposition from one of our own rulings, will\r\ndepend on the facts of individual cases.\r\n\nGood Samaritan Hosp. v. Shalala, 508 U.S. 402, 417 (1993) (some\r\ninternal citations and quotation marks omitted); see also F.E.C. v.\r\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Comm., 454 U.S. 27, 37 (1981)\r\n(observing that \"the thoroughness, validity, and consistency of an\r\nagency's reasoning are factors that bear upon the amount of\r\ndeference to be given an agency's ruling,\" but ultimately deferring\r\nto inconsistent agency position).\r\nThe rule at issue in the instant case is the following:\r\nAny party shall be entitled, upon request, to\r\na reasonable period at the close of the\r\nhearing for oral argument, which may include\r\npresentation of proposed findings and\r\nconclusions, and shall be included in the\r\nstenographic report of the hearing.  In the\r\ndiscretion of the administrative law judge,\r\nany party may, upon request made before the\r\nclose of the hearing, file a brief or proposed\r\nfindings and conclusions, or both, with the\r\nadministrative law judge, . . . .  In any case\r\nin which the administrative law judge believes\r\nthat written briefs or proposed findings of\r\nfact and conclusions may not be necessary, he\r\nor she shall notify the parties at the opening\r\nof the hearing or as soon thereafter as\r\npracticable that he or she may wish to hear\r\noral argument in lieu of briefs.\r\n\n29 C.F.R.  102.42 (1998).\r\n\nBeverly contends that this regulation cannot stand\r\nbecause the procedure contained therein violates Section 10(c) of\r\nthe Act, 29 U.S.C.  160(c).  But Section 10(c) cannot bear the\r\nweight that Beverly seeks to load upon it.  The statute does not\r\nentitle parties to an opportunity to file written briefs instead of\r\noral argument; it states that parties \"may\" file briefs \"in [the]\r\ndiscretion [of the ALJ].\"  29 U.S.C.  160(c).  The taking of\r\ntestimony is treated differently than the making of arguments at\r\nthe close of the testimony.  \"The testimony taken by [the ALJ]\r\nshall be reduced to writing and filed with the Board.  Thereafter,\r\nin its discretion, the Board upon notice may take further testimony\r\nor hear argument.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  \r\nThus, Beverly gains nothing by arguing that the\r\nregulation \"conflicts with Congressional intent as expressed in the\r\nAct\" because Section 10(c), in Beverly's words, \"unambiguously\r\nrequires the testimony taken by the ALJ to be 'reduced to\r\nwriting.'\"  Resp't Br. at 18 (first emphasis added) (quoting 29\r\nU.S.C.  160(c)).  Beverly does not contend that the ALJ failed to\r\nreduce any \"testimony\" to writing, only that Beverly was not\r\npermitted to submit a written brief instead of making an oral\r\nargument at the close of all the evidence.  \r\nIt is true, as Beverly further argues, that the statute\r\ngoes on to require, where evidence is presented to an ALJ, that the\r\nALJ \"shall issue and cause to be served on the parties to the\r\nproceeding a proposed report, together with a recommended order,\r\nwhich shall be filed with the Board.\"  Id.  But here too, there is\r\nnothing to preclude, either implicitly or explicitly, the agency\r\nfrom adopting the procedure permitted in the challenged rule: \r\nrequiring the ALJ to \"certify the accuracy of the pages of the\r\ntranscript containing the decision\" and to cause a copy of those\r\npages to be served on the parties and filed with the Board.  29\r\nC.F.R.  102.45.  In light of the deference due to the Board's\r\ninterpretation of the Act, we see no reason to disturb the Board's\r\nconclusion that \"these provisions provide for a written decision,\r\nin the form of a certified copy of the record pages containing the\r\njudge's full decision, which is served on the parties, in full\r\ncompliance with the provisions of Section 10(c) of the Act.\"  59\r\nFed. Reg. 65,942, 65,944 (Dec. 22, 1994).\r\nBeverly also claims that the Board, in adopting that\r\nregulation, overruled its long-standing precedent without supplying\r\nadequate reasons for doing so.  Resp't Br. at 19 (citing Plumbers,\r\nLocal 195 (Stone &amp; Webster), 237 NLRB 931 (1978); Plastic Film\r\nProds. Corp., 232 NLRB 722 (1977)).  Beverly argues that the Board\r\nacted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA by\r\namending its regulation, \"because [of] the Board's mystifying lack\r\nof reasoning in overruling its own precedent in order to justify\r\nthe Regulation.\"  Id.  As noted, a reviewing court must \"hold\r\nunlawful and set aside agency action\" that is \"arbitrary\" or\r\n\"capricious.\"  5 U.S.C.  706(2)(a).\r\nBeverly's inadequate-reasons contention is also without\r\nmerit, as the Board amply stated its reasons for revising the\r\nregulation.  The Board stated that it was revising the regulation\r\nin order to improve \"the role that [Board ALJs] play in\r\nfacilitating the expeditious resolution of unfair labor practice\r\nproceedings.\"  59 Fed. Reg. 46,375 (Sept. 8, 1994).  It offered\r\nthis regulation as \"part of its ongoing review of ways in which\r\nunfair labor practice proceedings can be revamped to move the cases\r\nmore expeditiously.\"  Id. at 46,376.  Further, the Board addressed\r\nthe concerns expressed in comments submitted in response to the\r\nproposed regulations:  the Board stated that the benefits provided\r\nthrough allowing ALJs to issue bench decisions would outweigh the\r\ndelays that might arise \"in the few cases where the procedure is\r\nimprovidently utilized.\"  Id. at 65,943.  Additionally, the Board\r\nexplained that it was consciously overruling the two cases relied\r\non by Beverly, because those cases were \"based on a misreading of\r\nthe requirements of Section 10(c) of the Act.\"  Id. at 65,943-44. \r\nThe Board also pointed to another intervening case where it had\r\nupheld an oral decision by a judge.  See Jumbo Produce, 294 NLRB\r\n998, 998-99 (1989) (noting that, in Plumbers, Local 195, \"the judge\r\norally granted the Respondent's motion for summary dismissal\r\nstating only that the General Counsel had failed to establish a\r\nprima facie case.  In contrast, the judge here states on the record\r\nhis reasons for finding Rivas not to be an agent of the\r\nRespondent.\"), enforced without opinion, 931 F.2d 887 (4th Cir.\r\n1991).\r\nWe therefore have no difficulty upholding this procedural\r\nregulation:  it is within the Board's authority and permissible\r\nunder the Act.  The Board considered relevant precedent, discussed\r\nthe objections raised through the comments submitted, and clearly\r\narticulated its reasoning in revising the regulations.  Therefore\r\nthe Board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in revising the\r\nchallenged regulation.  The question becomes whether the Board\r\ncomplied, as it must, with its own regulation.  See Service v.\r\nDulles, 354 U.S. 363 (1957) (recognizing the right of federal\r\ncourts to review an agency's actions to ensure that its own\r\nregulations have been followed); Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 71\r\n(1974) (stating that \"federal courts do have authority to review\r\nthe claim of a discharged governmental employee that the agency\r\neffectuating the discharge has not followed administrative\r\nregulations\"); see also Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 602 n.7\r\n(1988).\r\n           B.  Compliance With the Regulation\r\nBeverly contends that the ALJ's decision to forego\r\nwritten briefs and to issue an oral bench decision violated the\r\nNLRB regulation for two reasons:  first, the ALJ notified the\r\nparties of his decision in an untimely manner, failing to give\r\nBeverly adequate notice of his decision to follow that procedure;\r\nand second, the circumstances of this case are not appropriate for\r\nthe invocation of the regulation's oral decision.\r\nThe latter issue is easily disposed of.  Beverly cites\r\nthe regulation's statement of circumstances where oral argument in\r\nlieu of briefs would be appropriate:  \"a case that turns on a very\r\nstraightforward credibility issue; cases involving one-day\r\nhearings; cases involving a well-settled legal issue where there is\r\nno dispute as to the facts; short record single-issue cases; or\r\ncases in which a party defaults by not appearing at the hearing.\" See 59 Fed. Reg. at 46,376.  Beverly also finds \"significant[]\" a\r\npassage noting \"that in more complex cases, including cases with\r\nlengthy records, these procedures would likely not be appropriate.\" \r\nResp't Br. at 22 (quoting 59 Fed. Reg. at 65,943).  Beverly's\r\nargument is unavailing.  This two-day hearing is more akin to a\r\n\"one-day hearing[]\" than it is to a \"case[] with [a] lengthy\r\nrecord[].\"  Most of the legal issues here are \"well-settled,\" and\r\nit became clear as the hearing progressed that the factual disputes\r\nevaporated one by one, either non-existent in the first place or\r\nnot genuinely contested.  While at the outset the case appeared as\r\nif it might be \"complex,\" the reality as the evidence came in was\r\nthat the case presented a few rather straightforward applications\r\nof settled principles of labor law.  Thus, while initially the ALJ\r\nproperly left open the possibility that the case might be complex\r\nenough to require written briefs, he acted well within his\r\ndiscretion in determining, as the evidence developed, that the case\r\nwas in fact an appropriate candidate for oral arguments in lieu of\r\nbriefs.\r\nIt must be noted, too, that Beverly is incorrectly trying\r\nto limit the Board to the specific circumstances mentioned in the\r\nregulation.  Those examples were merely illustrative.  The Board's\r\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking explicitly stated that \"[t]he Board\r\nhas not tried to spell out, in the proposed rules, the\r\ncircumstances in which these procedures should be utilized.\"  59\r\nFed. Reg. at 46,376.  Instead, the Board stated that it would\r\nmonitor the implementation of the regulation and \"refine the\r\ncircumstances for which the procedures are best suited.\"  Id. \r\nThus, while the regulation sets forth \"example[s]\" of situations in\r\nwhich ALJs might opt to issue bench decisions without briefing, it\r\ndoes not require that such a practice must, or that it may not, be\r\nfollowed in any particular set of circumstances.  The regulation\r\nexplicitly leaves ALJs with discretion in deciding whether written\r\nbriefs should be permitted or dispensed with, and whether a bench\r\ndecision should be issued in any given case.  The ALJ here\r\nexercised his discretion in conformity with the Board's regulation.\r\nWe turn to the question of the ALJ's timing in notifying\r\nthe parties of his discretionary decision.  The ALJ notified the\r\nparties that he would hear oral argument in lieu of briefs during\r\na recess on the afternoon of the second day of the hearing. \r\nBeverly claims this violates the regulation's requirement that the\r\nALJ \"notify the parties at the opening of the hearing or as soon\r\nthereafter as practicable.\"  See 29 C.F.R.  102.42.  In some\r\ncases, no doubt, it will be clear at the outset that written briefs\r\nwould not be necessary, and the ALJ would therefore have to so\r\nnotify the parties at the opening of the hearing.  In other cases,\r\nsuch as the present one, however, this will not be clear at the\r\noutset, and the ALJ will have to hear some evidence in order to get\r\na feel for whether the issues are indeed complex enough to require\r\nwritten briefing, or, alternatively, simple enough for him to\r\nexercise his discretion to dispense with such briefing.  \r\nAfter hearing the evidence, the ALJ must notify the\r\nparties \"as soon . . . as practicable\" whether he will dispense\r\nwith briefing.  Here, the ALJ heard two days worth of evidence\r\ncovering each of the three alleged unfair labor practices in\r\nquestion, and decided at that point to dispense with written\r\nbriefs.  The question is whether this was the earliest time that\r\nwas practicable.  \r\nWe are concerned about the timing, in that the hearing\r\nwas all but over when the ALJ notified the parties of his decision. \r\nThis, on its face, seems contrary to the intent of the regulation\r\nrequiring notice \"at the opening of the hearing or as soon\r\nthereafter as practicable.\"  The close of the hearing is as far\r\nfrom the opening as one could get.  On the other hand, this timing\r\nmay be a perfectly reasonable application of the regulation to the\r\ncircumstances of this case.  The union alleged three unfair labor\r\npractices, and Beverly contested all three on the facts.  Such\r\ncontested issues could be complex enough to fall outside the\r\nboundaries circumscribed by the regulation for oral disposition. \r\nBut if, after hearing the evidence, it appeared that there were no\r\ngenuine factual issues in dispute, then the three issues could be\r\nreduced to the simple situation contemplated by the regulation   \r\nsituations involving well-settled legal issues where the facts are\r\nnot genuinely in dispute   and written briefs would be unnecessary.\r\nWe cannot say that the ALJ abused his discretion in so\r\nconcluding, and in notifying the parties after hearing the bulk of\r\nthe evidence in the case.  We say this with due deference to the\r\nexpertise in labor matters possessed by the ALJ and the Board that\r\nadopted his decision; we also note that the ALJ was the trier of\r\nfact who was closest to the evidence and the facts.  \r\nNor did notice at such a late time prejudice Beverly\r\nmaterially.  Counsel was given until the following morning before\r\nhe had to present his closing argument.  Such time is considered\r\nmore than sufficient for attorneys to prepare closing arguments in\r\ntrials and evidentiary hearings in courts and agencies throughout\r\nthe country, including hearings lasting substantially more than the\r\ntwo days that was the case here.  Moreover, the ALJ, after stating\r\nhis decision for the record, directly asked both parties whether he\r\nhad failed to address and resolve any element of the complaint.  At\r\nthat time, Beverly's counsel stated that he did not believe there\r\nwere any remaining unresolved issues, aside from remedy. \r\n                       Conclusion\r\nThe Board's order is ENFORCED.\r\n",

The National Labor\r\nRelations Board (NLRB or Board) petitioned this court for\r\nenforcement of its final order against Beverly Enterprises-\r\nMassachusetts, Inc. (Beverly).  See 325 NLRB No. 95 (April 9,\r\n1998).  Beverly challenges the Board's order both procedurally and\r\nsubstantively. \r\nProcedurally, the Board incorporated the Administrative\r\nLaw Judge's (ALJ's) oral bench decision, which was made without\r\naffording Beverly an opportunity to submit written briefs.  Beverly\r\ncontends that this procedure, permitted under a recent Board\r\nregulation, 29 C.F.R.  102.42, violates Section 10(c) of the\r\nNational Labor Relations Act (NLRA or Act), 29 U.S.C.  160(c). \r\nFor this reason, Beverly argues that the regulation is unlawful,\r\narbitrary and capricious.  In any event, Beverly contends that the\r\nALJ's procedure failed to comply with the regulation.  On this\r\nquestion of first impression in this circuit, we reject Beverly's\r\nprocedural claims and uphold the regulation.\r\nSubstantively, Beverly asserts that the record as a whole\r\ndoes not contain substantial evidence supporting the Board's\r\nfinding that Beverly violated Sections 8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act,\r\n29 U.S.C.  158(a)(1) and (5), by unilaterally reducing the\r\nmaximum 1996 wage increase from four percent to three percent, by\r\nunlawfully withdrawing recognition from the union representing its\r\nemployees, and by unilaterally imposing a fee for lost timecards. \r\nWe conclude that there is such substantial evidence, and enforce\r\nthe Board's order.\r\nI.                          Background\r\n                       A.  Facts\r\nThe Board found the following facts.  Beverly operates a\r\nnursing home in Plymouth, Massachusetts.  Historically, Beverly had\r\ngiven its employees annual wage increases on the anniversaries of\r\ntheir respective starting dates with the company.  At least as\r\nearly as 1990, Beverly had fixed the maximum wage increase at four\r\npercent, and it awarded that amount to approximately ninety percent\r\nof its employees.\r\nOn March 23, 1993, the NLRB certified the Hospital\r\nWorkers Union, Local 767, Service Employees International Union\r\n(the union), as the exclusive bargaining representative of all\r\nfull-time and part-time service and maintenance employees at\r\nBeverly's Plymouth facility.  \r\nBeginning in June 1993, the union and the company engaged\r\nin contract negotiations.  The parties disagreed as to the amount\r\nof wage increases the employees would receive.  In October 1994,\r\nthe union told the company that it would be difficult to persuade\r\nits unit members to accept an annual increase of less than four\r\npercent.  Later in 1994, the union negotiator indicated that the\r\ncompany would have to come up from its three percent figure if the\r\nparties were to reach agreement.  At the parties' final negotiating\r\nsession, on December 13, 1995, Beverly responded to the union's\r\nearlier proposal of four percent by proposing a two percent annual\r\nwage increase.  The union expressed shock at the newly lowered\r\noffer and did not immediately make a counteroffer.  The parties\r\nwent on to discuss an unrelated dispute (whether certain employees\r\nwere part of the bargaining unit) and tempers flared.  The union\r\nspokesperson stated that he needed to check with his attorney on\r\nthe bargaining unit issue, that he would call the company\r\nrepresentative, but that the latter \"shouldn't hold [his] breath.\"\r\nWhile these negotiations were taking place, Beverly\r\ncontinued to provide its employees with wage increases on their\r\nemployment anniversaries, and continued to award a maximum wage\r\nincrease of four percent to the overwhelming majority of them. \r\nThis practice changed in 1996, however.  That year, the company\r\ngave to approximately ninety percent of the company's unit\r\nemployees a maximum wage increase of three percent.  Beverly did\r\nnot provide notice to the union that it would lower the maximum\r\nwage increase from four percent to three percent, nor did Beverly\r\nbargain with the union over the issue.  Instead, Beverly\r\nunilaterally announced the change to the union in a letter, dated\r\nMarch 14, 1996.  The letter described the imposition of the three\r\npercent maximum wage increase as a \"compromise\" between the\r\nparties' negotiating positions.\r\nIn approximately January 1996, Beverly changed its system\r\nof keeping track of its employees' work time.  It replaced its\r\nsystem of paper timecards with a system using plastic timecards\r\nthat contained a magnetic strip.  Included in its new system was a\r\nnew policy requiring unit employees to pay a five-dollar fee for\r\nlost timecards.  In making these changes, Beverly neither gave\r\nnotice to nor bargained with the union.  As of the date of the NLRB\r\nhearing on April 15, 1997, the company had collected the five-\r\ndollar lost-timecard fee on at least seventeen occasions.\r\nBetween January and June 1996, the union contacted\r\nBeverly on several occasions and requested that it remedy its\r\nunilateral changes and that the parties resume bargaining.  In its\r\nletters, the union preconditioned further negotiations on Beverly's\r\nremedying an unrelated alleged unfair labor practice.\r\nOn June 1, 1996, the union's chief negotiator and a group\r\nof union members committed a trespass at Beverly's facility while\r\nostensibly handbilling Beverly's employees.  On June 17, 1996, the\r\nunion again wrote Beverly offering to bargain if the latter\r\nrectified all outstanding conduct which the union perceived to be\r\nviolative of the Act.  On June 25, 1996, Beverly unilaterally\r\nwithdrew recognition of the union.\r\n            B.  Board Conclusions and Order\r\nThe union filed unfair labor practice charges (ULP) with\r\nthe NLRB.  A hearing was held before a Board ALJ, who found the\r\nforegoing facts and concluded that Beverly violated Sections\r\n8(a)(1) and (5) of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C.  158(a)(1) and (5) (1994),\r\nin two separate respects:  by unilaterally reducing the maximum\r\n1996 wage increase from four percent to three percent, and by\r\nunilaterally imposing a new fee for lost timecards.  The ALJ also\r\nfound that the company violated the same statutory provisions by\r\nunlawfully withdrawing recognition of the union as the exclusive\r\nbargaining representative of Beverly's service and maintenance\r\nemployees.  Based upon its findings of fact, the Board adopted both\r\nthe findings and the recommended decision of its ALJ.\r\nAs recommended by the ALJ, the Board ordered Beverly to\r\ncease and desist from its unfair labor practices and from otherwise\r\ninterfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the\r\nexercise of their rights under Section 7 of the NLRA. \r\nAffirmatively, the Board ordered the company immediately to put\r\ninto effect the annual four percent wage increases that were\r\ncustomary prior to January 1, 1996, and to continue such increases\r\nin effect until the company negotiated a collective bargaining\r\nagreement (CBA) with the union or reached an impasse after\r\nbargaining in good faith.  The order also required the company to\r\nmake whole unit employees for any loss of pay they had suffered due\r\nto Beverly's unilateral reduction of the maximum wage increase.\r\nThe order further required Beverly to eliminate the five-\r\ndollar fee charged to employees for lost timecards until it\r\nnegotiated a CBA with the union or reached an impasse after\r\nbargaining in good faith.  It required the company to make whole\r\nits unit employees for any losses caused by the imposition of the\r\nfive-dollar fee.  Finally, the order required Beverly to bargain\r\nwith the union upon request, to embody any understanding reached in\r\na written agreement, and to post an appropriate notice.\r\nII.

The Board concluded that the company's\r\nsystem of annual wage increases was a mandatory subject of\r\ncollective bargaining, and therefore that the company, by\r\nunilaterally changing the maximum wage increase awarded, violated\r\nSection 8(a)(5) of the Act.\r\nOn this issue as on others, the Board's construction of\r\nthe Act should be upheld if it is \"reasonably defensible.\"  Ford\r\nMotor Co., 441 U.S. at 497.

It is also easy to agree that\r\nunilateral changes to that system violate Section 8(a)(5).  It is\r\nimportant to our national labor policy that companies not act\r\nunilaterally on subjects of mandatory bargaining; doing so defeats\r\nthe whole purpose of that policy's preference for peaceful\r\nnegotiation of disputes rather than industrial strife.  See \r\nWarrior &amp; Gulf, 363 U.S. at 578; Lion Oil Co., 352 U.S. at 289.\r\nBeverly argues that the three percent wage increase in\r\n1996 was not in fact a unilateral change, indeed was not a change\r\nat all, but was based on the same formula it had applied in the\r\npast when it granted a four percent maximum wage increase. \r\nBeverly's witnesses testified that company officials determined the\r\n1996 maximum wage increase exclusively by applying the same\r\n\"established formula\" that the company had used in the past to\r\nreach the four percent increase.\r\nBeverly asserts that the ALJ's decision failed to discuss\r\nthis uncontradicted testimony.  But Beverly incorrectly concludes\r\nthat this means the ALJ \"failed to consider\" Beverly's testimony. \r\nAn ALJ can consider all the evidence without directly addressing in\r\nhis written decision every piece of evidence submitted by a party. \r\nNor must an ALJ make \"explicit credibility findings\" as to each bit\r\nof conflicting testimony, so long as his factual findings as a\r\nwhole show that he \"implicitly resolve[d]\" such conflicts. \r\nN.L.R.B. v.

The Board reasonably found that the\r\ncontemporaneous letter was a \"direct explanation\" of the company's\r\ndecision to reduce the maximum wage increase from four to three\r\npercent, and \"as such constitutes an admission that the 1996\r\nmaximum wage increases were not tied to any prior formula used\" in\r\npast years by the company.

Moreover, \"few issues are less suited to appellate\r\njudicial appraisal than evaluation of bargaining processes or\r\nbetter suited to the expert experience of a Board [that] deals\r\nconstantly with such problems.\"  Id.  Substantial evidence supports\r\nthe Board's finding here that the parties had not reached impasse\r\non the question of wage increases.  \r\nAs appears from the record, the parties specifically\r\ndiscussed wages at only two bargaining sessions:  a session in\r\nOctober 1994 at which the union representative stated that it would\r\nbe difficult to persuade its unit members to accept an increase of\r\nless than four percent, and the last bargaining session on\r\nDecember 13, 1995, where Beverly's representative, Jay Begley,\r\nfirst proposed a two percent maximum wage increase, leading a union\r\nrepresentative to express shock and anger at that proposal, making\r\nno counteroffer.  At the latter session, the parties went on to\r\nargue about an unrelated dispute, tempers flared, and the union\r\nrepresentative said he had to check with his attorney about the\r\nunrelated matter, that he would call Begley but that the latter\r\n\"shouldn't hold his breath.\"  Neither party ever presented a final\r\noffer on the matter of wage increases.\r\nBeverly relies heavily on the \"hold his breath\" comment. \r\nThe company also asserts that the union \"withdrew from bargaining\r\nfor more than six months,\" that \"Beverly received no communication\r\nbeyond a few, unlawful letters from the Union after December 1995,\r\nin the wake of its Director's statement to Begley.\" \r\nComparing the instant facts   even the \"hold his breath\"\r\ncomment   to those of the precedents cited supra, we have no\r\ndifficulty upholding the Board's finding that the evidence fell far\r\nshort of establishing that the parties had reached impasse on the\r\nquestion of wages.  See WPIX, Inc., 906 F.2d at 902; Teamsters\r\nLocal Union No. 639, 924 F.2d at 1083-84; Powell Elec. Mfg. Co.,\r\n906 F.2d at 1011-12.  The \"hold his breath\" comment is similar to\r\nthe comments that were insufficient to demonstrate impasse in WPIX,\r\nInc., 906 F.2d at 902 (union's comments dismissing employer's\r\nproposals as \"ridiculous\" and a \"slap in the face\").\r\nNor does Beverly get any mileage from the union\r\nrepresentative's statement that \"it would be very difficult for the\r\nUnion to sell an increase of less than 4 percent to the unit.\"  To\r\nsay that a proposal \"would be difficult . . . to sell\" is not the\r\nsame as a rigid assertion that the union simply would not be moved\r\nfrom a four percent \"bottom line.\"  Nor does it constitute a\r\nwithdrawal from negotiations unless the company offers four\r\npercent, as Beverly asserts; on the contrary, the statement implies\r\na continuing willingness of the party to negotiate, while pointing\r\nout one area in which a lot of movement will be \"difficult.\" \r\nIndeed, the record contains evidence that the union continued to\r\nnegotiate, and stated a willingness to continue to negotiate, on a\r\nnumber of occasions after the statement relied upon by Beverly,\r\nincluding several requests, subsequent to the December 1995\r\nbargaining session, that the parties resume negotiations.  SeeTeamsters, 924 F.2d at 1083-84.\r\nMoreover, as discussed infra, Beverly's characterization\r\nof the union's subsequent actions as a withdrawal from bargaining\r\nis flawed.  Whether or not Beverly liked the union's letters   \r\nindeed, whether or not the letters contained some proposals that\r\nwere inappropriate (such as tying the irrelevant issue of an\r\nenlarged bargaining unit to the current negotiations)   the union\r\nmade it clear in its letters that it desired to continue the\r\ncollective bargaining process.  The parties were a long way from\r\nimpasse, as the Board and the courts have defined it through their\r\nprecedents.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, substantial evidence supports\r\nthe Board's finding that Beverly's reduction of the maximum wage\r\nincrease was a unilateral change in the terms and conditions of\r\nemployment, imposed when the parties were not at impasse, and we\r\nmust uphold the Board's finding that Beverly violated Sections\r\n8(a)(1) and (5) of the Act by unilaterally reducing the maximum\r\nwage increase from four percent to three percent.\r\n             C.  The Fee for Lost Timecards  The second unfair labor practice found by the Board was\r\nBeverly's unilateral imposition of a five-dollar charge for lost\r\ntimecards.  The company does not dispute that it implemented a new\r\npolicy in January 1996 requiring all employees to pay a five-dollar\r\ncharge for lost timecards, nor that it undertook this new policy\r\nwithout notice to or bargaining with the union.  Beverly\r\ncharacterizes the change as a mere \"change to time-clock\r\nprocedure,\" and argues that it therefore does not rise to the level\r\nof a change in terms and conditions of employment.  \r\nBut Beverly mischaracterizes the issue:  the union did\r\nnot argue and the Board did not find that Beverly had to bargain\r\nwith the union about a purely mechanical change to its \"time-clock\r\nprocedure.\"  The Board held that the company's charging of a fee \r\nto employees for lost timecards   not the procedure that management\r\nrequired workers to follow to record their time   constituted a\r\nchange in a term or condition of employment, and therefore\r\nBeverly's unilateral change in such terms or conditions without\r\nfirst pursuing collective bargaining violated the NLRA.  SeeN.L.R.B. v. Katz, 369 U.S. at 743.  \r\nThis general principle has been upheld in many different\r\ncontexts.  See N.L.R.B. v.

The Board held\r\nin Millard Processing that the imposition of a replacement fee\r\nqualifies as a \"material, substantial, and significant\" change in\r\nthe terms and conditions of employment.  310 NLRB at 424-25. \r\nMoreover, the Board's determination that the imposition of a fee\r\nfor lost timecards is a mandatory subject of bargaining is entitled\r\nto considerable deference \"because the classification of bargaining\r\nsubjects as terms or conditions of employment is a matter\r\nconcerning which the Board has special expertise.\"  Daily News of\r\nLos Angeles, 73 F.3d at 411 (quoting Ford Motor Co., 441 U.S. at\r\n495).  \r\nBeverly relies on Rust Craft Broad. of New York, Inc.,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), to support its position that the company's\r\nchanging its timekeeping procedures was within its management\r\nprerogative and not a change in terms or conditions of employment\r\nthat is a mandatory subject of bargaining.  Such reliance is\r\nmisplaced.  The employer in Rust Craft simply instituted a \"change\r\nto a mechanical procedure for recording working time,\" installing\r\ntime clocks to replace its former system of requiring employees to\r\nrecord their time manually.  Id. at 327.  The company's actions did\r\nnot impose any new monetary burdens on its employees.  But\r\nBeverly's actions here did impose such burdens:  the employees had\r\nto pay five dollars for any lost timecards.\r\nBeverly also argues that the five-dollar charge simply\r\nreflected Beverly's passing along its cost to replace a card.  But\r\nhow Beverly derived its five-dollar fee is not the issue.  It may\r\nbe perfectly fair, but the problem is that the fee constitutes a\r\nchange in the terms and conditions of employment and Beverly must\r\nbargain with the union over such issues, not unilaterally impose\r\nthem (unless impasse is reached).\r\nThe only legitimate question Beverly raises is whether\r\nits unilateral change in the terms and conditions of employment is\r\n\"nominal,\" so \"insignificant\" as to be de minimis.  Put another\r\nway, is the size of the replacement fee so small that Beverly could\r\nimpose it without having to negotiate with the union at all? \r\nWe see no reason not to defer to the Board's conclusion\r\nthat the fee should have been the subject of bargaining before\r\nbeing imposed.  Although a five-dollar fee is getting close to the\r\nde minimis line, we need not decide where that line is.  Cf.Millard Processing, 310 NLRB at 424-25 (fifteen-dollar fee for\r\nreplacing lost checks).\r\nMore importantly, our national labor policy prefers\r\nemployers and employees to bargain collectively over terms and\r\nconditions of employment, rather than to take unilateral action\r\nthat can lead to industrial strife.  Under that labor policy, the\r\npresumption is in favor of a duty to bargain, and against an\r\nexception to that duty on the ground that the unilateral action is\r\nallegedly de minimis.\r\n       D.  Withdrawing Recognition from the Union\r\nBeverly also violated the NLRA by withdrawing recognition\r\nfrom the union.  There is no dispute that the company withdrew such\r\nrecognition on June 25, 1996.  Beverly argues that it was justified\r\nin doing so, based on three independent justifications.  We agree\r\nwith the Board that each of Beverly's contentions is without merit. \r\nThe same essential reasoning applies in this area as applied with\r\nthe above-described changes in terms and conditions of employment. \r\nThe NLRA favors an employer's duty to bargain collectively; the\r\npresumption is against the appropriateness of an employer's\r\nunilaterally withdrawing recognition from a certified labor\r\norganization representing its employees.\r\nBeverly points first to the union's \"unlawful invasion\"\r\nof company premises on June 1, 1996, as justification for the\r\nwithdrawal of recognition.  On that date, a group of union\r\nsupporters, including its chief negotiator, entered the nursing\r\nhome facility and attempted to handbill employees.  This arguably\r\nconstituted an unfair labor practice, as well as a trespass,\r\ntortious and/or criminal.\r\nIn extreme circumstances, the Board has withheld\r\notherwise appropriate bargaining orders.  Beverly cites two such\r\ncases, N.L.R.B. v. Union Nacional de Trabajadores, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"338413\"><a href=\"/opinion/338413/national-labor-relations-board-v-union-nacional-de-trabajadores-and-its/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st\r\nCir. 1976), and Laura Modes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">144</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">1592</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1962).  But\r\nsignificantly, in Trabajadores and Laura Modes, it was the Boardthat applied the sanction, not the employer that unilaterally\r\nwithdrew recognition of the union.  Beverly has not cited any cases\r\nin which an employer has been allowed unilaterally to withdraw\r\nrecognition of a union as a form of \"self-help\" even in response to\r\nviolent tactics.  Moreover, as we have held, even the issuance of\r\na decertification order by the Board \"is an extreme measure and\r\nshould be entered only when the Board has first demonstrated that\r\nthere are no equally effective alternative means of promoting the\r\nobjectives of the Act.\"  Union Nacional de Trabajadores, 540 F.2d\r\nat 13.\r\nThere is another reason why Beverly's withdrawal of\r\nrecognition was unjustified, in addition to the company's engaging\r\nin self-help rather than pursuing the statutorily-provided means of\r\nfiling a complaint with the Board.  The conduct in Trabajadores,\r\nLaura Modes and similar cases was far more egregious than that of\r\nthe union here:  the union \"engaged in violent misconduct so\r\naggravated as to preclude the maintenance of normal collective\r\nbargaining relationships.\"  Trabajadores, 540 F.2d at 13; see alsoLaura Modes, 144 NLRB at 1596 (finding that the union exhibited \"a\r\ntotal disinterest in enforcing its representation rights through\r\nthe peaceful legal process provided by the Act,\" and instead\r\n\"resorted to and/or encouraged the use of violent tactics to compel\r\ntheir grant\").  In Laura Modes, a union agent and eight non-\r\nemployee union members entered the employer's plant, struck a\r\nmanagement official in the face when he threatened to call the\r\npolice, and \"pushed around\" an office employee.  A few days later,\r\na union member followed an official of the employer as he left the\r\nplant and pointed him out to a group of four men, who beat him up. \r\n144 NLRB at 1594.  Similarly, in Union Nacional de Trabajadores,\r\n540 F.2d at 6-7, the Board revoked a union's certification where\r\nthe union president (1) \"brutally\" assaulted the president of the\r\nemployer in the presence of employees and (2) threatened employees\r\nwith serious bodily harm if they continued to work during a union-\r\nsponsored strike:  \"This is Union Nacional and we kill people.  So\r\nleave.\"  See also So-Lo Foods, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">749</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991) (noting\r\nthat the principle of Laura Modes \"is only rarely applied to\r\ndeprive a union of representative rights,\" is limited to behavior\r\nsimilar to the \"repugnant and barbaric\" attacks in Laura Modes, and\r\neven then, the union would not be permanently barred).\r\nThe union's trespass in the instant case   with no\r\nviolence committed or threatened   did not come close to the level\r\nof egregiousness that would justify a withdrawal of recognition,\r\neven by the Board.  We cannot agree with Beverly that one incident\r\nof trespass, with no violence at all, demonstrates per se that the\r\n\"union has abandoned any interest in carrying on collective\r\nbargaining on behalf of its members through lawful means and has\r\ninstead sought to ensure their support through coercion.\"  Resp't\r\nBr. at 31.

The union's\r\nactions may well have constituted unfair labor practices, and, if\r\nthe company had filed such complaints with the Board, it is quite\r\npossible that the Board would have so held, depending of course on\r\nthe facts found by the Board.

We\r\nemphasize again that self-help is to be discouraged and collective\r\nbargaining encouraged.

In the\r\ndiscretion of the administrative law judge,\r\nany party may, upon request made before the\r\nclose of the hearing, file a brief or proposed\r\nfindings and conclusions, or both, with the\r\nadministrative law judge, . . . .  In any case\r\nin which the administrative law judge believes\r\nthat written briefs or proposed findings of\r\nfact and conclusions may not be necessary, he\r\nor she shall notify the parties at the opening\r\nof the hearing or as soon thereafter as\r\npracticable that he or she may wish to hear\r\noral argument in lieu of briefs.\r\n\n29 C.F.R.  102.42 (1998).\r\n\nBeverly contends that this regulation cannot stand\r\nbecause the procedure contained therein violates Section 10(c) of\r\nthe Act, 29 U.S.C.  160(c).  But Section 10(c) cannot bear the\r\nweight that Beverly seeks to load upon it.  The statute does not\r\nentitle parties to an opportunity to file written briefs instead of\r\noral argument; it states that parties \"may\" file briefs \"in [the]\r\ndiscretion [of the ALJ].\"  29 U.S.C.  160(c).  The taking of\r\ntestimony is treated differently than the making of arguments at\r\nthe close of the testimony.  \"The testimony taken by [the ALJ]\r\nshall be reduced to writing and filed with the Board.  Thereafter,\r\nin its discretion, the Board upon notice may take further testimony\r\nor hear argument.\"  Id. (emphasis added).  \r\nThus, Beverly gains nothing by arguing that the\r\nregulation \"conflicts with Congressional intent as expressed in the\r\nAct\" because Section 10(c), in Beverly's words, \"unambiguously\r\nrequires the testimony taken by the ALJ to be 'reduced to\r\nwriting.'\"  Resp't Br. at 18 (first emphasis added) (quoting 29\r\nU.S.C.  160(c)).  Beverly does not contend that the ALJ failed to\r\nreduce any \"testimony\" to writing, only that Beverly was not\r\npermitted to submit a written brief instead of making an oral\r\nargument at the close of all the evidence.  \r\nIt is true, as Beverly further argues, that the statute\r\ngoes on to require, where evidence is presented to an ALJ, that the\r\nALJ \"shall issue and cause to be served on the parties to the\r\nproceeding a proposed report, together with a recommended order,\r\nwhich shall be filed with the Board.\"  Id.  But here too, there is\r\nnothing to preclude, either implicitly or explicitly, the agency\r\nfrom adopting the procedure permitted in the challenged rule: \r\nrequiring the ALJ to \"certify the accuracy of the pages of the\r\ntranscript containing the decision\" and to cause a copy of those\r\npages to be served on the parties and filed with the Board.  29\r\nC.F.R.  102.45.  In light of the deference due to the Board's\r\ninterpretation of the Act, we see no reason to disturb the Board's\r\nconclusion that \"these provisions provide for a written decision,\r\nin the form of a certified copy of the record pages containing the\r\njudge's full decision, which is served on the parties, in full\r\ncompliance with the provisions of Section 10(c) of the Act.\"  59\r\nFed. Reg. 65,942, 65,944 (Dec. 22, 1994).\r\nBeverly also claims that the Board, in adopting that\r\nregulation, overruled its long-standing precedent without supplying\r\nadequate reasons for doing so.  Resp't Br. at 19 (citing Plumbers,\r\nLocal 195 (Stone &amp; Webster), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978); Plastic Film\r\nProds.

Beverly argues that the Board\r\nacted arbitrarily and capriciously in violation of the APA by\r\namending its regulation, \"because [of] the Board's mystifying lack\r\nof reasoning in overruling its own precedent in order to justify\r\nthe Regulation.\"  Id.  As noted, a reviewing court must \"hold\r\nunlawful and set aside agency action\" that is \"arbitrary\" or\r\n\"capricious.\"  5 U.S.C.  706(2)(a).\r\nBeverly's inadequate-reasons contention is also without\r\nmerit, as the Board amply stated its reasons for revising the\r\nregulation.  The Board stated that it was revising the regulation\r\nin order to improve \"the role that [Board ALJs] play in\r\nfacilitating the expeditious resolution of unfair labor practice\r\nproceedings.\"  59 Fed. Reg. 46,375 (Sept. 8, 1994).  It offered\r\nthis regulation as \"part of its ongoing review of ways in which\r\nunfair labor practice proceedings can be revamped to move the cases\r\nmore expeditiously.\"  Id. at 46,376.  Further, the Board addressed\r\nthe concerns expressed in comments submitted in response to the\r\nproposed regulations:  the Board stated that the benefits provided\r\nthrough allowing ALJs to issue bench decisions would outweigh the\r\ndelays that might arise \"in the few cases where the procedure is\r\nimprovidently utilized.\"  Id. at 65,943.  Additionally, the Board\r\nexplained that it was consciously overruling the two cases relied\r\non by Beverly, because those cases were \"based on a misreading of\r\nthe requirements of Section 10(c) of the Act.\"  Id. at 65,943-44. \r\nThe Board also pointed to another intervening case where it had\r\nupheld an oral decision by a judge.  See Jumbo Produce, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">998</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 998-99 (1989) (noting that, in Plumbers, Local 195, \"the judge\r\norally granted the Respondent's motion for summary dismissal\r\nstating only that the General Counsel had failed to establish a\r\nprima facie case.

The Board considered relevant precedent, discussed\r\nthe objections raised through the comments submitted, and clearly\r\narticulated its reasoning in revising the regulations.  Therefore\r\nthe Board did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in revising the\r\nchallenged regulation.  The question becomes whether the Board\r\ncomplied, as it must, with its own regulation.

Compliance With the Regulation\r\nBeverly contends that the ALJ's decision to forego\r\nwritten briefs and to issue an oral bench decision violated the\r\nNLRB regulation for two reasons:  first, the ALJ notified the\r\nparties of his decision in an untimely manner, failing to give\r\nBeverly adequate notice of his decision to follow that procedure;\r\nand second, the circumstances of this case are not appropriate for\r\nthe invocation of the regulation's oral decision.\r\nThe latter issue is easily disposed of.  Beverly cites\r\nthe regulation's statement of circumstances where oral argument in\r\nlieu of briefs would be appropriate:  \"a case that turns on a very\r\nstraightforward credibility issue; cases involving one-day\r\nhearings; cases involving a well-settled legal issue where there is\r\nno dispute as to the facts; short record single-issue cases; or\r\ncases in which a party defaults by not appearing at the hearing.\" See 59 Fed. Reg. at 46,376.  Beverly also finds \"significant[]\" a\r\npassage noting \"that in more complex cases, including cases with\r\nlengthy records, these procedures would likely not be appropriate.\" \r\nResp't Br. at 22 (quoting 59 Fed. Reg. at 65,943).  Beverly's\r\nargument is unavailing.  This two-day hearing is more akin to a\r\n\"one-day hearing[]\" than it is to a \"case[] with [a] lengthy\r\nrecord[].\"  Most of the legal issues here are \"well-settled,\" and\r\nit became clear as the hearing progressed that the factual disputes\r\nevaporated one by one, either non-existent in the first place or\r\nnot genuinely contested.  While at the outset the case appeared as\r\nif it might be \"complex,\" the reality as the evidence came in was\r\nthat the case presented a few rather straightforward applications\r\nof settled principles of labor law.  Thus, while initially the ALJ\r\nproperly left open the possibility that the case might be complex\r\nenough to require written briefs, he acted well within his\r\ndiscretion in determining, as the evidence developed, that the case\r\nwas in fact an appropriate candidate for oral arguments in lieu of\r\nbriefs.\r\nIt must be noted, too, that Beverly is incorrectly trying\r\nto limit the Board to the specific circumstances mentioned in the\r\nregulation.  Those examples were merely illustrative.  The Board's\r\nNotice of Proposed Rulemaking explicitly stated that \"[t]he Board\r\nhas not tried to spell out, in the proposed rules, the\r\ncircumstances in which these procedures should be utilized.\"  59\r\nFed. Reg. at 46,376.  Instead, the Board stated that it would\r\nmonitor the implementation of the regulation and \"refine the\r\ncircumstances for which the procedures are best suited.\"  Id. \r\nThus, while the regulation sets forth \"example[s]\" of situations in\r\nwhich ALJs might opt to issue bench decisions without briefing, it\r\ndoes not require that such a practice must, or that it may not, be\r\nfollowed in any particular set of circumstances.  The regulation\r\nexplicitly leaves ALJs with discretion in deciding whether written\r\nbriefs should be permitted or dispensed with, and whether a bench\r\ndecision should be issued in any given case.  The ALJ here\r\nexercised his discretion in conformity with the Board's regulation.\r\nWe turn to the question of the ALJ's timing in notifying\r\nthe parties of his discretionary decision.  The ALJ notified the\r\nparties that he would hear oral argument in lieu of briefs during\r\na recess on the afternoon of the second day of the hearing. \r\nBeverly claims this violates the regulation's requirement that the\r\nALJ \"notify the parties at the opening of the hearing or as soon\r\nthereafter as practicable.\"  See 29 C.F.R.  102.42.  In some\r\ncases, no doubt, it will be clear at the outset that written briefs\r\nwould not be necessary, and the ALJ would therefore have to so\r\nnotify the parties at the opening of the hearing.  In other cases,\r\nsuch as the present one, however, this will not be clear at the\r\noutset, and the ALJ will have to hear some evidence in order to get\r\na feel for whether the issues are indeed complex enough to require\r\nwritten briefing, or, alternatively, simple enough for him to\r\nexercise his discretion to dispense with such briefing.  \r\nAfter hearing the evidence, the ALJ must notify the\r\nparties \"as soon . . . as practicable\" whether he will dispense\r\nwith briefing.  Here, the ALJ heard two days worth of evidence\r\ncovering each of the three alleged unfair labor practices in\r\nquestion, and decided at that point to dispense with written\r\nbriefs.  The question is whether this was the earliest time that\r\nwas practicable.  \r\nWe are concerned about the timing, in that the hearing\r\nwas all but over when the ALJ notified the parties of his decision. \r\nThis, on its face, seems contrary to the intent of the regulation\r\nrequiring notice \"at the opening of the hearing or as soon\r\nthereafter as practicable.\"  The close of the hearing is as far\r\nfrom the opening as one could get.  On the other hand, this timing\r\nmay be a perfectly reasonable application of the regulation to the\r\ncircumstances of this case.  The union alleged three unfair labor\r\npractices, and Beverly contested all three on the facts.  Such\r\ncontested issues could be complex enough to fall outside the\r\nboundaries circumscribed by the regulation for oral disposition. \r\nBut if, after hearing the evidence, it appeared that there were no\r\ngenuine factual issues in dispute, then the three issues could be\r\nreduced to the simple situation contemplated by the regulation   \r\nsituations involving well-settled legal issues where the facts are\r\nnot genuinely in dispute   and written briefs would be unnecessary.\r\nWe cannot say that the ALJ abused his discretion in so\r\nconcluding, and in notifying the parties after hearing the bulk of\r\nthe evidence in the case.  We say this with due deference to the\r\nexpertise in labor matters possessed by the ALJ and the Board that\r\nadopted his decision; we also note that the ALJ was the trier of\r\nfact who was closest to the evidence and the facts.  \r\nNor did notice at such a late time prejudice Beverly\r\nmaterially.  Counsel was given until the following morning before\r\nhe had to present his closing argument.  Such time is considered\r\nmore than sufficient for attorneys to prepare closing arguments in\r\ntrials and evidentiary hearings in courts and agencies throughout\r\nthe country, including hearings lasting substantially more than the\r\ntwo days that was the case here.  Moreover, the ALJ, after stating\r\nhis decision for the record, directly asked both parties whether he\r\nhad failed to address and resolve any element of the complaint.  At\r\nthat time, Beverly's counsel stated that he did not believe there\r\nwere any remaining unresolved issues, aside from remedy. \r\n                       Conclusion\r\nThe Board's order is ENFORCED.\r\n</pre>",
