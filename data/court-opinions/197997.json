Michael  A. Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nRandy Olen for appellant.\r\nAriane D. Vuono, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom \r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 8, 1998\r\n\nPer Curiam.  Defendant-appellant Benjamin Paniagua\r\nappeals his convictions for possession with intent to distribute\r\nand distribution of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \r\n841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(B) and 18 U.S.C.  2, and possession with\r\nintent to distribute and distribution of heroin, in violation of 21\r\nU.S.C.  841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.  2.  Paniagua claims that the\r\ndistrict court improperly refused to instruct the jury on the\r\naffirmative defense of duress and improperly admitted evidence of\r\nthe defendant's prior bad acts.  Because of these alleged errors,\r\nPaniagua argues that he was deprived of a fair trial.  After\r\ncareful review of the record, we affirm the convictions.  \r\n1.  We review de novo the district court's refusal to\r\ninstruct the jury on a proposed duress and coercion defense,\r\nviewing \"the record 'most charitably to the proponent of the\r\ninstruction.'\"  See United States v. Arthurs, 73 F.3d 444, 448 (1st\r\nCir. 1996)(quoting United States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 121 (1st\r\nCir. 1987)).  A duress defense has three elements: (1) an immediate\r\nthreat of serious bodily injury or death, (2) a well-grounded\r\nbelief that the threat will be carried out, and (3) no reasonable\r\nopportunity to escape or otherwise to frustrate the threat.   SeeUnited States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 291 (1st Cir. 1992)(citing\r\ncases).  \"A defendant is entitled to an instruction on a duress\r\ndefense only after he has produced sufficient evidence from which\r\na rational jury could find all of the elements of the defense.\"  \r\nUnited States v. Sotelo, 94 F.3d 1037, 1039 (7th Cir. 1996). \r\nPaniagua was convicted largely on the evidence collected\r\nthrough the cooperation of a government informant named Victor\r\nRodriguez.  Rodriguez and Paniagua were both members of \"La\r\nFamilia,\" a Hispanic gang that operated throughout western\r\nMassachusetts.  In May 1995, Rodriguez was arrested and charged\r\nwith intent to distribute crack cocaine.  After his arrest\r\nRodriguez agreed to work for the Western Massachusetts Gang Task\r\nForce (\"WMGTF\") in an undercover capacity.   \r\nRodriguez subsequently arranged two drug purchases from\r\nPaniagua.  The first, a crack cocaine purchase, took place on May\r\n3, 1996, at Rodriguez's photography studio.  Subsequently, on May\r\n22, 1996, Rodriguez purchased heroin from Paniagua at Paniagua's\r\nhome.\r\nThroughout the trial, Paniagua attempted to build a\r\nduress defense by eliciting testimony to demonstrate that Rodriguez\r\nwas a religious priest in the Santeria and Palerus religions and a\r\ngang leader who \"exerted such extraordinary power, control, and\r\ninfluence over Mr. Paniagua, that Mr. Paniagua was incapable of\r\nresisting Mr. Rodriguez's entreaties to commit the charged\r\noffenses.\"  Although the district court was initially concerned\r\nthat defense counsel intended to impeach Rodriguez's credibility\r\nsolely by attacking his religious beliefs, the court eventually\r\ngave Paniagua leeway to pursue this defense.  \r\nRodriguez in his testimony acknowledged his position\r\nwithin the religions and described his religious activities.  In\r\naddition, he testified that gang members were sometimes violently\r\npunished for breaking the rules of the gang, which were described\r\nin a document called \"The Book of Love.\"  Defense counsel was\r\nunable to elicit testimony, however, to establish that specific\r\nthreats were directed at the defendant in connection with the\r\noffense conduct or that Rodriguez had used his position as a\r\nreligious figure to intimidate or coerce the defendant.  At the\r\nconclusion of the evidence, the district court refused to instruct\r\nthe jury on duress, finding that \"there is no evidence, zero\r\nevidence as I look at it, that there was a reasonable belief that\r\nimmediate or imminent death or serious bodily harm would follow if\r\nMr. Paniagua did not commit the crime.\"  \r\n We agree with the district court that the evidence was\r\nnot sufficient to warrant a specialized instruction on duress or\r\ncoercion.  Neither the scant testimony concerning defendant's\r\ngeneralized fear of Rodriguez's position as a religious figure nor\r\nthe testimony describing the pressure to commit crime that inures\r\nfrom gang association provides an adequate evidentiary basis from\r\nwhich a reasonable jury could find that Paniagua committed the\r\ncharged offense under an immediate threat of serious bodily injury\r\nor death and had no reasonable opportunity to avoid committing it. \r\nSee, e.g.,  United States v. Gaviria, 116 F.3d 1498, 1530-32 (D.C.\r\nCir. 1997).  \"[F]ear alone is not sufficient to make a prima facie\r\ncase of duress.\"  United States v. Jennell, 749 F.2d 1302, 1305\r\n(9th Cir. 1984). \r\n2.   Paniagua next objects to the admission of evidence\r\nthat implicated him in a drug deal on January 5, 1996.  Paniagua\r\nobjected to this evidence on relevance grounds because he had not\r\nbeen charged with committing a crime on that date.  The district\r\ncourt found that the evidence was relevant to rebut the defendant's\r\nargument that he sold drugs to Rodriguez under duress.  Paniagua\r\nclaims that the district court erred by allowing this evidence to\r\ncome into evidence without instructing the jury on Mr. Paniagua's\r\naffirmative defenses.  We disagree.   \r\nEven though the court ultimately refused to instruct the\r\njury on the duress defense, the district court did not abuse its\r\nbroad discretion in finding that the evidence when offered was\r\nrelevant to rebut the defense raised by the defendant during the\r\ntrial.  Cf. United States v. Pratt, 913 F.3d 982, 989-90 (1st Cir.\r\n1990). \r\n3.  Paniagua raises a number of other contentions but\r\nnone of these issues were properly preserved for appellate review\r\nand thus are subject to review for \"plain error\" only.  See United\r\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734-35 (1993).  After carefully\r\nreviewing the record, we are satisfied that none of these alleged\r\nerrors raises a concern about the fundamental fairness of the\r\nproceedings below.\r\nAffirmed.\n",
