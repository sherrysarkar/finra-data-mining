Lederer, Assistant United States Attorney, and\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\fApril 9, 2001\n\f              Per   curiam.     In     this   appeal,   defendant-appellant\n\nAlberto Bonilla urges us to vacate his convictions under Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 52(b) on the ground that jury instructions to which he\n\nlodged   no     objection     were    plainly   erroneous,      affected     his\n\nsubstantial rights, and \"seriously affect[ed] the fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of [the] judicial proceedings\" in\n\nwhich he was convicted.         United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n736-37 (1993) (describing situations in which appellate courts\n\nshould exercise the limited power Rule 52(b) confers) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).            Bonilla makes two specific arguments\n\nin support of this request in his well-written appellate brief.\n\nFirst,   he    argues   that   the     instructions     on   Count   IV,   which\n\ncharged him with aiding and abetting the use and carrying of a\n\nfirearm during and in relation to the specific federal crimes\n\ncharged in Counts I-III, constructively amended the indictment\n\nby permitting him to be convicted of aiding and abetting the use\n\nand carrying of a firearm during and in relation to one or more\n\nuncharged offenses.       Second, he asserts that the instructions on\n\nreasonable doubt, which in several instances juxtaposed the\n\nconcepts of guilt and innocence, undercut the presumption of\n\ninnocence and reduced the government's burden of proof.                     See,\n\ne.g., United States v. DeLuca, 137 F.3d 24, 37 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\f(cautioning against use of the term \"innocence\" in reasonable\n\ndoubt instructions because it might prompt the jury \"to convict\n\nwhere the evidence, though inadequate to prove guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, nonetheless indicated that the defendant may\n\nnot have been 'innocent'\") (citation omitted); United States v.\n\nAndujar, 49 F.3d 16, 24 (1st Cir. 1995) (similar); United States\n\nv. Mendoza-Acevedo, 950 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1991) (similar).\n\n          We have read the record and conclude that, even if the\n\nchallenged instructions were less than ideal, this is not a case\n\nthat warrants an exercise of our discretion to notice any errors\n\nunder Rule 52(b).   With respect to the instructions on Count IV,\n\nit suffices to observe that it was all but undisputed that the\n\nhome invaded by Bonilla's confederates was targeted because it\n\nwas thought to contain drugs and drug money, and that the\n\nevidence was more than sufficient to support the conclusion that\n\nBonilla aided and abetted the use and carrying of the firearms\n\nemployed in this home invasion.         Thus, notwithstanding the\n\nabsence of unanimous verdicts on Counts I-III and the jury's\n\nquestion about drugs, we do not regard the conviction on Count\n\nIV as a \"miscarriage of justice\" within the meaning of Olano.\n\nSee 507 U.S. at 736-37.       With respect to the reasonable doubt\n\ninstructions, it suffices to note that the instructions as a\n\nwhole   clearly   explained   the   presumption   of   innocence   and\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\frepeatedly emphasized the government's burden of proof.   We thus\n\nare confident that the instructions adequately informed the jury\n\nthat it should not convict Bonilla unless it was satisfied that\n\nthe government had proved him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSee, e.g., DeLuca, 137 F.3d at 37; Andujar, 49 F.3d at 24-25;\n\nMendoza-Acevedo, 950 F.2d at 4-5.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -5-\n\f",
