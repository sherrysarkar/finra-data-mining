Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n         Before\r\n\nTorruella, Chief Judge,\r\nBoudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges. \r\n\nJoseph C.

Upon careful consideration of the briefs and\r\nrecord presented for this appeal, we conclude that the sentence\r\nimposed upon revocation of supervised release was within the\r\ndistrict court's authority under 18 U.S.C.  3583(e)(3) and was not\r\ninconsistent with U.S.S.G.  7B1.4.  See United States v. O'Neil,\r\n11 F.3d 292, 301 n.11 (1st Cir. 1993).  In our view, the district\r\ncourt's stated reasons for the 18-month prison term were entirely\r\nconventional, aimed at protecting society from a defendant in need\r\nof substance abuse treatment, and raised no issue within the plain\r\nthrust of 28 U.S.C.  944(k).\r\nAffirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n          -2-\n",
