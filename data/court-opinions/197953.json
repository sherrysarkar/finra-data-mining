Local 254, Service Employees International\r\nUnion, AFL-CIO (\"the Union\") petitions this court for review of\r\na NLRB decision finding that the Union engaged in unfair labor\r\npractices, in violation of the \"secondary boycott\" provisions\r\nof the NLRA, 29 U.S.C.  158(b)(4)(ii)(B).  The Union's sole\r\nargument on appeal is that the Board erred in concluding that\r\nMassachusetts Bay Community College was not a \"joint employer\"\r\nof certain cleaning workers who were directly employed by Aid\r\nMaintenance Co., Inc., and that the Union's picketing and other\r\nactivities at the College therefore did not constitute unlawful\r\n\"secondary\" activity.\r\n    We do not agree.  The question whether the College was a\r\n\"joint employer\" of the Aid Maintenance cleaners is a factual\r\none.  See Holyoke Visiting Nurses Ass'n v. NLRB, 11 F.3d 302,\r\n306 (1st Cir. 1993).  Having carefully reviewed the record and\r\nthe parties' submissions, we conclude that the ALJ's decision\r\non this factual issue, as adopted by the Board, is supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence on the record considered as a whole.  The\r\nBoard's order as it pertains to the Aid Maintenance case is,\r\ntherefore, entitled to be enforced.\r\n    We note, additionally, that this matter originally\r\ninvolved two sets of unfair labor practice charges, one filed\r\nby Aid Maintenance and the other by Women and Infants Hospital. \r\nThe Union has not petitioned for review of the Board's decision\r\nas to the charges filed by the Hospital.  Thus, the Board is\r\nalso entitled to enforcement of its order as it pertains to the\r\nHospital's case.\r\n    For the reasons stated, the Union's petition is denied,\r\nand the Board's cross-application for summary enforcement is\r\ngranted.\r\n\n    So Ordered.\n",
