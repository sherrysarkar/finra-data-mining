Juan M. Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nAlexander Zeno on brief for appellant.\r\nGuillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Timothy L. Faerber, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, and Jose A. Quiles, Senior Litigation Counsel,\r\non brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                       March 17, 1998\r\n                                         \r\n\n       Per Curiam.  Defendant Kelly Jane Rankin pleaded\r\nguilty to charges that she and her codefendants conspired to\r\nuse the mails and wires to engage in a scheme to defraud\r\nvarious persons by telling them that money they handed over to\r\nthe defendants would be invested in such a way as to produce\r\nhigh returns; instead, the defendants kept the money for\r\nthemselves.  Defendant now argues that her guilty plea should\r\nbe set aside and that her attorney provided ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel.  We reject the first argument on the\r\nmerits and find that the second claim must be raised in a\r\nmotion under 28 U.S.C.  2255. \r\n         1.  The Guilty Plea\r\n         Defendant contends on appeal that the district court\r\nabused its discretion in denying her motion to withdraw her\r\nguilty plea.  However, on July 28, 1997, defendant filed,\r\nthrough counsel, a motion to withdraw the motion to change her\r\nplea.  The district court essentially allowed this motion when\r\nit endorsed the motion to change the plea as \"withdrawn.\" \r\nAlthough both parties to this appeal inexplicably fail to\r\nmention the withdrawal of the motion to change the guilty plea,\r\nwe think it is dispositive.  That is, because defendant\r\nwithdrew her motion to change her guilty plea and because the\r\ndistrict court therefore never ruled on the motion's merits,\r\nthe motion simply is not before this court.\r\n         We may nonetheless review the guilty plea itself to\r\ndetermine whether the plea was deficient.  See United States v.\r\nParra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d 588, 593-94 (1st Cir. 1991). \r\nDefendant's first contention is that her plea was not voluntary\r\nand knowing because the district court never sufficiently\r\ninformed her of the nature of the charges against her.  SeeFed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(1).  Specifically, defendant contends\r\nthat the lower court never told her that to be found guilty on\r\nthe conspiracy count, the government would need to prove that\r\nshe intended to join the conspiracy, something, defendant\r\navers, that she always has denied.  We see no merit to this\r\ncontention.\r\n         Here, count one of the indictment charged that\r\ndefendants \"knowingly, willfully, unlawfully, and intentionallycombine[d], conspire[d] . . . and agree[d] together and with\r\neach other\" to devise a scheme to obtain money by means of\r\nfalse pretenses.  Third Superseding Indictment, Count One\r\n(emphasis added).  At the change of plea hearing, the judge\r\nquoted count one in its entirety and defendant confirmed that\r\nthis was what she was pleading guilty to.  Transcript of Change\r\nof Plea Hearing, at 5, 11-16.  This is sufficient under\r\nHenderson v. Morgan, 426 U.S. 637 (1976).  See Marshall v.\r\nLonberger, 459 U.S. 422, 437-38 (1983) (relying on the trial\r\njudge's recitation of part of the indictment as a factor in\r\nconcluding that defendant had received adequate notice of the\r\ncharges against him).\r\n         Defendant's other argument regarding the charges --\r\nthat she never was told about the full extent of the conspiracy\r\n(defrauding persons of approximately $1,900,000) and never was\r\ninformed that under the sentencing guidelines, she could be\r\nordered to pay as much as $1,900,000 in restitution -- also\r\nfails.  First, defendant has not been prejudiced because no\r\nrestitution has been ordered.  In any event, the district court\r\njudge specifically informed defendant that she could be fined\r\nas much as $3,500,000.  Transcript of Change of Plea Hearing,\r\nat 8-10.  Thus, any error was harmless.  See United States v.\r\nRaineri, 42 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 1994) (where a defendant is\r\nrequired to pay restitution in an amount less than the\r\npotential fine of which he was warned, the failure to inform\r\nthe defendant at the change of plea hearing that restitution is\r\na possibility is harmless error).\r\n         Defendant next contends that the district court\r\nfailed to comply with Rule 11(f) because it did not ensure that\r\nthere was a factual basis for the guilty plea.  However, a\r\nreview of the change of plea hearing reveals that the\r\nprosecutor set out the evidence it would prove if the case went\r\nto trial, including specific acts of fraud in which defendant\r\nhad engaged and evidence concerning her knowledge of the\r\nfraudulent scheme.  See Transcript of Change of Plea Hearing,\r\nat 20-25.  Courts have held that the prosecutor's statement of\r\nfacts on the record can satisfy the requirement of a factual\r\nbasis for the plea.  See, e.g., United States v. Ray, 828 F.2d\r\n399, 405-06 (7th Cir. 1987).\r\n         Relying on United States v. Parra-Ibanez, supra, 936\r\nF.2d 588, defendant also argues that once the district court\r\njudge learned that she was taking Phenergan with codeine, he\r\nshould have conducted a \"further inquiry\" into her ability to\r\ncomprehend what was transpiring at the change of plea hearing. \r\nIn support of this contention, defendant submits an excerpt\r\nfrom the Physicians' Desk Reference (PDR) concerning Phenergan\r\nwith codeine.  The PDR states that this drug \"may cause marked\r\ndrowsiness or impair the mental and/or physical abilities\r\nrequired for the performance of potentially hazardous tasks,\r\nsuch as driving a vehicle or operating machinery.\"  The PDR\r\nalso states that promethazine, the active ingredient in\r\nPhenergan, can cause \"[s]edation, sleepiness [and] dizziness;\r\nrarely confusion [and] disorientation.\"\r\n         However, unlike the district court judge in Parra-\r\nIbanez, the judge here did ask defendant what effect the\r\nmedicine had on her mental processes.  She responded that she\r\nwas \"fairly coherent.\"  Transcript of Change of Plea Hearing,\r\nat 5.  From this answer, the district court judge was justified\r\nin concluding that she was coherent enough to proceed.  SeeWebster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 445 (1985) (defining\r\n\"fairly\" as \"to a full degree or extent\" or \"for the most\r\npart\").\r\n         Further, after hearing that she was fairly coherent,\r\nthe judge then asked defendant what she was doing at the\r\nhearing.  Transcript of Change of Plea Hearing, at 5. \r\nDefendant answered that she was pleading guilty.  Id.  This\r\nkind of open-ended question is an additional way to test a\r\ndefendant's mental alertness.  Finally, the information in the\r\nPDR suggests that while sedation can occur with the drug\r\ndefendant was using, confusion \"rarely\" occurs and a person's\r\nmental abilities might be compromised only to the extent of\r\nhaving difficulty operating hazardous machinery.  The PDR does\r\nnot warn that a person's abilities to comprehend and reason may\r\nbe affected by codeine and promethazine.\r\n         Defendant's final objection to the plea hearing is\r\nwithout merit.  Specifically, she points out that most of the\r\njudge's questions were leading; that is, she was required to\r\ngive only \"yes\" or \"no\" answers to the questions.  However,\r\ndefendant fails to specify any particular point of confusion or\r\nerror.  Further, the charges were not complex and, as we\r\nindicated above, defendant had the capacity to understand what\r\nwas transpiring at the plea hearing.  Thus, this case is\r\ncontrolled by United States v. Isom, 85 F.3d 831 (1st Cir.\r\n1996), and the use of leading questions was proper.\r\n\n    2.  Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.\r\n    Defendant also argues that her guilty plea should be\r\nvacated due to the ineffective assistance of her trial\r\nattorney.  However, unlike the question of the validity of the\r\nguilty plea itself, which could be resolved on the basis of the\r\ndistrict court record, resolution of this issue requires\r\nfurther factual development.  Thus, a collateral proceeding\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.  2255 is the proper forum for this claim.  SeeUnited States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 353 (1st Cir.\r\n1997) (a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be\r\nbrought in a  2255 motion if the record is insufficiently\r\ndeveloped for direct review).\r\n         The judgment of the district court is summarilyaffirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.\n",
