In  this  case,  one  of  the\r\n\nparticipants in  a  pending divorce  action has  invoked  the\r\n\nfederal racketeering statute to challenge asset transfers  by\r\n\nher spouse.   The district court responded by dismissing  the\r\n\ncomplaint without prejudice  on abstention grounds.   Because\r\n\ndismissal  was on  the  pleadings,  we assume  the  truth  of\r\n\nstatements in the complaint, cautioning that they have yet to\r\n\nbe proved.\r\n\n     Annette and Joseph DeMauro were married in 1979.  Joseph\r\n\nworked \r                  in \r                     the construction business and, according to Annette,\r\n\nearned \"millions of dollars,\" promising to share monies  with\r\n\nAnnette.  But  the marriage proved  less successful than  his\r\n\nbusiness.  The couple separated, and in 1994, Annette--a  New\r\n\nHampshire resident--sued for  divorce in New Hampshire  state\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n     The divorce  action  has  been a  bitter  and  prolonged\r\n\ncontest.  At various times, Joseph has refused to pay spousal\r\n\nsupport \r                   orders (which total more than $250,000), has failed to\r\n\nappear for court proceedings, has resisted discovery requests\r\n\nconcerning his income and property interests by invoking  the\r\n\nFifth \r                 Amendment, \r                            and \r                               has \r                                   been held in contempt of court.  After\r\n\nmore than two years, the divorce action remains unresolved.\r\n\n     In \r                   May \r                       1996, \r                            Annette \r                                    filed the instant suit in the federal\r\n\ndistrict court in Massachusetts.  The complaint named  Joseph\r\n\nand \r               five \r                    other defendants:  Joseph's 42-year-old son, Nicholas\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nDeMauro; Joseph's sister and brother-in-law, Joan and  Edwar\r\n\n                       ons allegedly controlled by Joseph and\r\n\n icholas--DeM\r                        auro Co., Inc. and Tri-Area Development Co., Inc.\r\n\nJoseph\r                                                                        d\r            Martin; \r                   and \r                      two \r                          corporati\r            N      was alleged  to have a residence in Massachusetts  and\r\n\nboth corporations had offices in the state.\r\n\n     The \r                    complaint \r                              set \r                                 forth \r                                       a RICO claim for civil conspiracy,\r\n\n18 U.S.C. S 1961  et seq., specifying predicate  racketeering\r\n\nacts of (1) mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. S 1341, (2) wire fraud,  18\r\n\nU.S.C. S  1343,  and (3)  \"extortionate threats,\"  18  U.S.C.\r\n\nS 1951.  The complaint also alleged pendent state-law claims1\r\n\nfor intentional infliction  of emotional distress, breach  of\r\n\nfiduciary \r                     duty, \r                          conspiracy, fraudulent conveyances, and illegal\r\n\ntelephone recordings.\r\n\n     In \r                   support \r                           of the RICO claim, the complaint charged inter\r\n\nalia  that  Joseph  and  the  other  defendants  fraudulently\r\n\nconcealed \r                     from \r                         Annette \r                                 separate and marital property to prevent\r\n\nher \r               from \r                    sharing in these assets.  Annette alleged that Joseph\r\n\nand the other defendants\r\n\n     by means of  false pretenses, representations,  and\r\n     devices established bank and investment accounts in\r\n     Switzerland,    [the]    Middle    East,    France,\r\n     Liechtenstein, several states of the United  States\r\n     and \r                    various \r                            and sundry other locations most of which\r\n     accounts \r                         were established under the names of straws,\r\n     sham   trusts,    shell   companies    and    phony\r\n\n  \r              \r               \r                \r                1\r                 Diversity \r                          jurisdict\r                                   ion was not available because although\r\nJoseph \r                  is \r                     apparently not a New Hampshire resident, Annette and\r\nthe Martins are New  Hampshire residents, thus defeating  the\r\ncomplete \r                    diversity \r                             requirement.  Casas Office Machines, Inc. v.\r\nMita \r                Copystar America, Inc., 42 F.3d 668, 673 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\n     \"foundations,\r                             \" all designed to conceal the location,\r\n     extent, and existence of assets from [Annette]  and\r\n     persons with whom [Joseph] did business.\r\n\n     The  alleged activity  was undertaken  not by  Annette's\r\n\nhusband \r                   alone, \r                          but \r                             also \r                                  by others who comprised an alleged RICO\r\n\n\"enterprise,\" and it  involves alleged concealments \"well  in\r\n\nexcess \r                  of \r                     a \r                       million dollars.\"  And, allegedly, Joseph not only\r\n\nthreatened to deprive Annette of assets but also boasted that\r\n\nhe had  bribed foreign officials  to secure  himself a  false\r\n\nidentity and foreign passport.\r\n\n     In June 1996, all the defendants except Joseph moved  to\r\n\ndismiss \r                   the \r                       suit \r                           on \r                              various grounds, including lack of standing\r\n\nto \r              bring \r                    RICO claims and failure to plead fraud with requisite\r\n\nparticularity, \r                          Fed. \r                              R. \r                                 Civ. P. 9(b).  Joseph did not join these\r\n\nmotions because he  had not yet been served process,  despite\r\n\nefforts \r                   by \r                      Annette \r                             to \r                                locate and serve him.  Joseph was finally\r\n\nserved  with process  while  appearing involuntarily  in  New\r\n\nHampshire state court, having been arrested and brought there\r\n\nfor a hearing on his failure to pay ordered spousal support.\r\n\n     On July 26, 1996, the district judge issued a seven-page\r\n\norder. \r                   \r                   He \r                     expressed \r                               doubt whether Annette had shown a property\r\n\ninterest protectible  under the  civil RICO  statute; but  he\r\n\nultimately did  not decide this  issue and instead  dismissed\r\n\nwithout \r                   prejudice Annette's claims against all the defendants.\r\n\nThe dismissal  was  based  upon the  doctrine  of  abstention\r\n\nestablished in Burford v.  Sun Oil Co., 319 U.S. 315  (1943).\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nRather  than  staying  the  federal  proceedings,  the  court\r\n\ndismissed, noting that Annette could\r\n\n     replead if and when she can show a \"property\" right\r\n     which . . . has been denied her by the  defendants'\r\n     allegedly  illegal transfers--that  is,  after  the\r\n     resolution of the divorce action and the  attendant\r\n     allocation of marital assets.\r\n\n     The  parties  had  not  addressed  the  possibility   of\r\n\nabstention \r                      in \r                        their \r                              filings.  In August 1996, Annette moved for\r\n\nreconsideration, arguing that  abstention was not proper  and\r\n\nthat, if it  were proper, the  court should stay  proceedings\r\n\nrather \r                  than \r                      dismissing \r                                 the action.  The court denied her motion\r\n\nwithout comment.  Annette now appeals.\r\n\n     1.  For reasons that will become evident, we begin  with\r\n\nthe threshold issue bypassed  by the district court,  namely,\r\n\nwhether the plaintiff has made out a claim of \"injury\" to her\r\n\n\"business \r                     or \r                       property,\" \r                                  as is required for a civil RICO damages\r\n\naction.  18 U.S.C. S 1964(c).  This is sometimes described as\r\n\na \"standing\" issue.   There is plainly a case or  controversy\r\n\nunder \r                 Article III; but the statutory precondition of injury to\r\n\nbusiness or property must  also be met.  Sedima, S.P.R.L.  v.\r\n\nImrex Co., 473 U.S. 479, 496 (1985).\r\n\n     One  might think  it obvious  that a  precondition in  a\r\n\nfederal \r                   statute \r                           would \r                                be \r                                   defined uniformly by federal law.  Cf.\r\n\nAgency Holding Corp. v. Malley-Duff &amp; Assoc., Inc., 483  U.S.\r\n\n143, 147-49 (1987) (civil RICO statute of limitations).  This\r\n\nis especially so where the same phrase--injury to business or\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nproperty--is also a long-standing requirement under section 4\r\n\nof  the  Clayton Act,  15  U.S.C. S  15(a).   Yet,  the  RICO\r\n\nprecedents are filled with references to state property  law,\r\n\nwhich is  often said to  govern by implicit  cross-reference.\r\n\nE.g., Doe v. Roe, 958  F.2d 763, 768 (7th Cir. 1992)  (citing\r\n\ncases).\r\n\n     Some role does exist for state law.  There is no general\r\n\nfederal law of property transfers, so the question who owns a\r\n\npiece \r                 of \r                    property \r                            is \r                               likely to be settled by state law.  On the\r\n\nother hand, one might expect federal law to decide whether  a\r\n\ngiven \r                 interest, recognized by state law, rises to the level of\r\n\n\"business \r                     or \r                       property,\" \r                                  or whether \"injury\" has been done to it\r\n\nby \r              the \r                  acts \r                       alleged.2  Where to set the \"business or property\"\r\n\nthreshold  depends on  federal  statutory purpose,  and  that\r\n\npurpose is  likely to support  a definition  that is  uniform\r\n\nthroughout the country.\r\n\n     In all events, the assets that Annette ultimately claims\r\n\nto have been concealed are \"property\" by any definition:  the\r\n\ncomplaint \r                     alleges fraudulent concealment and transfers of real\r\n\nproperty \r                    and \r                        bank account funds by Joseph.  One difficulty--so\r\n\nfar as we can tell from the undeveloped record--is that  most\r\n\n(perhaps all)  of this property may  have been held from  the\r\n\n  \r              \r               \r                \r                2\r                 E.g.\r                     , \r                       A\r                        ssociated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v.\r\nCalifornia State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519,  529-45\r\n(1983) (examining the meaning of \"injury\" under section 4  of\r\nthe Clayton Act); compare Roma Constr. Co. v. aRusso, 96 F.3d\r\n566, 579-80 n.10 (1st Cir. 1996) (Lynch, J., concurring).\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\noutset in  Joseph's name  or in the  name of  others such  as\r\n\nfoundations \r                       that he controls.  The complaint also implies that\r\n\nmost \r                (perhaps all) of the underlying assets were the result of\r\n\nthe success of Joseph's construction business.\r\n\n     New \r                    Hampshire \r                              is \r                                not \r                                    a \r                                      community property state, see Baker\r\n\nv. \r              Baker\r                   , \r                     421 A.2d 998, 1000 (N.H. 1980), and much of the real\r\n\nproperty and monies described in the complaint may not yet be\r\n\nAnnette's property.  To  this extent, what Annette has is  an\r\n\nexpectancy:  in the divorce proceedings, some or much of this\r\n\nproperty may be awarded  to Annette.  State law provides  for\r\n\n\"equitable division\" in divorce actions of \"all tangible  and\r\n\nintangible property and assets  . . . belonging to either  or\r\n\nboth \r                parties, \r                        whether \r                                title to the property is held in the name\r\n\nof either or both parties.\"  N.H.

In sum, any claim of present \"injury\" to\r\n\nher \r               claim \r                     is \r                        speculative, so long as we are concerned with the\r\n\nmovement  of real property  or cash that  for now belongs  to\r\n\nJoseph.\r\n\n     Pertinent here  is a  decision of  this court  upholding\r\n\ndismissal of  a civil RICO claim  brought by a plaintiff  who\r\n\nalleged injury based on a \"hypothetical inability to recover\"\r\n\nif it won its pending contract lawsuit against the defendant.\r\n\nThe \r               defendant \r                        had \r                            allegedly made fraudulent transfers of assets\r\n\nto his wife; but we held that the RICO claim was not ripe for\r\n\nadjudication because the claimed injury was too  speculative.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                         -8-\r\r\n\nLincoln  House, Inc. v.

But while RICO  is to be construed  broadly,\r\n\nSedima, 473  U.S. at  498,  \"injury to  property\" is  not  an\r\n\ninfinitely \r                      elastic \r                             concept.

However, the complaint also asserts that Joseph  has\r\n\nsought to conceal  \"marital\" or \"separate\" property.

Still,  on  the  present  pleadings  the\r\n\npossibility remains  that Annette  already owns  some of  the\r\n\nproperty allegedly concealed  by Joseph and others.  On  that\r\n\npremise, we turn to the issue of abstention.\r\n\n     2. \r                    \r                    We \r                       note \r                           at \r                              the \r                                  start \r                                        that the district court's remedy-\r\n\n-dismissal \r                      on \r                        abstention \r                                   grounds--is not permissible.

But the Court further held\r\n\nthat in a damages action, the district court may only order a\r\n\nstay \r                pending \r                        resolution of state proceedings; it cannot invoke\r\n\nabstention to dismiss the suit altogether.  Id.\r\n\n     The rationale of  Quackenbush is  that damages  actions,\r\n\nunlike suits for equitable relief, do not invoke the  court's\r\n\nequitable \r                     discretion.

There  is no question that  the present RICO claim  is\r\n\nprimarily a damages action.  See complaint, qq 62-67.  It  is\r\n\nuncertain \r                     whether \r                            equitable relief is even available to private\r\n\nplaintiffs under civil RICO.  Lincoln House, 903 F.2d at 848.\r\n\n     The  question remains  whether  the district  court  has\r\n\nauthority \r                     at \r                        least \r                             to \r                                stay Annette's federal suit on abstention\r\n\ngrounds,  pending resolution  of  the New  Hampshire  divorce\r\n\nproceeding.    In that  proceeding,  the  state  court  might\r\n\ndetermine what property  is currently owned by Annette.   See\r\n\nN.H. \r                Rev. \r                     Stat. Ann. S 458:16-a(II).  For this reason, another\r\n\ndistrict court--cited by the district court in this case--has\r\n\nabstained \r                     from adjudicating a federal RICO action brought by a\r\n\nspouse involved  in pending divorce  proceedings.

And, the\r\n\nSupreme Court has discouraged abstention based solely on  the\r\n\nground that a related state court action may address  similar\r\n\nissues,  Colorado River  Water Conservation  Dist. v.  United\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                        -11-\r\r\n\nStates\r                 , \r                   424 \r                      U.S. \r                           800, \r                                817 (1976), with only limited exceptions,\r\n\ne.g., Railroad Comm'n of  Texas v. Pullman Co., 312 U.S.  496\r\n\n(1941). \r\n\n     A more  plausible basis for  abstention is the  possible\r\n\ninterference \r                        that a civil RICO action at this time might cause\r\n\nto the state court's decision as to how to divide property in\r\n\nthe divorce.  The so-called domestic relations exception does\r\n\nnot preclude federal  courts from  adjudicating tort  actions\r\n\nmerely \r                  because the parties were married and are in the process\r\n\nof \r              divorce. \r                        \r                        Ankenbrandt\r                                   \r                                   v.

Suppose  Annette were awarded  the value (or  three\r\n\ntimes \r                 the \r                     value) \r                           of \r                              disputed jointly owned property in the RICO\r\n\ncase \r                and \r                    the \r                       state \r                             court \r                                   then determined that the same property\r\n\nought to be allocated to Joseph.  At the very least, there is\r\n\na    possibility     of    conflict    between     judgments,\r\n\n      requiring one of them to be modified to take account of\r\n\nthe other.

The federal court's ability to reach\r\n\nand freeze out-of-state property may well be greater than the\r\n\nNew Hampshire  divorce court's.   At the  same time,  interim\r\n\nallocations of property are standard fare for divorce courts,\r\n\nand the obvious potential for interference with this function\r\n\nis an extremely serious matter.\r\n\n     Our \r                    case, \r                          and those kinds of threatened interference, are\r\n\nnot a  perfect fit  with the  Burford doctrine.

Such state court\r\n\nauthority \r                     would be threatened if civil RICO actions become the\r\n\nshadow proceeding for policing such disputes.\r\n\n     We conclude  that abstention  by use  of a  stay may  be\r\n\npermissible \r                       where \r                             a \r                              RICO \r                                   action is directed against concealment\r\n\nor transfer of property that is the very subject of a pending\r\n\ndivorce \r                   proceeding. \r                                \r                               The \r                                   divorce proceedings might or might not\r\n\nresolve  the   federal  dispute--there   are  many   possible\r\n\npermutations and plenty of  unanswered legal questions.   But\r\n\nstaying  the federal  RICO  claim  will reduce  the  risk  of\r\n\ninterfering  with interim  state allocations  and permit  the\r\n\nfederal court to  tailor any final federal judgment to  avoid\r\n\nundermining the divorce court's allocation of property.  \r\n\n     3.  While  abstention may be  permissible, it cannot  be\r\n\nautomatic in  a case  of this kind.   A  decision to  abstain\r\n\nrequires not only that certain preconditions be met, but also\r\n\nthat \r                the \r                    district \r                            court \r                                  reasonably find that such abstention is\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                        -14-\r\r\n\nappropriate in the case at hand.6  Of course, this may not be\r\n\nmuch of an issue when the particular abstention rubric itself\r\n\n resumes \r                    stro\r\n\ndefendant  seeks a  federal  injunction interfering  with  an\r\n\nongoing state criminal trial.  Younger, 401 U.S. at 45, 54.\r\n\n     Cases \r                      like \r                           the \r                              present \r                                      one differ markedly from situations\r\n\nlike Younger.  Not only  do we have far less experience  with\r            p           ngly in favor of abstention--for example, where a\r\n\ncivil  RICO actions  that  overlap divorce  proceedings,  but\r\n\nextreme \r                   variations can be imagined both as to underlying facts\r\n\nand equitable concerns.  Certainly in some instances a  civil\r\n\nRICO claim  might be  so plausible  and so  distinct from  an\r\n\nordinary divorce action property dispute as to undermine  any\r\n\nargument for a  stay; or even if  a trial were stayed,  there\r\n\nmight be a compelling argument for interim relief to  protect\r\n\nthe plaintiff's right to ultimate relief in the RICO action.\r\n\n     In  sum,  abstention  here is  a  possible,  but  not  a\r\n\nmechanical \r                      answer. \r                               \r                              The \r                                  district court's judgment cannot stand,\r\n\nsimply \r                  because it conflicts with Quackenbush.  Nor do we think\r\n\nthat  the  dismissal on  abstention  grounds  can  simply  be\r\n\ntransformed into  a stay;  such a stay  might in  the end  be\r\n\nequitably justifiable, but not  without giving the parties  a\r\n\n     6See Quackenbush, 116 S.

Friends  of\r\n\nChildren, Inc., 766 F.2d at 37.\r\n\n     The district  court  has  no obligation  to  pursue  the\r\n\nabstention issue at all if the matter can be disposed of more\r\n\nappropriately on other grounds.  Motions to dismiss have been\r\n\nmade for  lack of standing  (an issue  discussed above),  for\r\n\nfailure to  plead  fraud with  particularity, and  for  other\r\n\nreasons.   Possibly,  further  exploration will  reveal  that\r\n\nAnnette \r                   has \r                       no standing as to any of the property in question.\r\n\nIn all  events, the order  in which to  consider issues is  a\r\n\nmatter for the district judge.\r\n\n     The treatment  of the pendent  state claims depends,  in\r\n\nturn, on the outcome of the inquiries just described.

See 28 U.S.C. S 1367(c)(3).  If it determines  to\r\n\nstay the  civil RICO claim  on abstention  grounds, then  the\r\n\ntreatment of the  pendent claims is  less clear-cut, see  id.\r\n\nS 1367(c)(4), but the parties have not addressed that  issue,\r\n\nand we express no view upon it.\r\n\n     The judgment of  the district court  is vacated and  the\r\n\nmatter remanded for further proceedings consistent with  this\r\n\ndecision.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                        -17-\r\n",

In  this  case,  one  of  the\r\n\nparticipants in  a  pending divorce  action has  invoked  the\r\n\nfederal racketeering statute to challenge asset transfers  by\r\n\nher spouse.   The district court responded by dismissing  the\r\n\ncomplaint without prejudice  on abstention grounds.   Because\r\n\ndismissal  was on  the  pleadings,  we assume  the  truth  of\r\n\nstatements in the complaint, cautioning that they have yet to\r\n\nbe proved.\r\n\n     Annette and Joseph DeMauro were married in 1979.  Joseph\r\n\nworked \r                  in \r                     the construction business and, according to Annette,\r\n\nearned \"millions of dollars,\" promising to share monies  with\r\n\nAnnette.  But  the marriage proved  less successful than  his\r\n\nbusiness.  The couple separated, and in 1994, Annette--a  New\r\n\nHampshire resident--sued for  divorce in New Hampshire  state\r\n\ncourt.\r\n\n     The divorce  action  has  been a  bitter  and  prolonged\r\n\ncontest.  At various times, Joseph has refused to pay spousal\r\n\nsupport \r                   orders (which total more than $250,000), has failed to\r\n\nappear for court proceedings, has resisted discovery requests\r\n\nconcerning his income and property interests by invoking  the\r\n\nFifth \r                 Amendment, \r                            and \r                               has \r                                   been held in contempt of court.  After\r\n\nmore than two years, the divorce action remains unresolved.\r\n\n     In \r                   May \r                       1996, \r                            Annette \r                                    filed the instant suit in the federal\r\n\ndistrict court in Massachusetts.

They\r\n\ncertainly could be explored through inquiry and discovery and\r\n\ncould be tested,  if doubtful, by a  motion to dismiss or  by\r\n\nsummary  judgment.   Still,  on  the  present  pleadings  the\r\n\npossibility remains  that Annette  already owns  some of  the\r\n\nproperty allegedly concealed  by Joseph and others.  On  that\r\n\npremise, we turn to the issue of abstention.\r\n\n     2. \r                    \r                    We \r                       note \r                           at \r                              the \r                                  start \r                                        that the district court's remedy-\r\n\n-dismissal \r                      on \r                        abstention \r                                   grounds--is not permissible.  Just two\r\n\nmonths \r                  before \r                        the \r                            district court issued its ruling, the Supreme\r\n\nCourt \r                 held \r                      that abstention, under Burford or otherwise, may be\r\n\nappropriate \r                       in \r                          suits \r                               for \r                                   damages.

But the Court further held\r\n\nthat in a damages action, the district court may only order a\r\n\nstay \r                pending \r                        resolution of state proceedings; it cannot invoke\r\n\nabstention to dismiss the suit altogether.  Id.\r\n\n     The rationale of  Quackenbush is  that damages  actions,\r\n\nunlike suits for equitable relief, do not invoke the  court's\r\n\nequitable \r                     discretion.  Id. at 1727.  This rule may seem rather\r\n\nwooden, \r                   given \r                         the \r                            merger \r                                   of law and equity, but the Court means\r\n\nwhat \r                it \r                   says: \r                          \r                         Quackenbus\r                                   h held that the dismissal of a damages\r\n\naction  on Burford  grounds  was  reversible  error,  without\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                        -10-\r\r\n\ndeciding whether \"a more limited abstention-based stay  order\r\n\nwould have been warranted on the facts of this case.\"  Id. at\r\n\n1728.  There  is no question that  the present RICO claim  is\r\n\nprimarily a damages action.  See complaint, qq 62-67.  It  is\r\n\nuncertain \r                     whether \r                            equitable relief is even available to private\r\n\nplaintiffs under civil RICO.  Lincoln House, 903 F.2d at 848.\r\n\n     The  question remains  whether  the district  court  has\r\n\nauthority \r                     at \r                        least \r                             to \r                                stay Annette's federal suit on abstention\r\n\ngrounds,  pending resolution  of  the New  Hampshire  divorce\r\n\nproceeding.    In that  proceeding,  the  state  court  might\r\n\ndetermine what property  is currently owned by Annette.   See\r\n\nN.H. \r                Rev. \r                     Stat. Ann. S 458:16-a(II).  For this reason, another\r\n\ndistrict court--cited by the district court in this case--has\r\n\nabstained \r                     from adjudicating a federal RICO action brought by a\r\n\nspouse involved  in pending divorce  proceedings.

Such state court\r\n\nauthority \r                     would be threatened if civil RICO actions become the\r\n\nshadow proceeding for policing such disputes.\r\n\n     We conclude  that abstention  by use  of a  stay may  be\r\n\npermissible \r                       where \r                             a \r                              RICO \r                                   action is directed against concealment\r\n\nor transfer of property that is the very subject of a pending\r\n\ndivorce \r                   proceeding. \r                                \r                               The \r                                   divorce proceedings might or might not\r\n\nresolve  the   federal  dispute--there   are  many   possible\r\n\npermutations and plenty of  unanswered legal questions.   But\r\n\nstaying  the federal  RICO  claim  will reduce  the  risk  of\r\n\ninterfering  with interim  state allocations  and permit  the\r\n\nfederal court to  tailor any final federal judgment to  avoid\r\n\nundermining the divorce court's allocation of property.  \r\n\n     3.  While  abstention may be  permissible, it cannot  be\r\n\nautomatic in  a case  of this kind.   A  decision to  abstain\r\n\nrequires not only that certain preconditions be met, but also\r\n\nthat \r                the \r                    district \r                            court \r                                  reasonably find that such abstention is\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                        -14-\r\r\n\nappropriate in the case at hand.6  Of course, this may not be\r\n\nmuch of an issue when the particular abstention rubric itself\r\n\n resumes \r                    stro\r\n\ndefendant  seeks a  federal  injunction interfering  with  an\r\n\nongoing state criminal trial.  Younger, 401 U.S. at 45, 54.\r\n\n     Cases \r                      like \r                           the \r                              present \r                                      one differ markedly from situations\r\n\nlike Younger.  Not only  do we have far less experience  with\r            p           ngly in favor of abstention--for example, where a\r\n\ncivil  RICO actions  that  overlap divorce  proceedings,  but\r\n\nextreme \r                   variations can be imagined both as to underlying facts\r\n\nand equitable concerns.  Certainly in some instances a  civil\r\n\nRICO claim  might be  so plausible  and so  distinct from  an\r\n\nordinary divorce action property dispute as to undermine  any\r\n\nargument for a  stay; or even if  a trial were stayed,  there\r\n\nmight be a compelling argument for interim relief to  protect\r\n\nthe plaintiff's right to ultimate relief in the RICO action.\r\n\n     In  sum,  abstention  here is  a  possible,  but  not  a\r\n\nmechanical \r                      answer. \r                               \r                              The \r                                  district court's judgment cannot stand,\r\n\nsimply \r                  because it conflicts with Quackenbush.  Nor do we think\r\n\nthat  the  dismissal on  abstention  grounds  can  simply  be\r\n\ntransformed into  a stay;  such a stay  might in  the end  be\r\n\nequitably justifiable, but not  without giving the parties  a\r\n\n     6See Quackenbush, 116 S.

Friends  of\r\n\nChildren, Inc., 766 F.2d at 37.\r\n\n     The district  court  has  no obligation  to  pursue  the\r\n\nabstention issue at all if the matter can be disposed of more\r\n\nappropriately on other grounds.  Motions to dismiss have been\r\n\nmade for  lack of standing  (an issue  discussed above),  for\r\n\nfailure to  plead  fraud with  particularity, and  for  other\r\n\nreasons.   Possibly,  further  exploration will  reveal  that\r\n\nAnnette \r                   has \r                       no standing as to any of the property in question.\r\n\nIn all  events, the order  in which to  consider issues is  a\r\n\nmatter for the district judge.\r\n\n     The treatment  of the pendent  state claims depends,  in\r\n\nturn, on the outcome of the inquiries just described.  If the\r\n\ndistrict  court finds  no  basis for  a  claim of  injury  to\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                        -16-\r\r\n\nproperty, \r                     presumably \r                               it \r                                  will dismiss the pendent claims without\r\n\nprejudice.  See 28 U.S.C. S 1367(c)(3).  If it determines  to\r\n\nstay the  civil RICO claim  on abstention  grounds, then  the\r\n\ntreatment of the  pendent claims is  less clear-cut, see  id.\r\n\nS 1367(c)(4), but the parties have not addressed that  issue,\r\n\nand we express no view upon it.\r\n\n     The judgment of  the district court  is vacated and  the\r\n\nmatter remanded for further proceedings consistent with  this\r\n\ndecision.\r\n\n     It is so ordered.\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                        -17-\r\n</pre>",
