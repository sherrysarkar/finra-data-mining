Gibson,   of   the   Eighth   Circuit,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.           Manuel García-Guzmán and his\n\nwife, Maria Emilia García-Urgüelles, appeal from the order of\n\nthe   district   court   granting    summary    judgment   in     favor   of\n\nappellees, the Villoldos.      The district court determined that\n\nGarcía-Guzmán's1 claim of wrongful attachment was barred by the\n\none-year statute of limitations set forth in Article 1868 of the\n\nCivil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 L.P.R.A. § 5298.                    The court\n\nreasoned that García-Guzmán was not a party to the proceeding in\n\nwhich his property was attached, and therefore he should not\n\nhave waited for the entry of a final judgment in the underlying\n\nlitigation before filing his wrongful attachment action.                  We\n\nreview the grant of summary judgment de novo, see Megwinoff v.\n\nBanco Bilbao Vizcaya, 233 F.3d 73, 74 (1st Cir. 2000), and\n\nconclude that the district court's application of the statute of\n\nlimitations was erroneous.\n\n                                    I.\n\n          This case arises out of a dispute between the Villoldos\n\nand   García-Guzmán's    parents,    the    Garcías,   over   a    business\n\njointly owned by the two families.           In 1991, the relationship\n\nbetween the families soured, and they filed lawsuits against\n\n\n\n      1In the interests of clarity and brevity, we omit any\nfurther references to García-Guzmán's wife, appellant García-\nUrgüelles.  Our holding is, of course, equally applicable to\nher.\n\n                                    -3-\n\feach other (the “1991 Cases”).           The 1991 Cases were consolidated\n\nand assigned to Judge Fusté.           García-Guzmán was not named as a\n\nparty in either case.\n\n            Eventually, the Garcías and the Villoldos agreed to\n\nsettle their differences.         On September 18, 1992, they executed\n\nan agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) providing that the\n\nGarcías would buy the Villoldos' stock in the business for\n\n$650,000, to be paid in a series of installments.              García-Guzmán\n\njoined his parents in signing the Settlement Agreement, although\n\nit was not then clear in what capacity he signed.                 The terms of\n\nthe   Settlement     Agreement    were     incorporated    into    a   judgment\n\ndisposing of the 1991 Cases (the “1992 Judgment”).\n\n            Although the Garcías began to make the agreed-upon\n\npayments,    they    defaulted       after   paying   slightly      more   than\n\n$150,000.     Invoking       Judge    Fusté's   continuing     authority     to\n\nenforce the 1992 Judgment, the Villoldos initiated attachment\n\nproceedings against the Garcías in March, 1994, but the action\n\nwas   suspended     when   the   Garcías     filed   for   bankruptcy.      The\n\nVilloldos then turned to García-Guzmán for satisfaction of the\n\ndebt.   On September 14, 1994, they obtained an order from Judge\n\nFusté authorizing the attachment of García-Guzmán's personal\n\nproperty.    Instead of executing the attachment, however, the\n\nVilloldos   filed     a    separate   action    against    García-Guzmán     on\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fNovember 19, 1994, alleging breach of contract and seeking to\n\nenforce the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement\n\n(the “1994 Action”).   Leaving aside details not relevant here,\n\nthe crux of the Villoldos' claim was that García-Guzmán was a\n\nfull signatory to the Settlement Agreement, jointly responsible\n\nfor his parents' debt to the Villoldos.   García-Guzmán moved to\n\ndismiss the complaint on the ground that he had not assumed any\n\nobligation to purchase the Villoldos' stock.   Emphasizing that\n\nhe was not a party to the 1991 Cases that gave rise to the\n\nSettlement Agreement, García-Guzmán argued that he had signed\n\nthe Agreement only in his representative capacity as manager of\n\nthe business being sold (which was a party in the 1991 Cases),\n\nand that he was obligated in a personal capacity only with\n\nrespect to a non-compete covenant set forth in the Agreement.\n\n         The district court never addressed the merits of those\n\narguments, ruling instead that the Villoldos' claim against\n\nGarcía-Guzmán should have been addressed to Judge Fusté in the\n\nform of a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement.   The court\n\nreasoned that, since the terms of the Settlement Agreement were\n\nincorporated into the 1992 Judgment, a breach of the Agreement\n\nwould be a violation of the Judgment itself.     Therefore, the\n\ncourt concluded, Judge Fusté retained jurisdiction over the 1991\n\nCases to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement.   Rather\n\n\n                              -5-\n\fthan dismiss the Villoldos' complaint against García-Guzmán,\n\nhowever, the court simply consolidated the 1994 Action with the\n\n1991 Cases and transferred it to Judge Fusté.\n\n          On April 19, 1995, Judge Fusté dismissed the 1994\n\nAction.   In an order entered the same day, he explained his\n\nruling:\n\n          The 1994 suit is not a separate claim. It\n          only involves a claim for execution of\n          judgment which results from the earlier\n          judgment in the two consolidated cases [the\n          1991 Cases]. . . . The 1994 civil action is\n          duplicitous and there is no reason, legal or\n          otherwise, for it to be litigated separately\n          as an independent civil action.\n\nJudge Fusté apparently believed that García-Guzmán already was\n\na party to the 1991 Cases – at least for enforcement purposes –\n\nby virtue of his participation in the Settlement Agreement and\n\nthe incorporation of that Agreement into the 1992 Judgment.\n\nThus, there was no need for a separate action against him.              Any\n\nobligation   García-Guzmán      owed    to   the   Villoldos    under   the\n\nSettlement Agreement could be enforced by post-judgment motions\n\nfor execution of the 1992 Judgment.\n\n          As the Villoldos recognized, Judge Fusté determined\n\nimplicitly   in   his   order   that    García-Guzmán    was,    in   fact,\n\nresponsible for his parents' debt.           Accordingly, the Villoldos\n\nproceeded to execute the writ of attachment issued the previous\n\nSeptember against García-Guzmán's personal property.              On June\n\n                                  -6-\n\f21, 1995, they attached $6,862 held in his bank account.           They\n\nalso obtained (but did not execute) a second writ of attachment\n\nagainst García-Guzmán, this time authorizing the attachment of\n\nhis real property.\n\n          García-Guzmán immediately filed an emergency motion\n\nseeking   return    of   the   attached   bank   funds.   Judge   Fusté\n\ninitially responded on July 5, 1995, with the following margin\n\norder:\n\n          The court has examined – once again – the\n          settlement   agreement   and  it   can   be\n          interpreted as we did earlier to the effect\n          that García-Guzmán joined his parents in\n          guaranteeing the payment of the stipulated\n          accounts. The motion for execution was duly\n          notified and this appears to be a late\n          opposition to it.      The Villoldos will\n          express their views in not more than 10\n          pages . . . .\n\nThen, in an order entered on January 31, 1996, Judge Fusté\n\ndenied García-Guzmán's request for return of the attached bank\n\nfunds on the ground that García-Guzmán was obligated by the\n\nterms of the Settlement Agreement and the 1992 Judgment to\n\nsatisfy the debt owed to the Villoldos.\n\n          García-Guzmán appealed, and we held in an unpublished\n\nopinion that the Settlement Agreement was ambiguous as to the\n\nextent of his responsibility for the debt to the Villoldos.\n\nGarcía-Guzmán v. Villoldo, No. 96-1215 (1st Cir. Feb. 14, 1997)\n\n(unpublished).     Accordingly, we vacated the January 31 order and\n\n                                   -7-\n\fremanded for a factual inquiry into the parties' intent.                  Judge\n\nFusté held an evidentiary hearing and, based on the evidence\n\npresented there, determined that García-Guzmán “was asked to\n\nsign, not as a full guarantor, but only in reference to the\n\ncovenant not to compete.”          Therefore, he concluded, “the orders\n\nthat were originally entered against Mr. García Guzmán for\n\nexecution of judgment should be, for all purposes, vacated.”                 On\n\nFebruary 1, 1999, Judge Fusté entered judgment “dismissing the\n\ncomplaint” against García-Guzmán.           The Villoldos did not appeal.\n\n            On June 15, 1999, García-Guzmán filed the instant\n\ndiversity    action      for   wrongful      attachment       and   malicious\n\nprosecution, seeking damages allegedly caused by the attachment\n\nof his bank account and the order of attachment obtained – but\n\nnever   executed    –    against    his   real    property.      The   parties\n\nconsented to proceed before a magistrate judge.                See 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 636(c).    Several months later, they filed cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment on the claim of wrongful attachment.                      The\n\nVilloldos argued, as relevant here, that the claim was time-\n\nbarred because García-Guzmán's complaint was filed more than one\n\nyear after the date on which he became aware of the relevant\n\nattachments.       The    magistrate      judge   agreed,     reasoning   that\n\nGarcía-Guzmán was not a party to the 1991 Cases, and therefore\n\nthe “applicable statute of limitations is one year from the day\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f[on] which [García-Guzmán] knew of the attachment (i.e., June of\n\n1995).”    The judge rejected García-Guzmán's argument that he had\n\nbeen “brought into” the 1991 Cases in 1994, when the Villoldos\n\nobtained authorization to attach his property to enforce the\n\n1992 Judgment. “[T]hroughout all the proceedings,” he pointed\n\nout, “García-Guzmán has argued that he was not a party to the\n\noriginal litigation, and in fact, on the basis of that argument\n\nhe was able to avoid liability under the settlement agreement.”\n\nThus, the judge concluded, the fact that Judge Fusté's February\n\n1, 1999, judgment purported to “dismiss” a “complaint” against\n\nGarcía-Guzmán was immaterial.          The only complaint ever filed\n\nagainst García-Guzmán was in connection with the 1994 Action,\n\nand was dismissed in April 1995 – before the Villoldos attached\n\nGarcía-Guzmán's personal property, and long before Judge Fusté's\n\ndecision in 1999.\n\n            The magistrate judge granted the Villoldos' motion for\n\nsummary    judgment    on      García-Guzmán's    claim   of    wrongful\n\nattachment.     García-Guzmán then obtained a voluntary dismissal\n\nof   his   remaining   claim    of   malicious   prosecution,   and   the\n\nmagistrate judge entered judgment dismissing the complaint in\n\nits entirety.    This appeal followed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            Claims of wrongful attachment are subject to a one-year\n\nstatute    of    limitations         applicable      to   all    actions      for\n\n“obligations arising from . . . fault or negligence.”                          31\n\nL.P.R.A. § 5298.         The timing of the statute of limitations\n\ndepends    on   when    the    substantive    elements    of    the   claim   are\n\npresent.    Thus, before we can address the statute of limitations\n\nquestion in this case, we need to understand what, in general,\n\nmakes an attachment “wrongful” under Puerto Rico law, and how\n\nsuch wrongfulness ordinarily is established.               We then can apply\n\nthose general principles to the facts here to determine when the\n\nstatute of limitations began to run on García-Guzmán's claim.\n\n            Rule 56 of the Puerto Rico Rules of Civil Procedure\n\nprovides that the plaintiff in any action may move, before or\n\nafter judgment is entered, for a provisional attachment of the\n\ndefendant's property to “secure satisfaction of the judgment.”\n\n32   L.P.R.A.    App.    III    R.   56.1.     The    validity    of   such    an\n\nattachment depends on the validity of the plaintiff's claim\n\nagainst the defendant-attachee.              If the court determines that\n\nthe plaintiff's claim against the defendant has no merit, it\n\nfollows that she has no right to the defendant's property, and\n\nthat the attachment was unwarranted.              The plaintiff then may be\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fliable    to    the   defendant     for        the     damages     caused          by   the\n\nattachment.2\n\n            Liability for a wrongful attachment is based on Article\n\n1802 of the Civil Code, which provides that “[a] person who by\n\nan act or omission causes damage to another through fault or\n\nnegligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.”                               31\n\nL.P.R.A. § 5141.       A wrongful attachment claim, therefore, has\n\nthree elements:       an act or omission, damages, and “fault or\n\nnegligence.”     The first two elements are fairly straightforward.\n\nThe   relevant     “act”   is     the    attachment         of     the       defendant's\n\nproperty,      and,   as   Rule    56    recognizes,          even       a    temporary\n\nattachment can cause damage.              The defendant's credit may be\n\nadversely      affected;   his    business           may   fail;    he       may    suffer\n\nemotional distress.        See, e.g., Feliciano v. Mercantil Cedeño,\n\n\n\n      2\n      In the usual case, Rule 56 requires a plaintiff seeking to\nattach a defendant's property to file a bond “sufficient to\nsecure all the damages arising from” the attachment.          32\nL.P.R.A. App. III R. 56.3.    However, the bond requirement is\nwaived in cases where it seems especially likely that the\nplaintiff does, in fact, have a valid claim against the\ndefendant and his property. Thus, Rule 56.3 provides that the\nplaintiff may obtain an attachment without bond if, inter alia,\nthe plaintiff alleges under oath that the defendant owes her a\nlegally enforceable obligation, or – as is the case here – the\nattachment “is sought after judgment is entered.” In those\ncircumstances, the absence of a protective bond means that the\nplaintiff is directly liable for any damages sustained by the\ndefendant in the event that the attachment is deemed wrongful.\nSee M. Quilichini Sucrs., Inc. v. Villa Inv. Corp., 12 P.R.\nOffic. Trans. 401, 406, 408 (1982).\n\n                                        -11-\n\fS. en C., 85 P.R.R. 138 (1962) (recognizing that damages are\n\navailable to owner of business wrongfully attached for damages\n\ncaused to good name of business and for mental anguish and moral\n\ndamages suffered by owner).\n\n           The third element – that the damage was caused by the\n\nattaching party's “fault or negligence” – is more complicated.\n\nIn the usual case, the question whether the attachment was\n\n“wrongful”   is   answered   by   reference   to    the   outcome   of   the\n\ndispute    between   the   parties.      If   the    plaintiff-attachor\n\nprevailed, it follows that the attachment was warranted and the\n\ndefendant-attachee has no cause for complaint.              On the other\n\nhand, a judgment in favor of the defendant-attachee establishes\n\nthat the plaintiff had no valid claim against the defendant or\n\nhis property, and, consequently, that the attachment was in\n\nerror.    As the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has explained:\n\n           [T]here is no doubt that a person is guilty\n           of fault who, to secure the result of an\n           action which he is prosecuting against a\n           specific person, requests and obtains of the\n           court the attachment of the property of his\n           adversary,   which   attachment   afterward,\n           either through improper preparation of the\n           complaint or owing to the said complaint\n           being groundless or frivolous, must be\n           dissolved, after having caused considerable\n           damage and prejudice to the credit or\n           interests of the owner of the property\n           attached.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\fCintrón v. Insular Indus. & Agric. Exposition Ass'n, Inc., 58\n\nP.R.R. 820, 825 (1941) (quoting Lowande v.                    Otero & Co., 14\n\nP.R.R. 544 (1908)).\n\n              Thus, in order to prove that the damages arising out\n\nof an attachment were caused by the attaching party's “fault or\n\nnegligence,”          the   attachee    typically     must   show,    at   a    bare\n\nminimum, that “the action filed against him and in which action\n\nthe attachment was decreed terminated by a final judgment in his\n\nfavor.”       Frigorífico M.H. Ortiz v. Quiles, 101 P.R.R. 928, 941\n\n(1973) (citing Martí v. Hernández, 57 P.R.R. 804 (1940)).3                      Such\n\na claim is “contingent” in the sense that its “legal basis\n\ndepends on the result of another action.”                Rodón v. Franco, 105\n\nP.R.R. 424, 425 (1976).          The attachment is not actionable unless\n\nand    until    the     defendant      obtains   a   final   and     unappealable\n\njudgment establishing that the plaintiff has no valid claim to\n\nhis property, and, therefore, that the attachment was wrongful.\n\nSee Marti, 57 P.R.R. at 806-07 (holding that cause of action\n\n“could not accrue before the judgment dismissing the complaint\n\n. . . against [the attachee] had been affirmed.                    A reversal of\n\nsaid       judgment    would   have     established    the   validity      of    the\n\n\n\n       3\n       This case does not require us to determine whether a\nfavorable judgment in the underlying action is not only\nnecessary, but also sufficient, to establish “fault” on the part\nof the attaching party.\n\n                                         -13-\n\fattachment and deprived [the attachee] of any right to claim\n\ndamages”).     Accordingly, the cause of action accrues, and the\n\nstatute of limitations begins to run, upon the entry of that\n\nfinal judgment.\n\n            Sometimes,   however,      an   individual's   property   is\n\nattached by mistake in the course of litigation to which he is\n\nnot a party.     See Fresh-O-Baking Co. v. Molinos de Puerto Rico,\n\nInc., 3 P.R. Offic. Trans. 708 (1975) (involving claim by non-\n\nparty whose equipment was stored in defendant's bakery, which\n\nplaintiff attached).     In such a case (as always), the attachment\n\nis valid only if the plaintiff's claim against the attachee is\n\nvalid.    The difference is that the plaintiff likely has not\n\nasserted any claim against the non-party whose property she\n\nattached.      Therefore, in order to establish the plaintiff's\n\n“fault or negligence,” all the non-party attachee must prove is\n\nthat the property belongs to him and not the defendant.         See id.\n\nat 715 n.4 (noting that non-party attachee could have availed\n\nhimself   of   “fast   and   simple”   independent   claim   proceeding\n\nspecifically designed to “determine ' . . . whether the personal\n\nproperty attached as belonging to a specific person, belongs to\n\nanother claiming it as his own'” (quoting Rona Electric Co. v.\n\nGarriga, 99 P.R.R. 914, 921 (1971))).          Because such proof does\n\nnot depend on a judicial determination of the merits of the\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fplaintiff's claim, the non-party attachee's cause of action\n\naccrues   upon     notice     of   the     attachment,     and    the    statute    of\n\nlimitations begins to run on that date.                  See id. at 725 (holding\n\nthat non-party attachee “did not have to wait for the results of\n\n[the underlying litigation between plaintiff and defendant] to\n\nexercise his rights”).\n\n                                          III.\n\n           Applying these general principles to the undisputed\n\nfacts here, we conclude that the complaint was timely filed.\n\nThe Villoldos attached García-Guzmán's property because they\n\nbelieved he was bound by the terms of the Settlement Agreement\n\nto satisfy his parents' debt.               The validity of that attachment\n\nhinged    on   Judge    Fusté's      ultimate      determination        of   García-\n\nGuzmán's liability under the Settlement Agreement.                      It was Judge\n\nFusté's decision on February 1, 1999 – and not the attachments\n\nthemselves     –   that     provided       the    relevant      evidence     of    the\n\nVilloldos' arguable “fault or negligence.”                  Accordingly, it was\n\nnot until that decision became final that García-Guzmán's claim\n\nfor wrongful attachment accrued and the statute of limitations\n\nbegan to run.\n\n           The     Villoldos       seek    to    bring   this    case    within    the\n\nalternate rule recognized in Fresh-O-Baking for cases in which\n\nthe   attachee     is   not   a    party    to    the    underlying     litigation.\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fGarcía-Guzmán, they argue, was not originally a party to the\n\n1991 Cases, nor was he ever joined as a party during the course\n\nof the proceedings that began in 1994.        Thus, “at the time of\n\nthe attachment, in 1995, García-Guzmán knew that his funds had\n\nbeen attached in a legal action to which he was not included as\n\na party.”\n\n            That argument elevates form over substance. Throughout\n\nthe relevant time period, García-Guzmán was consistently treated\n\nas a party, even if technically he was not one.4            For example,\n\nJudge Fusté dismissed the 1994 Action against García-Guzmán\n\n(thus   depriving   him   of   official   party   status)    because   he\n\nbelieved, apparently, that García-Guzmán already was a party to\n\nthe 1991 Cases.     Similarly, this court assumed that García-\n\nGuzmán was a party when he appealed Judge Fusté's 1996 order\n\ndenying his motion for return of the attached funds.           For their\n\npart, the Villoldos not only treated García-Guzmán as if he were\n\na party, but explicitly referred to him as a “defendant[]” in\n\nthe 1991 Cases.\n\n\n\n    4 Although we do not need to decide the issue here, we note\nthat it is unlikely that García-Guzmán became a party to the\n1991 Cases simply because he was bound by some of the terms of\nthe Settlement Agreement and those terms were incorporated into\nthe 1992 Judgment.    See Hispanic Soc'y of the New York City\nPolice Dept., Inc. v. New York City Police Dept., 806 F.2d 1147,\n1153 (2d Cir. 1986) (noting that participation in settlement\nagreement “cannot confer party status on a nonparty”).\n\n                                  -16-\n\f            In focusing on García-Guzmán's lack of official party\n\nstatus, the Villoldos miss the point of the Fresh-O-Baking rule.\n\n The fact that the attachee was not a party to the underlying\n\nlitigation matters because it usually signals that the plaintiff\n\nnever     asserted    any    claim     against     him.         Under    those\n\ncircumstances, “the wrongfulness of the attachment is known at\n\nthe outset, and need not await an elucidation of the rights and\n\nliability of the party who may have been erroneously deemed to\n\nbe the owner of the property.”         W. Clay Jackson Enters., Inc. v.\n\nGreyhound Leasing & Fin. Corp., 463 F. Supp. 666, 669 (D.P.R.\n\n1979) (explaining Fresh-O-Baking rule).\n\n            The same is not true here.           The Villoldos knew that\n\nGarcía-Guzmán owned the property they attached; they intended to\n\nattach his property in order to satisfy a debt for which they\n\nbelieved he was responsible.          Their error lay, not in a factual\n\nmistake    as   to   who    owned    what    property,    but   in   a   legal\n\nmisunderstanding of the extent of García-Guzmán's obligations\n\nunder the Settlement Agreement.             Thus, the wrongfulness of the\n\nattachments here became apparent only when Judge Fusté rejected\n\nthe Villoldos' interpretation of the Settlement Agreement and\n\ntheir claim to García-Guzmán's property.\n\n            This case, therefore, is governed by the framework\n\nestablished in Martí v. Hernández and its progeny for cases in\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fwhich the claim for wrongful attachment is contingent on the\n\noutcome of pending litigation.                See Martí, 57 P.R.R. at 806\n\n(holding that cause of action for wrongful attachment will not\n\nlie while judgment rendered in attachee's favor at trial is\n\npending on appeal).           García-Guzmán's claim against the Villoldos\n\ndepended on the outcome of the legal wrangling between the\n\nparties – whatever its precise contours – that began in 1994 and\n\nended with the judgment on February 1, 1999.                     That judgment\n\nsupplied the legal basis for García-Guzmán's claim of wrongful\n\nattachment; until it became final, “any question as to the\n\nvalidity     or     wrongfulness      of    the     attachment       remained    in\n\nabeyance.”      Id.; see also W. Clay Jackson Enters., Inc., 463 F.\n\nSupp. at 669 (holding that claim for wrongful attachment accrued\n\nupon entry of judgment, even where non-parties' property had\n\nbeen attached, where merits of claim depended on outcome of\n\nlitigation).       The Villoldos would have us hold that the statute\n\nof limitations nevertheless required García-Guzmán to file suit\n\nyears before the attachment first became actionable, simply\n\nbecause    he     was   not    officially     a   party   to   the   1991   Cases.\n\nNothing in Fresh-O-Baking compels such an anomalous result.                     See\n\nW. Clay Jackson Enters., Inc., 463 F. Supp. at 669 (stating that\n\n“neither case law nor logic” supports the argument that “non-\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fparties who are aggrieved by an attachment are compelled to file\n\nsuit while the acts complained of are not yet actionable”).\n\n                 We hold that the statue of limitations began to run\n\nwhen Judge Fusté's February 1, 1999, judgment became final.\n\nGarcía-Guzmán's complaint was timely filed.5\n\n\n\nJudgment vacated.           Remanded for further proceedings consistent\n\nwith       the   decision   herein.    Costs   are   to   be   taxed   in   the\n\nappellants' favor.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n       Our holding is limited to the question whether García-\nGuzmán complied with the statute of limitations; we intimate no\nview as to the ultimate merits of his claim for wrongful\nattachment.    García-Guzmán contends that if, as we have\ndetermined, his claim is not time-barred, he is entitled to\nsummary judgment as to the Villoldos' liability for wrongful\nattachment.   In light of its conclusion that García-Guzmán's\nclaim was barred by the statute of limitations, the district\ncourt did not address that argument. We believe the merits of\nGarcía-Guzmán's claim against the Villoldos should be considered\nin the first instance by the district court.\n\n                                      -19-\n\f",

The district court determined that Garca-Guzman's<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> claim of wrongful attachment was barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in Article 1868 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5298. The court reasoned that Garca-Guzman was not a party to the proceeding in which his property was attached, and therefore he should not have waited for the entry of a final judgment in the underlying litigation before filing his wrongful attachment action. We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, see Megwinoff v. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, 233 F.3d 73, 74 (1st Cir. 2000), and conclude that the district court's application of the statute of limitations was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arises out of a dispute between the Villoldos and Garca-Guzman's parents, the Garcas, over a business jointly owned by the two families. In 1991, the relationship between the families soured, and they filed lawsuits against each other (the \"1991 Cases\"). The 1991 Cases were consolidated and assigned to Judge Fuste. Garca-Guzman was not named as a party in either case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, the Garcas and the Villoldos agreed to settle their differences. On September 18, 1992, they executed an agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") providing that the Garcas would buy the Villoldos' stock in the business for $650,000, to be paid in a series of installments. Garca-Guzman joined his parents in signing the Settlement Agreement, although it was not then clear in what capacity he signed. The terms of the Settlement Agreement were incorporated into a judgment disposing of the 1991 Cases (the \"1992 Judgment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Garcas began to make the agreed-upon payments, they defaulted after paying slightly more than $150,000. Invoking Judge Fuste's continuing authority to enforce the 1992 Judgment, the Villoldos initiated attachment proceedings against the Garcas in March, 1994, but the action was suspended when the Garcas filed for bankruptcy. The Villoldos then turned to Garca-Guzman for satisfaction of the debt. On September 14, 1994, they obtained an order from Judge Fuste authorizing the attachment of Garca-Guzman's personal property. Instead of executing the attachment, however, the Villoldos filed a separate action against Garca-Guzman on November 19, 1994, alleging breach of contract and seeking to enforce the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement (the \"1994 Action\"). Leaving aside details not relevant here, the crux of the Villoldos' claim was that Garca-Guzman was a full signatory to the Settlement Agreement, jointly responsible for his parents' debt to the Villoldos. Garca-Guzman moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that he had not assumed any obligation to purchase the Villoldos' stock. Emphasizing that he was not a party to the 1991 Cases that gave rise to the Settlement Agreement, Garca-Guzman argued that he had signed the Agreement only in his representative capacity as manager of the business being sold (which was a party in the 1991 Cases), and that he was obligated in a personal capacity only with respect to a non-compete covenant set forth in the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court never addressed the merits of those arguments, ruling instead that the Villoldos' claim against Garca-Guzman should have been addressed to Judge Fuste in the form of a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement. The court reasoned that, since the terms of the Settlement Agreement were incorporated into the 1992 Judgment, a breach of the Agreement would be a violation of the Judgment itself. Therefore, the court concluded, Judge Fuste retained jurisdiction over the 1991 Cases to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Rather than dismiss the Villoldos' complaint against Garca-Guzman, however, the court simply consolidated the 1994 Action with the 1991 Cases and transferred it to Judge Fuste.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 19, 1995, Judge Fuste dismissed the 1994 Action. In an order entered the same day, he explained his ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1994 suit is not a separate claim. It only involves a claim for execution of judgment which results from the earlier judgment in the two consolidated cases [the 1991 Cases]. . . . The 1994 civil action is duplicitous and there is no reason, legal or otherwise, for it to be litigated separately as an independent civil action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Fuste apparently believed that Garca-Guzman already was a party to the 1991 Cases - at least for enforcement purposes - by virtue of his participation in the Settlement Agreement and the incorporation of that Agreement into the 1992 Judgment. Thus, there was no need for a separate action against him. Any obligation Garca-Guzman owed to the Villoldos under the Settlement Agreement could be enforced by post-judgment motions for execution of the 1992 Judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Villoldos recognized, Judge Fuste determined implicitly in his order that Garca-Guzman was, in fact, responsible for his parents' debt. Accordingly, the Villoldos proceeded to execute the writ of attachment issued the previous September against Garca-Guzman's personal property. On June 21, 1995, they attached $6,862 held in his bank account. They also obtained (but did not execute) a second writ of attachment against Garca-Guzman, this time authorizing the attachment of his real property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garca-Guzman immediately filed an emergency motion seeking return of the attached bank funds. Judge Fuste initially responded on July 5, 1995, with the following margin order:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court has examined - once again - the settlement agreement and it can be interpreted as we did earlier to the effect that Garca-Guzman joined his parents in guaranteeing the payment of the stipulated accounts. The motion for execution was duly notified and this appears to be a late opposition to it. The Villoldos will express their views in not more than 10 pages . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, in an order entered on January 31, 1996, Judge Fuste denied Garca-Guzman's request for return of the attached bank funds on the ground that Garca-Guzman was obligated by the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the 1992 Judgment to satisfy the debt owed to the Villoldos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garca-Guzman appealed, and we held in an unpublished opinion that the Settlement Agreement was ambiguous as to the extent of his responsibility for the debt to the Villoldos. Garca-Guzman v. Villoldo, No. 96-1215 (1st Cir. Feb. 14, 1997) (unpublished). Accordingly, we vacated the January 31 order and remanded for a factual inquiry into the parties' intent. Judge Fuste held an evidentiary hearing and, based on the evidence presented there, determined that Garca-Guzman \"was asked to sign, not as a full guarantor, but only in reference to the covenant not to compete.\" Therefore, he concluded, \"the orders that were originally entered against Mr. Garca Guzman for execution of judgment should be, for all purposes, vacated.\" On February 1, 1999, Judge Fuste entered judgment \"dismissing the complaint\" against Garca-Guzman. The Villoldos did not appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 15, 1999, Garca-Guzman filed the instant diversity action for wrongful attachment and malicious prosecution, seeking damages allegedly caused by the attachment of his bank account and the order of attachment obtained - but never executed - against his real property. The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(c). Several months later, they filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the claim of wrongful attachment. The Villoldos argued, as relevant here, that the claim was time-barred because Garca-Guzman's complaint was filed more than one year after the date on which he became aware of the relevant attachments. The magistrate judge agreed, reasoning that Garca-Guzman was not a party to the 1991 Cases, and therefore the \"applicable statute of limitations is one year from the day [on] which [Garca-Guzman] knew of the attachment (i.e., June of 1995).\" The judge rejected Garca-Guzman's argument that he had been \"brought into\" the 1991 Cases in 1994, when the Villoldos obtained authorization to attach his property to enforce the 1992 Judgment. \"[T]hroughout all the proceedings,\" he pointed out, \"Garca-Guzman has argued that he was not a party to the original litigation, and in fact, on the basis of that argument he was able to avoid liability under the settlement agreement.\" Thus, the judge concluded, the fact that Judge Fuste's February 1, 1999, judgment purported to \"dismiss\" a \"complaint\" against Garca-Guzman was immaterial. The only complaint ever filed against Garca-Guzman was in connection with the 1994 Action, and was dismissed in April 1995 - before the Villoldos attached Garca-Guzman's personal property, and long before Judge Fuste's decision in 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge granted the Villoldos' motion for summary judgment on Garca-Guzman's claim of wrongful attachment. Garca-Guzman then obtained a voluntary dismissal of his remaining claim of malicious prosecution, and the magistrate judge entered judgment dismissing the complaint in its entirety. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claims of wrongful attachment are subject to a one-year statute of limitations applicable to all actions for \"obligations arising from . . . fault or negligence.\" 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5298. The timing of the statute of limitations depends on when the substantive elements of the claim are present. Thus, before we can address the statute of limitations question in this case, we need to understand what, in general, makes an attachment \"wrongful\" under Puerto Rico law, and how such wrongfulness ordinarily is established. We then can apply those general principles to the facts here to determine when the statute of limitations began to run on Garca-Guzman's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 56 of the Puerto Rico Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the plaintiff in any action may move, before or after judgment is entered, for a provisional attachment of the defendant's property to \"secure satisfaction of the judgment.\" 32 L.P.R.A. App. III R. 56.1. The validity of such an attachment depends on the validity of the plaintiff's claim against the defendant-attachee. If the court determines that the plaintiff's claim against the defendant has no merit, it follows that she has no right to the defendant's property, and that the attachment was unwarranted. The plaintiff then may be liable to the defendant for the damages caused by the attachment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liability for a wrongful attachment is based on Article 1802 of the Civil Code, which provides that \"[a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5141. A wrongful attachment claim, therefore, has three elements: an act or omission, damages, and \"fault or negligence.\" The first two elements are fairly straightforward. The relevant \"act\" is the attachment of the defendant's property, and, as Rule 56 recognizes, even a temporary attachment can cause damage. The defendant's credit may be adversely affected; his business may fail; he may suffer emotional distress. See, e.g., Feliciano v. Mercantil Cedeno, S. en C., 85 P.R.R. 138 (1962) (recognizing that damages are available to owner of business wrongfully attached for damages caused to good name of business and for mental anguish and moral damages suffered by owner).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third element - that the damage was caused by the attaching party's \"fault or negligence\" - is more complicated. In the usual case, the question whether the attachment was \"wrongful\" is answered by reference to the outcome of the dispute between the parties. If the plaintiff-attachor prevailed, it follows that the attachment was warranted and the defendant-attachee has no cause for complaint. On the other hand, a judgment in favor of the defendant-attachee establishes that the plaintiff had no valid claim against the defendant or his property, and, consequently, that the attachment was in error. As the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here is no doubt that a person is guilty of fault who, to secure the result of an action which he is prosecuting against a specific person, requests and obtains of the court the attachment of the property of his adversary, which attachment afterward, either through improper preparation of the complaint or owing to the said complaint being groundless or frivolous, must be dissolved, after having caused considerable damage and prejudice to the credit or interests of the owner of the property attached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cintron v. Insular Indus. &amp; Agric. Exposition Ass'n, Inc., 58 P.R.R. 820, 825 (1941) (quoting Lowande v.

Franco, 105 P.R.R. 424, 425 (1976). The attachment is not actionable unless and until the defendant obtains a final and unappealable judgment establishing that the plaintiff has no valid claim to his property, and, therefore, that the attachment was wrongful. See Marti, 57 P.R.R. at 806-07 (holding that cause of action \"could not accrue before the judgment dismissing the complaint . . . against [the attachee] had been affirmed. A reversal of said judgment would have established the validity of the attachment and deprived [the attachee] of any right to claim damages\"). Accordingly, the cause of action accrues, and the statute of limitations begins to run, upon the entry of that final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometimes, however, an individual's property is attached by mistake in the course of litigation to which he is not a party. See Fresh-O-Baking Co. v. Molinos de Puerto Rico, Inc., 3 P.R. Offic. Trans. 708 (1975) (involving claim by non-party whose equipment was stored in defendant's bakery, which plaintiff attached). In such a case (as always), the attachment is valid only if the plaintiff's claim against the attachee is valid. The difference is that the plaintiff likely has not asserted any claim against the non-party whose property she attached. Therefore, in order to establish the plaintiff's \"fault or negligence,\" all the non-party attachee must prove is that the property belongs to him and not the defendant. See id. at 715 n.4 (noting that non-party attachee could have availed himself of \"fast and simple\" independent claim proceeding specifically designed to \"determine ' . . . whether the personal property attached as belonging to a specific person, belongs to another claiming it as his own'\" (quoting Rona Electric Co. v. Garriga, 99 P.R.R. 914, 921 (1971))). Because such proof does not depend on a judicial determination of the merits of the plaintiff's claim, the non-party attachee's cause of action accrues upon notice of the attachment, and the statute of limitations begins to run on that date. See id. at 725 (holding that non-party attachee \"did not have to wait for the results of [the underlying litigation between plaintiff and defendant] to exercise his rights\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these general principles to the undisputed facts here, we conclude that the complaint was timely filed. The Villoldos attached Garca-Guzman's property because they believed he was bound by the terms of the Settlement Agreement to satisfy his parents' debt. The validity of that attachment hinged on Judge Fuste's ultimate determination of Garca-Guzman's liability under the Settlement Agreement. It was Judge Fuste's decision on February 1, 1999 - and not the attachments themselves - that provided the relevant evidence of the Villoldos' arguable \"fault or negligence.\" Accordingly, it was not until that decision became final that Garca-Guzman's claim for wrongful attachment accrued and the statute of limitations began to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Villoldos seek to bring this case within the alternate rule recognized in Fresh-O-Baking for cases in which the attachee is not a party to the underlying litigation. Garca-Guzman, they argue, was not originally a party to the 1991 Cases, nor was he ever joined as a party during the course of the proceedings that began in 1994. Thus, \"at the time of the attachment, in 1995, Garca-Guzman knew that his funds had been attached in a legal action to which he was not included as a party.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That argument elevates form over substance. Throughout the relevant time period, Garca-Guzman was consistently treated as a party, even if technically he was not one.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For example, Judge Fuste dismissed the 1994 Action against Garca-Guzman (thus depriving him of official party status) because he believed, apparently, that Garca-Guzman already was a party to the 1991 Cases. Similarly, this court assumed that Garca-Guzman was a party when he appealed Judge Fuste's 1996 order denying his motion for return of the attached funds. For their part, the Villoldos not only treated Garca-Guzman as if he were a party, but explicitly referred to him as a \"defendant[]\" in the 1991 Cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In focusing on Garca-Guzman's lack of official party status, the Villoldos miss the point of the Fresh-O-Baking rule. The fact that the attachee was not a party to the underlying litigation matters because it usually signals that the plaintiff never asserted any claim against him. Under those circumstances, \"the wrongfulness of the attachment is known at the outset, and need not await an elucidation of the rights and liability of the party who may have been erroneously deemed to be the owner of the property.\" W. Clay Jackson Enters., Inc. v. Greyhound Leasing &amp; Fin. Corp., 463 F. Supp. 666, 669 (D.P.R. 1979) (explaining Fresh-O-Baking rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is not true here. The Villoldos knew that Garca-Guzman owned the property they attached; they intended to attach his property in order to satisfy a debt for which they believed he was responsible. Their error lay, not in a factual mistake as to who owned what property, but in a legal misunderstanding of the extent of Garca-Guzman's obligations under the Settlement Agreement. Thus, the wrongfulness of the attachments here became apparent only when Judge Fuste rejected the Villoldos' interpretation of the Settlement Agreement and their claim to Garca-Guzman's property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case, therefore, is governed by the framework established in Mart v. Hernandez and its progeny for cases in which the claim for wrongful attachment is contingent on the outcome of pending litigation. See Mart, 57 P.R.R. at 806 (holding that cause of action for wrongful attachment will not lie while judgment rendered in attachee's favor at trial is pending on appeal). Garca-Guzman's claim against the Villoldos depended on the outcome of the legal wrangling between the parties - whatever its precise contours - that began in 1994 and ended with the judgment on February 1, 1999. That judgment supplied the legal basis for Garca-Guzman's claim of wrongful attachment; until it became final, \"any question as to the validity or wrongfulness of the attachment remained in abeyance.\" Id.; see also W. Clay Jackson Enters., Inc., 463 F. Supp. at 669 (holding that claim for wrongful attachment accrued upon entry of judgment, even where non-parties' property had been attached, where merits of claim depended on outcome of litigation). The Villoldos would have us hold that the statute of limitations nevertheless required Garca-Guzman to file suit years before the attachment first became actionable, simply because he was not officially a party to the 1991 Cases. Nothing in Fresh-O-Baking compels such an anomalous result. See W. Clay Jackson Enters., Inc., 463 F. Supp. at 669 (stating that \"neither case law nor logic\" supports the argument that \"non-parties who are aggrieved by an attachment are compelled to file suit while the acts complained of are not yet actionable\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the statue of limitations began to run when Judge Fuste's February 1, 1999, judgment became final.

App. III R. 56.3. However, the bond requirement is waived in cases where it seems especially likely that the plaintiff does, in fact, have a valid claim against the defendant and his property. Thus, Rule 56.3 provides that the plaintiff may obtain an attachment without bond if, inter alia, the plaintiff alleges under oath that the defendant owes her a legally enforceable obligation, or - as is the case here - the attachment \"is sought after judgment is entered.\" In those circumstances, the absence of a protective bond means that the plaintiff is directly liable for any damages sustained by the defendant in the event that the attachment is deemed wrongful.

In light of its conclusion that Garca-Guzman's claim was barred by the statute of limitations, the district court did not address that argument. We believe the merits of Garca-Guzman's claim against the Villoldos should be considered in the first instance by the district court.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court determined that Garca-Guzman's<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> claim of wrongful attachment was barred by the one-year statute of limitations set forth in Article 1868 of the Civil Code of Puerto Rico, 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5298. The court reasoned that Garca-Guzman was not a party to the proceeding in which his property was attached, and therefore he should not have waited for the entry of a final judgment in the underlying litigation before filing his wrongful attachment action. We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, see Megwinoff v. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199163\"><a href=\"/opinion/199163/andreu-megwinoff-v-banco-bilbao/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir. 2000), and conclude that the district court's application of the statute of limitations was erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arises out of a dispute between the Villoldos and Garca-Guzman's parents, the Garcas, over a business jointly owned by the two families. In 1991, the relationship between the families soured, and they filed lawsuits against each other (the \"1991 Cases\"). The 1991 Cases were consolidated and assigned to Judge Fuste. Garca-Guzman was not named as a party in either case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, the Garcas and the Villoldos agreed to settle their differences. On September 18, 1992, they executed an agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") providing that the Garcas would buy the Villoldos' stock in the business for $650,000, to be paid in a series of installments. Garca-Guzman joined his parents in signing the Settlement Agreement, although it was not then clear in what capacity he signed. The terms of the Settlement Agreement were incorporated into a judgment disposing of the 1991 Cases (the \"1992 Judgment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Garcas began to make the agreed-upon payments, they defaulted after paying slightly more than $150,000. Invoking Judge Fuste's continuing authority to enforce the 1992 Judgment, the Villoldos initiated attachment proceedings against the Garcas in March, 1994, but the action was suspended when the Garcas filed for bankruptcy. The Villoldos then turned to Garca-Guzman for satisfaction of the debt. On September 14, 1994, they obtained an order from Judge Fuste authorizing the attachment of Garca-Guzman's personal property. Instead of executing the attachment, however, the Villoldos filed a separate action against Garca-Guzman on November 19, 1994, alleging breach of contract and seeking to enforce the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement (the \"1994 Action\"). Leaving aside details not relevant here, the crux of the Villoldos' claim was that Garca-Guzman was a full signatory to the Settlement Agreement, jointly responsible for his parents' debt to the Villoldos. Garca-Guzman moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that he had not assumed any obligation to purchase the Villoldos' stock. Emphasizing that he was not a party to the 1991 Cases that gave rise to the Settlement Agreement, Garca-Guzman argued that he had signed the Agreement only in his representative capacity as manager of the business being sold (which was a party in the 1991 Cases), and that he was obligated in a personal capacity only with respect to a non-compete covenant set forth in the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court never addressed the merits of those arguments, ruling instead that the Villoldos' claim against Garca-Guzman should have been addressed to Judge Fuste in the form of a motion to enforce the Settlement Agreement. The court reasoned that, since the terms of the Settlement Agreement were incorporated into the 1992 Judgment, a breach of the Agreement would be a violation of the Judgment itself. Therefore, the court concluded, Judge Fuste retained jurisdiction over the 1991 Cases to enforce the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Rather than dismiss the Villoldos' complaint against Garca-Guzman, however, the court simply consolidated the 1994 Action with the 1991 Cases and transferred it to Judge Fuste.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 19, 1995, Judge Fuste dismissed the 1994 Action. In an order entered the same day, he explained his ruling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1994 suit is not a separate claim. It only involves a claim for execution of judgment which results from the earlier judgment in the two consolidated cases [the 1991 Cases]. . . . The 1994 civil action is duplicitous and there is no reason, legal or otherwise, for it to be litigated separately as an independent civil action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judge Fuste apparently believed that Garca-Guzman already was a party to the 1991 Cases - at least for enforcement purposes - by virtue of his participation in the Settlement Agreement and the incorporation of that Agreement into the 1992 Judgment. Thus, there was no need for a separate action against him. Any obligation Garca-Guzman owed to the Villoldos under the Settlement Agreement could be enforced by post-judgment motions for execution of the 1992 Judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Villoldos recognized, Judge Fuste determined implicitly in his order that Garca-Guzman was, in fact, responsible for his parents' debt. Accordingly, the Villoldos proceeded to execute the writ of attachment issued the previous September against Garca-Guzman's personal property. On June 21, 1995, they attached $6,862 held in his bank account. They also obtained (but did not execute) a second writ of attachment against Garca-Guzman, this time authorizing the attachment of his real property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garca-Guzman immediately filed an emergency motion seeking return of the attached bank funds. Judge Fuste initially responded on July 5, 1995, with the following margin order:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court has examined - once again - the settlement agreement and it can be interpreted as we did earlier to the effect that Garca-Guzman joined his parents in guaranteeing the payment of the stipulated accounts. The motion for execution was duly notified and this appears to be a late opposition to it. The Villoldos will express their views in not more than 10 pages . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then, in an order entered on January 31, 1996, Judge Fuste denied Garca-Guzman's request for return of the attached bank funds on the ground that Garca-Guzman was obligated by the terms of the Settlement Agreement and the 1992 Judgment to satisfy the debt owed to the Villoldos.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garca-Guzman appealed, and we held in an unpublished opinion that the Settlement Agreement was ambiguous as to the extent of his responsibility for the debt to the Villoldos. Garca-Guzman v. Villoldo, No. 96-1215 (1st Cir. Feb. 14, 1997) (unpublished). Accordingly, we vacated the January 31 order and remanded for a factual inquiry into the parties' intent. Judge Fuste held an evidentiary hearing and, based on the evidence presented there, determined that Garca-Guzman \"was asked to sign, not as a full guarantor, but only in reference to the covenant not to compete.\" Therefore, he concluded, \"the orders that were originally entered against Mr. Garca Guzman for execution of judgment should be, for all purposes, vacated.\" On February 1, 1999, Judge Fuste entered judgment \"dismissing the complaint\" against Garca-Guzman. The Villoldos did not appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 15, 1999, Garca-Guzman filed the instant diversity action for wrongful attachment and malicious prosecution, seeking damages allegedly caused by the attachment of his bank account and the order of attachment obtained - but never executed - against his real property. The parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge. See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(c). Several months later, they filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the claim of wrongful attachment. The Villoldos argued, as relevant here, that the claim was time-barred because Garca-Guzman's complaint was filed more than one year after the date on which he became aware of the relevant attachments. The magistrate judge agreed, reasoning that Garca-Guzman was not a party to the 1991 Cases, and therefore the \"applicable statute of limitations is one year from the day [on] which [Garca-Guzman] knew of the attachment (i.e., June of 1995).\" The judge rejected Garca-Guzman's argument that he had been \"brought into\" the 1991 Cases in 1994, when the Villoldos obtained authorization to attach his property to enforce the 1992 Judgment. \"[T]hroughout all the proceedings,\" he pointed out, \"Garca-Guzman has argued that he was not a party to the original litigation, and in fact, on the basis of that argument he was able to avoid liability under the settlement agreement.\" Thus, the judge concluded, the fact that Judge Fuste's February 1, 1999, judgment purported to \"dismiss\" a \"complaint\" against Garca-Guzman was immaterial. The only complaint ever filed against Garca-Guzman was in connection with the 1994 Action, and was dismissed in April 1995 - before the Villoldos attached Garca-Guzman's personal property, and long before Judge Fuste's decision in 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge granted the Villoldos' motion for summary judgment on Garca-Guzman's claim of wrongful attachment. Garca-Guzman then obtained a voluntary dismissal of his remaining claim of malicious prosecution, and the magistrate judge entered judgment dismissing the complaint in its entirety. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claims of wrongful attachment are subject to a one-year statute of limitations applicable to all actions for \"obligations arising from . . . fault or negligence.\" 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5298. The timing of the statute of limitations depends on when the substantive elements of the claim are present. Thus, before we can address the statute of limitations question in this case, we need to understand what, in general, makes an attachment \"wrongful\" under Puerto Rico law, and how such wrongfulness ordinarily is established. We then can apply those general principles to the facts here to determine when the statute of limitations began to run on Garca-Guzman's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 56 of the Puerto Rico Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the plaintiff in any action may move, before or after judgment is entered, for a provisional attachment of the defendant's property to \"secure satisfaction of the judgment.\" 32 L.P.R.A. App. III R. 56.1. The validity of such an attachment depends on the validity of the plaintiff's claim against the defendant-attachee. If the court determines that the plaintiff's claim against the defendant has no merit, it follows that she has no right to the defendant's property, and that the attachment was unwarranted. The plaintiff then may be liable to the defendant for the damages caused by the attachment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Liability for a wrongful attachment is based on Article 1802 of the Civil Code, which provides that \"[a] person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" 31 L.P.R.A. &#167; 5141. A wrongful attachment claim, therefore, has three elements: an act or omission, damages, and \"fault or negligence.\" The first two elements are fairly straightforward. The relevant \"act\" is the attachment of the defendant's property, and, as Rule 56 recognizes, even a temporary attachment can cause damage. The defendant's credit may be adversely affected; his business may fail; he may suffer emotional distress. See, e.g., Feliciano v. Mercantil Cedeno, S. en C., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span> (1962) (recognizing that damages are available to owner of business wrongfully attached for damages caused to good name of business and for mental anguish and moral damages suffered by owner).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third element - that the damage was caused by the attaching party's \"fault or negligence\" - is more complicated. In the usual case, the question whether the attachment was \"wrongful\" is answered by reference to the outcome of the dispute between the parties. If the plaintiff-attachor prevailed, it follows that the attachment was warranted and the defendant-attachee has no cause for complaint. On the other hand, a judgment in favor of the defendant-attachee establishes that the plaintiff had no valid claim against the defendant or his property, and, consequently, that the attachment was in error. As the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]here is no doubt that a person is guilty of fault who, to secure the result of an action which he is prosecuting against a specific person, requests and obtains of the court the attachment of the property of his adversary, which attachment afterward, either through improper preparation of the complaint or owing to the said complaint being groundless or frivolous, must be dissolved, after having caused considerable damage and prejudice to the credit or interests of the owner of the property attached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cintron v.

Franco, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></span>, 425 (1976). The attachment is not actionable unless and until the defendant obtains a final and unappealable judgment establishing that the plaintiff has no valid claim to his property, and, therefore, that the attachment was wrongful. See Marti, 57 P.R.R. at 806-07 (holding that cause of action \"could not accrue before the judgment dismissing the complaint . . . against [the attachee] had been affirmed. A reversal of said judgment would have established the validity of the attachment and deprived [the attachee] of any right to claim damages\"). Accordingly, the cause of action accrues, and the statute of limitations begins to run, upon the entry of that final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sometimes, however, an individual's property is attached by mistake in the course of litigation to which he is not a party. See Fresh-O-Baking Co. v. Molinos de Puerto Rico, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></span> (1975) (involving claim by non-party whose equipment was stored in defendant's bakery, which plaintiff attached). In such a case (as always), the attachment is valid only if the plaintiff's claim against the attachee is valid. The difference is that the plaintiff likely has not asserted any claim against the non-party whose property she attached. Therefore, in order to establish the plaintiff's \"fault or negligence,\" all the non-party attachee must prove is that the property belongs to him and not the defendant. See id. at 715 n.4 (noting that non-party attachee could have availed himself of \"fast and simple\" independent claim proceeding specifically designed to \"determine ' . . . whether the personal property attached as belonging to a specific person, belongs to another claiming it as his own'\" (quoting Rona Electric Co. v. Garriga, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></span>, 921 (1971))). Because such proof does not depend on a judicial determination of the merits of the plaintiff's claim, the non-party attachee's cause of action accrues upon notice of the attachment, and the statute of limitations begins to run on that date. See id. at 725 (holding that non-party attachee \"did not have to wait for the results of [the underlying litigation between plaintiff and defendant] to exercise his rights\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these general principles to the undisputed facts here, we conclude that the complaint was timely filed. The Villoldos attached Garca-Guzman's property because they believed he was bound by the terms of the Settlement Agreement to satisfy his parents' debt. The validity of that attachment hinged on Judge Fuste's ultimate determination of Garca-Guzman's liability under the Settlement Agreement. It was Judge Fuste's decision on February 1, 1999 - and not the attachments themselves - that provided the relevant evidence of the Villoldos' arguable \"fault or negligence.\" Accordingly, it was not until that decision became final that Garca-Guzman's claim for wrongful attachment accrued and the statute of limitations began to run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Villoldos seek to bring this case within the alternate rule recognized in Fresh-O-Baking for cases in which the attachee is not a party to the underlying litigation. Garca-Guzman, they argue, was not originally a party to the 1991 Cases, nor was he ever joined as a party during the course of the proceedings that began in 1994. Thus, \"at the time of the attachment, in 1995, Garca-Guzman knew that his funds had been attached in a legal action to which he was not included as a party.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That argument elevates form over substance. Throughout the relevant time period, Garca-Guzman was consistently treated as a party, even if technically he was not one.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For example, Judge Fuste dismissed the 1994 Action against Garca-Guzman (thus depriving him of official party status) because he believed, apparently, that Garca-Guzman already was a party to the 1991 Cases. Similarly, this court assumed that Garca-Guzman was a party when he appealed Judge Fuste's 1996 order denying his motion for return of the attached funds. For their part, the Villoldos not only treated Garca-Guzman as if he were a party, but explicitly referred to him as a \"defendant[]\" in the 1991 Cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In focusing on Garca-Guzman's lack of official party status, the Villoldos miss the point of the Fresh-O-Baking rule. The fact that the attachee was not a party to the underlying litigation matters because it usually signals that the plaintiff never asserted any claim against him. Under those circumstances, \"the wrongfulness of the attachment is known at the outset, and need not await an elucidation of the rights and liability of the party who may have been erroneously deemed to be the owner of the property.\" W. Clay Jackson Enters., Inc. v. Greyhound Leasing &amp; Fin. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2141074\"><a href=\"/opinion/2141074/w-clay-jackson-enterprises-v-greyhound-leasing-financial-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span>, 669 (D.P.R. 1979) (explaining Fresh-O-Baking rule).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same is not true here. The Villoldos knew that Garca-Guzman owned the property they attached; they intended to attach his property in order to satisfy a debt for which they believed he was responsible. Their error lay, not in a factual mistake as to who owned what property, but in a legal misunderstanding of the extent of Garca-Guzman's obligations under the Settlement Agreement. Thus, the wrongfulness of the attachments here became apparent only when Judge Fuste rejected the Villoldos' interpretation of the Settlement Agreement and their claim to Garca-Guzman's property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case, therefore, is governed by the framework established in Mart v. Hernandez and its progeny for cases in which the claim for wrongful attachment is contingent on the outcome of pending litigation. See Mart, 57 P.R.R. at 806 (holding that cause of action for wrongful attachment will not lie while judgment rendered in attachee's favor at trial is pending on appeal). Garca-Guzman's claim against the Villoldos depended on the outcome of the legal wrangling between the parties - whatever its precise contours - that began in 1994 and ended with the judgment on February 1, 1999. That judgment supplied the legal basis for Garca-Guzman's claim of wrongful attachment; until it became final, \"any question as to the validity or wrongfulness of the attachment remained in abeyance.\" Id.; see also W. Clay Jackson Enters., Inc., 463 F. Supp. at 669 (holding that claim for wrongful attachment accrued upon entry of judgment, even where non-parties' property had been attached, where merits of claim depended on outcome of litigation). The Villoldos would have us hold that the statute of limitations nevertheless required Garca-Guzman to file suit years before the attachment first became actionable, simply because he was not officially a party to the 1991 Cases. Nothing in Fresh-O-Baking compels such an anomalous result. See W. Clay Jackson Enters., Inc., 463 F. Supp. at 669 (stating that \"neither case law nor logic\" supports the argument that \"non-parties who are aggrieved by an attachment are compelled to file suit while the acts complained of are not yet actionable\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the statue of limitations began to run when Judge Fuste's February 1, 1999, judgment became final.

App. III R. 56.3. However, the bond requirement is waived in cases where it seems especially likely that the plaintiff does, in fact, have a valid claim against the defendant and his property. Thus, Rule 56.3 provides that the plaintiff may obtain an attachment without bond if, inter alia, the plaintiff alleges under oath that the defendant owes her a legally enforceable obligation, or - as is the case here - the attachment \"is sought after judgment is entered.\" In those circumstances, the absence of a protective bond means that the plaintiff is directly liable for any damages sustained by the defendant in the event that the attachment is deemed wrongful.

In light of its conclusion that Garca-Guzman's claim was barred by the statute of limitations, the district court did not address that argument. We believe the merits of Garca-Guzman's claim against the Villoldos should be considered in the first instance by the district court.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
