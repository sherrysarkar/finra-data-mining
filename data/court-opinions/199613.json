This is an insurance coverage dispute,\n\ngoverned by Puerto Rican law, under a Comprehensive General Liability\n\npolicy. Antilles Insurance Company denied coverage to a claim asserted\n\nby its insureds, C.B. Import Transamerica Corporation and Horacio\n\nCampolieto. The insureds owned other property, on which they began\n\nconstruction of a new building, apart from their principal place of\n\nbusiness.    An automobile accident occurred in connection with\n\nconstruction-related excavation at this other property and the insureds\n\nwere held liable to the injured party. Under their CGL policy, the\n\ninsureds sought to recover from Antilles a sum equal to their\n\nobligations to the accident victim. Antilles denied the claim for a\n\nvariety of reasons, most of which amounted to the proposition that the\n\nCGL policy's coverage did not extend to the property on which the\n\nautomobile accident occurred.\n\n            The district court denied Antilles's motion for summary\n\njudgment, finding there was a material dispute of fact as to the extent\n\nof coverage. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court decided\n\nthe coverage issue against the insureds, who appeal.\n\n            The insureds concede they represented in their \"Common Policy\n\nDeclarations,\" as they stood on the date of the accident, that their\n\nonly business was \"Automobile Accessories Parts Distributor\" and that\n\n\"all premises\" owned, rented, or occupied by them were at the Edificio\n\nManuel del Valle and Centro Industrial Corujo. No notice was given to\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fthe insurer until after the accident, by Endorsement No. 13, that the\n\npremises on which the accident occurred had been acquired by the\n\ninsureds after the initial date of the CGL policy. The premises on\n\nwhich there was construction were intended to be used for a business\n\nother than the automobile parts business. When the premises were added\n\npost-accident by Endorsement No. 13, the insureds paid an additional\n\npremium.\n\n           The insureds' theory is that premises not described by the\n\ninsureds in their declarations nonetheless are within the coverage of\n\nthe CGL policy because a CGL policy \"provides coverage automatically\n\nfor any new premises or hazards which develop during the policy\n\nperiod.\" A citation given by the insureds to support this assertion is\n\nP. Gordis and E. Chlanda, Property and Casualty Insurance 445 (27th ed.\n\n1982). Gordis and Chlanda say \"[t]he insured is not required to give\n\nany notice of such new hazards\" and state that a CGL policy will \"cover\n\nautomatically any other property . . . .\" While it is arguable this\n\ncommentary supports the insureds' proposition, an authoritative\n\nprecedent under Puerto Rican law defeats coverage. Stokes v. Serrano-\n\nLecaroz, 98 TSPR 49 (1998), held that a country club's CGL policy did\n\nnot cover risks arising out of its marina operation because the marina\n\nwas a different business, not mentioned anywhere in the insured's CGL\n\npolicy, and the declarations page described the country club business.\n\n           The district court made factual findings, after hearing\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\ftestimony from the parties, that the reasonable understanding of the\n\nCGL coverage was that it did not extend to an undescribed premises not\n\nassociated with the business described on the declarations page. The\n\ndistrict court also made factual determinations, including a\n\ndetermination that the insureds' argument that an audit by the insurer\n\nwould have picked up the additional premises was simply incorrect. The\n\ndistrict court also reasoned that there would have been an adjustment\n\nin premiums if additional premises or a new business were added. We\n\ncannot say those factual findings were clearly erroneous. We have\n\nconsidered the insureds' additional arguments; they are without merit.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.    Costs to appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
