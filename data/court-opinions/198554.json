Fried, General\r\nCounsel, Charlotte Hardnett, Principal Deputy General Counsel, John\r\nM. Sacchetti, Associate General Counsel, and Karen J. Aviles,\r\nLitigation Branch, Office of the General Counsel, Social Security\r\nAdministration, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJULY 12, 1999\r\n\n           Per Curiam.  Claimant-appellant was awarded social\r\nsecurity survivor's benefits beginning in 1993.  He now seeks\r\nto reopen an unsuccessful 1982 application in order to obtain\r\nsurvivor's benefits for the years 1982-93.  \r\n           The district court held that it lacked subject matter\r\njurisdiction to review the Secretary's decision not to reopen\r\nthe denial of the 1982 application in the absence of a\r\ncolorable constitutional claim.  See Califano v. Sanders, 430\r\nU.S. 99 (1977).  Several constitutional claims were alleged by\r\nappellant below, but they were \"not colorable.\"\r\n           Here, appellant attempts to supply the jurisdictional\r\nelement by alleging a new constitutional claim which was not\r\nsquarely presented below.  He argues that the SSA's initial\r\nnotice denying his 1982 application violated due process\r\nbecause it did not warn that a failure to request\r\nreconsideration \"would result in a loss of benefits which would\r\nremain forever final.\"  The Secretary responds, inter alia,\r\nthat appellant waived this argument by failing to urge it in\r\nthe district court.\r\n           We have reviewed with care the record citations which\r\nappellant has offered in reply to the  Secretary's objection. \r\nOur own reading is that except for a single, awkwardly-placed\r\nsentence in one of his two lengthy legal memoranda, appellant\r\ndid not urge in the district court the claim which he seeks to\r\nraise here.\r\n           Arguments not fully developed in the lower court are\r\ndeemed waived on appeal.  Armistead v. C &amp; M Transp., Inc., 49\r\nF.3d 43, 44 n.2 (1st Cir. 1995).  It is not enough to merely\r\nmention a possible argument; a litigant has an obligation to\r\nspell out the argument squarely and distinctly.  United States\r\nv. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 14 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 494 U.S.\r\n1082 (1990).  \r\n           Since the sole issue raised on appeal was not fairly\r\npresented in the district court, the judgment is affirmed. \r\nWhile we need not reach it, we note that any review of the\r\nmerits of appellant's new constitutional claim would be stymied\r\nin any event by the apparent lack of a clear causal connection\r\nbetween the notice's alleged deficiency and appellant's loss of\r\nbenefits.\r\n           Affirmed.\n",
