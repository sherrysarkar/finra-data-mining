We are asked in  this appeal\r                                           \r\n\nto  sort  out  the  constitutional  principles  at  play  when  a\r\n\nmunicipality, in pursuit of improved  aesthetics, regulates signs\r\n\nand billboards.   In many respects,  this is a  case of deja  vu.\r\n\nSeven  years ago,  the same  plaintiff successfully  challenged a\r\n\nsimilar  sign ordinance as violative of the First Amendment.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nAckerley Communications of Massachusetts  v. City of  Somerville,\r                                                                          \r\n\n878   F.2d  513  (1st   Cir.  1989).     Although  the  defending\r\n\nmunicipality has  changed -- Cambridge now  replaces its neighbor\r\n\nSomerville -- the central issue remains the same: the validity of\r\n\ndistinctions  drawn  between  \"onsite\"  and  \"offsite\" signs  and\r\n\nbetween   commercial   and   noncommercial   messages.1      With\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1 We repeat our explanation of the onsite/offsite\r\ndistinction from City of Somerville, 878 F.2d at 513 n.1:\r                                             \r\n\n          An onsite sign carries a message that bears some\r\n     relationship to the activities conducted on the\r\n     premises where the sign is located.  For example, an\r\n     onsite sign may simply identify a business or agency\r\n     (\"Joe's Hardware\" or \"YMCA\"), or it may advertise a\r\n     product or service available at that location\r\n     (\"Budweiser Beer\" at Parise's Cafe or child care at the\r\n     Lutheran Church).  Depending upon the business or\r\n     agency, the message on the sign may be deemed either\r\n     commercial or noncommercial.  An offsite sign -- the\r\n     category into which most billboards fit -- carries a\r\n     message unrelated to its particular location.  These\r\n     signs also may display either commercial or\r\n     noncommercial messages.  For example, an offsite sign\r\n     may advertise \"Great Gifts at Kappy's Liquors,\" with\r\n     Kappy's Liquors being located at some distance from the\r\n     sign, or it may say \"No one should be left out in the\r\n     cold.  Write: Citizens Energy Corp.\" \r\n\n          Thus, the onsite/offsite distinction is not a\r\n     distinction between signs attached to buildings and\r\n     free standing signs.  An offsite sign may be located on\r\n     a building rooftop, but because the product, good, or\r\n     service it advertises is not available at the sign's\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nappreciation for the difficulties faced by municipalities in this\r\n\ncomplicated  area,   we  nonetheless  conclude  that   the  First\r\n\nAmendment  bars enforcement  of the  challenged ordinance  in the\r\n\ncircumstances present here.\r\n\n                      I. Factual Background\r                                                     \r\n\n     Plaintiff   Ackerley   Communications  is   a  Massachusetts\r\n\nbillboard  company  that  has  operated  an  outdoor  advertising\r\n\nbusiness for more than 100  years.  In the City of  Cambridge, it\r\n\nmaintains  46  signs on  32 separate  structures.   All  of these\r\n\nbillboards became nonconforming  when Cambridge amended a  zoning\r\n\nordinance  in 1991  to tighten  the restrictions  on the  height,\r\n\nsize, number and  location of signs that may  be displayed in the\r\n\ncity.2    Ackerley,  hoping  to  find  protection  in  the  First\r\n\nAmendment, has  displayed only  noncommercial messages since  the\r\n\namended ordinance went into effect.\r\n\n     The  ordinance itself  makes  no distinctions  based on  the\r\n\nmessages displayed on the signs.  Such differential protection is\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     location, it is classified as offsite.  For example, if\r\n     a sign advertising the products available at Joe's\r\n     Hardware is located atop the Parise Cafe building,\r\n     Joe's sign is offsite.\r\n\nIn this opinion, we use the terms on-premise and off-premise\r\ninterchangeably with onsite and offsite.\r\n\n     2 Article 7.000 of the Zoning Ordinances of the City of\r\nCambridge provides, inter alia, that four categories of\r                                        \r\nnonconforming signs must be removed within four years from the\r\nstatute's enactment, or from the first date that the sign became\r\nnonconforming.  The signs required to be removed are those on\r\nrooftops, freestanding signs exceeding 30 square feet, wall signs\r\nexceeding 60 square feet and projecting signs exceeding 10 square\r\nfeet.    7.18.1.  All of Ackerley's signs fall into at least one\r\nof these categories.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nconferred instead  by a  state statute, the  Massachusetts Zoning\r\n\nAct,  Mass.  Gen. L.  ch. 40A,     6, which  mandates grandfather\r\n\nprotection for all nonconforming uses -- including signs  -- that\r\n\nare in  existence at the  time a zoning  ordinance is enacted  or\r\n\namended.   The  statute excludes  from such  protection, however,\r\n\nbillboards, signs  and other  advertising devices subject  to the\r\n\njurisdiction  of  the  Massachusetts  Outdoor  Advertising  Board\r\n\n(OAB).  The OAB regulates so-called \"off-premise\" signs.3\r\n\n     The combined  effect of the  local ordinance and  state law,\r\n\ntherefore, is to protect signs that do not conform to the amended\r\n\nCambridge  ordinance only if they carry onsite messages.  None of\r                                   \r\n\nAckerley's billboards are grandfathered under this scheme because\r\n\nall of its messages  are offsite ones -- i.e., they are unrelated\r\n\nto  the  property  on  which  they  sit.    Thus,  Ackerley's  46\r\n\nnoncommercial, off-premises  messages must be taken  down while a\r\n\nlarge number of nonconforming commercial signs are protected.\r\n\n     Cambridge  officials  recognized the  limited nature  of the\r\n\ngrandfather  provision, and, indeed,  endorsed its preference for\r\n\nonsite signs, finding:\r\n\n     Nonconforming  off-premise  signs, which  traditionally\r\n     have been used primarily to  advertise commercial goods\r\n     and services not available on the same premises, have a\r\n     significantly greater adverse aesthetic impact  than on\r\n     premises signs  because of their larger  sizes, greater\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3 Ackerley accurately points out that the descriptive terms\r\n\"off-premise\" and \"on-premise\" can be misleading when used to\r\nmodify the word \"sign\", since the applicable category is\r\ndetermined not by a sign's location, but by its message.  As\r                                                                 \r\nnoted supra, at note 1, a sign attached to a building can carry\r                     \r\neither off-premise or on-premise messages.  \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n     heights,  less  attractive  appearances,   and/or  more\r\n     intrusive locations.\r\n\nZoning  Ordinance  Article  7.000,    7.11.1(F).    The  Findings\r\n\nsection  of  the  ordinance  further states  that  \"[t]he  public\r\n\ninterest is served  by use of signs by businesses and services to\r\n\nidentify  their  premises,  or  the products  or  services  there\r\n\navailable, or  to display noncommercial  messages.\"  Id.  at (G).\r                                                                  \r\n\nThe  importance  of  noncommercial  messages is  reflected  in  a\r\n\n\"substitution provision\"  in the ordinance,  which provides  that\r\n\n\"[a]ny  sign permitted under this Article may contain, in lieu of\r\n\nor  in addition  to any  other copy, any  noncommercial message.\"\r\n\nArticle 7.000,   7.17.\r\n\n     Consistent with this scheme,  when the ordinance's four-year\r\n\ngrace period  expired in  1995, Cambridge informed  Ackerley that\r\n\nits signs would have to come down.  Ackerley sought a preliminary\r\n\ninjunction barring enforcement of  the ordinance, arguing that it\r\n\nviolates  the  First Amendment  because  it favors  nonconforming\r\n\nsigns  that carry  commercial  messages over  similar signs  that\r\n\ncarry  noncommercial  messages.4     The  district  court  denied\r\n\ninjunctive relief.  It found that Ackerley had not demonstrated a\r\n\nlikelihood of success  on the  merits because  the ordinance  \"in\r\n\neffect[] distinguishes between on-site and off-site  signs, which\r\n\nis  permissible, and  not  between commercial  and non-commercial\r\n\nmessages.\"\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4 Ackerley also alleged a Fifth Amendment takings claim,\r\nwhich is not before us at this time.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n     Ackerley consequently  filed this  appeal, arguing  that the\r\n\ndistrict  court  misapplied relevant  First  Amendment  law.   It\r\n\ncontends that the Supreme Court's decision in Metromedia, Inc. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSan  Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981), and  our own decision in City of\r                                                                           \r\n\nSomerville,  878  F.2d  at  513, require  a  conclusion  that the\r                    \r\n\nCambridge  ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to Ackerley's\r\n\nsigns.\r\n\n     Although this case comes to  us as an appeal of a  denial of\r\n\npreliminary relief,  both parties  at oral  argument urged  us to\r\n\nresolve the dispute on its merits  because the issue is purely  a\r\n\nlegal  one that needs no  further record development.   We accept\r\n\nthe invitation  to make  the ultimate determination,  and proceed\r\n\nwith our analysis from that perspective.   \r\n\n                          II. Discussion\r                                                  \r\n\nA. Background\r                       \r\n\n     The City of Cambridge has been working for a number of years\r\n\nto  improve  its aesthetic  environment through  the increasingly\r\n\nrestrictive  regulation of signs.  The 1991 revisions to its sign\r\n\nordinance  for the  first time required  removal of  certain non-\r\n\nconforming signs.  Although the ordinance affects many more signs\r\n\nthan  just  the  large,  visually  demanding  --  some would  say\r\n\noffensive -- ones that most of us would identify as billboards, a\r\n\ncomprehensive  report prepared  in  connection  with the  revised\r\n\nordinance  reveals  that  they   are  the  city's  most  pressing\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nconcern.5   Billboards  typically  carry offsite  messages.   The\r\n\nstate's  grandfathering provision --  exempting nonconforming on-\r                                                                          \r\n\npremise  signs  -- therefore  nicely  dovetails  with Cambridge's\r\n\npriority to eliminate  billboards as soon  as possible.6   Onsite\r\n\nsigns,  most of which are business signs, may stay; offsite signs\r\n\n--  many of  which  at the  moment  in Cambridge  are  billboards\r\n\ncarrying noncommercial messages -- must go.    \r\n\n     Ackerley offers two primary reasons why this scheme violates\r\n\nthe  First  Amendment.    First, it  claims  that  the  Cambridge\r\n\nordinance  directly  conflicts  with  our  decision  in  City  of\r                                                                           \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5 The report on the Cambridge sign environment concluded\r\nthat off-premise signs -- a term it equated with billboards --\r\nwere more troubling than onsite signs because, inter alia, they\r                                                                   \r\ndominate the surrounding environment, both visually and\r\nphysically, and are not likely to be removed except as the result\r\nof a total redevelopment of the site on which they are found. \r\nThe report found that on-premise signs, in contrast, have a more\r\n\"limited and contained\" aesthetic impact because \"they are placed\r\nlow on their host buildings, they are obscured from afar by\r\nstreet trees and almost without exception they do not approach\r\nthe sheer size and dominance of off-premise signs.\"  In addition,\r\nthe report stated that onsite signs were likely to be less\r\npermanent, since businesses are likely to change hands and new\r\nsigns would not be grandfathered.\r\n\n     6 For purposes of our discussion, we treat the state\r\ngrandfathering provision as part-and-parcel of the Cambridge\r\nordinance, and certain of our references to \"the Cambridge\r\nordinance\" will assume that the grandfathering provision is\r\ncontained within it.  Indeed, as noted supra, at pages 4-5, the\r                                                      \r\nordinance seems to incorporate the state grandfather provision as\r\npart of its regulatory scheme.\r\n       We emphasize that the validity of the state statute, as an\r\nindependent matter, is not a question before us.  The issue we\r\nmust decide is whether Cambridge may enforce its sign ordinance\r\nto require Ackerley to remove its billboards.  As Cambridge's\r\ncounsel acknowledged at oral argument, the impact of the state\r\ngrandfathering provision is relevant to that inquiry regardless\r\nof the statute's constitutionality.\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nSomerville,  where we  found  the ordinance  to be  impermissible\r                    \r\n\nbased on a grandfathering provision that exempted only signs that\r\n\nhad  carried  no  offsite   commercial  speech  during  the  year\r\n\npreceding  the  ordinance's enactment.    We held  that  \"[i]t is\r\n\nwithout  question that the government may not impose a penalty --\r\n\nin this case, denying the right to continue speaking  by means of\r\n\nnonconforming  signs --  because of  a  person's constitutionally\r\n\nprotected past speech.\"  878 F.2d at 519.  \r\n\n     Ackerley contends  that Cambridge's ordinance,  when applied\r\n\nin  light of the state statute, suffers from essentially the same\r\n\nflaw:  the  right to  use nonconforming  signs  in the  future to\r\n\nexpress  noncommercial  messages  is  given  by  the substitution\r\n\nprovision only to certain speakers, based on their past speech --\r\n\nin this instance, to those who were displaying onsite messages on\r\n\nthe  day the  ordinance  was enacted.    Ackerley maintains  that\r\n\ndistributing  the future right to  speak in a  certain way (i.e.,\r\n\nthrough  large,  nonconforming signs)  based  on  the content  of\r\n\nearlier speech  is  impermissible whether  the restriction  looks\r\n\nback a  year in time,  as it  did in Somerville,  or only  a day.\r\n\nThis must be so, it asserts, because the practical effect  of the\r\n\ntwo ordinances  is identical; both  reserve the right  to display\r\n\nnoncommercial  messages  primarily  to   a  limited  category  of\r\n\nspeakers, business owners.\r\n\n     Ackerley's second  theory is  that the ordinance  is invalid\r\n\nbecause it imposes an impermissible content-based  restriction on\r\n\nspeech: whether a sign may remain is determined by the message it\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ncarries.      Because   most   content-based   restrictions   are\r\n\npresumptively  invalid, see City of  Ladue v. Gilleo,  114 S. Ct.\r                                                              \r\n\n2038,   2047   (1994)   (O'Connor,  J.,   concurring);   National\r                                                                           \r\n\nAmusements,  Inc. v.

Freeman, 504\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 191, 211 (1992) (\"[I]t is the rare case in which . . . a law\r\n\nsurvives strict scrutiny.\").\r\n\n     Cambridge responds that enforcement  of its ordinance is not\r\n\ninconsistent with City of  Somerville because the regulation does\r                                               \r\n\nnot  use \"past speech\" as  the distinguishing criterion.   In its\r\n\nview, the grandfather provision permissibly distinguishes between\r\n\ncategories of signs (onsite vs. offsite), and  such a distinction\r\n\ninevitably  must relate  to  the  signs  as  they  existed  at  a\r\n\nparticular point in  time.  Cambridge  further contends that  its\r\n\nordinance  is a  valid content-neutral  regulation that  does not\r\n\nrequire strict scrutiny.\r\n\n     Under  traditional First  Amendment  analysis,  we  probably\r\n\nshould address  as a threshold matter  whether the onsite/offsite\r\n\ngrandfathering  restriction is  a  content-based regulation  that\r\n\ntriggers strict scrutiny.7   See  City of  Ladue, 114  S.

The  substitution\r\n\nprovision guarantees that noncommercial messages may be placed on\r\n\nany exempted sign.   What this means, however, is  that Cambridge\r\n\nis  choosing which  speakers may  in the  future display  offsite\r\n\nnoncommercial messages on nonconforming signs in the way  City of\r                                                                           \r\n\nSomerville  held was impermissible --  by looking to past speech.\r                    \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     12 Indeed, although the city's sign report emphasized that,\r\n\"almost without exception,\" on-premise signs have less of a\r\nnegative visual and aesthetic impact than billboards, the report\r\nacknowledged that \"[m]any on-premise signs are of course\r\ndisappointing\" and \"can at times be too large, too high, too\r\nvisually loud.\"\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nOnly those speakers whose signs displayed onsite messages on  the\r\n\nday  of the  ordinance's enactment  may substitute  noncommercial\r\n\nmessages  for the previous  ones.

See 878 F.2d at 519-20.\r                                    \r\n\n     Although  those  dangers  may  seem  less  likely  from  the\r\n\nCambridge  regulation  because  it does  not,  like Somerville's,\r\n\ndisqualify speakers based  on only  a single day's  display of  a\r\n\nnon-preferred  message  (i.e.,  offsite  commercial)  during  the\r\n\ncourse of a  year, the Cambridge scheme's reliance on the date of\r\n\nenactment nevertheless eliminates speakers from future  access to\r\n\na  particular medium based on their past choice of lawful speech.\r\n\nIf  it is impermissible to  assign future speech  rights based on\r\n\nthe  content of past  speech, the amount of  past speech does not\r\n\nstrike  us as significant.  The chilling effect that results from\r\n\nlinking  future speech to past speech exists even if the pressure\r\n\nto conform one's speech is compressed into a short time frame.\r\n\n     Moreover, the division drawn here  between those who may and\r\n\nmay not use nonconforming signs in the future, for the most part,\r\n\nisolates  business and property owners as a privileged class.  As\r\n\nCambridge  freely   acknowledges,  onsite  signs   typically  are\r\n\ncommercial in  nature.  Because the  substitution provision gives\r\n\nthe  right to  display  noncommercial  messages on  nonconforming\r\n\nsigns only  to those  individuals whose signs  previously carried\r\n\nonsite messages, the primary effect of the substitution provision\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nis  to give only commercial speakers the option of changing their\r\n\nsigns to noncommercial messages.\r\n\n     Giving an identifiable  group virtually exclusive access  to\r\n\nthe use of a  medium is wholly inconsistent with  First Amendment\r\n\nprinciples;  it is  doubtful that  the noncommercial  messages of\r\n\ninterest  to business  owners  would reflect  as  broad a  cross-\r\n\nsection  of viewpoints as might  occur in a  marketplace in which\r\n\nevery speaker has  equal footing  to speak.13   Indeed, the  case\r\n\nlaw makes it  clear that even  more problematic than the  loss of\r\n\nall noncommercial messages would be the selective preservation of\r\n\nthem.  See  Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.  v. FCC, 114 S.

A grandfather provision  could, for  example,\r\n\nexclude  from  grandfathering all  signs  over  a certain  square\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     15 The substitution provision does not cure the problem\r\nbecause it does not affect eligibility for exemption.  As in\r                                                \r\nSomerville, a speaker's willingness to display noncommercial\r\nmessages in the future is insufficient to qualify that speaker's\r\nsigns for exemption; eligibility for future use is based on past\r                                                                          \r\nspeech.\r\n     Indeed, the substitution provision appears to lead to a\r\npotentially bizarre operation of the sign ordinance.  It seems\r\nthat Ackerley could have protected its billboards by changing\r\nthem to onsite commercial messages before the ordinance went into\r\neffect.  Although the onsite messages available for some of the\r\nsigns likely would be limited, creative possibilities -- such as\r\n\"No Trespassing\" or \"This Property Not for Sale\" -- seem to\r\nexist.  The substitution provision apparently would have allowed\r\nAckerley to revert to noncommercial messages the next day.  Such\r\na scheme strikes us as irrational.  In addition, First Amendment\r\nvalues are inverted: Ackerley's signs would be protected if they\r\ncontained (onsite) commercial messages but not if they contained\r\n(offsite) noncommercial ones.\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nfootage on the  ground that the larger the  sign, the greater the\r\n\naesthetic  harm.16   Indeed, Cambridge's  own ordinance  includes\r\n\nsuch a provision.\r\n\n                         III. Conclusion\r                                                  \r\n\n     The  Cambridge ordinance  contains a  severability provision\r\n\nstating  that,  in  the event  some  portion  of  it is  declared\r\n\ninvalid,  it is  the  City's intent  that  the remainder  of  the\r\n\nordinance continue in full force  and effect.  We do not  in this\r\n\ndecision rule  unlawful any particular section  of the ordinance.\r\n\nRather,  because  the  constitutional  problem   stems  from  the\r\n\ninterplay  of the ordinance and the state provision, we hold only\r\n\nthat  Cambridge  may  not  require removal  of  signs  displaying\r\n\nnoncommercial  messages based  on their exclusion  from exemption\r\n\nunder the state provision.\r\n\n     Reversed and remanded.\r                                     \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     16 \"Such an ordinance would fall directly within the time,\r\nplace, or manner category of speech regulations, and would need\r\nto meet the three-part test established for content-neutral\r\nregulations.

In many respects, this is a case of deja vu.   Seven years ago, the same plaintiff successfully challenged a similar sign ordinance as violative of the First Amendment.   See Ackerley Communications of Massachusetts v. City of Somerville, 878 F.2d 513 (1st Cir.1989).   Although the defending municipality has changed--Cambridge now replaces its neighbor Somerville--the central issue remains the same:  the validity of distinctions drawn between \"onsite\" and \"offsite\" signs and between commercial and noncommercial messages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> 1]  With appreciation for the difficulties faced by municipalities in this complicated area, we nonetheless conclude that the First Amendment bars enforcement of the challenged ordinance in the circumstances present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Ackerley Communications is a Massachusetts billboard company that has operated an outdoor advertising business for more than 100 years.   In the City of Cambridge, it maintains 46 signs on 32 separate structures.   All of these billboards became nonconforming when Cambridge amended a zoning ordinance in 1991 to tighten the restrictions on the height, size, number and location of signs that may be displayed in the city.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Ackerley, hoping to find protection in the First Amendment, has displayed only noncommercial messages since the amended ordinance went into effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinance itself makes no distinctions based on the messages displayed on the signs.   Such differential protection is conferred instead by a state statute, the Massachusetts Zoning Act, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   40A, &#167; 6, which mandates grandfather protection for all nonconforming uses--including signs--that are in existence at the time a zoning ordinance is enacted or amended.   The statute excludes from such protection, however, billboards, signs and other advertising devices subject to the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Outdoor Advertising Board (OAB).   The OAB regulates so-called \"off-premise\" signs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The combined effect of the local ordinance and state law, therefore, is to protect signs that do not conform to the amended Cambridge ordinance only if they carry onsite messages.   None of Ackerley's billboards are grandfathered under this scheme because all of its messages are offsite ones--i.e., they are unrelated to the property on which they sit.   Thus, Ackerley's 46 noncommercial, off-premises messages must be taken down while a large number of nonconforming commercial signs are protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge officials recognized the limited nature of the grandfather provision, and, indeed, endorsed its preference for onsite signs, finding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Nonconforming off-premise signs, which traditionally have been used primarily to advertise commercial goods and services not available on the same premises, have a significantly greater adverse aesthetic impact than on premises signs because of their larger sizes, greater heights, less attractive appearances, and/or more intrusive locations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zoning Ordinance Article 7.000, &#167; 7.11.1(F).   The Findings section of the ordinance further states that \"[t]he public interest is served by use of signs by businesses and services to identify their premises, or the products or services there available, or to display noncommercial messages.\"   Id. at (G).   The importance of noncommercial messages is reflected in a \"substitution provision\" in the ordinance, which provides that \"[a]ny sign permitted under this Article may contain, in lieu of or in addition to any other copy, any noncommercial message.\"   Article 7.000, &#167; 7.17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with this scheme, when the ordinance's four-year grace period expired in 1995, Cambridge informed Ackerley that its signs would have to come down.   Ackerley sought a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the ordinance, arguing that it violates the First Amendment because it favors nonconforming signs that carry commercial messages over similar signs that carry noncommercial messages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court denied injunctive relief.   It found that Ackerley had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits because the ordinance \"in effect[ ] distinguishes between on-site and off-site signs, which is permissible, and not between commercial and non-commercial messages.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley consequently filed this appeal, arguing that the district court misapplied relevant First Amendment law.   It contends that the Supreme Court's decision in  Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981), and our own decision in City of Somerville, 878 F.2d at 513, require a conclusion that the Cambridge ordinance is unconstitutional as applied to Ackerley's signs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although this case comes to us as an appeal of a denial of preliminary relief, both parties at oral argument urged us to resolve the dispute on its merits because the issue is purely a legal one that needs no further record development.   We accept the invitation to make the ultimate determination, and proceed with our analysis from that perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p>A. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Cambridge has been working for a number of years to improve its aesthetic environment through the increasingly restrictive regulation of signs.   The 1991 revisions to its sign ordinance for the first time required removal of certain non-conforming signs.   Although the ordinance affects many more signs than just the large, visually demanding--some would say offensive--ones that most of us would identify as billboards, a comprehensive report prepared in connection with the revised ordinance reveals that they are the city's most pressing concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Billboards typically carry offsite messages.   The state's grandfathering provision--exempting nonconforming on-premise signs--therefore nicely dovetails with Cambridge's priority to eliminate billboards as soon as possible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Onsite signs, most of which are business signs, may stay;  offsite signs--many of which at the moment in Cambridge are billboards carrying noncommercial messages--must go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley offers two primary reasons why this scheme violates the First Amendment.   First, it claims that the Cambridge ordinance directly conflicts with our decision in City of Somerville, where we found the ordinance to be impermissible based on a grandfathering provision that exempted only signs that had carried no offsite commercial speech during the year preceding the ordinance's enactment.   We held that \"[i]t is without question that the government may not impose a penalty--in this case, denying the right to continue speaking by means of nonconforming signs--because of a person's constitutionally protected past speech.\"  878 F.2d at 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley contends that Cambridge's ordinance, when applied in light of the state statute, suffers from essentially the same flaw:  the right to use nonconforming signs in the future to express noncommercial messages is given by the substitution provision only to certain speakers, based on their past speech--in this instance, to those who were displaying onsite messages on the day the ordinance was enacted.   Ackerley maintains that distributing the future right to speak in a certain way (i.e., through large, nonconforming signs) based on the content of earlier speech is impermissible whether the restriction looks back a year in time, as it did in Somerville, or only a day.   This must be so, it asserts, because the practical effect of the two ordinances is identical;  both reserve the right to display noncommercial messages primarily to a limited category of speakers, business owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley's second theory is that the ordinance is invalid because it imposes an impermissible content-based restriction on speech:  whether a sign may remain is determined by the message it carries.   Because most content-based restrictions are presumptively invalid, see City of Ladue v. Gilleo, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2038, 2047, 129 L.Ed.2d 36 (1994) (O'Connor, J., concurring);  National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 736 (1st Cir.1995), and subject to strict scrutiny, even Cambridge seems to acknowledge that, if this traditional content-based inquiry applies, its ordinance would fail.   See Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 211, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1857-58, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992) (\"[I]t is the rare case in which ... a law survives strict scrutiny.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge responds that enforcement of its ordinance is not inconsistent with City of Somerville because the regulation does not use \"past speech\" as the distinguishing criterion.   In its view, the grandfather provision permissibly distinguishes between categories of signs (onsite vs. offsite), and such a distinction inevitably must relate to the signs as they existed at a particular point in time.   Cambridge further contends that its ordinance is a valid content-neutral regulation that does not require strict scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under traditional First Amendment analysis, we probably should address as a threshold matter whether the onsite/offsite grandfathering restriction is a content-based regulation that triggers strict scrutiny.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  See City of Ladue, --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2047 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\"The normal inquiry that our doctrine dictates is, first, to determine whether a regulation is content-based or content-neutral, and then, based on the answer to that question, to apply the proper level of scrutiny.\");  National Amusements, 43 F.3d at 736.   We choose to sidestep that difficult question, however, because we conclude that the Cambridge scheme suffers from two readily identifiable First Amendment flaws that bar its enforcement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>B. Distinguishing Among Categories of Noncommercial Speech</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While not facially preferring commercial messages to noncommercial ones--a preference barred by Metromedia--the Cambridge scheme does draw a line between two types of noncommercial speech--onsite and offsite messages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  This line has the effect of disadvantaging the category of noncommercial speech that is probably the most highly protected:  the expression of ideas.   The only signs containing noncommercial messages that are exempted are those relating to the premises on which they stand, which inevitably will mean signs identifying nonprofit institutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its report, the city emphasizes the important role that on-premise signs play \"in promoting activities important to the well-being of the City.\"  But with rare exceptions, the First Amendment does not permit Cambridge to value certain types of noncommercial speech more highly than others,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> particularly when the speech disfavored includes some--like political speech--that is at the core of the First Amendment's value system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  See Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 514-15, 101 S.Ct. at 2896-97 (\"Although the city may distinguish between the relative value of different categories of commercial speech, the city does not have the same range of choice in the area of noncommercial speech to evaluate the strength of, or distinguish between, various communicative interests....  With respect to noncommercial speech, the city may not choose the appropriate subjects for public discourse ....\");  see also Rappa v. New Castle County, 18 F.3d 1043, 1063 (3d Cir.1994) (\"The rule against content discrimination forces the government to limit all speech--including speech the government does not want to limit--if it is going to restrict any speech at all.   By deterring the government from exempting speech the government prefers, the Supreme Court has helped to ensure that government only limits any speech when it is quite certain that it desires to do so.\");  National Advertising Co. v. City of Orange, 861 F.2d 246, 248-49 (9th Cir.1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge does not suggest that there is an aesthetic difference between a \"Remember to Vote\" message and one announcing the location of the public library;  it simply maintains that the physical characteristics of \"Public Library\" signs are more likely to be less objectionable because they tend to be smaller and less obtrusive than most signs carrying offsite messages.   The ordinance, however, gives protection based on the message and not the physical characteristics, and it is that distinction that the city must justify.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Perhaps if a total ban of signs were at issue, signs identifying buildings would be a permissible limited exception because, like traffic and safety signs, they would serve a substantial need that could not be met in any other way.   In this case, however, we consider not a total ban, but only restrictions on size, style and location.   The identification interest for nonconforming signs cannot satisfy even intermediate scrutiny when the ordinance presumes that identification can be accomplished adequately in the future by smaller signs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>C. The City of Somerville Problem:  Penalizing Past Speech</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulation's second flaw arises from the manner in which it seeks to protect ideological speech.   The substitution provision guarantees that noncommercial messages may be placed on any exempted sign.   What this means, however, is that Cambridge is choosing which speakers may in the future display offsite noncommercial messages on nonconforming signs in the way City of Somerville held was impermissible--by looking to past speech.   Only those speakers whose signs displayed onsite messages on the day of the ordinance's enactment may substitute noncommercial messages for the previous ones.   We explored at some length in City of Somerville the dangers of awarding future speech rights based on past speech.   See 878 F.2d at 519-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although those dangers may seem less likely from the Cambridge regulation because it does not, like Somerville's, disqualify speakers based on only a single day's display of a non-preferred message (i.e., offsite commercial) during the course of a year, the Cambridge scheme's reliance on the date of enactment nevertheless eliminates speakers from future access to a particular medium based on their past choice of lawful speech.   If it is impermissible to assign future speech rights based on the content of past speech, the amount of past speech does not strike us as significant.   The chilling effect that results from linking future speech to past speech exists even if the pressure to conform one's speech is compressed into a short time frame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the division drawn here between those who may and may not use nonconforming signs in the future, for the most part, isolates business and property owners as a privileged class.   As Cambridge freely acknowledges, onsite signs typically are commercial in nature.   Because the substitution provision gives the right to display noncommercial messages on nonconforming signs only to those individuals whose signs previously carried onsite messages, the primary effect of the substitution provision is to give only commercial speakers the option of changing their signs to noncommercial messages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giving an identifiable group virtually exclusive access to the use of a medium is wholly inconsistent with First Amendment principles;  it is doubtful that the noncommercial messages of interest to business owners would reflect as broad a cross-section of viewpoints as might occur in a marketplace in which every speaker has equal footing to speak.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Indeed, the case law makes it clear that even more problematic than the loss of all noncommercial messages would be the selective preservation of them.   See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, --- U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2476, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994) (\"Under the First Amendment, it is normally not within the government's power to decide who may speak and who may not, at least on private property or in traditional public fora.\");<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Somerville, 878 F.2d at 518 (\"Even if a complete ban on nonconforming signs would be permissible, we must consider carefully the government's decision to pick and choose among the speakers permitted to use such signs.\")  (citing and quoting First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 784-85, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1420-21, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978) (\"In the realm of protected speech, the legislature is constitutionally disqualified from dictating ... the speakers who may address a public issue.\")).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What made this case particularly difficult is that the \"offsite\" label, in practical terms, embraces not only most noncommercial signs but also most of the worst aesthetic offenders.   In addition, most offsite signs tend to display commercial messages;  Ackerley's present configuration in Cambridge is a deliberate departure from its usual mixture of messages (15% noncommercial) in order to place itself in the best possible position to retain use of its sign faces.   Limiting grandfather protection to onsite signs thus is an effective means of accomplishing the city's legitimate objective of improving aesthetics, and typically would result in the loss primarily of offsite commercial messages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact remains, however, that the grandfathering benefit is conferred in content-based terms that have no aesthetic justification and effectively penalizes a category of speakers based on their prior choice of message.   In addition, nearly all of the sign owners privileged to display offsite noncommercial messages on nonconforming signs may be expected to share similar views on certain matters of public interest.   We hold that the First Amendment does not allow Cambridge to achieve its aesthetic objective by allocating the right to speak in this way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Remedial Option</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that our conclusion puts Cambridge in a peculiar position because the content-based grandfathering derives from state law.   Relief from this disability condition is beyond the scope of this court's power in this case.   Any change in state law probably must be left to the workings of the political process.   As we noted in Somerville, it is possible to construct a justifiable, content-neutral grandfather provision that will advance the city's \"dual objectives of eliminating most billboards while giving substantial protection to onsite signs,\" 878 F.2d at 522.   A grandfather provision could, for example, exclude from grandfathering all signs over a certain square footage on the ground that the larger the sign, the greater the aesthetic harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Indeed, Cambridge's own ordinance includes such a provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cambridge ordinance contains a severability provision stating that, in the event some portion of it is declared invalid, it is the City's intent that the remainder of the ordinance continue in full force and effect.   We do not in this decision rule unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.   Rather, because the constitutional problem stems from the interplay of the ordinance and the state provision, we hold only that Cambridge may not require removal of signs displaying noncommercial messages based on their exclusion from exemption under the state provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We repeat our explanation of the onsite/offsite distinction from City of Somerville, 878 F.2d at 513 n. 1:</p>\n        <p>An onsite sign carries a message that bears some relationship to the activities conducted on the premises where the sign is located.   For example, an onsite sign may simply identify a business or agency (\"Joe's Hardware\" or \"YMCA\"), or it may advertise a product or service available at that location (\"Budweiser Beer\" at Parise's Cafe or child care at the Lutheran Church).   Depending upon the business or agency, the message on the sign may be deemed either commercial or noncommercial.   An offsite sign--the category into which most billboards fit--carries a message unrelated to its particular location.   These signs also may display either commercial or noncommercial messages.   For example, an offsite sign may advertise \"Great Gifts at Kappy's Liquors,\" with Kappy's Liquors being located at some distance from the sign, or it may say \"No one should be left out in the cold.   Write:  Citizens Energy Corp.\"</p>\n        <p>Thus, the onsite/offsite distinction is not a distinction between signs attached to buildings and free standing signs.   An offsite sign may be located on a building rooftop, but because the product, good, or service it advertises is not available at the sign's location, it is classified as offsite.   For example, if a sign advertising the products available at Joe's Hardware is located atop the Parise Cafe building, Joe's sign is offsite.</p>\n        <p>In this opinion, we use the terms on-premise and off-premise interchangeably with onsite and offsite.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Article 7.000 of the Zoning Ordinances of the City of Cambridge provides, inter alia, that four categories of nonconforming signs must be removed within four years from the statute's enactment, or from the first date that the sign became nonconforming.   The signs required to be removed are those on rooftops, freestanding signs exceeding 30 square feet, wall signs exceeding 60 square feet and projecting signs exceeding 10 square feet. &#167; 7.18.1.  All of Ackerley's signs fall into at least one of these categories</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Ackerley accurately points out that the descriptive terms \"off-premise\" and \"on-premise\" can be misleading when used to modify the word \"sign\", since the applicable category is determined not by a sign's location, but by its message.   As noted supra, at note 1, a sign attached to a building can carry either off-premise or on-premise messages</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Ackerley also alleged a Fifth Amendment takings claim, which is not before us at this time</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The report on the Cambridge sign environment concluded that off-premise signs--a term it equated with billboards--were more troubling than onsite signs because, inter alia, they dominate the surrounding environment, both visually and physically, and are not likely to be removed except as the result of a total redevelopment of the site on which they are found.   The report found that on-premise signs, in contrast, have a more \"limited and contained\" aesthetic impact because \"they are placed low on their host buildings, they are obscured from afar by street trees and almost without exception they do not approach the sheer size and dominance of off-premise signs.\"   In addition, the report stated that onsite signs were likely to be less permanent, since businesses are likely to change hands and new signs would not be grandfathered</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> For purposes of our discussion, we treat the state grandfathering provision as part-and-parcel of the Cambridge ordinance, and certain of our references to \"the Cambridge ordinance\" will assume that the grandfathering provision is contained within it.   Indeed, as noted supra, at pages 34-35, the ordinance seems to incorporate the state grandfather provision as part of its regulatory scheme</p>\n        <p>We emphasize that the validity of the state statute, as an independent matter, is not a question before us.   The issue we must decide is whether Cambridge may enforce its sign ordinance to require Ackerley to remove its billboards.   As Cambridge's counsel acknowledged at oral argument, the impact of the state grandfathering provision is relevant to that inquiry regardless of the statute's constitutionality.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In \"commonsense\" terms, the distinction surely is content-based because determining whether a sign may stay up or must come down requires consideration of the message it carries.   The Supreme Court made such an observation in City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.S. 410, 427-31, 113 S.Ct. 1505, 1516-17, 123 L.Ed.2d 99 (1993), which involved a city policy banning newsracks carrying commercial handbills but not those carrying newspapers.   The Court noted:</p>\n        <p>Under the city's newsrack policy, whether any particular newsrack falls within the ban is determined by the content of the publication resting inside that newsrack.   Thus, by any commonsense understanding of the term, the ban in this case is \"content-based.\"</p>\n        <p>See also National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 738 (1st Cir.1995);  Whitton v. City of Gladstone, Mo., 54 F.3d 1400, 1403-04 (8th Cir.1995) (\"The Supreme Court has held that a restriction on speech is content-based when the message conveyed determines whether the speech is subject to the restriction.\").</p>\n        <p>Cambridge acknowledges that the onsite/offsite distinction indirectly has a content-based effect because most on-premise signs are commercial in nature and most noncommercial messages are off-premise.   In Cambridge, the disadvantage to noncommercial speech is magnified because of Ackerley's decision to change all of its billboards to noncommercial messages.</p>\n        <p>Several courts, however, have found the offsite/onsite distinction to be essentially content-neutral, at least for the purpose of determining the correct standard.   See, e.g., Rappa v. New Castle County, 18 F.3d 1043, 1067 (3d Cir.1994);  Messer v. City of Douglasville, Ga., 975 F.2d 1505, 1509 (11th Cir.1992).   In Rappa, a divided court noted that \"[f]avoring onsite over off-site speech probably leads to the effect of favoring commercial speech over non-commercial speech as most conspicuous onsite speech is probably commercial, but this effect is too attenuated for us to take into account.\"  18 F.3d at 1056 n. 19.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Ackerley does not contest the city's authority to require removal of nonconforming signs that display offsite commercial messages.   See Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 512, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 2894-95, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (a city lawfully may exempt signs bearing onsite commercial messages without also exempting those bearing offsite commercial messages)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> For example, an ordinance that exempted only highway speed and directional signs, and municipal street signs, probably could survive strict scrutiny.

The ordinance also permits noncommercial messages on conforming signs, which are those that do not exceed ten square feet in area.   At issue here, however, is the selective grant of the right to speak through the more effective medium of large, nonconforming signs</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> The Court in Turner Broadcasting further noted that time, place and manner restrictions are permissible in large part because they apply to all speakers.  --- U.S. at ----, 114 S.Ct. at 2476.   It continued:</p>\n        <p>Laws that treat all speakers equally are relatively poor tools for controlling public debate, and their very generality creates a substantial political check that prevents them from being unduly burdensome.   Laws that single out particular speakers are substantially more dangerous, even when they do not draw explicit content distinctions.</p>\n        <p>Id.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> The substitution provision does not cure the problem because it does not affect eligibility for exemption.   As in Somerville, a speaker's willingness to display noncommercial messages in the future is insufficient to qualify that speaker's signs for exemption;  eligibility for future use is based on past speech</p>\n        <p>Indeed, the substitution provision appears to lead to a potentially bizarre operation of the sign ordinance.   It seems that Ackerley could have protected its billboards by changing them to onsite commercial messages before the ordinance went into effect.   Although the onsite messages available for some of the signs likely would be limited, creative possibilities--such as \"No Trespassing\" or \"This Property Not for Sale\"--seem to exist.   The substitution provision apparently would have allowed Ackerley to revert to noncommercial messages the next day.   Such a scheme strikes us as irrational.   In addition, First Amendment values are inverted:  Ackerley's signs would be protected if they contained (onsite) commercial messages but not if they contained (offsite) noncommercial ones.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> \"Such an ordinance would fall directly within the time, place, or manner category of speech regulations, and would need to meet the three-part test established for content-neutral regulations.

In many respects, this is a case of deja vu.   Seven years ago, the same plaintiff successfully challenged a similar sign ordinance as violative of the First Amendment.   See Ackerley Communications of Massachusetts v. City of Somerville, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"525551\"><a href=\"/opinion/525551/ackerley-communications-of-massachusetts-inc-v-city-of-somerville/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1989).   Although the defending municipality has changed--Cambridge now replaces its neighbor Somerville--the central issue remains the same:  the validity of distinctions drawn between \"onsite\" and \"offsite\" signs and between commercial and noncommercial messages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> 1]  With appreciation for the difficulties faced by municipalities in this complicated area, we nonetheless conclude that the First Amendment bars enforcement of the challenged ordinance in the circumstances present here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff Ackerley Communications is a Massachusetts billboard company that has operated an outdoor advertising business for more than 100 years.   In the City of Cambridge, it maintains 46 signs on 32 separate structures.   All of these billboards became nonconforming when Cambridge amended a zoning ordinance in 1991 to tighten the restrictions on the height, size, number and location of signs that may be displayed in the city.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Ackerley, hoping to find protection in the First Amendment, has displayed only noncommercial messages since the amended ordinance went into effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ordinance itself makes no distinctions based on the messages displayed on the signs.   Such differential protection is conferred instead by a state statute, the Massachusetts Zoning Act, Mass.  Gen. L. ch.   40A, &#167; 6, which mandates grandfather protection for all nonconforming uses--including signs--that are in existence at the time a zoning ordinance is enacted or amended.   The statute excludes from such protection, however, billboards, signs and other advertising devices subject to the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Outdoor Advertising Board (OAB).   The OAB regulates so-called \"off-premise\" signs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The combined effect of the local ordinance and state law, therefore, is to protect signs that do not conform to the amended Cambridge ordinance only if they carry onsite messages.   None of Ackerley's billboards are grandfathered under this scheme because all of its messages are offsite ones--i.e., they are unrelated to the property on which they sit.   Thus, Ackerley's 46 noncommercial, off-premises messages must be taken down while a large number of nonconforming commercial signs are protected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cambridge officials recognized the limited nature of the grandfather provision, and, indeed, endorsed its preference for onsite signs, finding:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>Nonconforming off-premise signs, which traditionally have been used primarily to advertise commercial goods and services not available on the same premises, have a significantly greater adverse aesthetic impact than on premises signs because of their larger sizes, greater heights, less attractive appearances, and/or more intrusive locations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zoning Ordinance Article 7.000, &#167; 7.11.1(F).   The Findings section of the ordinance further states that \"[t]he public interest is served by use of signs by businesses and services to identify their premises, or the products or services there available, or to display noncommercial messages.\"   Id. at (G).   The importance of noncommercial messages is reflected in a \"substitution provision\" in the ordinance, which provides that \"[a]ny sign permitted under this Article may contain, in lieu of or in addition to any other copy, any noncommercial message.\"   Article 7.000, &#167; 7.17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consistent with this scheme, when the ordinance's four-year grace period expired in 1995, Cambridge informed Ackerley that its signs would have to come down.   Ackerley sought a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of the ordinance, arguing that it violates the First Amendment because it favors nonconforming signs that carry commercial messages over similar signs that carry noncommercial messages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The district court denied injunctive relief.   It found that Ackerley had not demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits because the ordinance \"in effect[ ] distinguishes between on-site and off-site signs, which is permissible, and not between commercial and non-commercial messages.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley consequently filed this appeal, arguing that the district court misapplied relevant First Amendment law.

We accept the invitation to make the ultimate determination, and proceed with our analysis from that perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <p>A. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The City of Cambridge has been working for a number of years to improve its aesthetic environment through the increasingly restrictive regulation of signs.   The 1991 revisions to its sign ordinance for the first time required removal of certain non-conforming signs.   Although the ordinance affects many more signs than just the large, visually demanding--some would say offensive--ones that most of us would identify as billboards, a comprehensive report prepared in connection with the revised ordinance reveals that they are the city's most pressing concern.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Billboards typically carry offsite messages.   The state's grandfathering provision--exempting nonconforming on-premise signs--therefore nicely dovetails with Cambridge's priority to eliminate billboards as soon as possible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Onsite signs, most of which are business signs, may stay;  offsite signs--many of which at the moment in Cambridge are billboards carrying noncommercial messages--must go.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley offers two primary reasons why this scheme violates the First Amendment.   First, it claims that the Cambridge ordinance directly conflicts with our decision in City of Somerville, where we found the ordinance to be impermissible based on a grandfathering provision that exempted only signs that had carried no offsite commercial speech during the year preceding the ordinance's enactment.   We held that \"[i]t is without question that the government may not impose a penalty--in this case, denying the right to continue speaking by means of nonconforming signs--because of a person's constitutionally protected past speech.\"  878 F.2d at 519.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley contends that Cambridge's ordinance, when applied in light of the state statute, suffers from essentially the same flaw:  the right to use nonconforming signs in the future to express noncommercial messages is given by the substitution provision only to certain speakers, based on their past speech--in this instance, to those who were displaying onsite messages on the day the ordinance was enacted.   Ackerley maintains that distributing the future right to speak in a certain way (i.e., through large, nonconforming signs) based on the content of earlier speech is impermissible whether the restriction looks back a year in time, as it did in Somerville, or only a day.   This must be so, it asserts, because the practical effect of the two ordinances is identical;  both reserve the right to display noncommercial messages primarily to a limited category of speakers, business owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ackerley's second theory is that the ordinance is invalid because it imposes an impermissible content-based restriction on speech:  whether a sign may remain is determined by the message it carries.   Because most content-based restrictions are presumptively invalid, see City of Ladue v. Gilleo, --- U.S. ----, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117847\"><a href=\"/opinion/117847/city-of-ladue-v-gilleo/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The ordinance, however, gives protection based on the message and not the physical characteristics, and it is that distinction that the city must justify.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Perhaps if a total ban of signs were at issue, signs identifying buildings would be a permissible limited exception because, like traffic and safety signs, they would serve a substantial need that could not be met in any other way.   In this case, however, we consider not a total ban, but only restrictions on size, style and location.   The identification interest for nonconforming signs cannot satisfy even intermediate scrutiny when the ordinance presumes that identification can be accomplished adequately in the future by smaller signs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>C. The City of Somerville Problem:  Penalizing Past Speech</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulation's second flaw arises from the manner in which it seeks to protect ideological speech.   The substitution provision guarantees that noncommercial messages may be placed on any exempted sign.   What this means, however, is that Cambridge is choosing which speakers may in the future display offsite noncommercial messages on nonconforming signs in the way City of Somerville held was impermissible--by looking to past speech.   Only those speakers whose signs displayed onsite messages on the day of the ordinance's enactment may substitute noncommercial messages for the previous ones.   We explored at some length in City of Somerville the dangers of awarding future speech rights based on past speech.   See 878 F.2d at 519-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although those dangers may seem less likely from the Cambridge regulation because it does not, like Somerville's, disqualify speakers based on only a single day's display of a non-preferred message (i.e., offsite commercial) during the course of a year, the Cambridge scheme's reliance on the date of enactment nevertheless eliminates speakers from future access to a particular medium based on their past choice of lawful speech.   If it is impermissible to assign future speech rights based on the content of past speech, the amount of past speech does not strike us as significant.   The chilling effect that results from linking future speech to past speech exists even if the pressure to conform one's speech is compressed into a short time frame.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the division drawn here between those who may and may not use nonconforming signs in the future, for the most part, isolates business and property owners as a privileged class.   As Cambridge freely acknowledges, onsite signs typically are commercial in nature.   Because the substitution provision gives the right to display noncommercial messages on nonconforming signs only to those individuals whose signs previously carried onsite messages, the primary effect of the substitution provision is to give only commercial speakers the option of changing their signs to noncommercial messages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giving an identifiable group virtually exclusive access to the use of a medium is wholly inconsistent with First Amendment principles;  it is doubtful that the noncommercial messages of interest to business owners would reflect as broad a cross-section of viewpoints as might occur in a marketplace in which every speaker has equal footing to speak.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  Indeed, the case law makes it clear that even more problematic than the loss of all noncommercial messages would be the selective preservation of them.

In addition, most offsite signs tend to display commercial messages;  Ackerley's present configuration in Cambridge is a deliberate departure from its usual mixture of messages (15% noncommercial) in order to place itself in the best possible position to retain use of its sign faces.   Limiting grandfather protection to onsite signs thus is an effective means of accomplishing the city's legitimate objective of improving aesthetics, and typically would result in the loss primarily of offsite commercial messages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact remains, however, that the grandfathering benefit is conferred in content-based terms that have no aesthetic justification and effectively penalizes a category of speakers based on their prior choice of message.   In addition, nearly all of the sign owners privileged to display offsite noncommercial messages on nonconforming signs may be expected to share similar views on certain matters of public interest.   We hold that the First Amendment does not allow Cambridge to achieve its aesthetic objective by allocating the right to speak in this way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Remedial Option</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that our conclusion puts Cambridge in a peculiar position because the content-based grandfathering derives from state law.   Relief from this disability condition is beyond the scope of this court's power in this case.   Any change in state law probably must be left to the workings of the political process.   As we noted in Somerville, it is possible to construct a justifiable, content-neutral grandfather provision that will advance the city's \"dual objectives of eliminating most billboards while giving substantial protection to onsite signs,\" 878 F.2d at 522.   A grandfather provision could, for example, exclude from grandfathering all signs over a certain square footage on the ground that the larger the sign, the greater the aesthetic harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Indeed, Cambridge's own ordinance includes such a provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cambridge ordinance contains a severability provision stating that, in the event some portion of it is declared invalid, it is the City's intent that the remainder of the ordinance continue in full force and effect.   We do not in this decision rule unlawful any particular section of the ordinance.   Rather, because the constitutional problem stems from the interplay of the ordinance and the state provision, we hold only that Cambridge may not require removal of signs displaying noncommercial messages based on their exclusion from exemption under the state provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We repeat our explanation of the onsite/offsite distinction from City of Somerville, 878 F.2d at 513 n. 1:</p>\n        <p>An onsite sign carries a message that bears some relationship to the activities conducted on the premises where the sign is located.   For example, an onsite sign may simply identify a business or agency (\"Joe's Hardware\" or \"YMCA\"), or it may advertise a product or service available at that location (\"Budweiser Beer\" at Parise's Cafe or child care at the Lutheran Church).   Depending upon the business or agency, the message on the sign may be deemed either commercial or noncommercial.   An offsite sign--the category into which most billboards fit--carries a message unrelated to its particular location.   These signs also may display either commercial or noncommercial messages.   For example, an offsite sign may advertise \"Great Gifts at Kappy's Liquors,\" with Kappy's Liquors being located at some distance from the sign, or it may say \"No one should be left out in the cold.   Write:  Citizens Energy Corp.\"</p>\n        <p>Thus, the onsite/offsite distinction is not a distinction between signs attached to buildings and free standing signs.   An offsite sign may be located on a building rooftop, but because the product, good, or service it advertises is not available at the sign's location, it is classified as offsite.   For example, if a sign advertising the products available at Joe's Hardware is located atop the Parise Cafe building, Joe's sign is offsite.</p>\n        <p>In this opinion, we use the terms on-premise and off-premise interchangeably with onsite and offsite.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Article 7.000 of the Zoning Ordinances of the City of Cambridge provides, inter alia, that four categories of nonconforming signs must be removed within four years from the statute's enactment, or from the first date that the sign became nonconforming.   The signs required to be removed are those on rooftops, freestanding signs exceeding 30 square feet, wall signs exceeding 60 square feet and projecting signs exceeding 10 square feet. &#167; 7.18.1.  All of Ackerley's signs fall into at least one of these categories</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Ackerley accurately points out that the descriptive terms \"off-premise\" and \"on-premise\" can be misleading when used to modify the word \"sign\", since the applicable category is determined not by a sign's location, but by its message.

The report found that on-premise signs, in contrast, have a more \"limited and contained\" aesthetic impact because \"they are placed low on their host buildings, they are obscured from afar by street trees and almost without exception they do not approach the sheer size and dominance of off-premise signs.\"   In addition, the report stated that onsite signs were likely to be less permanent, since businesses are likely to change hands and new signs would not be grandfathered</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> For purposes of our discussion, we treat the state grandfathering provision as part-and-parcel of the Cambridge ordinance, and certain of our references to \"the Cambridge ordinance\" will assume that the grandfathering provision is contained within it.   Indeed, as noted supra, at pages 34-35, the ordinance seems to incorporate the state grandfather provision as part of its regulatory scheme</p>\n        <p>We emphasize that the validity of the state statute, as an independent matter, is not a question before us.   The issue we must decide is whether Cambridge may enforce its sign ordinance to require Ackerley to remove its billboards.   As Cambridge's counsel acknowledged at oral argument, the impact of the state grandfathering provision is relevant to that inquiry regardless of the statute's constitutionality.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In \"commonsense\" terms, the distinction surely is content-based because determining whether a sign may stay up or must come down requires consideration of the message it carries.

As in Somerville, a speaker's willingness to display noncommercial messages in the future is insufficient to qualify that speaker's signs for exemption;  eligibility for future use is based on past speech</p>\n        <p>Indeed, the substitution provision appears to lead to a potentially bizarre operation of the sign ordinance.   It seems that Ackerley could have protected its billboards by changing them to onsite commercial messages before the ordinance went into effect.   Although the onsite messages available for some of the signs likely would be limited, creative possibilities--such as \"No Trespassing\" or \"This Property Not for Sale\"--seem to exist.   The substitution provision apparently would have allowed Ackerley to revert to noncommercial messages the next day.   Such a scheme strikes us as irrational.   In addition, First Amendment values are inverted:  Ackerley's signs would be protected if they contained (onsite) commercial messages but not if they contained (offsite) noncommercial ones.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn16\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16_ref\">16</a>\n        <p> \"Such an ordinance would fall directly within the time, place, or manner category of speech regulations, and would need to meet the three-part test established for content-neutral regulations.
