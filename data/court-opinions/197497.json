Plaintiff-appellant Manuel T.\r\r\n\nHidalgo appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\n\nin favor of defendant-appellee Overseas Condado Insurance\r\n\nAgencies, Inc. on Hidalgo's claim for damages and equitable\r\n\nrelief pursuant to the Age Discrimination and Employment Act,\r\n\n29 U.S.C. SS 621-634. Finding that plaintiff-appellant failed\r\n\nto present evidence sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion\r\n\nconcerning unlawful age animus, we affirm.\r\n\n                         Background\r\n\n          On January 15, 1963, Hidalgo and two partners formed\r\n\nthe Condado Insurance Agency, Inc. (\"Condado\"). Hidalgo\r\n\nsubsequently became the sole shareholder. In September 1982,\r\n\nHidalgo sold Condado to Royal Insurance Ltd. (\"Royal\"). After\r\n\nthe sale, Royal retained Hidalgo as president of Condado. Some\r\n\ntime later, Royal acquired Overseas Insurance Agencies, Inc.,\r\n\nand, in 1988, merged this agency with Condado to form the\r\n\nOverseas Condado Insurance Agencies, Inc. (\"Overseas\"). In the\r\n\nprocess of the merger, Royal created the Condado Division of\r\n\nOverseas and named Hidalgo president of the Division. The\r\n\nCondado Division consisted of Hidalgo, Sagrario Maiz del Toro\r\n\n(Hidalgo's secretary) and Doris Rodriguez (Hidalgo's\r\n\nassistant). Dating from the sale of Condado to Royal,\r\n\nHidalgo's functions included promoting and servicing all of\r\n\nCondado's existing accounts and acquiring new accounts. \r\n\n          On September 1, 1993, Hidalgo's sixty-fifth birthday,\r\n\nHidalgo was to become eligible to retire and receive normal\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nbenefits under Overseas' retirement plan. Approximately five\r\n\nmonths before this date, on March 29, 1993, Victor Rios,\r\n\nPresident of Royal and Chairman of Overseas, sent Hidalgo a\r\n\nletter informing him that Overseas recognized that he would\r\n\nbecome eligible for normal retirement benefits on September 1,\r\n\n1993, and that Overseas expected him to retire on that date\r\n\n\"[i]n accordance with the company's established guidelines.\" \r\n\n          After receiving this letter, Hidalgo informed Rios\r\n\nthat he did not intend to retire on September 1. On July 2,\r\n\n1993, Rios sent Hidalgo another communication informing him\r\n\nthat the Condado Division would cease to exist on September 1\r\n\nbecause Overseas planned to integrate it into its \"regular\r\n\noperation.\" In this same communication, Rios instructed\r\n\nHidalgo that Overseas would wait until September 1 to allow him\r\n\nto \"fully qualify for . . . [his] pension plan,\" but that it\r\n\ndid not intend to extend his employment contract after that\r\n\ndate. On August 18, Hidalgo again informed Rios of his desire\r\n\nto remain as president of the Condado Division. Rios replied\r\n\nby offering Hidalgo an arrangement whereby he could function as\r\n\nan \"independent producer\" with his compensation based on\r\n\ncommissions and bonuses. Hidalgo refused this offer. \r\n\n          Subsequently, Hidalgo filed complaints with the Equal\r\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the Department\r\n\nof Labor and Human Resources of Puerto Rico. On December 30,\r\n\n1993, the Department of Labor issued Hidalgo a Notice of Right\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nto Sue. On March 10, 1994, Hidalgo filed in federal district\r\n\ncourt the complaint which underlies this appeal. He alleged\r\n\nthat Overseas dismissed him from his job because of his age and\r\n\nrequested damages and equitable relief pursuant to the Age\r\n\nDiscrimination and Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. SS 621-\r\n\n634. Hidalgo also invoked the district court's supplemental\r\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1367 for his state law\r\n\nclaims seeking compensation for age-based discrimination, 29\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, S 146 (1985). \r\n\n          On June 24, 1994, Overseas filed a Motion to Dismiss\r\n\nor for Summary Judgment. On June 20, 1996, the district court\r\n\n(Casellas, J.), treating the motion as a motion for summary\r\n\njudgment, determined that Hidalgo failed to establish one of\r\n\nthe elements necessary to state a prima facie case of\r\n\nemployment discrimination under the ADEA. Notwithstanding this\r\n\ndetermination, the court further ruled that Hidalgo failed\r\n\neither to prove that Overseas' articulated legitimate reasons\r\n\nfor his dismissal were a \"mere pretext\" or to provide evidence\r\n\nof discriminatory animus on Overseas' behalf. The court also\r\n\nrefused to exercise pendent jurisdiction over Hidalgo's state\r\n\nlaw claims. Consequently, the court disposed of Hidalgo's\r\n\ncomplaint in its entirety. This appeal ensued.\r\n\n                     Standard of Review\r\n\n1.  We note that Hidalgo did not appeal the dismissal of the\r\nstate law claims he stated in his complaint.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n          \"[O]ur review of a grant of summary judgment is  de\r\n\nnovo, [and] we, like the district court, are obliged to review\r\n\nthe record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\r\n\nand to draw all reasonable inferences in the nonmoving party's\r\n\nfavor.\"  LeBlanc v.

The district court's award of\r\n\nsummary judgment is appropriate when \"the pleadings,\r\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\r\n\nfile, together with affidavits, if any, show that there is no\r\n\ngenuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party\r\n\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

He first\r\n\nargues that the district court erred in determining that he\r\n\nfailed to establish a prima facie case of age discrimination\r\n\nunder the ADEA. He then contends that the district court\r\n\nimproperly concluded that he did not prove that Overseas'\r\n\nreasons for dismissing him were pretextual and that Overseas'\r\n\nactions derived from discriminatory animus. We address these\r\n\ncontentions in turn.\r\n\n          In an ADEA discrimination action, the plaintiff bears\r\n\nthe ultimate \"'burden of proving that his years were the\r\n\ndeterminative factor in his discharge, that is, that he would\r\n\nnot have been fired but for his age.'\"    Mesnick v.  General\r\n\nElec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Freeman\r\n\nv. Package \r                       Mach. \r                             Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1335 (1st Cir. 1988)).\r\n\n\"[W]hen there is little overt evidence of age discrimination,\r\n\nthe case usually follows the ritualized burden-shifting\r\n\nparadigm\" set forth in McDonnell \r                                             Douglas \r                                                     Corp. v. Green, 411\r\n\nU.S. 792, 802-05 (1973). LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 842. Pursuant to\r\n\nMcDonnell  \r                      Douglas, a plaintiff must present a prima facie\r\n\n2.  Interspersed with these two arguments, in addition to being\r\ndesignated in a separate section of his brief, is Hidalgo's\r\nargument that the district court committed reversible error\r\nbecause it viewed the facts in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party, namely Overseas. Instead of analyzing this\r\nassertion independently, we address it in the context of our\r\nanalysis of Hidalgo's two primary contentions concerning the\r\ndistrict court's disposition of his ADEA claim. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n\"showing of certain standardized elements suggestive of\r\n\npossible discrimination.\"  Id. \r\n\n          In this circuit, McDonnell Douglas' burden shifting\r\n\nparadigm assumes a slightly different form in age\r\n\ndiscrimination cases depending on whether or not the dismissal\r\n\nrepresented part of a reduction in force. If the plaintiff was\r\n\nnot dismissed as part of a reduction in force, the plaintiff\r\n\nestablishes a prima facie case by demonstrating the following:\r\n\n\"(1) [he] was at least forty years of age, (2) [he] met the\r\n\nemployer's legitimate job performance expectations, (3) [he]\r\n\nexperienced adverse employment action, and (4) [he] was\r\n\nreplaced by a person with roughly equivalent job\r\n\nqualifications.\"  Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1117. With respect to\r\n\nthe fourth element necessary to establish a prima facie case in\r\n\na nonreduction in force scenario, \"[i]t is enough for [the]\r\n\nplaintiff to show that the employer sought some form of\r\n\nreplacement performance, which would demonstrate its 'continued\r\n\nneed for the same services and skills.'\" \r                                                    Kale v. \r                                                            Combined Ins.\r\n\nCo. of Am.\r                     , 861 F.2d 746, 760 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting \r                                                                  Loeb v.\r\n\nTextron,  \r                     Inc., 600 F.2d 1003, 1013 (1st Cir. 1979));      see\r\n\nKeisling v. \r                       SER-Jobs for Progress, Inc.\r                                                  , 19 F.3d 755, 760 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1994); \r                       Vega v. \r                               Kodak Caribbean, Ltd.\r                                                   , 3 F.3d 476, 479 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1993). \"A replacement need not be sought from outside the\r\n\ncompany, of course, nor need he be designated formally as\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nsuch.\"  Loeb, 600 F.2d at 1013 n.11; see Keisling, 19 F.3d at\r\n\n760. \r\n\n          If the employer dismissed the plaintiff as part of a\r\n\nreduction in force, the plaintiff \"need not show replacement by\r\n\nsomeone with equivalent job qualifications.

In his appellate brief, Hidalgo, for the first time,\r\ninsists that even if his dismissal occurred as part of a\r\nreduction in force scenario, Overseas did not treat age\r\nneutrally. \"It is well established that this court will not\r\nconsider an argument presented for the first time on appeal.\"\r\nVillafane-Neriz v. \r                              F.D.I.C., 75 F.3d 727, 734 (1st Cir. 1996);\r\nsee Poliquin v.

Hidalgo also\r\n\nsubmitted evidence that subsequent to his termination Overseas\r\n\ninformed certain of his former accounts of its desire to\r\n\n\"continue servicing\" them \"as heretofore.\" It seems plausible,\r\n\nviewing Hidalgo's evidence concerning the servicing of his\r\n\naccounts by other Overseas employees after September 1, 1993\r\n\nand Overseas' communications to at least one of his former\r\n\naccounts in the light most favorable to him,  see LeBlanc, 6\r\n\nF.3d at 841, that Overseas had a \"'continued need for the same\r\n\nservices and skills'\" that Hidalgo offered before his\r\n\ntermination, Kale, 861 F.2d at 760 (quoting Loeb, 600 F.2d at\r\n\n1013); see also Keisling, 19 F.3d at 760 (quoting  Loeb, 600\r\n\nF.2d at 1013).

In his Unsworn Declaration Under Penalty of Perjury, Rios\r\nstated that \"[n]obody performs the services that [Hidalgo] . .\r\n. was performing or assumed his job responsibilities, as there\r\nis no continued need for an individual of Mr. Hidalgo's skills\r\nor who could provide the services he provided.\" This assertion\r\ndoes not jibe with Rios' subsequent admission that certain\r\naccounts for which Hidalgo had responsibility prior to his\r\ntermination \"were assigned to other Overseas[] employees who\r\nhandle[d] them in addition to the work they performed before\r\nthe Condado [D]ivision was eliminated.\" Moreover, Hidalgo\r\npresented testimony from employees of his former accounts\r\nindicating that subsequent to his termination, Overseas\r\nemployees contacted them concerning these accounts. The fact\r\nthat certain of Hidalgo's former accounts were \"handled\" by\r\nseveral other Overseas employees subsequent to his termination\r\nwould seem to satisfy the \r                                    McDonnell Douglas\r                                                     ' fourth requirement\r\nfor establishing a prima facie ADEA claim, at least as\r\ninterpreted in Loeb, Kale, and  Keisling.

In his Unsworn Declaration Upon\r\n\nPenalty of Perjury, Hidalgo indicated that between 1984 and\r\n\n1986, the net underwriting profit for the Condado Division\r\n\nclimbed from $249,803.00 to $422,826.00. Hidalgo did not\r\n\npresent figures for the period after 1988, when the Overseas\r\n\nand Condado operations merged, because, according to Hidalgo,\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\nOverseas failed to make these figures available upon his\r\n\nrequest. Yet, he did state in his Unsworn Declaration that\r\n\nOverseas underestimated the profitability of the Condado\r\n\nDivision since 1990. Hidalgo contends that Overseas' failure\r\n\nto provide the figures concerning the profitability of the\r\n\nCondado Division, combined with his testimony concerning\r\n\nadditional profits stemming from the Division, suffices to\r\n\ndemonstrate pretext on Overseas' part. \r\n\n          Hidalgo also submitted two communications from his\r\n\nsupervisor, Ramon Lozada, dated April 10, 1991 and January 16,\r\n\n1993, as proof of Overseas' enthusiasm for Hidalgo's work as\r\n\npresident of the Condado Division and its belief that his\r\n\nprospects with Overseas were excellent. In addition, Hidalgo\r\n\ndeclared in his Unsworn Declaration that as a member of the\r\n\nOverseas Board of Directors, he was present at a March 25, 1993\r\n\nmeeting during which the alleged unprofitability of the Condado\r\n\nDivision was never discussed. Hidalgo also stated in his\r\n\nUnsworn Declaration that it was not until he informed Overseas\r\n\nthat he did not intend to retire on September 1 that Overseas\r\n\ninformed him that his termination constituted part of a plan to\r\n\neliminate the Condado Division effective September 1. \r\n\n          Hidalgo offered evidence that immediately after his\r\n\ndismissal and the elimination of the Condado Division,\r\n\nRodriguez on several occasions performed some of the tasks that\r\n\nshe previously had performed as his assistant. According to\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                         17\r\r\n\nHidalgo, this activity, considered in conjunction with the fact\r\n\nthat certain accounts for which he previously was responsible\r\n\nremained with Overseas and were attended to by other Overseas\r\n\nemployees after his dismissal, demonstrated that the Condado\r\n\nDivision \"continued to function as before, albeit under a\r\n\ndifferent name.\" Hidalgo insists that this evidence\r\n\n\"combine[d] to prove that defendant's alleged reason, a\r\n\ndecision to close the Condado Division, was a sham, masking\r\n\ndefendant's illegal age discrimination.\" \r\n\n          Hidalgo finally maintains that Overseas never\r\n\ninformed him of the alleged complaints of brokers and agents\r\n\nconcerning his interference with their business. Instead,\r\n\nHidalgo offered an evaluation of his work that Lozada prepared\r\n\non January 16, 1993 (slightly more than two months before Rios\r\n\ninformed him that Overseas expected him to retire effective\r\n\nSeptember 1) in which he received the best possible ratings in\r\n\nall categories, including the category labeled: \"How\r\n\nsuccessful is he in getting along with people in his day-to-day\r\n\nwork relationships?\" In fact, the evaluation indicated that he\r\n\n\"stands out as being among the best . . . known\" and that he\r\n\n\"will qualify for advancement beyond the next higher job\r\n\nclassification or level of responsibility.\" Hidalgo insists\r\n\nthat this evidence \"raises a genuine issue of fact as to\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\nwhether age discrimination motivated the retirement or the\r\n\ndismissal decision of defendant.\"\r\n\n          We doubt that the evidence that Hidalgo submitted,\r\n\ntaken in the light most favorable to his claim, \r                                                           see \r                                                               LeBlanc, 6\r\n\nF.3d at 841, demonstrates that Overseas' asserted reasons for\r\n\ndismissing him were pretextual, see Lehman v. Prudential Ins.\r\n\nCo.  \r                of  \r                    Am., 74 F.3d 323, 330 (1st Cir. 1996). We note,\r\n\nhowever, that Hidalgo cites  Mulero-Rodriguez to support his\r\n\npretext argument.  In    Mulero-Rodriguez, the plaintiff, a\r\n\ndirector of the defendant corporation, stated in his deposition\r\n\ntestimony that the defendant never informed him of its\r\n\ndissatisfaction with his ability to assure an inventory level\r\n\n8.  Overseas argues that much of the evidence Hidalgo submits\r\nto demonstrate pretext and age-based animus fails to comply\r\nwith the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) and thus should\r\nnot be considered on appeal. Overseas also contends that much\r\nof this evidence was untimely presented to the district court.\r\nGiven the ultimate disposition of this appeal, we deem it\r\nunnecessary to address these arguments. We assume for the sake\r\nof argument, without concluding, that the evidence Hidalgo\r\nsubmitted satisfies the minimum requirements of Rule 56(e).\r\n\n9.  In addition to Mulero-Rodriguez, Hidalgo cites Hebert and\r\nWoodman v. \r                      Haemonetics Corp.\r                                       , 51 F.3d 1087 (1st Cir. 1995), to\r\nsupport his contention that the evidence he submitted sufficed\r\nto demonstrate a material issue of fact concerning pretext. In\r\nthese cases, however, the evidence that the plaintiffs\r\nsubmitted to demonstrate pretext was far more extensive and far\r\nmore persuasive than the evidence Hidalgo presents in this\r\ninstance.  See Woodman, 51 F.3d at 1093 (discussing not only\r\nperformance evaluations but also defendant's admission of\r\ndisfavoring older employers as creating a reasonable inference\r\nof pretext for intentional age discrimination);  Hebert, 872\r\nF.2d at 1115 (listing employer's failure to inform plaintiff of\r\nadverse feedback on his work as only one of many pieces of\r\ncircumstantial evidence that the plaintiff submitted in\r\naddition to statistical evidence). \r\n\n                            -19-\r                                         19\r\r\n\nnecessary for the smooth operation of the business.   See 98\r\n\nF.3d at 675. The plaintiff also indicated that the defendant\r\n\nfailed to produce \"business records in any way reflecting a\r\n\nshortage [of inventory] or lost sales or income based thereon.\"\r\n\nId. Considering only this evidence, the \r                                                   Mulero-Rodriguez court\r\n\ndetermined, \"giving credence to [the plaintiff's] . . .\r\n\ntestimony,\" that the issue of pretext \"should be left to the\r\n\nfactfinders.\"  Id.\r\n\n          Much like the plaintiff in \r                                                Mulero-Rodriguez, Hidalgo\r\n\ntestified in his Unsworn Declaration both that Overseas never\r\n\ninformed him of the alleged complaints against him and that\r\n\nOverseas failed to produce any business records supporting its\r\n\nallegation of the Condado Division's unprofitability. While we\r\n\ndoubt that these similarities suffice to demonstrate pretext on\r\n\nOverseas' part, we recognize that this is a close call and,\r\n\ntherefore, we assume, without deciding, that Hidalgo\r\n\nestablished pretext. See \r                                     Udo, 54 F.3d at 13 (assuming \r                                                                 arguendo\r\n\nthat employer's action was pretextual). We thus \"turn directly\r\n\nto the question of whether [Hidalgo] . . . can show that the\r\n\nreal reason [for his dismissal] was age discrimination.\"  Id.\r\n\nat 676.\r\n\n          In this case, \"even if [Hidalgo] . . . fashioned a\r\n\ntriable issue as to pretext, there was . . . no 'significantly\r\n\nprobative' evidence to show that the pretext masked age\r\n\ndiscrimination.\" Medina-Munoz, 896 F.2d at 9 (quoting \r                                                                 Anderson\r\n\n                            -20-\r                                         20\r\r\n\nv. \r              Liberty Lobby, Inc.\r                                 , 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986)). Hidalgo\r\n\noffered no evidence that reasonably could be construed to\r\n\nindicate that Overseas intended to discriminate against him\r\n\nbecause of his age. None of Hidalgo's evidence concerning\r\n\neither the profitability of the Condado Division or Overseas'\r\n\nfailure to inform him of the alleged complaints against him by\r\n\nbrokers and agents points to any     age  \r                                                      related  \r                                                               animus on\r\n\nOverseas' behalf. Similarly, the evidence concerning the\r\n\nongoing servicing of Hidalgo's former accounts by Overseas\r\n\nemployees, including Rodriguez's work on these accounts, and\r\n\nOverseas' apparent satisfaction with his performance, though\r\n\nperhaps indicative of pretext on Overseas' part, does not\r\n\nevidence any \r                        age-based discriminatory intent\r                                                       .

Normal Retirement Date,\r\n\n[he could] . . . do so.\" \r\n\n          This evidence does not \"raise a genuine issue of fact\r\n\nas to whether discrimination motivated the adverse employment\r\n\naction.\"  Olivera v.

The Royal\r\n\nRetirement Plan indicates that the normal retirement date for\r\n\nOverseas employees falls at or near their sixty-fifth birthday.\r\n\nOverseas' March 29 letter to Hidalgo indicated its expectation\r\n\nthat Hidalgo would retire on or near his Normal Retirement\r\n\nDate.

In our view, the fact that Overseas expected Hidalgo to\r\n\nretire when he became eligible for his normal retirement\r\n\nbenefits would not permit a jury determination that Overseas\r\n\nwas motivated by age animus when it decided to dismiss Hidalgo.\r\n\nSee Udo, 54 F.3d at 14 (finding letter employer sent to\r\n\nemployee informing him that employer expected him to retire\r\n\nwhen he turned sixty-five did not evidence age animus on\r\n\nemployer's behalf). \r\n\n          When considered in the context of the record evidence\r\n\nas a whole,  see  Connell, 924 F.2d at 1172 n.3;    see  also\r\n\nGoldman, 985 F.2d at 1119 (\"[T]he totality of the circumstances\r\n\nmust permit a reasonable inference that the employer's\r\n\njustification for the challenged action was pretext for age\r\n\ndiscrimination.\"), viewed in the light most favorable to\r\n\nHidalgo, see LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 841, the March 29 letter and\r\n\nthe Royal Retirement Plan still would not suffice to allow a\r\n\njury reasonably to find that Overseas exhibited age-based\r\n\nanimus in this case. Overseas sent Hidalgo the letter\r\n\n                            -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\nconcerning its expectation that he retire on his Normal\r\n\nRetirement Date more than five months prior to his sixty-fifth\r\n\nbirthday and repeatedly declared its intention to take no\r\n\naction that would interfere with his ability to qualify for\r\n\nnormal retirement benefits. On July 2, 1993, Overseas\r\n\nexplained to Hidalgo its independent business decision to\r\n\neliminate the Condado Division effective September 1, 1993,\r\n\nwhich accommodated the full vesting of his pension plan.\r\n\nDespite its decision to eliminate the Condado Division, on\r\n\nAugust 19, 1993, Overseas offered to employ Hidalgo as an\r\n\nindependent producer, with compensation based on commission and\r\n\nbonuses. Hidalgo rejected these offers, and, on September 1,\r\n\nOverseas implemented the plan it had enunciated to Hidalgo on\r\n\nJuly 2 to eliminate the Condado Division as a separate entity.\r\n\n          Contrary to Hidalgo's assertions, we believe the only\r\n\ninference that the evidence in the record supports, without\r\n\nimproper speculation on our part, is that Overseas simply timed\r\n\nits elimination of the Condado Division to dovetail with\r\n\nHidalgo's Normal Retirement Date. This would be entirely\r\n\nappropriate.  See Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1118 n.4 (\"[A] 'mere\r\n\nshowing that the employer's articulated reason may shield\r\n\nanother (possibly nondiscriminatory) reason does not create a\r\n\ndispute of material fact' sufficient to withstand summary\r\n\njudgment.\"); \r                        Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825; \r                                                 see \r                                                     also \r                                                          Udo, 54 F.3d at\r\n\n14 (finding letter expressing employer's expectation that\r\n\n                            -24-\r                                         24\r\r\n\nemployee would retire at age sixty-five insufficient evidence\r\n\nof discriminatory age animus to withstand summary judgment\r\n\nwhere employer subsequently articulated nondiscriminatory\r\n\nrationale for dismissing employee). \r\n\n          As we previously have noted, \"the material creating\r\n\nthe factual dispute must herald the existence of 'definite,\r\n\ncompetent evidence' fortifying the plaintiff's version of the\r\n\ntruth.

In this case, Hidalgo's\r\n\narguments \"are based largely upon . . . improbable inferences[]\r\n\nand unsupported speculation,\" \r                                         LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 849, and thus\r\n\nfall short. In light of the evidence in the record, viewed in\r\n\nthe light most favorable to Hidalgo, we do not believe that a\r\n\ntrier of fact could conclude that Overseas unlawfully\r\n\ndiscriminated against Hidalgo.

Plaintiff-appellant Manuel T.\r\r\n\nHidalgo appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\n\nin favor of defendant-appellee Overseas Condado Insurance\r\n\nAgencies, Inc. on Hidalgo's claim for damages and equitable\r\n\nrelief pursuant to the Age Discrimination and Employment Act,\r\n\n29 U.S.C. SS 621-634. Finding that plaintiff-appellant failed\r\n\nto present evidence sufficient to meet his burden of persuasion\r\n\nconcerning unlawful age animus, we affirm.\r\n\n                         Background\r\n\n          On January 15, 1963, Hidalgo and two partners formed\r\n\nthe Condado Insurance Agency, Inc. (\"Condado\"). Hidalgo\r\n\nsubsequently became the sole shareholder. In September 1982,\r\n\nHidalgo sold Condado to Royal Insurance Ltd. (\"Royal\"). After\r\n\nthe sale, Royal retained Hidalgo as president of Condado. Some\r\n\ntime later, Royal acquired Overseas Insurance Agencies, Inc.,\r\n\nand, in 1988, merged this agency with Condado to form the\r\n\nOverseas Condado Insurance Agencies, Inc. (\"Overseas\"). In the\r\n\nprocess of the merger, Royal created the Condado Division of\r\n\nOverseas and named Hidalgo president of the Division. The\r\n\nCondado Division consisted of Hidalgo, Sagrario Maiz del Toro\r\n\n(Hidalgo's secretary) and Doris Rodriguez (Hidalgo's\r\n\nassistant). Dating from the sale of Condado to Royal,\r\n\nHidalgo's functions included promoting and servicing all of\r\n\nCondado's existing accounts and acquiring new accounts. \r\n\n          On September 1, 1993, Hidalgo's sixty-fifth birthday,\r\n\nHidalgo was to become eligible to retire and receive normal\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nbenefits under Overseas' retirement plan. Approximately five\r\n\nmonths before this date, on March 29, 1993, Victor Rios,\r\n\nPresident of Royal and Chairman of Overseas, sent Hidalgo a\r\n\nletter informing him that Overseas recognized that he would\r\n\nbecome eligible for normal retirement benefits on September 1,\r\n\n1993, and that Overseas expected him to retire on that date\r\n\n\"[i]n accordance with the company's established guidelines.\" \r\n\n          After receiving this letter, Hidalgo informed Rios\r\n\nthat he did not intend to retire on September 1. On July 2,\r\n\n1993, Rios sent Hidalgo another communication informing him\r\n\nthat the Condado Division would cease to exist on September 1\r\n\nbecause Overseas planned to integrate it into its \"regular\r\n\noperation.\" In this same communication, Rios instructed\r\n\nHidalgo that Overseas would wait until September 1 to allow him\r\n\nto \"fully qualify for . . . [his] pension plan,\" but that it\r\n\ndid not intend to extend his employment contract after that\r\n\ndate. On August 18, Hidalgo again informed Rios of his desire\r\n\nto remain as president of the Condado Division. Rios replied\r\n\nby offering Hidalgo an arrangement whereby he could function as\r\n\nan \"independent producer\" with his compensation based on\r\n\ncommissions and bonuses. Hidalgo refused this offer. \r\n\n          Subsequently, Hidalgo filed complaints with the Equal\r\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the Department\r\n\nof Labor and Human Resources of Puerto Rico. On December 30,\r\n\n1993, the Department of Labor issued Hidalgo a Notice of Right\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nto Sue. On March 10, 1994, Hidalgo filed in federal district\r\n\ncourt the complaint which underlies this appeal. He alleged\r\n\nthat Overseas dismissed him from his job because of his age and\r\n\nrequested damages and equitable relief pursuant to the Age\r\n\nDiscrimination and Employment Act (\"ADEA\"), 29 U.S.C. SS 621-\r\n\n634. Hidalgo also invoked the district court's supplemental\r\n\njurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1367 for his state law\r\n\nclaims seeking compensation for age-based discrimination, 29\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, S 146 (1985). \r\n\n          On June 24, 1994, Overseas filed a Motion to Dismiss\r\n\nor for Summary Judgment. On June 20, 1996, the district court\r\n\n(Casellas, J.), treating the motion as a motion for summary\r\n\njudgment, determined that Hidalgo failed to establish one of\r\n\nthe elements necessary to state a prima facie case of\r\n\nemployment discrimination under the ADEA. Notwithstanding this\r\n\ndetermination, the court further ruled that Hidalgo failed\r\n\neither to prove that Overseas' articulated legitimate reasons\r\n\nfor his dismissal were a \"mere pretext\" or to provide evidence\r\n\nof discriminatory animus on Overseas' behalf.

While we find that Hidalgo failed\r\n\nto produce evidence sufficient to meet his ultimate burden of\r\n\npersuasion, \r                       see \r                           Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253, we present Hidalgo's\r\n\nevidence in detail in light of his contention that the district\r\n\ncourt failed to consider this evidence in the light most\r\n\nfavorable to his claim. In his Unsworn Declaration Upon\r\n\nPenalty of Perjury, Hidalgo indicated that between 1984 and\r\n\n1986, the net underwriting profit for the Condado Division\r\n\nclimbed from $249,803.00 to $422,826.00. Hidalgo did not\r\n\npresent figures for the period after 1988, when the Overseas\r\n\nand Condado operations merged, because, according to Hidalgo,\r\n\n                            -16-\r                                         16\r\r\n\nOverseas failed to make these figures available upon his\r\n\nrequest. Yet, he did state in his Unsworn Declaration that\r\n\nOverseas underestimated the profitability of the Condado\r\n\nDivision since 1990. Hidalgo contends that Overseas' failure\r\n\nto provide the figures concerning the profitability of the\r\n\nCondado Division, combined with his testimony concerning\r\n\nadditional profits stemming from the Division, suffices to\r\n\ndemonstrate pretext on Overseas' part. \r\n\n          Hidalgo also submitted two communications from his\r\n\nsupervisor, Ramon Lozada, dated April 10, 1991 and January 16,\r\n\n1993, as proof of Overseas' enthusiasm for Hidalgo's work as\r\n\npresident of the Condado Division and its belief that his\r\n\nprospects with Overseas were excellent. In addition, Hidalgo\r\n\ndeclared in his Unsworn Declaration that as a member of the\r\n\nOverseas Board of Directors, he was present at a March 25, 1993\r\n\nmeeting during which the alleged unprofitability of the Condado\r\n\nDivision was never discussed. Hidalgo also stated in his\r\n\nUnsworn Declaration that it was not until he informed Overseas\r\n\nthat he did not intend to retire on September 1 that Overseas\r\n\ninformed him that his termination constituted part of a plan to\r\n\neliminate the Condado Division effective September 1. \r\n\n          Hidalgo offered evidence that immediately after his\r\n\ndismissal and the elimination of the Condado Division,\r\n\nRodriguez on several occasions performed some of the tasks that\r\n\nshe previously had performed as his assistant. According to\r\n\n                            -17-\r                                         17\r\r\n\nHidalgo, this activity, considered in conjunction with the fact\r\n\nthat certain accounts for which he previously was responsible\r\n\nremained with Overseas and were attended to by other Overseas\r\n\nemployees after his dismissal, demonstrated that the Condado\r\n\nDivision \"continued to function as before, albeit under a\r\n\ndifferent name.\" Hidalgo insists that this evidence\r\n\n\"combine[d] to prove that defendant's alleged reason, a\r\n\ndecision to close the Condado Division, was a sham, masking\r\n\ndefendant's illegal age discrimination.\" \r\n\n          Hidalgo finally maintains that Overseas never\r\n\ninformed him of the alleged complaints of brokers and agents\r\n\nconcerning his interference with their business. Instead,\r\n\nHidalgo offered an evaluation of his work that Lozada prepared\r\n\non January 16, 1993 (slightly more than two months before Rios\r\n\ninformed him that Overseas expected him to retire effective\r\n\nSeptember 1) in which he received the best possible ratings in\r\n\nall categories, including the category labeled: \"How\r\n\nsuccessful is he in getting along with people in his day-to-day\r\n\nwork relationships?\" In fact, the evaluation indicated that he\r\n\n\"stands out as being among the best . . . known\" and that he\r\n\n\"will qualify for advancement beyond the next higher job\r\n\nclassification or level of responsibility.\" Hidalgo insists\r\n\nthat this evidence \"raises a genuine issue of fact as to\r\n\n                            -18-\r                                         18\r\r\n\nwhether age discrimination motivated the retirement or the\r\n\ndismissal decision of defendant.\"\r\n\n          We doubt that the evidence that Hidalgo submitted,\r\n\ntaken in the light most favorable to his claim, \r                                                           see \r                                                               LeBlanc, 6\r\n\nF.3d at 841, demonstrates that Overseas' asserted reasons for\r\n\ndismissing him were pretextual, see Lehman v.

We note,\r\n\nhowever, that Hidalgo cites  Mulero-Rodriguez to support his\r\n\npretext argument.  In    Mulero-Rodriguez, the plaintiff, a\r\n\ndirector of the defendant corporation, stated in his deposition\r\n\ntestimony that the defendant never informed him of its\r\n\ndissatisfaction with his ability to assure an inventory level\r\n\n8.  Overseas argues that much of the evidence Hidalgo submits\r\nto demonstrate pretext and age-based animus fails to comply\r\nwith the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e) and thus should\r\nnot be considered on appeal. Overseas also contends that much\r\nof this evidence was untimely presented to the district court.\r\nGiven the ultimate disposition of this appeal, we deem it\r\nunnecessary to address these arguments. We assume for the sake\r\nof argument, without concluding, that the evidence Hidalgo\r\nsubmitted satisfies the minimum requirements of Rule 56(e).\r\n\n9.  In addition to Mulero-Rodriguez, Hidalgo cites Hebert and\r\nWoodman v. \r                      Haemonetics Corp.\r                                       , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196019\"><a href=\"/opinion/196019/woodman-v-heamonetics-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1995), to\r\nsupport his contention that the evidence he submitted sufficed\r\nto demonstrate a material issue of fact concerning pretext.

The plaintiff also indicated that the defendant\r\n\nfailed to produce \"business records in any way reflecting a\r\n\nshortage [of inventory] or lost sales or income based thereon.\"\r\n\nId. Considering only this evidence, the \r                                                   Mulero-Rodriguez court\r\n\ndetermined, \"giving credence to [the plaintiff's] . . .\r\n\ntestimony,\" that the issue of pretext \"should be left to the\r\n\nfactfinders.\"  Id.\r\n\n          Much like the plaintiff in \r                                                Mulero-Rodriguez, Hidalgo\r\n\ntestified in his Unsworn Declaration both that Overseas never\r\n\ninformed him of the alleged complaints against him and that\r\n\nOverseas failed to produce any business records supporting its\r\n\nallegation of the Condado Division's unprofitability. While we\r\n\ndoubt that these similarities suffice to demonstrate pretext on\r\n\nOverseas' part, we recognize that this is a close call and,\r\n\ntherefore, we assume, without deciding, that Hidalgo\r\n\nestablished pretext. See \r                                     Udo, 54 F.3d at 13 (assuming \r                                                                 arguendo\r\n\nthat employer's action was pretextual).

Hidalgo\r\n\noffered no evidence that reasonably could be construed to\r\n\nindicate that Overseas intended to discriminate against him\r\n\nbecause of his age. None of Hidalgo's evidence concerning\r\n\neither the profitability of the Condado Division or Overseas'\r\n\nfailure to inform him of the alleged complaints against him by\r\n\nbrokers and agents points to any     age  \r                                                      related  \r                                                               animus on\r\n\nOverseas' behalf. Similarly, the evidence concerning the\r\n\nongoing servicing of Hidalgo's former accounts by Overseas\r\n\nemployees, including Rodriguez's work on these accounts, and\r\n\nOverseas' apparent satisfaction with his performance, though\r\n\nperhaps indicative of pretext on Overseas' part, does not\r\n\nevidence any \r                        age-based discriminatory intent\r                                                       .

The Royal\r\n\nRetirement Plan indicates that the normal retirement date for\r\n\nOverseas employees falls at or near their sixty-fifth birthday.\r\n\nOverseas' March 29 letter to Hidalgo indicated its expectation\r\n\nthat Hidalgo would retire on or near his Normal Retirement\r\n\nDate.

In our view, the fact that Overseas expected Hidalgo to\r\n\nretire when he became eligible for his normal retirement\r\n\nbenefits would not permit a jury determination that Overseas\r\n\nwas motivated by age animus when it decided to dismiss Hidalgo.\r\n\nSee Udo, 54 F.3d at 14 (finding letter employer sent to\r\n\nemployee informing him that employer expected him to retire\r\n\nwhen he turned sixty-five did not evidence age animus on\r\n\nemployer's behalf). \r\n\n          When considered in the context of the record evidence\r\n\nas a whole,  see  Connell, 924 F.2d at 1172 n.3;    see  also\r\n\nGoldman, 985 F.2d at 1119 (\"[T]he totality of the circumstances\r\n\nmust permit a reasonable inference that the employer's\r\n\njustification for the challenged action was pretext for age\r\n\ndiscrimination.\"), viewed in the light most favorable to\r\n\nHidalgo, see LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 841, the March 29 letter and\r\n\nthe Royal Retirement Plan still would not suffice to allow a\r\n\njury reasonably to find that Overseas exhibited age-based\r\n\nanimus in this case. Overseas sent Hidalgo the letter\r\n\n                            -23-\r                                         23\r\r\n\nconcerning its expectation that he retire on his Normal\r\n\nRetirement Date more than five months prior to his sixty-fifth\r\n\nbirthday and repeatedly declared its intention to take no\r\n\naction that would interfere with his ability to qualify for\r\n\nnormal retirement benefits. On July 2, 1993, Overseas\r\n\nexplained to Hidalgo its independent business decision to\r\n\neliminate the Condado Division effective September 1, 1993,\r\n\nwhich accommodated the full vesting of his pension plan.\r\n\nDespite its decision to eliminate the Condado Division, on\r\n\nAugust 19, 1993, Overseas offered to employ Hidalgo as an\r\n\nindependent producer, with compensation based on commission and\r\n\nbonuses. Hidalgo rejected these offers, and, on September 1,\r\n\nOverseas implemented the plan it had enunciated to Hidalgo on\r\n\nJuly 2 to eliminate the Condado Division as a separate entity.\r\n\n          Contrary to Hidalgo's assertions, we believe the only\r\n\ninference that the evidence in the record supports, without\r\n\nimproper speculation on our part, is that Overseas simply timed\r\n\nits elimination of the Condado Division to dovetail with\r\n\nHidalgo's Normal Retirement Date. This would be entirely\r\n\nappropriate.  See Goldman, 985 F.2d at 1118 n.4 (\"[A] 'mere\r\n\nshowing that the employer's articulated reason may shield\r\n\nanother (possibly nondiscriminatory) reason does not create a\r\n\ndispute of material fact' sufficient to withstand summary\r\n\njudgment.\"); \r                        Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825; \r                                                 see \r                                                     also \r                                                          Udo, 54 F.3d at\r\n\n14 (finding letter expressing employer's expectation that\r\n\n                            -24-\r                                         24\r\r\n\nemployee would retire at age sixty-five insufficient evidence\r\n\nof discriminatory age animus to withstand summary judgment\r\n\nwhere employer subsequently articulated nondiscriminatory\r\n\nrationale for dismissing employee). \r\n\n          As we previously have noted, \"the material creating\r\n\nthe factual dispute must herald the existence of 'definite,\r\n\ncompetent evidence' fortifying the plaintiff's version of the\r\n\ntruth.

In this case, Hidalgo's\r\n\narguments \"are based largely upon . . . improbable inferences[]\r\n\nand unsupported speculation,\" \r                                         LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 849, and thus\r\n\nfall short. In light of the evidence in the record, viewed in\r\n\nthe light most favorable to Hidalgo, we do not believe that a\r\n\ntrier of fact could conclude that Overseas unlawfully\r\n\ndiscriminated against Hidalgo.
