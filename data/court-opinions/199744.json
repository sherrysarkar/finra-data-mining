Becker, General Counsel, Jacob H. Stillman,\nSolicitor, Mark Pennington, Assistant General Counsel, Michael\nA. Conley, Attorney Fellow, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         December 21, 2001\n\f            Per Curiam. Appellant Sanjay Saxena appeals from\n\nthe   district     court's      grant    of   summary     judgment      to   the\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") in this civil law\n\nenforcement       action.       The     essential       facts    are   largely\n\nundisputed      and     the    parties      disagree     only    as    to    the\n\nconclusions that may be drawn from those facts.                        We have\n\ncarefully reviewed the record and briefs on appeal and\n\naffirm the judgment below.\n\n              First,      we    agree    with     the    district      court's\n\nconclusion    that      Saxena's      continued     performance        under   a\n\nconsulting agreement with Thorson, Zahler & Co. (\"Thorson\"),\n\na registered investment adviser and brokerage firm, for some\n\nnine months after entry of an administrative order barring\n\nhim from \"association with any broker, dealer, municipal\n\nsecurities      dealer,        investment       adviser     or    investment\n\ncompany,\" as well as his substantial involvement in the\n\nformation    of    two    investment        funds   and    Saxena      Capital\n\nManagement, Inc. (\"SCM\"), the company that served as general\n\npartner   for     the    funds,    was      sufficient     to    establish     a\n\nviolation of the bar order.\n\n            Further, Saxena does not dispute that he provided\n\nfree advertising for SCM and the investment funds on his\n\nwebsite and also provided SCM free access to his investment\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f newsletter subscriber lists for use in promoting the funds.\n\n And, since the solicitation of interests in the funds was\n\n undisputedly widespread and publicly advertised, interests\n\n in the funds were not, as Saxena contends, private offerings\n\n exempt from registration under Rule 506 of Regulation D, 17\n\n C.F.R. § 230.506.         See 15 U.S.C. § 77d(2); 17 C.F.R. §\n\n 230.502(c).     Accordingly, we think the undisputed facts\n\n demonstrate that Saxena violated the registration provisions\n\n of Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933\n\n (\"Securities    Act\"),     15    U.S.C.    §§     77e(a)    and   (c),   by\n\n participating       in   the    offer     or    sale   of     unregistered\n\n securities in interstate commerce or through the mails.1\n\n           The   undisputed        facts    also    showed     that   Saxena\n\n participated in preparing the offering memoranda for the\n\n investment funds and, in connection therewith, supplied\n\n false   and   misleading       information      concerning     the   funds'\n\n management    and    investment    strategies.         This    conduct   is\n\n sufficient to establish that Saxena violated the antifraud\n\n provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C.\n\n 77q(a), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n\n\n\n    1Interests in the investment funds constituted securities\nbecause the undisputed facts established that they were\n\"investment contracts\" as the Supreme Court defined that term in\nSEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 298-99 (1946).\n\n                                    -3-\n\f(\"Exchange Act\"), 15 U.S.C. 78j(b), Rule 10b-5 thereunder,\n\nand Sections 206(1) and 206(2) of the Investment Advisers\n\nAct of 1940 (\"Advisers Act\"), 15 U.S.C. §§ 80b-6(1) and (2).\n\nFurther,     Saxena's       failure   to    disclose   either   the   fee\n\narrangement under the Thorson consulting agreement or the\n\nSEC    bar   order     in      notices      advising   his   newsletter\n\nsubscribers of their opportunity to open brokerage accounts\n\nat Thorson, his failure to advise Thorson of the bar order,\n\nand his failure to            terminate the consulting agreement\n\nimmediately after its entry are also sufficient to establish\n\nviolations of Section 206(4) of the Advisers Act, 15 U.S.C.\n\n§ 80B-6(4) and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) thereunder.\n\n             We find no abuse of discretion in the district\n\ncourt's disgorgement order and award of a civil monetary\n\npenalty, see SEC v. Warde, 151 F.3d 42, 49 (2d Cir. 1998);\n\nSEC v. First City Financial Corp., 890 F.2d 1215, 1228 (D.C.\n\nCir.   1989),    and     Saxena's     remaining   challenges     to   the\n\ndistrict court's preclusion order and its denial of his\n\nmotion to transfer venue are meritless.\n\n             Affirmed.
