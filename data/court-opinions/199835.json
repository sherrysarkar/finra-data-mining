Twenty-three owners of real\n\nproperty in Rhode Island were disadvantaged by being part of a\n\ngroup required to pay their real estate taxes annually rather\n\nthan quarterly. These property owners, whose mortgage companies\n\nheld their tax payments in escrow, were required to pay taxes in\n\none   lump   sum;   other   property   owners,    who   paid   their    taxes\n\ndirectly to the municipalities, could choose to pay quarterly.\n\nThe quarterly payment method is more favorable to the taxpayer\n\nbecause it permits the taxpayer to receive the interest on the\n\nescrowed funds until the quarter in which payment is due.\n\n             The desires of aggrieved local taxpayers to assert\n\ntheir claims against municipal tax collectors in federal court\n\nare pitted against the comity interests urging restraint in the\n\nexercise of federal court jurisdiction over state tax matters.\n\nThe comity interests prevail: the plaintiffs are left to the\n\nrecourse available to them in state court.              We reject as well\n\nthe claim that certain private actors are state actors and\n\naffirm the dismissal of pendent state claims.\n\n                                     I.\n\n             The escrow accounts relevant to this case were held by\n\nfederally     regulated     banks,   mortgage    companies,    and     escrow\n\n                                     -3-\n\fagents.     Under the authority of the Real Estate Settlement\n\nProcedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. §§ 2601-2617 (2000), the\n\nfederal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), has\n\npromulgated a regulation, known as Regulation X, which reads in\n\nrelevant part:\n\n            For the payment of property taxes from the escrow\n            account, if a taxing jurisdiction offers a servicer a\n            choice between annual and installment disbursements,\n            the servicer must also comply with this paragraph\n            (k)(3). If the taxing jurisdiction neither offers a\n            discount for disbursements on a lump sum annual basis\n            nor imposes any additional charge or fee for\n            installment disbursements, the servicer must make\n            disbursements on an installment basis.\n\n63   Fed.   Reg.   3214,   3237   (Jan.     21,   1998)    (emphasis    added)\n\n(codified    at    24   C.F.R.    §   3500.17(k)(3)        (2001)).1      This\n\nrequirement benefits the borrower because                 quarterly    payment\n\n\n      1   We note that HUD issued the rule containing the\nlanguage we quote in January 1998, after some but not all of the\nevents relevant to this litigation had already occurred. HUD\nstates in its contemporaneous summary of the 1998 rule that this\nlanguage merely clarifies its earlier rule, issued in October\n1994. See 63 Fed. Reg. 3214, 3214 (\"[T]his rule maintains the\ncurrent requirements under Regulation X, but clarifies them.\");\nsee also 59 Fed. Reg. 53,890, 53,893 (Oct. 26, 1994) (\"Unless\nthere is a discount to the borrower for early payments, the\nregulation does not allow servicers to pay installment payments\non an annual or other prepayment basis.\"). Exactly what rule\nwas in force at what time could be important to a resolution of\nthis case on the merits.      Our view of the case, however,\nrequires no further discussion of the matter.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fgenerally makes more sense for borrowers than does an up-front\n\nlump       sum   annual    payment.    The   following   paragraph    of   the\n\nregulation permits the borrower and loan servicer to agree\n\notherwise, provided the agreement is voluntary and uncoerced.\n\n24 C.F.R. § 3500.17(k)(4).             RESPA regulates the mortgage and\n\nescrow companies; it does not regulate municipalities.\n\n                 After the passage of Regulation X, many lenders in\n\nRhode Island continued to make annual, rather than quarterly,\n\npayments of property taxes from escrow accounts.            The difference\n\nin treatment between payments from escrow accounts and direct\n\npayments         from     taxpayers   had    arisen   because   the   taxing\n\nmunicipalities took the position that taxpayers who paid through\n\nescrow accounts were not \"persons assessed\" entitled to make\n\npayment on a quarterly basis under the relevant statute, R.I.\n\nGen. Laws § 44-5-7.2          On this interpretation of Rhode Island law,\n\n\n       2\n                 At the time, that section provided in its entirety:\n\n                 Every city and town shall make provision for the\n                 payment in installments of any tax levied under the\n                 provisions of § 44-5-1 by adding to and making a part\n                 of the resolution ordering the assessment and the\n                 collection of the tax an option permitting persons\n                 assessed to pay their taxes in equal quarterly\n                 installments if they so desire, the amounts and dates\n                 for payment of the installments to be specified in the\n\n                                       -5-\n\fthe   municipalities   were    not    \"taxing   jurisdiction[s   which]\n\noffer[ed] . . . a choice,\" 24 C.F.R. § 3500.17(k)(3), between\n\nannual and quarterly payment, so that Regulation X did not\n\napply.   Understandably unhappy with the \"overescrowing\" of their\n\naccounts, the taxpayers took their problem to the Attorney\n\nGeneral of Rhode Island, who agreed with them that Rhode Island\n\nlaw, properly read, did not permit a distinction between the two\n\ngroups of taxpayers.       In 1998 the Attorney General so advised\n\nthe various municipalities and threatened to sue them if they\n\ndid not mend their ways.\n\n           Thereafter, in 1999, the Rhode Island General Assembly\n\namended the statute.    Under that amendment, \"persons assessed\"\n\nnow expressly includes mortgage companies and escrow agents.\n\nThe   legislature   also     provided,     however,   that   local   tax\n\ncollectors who had read the statute otherwise in the past would\n\nbe considered to have followed the law.         See 1999 R.I. Pub. Laws\n\n\n\n           resolution; provided, however, that the city or town\n           may provide that the option contained in the\n           resolution shall not apply to any tax levied in an\n           amount not in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) in\n           which case the tax shall be payable in a single\n           installment.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 44-5-7 (1995) (emphasis added) (amended 1999).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fch. 493 (codified at R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-5-7 (1999)).                   The local\n\ngovernments of Rhode Island appear now to comply with the law.\n\n              Although the practice of overescrowing had ended, the\n\nplaintiff group of taxpayers still faced the problem of the loss\n\nof the use of their money due to overescrowing from 1995 to\n\n1998.    The municipalities, and not the taxpayers, had received\n\nthe interest on the sums paid prematurely.                The taxpayers felt\n\nthey were entitled to be made whole.\n\n                                        II.\n\n              Marie E. Tomaiolo and a group of other named plaintiffs\n\n(for simplicity, we will refer from now on to Tomaiolo alone)\n\nsued    the   tax    collectors   and    almost     all   of    Rhode   Island's\n\nmunicipalities        (the    \"municipal      defendants\"),       Transamerica\n\nCorporation,        and   individuals    employed    by   Transamerica      Real\n\nEstate Tax Service (TRETS).         TRETS is the nation’s largest tax\n\nservicing firm and a division of Transamerica.                 Tomaiolo alleged\n\nthat Transamerica and the individual employees (the \"escrow\n\ndefendants\") were state actors and that all the defendants\n\ncollectively:\n\n1.     deprived affected taxpayers of their property (the tax\n       payments, or at least the interest on them) without due\n       process of law (because the process due was that provided\n\n                                        -7-\n\f     by RESPA, Regulation X, and § 44-5-7) in violation of the\n     Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause;\n\n2.   interfered with the taxpayers' rights to fair and equal\n     taxation under that Amendment's Equal Protection Clause;\n\n3.   violated the taxpayers' rights under Article 1, Section 2\n     of  the   Rhode  Island   Constitution,   requiring  equal\n     distribution of the burdens of government and guaranteeing\n     due process and equal protection of the laws;\n\n4.   intentionally interfered with the taxpayers' contractual\n     relationships with their banks.\n\nTomaiolo alleged other claims, but has since abandoned them.\n\n         The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nIn a thoughtful opinion, Tomaiolo v. Transamerica Corp., 131 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 280 (D.R.I. 2001), the district court:\n\n1.   dismissed without prejudice all federal claims against the\n     municipal defendants as barred by both the Tax Injunction\n     Act and the principles of comity articulated in Fair\n     Assessment In Real Estate Ass'n, Inc. v. McNary, 454 U.S.\n     100 (1981);\n\n2.   dismissed all federal claims against the escrow defendants\n     because they were not state actors;\n\n3.   exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the state law\n     claims against the escrow defendants and granted summary\n     judgment for those defendants.\n\nThe district court never reached the question whether to certify\n\nthis case as a class action.   This appeal followed.\n\n                               III.\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f             We review the district court's rulings de novo.        See\n\nMcCarthy v. N.W. Airlines, 56 F.3d 313, 314-15 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(reviewing de novo a grant of summary judgment);             Murphy v.\n\nUnited States, 45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir. 1995) (same for a\n\ndismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction); Garita Hotel\n\nLtd. P'ship v. Ponce Fed. Bank, F.S.B., 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (same for a dismissal for failure to state a claim).\n\n             We address the questions presented by this appeal in\n\nthe following order.       First, we hold that Tomaiolo's claims for\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief are moot.           Second, we hold\n\nthat she may not recover money damages against the municipal\n\ndefendants     under the authority of Fair Assessment.        Third, we\n\nhold that the district court correctly granted summary judgment\n\non her claim under § 1983 against the escrow defendants because\n\nthose defendants were not acting under color of state law, as\n\nthat statute requires.       Fourth, we hold that the district court\n\ndid    not   abuse   its   discretion    in   exercising   supplemental\n\njurisdiction over some, but not all, of the state law claims,\n\nand that it dealt correctly with those it addressed.\n\nA.    Mootness of Claims for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f             Tomaiolo's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief\n\nare   moot    and   indeed   were   moot   before    the   district   court\n\ndismissed them.       The conduct by the municipal defendants of\n\nwhich Tomaiolo complains -- that is, their demand in alleged\n\nviolation of federal and state law that she and her class pay\n\ntheir property taxes annually rather than quarterly -- has\n\nceased.      There is, of course, the familiar principle that a\n\nrequest for injunctive or declaratory relief does not become\n\nmoot simply because a defendant voluntarily ceases the allegedly\n\nunlawful conduct.      E.g., Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw\n\nEnvtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189-93 (2000).                  The\n\nactions of the municipal defendants, however, were not voluntary\n\nbut rather compelled by superior state officials: the Attorney\n\nGeneral in 1998, and the state legislature in 1999.             Tomaiolo's\n\nclaims for injunctive and declaratory relief concern conduct\n\nwith no possibility of recurring, and are moot.                 See United\n\nStates v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953).            Counsel for\n\nTomaiolo conceded this point at oral argument.                  Tomaiolo's\n\nclaims    for   damages   remain.     We   will     address   these   claims\n\nseparately as to the municipal and the escrow defendants.\n\nB.    Dismissal of Federal Claims Against Municipal Defendants\n\n                                    -10-\n\f              The district court dismissed without prejudice the\n\nclaims against the municipal defendants on the basis that the\n\nclaims were barred by the Tax Injunction Act and by principles\n\nof comity.\n\n1.     The Tax Injunction Act, comity, and § 1983\n\n              Our   analysis    of    the     district        court's     decision    to\n\ndismiss this claim is governed by the standard laid down by the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of                 Fair Assessment in Real Estate\n\nAss'n,      Inc.    v.    McNary,    454    U.S.      100    (1981).       Under    that\n\nstandard, Tomaiolo cannot obtain damages for the administration\n\nof     a   state    tax    system     under       §    1983,       even   though    that\n\nadministration may have violated federal law, so long as state\n\nlaw provides her a plain, complete, and adequate remedy.                           Id. at\n\n116.       Before we apply Fair Assessment's standard, however, a\n\nbrief discussion of the case and subsequent developments may\n\nclarify the relevant law.\n\n              The    Tax    Injunction      Act       of    1937    provides   in    its\n\nentirety:\n\n              The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or\n              restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax\n              under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient\n              remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\f28 U.S.C. § 1341 (1994).        The Act limits the jurisdiction of the\n\nfederal courts, rather than merely restricting the remedies\n\navailable in a given civil action.            Trailer Marine Trans. Corp.\n\nv. Rivera Vazquez, 977 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           By its terms the Act applies to actions in which\n\nplaintiffs seek injunctions against state officers.                The Supreme\n\nCourt did not address the question whether the Act applies to\n\nactions in which plaintiffs seek damages until 1981.                That year,\n\nin Fair Assessment, a group of property owners brought a suit\n\nfor damages under § 1983, claiming that their county's tax\n\nassessors had denied them equal protection and deprived them of\n\ntheir property without due process of law by failing to reassess\n\nold properties in a timely fashion and by retaliating against\n\nthose who successfully appealed property assessments.                 454 U.S.\n\nat 105-06.      In deciding the case, the Supreme Court stated that\n\nit would not rely on the Tax Injunction Act.                       Id. at 107.\n\nInstead,   it    held   that    the   principle     of   comity    between    the\n\nfederal and state governments -- a principle embodied in, but\n\nnot   limited    to,    the    Act    --   barred   a    federal   court     from\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fconsidering the damages claim.   Id. at 107, 116.3   The Court said\n\nas well that the principle of comity would not apply to a case\n\nin which a state provided no \"plain, adequate, and complete\"\n\nremedy for violations of federal law in the tax collection\n\nprocess.   Id. at 116.4\n\n           The Court has since explained that what it did in Fair\n\nAssessment was to construe § 1983, in light of the principle of\n\ncomity, to provide no cause of action for damages in state tax\n\ncases.   In Lehman v. Lycoming County Children's Services Agency,\n\n458 U.S. 502 (1982), the Court noted that in Fair Assessment it\n\n\n    3     A forceful concurrence by four members of the Court\nobjected to the application of the principle of comity to an\naction for damages. The concurring justices argued that federal\ncourts properly consider comity in traditionally equitable\nactions, such as injunctive proceedings, but cannot properly do\nso in traditionally legal ones, such as damages proceedings.\nFair Assessment, 454 U.S. at 117 (Brennan, J., concurring in the\njudgment). Some of the concurring justices' concerns have since\nbeen resolved.    No reading of Fair Assessment as applying\nprinciples of equitable discretion to a damages action survived\nQuackenbush v. Allstate Insurance Co., 517 U.S. 706 (1996),\nwhich is discussed in the text.\n    4     The Court in Fair Assessment neither recognized nor\nwholly ruled out any difference between this requirement, drawn\nfrom its equitable jurisprudence, and the parallel requirement\nin the Tax Injunction Act (also drawn from equity) that to\nqualify for protection from federal intervention a state must\nprovide \"plain, speedy, and efficient\" remedies. 454 U.S. at\n116 n.8.\n\n                               -13-\n\fhad    \"conclude[d]        that   42    U.S.C.    §   1983   does    not    confer\n\njurisdiction on the federal courts to hear suits for tax refunds\n\nwhen state law provides an adequate remedy.\"                  Id. at 512 n.16.\n\nIn    National      Private     Truck    Council,     Inc.   v.     Oklahoma     Tax\n\nCommission, 515 U.S. 582 (1995), the Court stated that \"in Fair\n\nAssessment . . . the principle of noninterference with state\n\ntaxation led us to construe § 1983 narrowly.\"                Id. at 589.         Most\n\nrecently, in Quackenbush v. Allstate Insurance Co., 517 U.S. 706\n\n(1996),   the    Court      observed     that    in   National    Private       Truck\n\nCouncil it had \"indicated that Fair Assessment was a case about\n\nthe   scope    of    the    §   1983    cause    of   action.\"      Id.    at    719.\n\nAccordingly, it is clear that Fair Assessment applies to this\n\ncase, because Tomaiolo is bringing a § 1983 action for damages\n\nsuffered in the allegedly unlawful administration of a state tax\n\nsystem.       It is less clear -- as a matter of Supreme Court\n\nprecedent -- that the Tax Injunction Act itself applies.5\n\n2.    Application to this case\n\n\n      5   The law of this circuit may differ after Cumberland\nFarms, Inc. v. Tax Assessor, 116 F.3d 943 (1st Cir. 1997), which\nstates, citing National Private Truck Council and without\nfurther analysis, that the Tax Injunction Act applies directly\nto suits under § 1983 for money damages. See id. at 945. The\nresult in this case does not depend on such subtleties.\n\n                                         -14-\n\f           We proceed to apply Fair Assessment to this case.         If\n\nTomaiolo   is    alleging   that     Rhode   Island    officials   have\n\nadministered the tax system of that state in violation of the\n\nfederal Constitution, she may not bring a case in federal court\n\nso long as Rhode Island provides a remedy for such violations\n\nthat is plain, adequate, and complete.6\n\n           Tomaiolo's complaint, summarized above, demonstrates\n\nthat she is indeed alleging that the administration of Rhode\n\nIsland's   tax   system   violated    federal   law.    She   responds,\n\nhowever, that she is not challenging the validity of applicable\n\nstate law (§ 44-5-7), but is merely alleging that the municipal\n\n\n\n     6    Nothing about this case requires us to ask whether this\nquestion may ever differ from the question whether the remedy is\nplain, speedy, and efficient, a question unanswered by the\nSupreme Court in Fair Assessment. As we discuss, Rhode Island's\nremedies appear plain, speedy, efficient, complete, and\nadequate. Moreover, because the two inquiries are identical for\nthe purposes of this case, we have no occasion to consider\nwhether the rule of Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better\nEnvironment, 523 U.S. 83, 93-102 (1998), which requires courts\nto decide questions of subject matter jurisdiction before\ndeciding those that go to the merits, would require us to base\nour holding on the Tax Injunction Act rather than on Fair\nAssessment if the two inquiries diverged. Indeed, we note that\nmany courts applying the Tax Injunction Act and Fair Assessment\nhave in effect rolled the two inquiries into one. See, e.g.,\nKerns v. Dukes, 153 F.3d 96, 101 (3d Cir. 1998) (discussing the\neffects of the statute and the case \"taken together\").\n\n                                   -15-\n\fdefendants,         conspiring       with    the     escrow       defendants,\n\nmisinterpreted that state law; that their misinterpretation put\n\nthem       in   conflict   with   RESPA; 7   and   that   it    also     led   to\n\nconstitutional violations.           A claim that a misinterpretation of\n\nstate law led to violations of federal rights is still a claim\n\nthat local officials broke federal law in interpreting and\n\napplying        state   law.      Tomaiolo's   argument        amounts    to    a\n\ndistinction without a difference.            Moreover, if underlying her\n\nfederal arguments is a fundamental assertion that defendants\n\nviolated state law, all the more reason to defer to the state\n\nsystem to determine what state law means.\n\n                Tomaiolo does not seriously contest that Rhode Island\n\nprovides a plain, adequate, and complete remedy through which\n\ntaxpayers may contest their taxes and have their federal claims\n\nheard in state court.             See, e.g., Oster v. Tellier, 544 A.2d\n\n128, 132 (R.I. 1988) (holding certain provisions of the Rhode\n\nIsland tax code under R.I. Gen. Laws § 44 unconstitutional but\n\n\n       7\n          Because RESPA does not purport to govern municipal\nofficials, it is unclear in any event whether their actions\ncould possibly have violated rights protected by that statute.\nTo the extent that Tomaiolo bolsters her claim by relying on her\ntheory of a public-private conspiracy, we reject that theory\nbelow.\n\n                                      -16-\n\fdeclining    to   award      rebate    for     failure    of    proof    of   an\n\nascertainable amount of damages); see also Sterling Shoe Co. v.\n\nNorberg,    411   F.    Supp.   128     (D.R.I.     1976)      (\"[P]laintiff's\n\nconstitutional     attack    upon     the    adequacy    of    Rhode    Island's\n\nstatutory    scheme     to    contest        tax   assessments     is    wholly\n\ninsubstantial . . . .\").        Tomaiolo offers nothing to contradict\n\nthat conclusion.       In fact, she filed an identical action in the\n\nRhode Island Superior Court, which has effectively been stayed\n\npending the outcome of this action.\n\n            She does raise two additional arguments, which we\n\ndiscuss briefly.       First, she argues that the outcome we reach\n\nconflicts with the historical role of the federal courts as a\n\nforum for the enforcement of federal rights, citing cases such\n\nas Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment & Housing Authority, 479 U.S.\n\n418 (1980), in which the Court held that § 1983 provided a cause\n\nof action for residents of federally funded public housing\n\nagainst the local housing authority that administered their\n\nprogram.     In   Fair Assessment itself, the Court balanced the\n\nconceded interests of § 1983 plaintiffs in a federal forum\n\nagainst the interests of state and local defendants in the\n\nuninterrupted operation of their tax systems.                  454 U.S. at 116\n\n                                      -17-\n\f(noting that the Court reached its result \"despite the ready\n\naccess to federal courts provided by\" Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S.\n\n167   (1961),     \"and      its    progeny\").          Tomaiolo's    argument    has\n\ntherefore already been taken into consideration in formulating\n\nthe rule we apply.\n\n           Second, she argues that this case differs from Fair\n\nAssessment because in that case the alleged official misconduct\n\nwas continuing, so that a federal court's damages award would in\n\neffect have halted it.              In this case, she says, the alleged\n\nmisconduct      has    ceased,      so       that   federal   intervention     would\n\noperate only to cure the past wrong and not to affect the\n\npresent   operation         of    the    system.      We    reject   this   argument\n\nbecause the procedure by which a state taxpayer may obtain a\n\nrefund of an allegedly illegally collected tax is no less a part\n\nof the smooth functioning of the state's tax system than the\n\ncollection   of       the   taxes       in   the    first   place.    Perhaps,    as\n\nTomaiolo maintains, the disruption we would cause by intervening\n\nwould be less on the facts of this case.                      Any such difference\n\nwould not be so great as to justify recognizing an exception to\n\nFair Assessment along the lines she proposes.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -18-\n\f            Thus, we agree that the federal claims against the\n\nmunicipal     defendants    were   properly      dismissed     under       Fair\n\nAssessment.\n\nC.    Dismissal of Federal Claims Against Escrow Defendants\n\n            Tomaiolo alleged that the escrow defendants acted under\n\ncolor of state law and thus could be reached under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983.   Unless the escrow defendants were state actors, either\n\ndirectly or by a close enough nexus to the state in defined\n\nways, there is neither a § 1983 claim nor a claim against them\n\nfor violation of constitutional rights.                See Yeo v. Town of\n\nLexington,    131    F.3d   241,   248-49    &   n.3    (1st       Cir.   1997)\n\n(discussing the requirement of state action for claims under the\n\nFourteenth Amendment and § 1983).         We do not reach the question\n\nwhether Tomaiolo otherwise asserts a cognizable claim that her\n\nconstitutional rights and those of her class were violated.\n\n            We summarize briefly the relevant facts.                On a grant\n\nof summary judgment, these facts are read in the light most\n\nfavorable to Tomaiolo.       McCarthy, 56 F.3d at 314.             HUD issued\n\nthe   amendments    to   Regulation   X   relevant     to   this    action   in\n\nOctober 1994.       TRETS then or shortly thereafter realized that\n\nthe amendments would change the way it handled escrow accounts\n\n                                   -19-\n\facross the country.    Mark Williams, who managed TRETS operations\n\nacross several New England states, directed James Houghton, who\n\nworked for TRETS in Rhode Island, to determine the position of\n\nRhode Island's municipal tax collectors as to whether their\n\nmunicipalities required annual payment of property taxes, or\n\npermitted quarterly payment.         Williams and Houghton, together\n\nwith Beni Osuna, a TRETS employee in Dallas who led the TRETS\n\ntask force working on Regulation X, appear at that time to have\n\nbelieved that Rhode Island state law left this choice to each\n\nmunicipality.\n\n            Houghton visited many of the municipal defendants,\n\nexplaining    the   content   and    effects   of   the   amendments   to\n\nRegulation X, and distributing to at least some of them a two-\n\npage summary of the amendments prepared by TRETS.           He also told\n\nthem that unless they issued letters requiring annual payment of\n\nproperty taxes from escrow accounts, TRETS would make quarterly\n\npayments.     Shortly thereafter, over thirty of the municipal\n\ndefendants sent out a total of thirty-three letters of the sort\n\nHoughton had mentioned.       Some of the letters are substantially\n\nthe same; Houghton appears to have carried copies from one\n\nmunicipality to another.\n\n                                    -20-\n\f           Tomaiolo argues that the escrow defendants themselves\n\nmisinterpreted       Rhode     Island        law,     communicated       that\n\nmisinterpretation to the municipal defendants, and then induced\n\nthe sending of some thirty-three virtually identical letters\n\nfrom the municipal defendants back to the escrow defendants\n\nadopting     that    misinterpretation,        thus     leading     to   the\n\nconstitutional violations.           This is a form of \"entwinement\"\n\nstate    action   theory,    under   which    nominally   private    action\n\nbecomes so mixed and intermingled with state action that it can\n\nno longer be called truly private.\n\n           The latest Supreme Court cases to address whether\n\napparently private actors may be considered state actors on an\n\nentwinement theory are Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary\n\nSchool    Athletic   Ass'n,    531    U.S.   288    (2001),   and   National\n\nCollegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Tarkanian, 488 U.S. 179 (1988).\n\nBrentwood held that the activities of an athletic association\n\nwithin a single state could fairly be treated as those of the\n\nstate itself, because \"[t]he nominally private character of the\n\nAssociation [was] overborne by the pervasive entwinement of\n\npublic institutions and public officials in its composition and\n\nworkings, and there is no substantial reason to claim unfairness\n\n                                     -21-\n\fin applying constitutional standards to it.\"            531 U.S. at 298.\n\nIn    contrast,   in   Tarkanian,   the    activities   of   a   multistate\n\nathletic association were those of a collective membership, and\n\nthe association was not the surrogate of any state.              488 U.S. at\n\n193-94.\n\n            Here, to be sure, enforcement of state tax laws and\n\ncollection of state taxes is emphatically a state function.             But\n\nthe    classic    indicia   of   entwinement,    much   less      pervasive\n\nentwinement, are missing.        There is no financial support from\n\nthe state to the escrow defendants, much less any support that\n\ninterplays with the decisions taken; nor is there any allocation\n\nof traditional state functions to the private entities.                Also\n\nlacking is any evidence that the government is the real actor\n\nbehind a private facade, joining in a charade designed to evade\n\nconstitutional prohibitions.8\n\n\n       8  Thus, for example, in Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co., 398\nU.S. 144 (1970), on which Tomaiolo relies, the Court held in\nreversing summary judgment for the defendant, a private\nrestaurant, that the plaintiff might be able to establish facts\nat trial showing that that the restaurant had in effect become\na state actor. In that case, Adickes was refused service in the\nrestaurant, allegedly because she was a white woman in the\ncompany of black children; she offered evidence that would allow\na jury to find that a police officer (who subsequently arrested\nAdickes for vagrancy) had reached an understanding with the\n\n                                    -22-\n\f            At most there is an argument that the escrow defendants\n\nsomehow caused or induced the municipal actors to take the steps\n\nthey did.      An \"inducement\" theory is a particularly weak and\n\nproblematic theory of state action, often rejected.          See Roche\n\nv. John Hancock Mut. Life. Ins. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 253-54 (1st\n\nCir.   1996)   (affirming   a   grant   of   summary   judgment   for    a\n\ncorporate employer whose agents reported to the police their\n\nsuspicions that a laid-off employee had made harassing phone\n\ncalls); Alexis v. McDonald's Rests. of Mass., Inc., 67 F.3d 341,\n\n351-52 (1st Cir. 1995) (affirming a grant of summary judgment\n\nfor a restaurant manager who called the police to remove a\n\npatron); see also Tarkanian, 488 U.S. at 192 (observing that\n\nsuch a claim \"mirrors the traditional state-action case\").              It\n\nhas sometimes been accepted on particularly compelling facts.\n\nSee, e.g., Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 210-11 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (affirming a jury verdict against a private citizen on a\n\n\n\n\nrestaurant staff that she was not to be served. Id. at 157-58.\nAdickes illustrates that courts will at times hold liable a\nprivate actor who agrees to do the unconstitutional bidding of\na public officer.   It does not govern the far different case\npresented here, in which at most a public officer -- on whom\nrested the ultimate responsibility to uphold the law -- took the\nallegedly incorrect advice of a private actor.\n\n                                 -23-\n\frecord     that    enabled   the      jury   to    find    that    because      of    the\n\ncitizen's influence \"the . . . police felt constrained to jail\n\nthe plaintiff notwithstanding the absence of any legal basis to\n\ndo so\").\n\n             The inducement theory of state action is problematic\n\nfor at least two reasons.              First, it assumes that state actors\n\ndo   not   exercise     their    independent        judgment       in   the    face    of\n\nrequests from private citizens, but merely act as puppets.\n\nSecond and more importantly, the theory may impose burdens on\n\nthe rights of private citizens to communicate with government\n\nofficials on topics of concern.                    Cf. Yeo, 131 F.3d at 255\n\n(\"Where, as here, there are First Amendment interests on both\n\nsides of the case, the analysis of whether there is state action\n\nmust proceed with care and caution.\").\n\n             Here, there is insufficient evidence that the town\n\nofficials abandoned their best judgment as to the meaning of\n\nstate law.        Tomaiolo produced evidence that many of the letters\n\nsent by the municipal defendants contained similar or identical\n\nlanguage, and that many of the letters were sent soon after\n\nHoughton's        visits.       She    also       argues    that    the       municipal\n\ndefendants shared an incentive to adopt the reading of state law\n\n                                        -24-\n\fthat they did.         From this, a jury could find that some of the\n\nmunicipal defendants saw letters written by the others, that\n\nHoughton had carried the letters from one defendant to another,\n\nand even that Houghton had suggested that the defendants send\n\nthe letters out.        Such findings would not support the degree of\n\nsubstitution of private judgment for public judgment required to\n\nconvert the escrow defendants' acts into state action.\n\n          The second problem with the inducement theory of state\n\naction is very real here.          The escrow defendants had every\n\nreason to contact the town officials to obtain clarification of\n\nstate law.       Indeed, Regulation X by its terms required more\n\nfavorable treatment only if state law permitted it.             It was thus\n\nin order to comply with a federal law, Regulation X, that they\n\ninitiated the contact.       A finding that these private actors were\n\nstate actors, even if they can arguably be said to have induced\n\nthe particular statutory interpretations by the state actors,\n\nmight well chill the exercise of their own rights to communicate\n\nwith government.        Several circuits have held, and this one has\n\nat least hinted, that in view of the First Amendment the courts\n\nshould   avoid    an    interpretation    of   §   1983   so   broad   as   to\n\nencompass petitions for government action.                 See Tarpley v.\n\n                                   -25-\n\fKeistler, 188 F.3d 788, 793-95 (7th Cir. 1999) (collecting\n\ncases);9 cf. Munoz Vargas v. Romero Barcelo, 532 F.2d 765, 766\n\n(1st Cir. 1976) (\"[T]here is no remedy . . . against private\n\npersons who urge the enactment of laws, regardless of their\n\nmotives.\").\n\n          In sum, the inducement theory, acceptable only on\n\nextreme facts, requires far more than Tomaiolo has shown.      As a\n\nmatter of law, her claim that the escrow defendants engaged in\n\nstate action fails.\n\nD.   Pendent State-Law Claims\n\n1.   Supplemental jurisdiction\n\n          Once the federal claims were dismissed, it was within\n\nthe discretion of the district court to exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1367 over Tomaiolo's state law\n\nclaims.   Roche, 81 F.3d at 256-57.     The court did not abuse its\n\n\n     9    These courts have relied on the Supreme Court's cases\nof Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor\nFreight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127 (1961), and United Mine Workers of\nAmerica v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657 (1965), which established\nwhat is now commonly referred to as the Noerr-Pennington\ndoctrine. That doctrine originated in the law of antitrust, but\nin cases such as Tarpley and its predecessors the courts have\nextended it to other federal statutes that provide causes of\naction so broad as potentially to chill the constitutionally\nprotected right to petition the government.\n\n                                 -26-\n\fdiscretion   in   exercising   its   jurisdiction   over   the   claims\n\nagainst the escrow defendants.       The litigation was far advanced:\n\nthe court had before it cross-motions for summary judgment,\n\ndiscovery had closed, Tomaiolo had filed her sixth amended\n\ncomplaint, and all claims arose from the same core of facts.\n\nThat exercise of jurisdiction quite furthered judicial economy.\n\nMoreover, we perceive no unfairness: Tomaiolo chose to be in\n\nfederal court, and once there received ample opportunity to\n\nlitigate all of her claims, federal and state.\n\n2.   State constitutional claims\n\n          Tomaiolo asserted that both the municipal defendants\n\nand the escrow defendants had violated Article 1, Section 2 of\n\nthe Constitution of Rhode Island, which provides that:\n\n          The burdens of the state ought to be fairly\n          distributed among its citizens.   No person shall be\n          deprived of life, liberty or property without due\n          process of law, nor shall any person be denied equal\n          protection of the law.\n\nThe first sentence of this section, regarding the burdens of the\n\nstate, is either judicially unenforceable or else imposes the\n\nsame constraint as the later reference to equal protection.\n\nTown of Lincoln v. City of Pawtucket, 745 A.2d 139, 146 (R.I.\n\n2000).   The second sentence incorporates language similar to\n\n                                 -27-\n\fthat of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the\n\nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution.       In\n\ninterpreting that sentence, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has\n\nnoted the similarity and has engaged in a state action inquiry\n\nsimilar to that in Brentwood and Tarkanian.      See, e.g., Kleczek\n\nv. R.I. Interscholastic League, Inc., 612 A.2d 734, 735-36 (R.I.\n\n1992).    The district court therefore correctly concluded that\n\nwithout state action by the escrow defendants, Tomaiolo's state\n\nconstitutional claim against them could not succeed.\n\n           Although the district court did not explicitly discuss\n\nthe      state   constitutional     claim   against   the   municipal\n\ndefendants, the logic behind dismissing the federal claims out\n\nof deference to the state system would suggest similar deference\n\nas to the state constitutional claim.       We understand the court\n\nto have declined to exercise its jurisdiction over this claim,\n\nand approve.\n\n3.    State tort claims\n\n           We agree with the district court's concise analysis\n\ndismissing these claims against the escrow defendants and see no\n\nneed to add to the discussion.      1st Cir. R. 27.1.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\f                              IV.\n\n         We modify the judgment of the district court to dismiss\n\nwith prejudice all claims for injunctive and declaratory relief\n\nas moot, and in all other respects we affirm the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court.

These property owners, whose mortgage companies held their tax payments in escrow, were required to pay taxes in one lump sum; other property owners, who paid their taxes directly to the municipalities, could choose to pay quarterly. The quarterly payment method is more favorable to the taxpayer because it permits the taxpayer to receive the interest on the escrowed funds until the quarter in which payment is due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The desires of aggrieved local taxpayers to assert their claims against municipal tax collectors in federal court are pitted against the comity interests urging restraint in the exercise of federal court jurisdiction over state tax matters. The comity interests prevail: the plaintiffs are left to the recourse available to them in state court. We reject as well the claim that certain private actors are state actors and affirm the dismissal of pendent state claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The escrow accounts relevant to this case were held by federally regulated banks, mortgage companies, and escrow agents. Under the authority of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2601-2617 (2000), the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), has promulgated a regulation, known as Regulation X, which reads in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the payment of property taxes from the escrow account, if a taxing jurisdiction offers a servicer a choice between annual and installment disbursements, the servicer must also comply with this paragraph (k)(3). If the taxing jurisdiction neither offers a discount for disbursements on a lump sum annual basis nor imposes any additional charge or fee for installment disbursements, the servicer must make disbursements on an installment basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">63 Fed. Reg. 3214, 3237 (Jan. 21, 1998) (emphasis added) (codified at 24 C.F.R. &#167; 3500.17(k)(3) (2001)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> This requirement benefits the borrower because quarterly payment generally makes more sense for borrowers than does an up-front lump sum annual payment. The following paragraph of the regulation permits the borrower and loan servicer to agree otherwise, provided the agreement is voluntary and uncoerced. 24 C.F.R. &#167; 3500.17(k)(4). RESPA regulates the mortgage and escrow companies; it does not regulate municipalities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the passage of Regulation X, many lenders in Rhode Island continued to make annual, rather than quarterly, payments of property taxes from escrow accounts. The difference in treatment between payments from escrow accounts and direct payments from taxpayers had arisen because the taxing municipalities took the position that taxpayers who paid through escrow accounts were not \"persons assessed\" entitled to make payment on a quarterly basis under the relevant statute, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 44-5-7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On this interpretation of Rhode Island law, the municipalities were not \"taxing jurisdiction[s which] offer[ed]... a choice,\" 24 C.F.R. &#167; 3500.17(k)(3), between annual and quarterly payment, so that Regulation X did not apply. Understandably unhappy with the \"overescrowing\" of their accounts, the taxpayers took their problem to the Attorney General of Rhode Island, who agreed with them that Rhode Island law, properly read, did not permit a distinction between the two groups of taxpayers. In 1998 the Attorney General so advised the various municipalities and threatened to sue them if they did not mend their ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in 1999, the Rhode Island General Assembly amended the statute. Under that amendment, \"persons assessed\" now expressly includes mortgage companies and escrow agents. The legislature also provided, however, that local tax collectors who had read the statute otherwise in the past would be considered to have followed the law. <i>See</i> 1999 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 493 (codified at R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 44-5-7 (1999)). The local governments of Rhode Island appear now to comply with the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the practice of overescrowing had ended, the plaintiff group of taxpayers still faced the problem of the loss of the use of their money due to overescrowing from 1995 to 1998. The municipalities, and not the taxpayers, had received the interest on the sums paid prematurely. The taxpayers felt they were entitled to be made whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Marie E. Tomaiolo and a group of other named plaintiffs (for simplicity, we will refer from now on to Tomaiolo alone) sued the tax collectors and almost all of Rhode Island's municipalities (the \"municipal defendants\"), Transamerica Corporation, and individuals employed by Transamerica Real Estate Tax Service (TRETS). TRETS is the nation's largest tax servicing firm and a division of Transamerica. Tomaiolo alleged that Transamerica and the individual employees (the \"escrow defendants\") were state actors and that all the defendants collectively:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. deprived affected taxpayers of their property (the tax payments, or at least the interest on them) without due process of law (because the process due was that provided by RESPA, Regulation X, and &#167; 44-5-7) in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. interfered with the taxpayers' rights to fair and equal taxation under that Amendment's Equal Protection Clause;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. violated the taxpayers' rights under Article 1, Section 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution, requiring equal distribution of the burdens of government and guaranteeing due process and equal protection of the laws;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. intentionally interfered with the taxpayers' contractual relationships with their banks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo alleged other claims, but has since abandoned them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In a thoughtful opinion, <i>Tomaiolo v. Transamerica Corp.,</i> 131 F.Supp.2d 280 (D.R.I.2001), the district court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. dismissed without prejudice all federal claims against the municipal defendants as barred by both the Tax Injunction Act and the principles of comity articulated in <i>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Ass'n, Inc. v. McNary,</i> 454 U.S. 100, 102 S.Ct. 177, 70 L.Ed.2d 271 (1981);</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. dismissed all federal claims against the escrow defendants because they were not state actors;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims against the escrow defendants and granted summary judgment for those defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court never reached the question whether to certify this case as a class action. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's rulings de novo. <i>See McCarthy v. Northwest Airlines,</i> 56 F.3d 313, 314-15 (1st Cir.1995) (reviewing de novo a grant of summary judgment); <i>Murphy v. United States,</i> 45 F.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir.1995) (same for a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction); <i>Garita Hotel Ltd. P'ship v. Ponce Fed. Bank, F.S.B.,</i> 958 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1992) (same for a dismissal for failure to state a claim).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We address the questions presented by this appeal in the following order. First, we hold that Tomaiolo's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are moot. Second, we hold that she may not recover money damages against the municipal defendants under the authority of <i>Fair Assessment.</i> Third, we hold that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on her claim under &#167; 1983 against the escrow defendants because those defendants were not acting under color of state law, as that statute requires. Fourth, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in exercising supplemental jurisdiction over some, but not all, of the state law claims, and that it dealt correctly with those it addressed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Mootness of Claims for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief are moot and indeed were moot before the district court dismissed them. The conduct by the municipal defendants of which Tomaiolo complains &#8212; that is, their demand in alleged violation of federal and state law that she and her class pay their property taxes annually rather than quarterly &#8212; has ceased. There is, of course, the familiar principle that a request for injunctive or declaratory relief does not become moot simply because a defendant voluntarily ceases the allegedly unlawful conduct. <i>E.g., Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc.,</i> 528 U.S. 167, 189-93, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). The actions of the municipal defendants, however, were not voluntary but rather compelled by superior state officials: the Attorney General in 1998, and the state legislature in 1999. Tomaiolo's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief concern conduct with no possibility of recurring, and are moot. <i>See United States v. W.T. Grant Co.,</i> 345 U.S. 629, 633, 73 S.Ct. 894, 97 L.Ed. 1303 (1953). Counsel for Tomaiolo conceded this point at oral argument. Tomaiolo's claims for damages remain. We will address these claims separately as to the municipal and the escrow defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Dismissal of Federal Claims Against Municipal Defendants</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed without prejudice the claims against the municipal defendants on the basis that the claims were barred by the Tax Injunction Act and by principles of comity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Tax Injunction Act, comity, and &#167; 1983</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our analysis of the district court's decision to dismiss this claim is governed by the standard laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of <i>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Ass'n, Inc. v. McNary,</i> 454 U.S. 100, 102 S.Ct. 177, 70 L.Ed.2d 271 (1981). Under that standard, Tomaiolo cannot obtain damages for the administration of a state tax system under &#167; 1983, even though that administration may have violated federal law, so long as state law provides her a plain, complete, and adequate remedy. <i>Id.</i> at 116, 102 S.Ct. 177. Before we apply <i>Fair Assessment</i>'s standard, however, a brief discussion of the case and subsequent developments may clarify the relevant law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Injunction Act of 1937 provides in its entirety:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 (1994). The Act limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts, rather than merely restricting the remedies available in a given civil action. <i>Trailer Marine Transport Corp. v. Rivera Vazquez,</i> 977 F.2d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms the Act applies to actions in which plaintiffs seek injunctions against state officers. The Supreme Court did not address the question whether the Act applies to actions in which plaintiffs seek damages until 1981. That year, in <i>Fair Assessment,</i> a group of property owners brought a suit for damages under &#167; 1983, claiming that their county's tax assessors had denied them equal protection and deprived them of their property without due process of law by failing to reassess old properties in a timely fashion and by retaliating against those who successfully appealed property assessments. 454 U.S. at 105-06, 102 S.Ct. 177. In deciding the case, the Supreme Court stated that it would not rely on the Tax Injunction Act. <i>Id.</i> at 107, 102 S.Ct. 177. Instead, it held that the principle of comity between the federal and state governments &#8212; a principle embodied in, but not limited to, the Act &#8212; barred a federal court from considering the damages claim. <i>Id.</i> at 107, 116, 102 S.Ct. 177.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Court said as well that the principle of comity would not apply to a case in which a state provided no \"plain, adequate, and complete\" remedy for violations of federal law in the tax collection process. <i>Id.</i> at 116, 102 S.Ct. 177.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has since explained that what it did in <i>Fair Assessment</i> was to construe &#167; 1983, in light of the principle of comity, to provide no cause of action for damages in state tax cases. In <i>Lehman v. Lycoming County Children's Services Agency,</i> 458 U.S. 502, 102 S.Ct. 3231, 73 L.Ed.2d 928 (1982), the Court noted that in <i>Fair Assessment</i> it had \"conclude[d] that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 does not confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to hear suits for tax refunds when state law provides an adequate remedy.\" <i>Id.</i> at 512 n. 16, 102 S.Ct. 3231. In <i>National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Commission,</i> 515 U.S. 582, 115 S.Ct. 2351, 132 L.Ed.2d 509 (1995), the Court stated that \"in <i>Fair Assessment</i>... the principle of noninterference with state taxation led us to construe &#167; 1983 narrowly.\" <i>Id.</i> at 589, 115 S.Ct. 2351. Most recently, in <i>Quackenbush v. Allstate Insurance Co.,</i> 517 U.S. 706, 116 S.Ct. 1712, 135 L.Ed.2d 1 (1996), the Court observed that in <i>National Private Truck Council</i> it had \"indicated that <i>Fair Assessment</i> was a case about the scope of the &#167; 1983 cause of action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 719, 116 S.Ct. 1712. Accordingly, it is clear that <i>Fair Assessment</i> applies to this case, because Tomaiolo is bringing a &#167; 1983 action for damages suffered in the allegedly unlawful administration of a state tax system. It is less clear &#8212; as a matter of Supreme Court precedent &#8212; that the Tax Injunction Act itself applies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Application to this case</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We proceed to apply <i>Fair Assessment</i> to this case. If Tomaiolo is alleging that Rhode Island officials have administered the tax system of that state in violation of the federal Constitution, she may not bring a case in federal court so long as Rhode Island provides a remedy for such violations that is plain, adequate, and complete.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo's complaint, summarized above, demonstrates that she is indeed alleging that the administration of Rhode Island's tax system violated federal law. She responds, however, that she is not challenging the validity of applicable state law (&#167; 44-5-7), but is merely alleging that the municipal defendants, conspiring with the escrow defendants, misinterpreted that state law; that their misinterpretation put them in conflict with RESPA;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and that it also led to constitutional violations. A claim that a misinterpretation of state law led to violations of federal rights is still a claim that local officials broke federal law in interpreting and applying state law. Tomaiolo's argument amounts to a distinction without a difference. Moreover, if underlying her federal arguments is a fundamental assertion that defendants violated state law, all the more reason to defer to the state system to determine what state law means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo does not seriously contest that Rhode Island provides a plain, adequate, and complete remedy through which taxpayers may contest their taxes and have their federal claims heard in state court. <i>See, e.g., Oster v. Tellier,</i> 544 A.2d 128, 132 (R.I.1988) (holding certain provisions of the Rhode Island tax code under R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 44 unconstitutional but declining to award rebate for failure of proof of an ascertainable amount of damages); <i>see also Sterling Shoe Co. v. Norberg,</i> 411 F.Supp. 128 (D.R.I.1976) (\"[P]laintiff's constitutional attack upon the adequacy of Rhode Island's statutory scheme to contest tax assessments is wholly insubstantial....\"). Tomaiolo offers nothing to contradict that conclusion. In fact, she filed an identical action in the Rhode Island Superior Court, which has effectively been stayed pending the outcome of this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">She does raise two additional arguments, which we discuss briefly. First, she argues that the outcome we reach conflicts with the historical role of the federal courts as a forum for the enforcement of federal rights, citing cases such as <i>Wright v. Roanoke Redevelopment &amp; Housing Authority,</i> 479 U.S. 418, 107 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed.2d 781 (1987), in which the Court held that &#167; 1983 provided a cause of action for residents of federally funded public housing against the local housing authority that administered their program. In <i>Fair Assessment</i> itself, the Court balanced the conceded interests of &#167; 1983 plaintiffs in a federal forum against the interests of state and local defendants in the uninterrupted operation of their tax systems. 454 U.S. at 116, 102 S.Ct. 177 (noting that the Court reached its result \"despite the ready access to federal courts provided by\" <i>Monroe v. Pape,</i> 365 U.S. 167, 81 S.Ct. 473, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961), \"and its progeny\"). Tomaiolo's argument has therefore already been taken into consideration in formulating the rule we apply.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, she argues that this case differs from <i>Fair Assessment</i> because in that case the alleged official misconduct was continuing, so that a federal court's damages award would in effect have halted it. In this case, she says, the alleged misconduct has ceased, so that federal intervention would operate only to cure the past wrong and not to affect the present operation of the system. We reject this argument because the procedure by which a state taxpayer may obtain a refund of an allegedly illegally collected tax is no less a part of the smooth functioning of the state's tax system than the collection of the taxes in the first place. Perhaps, as Tomaiolo maintains, the disruption we would cause by intervening would be less on the facts of this case. Any such difference would not be so great as to justify recognizing an exception to <i>Fair Assessment</i> along the lines she proposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, we agree that the federal claims against the municipal defendants were properly dismissed under <i>Fair Assessment.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Dismissal of Federal Claims Against Escrow Defendants</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo alleged that the escrow defendants acted under color of state law and thus could be reached under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. Unless the escrow defendants were state actors, either directly or by a close enough nexus to the state in defined ways, there is neither a &#167; 1983 claim nor a claim against them for violation of constitutional rights. <i>See Yeo v. Town of Lexington,</i> 131 F.3d 241, 248-49 &amp; n. 3 (1st Cir.1997) (discussing the requirement of state action for claims under the Fourteenth Amendment and &#167; 1983). We do not reach the question whether Tomaiolo otherwise asserts a cognizable claim that her constitutional rights and those of her class were violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We summarize briefly the relevant facts. On a grant of summary judgment, these facts are read in the light most favorable to Tomaiolo. <i>McCarthy,</i> 56 F.3d at 314. HUD issued the amendments to Regulation X relevant to this action in October 1994. TRETS then or shortly thereafter realized that the amendments would change the way it handled escrow accounts across the country. Mark Williams, who managed TRETS operations across several New England states, directed James Houghton, who worked for TRETS in Rhode Island, to determine the position of Rhode Island's municipal tax collectors as to whether their municipalities required annual payment of property taxes, or permitted quarterly payment. Williams and Houghton, together with Beni Osuna, a TRETS employee in Dallas who led the TRETS task force working on Regulation X, appear at that time to have believed that Rhode Island state law left this choice to each municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houghton visited many of the municipal defendants, explaining the content and effects of the amendments to Regulation X, and distributing to at least some of them a two-page summary of the amendments prepared by TRETS. He also told them that unless they issued letters requiring annual payment of property taxes from escrow accounts, TRETS would make quarterly payments. Shortly thereafter, over thirty of the municipal defendants sent out a total of thirty-three letters of the sort Houghton had mentioned. Some of the letters are substantially the same; Houghton appears to have carried copies from one municipality to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo argues that the escrow defendants themselves misinterpreted Rhode Island law, communicated that misinterpretation to the municipal defendants, and then induced the sending of some thirty-three virtually identical letters from the municipal defendants back to the escrow defendants adopting that misinterpretation, thus leading to the constitutional violations. This is a form of \"entwinement\" state action theory, under which nominally private action becomes so mixed and intermingled with state action that it can no longer be called truly private.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latest Supreme Court cases to address whether apparently private actors may be considered state actors on an entwinement theory are <i>Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Ass'n,</i> 531 U.S. 288, 121 S.Ct. 924, 148 L.Ed.2d 807 (2001), and <i>National Collegiate Athletic Ass'n v. Tarkanian,</i> 488 U.S. 179, 109 S.Ct. 454, 102 L.Ed.2d 469 (1988). <i>Brentwood</i> held that the activities of an athletic association within a single state could fairly be treated as those of the state itself, because \"[t]he nominally private character of the Association [was] overborne by the pervasive entwinement of public institutions and public officials in its composition and workings, and there is no substantial reason to claim unfairness in applying constitutional standards to it.\" 531 U.S. at 298, 121 S.Ct. 924. In contrast, in <i>Tarkanian,</i> the activities of a multistate athletic association were those of a collective membership, and the association was not the surrogate of any state. 488 U.S. at 193-94, 109 S.Ct. 454.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, to be sure, enforcement of state tax laws and collection of state taxes is emphatically a state function. But the classic indicia of entwinement, much less pervasive entwinement, are missing. There is no financial support from the state to the escrow defendants, much less any support that interplays with the decisions taken; nor is there any allocation of traditional state functions to the private entities. Also lacking is any evidence that the government is the real actor behind a private facade, joining in a charade designed to evade constitutional prohibitions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At most there is an argument that the escrow defendants somehow caused or induced the municipal actors to take the steps they did. An \"inducement\" theory is a particularly weak and problematic theory of state action, often rejected. <i>See Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life. Ins. Co.,</i> 81 F.3d 249, 253-54 (1st Cir.1996) (affirming a grant of summary judgment for a corporate employer whose agents reported to the police their suspicions that a laid-off employee had made harassing phone calls); <i>Alexis v. McDonald's Rests. of Mass., Inc.,</i> 67 F.3d 341, 351-52 (1st Cir.1995) (affirming a grant of summary judgment for a restaurant manager who called the police to remove a patron); <i>see also Tarkanian,</i> 488 U.S. at 192, 109 S.Ct. 454 (observing that such a claim \"mirrors the traditional state-action case\"). It has sometimes been accepted on particularly compelling facts. <i>See, e.g., Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> 829 F.2d 196, 210-11 (1st Cir.1987) (affirming a jury verdict against a private citizen on a record that enabled the jury to find that because of the citizen's influence \"the ... police felt <i>constrained</i> to jail the plaintiff notwithstanding the absence of any legal basis to do so\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inducement theory of state action is problematic for at least two reasons. First, it assumes that state actors do not exercise their independent judgment in the face of requests from private citizens, but merely act as puppets. Second and more importantly, the theory may impose burdens on the rights of private citizens to communicate with government officials on topics of concern. <i>Cf. Yeo,</i> 131 F.3d at 255 (\"Where, as here, there are First Amendment interests on both sides of the case, the analysis of whether there is state action must proceed with care and caution.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there is insufficient evidence that the town officials abandoned their best judgment as to the meaning of state law. Tomaiolo produced evidence that many of the letters sent by the municipal defendants contained similar or identical language, and that many of the letters were sent soon after Houghton's visits. She also argues that the municipal defendants shared an incentive to adopt the reading of state law that they did. From this, a jury could find that some of the municipal defendants saw letters written by the others, that Houghton had carried the letters from one defendant to another, and even that Houghton had suggested that the defendants send the letters out. Such findings would not support the degree of substitution of private judgment for public judgment required to convert the escrow defendants' acts into state action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second problem with the inducement theory of state action is very real here. The escrow defendants had every reason to contact the town officials to obtain clarification of state law. Indeed, Regulation X by its terms required more favorable treatment only if state law permitted it. It was thus in order to comply with a federal law, Regulation X, that they initiated the contact. A finding that these private actors were state actors, even if they can arguably be said to have induced the particular statutory interpretations by the state actors, might well chill the exercise of their own rights to communicate with government. Several circuits have held, and this one has at least hinted, that in view of the First Amendment the courts should avoid an interpretation of &#167; 1983 so broad as to encompass petitions for government action. <i>See Tarpley v. Keistler,</i> 188 F.3d 788, 793-95 (7th Cir.1999) (collecting cases);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>cf. Munoz Vargas v. Romero Barcelo,</i> 532 F.2d 765, 766 (1st Cir.1976) (\"[T]here is no remedy ... against private persons who urge the enactment of laws, regardless of their motives.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the inducement theory, acceptable only on extreme facts, requires far more than Tomaiolo has shown. As a matter of law, her claim that the escrow defendants engaged in state action fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. <i>Pendent State-Law Claims</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Supplemental jurisdiction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the federal claims were dismissed, it was within the discretion of the district court to exercise supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367 over Tomaiolo's state law claims. <i>Roche,</i> 81 F.3d at 256-57. The court did not abuse its discretion in exercising its jurisdiction over the claims against the escrow defendants. The litigation was far advanced: the court had before it cross-motions for summary judgment, discovery had closed, Tomaiolo had filed her sixth amended complaint, and all claims arose from the same core of facts. That exercise of jurisdiction quite furthered judicial economy. Moreover, we perceive no unfairness: Tomaiolo chose to be in federal court, and once there received ample opportunity to litigate all of her claims, federal and state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>State constitutional claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo asserted that both the municipal defendants and the escrow defendants had violated Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution of Rhode Island, which provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burdens of the state ought to be fairly distributed among its citizens. No person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor shall any person be denied equal protection of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first sentence of this section, regarding the burdens of the state, is either judicially unenforceable or else imposes the same constraint as the later reference to equal protection. <i>Town of Lincoln v. City of Pawtucket,</i> 745 A.2d 139, 146 (R.I. 2000). The second sentence incorporates language similar to that of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. In interpreting that sentence, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has noted the similarity and has engaged in a state action inquiry similar to that in <i>Brentwood</i> and <i>Tarkanian. See, e.g., Kleczek v. R.I. Interscholastic League, Inc.,</i> 612 A.2d 734, 735-36 (R.I. 1992). The district court therefore correctly concluded that without state action by the escrow defendants, Tomaiolo's state constitutional claim against them could not succeed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court did not explicitly discuss the state constitutional claim against the municipal defendants, the logic behind dismissing the federal claims out of deference to the state system would suggest similar deference as to the state constitutional claim. We understand the court to have declined to exercise its jurisdiction over this claim, and approve.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>State tort claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's concise analysis dismissing these claims against the escrow defendants and see no need to add to the discussion. 1st Cir. R. 27.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>modify</i> the judgment of the district court to dismiss with prejudice all claims for injunctive and declaratory relief as moot, and in all other respects we affirm the judgment of the district court.

Some of the concurring justices' concerns have since been resolved. No reading of <i>Fair Assessment</i> as applying principles of equitable discretion to a damages action survived <i>Quackenbush v.

The result in this case does not depend on such subtleties.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Nothing about this case requires us to ask whether this question may ever differ from the question whether the remedy is plain, speedy, and efficient, a question unanswered by the Supreme Court in<i>Fair Assessment.</i> As we discuss, Rhode Island's remedies appear plain, speedy, efficient, complete, <i>and</i> adequate. Moreover, because the two inquiries are identical for the purposes of this case, we have no occasion to consider whether the rule of <i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 93-102, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998), which requires courts to decide questions of subject matter jurisdiction before deciding those that go to the merits, would require us to base our holding on the Tax Injunction Act rather than on <i>Fair Assessment</i> if the two inquiries diverged. Indeed, we note that many courts applying the Tax Injunction Act and Fair Assessment have in effect rolled the two inquiries into one. <i>See, e.g., Kerns v. Dukes,</i> 153 F.3d 96, 101 (3d Cir.1998) (discussing the effects of the statute and the case \"taken together\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Because RESPA does not purport to govern municipal officials, it is unclear in any event whether their actions could possibly have violated rights protected by that statute.

Kress &amp; Co.,</i> 398 U.S. 144, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970), on which Tomaiolo relies, the Court held in reversing summary judgment for the defendant, a private restaurant, that the plaintiff might be able to establish facts at trial showing that that the restaurant had in effect become a state actor. In that case, Adickes was refused service in the restaurant, allegedly because she was a white woman in the company of black children; she offered evidence that would allow a jury to find that a police officer (who subsequently arrested Adickes for vagrancy) had reached an understanding with the restaurant staff that she was not to be served. <i>Id.</i> at 157-58. <i>Adickes</i> illustrates that courts will at times hold liable a private actor who agrees to do the unconstitutional bidding of a public officer. It does not govern the far different case presented here, in which at most a public officer &#8212; on whom rested the ultimate responsibility to uphold the law &#8212; took the allegedly incorrect advice of a private actor.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> These courts have relied on the Supreme Court's cases of<i>Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.

These property owners, whose mortgage companies held their tax payments in escrow, were required to pay taxes in one lump sum; other property owners, who paid their taxes directly to the municipalities, could choose to pay quarterly. The quarterly payment method is more favorable to the taxpayer because it permits the taxpayer to receive the interest on the escrowed funds until the quarter in which payment is due.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The desires of aggrieved local taxpayers to assert their claims against municipal tax collectors in federal court are pitted against the comity interests urging restraint in the exercise of federal court jurisdiction over state tax matters. The comity interests prevail: the plaintiffs are left to the recourse available to them in state court.

Under the authority of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), 12 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2601-2617 (2000), the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), has promulgated a regulation, known as Regulation X, which reads in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the payment of property taxes from the escrow account, if a taxing jurisdiction offers a servicer a choice between annual and installment disbursements, the servicer must also comply with this paragraph (k)(3).

The difference in treatment between payments from escrow accounts and direct payments from taxpayers had arisen because the taxing municipalities took the position that taxpayers who paid through escrow accounts were not \"persons assessed\" entitled to make payment on a quarterly basis under the relevant statute, R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 44-5-7.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On this interpretation of Rhode Island law, the municipalities were not \"taxing jurisdiction[s which] offer[ed]... a choice,\" 24 C.F.R. &#167; 3500.17(k)(3), between annual and quarterly payment, so that Regulation X did not apply. Understandably unhappy with the \"overescrowing\" of their accounts, the taxpayers took their problem to the Attorney General of Rhode Island, who agreed with them that Rhode Island law, properly read, did not permit a distinction between the two groups of taxpayers. In 1998 the Attorney General so advised the various municipalities and threatened to sue them if they did not mend their ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, in 1999, the Rhode Island General Assembly amended the statute. Under that amendment, \"persons assessed\" now expressly includes mortgage companies and escrow agents. The legislature also provided, however, that local tax collectors who had read the statute otherwise in the past would be considered to have followed the law. <i>See</i> 1999 R.I. Pub. Laws ch. 493 (codified at R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 44-5-7 (1999)).

Second, we hold that she may not recover money damages against the municipal defendants under the authority of <i>Fair Assessment.</i> Third, we hold that the district court correctly granted summary judgment on her claim under &#167; 1983 against the escrow defendants because those defendants were not acting under color of state law, as that statute requires.

The conduct by the municipal defendants of which Tomaiolo complains &#8212; that is, their demand in alleged violation of federal and state law that she and her class pay their property taxes annually rather than quarterly &#8212; has ceased. There is, of course, the familiar principle that a request for injunctive or declaratory relief does not become moot simply because a defendant voluntarily ceases the allegedly unlawful conduct. <i>E.g., Friends of the Earth, Inc. v.

The actions of the municipal defendants, however, were not voluntary but rather compelled by superior state officials: the Attorney General in 1998, and the state legislature in 1999. Tomaiolo's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief concern conduct with no possibility of recurring, and are moot. <i>See United States v. W.T.

Under that standard, Tomaiolo cannot obtain damages for the administration of a state tax system under &#167; 1983, even though that administration may have violated federal law, so long as state law provides her a plain, complete, and adequate remedy. <i>Id.</i> at 116, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110581\"><a href=\"/opinion/110581/fair-assessment-in-real-estate-assn-inc-v-mcnary/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Supreme Court did not address the question whether the Act applies to actions in which plaintiffs seek damages until 1981. That year, in <i>Fair Assessment,</i> a group of property owners brought a suit for damages under &#167; 1983, claiming that their county's tax assessors had denied them equal protection and deprived them of their property without due process of law by failing to reassess old properties in a timely fashion and by retaliating against those who successfully appealed property assessments. 454 U.S. at 105-06, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110581\"><a href=\"/opinion/110581/fair-assessment-in-real-estate-assn-inc-v-mcnary/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1996), the Court observed that in <i>National Private Truck Council</i> it had \"indicated that <i>Fair Assessment</i> was a case about the scope of the &#167; 1983 cause of action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 719, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118031\"><a href=\"/opinion/118031/quackenbush-v-allstate-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Accordingly, it is clear that <i>Fair Assessment</i> applies to this case, because Tomaiolo is bringing a &#167; 1983 action for damages suffered in the allegedly unlawful administration of a state tax system. It is less clear &#8212; as a matter of Supreme Court precedent &#8212; that the Tax Injunction Act itself applies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Application to this case</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We proceed to apply <i>Fair Assessment</i> to this case. If Tomaiolo is alleging that Rhode Island officials have administered the tax system of that state in violation of the federal Constitution, she may not bring a case in federal court so long as Rhode Island provides a remedy for such violations that is plain, adequate, and complete.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo's complaint, summarized above, demonstrates that she is indeed alleging that the administration of Rhode Island's tax system violated federal law. She responds, however, that she is not challenging the validity of applicable state law (&#167; 44-5-7), but is merely alleging that the municipal defendants, conspiring with the escrow defendants, misinterpreted that state law; that their misinterpretation put them in conflict with RESPA;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> and that it also led to constitutional violations. A claim that a misinterpretation of state law led to violations of federal rights is still a claim that local officials broke federal law in interpreting and applying state law. Tomaiolo's argument amounts to a distinction without a difference. Moreover, if underlying her federal arguments is a fundamental assertion that defendants violated state law, all the more reason to defer to the state system to determine what state law means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo does not seriously contest that Rhode Island provides a plain, adequate, and complete remedy through which taxpayers may contest their taxes and have their federal claims heard in state court. <i>See, e.g., Oster v. Tellier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2180593\"><a href=\"/opinion/2180593/oster-v-tellier/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 132 (R.I.1988) (holding certain provisions of the Rhode Island tax code under R.I.

In this case, she says, the alleged misconduct has ceased, so that federal intervention would operate only to cure the past wrong and not to affect the present operation of the system. We reject this argument because the procedure by which a state taxpayer may obtain a refund of an allegedly illegally collected tax is no less a part of the smooth functioning of the state's tax system than the collection of the taxes in the first place. Perhaps, as Tomaiolo maintains, the disruption we would cause by intervening would be less on the facts of this case.

Unless the escrow defendants were state actors, either directly or by a close enough nexus to the state in defined ways, there is neither a &#167; 1983 claim nor a claim against them for violation of constitutional rights. <i>See Yeo v.

On a grant of summary judgment, these facts are read in the light most favorable to Tomaiolo. <i>McCarthy,</i> 56 F.3d at 314. HUD issued the amendments to Regulation X relevant to this action in October 1994. TRETS then or shortly thereafter realized that the amendments would change the way it handled escrow accounts across the country. Mark Williams, who managed TRETS operations across several New England states, directed James Houghton, who worked for TRETS in Rhode Island, to determine the position of Rhode Island's municipal tax collectors as to whether their municipalities required annual payment of property taxes, or permitted quarterly payment. Williams and Houghton, together with Beni Osuna, a TRETS employee in Dallas who led the TRETS task force working on Regulation X, appear at that time to have believed that Rhode Island state law left this choice to each municipality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Houghton visited many of the municipal defendants, explaining the content and effects of the amendments to Regulation X, and distributing to at least some of them a two-page summary of the amendments prepared by TRETS. He also told them that unless they issued letters requiring annual payment of property taxes from escrow accounts, TRETS would make quarterly payments. Shortly thereafter, over thirty of the municipal defendants sent out a total of thirty-three letters of the sort Houghton had mentioned. Some of the letters are substantially the same; Houghton appears to have carried copies from one municipality to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo argues that the escrow defendants themselves misinterpreted Rhode Island law, communicated that misinterpretation to the municipal defendants, and then induced the sending of some thirty-three virtually identical letters from the municipal defendants back to the escrow defendants adopting that misinterpretation, thus leading to the constitutional violations. This is a form of \"entwinement\" state action theory, under which nominally private action becomes so mixed and intermingled with state action that it can no longer be called truly private.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The latest Supreme Court cases to address whether apparently private actors may be considered state actors on an entwinement theory are <i>Brentwood Academy v.

But the classic indicia of entwinement, much less pervasive entwinement, are missing. There is no financial support from the state to the escrow defendants, much less any support that interplays with the decisions taken; nor is there any allocation of traditional state functions to the private entities. Also lacking is any evidence that the government is the real actor behind a private facade, joining in a charade designed to evade constitutional prohibitions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At most there is an argument that the escrow defendants somehow caused or induced the municipal actors to take the steps they did. An \"inducement\" theory is a particularly weak and problematic theory of state action, often rejected. <i>See Roche v. John Hancock Mut. Life. Ins. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"716599\"><a href=\"/opinion/716599/daniel-j-roche-et-ux-valerie-roche-v-john-hancock-mutual-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">249</span></a></span>, 253-54 (1st Cir.1996) (affirming a grant of summary judgment for a corporate employer whose agents reported to the police their suspicions that a laid-off employee had made harassing phone calls); <i>Alexis v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span> (observing that such a claim \"mirrors the traditional state-action case\"). It has sometimes been accepted on particularly compelling facts. <i>See, e.g., Wagenmann v. Adams,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 210-11 (1st Cir.1987) (affirming a jury verdict against a private citizen on a record that enabled the jury to find that because of the citizen's influence \"the ... police felt <i>constrained</i> to jail the plaintiff notwithstanding the absence of any legal basis to do so\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inducement theory of state action is problematic for at least two reasons. First, it assumes that state actors do not exercise their independent judgment in the face of requests from private citizens, but merely act as puppets. Second and more importantly, the theory may impose burdens on the rights of private citizens to communicate with government officials on topics of concern. <i>Cf. Yeo,</i> 131 F.3d at 255 (\"Where, as here, there are First Amendment interests on both sides of the case, the analysis of whether there is state action must proceed with care and caution.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there is insufficient evidence that the town officials abandoned their best judgment as to the meaning of state law. Tomaiolo produced evidence that many of the letters sent by the municipal defendants contained similar or identical language, and that many of the letters were sent soon after Houghton's visits. She also argues that the municipal defendants shared an incentive to adopt the reading of state law that they did. From this, a jury could find that some of the municipal defendants saw letters written by the others, that Houghton had carried the letters from one defendant to another, and even that Houghton had suggested that the defendants send the letters out. Such findings would not support the degree of substitution of private judgment for public judgment required to convert the escrow defendants' acts into state action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second problem with the inducement theory of state action is very real here. The escrow defendants had every reason to contact the town officials to obtain clarification of state law. Indeed, Regulation X by its terms required more favorable treatment only if state law permitted it. It was thus in order to comply with a federal law, Regulation X, that they initiated the contact. A finding that these private actors were state actors, even if they can arguably be said to have induced the particular statutory interpretations by the state actors, might well chill the exercise of their own rights to communicate with government. Several circuits have held, and this one has at least hinted, that in view of the First Amendment the courts should avoid an interpretation of &#167; 1983 so broad as to encompass petitions for government action. <i>See Tarpley v. Keistler,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765789\"><a href=\"/opinion/765789/robert-alan-tarpley-v-frank-keistler-jr-and-union-county-republican/\"><span class=\"volume\">188</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span>, 793-95 (7th Cir.1999) (collecting cases);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>cf.

The court did not abuse its discretion in exercising its jurisdiction over the claims against the escrow defendants. The litigation was far advanced: the court had before it cross-motions for summary judgment, discovery had closed, Tomaiolo had filed her sixth amended complaint, and all claims arose from the same core of facts. That exercise of jurisdiction quite furthered judicial economy. Moreover, we perceive no unfairness: Tomaiolo chose to be in federal court, and once there received ample opportunity to litigate all of her claims, federal and state.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>State constitutional claims</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tomaiolo asserted that both the municipal defendants and the escrow defendants had violated Article 1, Section 2 of the Constitution of Rhode Island, which provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burdens of the state ought to be fairly distributed among its citizens.

City of Pawtucket,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2087707\"><a href=\"/opinion/2087707/town-of-lincoln-v-city-of-pawtucket/\"><span class=\"volume\">745</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 146 (R.I. 2000). The second sentence incorporates language similar to that of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal Constitution. In interpreting that sentence, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has noted the similarity and has engaged in a state action inquiry similar to that in <i>Brentwood</i> and <i>Tarkanian. See, e.g., Kleczek v. R.I. Interscholastic League, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2062040\"><a href=\"/opinion/2062040/kleczek-v-ri-interscholastic-league-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">734</span></a></span>, 735-36 (R.I. 1992).

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span> (1970), on which Tomaiolo relies, the Court held in reversing summary judgment for the defendant, a private restaurant, that the plaintiff might be able to establish facts at trial showing that that the restaurant had in effect become a state actor. In that case, Adickes was refused service in the restaurant, allegedly because she was a white woman in the company of black children; she offered evidence that would allow a jury to find that a police officer (who subsequently arrested Adickes for vagrancy) had reached an understanding with the restaurant staff that she was not to be served. <i>Id.</i> at 157-58. <i>Adickes</i> illustrates that courts will at times hold liable a private actor who agrees to do the unconstitutional bidding of a public officer. It does not govern the far different case presented here, in which at most a public officer &#8212; on whom rested the ultimate responsibility to uphold the law &#8212; took the allegedly incorrect advice of a private actor.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> These courts have relied on the Supreme Court's cases of<i>Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v.
