Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                  and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n    Rafael F. Castro Lang for appellant.\n\n     Jacabed Rodríguez-Coss, Assistant United States Attorney,\nwith whom, Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E.\nVega-Pacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                      December 29, 2000\n\f\f               BOWNES,      Senior Circuit Judge.           Defendant-appellant\n\nCarlos L. Hernandez-Vega, along with eight other defendants, was\n\ntried pursuant to a three-count indictment in the District Court\n\nfor the District of Puerto Rico for drug related activities.\n\nThe indictment charged as follows: Count I, 21 U.S.C. § 848(a)\n\nand (b), continuing criminal enterprise, and 18 U.S.C. § 2,\n\naiding and abetting; Count II, 21 U.S.C. § 846, conspiracy to\n\ndistribute in excess of five kilograms of heroin, in excess of\n\nfive       kilograms   of    cocaine,   in    excess   of   five   kilograms   of\n\ncocaine base and in excess of 100 kilograms of marijuana; and\n\nCount III, 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1) & (2), unlawful use of firearms\n\nduring and in relation to a drug trafficking offense and aiding\n\nand abetting.\n\n               All nine of the defendants who stood trial were found\n\nguilty on all or some of the counts.                    We consolidated the\n\nappeals.       Seven of the defendants argued orally on September 14,\n\n2000.        The other two defendants' appeals were submitted on\n\nbriefs to the same panel.\n\n               The defendant in this case, Carlos Hernandez-Vega, was\n\nfound guilty on all three counts.                 He was sentenced to life\n\nimprisonment on Counts I and II of the indictment1 and a term of\n\nten years on Count III, to be served consecutively.                   Defendant\n\n\n       1Count II was subsequently dismissed.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fhas raised five issues on appeal, which we will discuss in the\n\norder followed in his brief.\n\n\n\n\n                                   I.    FACTS\n\n            We state the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict.    See United States v. Duclos, 214 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).     This rehearsal of the evidence does not, of course,\n\ncover the facts that are applicable only to other defendants.\n\nNor do we recite, at this juncture, all of the facts involving\n\ndefendant.       Many of the facts pertaining to particular issues\n\nwill be set forth in our discussion of the issues.                  All we do\n\nnow is state those facts that will give the reader the necessary\n\nbackground information to understand the different issues raised\n\nby defendant.\n\n            Defendant       and   Vega-Figueroa     were   in   charge     of   an\n\nextensive        criminal     enterprise       involving    the     sale        and\n\ndistribution of heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana.\n\nCooperating witnesses for the government included five former\n\nmembers     of    the   enterprise       who     sold   narcotics    for        the\n\norganization.       Their testimony can be summarized as follows.\n\n            Defendant and/or Vega-Figueroa delivered the drugs to\n\nthe various cooperating witnesses at the drug point, located in\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fa public housing project.             Members of the enterprise carjacked\n\nautomobiles on a regular basis.                The carjacked vehicles were\n\nthen used for drive-by shootings targeted against other drug\n\ndealers who operated drug points in other public housing units\n\nin competition with defendant and Vega-Figueroa.                      The drug\n\ndistribution      point   of    the    enterprise   was   guarded     by   armed\n\nmembers of the organization.              There was also testimony that\n\ndefendant and Vega-Figueroa operated a heroin drug point located\n\nwithin the Hogar Crea detention and drug rehabilitation facility\n\nin Saint Just at Trujuillo Alto, Puerto Rico.              Another drug gang\n\nousted two members of defendant’s organization from the Hogar\n\nCrea drug point.        Defendant and Vega-Figueroa ordered that the\n\ntwo   men   who   had   taken    over    the    Hogar   Crea   drug   point   be\n\nmurdered.    The men were ambushed and killed by defendant, Vega-\n\nFigueroa, and other members of defendant’s enterprise.\n\n            The indictment charged that the continuing criminal\n\nenterprise and conspiracy started on or about August 1, 1990,\n\nand continued until on or about April 10, 1997.\n\n                                 II.     ISSUES\n\n            We state the issues as phrased by defendant.2\n\n\n\n      2\n     The first issue raised by defendant is that he received\nlife sentences under both Counts I and Count II, thus violating\nprinciples of double jeopardy. As Count II has been dismissed,\nleaving only one life sentence, this point needs no discussion.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fA. Whether the district court committed\nreversible error in its instructions to the\njury   as   to  the   continuing   criminal\nenterprise charged in Count I of the\nindictment.\n\nThe district court instructed the jury as follows:\n\n   In Count I of the indictment two of the\ndefendants are charged, Jose Vega Figueroa\nand Carlos Hernandez Vega. The law makes it\na federal crime or offense for anyone to\nengage in what is called a continuing\ncriminal enterprise involving controlled\nsubstances.\n\n   A defendant can be found guilty of that\noffense only if all of the following facts\nare proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n\n       First, that the defendants violated\nSection   841(a)(1)  as  charged  in   the\nindictment.   This is the drug trafficking\ncase.\n\n       Second, that such violations were a\npart of a continuing series of violations as\nherein after defined.\n\n       Third, that such continuing series of\nviolations were undertaken by the defendants\nin concert or together with at least five or\nmore other persons.\n\n       Fourth, that the defendant occupied\nthe position of an organizer, supervisor or\nmanager.\n\n       Fifth, that the defendant obtained\nsubstantial income or resources in the\ncontinuing series of violations.\n\n       A continuing series of violation means\nproof of at least three violations under the\nFederal   controlled   substances   law,   as\ncharged in Count I of the indictment, and\n\n                    -6-\n\f         also   requires   a   finding   that   those\n         violations were connected together as a\n         series of related or ongoing activities as\n         distinguished from isolated and disconnected\n         acts. You must unanimously agree on which\n         three violations constitute the series of\n         three or more violations in order to find\n         the essential element No. 2 of this offense\n         has been proven.\n\n                It must also be proved that the\n         defendants engaged in the continuing series\n         of violations with at least five or more\n         persons, whether or not those persons are\n         named in the indictment and whether or not\n         the same five or more persons participated\n         in each of the violations, or participated\n         at different times. And, it must be proved\n         that the defendant’s relationship with the\n         other five or more persons was that of\n         organizers, supervisors or managers – that\n         the defendant’s relationship with the other\n         five or more persons was that of organizer,\n         supervisor   or   manager,  and   that   the\n         defendant was more than a fellow worker and\n         either organized or directed the activities\n         of the others, whether the defendant was the\n         only organizer or supervisor or not.\n\n                Finally, it must be proved that the\n         defendant obtained substantial income or\n         resources from the continuing series of\n         violations. This means that the defendant’s\n         income from violations, in money or other\n         property, must have been significant in size\n         or amount as distinguished from relatively\n         insubstantial,   insignificant  or   trivial\n         amount.\n\n         In Richardson v.   United States, 526 U.S. 813, 815\n\n(1999), the Court, per Justice Breyer, held:\n\n             A federal criminal statute forbids any\n         \"person\" from \"engag[ing] in a continuing\n         criminal enterprise.\" 84 Stat. 1264, 21\n\n                             -7-\n\f            U.S.C. § 848(a). It defines \"continuing\n            criminal enterprise\" (CCE) as involving a\n            \"violat[ion]\" of the drug statutes where\n            \"such violation is a part of a continuing\n            series of violations.\" § 848(c).      We must\n            decide   whether  a   jury   has   to   agree\n            unanimously about which specific violations\n            make   up   the   \"continuing    series    of\n            violations.\" We hold that the jury must do\n            so. That is to say, a jury in a federal\n            criminal case brought under § 848 must\n            unanimously   agree   not   only  that    the\n            defendant committed some \"continuing series\n            of violations\" but also that the defendant\n            committed    each    of    the    individual\n            \"violations\" necessary to make up that\n            \"continuing series.\"\n\n            Defendant   acknowledges    that     the   district   court\n\ninstructed the jury that it had to unanimously agree as to the\n\nthree violations that constituted the series of violations.          He\n\ncontends, however, that the court erred because “it failed to\n\nidentify    which   predicate   offenses   the   continuing   criminal\n\nenterprise was based upon so as to permit the jury to determine\n\nif it unanimously agreed upon said specific predicate offenses\n\nwhich should have been specifically identified in the jury\n\ninstructions.”\n\n            We read nothing in Richardson requiring such action by\n\nthe district court.      If it had instructed the jury along the\n\nlines defendant suggests, it would have usurped the function of\n\nthe jury.     Accordingly, we rule that the instruction met the\n\nRichardson requirements.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f         B.   Whether the district court committed\n         reversible error by allowing evidence of\n         drug trafficking at the Ramos Antonini\n         Housing Project during 1996 and 1997 and an\n         agent's interpretation of videotapes.\n\n         The material allowed to be introduced as evidence over\n\ndefendant’s objections included videotapes and photographs taken\n\nat the drug point in the Ramos Antonini Housing Project.                    The\n\nevidence allegedly depicted narcotic sales taking place on the\n\nfollowing dates:    April 24, May 28, May 30, May 31, June 5, June\n\n13, and June 15, 1996; and January 30, 1997.\n\n         Defendant also objected to the expert testimony of\n\nElias Negron, a member of the FBI’s Safe Streets Task Force.\n\nNegron explained to the jury how the videotapes depicted drug\n\ntransactions.      Negron also gave his expert opinion that the\n\nextended period of lack of violence at the drug point showed\n\nthat defendant and his cohorts had such secure control of the\n\ndrug point that no other drug gangs would attempt to take it\n\nover.\n\n         Defendant’s objections to the videotape evidence are\n\nbased on relevancy and Federal Rule of Evidence 403.                       The\n\nrelevancy contention is twofold:            (1) that the evidence did not\n\nprove that the drug trafficking at the drug point in the housing\n\ndevelopment   in   1996   and    1997   related   to    defendant    and    the\n\nconspiracy    charged     in    the   indictment;      and   (2)   that    both\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fdefendant and Vega-Figueroa had been absent from the Ramos\n\nAntonini Housing Project since 1995.\n\n           There was a plethora of evidence, however, as to how\n\ndefendant and Vega-Figueroa operated and strictly controlled the\n\nenterprise regardless of their occasional physical absence from\n\nPuerto Rico.   William Acevedo Rodriguez, a trusted lieutenant in\n\nthe   enterprise,   testified   as    to   the   operation   of   the   drug\n\npoints.3   Alicia Gotay Saez testified that she and her sister ran\n\na drug point in the housing project in competition with the one\n\nrun by Vega-Figueroa and defendant.          Gotay described in detail\n\nhow a drug point is operated.        She also testified that after she\n\nrefused to join Vega-Figueroa’s enterprise, her sister was shot\n\nto death at his drug point.\n\n           Ramon Caesareo Soto, who worked for a rival of the\n\ncriminal enterprise throughout the life of the conspiracy run by\n\nVega-Figueroa and defendant, described in detail the violence\n\nand killings that had taken place in the Ramos Antonini Housing\n\nProject between rival drug gangs for control of the drug trade\n\nin the project in the years 1960 to 1963.          He testified that, by\n\n\n\n\n      3\n     After Acevedo was arrested       in March of 1995, he decided to\nbecome a cooperating witness.          He was afraid that if he was\nincarcerated in the main prison       at Guayama, he would be killed\nby other inmates because he had       participated in the killing of\nfriends of theirs.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f1997, there was only one drug point in the project, which was\n\ncontrolled by the enterprise run by Vega-Figueroa and defendant.\n\n          There was evidence from which a jury could find beyond\n\na   reasonable   doubt   that     defendant         was   part    of    a    criminal\n\nenterprise and conspiracy devoted to selling illegal drugs that\n\nstarted on or about August 1, 1990, and continued through March,\n\n1997.    There    was    also    evidence       from      which   a     jury      could\n\nreasonably find that the physical presence of defendant and/or\n\nVega-Figueroa    at   all   times      was    not    necessary     to       the    daily\n\noperation of the two drug points.\n\n          The evidence described above was not the only evidence\n\nbefore the jury on drug trafficking under defendant’s and Vega-\n\nFigueroa’s   auspices.          Our    careful      scrutiny      of    the       record\n\nconvinces us that the jury verdict was based on evidence that\n\nconstituted proof beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant’s guilt\n\nas charged in the indictment.\n\n          We now turn to the objection based on the admission of\n\nvideotapes and photographs of the drug point in the public\n\nhousing project and the admission of expert testimony to explain\n\nthe tapes and photographs.            Defendant argues that this evidence\n\nshould have been excluded because it violated Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n\n          Rule 403 provides:\n\n          Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of\n          Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of Time\n\n                                       -11-\n\f                  Although relevant, evidence may be\n           excluded   if   its   probative   value   is\n           substantially outweighed by the danger of\n           unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues,\n           or misleading the jury, or by considerations\n           of undue delay, waste of time, or needless\n           presentation of cumulative evidence.\n\n           Defendant   objected     to    the   introduction   of    the\n\nvideotapes and photos as highly prejudicial because they were\n\ntaken after he had left Puerto Rico, while he was in New York\n\nState.    We point out that New York and Puerto Rico are only a\n\nshort plane ride apart and telephone communication is routine.\n\nWe have already found that defendant’s daily presence was not\n\nnecessary for the operation of the drug point.           There was no\n\nviolation of Fed. R. Evid. 403 by the introduction of the\n\nvideotapes and photos of the drug point.\n\n           Defendant also claims that it was a violation of Rule\n\n403 to allow an expert witness to explain to the jury what the\n\nvideotapes and photos depicted.      He argues that the testimony of\n\nthe expert was not necessary because the jury was capable of\n\nunderstanding what was going on without expert help.\n\n           The appropriate test for reviewing the admission or\n\nexclusion of expert testimony is abuse of discretion.          General\n\nElec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 139 (1997).        Elias Negron, a\n\nmember of the FBI’s Safe Streets Task Force, provided his expert\n\nopinion   that   the   videotapes   and    photographs   showed     drug\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\ftransactions taking place.         He also proffered his opinion that\n\nthe extended non-violent period at the housing project showed\n\nthat defendant and Vega-Figueroa were in firm control of drug\n\ntrafficking       at   the   project    and   that   no    other   drug   gangs\n\nattempted to compete with the criminal enterprise and conspiracy\n\nin which defendant played a major role.               It seems clear that\n\nunder the pertinent facts and the applicable law the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in admitting the videotapes\n\nand photos and allowing Elias Negron to testify as he did.\n\n           C.    Whether or not prosecutor’s closing\n           argument   stating   repeatedly   that   the\n           government’s evidence had gone “unrebutted”\n           and “unrefuted” constituted improper comment\n           on the silence of defendants and transferred\n           burden of proof to defendants and improper\n           argument concerning “dream” of peaceful\n           residential projects warrants granting of\n           new trial.\n\n           No objections were made by defendant to the statements\n\nby the prosecutor during her argument.                    This means that we\n\nreview for plain error.        See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\n\n1161, 1187 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           Once the prosecutor’s words are placed in context, we\n\ninquire whether “the language used was manifestly intended or\n\nwas   of   such    character    that    the   jury   would     naturally    and\n\nnecessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the\n\naccused to testify.”          Id. at 1187 (quoting United States v.\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\fGlantz, 810 F.2d 316, 322 (1st Cir. 1987) (citations omitted)).\n\nWe note that in his final charge, the judge instructed the jury\n\nthat the defendants had the right to remain silent and not\n\ntestify,   and   that   their   failure   to   testify   could   not   be\n\nconsidered as a factor in the case.\n\n           Our first task is to put the prosecutor’s words in\n\ncontext.   She began her argument by stating:\n\n                  I’d like to start by highlighting what\n           evidence we have presented to you that is\n           just simply, completely unprofitable [sic],\n           unrebuttable.\n\n                  What do we know is a fact, that\n           neither I nor any defense counsel that can\n           stand here before you can argue to the\n           contrary? What has been so well-established\n           that it is simply undeniable?\n\n                   . . . We know that on May 16th, 1994,\n           two people got killed at the Hogar Crea\n           located in Saint Just La Quinta in Carolina,\n           and that was Reinaldo Colón Gonzalez and\n           Melvin Flores Montalvo.      No doubt about\n           that.\n\n                  What else do we know about that event\n           that is completely unrefutable?     We know\n           that Daisy Serrano found 19 rifle casings at\n           the scene of these two murders.\n\n                  We know that Daisy Serrano found 18\n           .45-caliber casings at the scene of these\n           two murders. They were there. They’ve been\n           admitted here in court.   There is nothing\n           that any witness can say or that any person\n           can argue that these casings do not exist.\n           Eighteen .45-caliber casings recovered from\n           the scene of these crimes. Nineteen rifle\n           casings recovered from the scene of these\n\n                                 -14-\n\f           two murders.   They’re here.        They exist.\n           There’s no doubt about that.\n\n                  Thirty 9-millimeter casings recovered\n           at the scene of this crime. Those are here\n           also. These simply cannot go away; there’s\n           just no going around that.\n\n           It seems obvious that the prosecutor was not, even by\n\nthe broadest possible interpretation of the words “unprofitable”\n\nand   “unrebuttable,”    commenting    on   defendant’s   failure   to\n\ntestify.     What she stated were facts that were unrebuttable.\n\n           The next statement was made in the following context.\n\n                  We also know that one of those\n           individuals was carrying this revolver,\n           because   Mr.  Maldonado    told  you   that\n           projectiles recovered from the body of\n           Reynaldo   and  at   least   one  projectile\n           recovered from the body of Melvin were fired\n           by this revolver right here (indicating).\n           That’s unrebuttable.\n\n                  Where was this revolver found? This\n           revolver was found in the house of Carlos\n           Hernandez Vega.    That evidence also went\n           unrebutted before you.\n\n                  The agent who found this weapon, Edwin\n           Rodriguez, says, “I found this weapon in the\n           house of Carlos Hernandez Vega,” and Mr.\n           Maldonado says this was one of the revolvers\n           used during the commission of the murders at\n           Hogar Crea.\n\n           The context is not complete, however, without the\n\nfollowing.     There was an objection by defense counsel:\n\n                  MS.  DAVILA:   She   misstated  the\n           evidence. She said it was found in Carlos\n           Hernandez Vega’s.   What the evidence said\n\n                                -15-\n\f          was that the agent seized it from the floor\n          of the bottom of the residential project.\n                          . . . .\n\n                MS. RODRIGUEZ: We stand corrected.\n\n          The prosecutor acknowledged that she had incorrectly\n\nstated the testimony of a witness.\n\n          The next comment and context is as follows.\n\n                 And it just so happens that one of the\n          other weapons used in the murders is found\n          in Carlos Hernandez Vega’s and at least one\n          other person who William Acevedo Rodriguez\n          says was with him admits to Agent Luis\n          Negron and to Agent Vazquez of the FBI that\n          he is indeed guilty of the Hogar Crea\n          murders.   It’s unrefutable evidence.    It’s\n          unrebuttable.\n\n          Acevedo was a former member of the enterprise and\n\nconspiracy.    He   was   one   of   the   chief   witnesses   for   the\n\ngovernment.   His admission to murder is hardly the type of\n\nstatement that the jury would think that defendant would want to\n\nanswer.\n\n          The next statement in context was:\n\n          Now, what else, what other evidence has come\n          before you that is unrebuttable, undisputed?\n\n                 Well, we know that at least one wound\n          on Reynaldo Colón Gonzalez’s body was fired\n          from a distance of less than 2 feet.\n          Whoever fired the shot that made that tattoo\n          which Dr. Rosa Figueroa explained to you is\n          caused by gun powder particles which are\n          lodged on the skin when the gun is being\n          held at a close distance from the victim\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\f            means that that one shot was fired less than\n            2 feet away.\n\n                   What does that mean? That means that\n            Reynaldo could not have been any further\n            away from the person who was holding that\n            gun to his head than that TV is to me right\n            now – less than 2 feet; less than 2 feet\n            away.    That is undisputed, unrebuttable\n            evidence.\n\n            Here, the use of the words “undisputed, unrebuttable\n\nevidence” hardly can be construed as a comment on defendant’s\n\nfailure to testify about these facts.\n\n            We proceed to the next statement:\n\n                   What else has been presented that is\n            unrebuttable, unrefuted testimony? Well, we\n            know that in May of 1996, Edgardo Quiros\n            Morales produced these two rifles right here\n            in a matter of minutes to a police officer\n            so he would do away with an arrest warrant\n            against him.\n\n            Again,   we    find   nothing      to   suggest   a   trespass   on\n\ndefendant’s right to remain silent in this statement.\n\n            The final statement is slightly more troubling:\n\n                   What was he going to do with the\n            cocaine and marijuana that was seized in\n            that apartment in 1992? That evidence came\n            before you unrebutted and unrefuted.\n\n            This statement conceivably could be construed as a\n\ncomment on the defendant’s failure to explain the circumstances\n\nof   the   drugs   being    in    his    apartment.     But    there   was   no\n\ncontemporaneous      objection,          and   we    have     held   in   such\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fcircumstances      that   ambiguous    statements         in   a    prosecutor's\n\nsummation    ordinarily     should    be    given   their      more    innocuous\n\nmeaning.    United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 307 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n            We need not decide whether this instruction involved\n\nplain error, because in all events, we think that any error was\n\nharmless.    Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n\ndefines harmless error as \"[a]ny error, defect, irregularity or\n\nvariance which does not affect substantial rights . . . .\"\n\nRule 52(b) provides that \"[p]lain errors or defects affecting\n\nsubstantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought\n\nto the attention of the court.\"               The Supreme Court held in\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993), that \"Rule 52(b)\n\nleaves the discretion to correct the forfeited error within the\n\nsound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should\n\nnot   exercise     that   discretion       unless   the    error      'seriously\n\naffect[s]    the   fairness,   integrity       or   public         reputation   of\n\njudicial proceedings.'\" Id. at 732 (quoting United States v.\n\nYoung, 470 U.S. 1, 15 (1985)).         Whether an error is prejudicial\n\nor harmless depends on whether it effects the outcome of the\n\ncase.    See id. at 734 (holding that the \"affecting substantial\n\nrights\" language of Rule 52(b) \"means that the error must have\n\nbeen prejudicial:         It must have affected the outcome of the\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fdistrict     court   proceedings\").     In   order   to    satisfy   the\n\n\"affecting substantial rights\" prong of Rule 52(b), a defendant\n\nmust normally make a specific showing of prejudice.           See id. at\n\n737.\n\n            The harmless error doctrine also applies to the final\n\nstatement made by the prosecutor in her argument.\n\n            I will tell you and leave you with this\n            thought. There is a dream in public housing\n            projects in Puerto Rico.   That there is a\n            tomorrow that we can make it better. That\n            is our dream, that is part of our promise,\n            and by “our” I mean those of us in Puerto\n            Rico.\n\n\n            D.    Whether or not the district court\n            committed reversible error in allowing\n            prosecutor   to  present  false   New  York\n            identifications of appellant in evidence,\n            which were obtained while appellant was\n            charged on unrelated state charges and were\n            distant in time from indictment object of\n            trial.\n\n            Ten days before being indicted, defendant was arrested\n\nin New York on charges unrelated to those in this case.              When\n\narrested,    defendant   possessed    several   false     identification\n\nitems.      These were introduced in evidence over defendant's\n\nobjections.\n\n            In her closing argument, the prosecutor characterized\n\ndefendant’s possession of false identification as “consciousness\n\nof guilt.”    The government points out that Acevedo Rodriguez, a\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\fmember of the enterprise with whom defendant had participated in\n\ndrug-related murders, was arrested in March, 1995.               Because of\n\nstatements Acevedo had made to another member of the conspiracy\n\ncharged in this case, defendant knew that Acevedo planned to be\n\na cooperating witness in this case.           Based on these premises,\n\nthe   government   contends       that   defendant   had   obtained    false\n\nidentification     so   as   to    avoid   prosecution     in   this   case.\n\nDefendant counters that he obtained the false identification as\n\nlong as seventeen months before he was indicted in this case,\n\nand that the false identification was discovered during the\n\nprosecution of an entirely different case.\n\n          We decline to decide this issue.               It is abundantly\n\nclear from the record that if it was error to admit the false\n\nidentification evidence, the error was harmless.                See Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 52(a).\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\f",

Nor do we recite, at this juncture, all of the facts involving  defendant.  Many of the facts pertaining to particular issues  will be set forth in our discussion of the issues.

Cooperating witnesses for the government included five former  members of the enterprise who sold narcotics for the  organization.  Their testimony can be summarized as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant and/or Vega-Figueroa delivered the drugs to  the various cooperating witnesses at the drug point, located in  a public housing project.  Members of the enterprise carjacked  automobiles on a regular basis.  The carjacked vehicles were  then used for drive-by shootings targeted against other drug  dealers who operated drug points in other public housing units  in competition with defendant and Vega-Figueroa.  The drug  distribution point of the enterprise was guarded by armed  members of the organization.  There was also testimony that  defendant and Vega-Figueroa operated a heroin drug point located  within the Hogar Crea detention and drug rehabilitation facility  in Saint Just at Trujuillo Alto, Puerto Rico.  Another drug gang  ousted two members of defendant's organization from the Hogar  Crea drug point.  Defendant and Vega-Figueroa ordered that the  two men who had taken over the Hogar Crea drug point be  murdered.  The men were ambushed and killed by defendant, Vega-Figueroa, and other members of defendant's enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment charged that the continuing criminal  enterprise and conspiracy started on or about August 1, 1990,  and continued until on or about April 10, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

You must unanimously agree on which  three violations constitute the series of  three or more violations in order to find  the essential element No. 2 of this offense  has been proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must also be proved that the  defendants engaged in the continuing series  of violations with at least five or more  persons, whether or not those persons are  named in the indictment and whether or not  the same five or more persons participated  in each of the violations, or participated  at different times.  And, it must be proved  that the defendant's relationship with the  other five or more persons was that of  organizers, supervisors or managers - that  the defendant's relationship with the other  five or more persons was that of organizer,  supervisor or manager, and that the  defendant was more than a fellow worker and  either organized or directed the activities  of the others, whether the defendant was the  only organizer or supervisor or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it must be proved that the  defendant obtained substantial income or  resources from the continuing series of  violations.

United States, 526 U.S. 813, 815  (1999), the Court, per Justice Breyer, held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal criminal statute forbids any  \"person\" from \"engag[ing] in a continuing  criminal enterprise.\" 84 Stat. 1264, 21  U.S.C. &#167; 848(a). It defines \"continuing  criminal enterprise\" (CCE) as involving a  \"violat[ion]\" of the drug statutes where  \"such violation is a part of a continuing  series of violations.\" &#167; 848(c).  We must  decide whether a jury has to agree  unanimously about which specific violations  make up the \"continuing series of  violations.\"  We hold that the jury must do  so. That is to say, a jury in a federal  criminal case brought under &#167; 848 must  unanimously agree not only that the  defendant committed some \"continuing series  of violations\" but also that the defendant  committed each of the individual  \"violations\" necessary to make up that  \"continuing series.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant acknowledges that the district court  instructed the jury that it had to unanimously agree as to the  three violations that constituted the series of violations.  He  contends, however, that the court erred because \"it failed to  identify which predicate offenses the continuing criminal  enterprise was based upon so as to permit the jury to determine  if it unanimously agreed upon said specific predicate offenses  which should have been specifically identified in the jury  instructions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We read nothing in Richardson requiring such action by  the district court.  If it had instructed the jury along the  lines defendant suggests, it would have usurped the function of  the jury.  Accordingly, we rule that the instruction met the Richardson requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.  Whether the district court committed  reversible error by allowing evidence of  drug trafficking at the Ramos Antonini  Housing Project during 1996 and 1997 and an  agent's interpretation of videotapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material allowed to be introduced as evidence over  defendant's objections included videotapes and photographs taken  at the drug point in the Ramos Antonini Housing Project.  The  evidence allegedly depicted narcotic sales taking place on the  following dates:  April 24, May 28, May 30, May 31, June 5, June  13, and June 15, 1996; and January 30, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also objected to the expert testimony of  Elias Negron, a member of the FBI's Safe Streets Task Force. Negron explained to the jury how the videotapes depicted drug  transactions.  Negron also gave his expert opinion that the  extended period of lack of violence at the drug point showed  that defendant and his cohorts had such secure control of the  drug point that no other drug gangs would attempt to take it  over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's objections to the videotape evidence are  based on relevancy and Federal Rule of Evidence 403.  The  relevancy contention is twofold:  (1) that the evidence did not  prove that the drug trafficking at the drug point in the housing  development in 1996 and 1997 related to defendant and the  conspiracy charged in the indictment; and (2) that both  defendant and Vega-Figueroa had been absent from the Ramos  Antonini Housing Project since 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a plethora of evidence, however, as to how  defendant and Vega-Figueroa operated and strictly controlled the  enterprise regardless of their occasional physical absence from  Puerto Rico.  William Acevedo Rodriguez, a trusted lieutenant in  the enterprise, testified as to the operation of the drug  points.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Alicia Gotay Saez testified that she and her sister ran  a drug point in the housing project in competition with the one  run by Vega-Figueroa and defendant.  Gotay described in detail  how a drug point is operated.  She also testified that after she  refused to join Vega-Figueroa's enterprise, her sister was shot  to death at his drug point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramon Caesareo Soto, who worked for a rival of the  criminal enterprise throughout the life of the conspiracy run by  Vega-Figueroa and defendant, described in detail the violence  and killings that had taken place in the Ramos Antonini Housing  Project between rival drug gangs for control of the drug trade  in the project in the years 1960 to 1963.  He testified that, by  1997, there was only one drug point in the project, which was  controlled by the enterprise run by Vega-Figueroa and defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence from which a jury could find beyond  a reasonable doubt that defendant was part of a criminal  enterprise and conspiracy devoted to selling illegal drugs that  started on or about August 1, 1990, and continued through March,  1997.  There was also evidence from which a jury could  reasonably find that the physical presence of defendant and/or  Vega-Figueroa at all times was not necessary to the daily  operation of the two drug points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence described above was not the only evidence  before the jury on drug trafficking under defendant's and Vega-Figueroa's auspices.  Our careful scrutiny of the record  convinces us that the jury verdict was based on evidence that  constituted proof beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt  as charged in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the objection based on the admission of  videotapes and photographs of the drug point in the public housing project and the admission of expert testimony to explain  the tapes and photographs.  Defendant argues that this evidence  should have been excluded because it violated Fed. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 403 provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of  Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of Time</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although relevant, evidence may be  excluded if its probative value is  substantially outweighed by the danger of  unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues,  or misleading the jury, or by considerations  of undue delay, waste of time, or needless  presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant objected to the introduction of the  videotapes and photos as highly prejudicial because they were  taken after he had left Puerto Rico, while he was in New York  State.  We point out that New York and Puerto Rico are only a  short plane ride apart and telephone communication is routine. We have already found that defendant's daily presence was not  necessary for the operation of the drug point.  There was no  violation of Fed. R. Evid. 403 by the introduction of the  videotapes and photos of the drug point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also claims that it was a violation of Rule  403 to allow an expert witness to explain to the jury what the  videotapes and photos depicted.  He argues that the testimony of  the expert was not necessary because the jury was capable of  understanding what was going on without expert help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appropriate test for reviewing the admission or  exclusion of expert testimony is abuse of discretion.  General  Elec. Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136, 139 (1997).  Elias Negron, a  member of the FBI's Safe Streets Task Force, provided his expert  opinion that the videotapes and photographs showed drug  transactions taking place.  He also proffered his opinion that  the extended non-violent period at the housing project showed  that defendant and Vega-Figueroa were in firm control of drug  trafficking at the project and that no other drug gangs  attempted to compete with the criminal enterprise and conspiracy  in which defendant played a major role.  It seems clear that  under the pertinent facts and the applicable law the district  court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the videotapes  and photos and allowing Elias Negron to testify as he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.  Whether or not prosecutor's closing  argument stating repeatedly that the  government's evidence had gone \"unrebutted\"  and \"unrefuted\" constituted improper comment  on the silence of defendants and transferred  burden of proof to defendants and improper  argument concerning \"dream\" of peaceful  residential projects warrants granting of  new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No objections were made by defendant to the statements  by the prosecutor during her argument.  This means that we  review for plain error.  See United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d  1161, 1187 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the prosecutor's words are placed in context, we  inquire whether \"the language used was manifestly intended or  was of such character that the jury would naturally and  necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the  accused to testify.\"  Id. at 1187 (quoting United States v. Glantz, 810 F.2d 316, 322 (1st Cir. 1987) (citations omitted)). We note that in his final charge, the judge instructed the jury  that the defendants had the right to remain silent and not  testify, and that their failure to testify could not be  considered as a factor in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our first task is to put the prosecutor's words in  context.  She began her argument by stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'd like to start by highlighting what  evidence we have presented to you that is  just simply, completely unprofitable [sic],  unrebuttable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What do we know is a fact, that  neither I nor any defense counsel that can  stand here before you can argue to the  contrary?  What has been so well-established  that it is simply undeniable?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . We know that on May 16th, 1994,  two people got killed at the Hogar Crea  located in Saint Just La Quinta in Carolina,  and that was Reinaldo Colon Gonzalez and  Melvin Flores Montalvo.  No doubt about  that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What else do we know about that event  that is completely unrefutable?  We know  that Daisy Serrano found 19 rifle casings at  the scene of these two murders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We know that Daisy Serrano found 18  .45-caliber casings at the scene of these  two murders.  They were there.  They've been  admitted here in court.  There is nothing  that any witness can say or that any person  can argue that these casings do not exist. Eighteen .45-caliber casings recovered from  the scene of these crimes.  Nineteen rifle  casings recovered from the scene of these  two murders.  They're here.  They exist. There's no doubt about that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thirty 9-millimeter casings recovered  at the scene of this crime.  Those are here  also.  These simply cannot go away; there's  just no going around that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems obvious that the prosecutor was not, even by  the broadest possible interpretation of the words \"unprofitable\"  and \"unrebuttable,\" commenting on defendant's failure to  testify.  What she stated were facts that were unrebuttable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next statement was made in the following context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also know that one of those  individuals was carrying this revolver,  because Mr. Maldonado told you that  projectiles recovered from the body of  Reynaldo and at least one projectile  recovered from the body of Melvin were fired  by this revolver right here (indicating). That's unrebuttable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where was this revolver found?  This  revolver was found in the house of Carlos  Hernandez Vega.  That evidence also went  unrebutted before you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agent who found this weapon, Edwin  Rodriguez, says, \"I found this weapon in the  house of Carlos Hernandez Vega,\" and Mr.  Maldonado says this was one of the revolvers  used during the commission of the murders at  Hogar Crea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The context is not complete, however, without the  following.  There was an objection by defense counsel:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS. DAVILA: She misstated the  evidence.  She said it was found in Carlos  Hernandez Vega's.  What the evidence said  was that the agent seized it from the floor  of the bottom of the residential project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MS.

It's unrefutable evidence.  It's  unrebuttable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acevedo was a former member of the enterprise and  conspiracy.  He was one of the chief witnesses for the  government.  His admission to murder is hardly the type of  statement that the jury would think that defendant would want to  answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The next statement in context was:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, what else, what other evidence has come  before you that is unrebuttable, undisputed? Well, we know that at least one wound  on Reynaldo Colon Gonzalez's body was fired  from a distance of less than 2 feet. Whoever fired the shot that made that tattoo  which Dr. Rosa Figueroa explained to you is  caused by gun powder particles which are  lodged on the skin when the gun is being  held at a close distance from the victim  means that that one shot was fired less than  2 feet away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What does that mean?  That means that  Reynaldo could not have been any further  away from the person who was holding that  gun to his head than that TV is to me right  now - less than 2 feet; less than 2 feet  away.  That is undisputed, unrebuttable  evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the use of the words \"undisputed, unrebuttable  evidence\" hardly can be construed as a comment on defendant's  failure to testify about these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We proceed to the next statement:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What else has been presented that is  unrebuttable, unrefuted testimony?  Well, we  know that in May of 1996, Edgardo Quiros  Morales produced these two rifles right here  in a matter of minutes to a police officer  so he would do away with an arrest warrant  against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, we find nothing to suggest a trespass on  defendant's right to remain silent in this statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final statement is slightly more troubling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What was he going to do with the  cocaine and marijuana that was seized in  that apartment in 1992?  That evidence came  before you unrebutted and unrefuted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statement conceivably could be construed as a  comment on the defendant's failure to explain the circumstances  of the drugs being in his apartment.  But there was no  contemporaneous objection, and we have held in such  circumstances that ambiguous statements in a prosecutor's  summation ordinarily should be given their more innocuous  meaning.  United States v. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 307 (1st Cir.  1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether this instruction involved  plain error, because in all events, we think that any error was  harmless.  Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure  defines harmless error as \"[a]ny error, defect, irregularity or  variance which does not affect substantial rights . . . .\" Rule 52(b) provides that \"[p]lain errors or defects affecting  substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought  to the attention of the court.\"  The Supreme Court held in United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725 (1993), that \"Rule 52(b)  leaves the discretion to correct the forfeited error within the  sound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should  not exercise that discretion unless the error 'seriously  affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of  judicial proceedings.'\" Id. at 732 (quoting United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 15 (1985)).  Whether an error is prejudicial  or harmless depends on whether it effects the outcome of the  case.  See id. at 734 (holding that the \"affecting substantial  rights\" language of Rule 52(b) \"means that the error must have  been prejudicial:  It must have affected the outcome of the  district court proceedings\").  In order to satisfy the  \"affecting substantial rights\" prong of Rule 52(b), a defendant  must normally make a specific showing of prejudice.  See id. at  737.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The harmless error doctrine also applies to the final  statement made by the prosecutor in her argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will tell you and leave you with this  thought.  There is a dream in public housing  projects in Puerto Rico.  That there is a  tomorrow that we can make it better.

Because of  statements Acevedo had made to another member of the conspiracy  charged in this case, defendant knew that Acevedo planned to be  a cooperating witness in this case.  Based on these premises,  the government contends that defendant had obtained false  identification so as to avoid prosecution in this case. Defendant counters that he obtained the false identification as  long as seventeen months before he was indicted in this case,  and that the false identification was discovered during the  prosecution of an entirely different case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to decide this issue.

FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to the  verdict.  See United States v.

This rehearsal of the evidence does not, of course,  cover the facts that are applicable only to other defendants. Nor do we recite, at this juncture, all of the facts involving  defendant.  Many of the facts pertaining to particular issues  will be set forth in our discussion of the issues.  All we do  now is state those facts that will give the reader the necessary  background information to understand the different issues raised  by defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant and Vega-Figueroa were in charge of an  extensive criminal enterprise involving the sale and  distribution of heroin, cocaine, crack cocaine, and marijuana. Cooperating witnesses for the government included five former  members of the enterprise who sold narcotics for the  organization.  Their testimony can be summarized as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant and/or Vega-Figueroa delivered the drugs to  the various cooperating witnesses at the drug point, located in  a public housing project.  Members of the enterprise carjacked  automobiles on a regular basis.  The carjacked vehicles were  then used for drive-by shootings targeted against other drug  dealers who operated drug points in other public housing units  in competition with defendant and Vega-Figueroa.  The drug  distribution point of the enterprise was guarded by armed  members of the organization.  There was also testimony that  defendant and Vega-Figueroa operated a heroin drug point located  within the Hogar Crea detention and drug rehabilitation facility  in Saint Just at Trujuillo Alto, Puerto Rico.  Another drug gang  ousted two members of defendant's organization from the Hogar  Crea drug point.  Defendant and Vega-Figueroa ordered that the  two men who had taken over the Hogar Crea drug point be  murdered.  The men were ambushed and killed by defendant, Vega-Figueroa, and other members of defendant's enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment charged that the continuing criminal  enterprise and conspiracy started on or about August 1, 1990,  and continued until on or about April 10, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

The law makes it  a federal crime or offense for anyone to  engage in what is called a continuing  criminal enterprise involving controlled  substances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant can be found guilty of that  offense only if all of the following facts  are proved beyond a reasonable doubt:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, that the defendants violated  Section 841(a)(1) as charged in the  indictment.  This is the drug trafficking  case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, that such violations were a  part of a continuing series of violations as  herein after defined.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, that such continuing series of  violations were undertaken by the defendants  in concert or together with at least five or  more other persons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, that the defendant occupied  the position of an organizer, supervisor or  manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth, that the defendant obtained  substantial income or resources in the  continuing series of violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A continuing series of violation means  proof of at least three violations under the  Federal controlled substances law, as  charged in Count I of the indictment, and  also requires a finding that those  violations were connected together as a  series of related or ongoing activities as  distinguished from isolated and disconnected  acts.  You must unanimously agree on which  three violations constitute the series of  three or more violations in order to find  the essential element No. 2 of this offense  has been proven.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It must also be proved that the  defendants engaged in the continuing series  of violations with at least five or more  persons, whether or not those persons are  named in the indictment and whether or not  the same five or more persons participated  in each of the violations, or participated  at different times.  And, it must be proved  that the defendant's relationship with the  other five or more persons was that of  organizers, supervisors or managers - that  the defendant's relationship with the other  five or more persons was that of organizer,  supervisor or manager, and that the  defendant was more than a fellow worker and  either organized or directed the activities  of the others, whether the defendant was the  only organizer or supervisor or not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it must be proved that the  defendant obtained substantial income or  resources from the continuing series of  violations.  This means that the defendant's  income from violations, in money or other  property, must have been significant in size  or amount as distinguished from relatively  insubstantial, insignificant or trivial  amount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Richardson v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span>, 815  (1999), the Court, per Justice Breyer, held:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal criminal statute forbids any  \"person\" from \"engag[ing] in a continuing  criminal enterprise.\" 84 Stat. 1264, 21  U.S.C. &#167; 848(a). It defines \"continuing  criminal enterprise\" (CCE) as involving a  \"violat[ion]\" of the drug statutes where  \"such violation is a part of a continuing  series of violations.\" &#167; 848(c).  We must  decide whether a jury has to agree  unanimously about which specific violations  make up the \"continuing series of  violations.\"  We hold that the jury must do  so. That is to say, a jury in a federal  criminal case brought under &#167; 848 must  unanimously agree not only that the  defendant committed some \"continuing series  of violations\" but also that the defendant  committed each of the individual  \"violations\" necessary to make up that  \"continuing series.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant acknowledges that the district court  instructed the jury that it had to unanimously agree as to the  three violations that constituted the series of violations.  He  contends, however, that the court erred because \"it failed to  identify which predicate offenses the continuing criminal  enterprise was based upon so as to permit the jury to determine  if it unanimously agreed upon said specific predicate offenses  which should have been specifically identified in the jury  instructions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We read nothing in Richardson requiring such action by  the district court.  If it had instructed the jury along the  lines defendant suggests, it would have usurped the function of  the jury.  Accordingly, we rule that the instruction met the Richardson requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.  Whether the district court committed  reversible error by allowing evidence of  drug trafficking at the Ramos Antonini  Housing Project during 1996 and 1997 and an  agent's interpretation of videotapes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The material allowed to be introduced as evidence over  defendant's objections included videotapes and photographs taken  at the drug point in the Ramos Antonini Housing Project.  The  evidence allegedly depicted narcotic sales taking place on the  following dates:  April 24, May 28, May 30, May 31, June 5, June  13, and June 15, 1996; and January 30, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also objected to the expert testimony of  Elias Negron, a member of the FBI's Safe Streets Task Force. Negron explained to the jury how the videotapes depicted drug  transactions.  Negron also gave his expert opinion that the  extended period of lack of violence at the drug point showed  that defendant and his cohorts had such secure control of the  drug point that no other drug gangs would attempt to take it  over.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's objections to the videotape evidence are  based on relevancy and Federal Rule of Evidence 403.  The  relevancy contention is twofold:  (1) that the evidence did not  prove that the drug trafficking at the drug point in the housing  development in 1996 and 1997 related to defendant and the  conspiracy charged in the indictment; and (2) that both  defendant and Vega-Figueroa had been absent from the Ramos  Antonini Housing Project since 1995.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was a plethora of evidence, however, as to how  defendant and Vega-Figueroa operated and strictly controlled the  enterprise regardless of their occasional physical absence from  Puerto Rico.  William Acevedo Rodriguez, a trusted lieutenant in  the enterprise, testified as to the operation of the drug  points.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Alicia Gotay Saez testified that she and her sister ran  a drug point in the housing project in competition with the one  run by Vega-Figueroa and defendant.  Gotay described in detail  how a drug point is operated.  She also testified that after she  refused to join Vega-Figueroa's enterprise, her sister was shot  to death at his drug point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ramon Caesareo Soto, who worked for a rival of the  criminal enterprise throughout the life of the conspiracy run by  Vega-Figueroa and defendant, described in detail the violence  and killings that had taken place in the Ramos Antonini Housing  Project between rival drug gangs for control of the drug trade  in the project in the years 1960 to 1963.  He testified that, by  1997, there was only one drug point in the project, which was  controlled by the enterprise run by Vega-Figueroa and defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was evidence from which a jury could find beyond  a reasonable doubt that defendant was part of a criminal  enterprise and conspiracy devoted to selling illegal drugs that  started on or about August 1, 1990, and continued through March,  1997.  There was also evidence from which a jury could  reasonably find that the physical presence of defendant and/or  Vega-Figueroa at all times was not necessary to the daily  operation of the two drug points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence described above was not the only evidence  before the jury on drug trafficking under defendant's and Vega-Figueroa's auspices.  Our careful scrutiny of the record  convinces us that the jury verdict was based on evidence that  constituted proof beyond a reasonable doubt of defendant's guilt  as charged in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the objection based on the admission of  videotapes and photographs of the drug point in the public housing project and the admission of expert testimony to explain  the tapes and photographs.  Defendant argues that this evidence  should have been excluded because it violated Fed. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Rule 403 provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Exclusion of Relevant Evidence on Grounds of  Prejudice, Confusion, or Waste of Time</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although relevant, evidence may be  excluded if its probative value is  substantially outweighed by the danger of  unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues,  or misleading the jury, or by considerations  of undue delay, waste of time, or needless  presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant objected to the introduction of the  videotapes and photos as highly prejudicial because they were  taken after he had left Puerto Rico, while he was in New York  State.  We point out that New York and Puerto Rico are only a  short plane ride apart and telephone communication is routine. We have already found that defendant's daily presence was not  necessary for the operation of the drug point.  There was no  violation of Fed. R. Evid. 403 by the introduction of the  videotapes and photos of the drug point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also claims that it was a violation of Rule  403 to allow an expert witness to explain to the jury what the  videotapes and photos depicted.  He argues that the testimony of  the expert was not necessary because the jury was capable of  understanding what was going on without expert help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appropriate test for reviewing the admission or  exclusion of expert testimony is abuse of discretion.  General  Elec. Co. v. Joiner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118157\"><a href=\"/opinion/118157/general-electric-co-v-joiner/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 139 (1997).  Elias Negron, a  member of the FBI's Safe Streets Task Force, provided his expert  opinion that the videotapes and photographs showed drug  transactions taking place.  He also proffered his opinion that  the extended non-violent period at the housing project showed  that defendant and Vega-Figueroa were in firm control of drug  trafficking at the project and that no other drug gangs  attempted to compete with the criminal enterprise and conspiracy  in which defendant played a major role.  It seems clear that  under the pertinent facts and the applicable law the district  court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the videotapes  and photos and allowing Elias Negron to testify as he did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.  Whether or not prosecutor's closing  argument stating repeatedly that the  government's evidence had gone \"unrebutted\"  and \"unrefuted\" constituted improper comment  on the silence of defendants and transferred  burden of proof to defendants and improper  argument concerning \"dream\" of peaceful  residential projects warrants granting of  new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No objections were made by defendant to the statements  by the prosecutor during her argument.  This means that we  review for plain error.  See United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1187 (1st Cir. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the prosecutor's words are placed in context, we  inquire whether \"the language used was manifestly intended or  was of such character that the jury would naturally and  necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the  accused to testify.\"  Id. at 1187 (quoting United States v.

We note that in his final charge, the judge instructed the jury  that the defendants had the right to remain silent and not  testify, and that their failure to testify could not be  considered as a factor in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our first task is to put the prosecutor's words in  context.

They were there.  They've been  admitted here in court.  There is nothing  that any witness can say or that any person  can argue that these casings do not exist. Eighteen .45-caliber casings recovered from  the scene of these crimes.  Nineteen rifle  casings recovered from the scene of these  two murders.  They're here.  They exist.

What she stated were facts that were unrebuttable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next statement was made in the following context.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also know that one of those  individuals was carrying this revolver,  because Mr. Maldonado told you that  projectiles recovered from the body of  Reynaldo and at least one projectile  recovered from the body of Melvin were fired  by this revolver right here (indicating).

He was one of the chief witnesses for the  government.  His admission to murder is hardly the type of  statement that the jury would think that defendant would want to  answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The next statement in context was:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, what else, what other evidence has come  before you that is unrebuttable, undisputed? Well, we know that at least one wound  on Reynaldo Colon Gonzalez's body was fired  from a distance of less than 2 feet. Whoever fired the shot that made that tattoo  which Dr. Rosa Figueroa explained to you is  caused by gun powder particles which are  lodged on the skin when the gun is being  held at a close distance from the victim  means that that one shot was fired less than  2 feet away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What does that mean?  That means that  Reynaldo could not have been any further  away from the person who was holding that  gun to his head than that TV is to me right  now - less than 2 feet; less than 2 feet  away.  That is undisputed, unrebuttable  evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the use of the words \"undisputed, unrebuttable  evidence\" hardly can be construed as a comment on defendant's  failure to testify about these facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">We proceed to the next statement:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What else has been presented that is  unrebuttable, unrefuted testimony?  Well, we  know that in May of 1996, Edgardo Quiros  Morales produced these two rifles right here  in a matter of minutes to a police officer  so he would do away with an arrest warrant  against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, we find nothing to suggest a trespass on  defendant's right to remain silent in this statement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final statement is slightly more troubling:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What was he going to do with the  cocaine and marijuana that was seized in  that apartment in 1992?  That evidence came  before you unrebutted and unrefuted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This statement conceivably could be construed as a  comment on the defendant's failure to explain the circumstances  of the drugs being in his apartment.  But there was no  contemporaneous objection, and we have held in such  circumstances that ambiguous statements in a prosecutor's  summation ordinarily should be given their more innocuous  meaning.  United States v. Lilly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597801\"><a href=\"/opinion/597801/united-states-v-william-w-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 307 (1st Cir.  1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether this instruction involved  plain error, because in all events, we think that any error was  harmless.  Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure  defines harmless error as \"[a]ny error, defect, irregularity or  variance which does not affect substantial rights . . . .\" Rule 52(b) provides that \"[p]lain errors or defects affecting  substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought  to the attention of the court.\"  The Supreme Court held in United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span> (1993), that \"Rule 52(b)  leaves the discretion to correct the forfeited error within the  sound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should  not exercise that discretion unless the error 'seriously  affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of  judicial proceedings.'\" Id. at 732 (quoting United States v. Young, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111353\"><a href=\"/opinion/111353/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 15 (1985)).  Whether an error is prejudicial  or harmless depends on whether it effects the outcome of the  case.  See id. at 734 (holding that the \"affecting substantial  rights\" language of Rule 52(b) \"means that the error must have  been prejudicial:  It must have affected the outcome of the  district court proceedings\").  In order to satisfy the  \"affecting substantial rights\" prong of Rule 52(b), a defendant  must normally make a specific showing of prejudice.  See id. at  737.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The harmless error doctrine also applies to the final  statement made by the prosecutor in her argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I will tell you and leave you with this  thought.  There is a dream in public housing  projects in Puerto Rico.  That there is a  tomorrow that we can make it better.  That  is our dream, that is part of our promise,  and by  \"our\" I mean those of us in Puerto  Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D.  Whether or not the district court  committed reversible error in allowing  prosecutor to present false New York  identifications of appellant in evidence,  which were obtained while appellant was  charged on unrelated state charges and were  distant in time from indictment object of  trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ten days before being indicted, defendant was arrested  in New York on charges unrelated to those in this case.  When  arrested, defendant possessed several false identification  items.  These were introduced in evidence over defendant's  objections.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her closing argument, the prosecutor characterized  defendant's possession of false identification as \"consciousness  of guilt.\"  The government points out that Acevedo Rodriguez, a  member of the enterprise with whom defendant had participated in  drug-related murders, was arrested in March, 1995.  Because of  statements Acevedo had made to another member of the conspiracy  charged in this case, defendant knew that Acevedo planned to be  a cooperating witness in this case.  Based on these premises,  the government contends that defendant had obtained false  identification so as to avoid prosecution in this case. Defendant counters that he obtained the false identification as  long as seventeen months before he was indicted in this case,  and that the false identification was discovered during the  prosecution of an entirely different case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to decide this issue.  It is abundantly  clear from the record that if it was error to admit the false  identification evidence, the error was harmless.  See Fed. R.  Crim. P. 52(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Count II was subsequently dismissed.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The first issue raised by defendant is that he received  life sentences under both Counts I and Count II, thus violating  principles of double jeopardy.  As Count II has been dismissed,  leaving only one life sentence, this point needs no discussion.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> After Acevedo was arrested in March of 1995, he decided to  become a cooperating witness.  He was afraid that if he was  incarcerated in the main prison at Guayama, he would be killed  by other inmates because he had participated in the killing of  friends of theirs.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
