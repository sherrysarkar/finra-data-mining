Upon  careful  review of  the  briefs and\r                            \r\n\nrecord,  it appears that no substantial question is presented\r\n\nin this appeal and that summary disposition is appropriate.\r\n\n     Defendant  first argues  that,  in selecting  a sentence\r\n\nwithin  the guideline range,  the district court  should have\r\n\ngiven fuller consideration to defendant's alleged cooperation\r\n\nwith the government.  We may not review that argument because\r\n\nwe have no  jurisdiction to consider an  appeal from sentence\r\n\nthat  was within  the  applicable  guideline  range  and  was\r\n\ncorrectly  determined.
