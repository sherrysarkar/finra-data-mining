Sanchez Ramos, Solicitor General, and Vanessa Lugo\nFlores and Sylvia Roger-Stefani, Deputy Solicitors General, on brief\nfor appellees Rodriguez and Martinez in their personal capacities.\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f                            October 30, 2001\n\n            Per   Curiam.    Hector       Serra-Lugo    appeals   from   the\n\ndismissal    of   his   civil     rights     suit,     claiming   political\n\ndiscrimination and harassment, brought against the municipality\n\nof Mayaguez and certain municipal employees.               The action was\n\nfiled on April 14, 2000.        The district court issued an order on\n\nJuly 20, 2000 which scheduled the initial scheduling conference\n\nand required the filing of a memorandum.             That order warned the\n\nparties that the failure to comply with the terms of the order\n\ncould result in the imposition of sanctions, including but not\n\nlimited to, the dismissal of the complaint.                   Nonetheless,\n\nplaintiff failed to comply with that order in a timely fashion.\n\nIn addition, plaintiff's counsel was absent from the initial\n\nscheduling conference, although he was aware his attendance was\n\nrequired. The trial judge then imposed sanctions on plaintiff’s\n\ncounsel for his failure to appear and file a timely memorandum.\n\nHowever, that did not end the plaintiff’s failure to comply with\n\ncourt orders.     Plaintiff was late in answering interrogatories,\n\nfailed to do the deposition work within the time frames set by\n\nthe court, failed to file a joint status report, and failed to\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fproduce documents requested through discovery in a timely\n\nfashion.\n\n           Not surprisingly, the district court dismissed the\n\ncomplaint with prejudice under Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(b)(2)(C) and\n\nLocal Rule 314.4 of the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico.\n\n           We review such dismissals for abuse of discretion.\n\nNational Hockey League v. Metropolitan Hockey Club, Inc., 427\n\nU.S. 639, 642 (1976) (per curiam).               While dismissal with\n\nprejudice is a drastic sanction, it is one that is available to\n\nthe district courts.    Id. at 643.     Plaintiff says that at most\n\nhe is guilty of complying with the court’s order in \"a somewhat\n\nrelaxed manner\" and that a lesser penalty should have sufficed.\n\nPlaintiff also argues that because the court earlier accepted\n\nhis   counsel’s   apology   for   failure   to    attend   the   initial\n\nscheduling conference, that failure should be excused. Finally,\n\nplaintiff says that the defendants did not specifically request\n\nthe dismissal of the case.\n\n           The district court was well within its discretion in\n\ndismissing the case after repeated violations of its orders and\n\nafter having warned plaintiff of the consequences of non-\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcompliance.     The    court   has    its   own   interest   in   securing\n\ncompliance with its orders. Counsel who choose to disregard the\n\norders of the district court place themselves and their clients\n\nat risk.   There was no abuse of discretion here.            The patience\n\nof the district court had been exhausted, for good reason.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f",
