This appeal presents a\r\njurisdictional tangle.  The seeds for the underlying litigation\r\nwere sown when the late Howard Phillips (Phillips or the testator)\r\nbequeathed all the stock in a profitable Florida-based real estate\r\ndevelopment company, Dr. Phillips, Inc. (the Company), to the\r\nHoward Phillips Fund (the Fund), upon the condition that the Fund\r\nshare the profits with Phillips Exeter Academy (Exeter), a private\r\nsecondary school located in New Hampshire.  Over time, Exeter\r\nconcluded that the Company and the Fund had short-shrifted it. \r\nWhen a disenchanted Exeter subsequently sued in New Hampshire's\r\nfederal district court, the court determined that it lacked\r\npersonal jurisdiction over the named defendants and dismissed the\r\naction.  Exeter appeals.  We affirm.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nPhillips resided in Florida and executed his will there. \r\nWhen he died in 1979, he held a power of appointment over all the\r\nshares in the Company.  His will directed that the stock be offered\r\nin turn to a series of family-sponsored charitable foundations. \r\nAfter one declined the gift, the Fund accepted it.\r\nThe testator was an alumnus of Exeter and a stalwart\r\nsupporter of his alma mater.  His will obligated the Fund, as a\r\ncondition to its receipt of the Company's stock, to vote the stock\r\nfor the election of an Exeter representative to the Company's\r\ngoverning board and to pay Exeter \"Five (5%) percent of the net\r\nincome from such stock . . . but not for more than twenty (20)\r\nyears after [Phillips's] death,\" along with \"Five (5%) percent of\r\nthe net proceeds of the stock\" if and when sold within the 20-year\r\nwindow.  Phillips's will further provided that \"any right to future\r\nincome shall cease\" upon a sale of the stock.  Although these were\r\nthe only firm conditions attached to the bequest, the testator\r\nexpressed his hope that the recipient of the stock would continue\r\nto focus its charitable efforts on the causes and institutions it\r\nhad favored when he was active in its direction and that it would\r\ngive Exeter 5% of its own net income annually for 20 years.  The\r\nFund, as a matter of practice, apparently fulfilled the first of\r\nthese velleities, continuing to devote most of its resources to\r\nfamiliar Florida charities (including Florida chapters of national\r\norganizations).  But for aught that appears, the Fund showed no\r\ninterest in channeling more money to Exeter.\r\nSoon after the Florida probate proceedings were\r\ncompleted, two things happened.  First, the Fund, acting at\r\nExeter's behest, elected John Emery   an Exeter alumnus who lives\r\nand works in New York   to the Company's board.  Second, H.E.\r\nJohnson, who then served as the chief executive officer of both the\r\nFund and the Company   the two entities were under common control,\r\nand remained so thereafter   consulted Emery about the possibility\r\nof a lump-sum commutation of the Fund's present and future\r\nobligations to Exeter.  Exeter turned a deaf ear to this entreaty,\r\nand the Fund proceeded to send checks annually to Exeter in New\r\nHampshire, each equaling 5% of the dividend declared by the Company\r\nfor the year in question.\r\nAnother settlement overture occurred in 1992, when\r\nJohnson's successor, James Hinson, visited the school's headmaster\r\nin New Hampshire.  This visit   which marked the only time that an\r\nofficial of either defendant set foot in New Hampshire to conduct\r\nExeter-related business   proved unavailing.  The next year, Hinson\r\nagain unsuccessfully proposed a settlement, this time by letter.\r\nThe Fund and the Company both altered their corporate\r\nforms in the years following the testator's demise.  In 1980, the\r\nFund converted from a private family foundation (known as the Della\r\nPhillips Foundation) to its present incarnation as a charitable\r\nsupport organization (known as the Howard Phillips Fund).  This\r\nmaneuver enabled it to hold the Company's stock indefinitely,\r\nwithout risk of escalating tax penalties.  Compare 26 U.S.C.  4943\r\n(describing tax consequences for private foundations with \"excess\r\nbusiness holdings\"), with id.  509(a)(3) (excluding charitable\r\nsupport organizations from the definition of \"private foundation\"). \r\nIn 1997, management merged the Company, until then an ordinary\r\nbusiness corporation, into a newly established Delaware nonprofit\r\ncorporation of the same name, with the result that the Fund became\r\nthe sole member of the Company rather than its sole stockholder. \r\nDespite the conversion of its stock interest to a membership\r\ninterest, the Fund made no contemporaneous payment to Exeter.\r\nExeter received its next annual check   an unusually\r\nlarge one, geared to the Company's net income, rather than to its\r\nannual dividend   from the Company instead of the Fund.  Shortly\r\nthereafter, Exeter filed suit, claiming that the Fund and the\r\nCompany were liable in both tort and contract because (1) the \r\ntransmitted payments, computed by the Fund on the basis of 5% of\r\nthe Company's annual dividends, fell well short of the Fund's\r\nobligation to pay Exeter 5% of the Company's annual income; (2) the\r\nrestructuring that had occurred was designed to thwart the\r\ntestator's intention that the Fund sell the stock within 20 years\r\nand deliver 5% of the net sale proceeds to Exeter; and (3) in all\r\nevents, when the Fund exchanged its stock ownership for a\r\nmembership interest, it should have paid Exeter 5% of the Company's\r\nvalue.  The district court did not address the substance of these\r\nallegations but, rather, granted the Fund's and the Company's joint\r\nmotion to dismiss the action for want of personal jurisdiction. \r\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).  This appeal ensued.\r\nII.  ANALYSIS\r\nNew Hampshire's long-arm statute reaches to the full\r\nextent that the Constitution allows.  See Phelps v. Kingston, 536\r\nA.2d 740, 742 (N.H. 1987); Computac v. Dixie News Co., 469 A.2d\r\n1345, 1348 (N.H. 1983).  Aware of this reality, the court below\r\nsensibly focused on federal constitutional standards, and the\r\nparties   who agree on little else   have briefed the appeal in\r\nthose terms.  Thus, we proceed directly to the constitutional\r\ninquiry.\r\nThe Due Process Clause prohibits a court from imposing\r\nits will on persons whose actions do not place them in a position\r\nwhere they reasonably can foresee that they might be called to\r\naccount in that jurisdiction.  See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.\r\nWoodson, 444 U.S. 286, 297 (1980).  Although this regime is\r\ngrounded in principles of fundamental fairness, it is written more\r\nin shades of grey than in black and white.  See Burger King Corp.\r\nv. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 486 n.29 (1985); United Elec., Radio &amp;\r\nMach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., 960 F.2d 1080, 1088 (1st\r\nCir. 1992).\r\nThe accepted mode of analysis for questions involving\r\npersonal jurisdiction concentrates on the quality and quantity of\r\nthe potential defendant's contacts with the forum.  See\r\nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945). \r\nThus, a defendant who has maintained a continuous and systematic\r\nlinkage with the forum state brings himself within the general\r\njurisdiction of that state's courts in respect to all matters, even\r\nthose that are unrelated to the defendant's contacts with the\r\nforum.  See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, 466\r\nU.S. 408, 414 (1984); Donatelli v. National Hockey League, 893 F.2d\r\n459, 462-63 (1st Cir. 1990).  Short of general jurisdiction, a\r\ncourt still may hear a particular case if that case relates\r\nsufficiently to, or arises from, a significant subset of contacts\r\nbetween the defendant and the forum.  See Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at\r\n414; Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 462-63.  Exeter has never claimed that\r\nthe Fund and the Company are subject to the general jurisdiction of\r\nNew Hampshire's courts.  Hence, it is the latter type of personal\r\njurisdiction   commonly called \"specific jurisdiction\"   that is at\r\nissue here.\r\nThe inquiry into specific jurisdiction lends itself to a\r\ntripartite analysis.  See Massachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover,\r\nInc. v. American Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 35 (1st Cir. 1998);\r\nTicketmaster-N.Y., Inc. v. Alioto, 26 F.3d 201, 206 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  First, an inquiring court must ask whether the claim that\r\nundergirds the litigation directly relates to or arises out of the\r\ndefendant's contacts with the forum.  Second, the court must ask\r\nwhether those contacts constitute purposeful availment of the\r\nbenefits and protections afforded by the forum's laws.  Third, if\r\nthe proponent's case clears the first two hurdles, the court then\r\nmust analyze the overall reasonableness of an exercise of\r\njurisdiction in light of a variety of pertinent factors that touch\r\nupon the fundamental fairness of an exercise of jurisdiction.  See\r\nUnited Elec. Workers, 960 F.2d at 1088 (discussing this aspect of\r\nthe inquiry and dubbing these factors the \"Gestalt factors\").  An\r\naffirmative finding on each of the three elements of the test is\r\nrequired to support a finding of specific jurisdiction.\r\nThe district court went no further than the first tier of\r\nthe test in ruling that neither defendant was subject to its\r\njurisdiction.  Concluding, on largely undisputed facts, that the\r\ncauses of action that Exeter pleaded did not arise out of or relate\r\nsufficiently to the defendants' contacts with New Hampshire, the\r\ncourt decided that Exeter had failed to make a prima facie showing\r\nadequate to justify an exercise of specific jurisdiction.  We\r\nreview this decision de novo, see Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp;\r\nWilcox Can., 46 F.3d 138, 147 (1st Cir. 1995), mindful that we are\r\nnot wedded to the lower court's reasoning, but may affirm the\r\njudgment for any independent reason made manifest in the record,\r\nsee Hachikian v. FDIC, 96 F.3d 502, 504 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nThe district court made a painstakingly thoughtful\r\nanalysis.  Its methodology was to compile a list of the Fund's\r\nactivities in New Hampshire   transmitting checks into the state\r\nonce a year, sending a few letters to Exeter, and visiting Exeter\r\non one occasion in an effort to forge a settlement   and then to\r\nexplore the interrelationship between Exeter's claims and these\r\ncontacts.  The court made this exploration on a claim-by-claim\r\nbasis.  As to the contract claim, the court noted that the relevant\r\ncontract had been created in Florida (when the Fund accepted the\r\nconditional bequest) and that, if the contract was breached, the\r\nbreach also occurred in Florida (where the Fund decided what\r\namounts would be disbursed to Exeter).  Turning to the tort claim,\r\nthe court could discern no causal connection between the Fund's New\r\nHampshire contacts and either the alleged breach of fiduciary duty\r\nor the injury resulting therefrom.  Consequently, the court held\r\nthat none of Exeter's claims was sufficiently related to the Fund's\r\ncontacts with New Hampshire to warrant the exercise of personal\r\njurisdiction.\r\nWe commend the lower court's decision to analyze the\r\ncontract and tort claims discretely.  Questions of specific\r\njurisdiction are always tied to the particular claims asserted. \r\nSee United Elec. Workers, 960 F.2d at 1089 (stating that \"the\r\ndefendant's in-state conduct must form an 'important, or [at least]\r\nmaterial, element of proof' in the plaintiff's case\") (quoting\r\nMarino v. Hyatt Corp., 793 F.2d 427, 430 (1st Cir. 1986)).  In\r\ncontract cases, a court charged with determining the existence vel\r\nnon of personal jurisdiction must look to the elements of the cause\r\nof action and ask whether the defendant's contacts with the forum\r\nwere instrumental either in the formation of the contract or in its\r\nbreach.  See, e.g., id. at 1089-90; Jones v. Petty-Ray Geophysical,\r\nGeosource, Inc., 954 F.2d 1061, 1068 (5th Cir. 1992); Papachristou\r\nv. Turbines Inc., 902 F.2d 685, 686 (8th Cir. 1990) (en banc). \r\nBecause the elements differ in a tort case, a court charged with\r\ndetermining the existence vel non of personal jurisdiction must\r\nprobe the causal nexus between the defendant's contacts and the\r\nplaintiff's cause of action.  See Nowak v. Tak How Invs., Ltd., 94\r\nF.3d 708, 715-16 (1st Cir. 1996); Sawtelle v. Farrell, 70 F.3d\r\n1381, 1390 (1st Cir. 1995).  Thus, the court below appropriately\r\ndrew a distinction between Exeter's contract and tort claims.  See\r\nMass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 35.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we turn to Exeter's contentions\r\nthat the district court conflated the relatedness and purposeful\r\navailment inquiries, and failed to recognize that, in gauging\r\nrelatedness, a defendant's contacts with the forum state are not\r\nnecessarily limited to moments of physical presence.  In Exeter's\r\nview, the Fund's ongoing relationship with, and obligations to, a\r\nNew Hampshire beneficiary comprise contacts that satisfy the\r\nrelatedness requirement.\r\nTo be sure, there is a natural blurring of the\r\nrelatedness and purposeful availment inquiries in cases (like this\r\none) in which the alleged contacts are less tangible than physical\r\npresence; in such circumstances, an inquiring court must determine\r\nthe extent to which the defendant directed an out-of-state activity\r\nat the forum state in order to ascertain whether the activity can\r\nbe termed a contact at all.  See, e.g., id. at 36.  This\r\ndetermination bears at least a family resemblance to a\r\ndetermination of whether a defendant purposefully availed himself\r\nof the protections of the forum state.  Notwithstanding this\r\nresemblance, however, the inquiries are different, see James Wm.\r\nMoore, Moore's Federal Practice  108.42[2][a] (3d ed. 1999), and\r\nwe reject Exeter's contention that the district court confused\r\nthem.\r\nExeter's principal argument along this line is that the\r\nfiduciary relationship between the parties should itself have been\r\nevaluated as a New Hampshire contact related to Exeter's claims. \r\nWe agree with one premise that underlies this argument:  to be\r\nconstitutionally significant, forum-state contacts need not involve\r\nphysical presence.  See Burger King, 471 U.S. at 476.  We disagree,\r\nhowever, with Exeter's attempt to invoke this premise here.  It is\r\nnot the relationship itself, but the content of the parties'\r\ninteractions that creates constitutionally significant contacts. \r\nThus, \"[t]he relatedness requirement is not met merely because a\r\nplaintiff's cause of action arose out of the general relationship\r\nbetween the parties; rather, the action must directly arise out of\r\nthe specific contacts between the defendant and the forum state.\" \r\nSawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1389.  The district court adhered to this rule\r\nand correctly focused on the forum-based activities surrounding the\r\nFund's relationship with Exeter   without regard to whether they\r\nentailed physical presence   rather than on the relationship\r\nitself.\r\nExeter's claim that this approach ignores the teachings\r\nof Burger King lacks force.  As Exeter points out, Burger King\r\nupheld the Florida courts' exercise of jurisdiction over a Michigan\r\nfranchisee of a Florida corporation in part because of the parties'\r\n\"carefully structured 20-year relationship that envisioned\r\ncontinuing and wide-reaching [Florida] contacts.\"  471 U.S. at 480. \r\nBut this snippet does not paint the whole picture:  the Burger King\r\nCourt made clear that the mere existence of a contractual\r\nrelationship between an out-of-state defendant and an in-state\r\nplaintiff does not suffice, in and of itself, to establish\r\njurisdiction in the plaintiff's home state.  See id. at 478-79. \r\nRather, \"prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences,\r\nalong with the terms of the contract and the parties' actual course\r\nof dealing . . . must be evaluated in determining whether the\r\ndefendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the\r\nforum.\"  Id. at 479.  The district court's approach was faithful to\r\nthis instruction.\r\nWe next proceed to the court's implementation of the\r\napproach.  As we have indicated, the relevant interactions between\r\nthe parties and the proposed forum must be assayed in light of the\r\nnature of the plaintiff's claim.  See United Elec. Workers, 960\r\nF.2d at 1089.  For example, in  Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235\r\n(1958), the settlor had executed a trust indenture in Delaware,\r\nnaming a Delaware trustee who administered the trust corpus in that\r\nstate.  See id. at 238.  The settlor later moved to Florida, but\r\ncontinued to receive payments from the trust.  See id. at 252.  She\r\nalso purported to exercise a power of appointment reserved in the\r\ntrust indenture.  See id. at 239.  Upon her death, certain legatees\r\nsued the trustee in a Florida court, seeking to declare the\r\nreservation invalid.  See id. at 240-42.  Because the plaintiffs'\r\nclaim focused on the validity vel non of the Delaware trust and the\r\npower-of-appointment provision, the Court held that the claim did\r\nnot arise out of in-forum contacts even though the power of\r\nappointment had been exercised in Florida by a Florida resident who\r\nhad been receiving regular payments there from the trustee.  See\r\nid. at 251-52.  At the same time, however, the Court left open the\r\npossibility that a different claim   one focused on the propriety\r\nof the exercise of the power of appointment   might give rise to\r\njurisdiction over the trustee in Florida.  See id. at 253 &amp; n.25.\r\nHanson suggests that we must determine the focal point of\r\neach of the plaintiff's claims and assess the interactions between\r\nthe defendant and the forum state through that prism.  Here,\r\nhowever, regardless of whether this dispute is viewed as a breach\r\nof contract case or a breach of fiduciary duty case, the same two\r\nlandmarks predominate:  the meaning of the testator's will and the\r\nFund's fulfillment of the obligations that it undertook coincident\r\nto its acceptance of the bequest.  Most of the relevant\r\ninteractions (e.g., the execution of the will, the acceptance of\r\nthe bequest, and the payment decisions) occurred in Florida.  The\r\nrest (e.g., the restructuring of the Company and the conversion of\r\nthe Fund's ownership interest to a membership interest) occurred in\r\nDelaware.  From this vantage point, Exeter's claim to jurisdiction\r\nin New Hampshire appears untenable.  See Bond Leather Co. v. Q.T.\r\nShoe Mfg. Co., 764 F.2d 928, 934 (1st Cir. 1985).\r\nExeter has another string to its jurisdictional bow. \r\nNotwithstanding that the formation of the relationship had nothing\r\nto do with New Hampshire, it asseverates that the consequences of\r\nthe relationship involved contacts with New Hampshire sufficient to\r\nsubject the Fund to the jurisdiction of the New Hampshire courts. \r\nSee Burger King, 471 U.S. at 479.  Because the payments transmitted\r\nto New Hampshire were too niggardly, this thesis runs, the Fund's\r\nbreach both of the contract and of its fiduciary duty occurred in\r\nNew Hampshire.\r\nAs to Exeter's tort claim, we think that this reasoning\r\nis specious.  A breach of fiduciary duty occurs where the fiduciary\r\nacts disloyally.  See Young v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., 790 F.2d 567,\r\n570-71 (7th Cir. 1986); McFarland v. Yegen, 699 F. Supp. 10, 13\r\n(D.N.H. 1988).  Consequently, any breach of fiduciary duty in this\r\ncase occurred in Florida and arose when the Fund allegedly computed\r\nthe payments in artificially low amounts.  This means that the\r\nreceipt of payment was merely an in-forum effect of an extra-forum\r\nbreach and, therefore, inadequate to support a finding of\r\nrelatedness.  See Mass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 36; Sawtelle, 70\r\nF.3d at 1390-91; cf. Burger King, 471 U.S. at 474 (reiterating that\r\nthe foreseeability of causing injury in another state, without\r\nmore, is not a sufficient benchmark for exercising personal\r\njurisdiction in that state).  This makes eminent sense, for the\r\nreceipt of payment in New Hampshire could not conceivably have\r\ncaused the breach of the duty of loyalty of which Exeter complains. \r\nSee Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 207 (explaining that a main purpose of\r\nthe relatedness requirement is to ensure that \"the element of\r\ncausation remains in the forefront of the due process\r\ninvestigation\").  \r\nExeter's contractual claim requires a different analysis. \r\nAlthough the injury resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty might\r\nbe said to be complete when the fiduciary disregards his duty, see\r\nYoung, 790 F.2d at 570, a contract arguably is breached where a\r\npromisor fails to perform, see, e.g., Papachristou, 902 F.2d at\r\n686.  Indeed, courts repeatedly have held that the location where\r\npayments are due under a contract is a meaningful datum for\r\njurisdictional purposes.  See, e.g., Burger King, 471 U.S. at 480;\r\nGanis Corp. v. Jackson, 822 F.2d 194, 198 (1st Cir. 1987).  Even\r\nso, that fact alone does not possess decretory significance.  See\r\nKulko v. Superior Court, 436 U.S. 84, 93, 97 (1978) (finding no\r\npersonal jurisdiction in California as to contractual claims\r\nagainst a father to modify a custody agreement entered into in New\r\nYork, even though the agreement provided for support payments to\r\nthe mother and minor children in California); Hanson, 357 U.S. at\r\n252; Kerry Steel, Inc. v. Paragon Inds., 106 F.3d 147, 152 (6th\r\nCir. 1997); see also Scullin Steel Co. v. National Ry. Utiliz.\r\nCorp., 676 F.2d 309, 315 (8th Cir. 1982).  Exeter offers no\r\nconvincing argument as to why the location to which payments were\r\nsent is entitled to greater suasion here than in these cases.\r\nIn the last analysis, we agree with the district court\r\nthat, as to both claims, Exeter has failed to make a prima facie\r\nshowing of relatedness.  We hasten to add, however, that even if\r\nthe New Hampshire payments sufficed to show relatedness in respect\r\nto Exeter's breach-of-contract claim   the only close question\r\namong those discussed thus far   the lack of purposeful availment\r\nnevertheless would defeat jurisdiction.  We explain briefly.\r\nThe purposeful availment test requires us to consider\r\nwhether the Fund's contacts with New Hampshire \"represent a\r\npurposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in\r\n[New Hampshire], thereby invoking the benefits and protections of\r\n[its] laws and making the defendant[s'] involuntary presence before\r\nthe state's courts foreseeable.\"  United Elec. Workers, 960 F.2d at\r\n1089.  Exeter argues that because the Fund knowingly accepted the\r\nconditions imposed upon the bequest, it in effect reached out to\r\nExeter in New Hampshire.  But to make a prima facie showing of\r\npurposeful availment, it is not enough to prove that a defendant\r\nagreed to act as the trustee of a trust that benefitted a resident\r\nof the forum state.  See Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1392, 1394 (holding\r\nthat lawyers' acceptance of an attorney-client relationship with\r\nNew Hampshire clients was not purposeful availment vis--vis New\r\nHampshire).  Without evidence that the defendant actually reached\r\nout to the plaintiff's state of residence to create a relationship\r\nsay, by solicitation, see, e.g., Nowak, 94 F.3d at 716-17   the\r\nmere fact that the defendant willingly entered into a tendered\r\nrelationship does not carry the day.\r\nEven if a defendant's contacts with the forum are deemed\r\nvoluntary, the purposeful availment prong of the jurisdictional\r\ntest investigates whether the defendant benefitted from those\r\ncontacts in a way that made jurisdiction foreseeable.  See\r\nTicketmaster, 26 F.3d at 207.  Here, the Fund received a very large\r\nbequest as a result of its acceptance of the obligation to make\r\ncertain payments to Exeter, but this benefice did not flow from any\r\nrelationship with New Hampshire.  Indeed, the annual payments sent\r\nto Exeter in New Hampshire comprise the Fund's only pertinent\r\ncontacts with that state   and there is not so much as a hint that\r\nthe Fund benefitted in any way from the protections of New\r\nHampshire law in making these payments.  See Savin v. Ranier, 898\r\nF.2d 304, 307 (2d Cir. 1990); see also Bond Leather, 764 F.2d at\r\n934.  The very exiguousness of these contacts suggests that the\r\nFund could not reasonably have foreseen its susceptibility to suit\r\nin a New Hampshire court.  Hence, there was no purposeful\r\navailment.  See Hanson, 357 U.S. at 253; Mass. Sch. of Law, 142\r\nF.3d at 37.\r\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  Neither the Fund nor the Company\r\nhas contacts with New Hampshire that are sufficiently related to\r\nthe claims asserted in this case to permit the exercise of in\r\npersonam jurisdiction.  Moreover, such contacts as do exist and\r\narguably relate to the plaintiff's claims fail to evince purposeful\r\navailment of the benefits and protections of New Hampshire law. \r\nFor these reasons, an exercise of jurisdiction in New Hampshire\r\nwould offend due process.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",

This appeal presents a\r\njurisdictional tangle.  The seeds for the underlying litigation\r\nwere sown when the late Howard Phillips (Phillips or the testator)\r\nbequeathed all the stock in a profitable Florida-based real estate\r\ndevelopment company, Dr. Phillips, Inc. (the Company), to the\r\nHoward Phillips Fund (the Fund), upon the condition that the Fund\r\nshare the profits with Phillips Exeter Academy (Exeter), a private\r\nsecondary school located in New Hampshire.  Over time, Exeter\r\nconcluded that the Company and the Fund had short-shrifted it. \r\nWhen a disenchanted Exeter subsequently sued in New Hampshire's\r\nfederal district court, the court determined that it lacked\r\npersonal jurisdiction over the named defendants and dismissed the\r\naction.  Exeter appeals.  We affirm.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nPhillips resided in Florida and executed his will there. \r\nWhen he died in 1979, he held a power of appointment over all the\r\nshares in the Company.  His will directed that the stock be offered\r\nin turn to a series of family-sponsored charitable foundations. \r\nAfter one declined the gift, the Fund accepted it.\r\nThe testator was an alumnus of Exeter and a stalwart\r\nsupporter of his alma mater.  His will obligated the Fund, as a\r\ncondition to its receipt of the Company's stock, to vote the stock\r\nfor the election of an Exeter representative to the Company's\r\ngoverning board and to pay Exeter \"Five (5%) percent of the net\r\nincome from such stock . . . but not for more than twenty (20)\r\nyears after [Phillips's] death,\" along with \"Five (5%) percent of\r\nthe net proceeds of the stock\" if and when sold within the 20-year\r\nwindow.  Phillips's will further provided that \"any right to future\r\nincome shall cease\" upon a sale of the stock.  Although these were\r\nthe only firm conditions attached to the bequest, the testator\r\nexpressed his hope that the recipient of the stock would continue\r\nto focus its charitable efforts on the causes and institutions it\r\nhad favored when he was active in its direction and that it would\r\ngive Exeter 5% of its own net income annually for 20 years.  The\r\nFund, as a matter of practice, apparently fulfilled the first of\r\nthese velleities, continuing to devote most of its resources to\r\nfamiliar Florida charities (including Florida chapters of national\r\norganizations).  But for aught that appears, the Fund showed no\r\ninterest in channeling more money to Exeter.\r\nSoon after the Florida probate proceedings were\r\ncompleted, two things happened.  First, the Fund, acting at\r\nExeter's behest, elected John Emery   an Exeter alumnus who lives\r\nand works in New York   to the Company's board.  Second, H.E.\r\nJohnson, who then served as the chief executive officer of both the\r\nFund and the Company   the two entities were under common control,\r\nand remained so thereafter   consulted Emery about the possibility\r\nof a lump-sum commutation of the Fund's present and future\r\nobligations to Exeter.  Exeter turned a deaf ear to this entreaty,\r\nand the Fund proceeded to send checks annually to Exeter in New\r\nHampshire, each equaling 5% of the dividend declared by the Company\r\nfor the year in question.\r\nAnother settlement overture occurred in 1992, when\r\nJohnson's successor, James Hinson, visited the school's headmaster\r\nin New Hampshire.  This visit   which marked the only time that an\r\nofficial of either defendant set foot in New Hampshire to conduct\r\nExeter-related business   proved unavailing.  The next year, Hinson\r\nagain unsuccessfully proposed a settlement, this time by letter.\r\nThe Fund and the Company both altered their corporate\r\nforms in the years following the testator's demise.  In 1980, the\r\nFund converted from a private family foundation (known as the Della\r\nPhillips Foundation) to its present incarnation as a charitable\r\nsupport organization (known as the Howard Phillips Fund).  This\r\nmaneuver enabled it to hold the Company's stock indefinitely,\r\nwithout risk of escalating tax penalties.  Compare 26 U.S.C.  4943\r\n(describing tax consequences for private foundations with \"excess\r\nbusiness holdings\"), with id.  509(a)(3) (excluding charitable\r\nsupport organizations from the definition of \"private foundation\"). \r\nIn 1997, management merged the Company, until then an ordinary\r\nbusiness corporation, into a newly established Delaware nonprofit\r\ncorporation of the same name, with the result that the Fund became\r\nthe sole member of the Company rather than its sole stockholder. \r\nDespite the conversion of its stock interest to a membership\r\ninterest, the Fund made no contemporaneous payment to Exeter.\r\nExeter received its next annual check   an unusually\r\nlarge one, geared to the Company's net income, rather than to its\r\nannual dividend   from the Company instead of the Fund.  Shortly\r\nthereafter, Exeter filed suit, claiming that the Fund and the\r\nCompany were liable in both tort and contract because (1) the \r\ntransmitted payments, computed by the Fund on the basis of 5% of\r\nthe Company's annual dividends, fell well short of the Fund's\r\nobligation to pay Exeter 5% of the Company's annual income; (2) the\r\nrestructuring that had occurred was designed to thwart the\r\ntestator's intention that the Fund sell the stock within 20 years\r\nand deliver 5% of the net sale proceeds to Exeter; and (3) in all\r\nevents, when the Fund exchanged its stock ownership for a\r\nmembership interest, it should have paid Exeter 5% of the Company's\r\nvalue.  The district court did not address the substance of these\r\nallegations but, rather, granted the Fund's and the Company's joint\r\nmotion to dismiss the action for want of personal jurisdiction. \r\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).  This appeal ensued.\r\nII.  ANALYSIS\r\nNew Hampshire's long-arm statute reaches to the full\r\nextent that the Constitution allows.  See Phelps v. Kingston, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 742 (N.H. 1987); Computac v.

Aware of this reality, the court below\r\nsensibly focused on federal constitutional standards, and the\r\nparties   who agree on little else   have briefed the appeal in\r\nthose terms.  Thus, we proceed directly to the constitutional\r\ninquiry.\r\nThe Due Process Clause prohibits a court from imposing\r\nits will on persons whose actions do not place them in a position\r\nwhere they reasonably can foresee that they might be called to\r\naccount in that jurisdiction.  See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v.\r\nWoodson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110170\"><a href=\"/opinion/110170/world-wide-volkswagen-corp-v-woodson/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 297 (1980).  Although this regime is\r\ngrounded in principles of fundamental fairness, it is written more\r\nin shades of grey than in black and white.  See Burger King Corp.\r\nv. Rudzewicz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111429\"><a href=\"/opinion/111429/burger-king-corp-v-rudzewicz/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 486 n.29 (1985); United Elec., Radio &amp;\r\nMach. Workers v. 163 Pleasant St. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580868\"><a href=\"/opinion/580868/united-electrical-radio-and-machine-workers-of-america-v-163-pleasant/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1080</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1088 (1st\r\nCir. 1992).\r\nThe accepted mode of analysis for questions involving\r\npersonal jurisdiction concentrates on the quality and quantity of\r\nthe potential defendant's contacts with the forum.  See\r\nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104200\"><a href=\"/opinion/104200/international-shoe-co-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316 (1945). \r\nThus, a defendant who has maintained a continuous and systematic\r\nlinkage with the forum state brings himself within the general\r\njurisdiction of that state's courts in respect to all matters, even\r\nthose that are unrelated to the defendant's contacts with the\r\nforum.  See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111159\"><a href=\"/opinion/111159/helicopteros-nacionales-de-colombia-sa-v-hall/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 414 (1984); Donatelli v. National Hockey League, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534783\"><a href=\"/opinion/534783/john-clark-donatelli-v-national-hockey-league/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 462-63 (1st Cir. 1990).  Short of general jurisdiction, a\r\ncourt still may hear a particular case if that case relates\r\nsufficiently to, or arises from, a significant subset of contacts\r\nbetween the defendant and the forum.  See Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at\r\n414; Donatelli, 893 F.2d at 462-63.  Exeter has never claimed that\r\nthe Fund and the Company are subject to the general jurisdiction of\r\nNew Hampshire's courts.  Hence, it is the latter type of personal\r\njurisdiction   commonly called \"specific jurisdiction\"   that is at\r\nissue here.\r\nThe inquiry into specific jurisdiction lends itself to a\r\ntripartite analysis.  See Massachusetts Sch. of Law at Andover,\r\nInc. v. American Bar Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (1st Cir. 1998);\r\nTicketmaster-N.Y., Inc. v. Alioto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672029\"><a href=\"/opinion/672029/ticketmaster-new-york-inc-v-joseph-m-alioto/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  First, an inquiring court must ask whether the claim that\r\nundergirds the litigation directly relates to or arises out of the\r\ndefendant's contacts with the forum.  Second, the court must ask\r\nwhether those contacts constitute purposeful availment of the\r\nbenefits and protections afforded by the forum's laws.  Third, if\r\nthe proponent's case clears the first two hurdles, the court then\r\nmust analyze the overall reasonableness of an exercise of\r\njurisdiction in light of a variety of pertinent factors that touch\r\nupon the fundamental fairness of an exercise of jurisdiction.  See\r\nUnited Elec. Workers, 960 F.2d at 1088 (discussing this aspect of\r\nthe inquiry and dubbing these factors the \"Gestalt factors\").  An\r\naffirmative finding on each of the three elements of the test is\r\nrequired to support a finding of specific jurisdiction.\r\nThe district court went no further than the first tier of\r\nthe test in ruling that neither defendant was subject to its\r\njurisdiction.  Concluding, on largely undisputed facts, that the\r\ncauses of action that Exeter pleaded did not arise out of or relate\r\nsufficiently to the defendants' contacts with New Hampshire, the\r\ncourt decided that Exeter had failed to make a prima facie showing\r\nadequate to justify an exercise of specific jurisdiction.  We\r\nreview this decision de novo, see Foster-Miller, Inc. v. Babcock &amp;\r\nWilcox Can., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195899\"><a href=\"/opinion/195899/foster-miller-inc-v-babcock/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 147 (1st Cir. 1995), mindful that we are\r\nnot wedded to the lower court's reasoning, but may affirm the\r\njudgment for any independent reason made manifest in the record,\r\nsee Hachikian v. FDIC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196973\"><a href=\"/opinion/196973/hachikian-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 504 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\nThe district court made a painstakingly thoughtful\r\nanalysis.  Its methodology was to compile a list of the Fund's\r\nactivities in New Hampshire   transmitting checks into the state\r\nonce a year, sending a few letters to Exeter, and visiting Exeter\r\non one occasion in an effort to forge a settlement   and then to\r\nexplore the interrelationship between Exeter's claims and these\r\ncontacts.  The court made this exploration on a claim-by-claim\r\nbasis.  As to the contract claim, the court noted that the relevant\r\ncontract had been created in Florida (when the Fund accepted the\r\nconditional bequest) and that, if the contract was breached, the\r\nbreach also occurred in Florida (where the Fund decided what\r\namounts would be disbursed to Exeter).  Turning to the tort claim,\r\nthe court could discern no causal connection between the Fund's New\r\nHampshire contacts and either the alleged breach of fiduciary duty\r\nor the injury resulting therefrom.  Consequently, the court held\r\nthat none of Exeter's claims was sufficiently related to the Fund's\r\ncontacts with New Hampshire to warrant the exercise of personal\r\njurisdiction.\r\nWe commend the lower court's decision to analyze the\r\ncontract and tort claims discretely.  Questions of specific\r\njurisdiction are always tied to the particular claims asserted. \r\nSee United Elec. Workers, 960 F.2d at 1089 (stating that \"the\r\ndefendant's in-state conduct must form an 'important, or [at least]\r\nmaterial, element of proof' in the plaintiff's case\") (quoting\r\nMarino v. Hyatt Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471761\"><a href=\"/opinion/471761/mary-marino-and-thomas-marino-v-hyatt-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">793</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 430 (1st Cir. 1986)).  In\r\ncontract cases, a court charged with determining the existence vel\r\nnon of personal jurisdiction must look to the elements of the cause\r\nof action and ask whether the defendant's contacts with the forum\r\nwere instrumental either in the formation of the contract or in its\r\nbreach.  See, e.g., id. at 1089-90; Jones v. Petty-Ray Geophysical,\r\nGeosource, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576667\"><a href=\"/opinion/576667/brenda-jones-individually-and-as-administratrix-of-the-estate-of-evan-am/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1061</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1068 (5th Cir. 1992); Papachristou\r\nv.

See Nowak v. Tak How Invs., Ltd., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725496\"><a href=\"/opinion/725496/ralph-m-nowak-administrator-of-the-estate-of-sally-ann-nowak-v-tak-how/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 715-16 (1st Cir. 1996); Sawtelle v. Farrell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709024\"><a href=\"/opinion/709024/arthur-f-sawtelle-etc-v-george-e-farrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1390 (1st Cir. 1995).  Thus, the court below appropriately\r\ndrew a distinction between Exeter's contract and tort claims.  See\r\nMass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 35.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we turn to Exeter's contentions\r\nthat the district court conflated the relatedness and purposeful\r\navailment inquiries, and failed to recognize that, in gauging\r\nrelatedness, a defendant's contacts with the forum state are not\r\nnecessarily limited to moments of physical presence.  In Exeter's\r\nview, the Fund's ongoing relationship with, and obligations to, a\r\nNew Hampshire beneficiary comprise contacts that satisfy the\r\nrelatedness requirement.\r\nTo be sure, there is a natural blurring of the\r\nrelatedness and purposeful availment inquiries in cases (like this\r\none) in which the alleged contacts are less tangible than physical\r\npresence; in such circumstances, an inquiring court must determine\r\nthe extent to which the defendant directed an out-of-state activity\r\nat the forum state in order to ascertain whether the activity can\r\nbe termed a contact at all.  See, e.g., id. at 36.  This\r\ndetermination bears at least a family resemblance to a\r\ndetermination of whether a defendant purposefully availed himself\r\nof the protections of the forum state.  Notwithstanding this\r\nresemblance, however, the inquiries are different, see James Wm.\r\nMoore, Moore's Federal Practice  108.42[2][a] (3d ed. 1999), and\r\nwe reject Exeter's contention that the district court confused\r\nthem.\r\nExeter's principal argument along this line is that the\r\nfiduciary relationship between the parties should itself have been\r\nevaluated as a New Hampshire contact related to Exeter's claims. \r\nWe agree with one premise that underlies this argument:  to be\r\nconstitutionally significant, forum-state contacts need not involve\r\nphysical presence.  See Burger King, 471 U.S. at 476.  We disagree,\r\nhowever, with Exeter's attempt to invoke this premise here.  It is\r\nnot the relationship itself, but the content of the parties'\r\ninteractions that creates constitutionally significant contacts. \r\nThus, \"[t]he relatedness requirement is not met merely because a\r\nplaintiff's cause of action arose out of the general relationship\r\nbetween the parties; rather, the action must directly arise out of\r\nthe specific contacts between the defendant and the forum state.\" \r\nSawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1389.  The district court adhered to this rule\r\nand correctly focused on the forum-based activities surrounding the\r\nFund's relationship with Exeter   without regard to whether they\r\nentailed physical presence   rather than on the relationship\r\nitself.\r\nExeter's claim that this approach ignores the teachings\r\nof Burger King lacks force.  As Exeter points out, Burger King\r\nupheld the Florida courts' exercise of jurisdiction over a Michigan\r\nfranchisee of a Florida corporation in part because of the parties'\r\n\"carefully structured 20-year relationship that envisioned\r\ncontinuing and wide-reaching [Florida] contacts.\"  471 U.S. at 480. \r\nBut this snippet does not paint the whole picture:  the Burger King\r\nCourt made clear that the mere existence of a contractual\r\nrelationship between an out-of-state defendant and an in-state\r\nplaintiff does not suffice, in and of itself, to establish\r\njurisdiction in the plaintiff's home state.  See id. at 478-79. \r\nRather, \"prior negotiations and contemplated future consequences,\r\nalong with the terms of the contract and the parties' actual course\r\nof dealing . . . must be evaluated in determining whether the\r\ndefendant purposefully established minimum contacts within the\r\nforum.\"  Id. at 479.  The district court's approach was faithful to\r\nthis instruction.\r\nWe next proceed to the court's implementation of the\r\napproach.  As we have indicated, the relevant interactions between\r\nthe parties and the proposed forum must be assayed in light of the\r\nnature of the plaintiff's claim.  See United Elec. Workers, 960\r\nF.2d at 1089.  For example, in  Hanson v. Denckla, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105728\"><a href=\"/opinion/105728/hanson-v-denckla/\"><span class=\"volume\">357</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(1958), the settlor had executed a trust indenture in Delaware,\r\nnaming a Delaware trustee who administered the trust corpus in that\r\nstate.  See id. at 238.  The settlor later moved to Florida, but\r\ncontinued to receive payments from the trust.  See id. at 252.  She\r\nalso purported to exercise a power of appointment reserved in the\r\ntrust indenture.  See id. at 239.  Upon her death, certain legatees\r\nsued the trustee in a Florida court, seeking to declare the\r\nreservation invalid.  See id. at 240-42.  Because the plaintiffs'\r\nclaim focused on the validity vel non of the Delaware trust and the\r\npower-of-appointment provision, the Court held that the claim did\r\nnot arise out of in-forum contacts even though the power of\r\nappointment had been exercised in Florida by a Florida resident who\r\nhad been receiving regular payments there from the trustee.  See\r\nid. at 251-52.  At the same time, however, the Court left open the\r\npossibility that a different claim   one focused on the propriety\r\nof the exercise of the power of appointment   might give rise to\r\njurisdiction over the trustee in Florida.  See id. at 253 &amp; n.25.\r\nHanson suggests that we must determine the focal point of\r\neach of the plaintiff's claims and assess the interactions between\r\nthe defendant and the forum state through that prism.  Here,\r\nhowever, regardless of whether this dispute is viewed as a breach\r\nof contract case or a breach of fiduciary duty case, the same two\r\nlandmarks predominate:  the meaning of the testator's will and the\r\nFund's fulfillment of the obligations that it undertook coincident\r\nto its acceptance of the bequest.  Most of the relevant\r\ninteractions (e.g., the execution of the will, the acceptance of\r\nthe bequest, and the payment decisions) occurred in Florida.  The\r\nrest (e.g., the restructuring of the Company and the conversion of\r\nthe Fund's ownership interest to a membership interest) occurred in\r\nDelaware.  From this vantage point, Exeter's claim to jurisdiction\r\nin New Hampshire appears untenable.  See Bond Leather Co. v. Q.T.\r\nShoe Mfg. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453493\"><a href=\"/opinion/453493/bond-leather-co-inc-v-qt-shoe-mfg-co-inc-and-martin-s-nadler/\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 934 (1st Cir. 1985).\r\nExeter has another string to its jurisdictional bow. \r\nNotwithstanding that the formation of the relationship had nothing\r\nto do with New Hampshire, it asseverates that the consequences of\r\nthe relationship involved contacts with New Hampshire sufficient to\r\nsubject the Fund to the jurisdiction of the New Hampshire courts. \r\nSee Burger King, 471 U.S. at 479.  Because the payments transmitted\r\nto New Hampshire were too niggardly, this thesis runs, the Fund's\r\nbreach both of the contract and of its fiduciary duty occurred in\r\nNew Hampshire.\r\nAs to Exeter's tort claim, we think that this reasoning\r\nis specious.  A breach of fiduciary duty occurs where the fiduciary\r\nacts disloyally.  See Young v. Colgate-Palmolive Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469863\"><a href=\"/opinion/469863/quentin-young-individually-and-on-behalf-of-those-similarly-situated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">790</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">567</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n570-71 (7th Cir. 1986); McFarland v. Yegen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1418808\"><a href=\"/opinion/1418808/mcfarland-v-yegen/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13\r\n(D.N.H. 1988).  Consequently, any breach of fiduciary duty in this\r\ncase occurred in Florida and arose when the Fund allegedly computed\r\nthe payments in artificially low amounts.  This means that the\r\nreceipt of payment was merely an in-forum effect of an extra-forum\r\nbreach and, therefore, inadequate to support a finding of\r\nrelatedness.  See Mass. Sch. of Law, 142 F.3d at 36; Sawtelle, 70\r\nF.3d at 1390-91; cf. Burger King, 471 U.S. at 474 (reiterating that\r\nthe foreseeability of causing injury in another state, without\r\nmore, is not a sufficient benchmark for exercising personal\r\njurisdiction in that state).  This makes eminent sense, for the\r\nreceipt of payment in New Hampshire could not conceivably have\r\ncaused the breach of the duty of loyalty of which Exeter complains. \r\nSee Ticketmaster, 26 F.3d at 207 (explaining that a main purpose of\r\nthe relatedness requirement is to ensure that \"the element of\r\ncausation remains in the forefront of the due process\r\ninvestigation\").  \r\nExeter's contractual claim requires a different analysis. \r\nAlthough the injury resulting from a breach of fiduciary duty might\r\nbe said to be complete when the fiduciary disregards his duty, see\r\nYoung, 790 F.2d at 570, a contract arguably is breached where a\r\npromisor fails to perform, see, e.g., Papachristou, 902 F.2d at\r\n686.  Indeed, courts repeatedly have held that the location where\r\npayments are due under a contract is a meaningful datum for\r\njurisdictional purposes.  See, e.g., Burger King, 471 U.S. at 480;\r\nGanis Corp. v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490519\"><a href=\"/opinion/490519/ganis-corporation-of-california-v-neil-d-jackson-and-ann-e-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 198 (1st Cir. 1987).  Even\r\nso, that fact alone does not possess decretory significance.  See\r\nKulko v. Superior Court, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109858\"><a href=\"/opinion/109858/kulko-v-superior-court-of-cal-city-and-county-of-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93, 97 (1978) (finding no\r\npersonal jurisdiction in California as to contractual claims\r\nagainst a father to modify a custody agreement entered into in New\r\nYork, even though the agreement provided for support payments to\r\nthe mother and minor children in California); Hanson, 357 U.S. at\r\n252; Kerry Steel, Inc. v.

Exeter offers no\r\nconvincing argument as to why the location to which payments were\r\nsent is entitled to greater suasion here than in these cases.\r\nIn the last analysis, we agree with the district court\r\nthat, as to both claims, Exeter has failed to make a prima facie\r\nshowing of relatedness.  We hasten to add, however, that even if\r\nthe New Hampshire payments sufficed to show relatedness in respect\r\nto Exeter's breach-of-contract claim   the only close question\r\namong those discussed thus far   the lack of purposeful availment\r\nnevertheless would defeat jurisdiction.  We explain briefly.\r\nThe purposeful availment test requires us to consider\r\nwhether the Fund's contacts with New Hampshire \"represent a\r\npurposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities in\r\n[New Hampshire], thereby invoking the benefits and protections of\r\n[its] laws and making the defendant[s'] involuntary presence before\r\nthe state's courts foreseeable.\"  United Elec. Workers, 960 F.2d at\r\n1089.  Exeter argues that because the Fund knowingly accepted the\r\nconditions imposed upon the bequest, it in effect reached out to\r\nExeter in New Hampshire.  But to make a prima facie showing of\r\npurposeful availment, it is not enough to prove that a defendant\r\nagreed to act as the trustee of a trust that benefitted a resident\r\nof the forum state.  See Sawtelle, 70 F.3d at 1392, 1394 (holding\r\nthat lawyers' acceptance of an attorney-client relationship with\r\nNew Hampshire clients was not purposeful availment vis--vis New\r\nHampshire).  Without evidence that the defendant actually reached\r\nout to the plaintiff's state of residence to create a relationship\r\nsay, by solicitation, see, e.g., Nowak, 94 F.3d at 716-17   the\r\nmere fact that the defendant willingly entered into a tendered\r\nrelationship does not carry the day.\r\nEven if a defendant's contacts with the forum are deemed\r\nvoluntary, the purposeful availment prong of the jurisdictional\r\ntest investigates whether the defendant benefitted from those\r\ncontacts in a way that made jurisdiction foreseeable.  See\r\nTicketmaster, 26 F.3d at 207.  Here, the Fund received a very large\r\nbequest as a result of its acceptance of the obligation to make\r\ncertain payments to Exeter, but this benefice did not flow from any\r\nrelationship with New Hampshire.  Indeed, the annual payments sent\r\nto Exeter in New Hampshire comprise the Fund's only pertinent\r\ncontacts with that state   and there is not so much as a hint that\r\nthe Fund benefitted in any way from the protections of New\r\nHampshire law in making these payments.  See Savin v. Ranier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538377\"><a href=\"/opinion/538377/scott-c-savin-v-harry-h-ranier/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 307 (2d Cir. 1990); see also Bond Leather, 764 F.2d at\r\n934.  The very exiguousness of these contacts suggests that the\r\nFund could not reasonably have foreseen its susceptibility to suit\r\nin a New Hampshire court.  Hence, there was no purposeful\r\navailment.  See Hanson, 357 U.S. at 253; Mass. Sch. of Law, 142\r\nF.3d at 37.\r\nIII.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  Neither the Fund nor the Company\r\nhas contacts with New Hampshire that are sufficiently related to\r\nthe claims asserted in this case to permit the exercise of in\r\npersonam jurisdiction.  Moreover, such contacts as do exist and\r\narguably relate to the plaintiff's claims fail to evince purposeful\r\navailment of the benefits and protections of New Hampshire law. \r\nFor these reasons, an exercise of jurisdiction in New Hampshire\r\nwould offend due process.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
