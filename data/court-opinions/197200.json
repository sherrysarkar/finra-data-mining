Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                              \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nWilliam S. Sires, Jr. on brief pro se.\r                                 \r\nNancy  Ankers  White,  Special  Assistant  Attorney  General,  and\r                                \r\nCharles   M.  Wyzanski,   Senior  Litigation   Counsel,  Massachusetts\r                              \r\nDepartment  of  Correction,  on  Motion For  Summary  Disposition  and\r\nMemorandum Of Law for appellees.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                      February 10, 1997\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  Appellant  William Sires, an inmate  in the\r                           \r\n\nMassachusetts  prison system, appeals  a district court order\r\n\ndenying  his  motion  to   hold  appellees  in  contempt  for\r\n\nviolation of  a previous court order requiring  that they use\r\n\ntheir best efforts  to ensure that he  receive proper medical\r\n\ncare while  in prison.   Sires further  alleges the  district\r\n\ncourt erred in  refusing to grant  his request for  discovery\r\n\nand  the subpoena of witnesses.   Sires also  appeals a court\r\n\norder relieving  his court appointed  counsel of the  duty of\r\n\nfurther representing him and refusing to appoint new counsel.\r\n\nFinally,  Sires  claims  that  the district  court  erred  in\r\n\nordering  him not  to  \"file any  additional motions  without\r\n\nprior authorization  of this court.\"  We  affirm the district\r\n\ncourt on all claims, except that of the injunction.\r\n\n     The district  court in the  instant case held  a lengthy\r\n\nhearing at which it heard testimony concerning the quality of\r\n\nSires'  health  care.    It  then  made  a  factual  finding,\r\n\nsupportable in the record, that, while that care had not been\r\n\n\"optimal,\"  appellees had  nevertheless  made  a  good  faith\r\n\neffort to comply with  the previous order.  We  have reviewed\r\n\nthe record carefully and  find no abuse of discretion  in the\r\n\ncourt's denial of Sires' contempt motion. \r\n\n     Moreover,  the record indicates  that Sires  suffered no\r\n\nprejudice  from the  district  court's failure  to grant  his\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nrequest for the  production of documents  and the issuing  of\r\n\nsubpoenas to witnesses.  \r\n\n     Appointment of counsel in a civil proceeding is required\r\n\nonly  in \"exceptional  circumstances.\"  DesRosiers  v. Moran,\r                                                                        \r\n\n949 F.2d 15, 23 (1st Cir.  1991).  The record indicates  that\r\n\nthe  issues at the contempt hearing were not complex and that\r\n\nSires was  well able  to represent  himself.  Therefore,  the\r\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in  relieving Sires' court\r\n\nappointed counsel  of the duty of  further representation and\r\n\nrefusing to appoint new counsel. \r\n\n     In respect to the injunction, federal courts do \"possess\r\n\ndiscretionary  powers to  regulate  the  conduct  of  abusive\r\n\nlitigants.\"   Cok v. Family  Court of Rhode  Island, 985 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n32,   34  (1st   Cir.  1993).     Accordingly,   \"in  extreme\r\n\ncircumstances  involving  groundless  encroachment  upon  the\r\n\nlimited time and resources of the court and other parties, an\r\n\ninjunction  barring  a  party  from  filing  and   processing\r\n\nfrivolous  and  vexatious   [motions]  may  be  appropriate.\"\r\n\nCastro v. United States,  775 F.2d 399, 408 (1st  Cir. 1984).\r                                   \r\n\nNevertheless,  any bar must be \"narrowly tailored.\"  Sires v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGabriel,  748   F.2d  49,  51   (1st  Cir.  1984),   lest  it\r                   \r\n\n\"impermissibly infringe upon a litigator's right of access to\r\n\nthe courts,\"   Castro, 775  F.2d at 410.   Such an injunction\r                                 \r\n\nmust \"remain very much  the exception to the general  rule of\r\n\nfree access to the  courts\" and must be used  with particular\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ncaution against a pro  se plaintiff.  Pavilonis v.  King, 626\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 1075, 1079 (1st Cir. 1980).  This court reviews entry of\r\n\nsuch injunctions for abuse of discretion.  Id. at 408.\r                                                         \r\n\n     The injunction in this case is more problematic.   Sires\r\n\nwas  not  \"warned  or  otherwise  given  notice  that  filing\r\n\nrestrictions were contemplated,\" Cok, 985 F.2d at 35;  he had\r                                                \r\n\nnot been afforded \"an opportunity to respond\" before entry of\r\n\nthe  injunction, see id.; and  there was no  request from the\r                                    \r\n\ndefendants for such an order, see Pavilonis, 626 F.2d at 1079\r                                                       \r\n\n(\"Generally,  this kind  of  order should  not be  considered\r\n\nabsent a request by the harassed defendants.\").  While no one\r\n\nof   these  factors,   standing   alone,  would   necessarily\r\n\ninvalidate the injunction, they are fatal here because it  is\r\n\nunclear that the  record supports the injunction.   Denial of\r\n\nroutine access  to the courts  is an  \"extreme\" measure,  and\r\n\n\"[l]itigiousness   alone   will   not   support   [such]   an\r\n\ninjunction.\"   Id.  Here, however, the district court made no\r                              \r\n\nfindings that Sires'  filings had been  frivolous, vexatious,\r\n\nor otherwise of a type and kind that would justify injunctive\r\n\nrelief.   Therefore, the fairest course here is to vacate the\r\n\ninjunction and remand the  case for such further proceedings,\r\n\nif any, as the district court desires to undertake.\r\n\n     Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.\r                                                                \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
