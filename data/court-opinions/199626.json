Gagnon, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n                     ____________________\n\f                            October 5, 2001\n                         ____________________\n\n            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Jonathan Cash pled guilty to bank\n\nrobbery, 18 U.S.C. § 2113(a). On appeal he challenges his eighty-four\n\nmonth prison sentence, claiming that the district court erred in three\n\nrespects: (1) in considering statements attributed in the Pre-Sentence\n\nReport to his cellmate Thomas Spillane where Spillane, citing his Fifth\n\nAmendment privilege, refused to testify at sentencing; (2) in awarding\n\na two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. §\n\n3C1.1 for an attempted escape from prison; and (3) in not reducing\n\ndefendant's sentence for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. §\n\n3E1.1(B).\n\n                                   I.\n\n            These facts were developed at Cash's sentencing hearing. The\n\nday before Cash pled guilty to the bank robbery, a correctional officer\n\nheard a noise and saw Cash using his hands to sweep up Sheetrock dust\n\nfrom the floor of his cell. There were also small pieces of Sheetrock\n\non the cell floor. When questioned by the officer, Cash said that the\n\nwhite particles on the floor and in his hair were soap flakes that he\n\nand another inmate, a laundry room employee, had been throwing around.\n\nThe officer replied that the dust looked like Sheetrock, not soap.\n\nCash rejoined that the other inmate and he had been horsing around.\n\nThat inmate, however, denied the story and had been talking with\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fanother officer at the    time, as the officer confirmed.     Cash's\n\ncellmate, Spillane, had no such dust in his hair.\n\n          The next day, another officer saw Cash's cellmate cowering\n\nalone in a corner of the cell. After examining the cell and noticing\n\na hole in the ceiling, the officer questioned the cellmate, Spillane,\n\nwho responded that he had \"nothing to do\" with the hole. (Spillane's\n\nstatements were set forth in the Pre-Sentence Report.) Two officers\n\nthen searched the cell and found a pry bar, a bag filled with\n\nSheetrock, and a small grate that had been in the ceiling, as well as\n\na hole in the wall.\n\n          The next day, an officer saw Cash assault Spillane, hitting\n\nhim several times and stabbing a pen into Spillane's head and neck.\n\nDuring the stabbing, Cash said \"nobody likes a rat.\"\n\n                                II.\n\nHearsay Objection at Sentencing.\n\n          Cash contends that the district court wrongfully took into\n\naccount hearsay statements made by Spillane and that he was harmed\n\nsince he was unable to cross-examine Spillane. He says Spillane's\n\nstatement was an effort to shift blame for the escape holes to Cash,\n\nand so the statement was inherently unreliable.\n\n          The admission into evidence of hearsay statements made by\n\nSpillane is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Traditional rules of\n\nevidence do not govern the sentencing phase; nonetheless, hearsay\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fshould provide sufficient indicia of reliability before it is admitted.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 6A1.3. Here, there was nothing inherently unreliable about\n\nthe statement and it was corroborated by, inter alia, Cash's lie to the\n\nguard. There was no error. See United States v. Brewster, 127 F.3d\n\n22, 27-28 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nObstruction of Justice.\n\n          The district court's factual determination underlying its\n\ndecision to award a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice is\n\nreviewed for clear error. See United States v. Cardales, 168 F.3d 548,\n\n558 (1st Cir. 1999). Escaping or attempting to escape from custody\n\nbefore sentencing is a proper basis for enhancement under U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3C1.1 app. note 4(e). See United States v. Emery, 991 F.2d 907, 912\n\n(1st Cir. 1993); United States v. McCarthy, 961 F.2d 972, 979 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).   Thus, no question of law is presented.\n\n          Cash argues that the evidence did not show an attempted\n\nescape, but rather established only that he \"was in the cell and that\n\nthere were white dust-like particles in his hair.\"        Not so. The\n\nevidence supports a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\nCash was responsible for the holes in the ceiling and wall of the cell:\n\nCash was seen sweeping up the Sheetrock debris; had debris in his hair;\n\ndeceitfully explained to the officer that he and another inmate had\n\nbeen playing with soap; and subsequently assaulted his cellmate,\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fcalling him a rat, after his cellmate denied having anything to do with\n\nthe hole.    There was no error.\n\nAcceptance of Responsibility.\n\n            A downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is not\n\nautomatically awarded to a defendant pleading guilty, and a district\n\ncourt's denial of such an adjustment will not be disturbed unless it is\n\nclearly erroneous. See United States v. Garcia, 905 F.2d 557, 561 (1st\n\nCir. 1990). In cases involving both an obstruction of justice finding\n\nand a defendant's request for acceptance of responsibility credit, the\n\ncommentary to the guidelines says that such credit may be given only in\n\n\"extraordinary\" cases. U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 app. note 4; United States v.\n\nLagasse, 87 F.3d 18, 25 (1st Cir. 1996).          As the note states:\n\n\"[c]onduct resulting in an enhancement [for obstruction of justice]\n\nordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility\n\nfor his criminal conduct.\"       U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 app. note 4.\n\n            Cash's argument is that even if he was unrepentant about his\n\nescape attempt and his assault on his cellmate, he could be truly\n\nrepentant about the bank robbery. Cf. United States v. Morrison, 983\n\nF.2d 730 (6th Cir. 1993). It is true that a court may not require a\n\ndefendant to accept responsibility for conduct beyond the offense of\n\nconviction, although such conduct may be considered. Lagasse, 87 F.3d\n\nat 25. Whatever the merits of Cash's argument in the abstract, it does\n\nnot work here. Cash was trying to escape from facing responsibility\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fand sentencing for the bank robbery -- the offense of conviction. It\n\ncan hardly be clear error for the district court to conclude that Cash,\n\ntrying to avoid the penalty for bank robbery, was not entitled to\n\nacceptance of responsibility credit for his offense. Indeed, it is\n\ndifficult to even imagine circumstances extraordinary enough to permit\n\na conclusion that one who seeks to run away from facing the\n\nconsequences for his crime has accepted responsibility for the crime.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",

The evidence supports a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Cash was responsible for the holes in the ceiling and wall of the cell: Cash was seen sweeping up the Sheetrock debris; had debris in his hair; deceitfully explained to the officer that he and another inmate had been playing with soap; and subsequently assaulted his cellmate, calling him a rat, after his cellmate denied having anything to do with the hole. There was no error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acceptance of Responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility is not automatically awarded to a defendant pleading guilty, and a district court's denial of such an adjustment will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous. See United States v. Garcia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543072\"><a href=\"/opinion/543072/united-states-v-francisco-rodrigo-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></a></span>, 561 (1st Cir. 1990). In cases involving both an obstruction of justice finding and a defendant's request for acceptance of responsibility credit, the commentary to the guidelines says that such credit may be given only in \"extraordinary\" cases. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 app. note 4; United States v. Lagasse, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196833\"><a href=\"/opinion/196833/united-states-v-lagasse/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir. 1996). As the note states: \"[c]onduct resulting in an enhancement [for obstruction of justice] ordinarily indicates that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 app. note 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cash's argument is that even if he was unrepentant about his escape attempt and his assault on his cellmate, he could be truly repentant about the bank robbery. Cf. United States v. Morrison, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597851\"><a href=\"/opinion/597851/united-states-v-dana-ray-morrison/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span> (6th Cir. 1993). It is true that a court may not require a defendant to accept responsibility for conduct beyond the offense of conviction, although such conduct may be considered. Lagasse, 87 F.3d at 25. Whatever the merits of Cash's argument in the abstract, it does not work here. Cash was trying to escape from facing responsibility and sentencing for the bank robbery -- the offense of conviction. It can hardly be clear error for the district court to conclude that Cash, trying to avoid the penalty for bank robbery, was not entitled to acceptance of responsibility credit for his offense. Indeed, it is difficult to even imagine circumstances extraordinary enough to permit a conclusion that one who seeks to run away from facing the consequences for his crime has accepted responsibility for the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
