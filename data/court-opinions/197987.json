We have reviewed the parties' briefs and\r\nthe  record on appeal.  We affirm the district court judgment\r\ndismissing appellant's motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \r\n2255, essentially for the reasons stated in the magistrate-\r\njudge's report and recommendation, dated March 21, 1997, and\r\nthe district court's opinion and order, dated September 8,\r\n1997.  We add only this.  Viera-Negron admitted to carrying the\r\nfirearm on his person in a shoulder bag.  We do not think his\r\nclaim raises any serious question about accessibility of the\r\nweapon.  See United States v. Cleveland, 106 F.3d 1056 (1st\r\nCir. 1997), cert. granted.  We decline to consider the issues\r\nthat appellant failed to present to the district court in this\r\n 2255 motion and raised for the first time on appeal.  SeeUnited States v. Haggert, 980 F.2d 8, 10 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
