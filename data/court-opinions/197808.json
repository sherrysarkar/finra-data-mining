The Woods  Hole,  Martha's  Vineyard and\r                            \r\n\nNantucket  Steamship  Authority (\"the  Steamship  Authority\")\r\n\nappeals from a  jury verdict awarding  damages to John  Ford.\r\n\nFord  was an  able bodied  seaman employed  on the  Steamship\r\n\nAuthority's  M/V Eagle, a  passenger and car  ferry operating\r\n\nbetween Hyannis and  Nantucket, Massachusetts.  On the day of\r\n\nFord's misfortune, February 24, 1995,  the Eagle was laid  up\r\n\nfor general maintenance in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  \r\n\n     The drama began when one of  Ford's fellow seamen, Byron\r\n\nCosta, approached  a paint  trailer on the  pier next  to the\r\n\nship.  Danny Pryor, the ship's boatswain and Costa's brother-\r\n\nin-law, was  with him.   Costa was  holding a  \"manhelper,\" a\r\n\nlong wooden pole with a  metallic tip, designed to connect to\r\n\na paint  roller to  increase a painter's  reach.   Inside the\r\n\npaint trailer,  another seaman named Serephine  Rodrigues was\r\n\nresponsible for distributing  tools and mixing paint  for use\r\n\nin maintenance tasks.  Costa  asked Rodrigues to mix him some\r\n\nepoxy paint; Rodrigues refused, citing his instructions  that\r\n\nhe was only to issue oil-based paints.  A quarrel ensued, and\r\n\nRodrigues  eventually acceded  to Costa's  demands  and began\r\n\nmixing the epoxy paint.  \r\n\n     While  Rodrigues was at  work, Costa continued  to argue\r\n\nwith him.   At some  point, Rodrigues  became frustrated  and\r\n\ntold Costa to \"leave  me alone\" and \"get  back in the  boat.\"\r\n\nRodrigues also threw a light rag, which hit Costa in the head\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nand slipped  off.  Costa  swung the manhelper back  with both\r\n\nhands and then forward in Rodrigues's direction.   \r\n\n     Prior to this moment, Ford had approached the trailer to\r\n\nreturn some  tools.  While  inside the trailer, he  heard the\r\n\naltercation escalate and  \"knew something was going  to pop.\"\r\n\nFord  emerged  from the  trailer  just  as  Costa  swung  the\r\n\nmanhelper at Rodrigues.  The manhelper struck Ford in the hip\r\n\nand then  glanced off Rodrigues's hand, which had been raised\r\n\nto ward off  the blow.   Ford has been seriously  disabled by\r\n\nthe resulting injury.\r\n\n     Ford sued the Steamship Authority in the district court,\r\n\nalleging  negligence under  the Jones Act,  46 U.S.C.    688,\r\n\nunseaworthiness, and an entitlement  to maintenance and  cure\r\n\nunder general  maritime law.1   On October  28, 1996,  a jury\r\n\nawarded  Ford  $740,000 for  negligence  and unseaworthiness,\r\n\nprejudgment interest at  a rate of 6%  (totaling $57,172.60),\r\n\nand  $23,000 for  maintenance and  cure.  The  district court\r\n\nentered judgment on the  verdict on November 26,  and amended\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1Both parties  assume that  the latter  two claims  fall\r\nunder the admiralty  jurisdiction of the federal  courts.  It\r\nis not entirely clear that  they satisfy the \"location  test\"\r\nof admiralty jurisdiction, namely, that the  injury \"occurred\r\non  navigable water  or .  . .  injury  suffered on  land was\r\ncaused by a  vessel on navigable water.\"   Jerome B. Grubart,\r                                                                         \r\nInc. v.  Great Lakes  Dredge &amp;  Dock Co.,  513 U.S.  527, 534\r                                                    \r\n(1995).   But  Ford's  claim  under the  Jones  Act  provides\r\nfederal  question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.   1331, so the\r\nother claims  fall within  the court's pendent  jurisdiction.\r\nSee  Romero v. International Terminal Operating Co., 358 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n354, 380-81 (1959).\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nthe  judgment on May  1, 1997, after  the Steamship Authority\r\n\npointed out a mathematical error.  \r\n\n     The  Steamship  Authority  now  appeals  the verdict  of\r\n\nunseaworthiness  and  negligence.    At  oral  argument,  the\r\n\nSteamship Authority correctly  conceded that the  verdict may\r\n\nbe reversed only if the  jury could not reasonably have found\r\n\nfor Ford  on either theory.  Because we find that the verdict\r\n\nof unseaworthiness  is supported  by the  record,  we do  not\r\n\naddress the issue of Jones Act negligence, which involves the\r\n\nseparate question  whether  the Steamship  Authority  was  on\r\n\nnotice of Costa's proclivity for violence.\r\n\n     It is common ground that a vessel owner may be found  in\r\n\nbreach  of the  warranty of  seaworthiness if  one seaman  is\r\n\nassaulted by another.   Boudoin v. Lykes Bros.  S.S. Co., 348\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 336, 338-39  (1955).  The  decisive question is  whether\r\n\nthe  assaulting  seaman   was  \"equal   in  disposition   and\r\n\nseamanship  to the ordinary men in  the calling.\"  Id. at 338\r                                                                  \r\n\n(quoting Keen v. Overseas  Tankship Corp., 194 F.2d  515, 518\r                                                     \r\n\n(2d Cir. 1952)).  Our limited  task on appeal is to determine\r\n\nwhether Ford  presented enough  evidence so  that a  rational\r\n\njury could conclude that Costa was worse in disposition  than\r\n\nthe ordinary seaman.\r\n\n     No  one factor is  conclusive in determining  whether an\r\n\nassailant's disposition is  substandard.  We have held that a\r\n\nplaintiff may carry  his burden of proof in  two ways: either\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nby  showing  that  the particular  assault  on  the plaintiff\r\n\ninvolved a dangerous  weapon, or by adducing  evidence of the\r\n\nassailant's \"quarrelsome  nature\"  in general.   Connolly  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nFarrell Lines, Inc., 268 F.2d 653, 656 (1st Cir. 1959).  Ford\r                               \r\n\npresented evidence of both.  There is little doubt that Costa\r\n\nhit Ford with a dangerous weapon, namely, a thick wooden pole\r\n\nfive or six feet long and tipped with metal.  The  jury heard\r\n\ntestimony stating  that Costa was specifically  attempting to\r\n\nhit Rodrigues,  that he  swung with both  hands, and  did not\r\n\ncheck his swing.  Rodrigues  also testified that his head was\r\n\nat the same height as the point  where Ford's hip was struck.\r\n\nWe do  not think the  jury would be irrational  in concluding\r\n\nthat  this was  a  particularly  violent  act  that  revealed\r\n\nCosta's  disposition  to  be  unequal  to  that  of  ordinary\r\n\nsailors.\r\n\n     The jury  also heard  evidence of  Costa's penchant  for\r\n\nviolence on other occasions.   Other seamen testified to  two\r\n\nphysical fights that Costa  had instigated.  Costa  also once\r\n\nstated that  he would  kill another  crewmember, although  no\r\n\nviolence  ensued.    A Steamship  Authority  captain  who had\r\n\nworked with  Costa testified that Costa had  a reputation for\r\n\nbelligerence.     The  Steamship  Authority   countered  this\r\n\nevidence at  trial and  still disputes it,  but the  jury was\r\n\nentitled  to accept  the version  of the  facts  favorable to\r\n\nFord.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     Ford argues  that the appropriate comparison  of Costa's\r\n\ndisposition  is not with ordinary sailors generally, but with\r\n\nordinary  sailors employed by  the Steamship  Authority, whom\r\n\nFord says are a  pacific and docile group.   Because it would\r\n\nnot affect the outcome, we leave resolution of this issue for\r\n\nanother  day.    Ford also  cross-appeals  on  two procedural\r\n\nissues  regarding,  respectively, the  Steamship  Authority's\r\n\nfailure to renew  its motion for judgment as a  matter of law\r\n\nand untimely  filing of its notice of  appeal.  Both are moot\r\n\nin light of our ruling on the merits.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n",

At  oral  argument,  the\r\n\nSteamship Authority correctly  conceded that the  verdict may\r\n\nbe reversed only if the  jury could not reasonably have found\r\n\nfor Ford  on either theory.  Because we find that the verdict\r\n\nof unseaworthiness  is supported  by the  record,  we do  not\r\n\naddress the issue of Jones Act negligence, which involves the\r\n\nseparate question  whether  the Steamship  Authority  was  on\r\n\nnotice of Costa's proclivity for violence.\r\n\n     It is common ground that a vessel owner may be found  in\r\n\nbreach  of the  warranty of  seaworthiness if  one seaman  is\r\n\nassaulted by another.

Our limited  task on appeal is to determine\r\n\nwhether Ford  presented enough  evidence so  that a  rational\r\n\njury could conclude that Costa was worse in disposition  than\r\n\nthe ordinary seaman.\r\n\n     No  one factor is  conclusive in determining  whether an\r\n\nassailant's disposition is  substandard.  We have held that a\r\n\nplaintiff may carry  his burden of proof in  two ways: either\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nby  showing  that  the particular  assault  on  the plaintiff\r\n\ninvolved a dangerous  weapon, or by adducing  evidence of the\r\n\nassailant's \"quarrelsome  nature\"  in general.

Ford\r                               \r\n\npresented evidence of both.  There is little doubt that Costa\r\n\nhit Ford with a dangerous weapon, namely, a thick wooden pole\r\n\nfive or six feet long and tipped with metal.  The  jury heard\r\n\ntestimony stating  that Costa was specifically  attempting to\r\n\nhit Rodrigues,  that he  swung with both  hands, and  did not\r\n\ncheck his swing.  Rodrigues  also testified that his head was\r\n\nat the same height as the point  where Ford's hip was struck.\r\n\nWe do  not think the  jury would be irrational  in concluding\r\n\nthat  this was  a  particularly  violent  act  that  revealed\r\n\nCosta's  disposition  to  be  unequal  to  that  of  ordinary\r\n\nsailors.\r\n\n     The jury  also heard  evidence of  Costa's penchant  for\r\n\nviolence on other occasions.   Other seamen testified to  two\r\n\nphysical fights that Costa  had instigated.  Costa  also once\r\n\nstated that  he would  kill another  crewmember, although  no\r\n\nviolence  ensued.    A Steamship  Authority  captain  who had\r\n\nworked with  Costa testified that Costa had  a reputation for\r\n\nbelligerence.     The  Steamship  Authority   countered  this\r\n\nevidence at  trial and  still disputes it,  but the  jury was\r\n\nentitled  to accept  the version  of the  facts  favorable to\r\n\nFord.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\n     Ford argues  that the appropriate comparison  of Costa's\r\n\ndisposition  is not with ordinary sailors generally, but with\r\n\nordinary  sailors employed by  the Steamship  Authority, whom\r\n\nFord says are a  pacific and docile group.   Because it would\r\n\nnot affect the outcome, we leave resolution of this issue for\r\n\nanother  day.    Ford also  cross-appeals  on  two procedural\r\n\nissues  regarding,  respectively, the  Steamship  Authority's\r\n\nfailure to renew  its motion for judgment as a  matter of law\r\n\nand untimely  filing of its notice of  appeal.  Both are moot\r\n\nin light of our ruling on the merits.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n</pre>",
