We affirm.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          A.  Facts\r                               \r\n\n          Petitioner   is   a  certified   flight  instructor\r\n\nemployed   by  a   fixed  base   operator  at   the  Beverly,\r\n\nMassachusetts  airport.   In  addition to  flight instruction\r\n\nduties,  she flies  a daily  morning Metro  Traffic Reporting\r\n\nflight.   On the day  in question, she  performed her regular\r\n\ntraffic flight.   Later that morning, her  employer asked her\r\n\nto   make  a   ferry  flight   to  Lawrence,   Massachusetts,\r\n\napproximately  twelve miles  northwest,  in a  plane she  had\r\n\nnever operated.   Petitioner did not hesitate because she was\r\n\n\"just  used to going up  [t]here and not  having any problems\r\n\n. . . .\"\r\n\n          Shortly   after   her   departure   from   Beverly,\r\n\npetitioner contacted Lawrence Automatic  Terminal Information\r\n\nService  (\"ATIS\")  and  was  informed that  the  weather  was\r\n\nsuitable for flying  under Visual Flight  Rules (\"VFR\").1   A\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Visual Flight Rules, see 14 C.F.R.     91.151-159, govern\r                                        \r\nprocedures  for flight in \"VFR\" conditions.   In general, VFR\r\nconditions are those where the pilot can see minimum required\r\ndistances and utilize visual navigation techniques.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nfew minutes later, she tried to  contact Lawrence Air Traffic\r\n\nControl (\"ATC\") and found  both radios inoperative.  At about\r\n\nthe same time,  she noticed snow showers to the  north in the\r\n\ndirection of  Lawrence airport.  Unable to  make contact with\r\n\nLawrence ATC she ultimately turned away from the weather.\r\n\n          It appears  that at this point  petitioner had lost\r\n\ntrack  of  where she  was.   Instead  of heading  back toward\r\n\nBeverly,  she  testified  that  she \"didn't  know  the  exact\r\n\nheading [she] took but it  must have been a heading of  south\r\n\n. . . .\"    While on  this  southerly  heading, she  steadily\r\n\ndescended,  watched for  traffic,  worked on  her radios  and\r\n\ntried to \"calm\" herself.\r\n\n          Petitioner  eventually  managed to  establish radio\r\n\ncontact  with Lawrence ATC and was \"shocked\" to learn she was\r\n\ntwenty  miles  south of  her intended  flight  path --  at an\r\n\nelevation of  only  700  feet, three  miles  north  of  Logan\r\n\nAirport  --  thus  flying  in Class  B  controlled  airspace2\r\n\nwithout  authorization.  At the urgent request of a Logan air\r\n\ntraffic   controller,  Lawrence  ATC  radioed  petitioner  to\r\n\ncontact Logan ATC  which then provided her with  vectors back\r\n\nto Lawrence.   As a  result of this  unauthorized foray  into\r\n\nClass B air space, Logan controllers were forced to shut down\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Class   B  controlled  airspace  surrounds  the  nation's\r\nbusiest airports.   It generally  ranges from the  surface to\r\naltitudes as  high as  10,000 feet and  requires Air  Traffic\r\nControl clearance before entry.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nrunways, delay departing flights and  divert arriving flights\r\n\non  final approach.  The written record does not reflect that\r\n\npetitioner ever informed Lawrence ATC or Logan controllers of\r\n\nher radio problems.3\r\n\n          After landing at Lawrence, petitioner contacted the\r\n\nBoston  Terminal  Radar   Approach  Control  (\"TRACON\")  Area\r\n\nManager.  When asked what happened, she replied:\r\n\n               I   got   kind  of   discombobulated\r\n          because I  entered a snow shower and none\r\n          of my radios seemed to be working.  I was\r\n          getting  wrong  information  . . . I  ran\r\n          into a  little bit of  difficulty . . . I\r\n          got  disoriented.   I have  an instrument\r\n          rating . . . [b]ut I'm not  current . . .\r\n          I'm    actually   a    certified   flight\r\n          instructor  and this  is  the scary  part\r\n          . . . I just . . . got disoriented  and I\r\n          guess I thought I  knew where I was going\r\n          and then  when I found out  that I didn't\r\n          have the runway or  airport in sight then\r\n          I knew  I had  a problem . . .  if anyone\r\n          had told me it would happen to me I would\r\n          never  [have]  believed   it  . . .   I'm\r\n          probably going to be in very big trouble.\r\n\nThree weeks  later, petitioner submitted a  written report to\r\n\nthe Logan  FAA Flight  Standards Field  Office  in which  she\r\n\nacknowledged  that \"perhaps  [she]  could have  done more  to\r\n\nprevent incurring Boston's airspace.\"   With the burden being\r\n\non her, this was an understatement.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Petitioner  did  testify that  after making  contact with\r\nLawrence  Air  Traffic  Control,   she  reported  her   radio\r\nproblems.  She also testified that she told Logan controllers\r\nof her avionics difficulties.  However, neither transcript of\r\ntapes  routinely  kept  by  both  authorities  contained  any\r\nconfirmation of this.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n          B.  Procedural History\r                                            \r\n\n          On March 29, 1994, the FAA issued the final amended\r\n\norder suspending petitioner's  commercial pilot  certificate.\r\n\nThe  order found  petitioner  guilty of  three violations  of\r\n\nFederal  Aviation Regulations  (\"FAR\"), 14  C.F.R.     1.1 et\r                                                                         \r\n\nseq.    Specifically,  she  was charged  with  operating  her\r                \r\n\naircraft within  Class B airspace without  authorization, see\r                                                                         \r\n\n14 C.F.R.   91.131(a)(1), and over a congested area of a city\r\n\nbelow  an altitude of 1,000 feet.  See 14 C.F.R.   91.119(b).\r                                                  \r\n\nShe was  also charged with operating  her aircraft carelessly\r\n\nor  recklessly  so as  to endanger  the  life or  property of\r\n\nanother.  See 14 C.F.R.   91.13(a).\r                         \r\n\n          Petitioner  filed  a  notice  of  appeal  with  the\r\n\nNational Transportation Safety Board (\"NTSB\"), pursuant to 49\r\n\nC.F.R. Part 821, Subpart I.  A hearing was held on August 29,\r\n\n1995,  before  an  Administrative  Law  Judge   (\"ALJ\"),  who\r\n\naffirmed the  FAA  order in  its entirety.   Petitioner  then\r\n\nfiled a notice of appeal with the full NTSB which denied  the\r\n\nappeal and upheld the  ALJ's decision.  We  have jurisdiction\r\n\nunder 49 U.S.C.   1153.\r\n\n                        II.

Safety Bd.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n821  F.2d 63, 67 n.5 (1st Cir. 1987); 49 U.S.C.   1153(b)(3),\r\n\nwhile reviewing questions of law de novo.\r\n\n          Petitioner  does not  dispute  that  she  committed\r\n\nmultiple FAR violations,  maintaining, instead, that she  was\r\n\nexcused from  compliance  under 14  C.F.R.    91.3(b),  which\r\n\nprovides  that   \"[i]n  an  in   flight  emergency  requiring\r\n\nimmediate action, the  pilot in command may deviate  from any\r\n\nrule  of  this  part to  the  extent  required  to meet  that\r\n\nemergency.\"  The NTSB and the ALJ considered this affirmative\r\n\ndefense and  rejected its  application because  the emergency\r\n\nwas  of petitioner's  own  making.   We  agree.   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nChritton v. Nat'l Transp. Safety Bd., 888 F.2d 854, 861 (D.C.\r                                                \r\n\nCir.   1989)   (emergency   defense   rejected   where  pilot\r\n\nencountered  deteriorating weather  conditions and  failed to\r\n\nexecute  a 180 degree turn).  It  is beyond dispute that upon\r\n\nencountering  snow  showers  in her  path,  petitioner  could\r\n\nsimply have  turned around  and returned to  Beverly airport.\r\n\nInstead, she panicked and blundered into classified airspace,\r\n\nendangering many lives, including her own.\r\n\n          Petitioner   contends   that   contrary    to   the\r\n\nrequirements of the APA, the ALJ's decision did not contain a\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n\"recitation of factual evidence\"  nor \"an analysis thereof to\r\n\nsupport  the  ultimate findings  of  fact  which support  the\r\n\nconclusions  of law.\"    See 5  U.S.C.    557(c).   The  ALJ,\r                                        \r\n\nhowever, specifically found that petitioner was \"confused and\r\n\ndisoriented\" and stated:\r\n\n          [I]f   there   was   an    emergency   --\r\n          Respondent's  counsel  says there  was an\r\n          emergency --  it was an emergency  of her\r\n          own making and  she certainly didn't tell\r\n          anyone during, before or  afterwards that\r\n          such an  emergency existed . . . I do not\r\n          find there  was an emergency,  really, as\r\n          such on the part of the pilot.\r\n\nWhile this  passage  is  not  included in  the  ALJ's  formal\r\n\nrecitation of  findings of  fact and  conclusions of law,  we\r\n\nfind it to be adequately articulated and providing sufficient\r\n\nsupport for the rejection of the emergency defense.\r\n\n          Petitioner  also maintains  that  the  findings  of\r\n\nmaterial fact  by the  ALJ and  upheld  by the  NTSB are  not\r\n\nsupported by substantial evidence  as required under 5 U.S.C.\r\n\n  706(2)(E).  Substantial evidence is \"such relevant evidence\r\n\nas  a reasonable mind might  accept as adequate  to support a\r\n\nconclusion.\"  Chritton, 888  F.2d at 856 (citations omitted).\r                                  \r\n\nUnder the  substantial evidence test,  we \"determine  whether\r\n\nthe agency . . . could fairly  and reasonably find the  facts\r\n\nas  it did.\"  Id. (citations omitted).  \"An agency conclusion\r                             \r\n\nmay  be  supported  by  substantial evidence  even  though  a\r\n\nplausible  alternative interpretation  of the  evidence would\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nsupport  a contrary  view.\"   Throckmorton  v. Nat'l  Transp.\r                                                                         \r\n\nSafetyBd., 963F.2d 441,444 (D.C.Cir. 1992)(citation omitted).\r                     \r\n\n          After a  close review of  the record, we  hold that\r\n\nthe  findings  of  the   ALJ  are  supported  by  substantial\r\n\nevidence.  First,  as regards the rejection  of the emergency\r\n\ndefense,  there   was  testimony  by  an   FAA  expert  which\r\n\nestablished that petitioner should  not have attempted to fix\r\n\nher  radios if  doing so  would result  in a  loss  of ground\r\n\nreference  points.   Radios  are  not  required for  aircraft\r\n\nflying  in  VFR conditions  during the  day.   See  14 C.F.R.\r                                                              \r\n\n  91.205(b).   Moreover, the  expert  witness testified  that\r\n\neven if  petitioner had  lost sight  of her  ground reference\r\n\npoints and  therefore could not engage  in \"dead reckoning,\"4\r\n\nshe  still had use of her magnetic compass or her directional\r\n\ngyroscope  which would have alerted her  that she was turning\r\n\nsouth toward Logan.\r\n\n          Substantial  evidence  supports  the  threshold  of\r\n\nfindings  of FAR  violations.   Petitioner  in her  testimony\r\n\nadmitted  her ultimate  conclusion  that  she  \"was  probably\r\n\nheaded south while . . .  trying to fix the radio,\"  that she\r\n\nwas \"probably\" within  three miles of Logan  when contact was\r\n\nmade and that she  \"kept descending thinking it was  going to\r\n\nget better.\"   She should  have known immediately.   Although\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  \"Dead  reckoning\" is  a  basic navigational  method using\r\ncompass, time, distance and headings.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nshe  couldn't  remember going  as low  as  700 feet,  the FAA\r\n\nintroduced a radar plot confirming the low altitude.  We need\r\n\ngo no further.  The decision of the NTSB is affirmed.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n",

Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner is a certified flight instructor employed by a fixed base operator at the Beverly, Massachusetts airport.  In addition to flight instruction duties, she flies a daily morning Metro Traffic Reporting flight.  On the day in question, she performed her regular traffic flight.  Later that morning, her employer asked her to make a ferry flight to Lawrence, Massachusetts, approximately twelve miles northwest, in a plane she had never operated.  Petitioner did not hesitate because she was \"just used to going up [t]here and not having any problems....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after her departure from Beverly, petitioner contacted Lawrence Automatic Terminal Information Service (\"ATIS\") and was informed that the weather was suitable for flying under Visual Flight Rules (\"VFR\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  A few minutes later, she tried to contact Lawrence Air Traffic Control (\"ATC\") and found both radios inoperative.

At the urgent request of a Logan air traffic controller, Lawrence ATC radioed petitioner to contact Logan ATC which then provided her with vectors back to Lawrence.  As a result of this unauthorized foray into Class B air space, Logan controllers were forced to shut down runways, delay departing flights and divert arriving flights on final approach.

Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 29, 1994, the FAA issued the final amended order suspending petitioner's commercial pilot certificate.  The order found petitioner guilty of three violations of Federal Aviation Regulations (\"FAR\"), 14 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 1.1 et seq.   Specifically, she was charged with operating her aircraft within Class B airspace without authorization, see 14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.131(a)(1), and over a congested area of a city below an altitude of 1,000 feet.  See 14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.119(b).  She was also charged with operating her aircraft carelessly or recklessly so as to endanger the life or property of another.

Part 821, Subpart I.  A hearing was held on August 29, 1995, before an Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\"), who affirmed the FAA order in its entirety.  Petitioner then filed a notice of appeal with the full NTSB which denied the appeal and upheld the ALJ's decision.  We have jurisdiction under 49 U.S.C. &#167; 1153.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Hinson, 48 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.1995), affirming unless the decision was \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.\"  Id. (citation omitted).  We accept factual conclusions by the NTSB if they are supported by substantial evidence, Twomey v. Nat'l Transp.

We agree.  See, e.g., Chritton v. Nat'l Transp.  Safety Bd., 888 F.2d 854, 861 (D.C.Cir.1989) (emergency defense rejected where pilot encountered deteriorating weather conditions and failed to execute a 180 degree turn).  It is beyond dispute that upon encountering snow showers in her path, petitioner could simply have turned around and returned to Beverly airport.  Instead, she panicked and blundered into classified airspace, endangering many lives, including her own.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner contends that contrary to the requirements of the APA, the ALJ's decision did not contain a \"recitation of factual evidence\" nor \"an analysis thereof to support the ultimate findings of fact which support the conclusions of law.\"   See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 557(c).  The ALJ, however, specifically found that petitioner was \"confused and disoriented\" and stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>[I]f there was an emergency--Respondent's counsel says there was an emergency--it was an emergency of her own making and she certainly didn't tell anyone during, before or afterwards that such an emergency existed ...

Substantial evidence is \"such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"  Chritton, 888 F.2d at 856 (citations omitted).  Under the substantial evidence test, we \"determine whether the agency ... could fairly and reasonably find the facts as it did.\"  Id. (citations omitted).  \"An agency conclusion may be supported by substantial evidence even though a plausible alternative interpretation of the evidence would support a contrary view.\"  Throckmorton v.

First, as regards the rejection of the emergency defense, there was testimony by an FAA expert which established that petitioner should not have attempted to fix her radios if doing so would result in a loss of ground reference points.  Radios are not required for aircraft flying in VFR conditions during the day.  See 14 C.F.R. &#167; 91.205(b).  Moreover, the expert witness testified that even if petitioner had lost sight of her ground reference points and therefore could not engage in \"dead reckoning,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> she still had use of her magnetic compass or her directional gyroscope which would have alerted her that she was turning south toward Logan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Substantial evidence supports the threshold of findings of FAR violations.  Petitioner in her testimony admitted her ultimate conclusion that she \"was probably headed south while ... trying to fix the radio,\" that she was \"probably\" within three miles of Logan when contact was made and that she \"kept descending thinking it was going to get better.\"   She should have known immediately.  Although she couldn't remember going as low as 700 feet, the FAA introduced a radar plot confirming the low altitude.  We need go no further.  The decision of the NTSB is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Visual Flight Rules, see 14 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 91.151-159, govern procedures for flight in \"VFR\" conditions.
