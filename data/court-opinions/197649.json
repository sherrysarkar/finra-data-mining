In  February 1992, claimant Thomas  Boothby\r\n\nfiled  a  pro  se  application  for  SSI  benefits,  alleging\r\n\ndisability on account of alcoholism and depression.  When his\r\n\napplication was denied at the administrative level,  claimant\r\n\nfailed  to seek  further review.   In  September 1993,  after\r\n\nsuffering a heart attack, he filed a second such  application\r\n\nand, with the assistance  of counsel, was eventually  awarded\r\n\nbenefits pursuant thereto.   The ALJ rejected his request  to\r\n\nreopen  the first  application,  however,  finding  that  new\r\n\nevidence \r                    documenting \r                               his \r                                   mental impairments failed to establish\r\n\n\"good cause\" for doing so.  See 20 C.F.R. S 416.1488.   After\r\n\nthe \r               Appeals \r                      Council \r                              declined review, claimant filed this action\r\n\nin district  court challenging  the denial  of his  reopening\r\n\nrequest.   From a  judgment dismissing the  suit for lack  of\r\n\njurisdiction, he now appeals.  \r\n\n     The denial  of a request  to reopen  an application  for\r\n\ndisability benefits is  ordinarily not reviewable in  federal\r\n\ncourt.  See, e.g.,  Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99,  107-09\r\n\n(1977); Colon v. Secretary of HHS, 877 F.2d 148, 152-53  (1st\r\n\nCir. 1989)  (per curiam).  An  exception to this rule  exists\r\n\nwhere a colorable  constitutional claim  has been  presented.\r\n\nSee\r              , \r                e.g.\r                    , \r                      Sa\r                        nders, 430 U.S. at 109; Dvareckas v.

Claimant\r\n\nhas attempted  to advance  such a  claim here--arguing  that,\r\n\nbecause \r                   his \r                      mental \r                             impairments prevented him from understanding\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nand \r               pursuing \r                       his \r                           administrative remedies, and because he lacked\r\n\nlegal                                                       o\r\n\nreopen \r                  the \r                      first application contravened due process.  Such an\r\n\nargument, when factually  supported, has  gained a  favorable\r\n\njudicial \r                    reception. \r                               \r                               See\r                                  ,\r                                    e.g., Evans v. Chater, 110 F.3d 1480,\r\n\n1482-83 (9th Cir. 1997) (listing cases); Parker v.  Califano,\r\n\n644                                   Torres\r                  or  other representation at  the time,  the refusal  t\r                F.2d 1199, 1203  (6th Cir. 1981);        v.

As\r\n\none \r               court \r                     has \r                        observed, \r                                  \"It offends fundamental fairness ... to\r\n\nbind \r                a \r                  claimant to an adverse ruling who lacks both the mental\r\n\ncompetency and the legal assistance necessary to contest  the\r\n\ninitial \r                   determination.\" \r                                   \r                                   Young v. Bowen, 858 F.2d 951, 955 (4th\r\n\nCir. 1988).1\r\n\n   1  Inexplicably, claimant made no mention of the due\r\nprocess issue in his complaint or in his \"itemized statement\"\r\n(although he did there refer to the analogous SSR 91-5p). \r\nThe first written reference thereto appears in his objections\r\nto the magistrate-judge's report; it is unclear whether the\r\nissue was earlier raised at oral argument.  Any claim not\r\npresented to the magistrate-judge would be waived.  See,\r\ne.g., Borden v. Secretary of HHS, 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir.\r\n1987).  Yet because the Commissioner has not argued that any\r\nsuch waiver occurred, we need not pursue the matter. \r\nSimilarly, because the Commissioner has not contended that\r\nthe constitutional claim was subject to the administrative\r\nexhaustion requirement, we need not address the issue.  See,\r\ne.g., Shrader v. Harris, 631 F.2d 297, 300 (4th Cir. 1980)\r\n(excusing failure to present due process issue to Secretary).\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n     On appeal, the Commissioner does not take serious  issu\r\n\n            opositions.   Instead, he argues that the medical\r\n\n          falls  short  of  \"definitively  establishing  tha\r                                                                        e\r            with \r                these \r                      pr           2\r            evidence                                                    t\r\n\nplaintiff was unfit  to pursue  the remaining  administrative\r\n\nremedies.\"  Brief  at 12.  Yet  the relevant inquiry here  is\r\n\nwhether  a  \"colorable\"   due  process  violation  has   been\r\n\ndemonstrated.  This is  not an onerous standard.  See,  e.g.,\r\n\nEvans\r                , \r                  110 \r                      F.3d \r                          at \r                             1483 \r                                  (noting that \"plaintiff whose challenge\r\n\nwas \r               not \r                  'wholly \r                          insubstantial, immaterial, or frivolous' stated\r\n\na colorable  constitutional  claim\")  (quoting  Boettcher  v.\r\n\nSecretary \r                     of \r                        HHS, 759 F.2d 719, 722 (9th Cir. 1995)); Boock v.\r\n\nShalala\r                  , \r                    48 \r                      F.3d \r                           348, \r                                353 (8th Cir. 1995) (indicating that only\r\n\nthose claims  that were \"patently  frivolous\" would \"fail  to\r\n\nconfer jurisdiction upon the district court\") (Campbell,  J.,\r\n\nsitting by designation).\r\n\n     Upon review of the evidence here, we find that  claimant\r\n\nhas presented  a colorable due  process claim.   Dr.  Doiron,\r\n\nalthough \r                    reporting well after the events in question, spoke of\r\n\nan organic  disorder  with significantly  compromised  mental\r\n\nfunctions, variable  attention span,  impaired  concentration\r\n\n   2  The Commissioner does assert at one point, without\r\nelaboration, that \"the alleged constitutional deprivation\r\nmust concern the proceeding at which the determination not to\r\nreopen was made.\"  Brief at 10 (citing Cherry v. Heckler, 760\r\nF.2d 1186, 1190 n.4 (11th Cir. 1985)).  Yet other courts have\r\ntaken a broader view of the Sanders exception, see, e.g.,\r\nEvans, 110 F.3d at 1482-83, which we regard as the preferable\r\napproach.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nlevels,  depressive  symptomology  and  substandard   reading\r\n\n      y.3   And  even Dr.  Luongo, on  whom the  Commissioner\r\n\nrelies, spoke of an emotionally unstable personality disorder\r\n\nwith strong sociopathic and alcoholic features, a borderline-\r\n\ndefective intellect, a chronic difficulty in maintaining  any\r\n\nleve\r            abilit\r                l of  responsibility, and an  inability to handle  funds.\r\n\nFactfinding \r                       is \r                          of \r                            course \r                                   the function of the agency rather than\r\n\na court.  See, e.g., Torres, 475 F.2d at 469.  We hold simply\r\n\nthat the evidence of mental incapacity in 1992, when claimant\r\n\nfailed \r                  to \r                     pursue his administrative remedies, is sufficient to\r\n\nwarrant further inquiry by the Commissioner.\r\n\n     Because the due process inquiry involves a fact-specific\r\n\njudgment \r                    in \r                       evaluating medical evidence, we remand the case so\r\n\nthe Commissioner can make this judgment as an initial  matter\r\n\nand--if satisfied that  there was a  denial of due  process--\r\n\naddress the merits.   This procedure is consistent with  past\r\n\npractice \r                    in \r                       earlier cases.  We think it worth emphasizing that\r\n\nthis remand turns on whether claimant has made a  \"colorable\"\r\n\ndue process  claim.  Nothing in  this opinion is designed  to\r\n\nsuggest that the Commissioner should necessarily find that  a\r\n\nviolation occurred.\r\n\n   3  The Commissioner has not objected to consideration of\r\nthe second Doiron report, which was first presented to the\r\nAppeals Council.  See, e.g., Perez v. Chater, 77 F.3d 41, 44-\r\n45 (2d Cir. 1996) (following majority view that new evidence\r\nsubmitted to Appeals Council is properly deemed part of\r\nadministrative record, even when Council has denied review).\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n     We add that,  given claimant's failure to raise the  due\r\n\nprocess \r                   issue before the Commissioner, and given his tardiness\r\n\nin presenting that issue squarely to the district court,  see\r\n\nnote 1 supra, any  request for attorney's fees in this  court\r\n\nwould be looked upon with disfavor. \r\n\n     The judgment  is vacated and  the case  remanded to  the\r\n\ndistrict court, with directions to remand to the Commissioner\r\n\nfor further action consistent herewith.  No costs.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\n",

Yet because the Commissioner has not argued that any\r\nsuch waiver occurred, we need not pursue the matter. \r\nSimilarly, because the Commissioner has not contended that\r\nthe constitutional claim was subject to the administrative\r\nexhaustion requirement, we need not address the issue.

Yet  the relevant inquiry here  is\r\n\nwhether  a  \"colorable\"   due  process  violation  has   been\r\n\ndemonstrated.  This is  not an onerous standard.

Dr.  Doiron,\r\n\nalthough \r                    reporting well after the events in question, spoke of\r\n\nan organic  disorder  with significantly  compromised  mental\r\n\nfunctions, variable  attention span,  impaired  concentration\r\n\n   2  The Commissioner does assert at one point, without\r\nelaboration, that \"the alleged constitutional deprivation\r\nmust concern the proceeding at which the determination not to\r\nreopen was made.\"  Brief at 10 (citing Cherry v.

Yet other courts have\r\ntaken a broader view of the Sanders exception, see, e.g.,\r\nEvans, 110 F.3d at 1482-83, which we regard as the preferable\r\napproach.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nlevels,  depressive  symptomology  and  substandard   reading\r\n\n      y.3   And  even Dr.  Luongo, on  whom the  Commissioner\r\n\nrelies, spoke of an emotionally unstable personality disorder\r\n\nwith strong sociopathic and alcoholic features, a borderline-\r\n\ndefective intellect, a chronic difficulty in maintaining  any\r\n\nleve\r            abilit\r                l of  responsibility, and an  inability to handle  funds.\r\n\nFactfinding \r                       is \r                          of \r                            course \r                                   the function of the agency rather than\r\n\na court.  See, e.g., Torres, 475 F.2d at 469.  We hold simply\r\n\nthat the evidence of mental incapacity in 1992, when claimant\r\n\nfailed \r                  to \r                     pursue his administrative remedies, is sufficient to\r\n\nwarrant further inquiry by the Commissioner.\r\n\n     Because the due process inquiry involves a fact-specific\r\n\njudgment \r                    in \r                       evaluating medical evidence, we remand the case so\r\n\nthe Commissioner can make this judgment as an initial  matter\r\n\nand--if satisfied that  there was a  denial of due  process--\r\n\naddress the merits.   This procedure is consistent with  past\r\n\npractice \r                    in \r                       earlier cases.  We think it worth emphasizing that\r\n\nthis remand turns on whether claimant has made a  \"colorable\"\r\n\ndue process  claim.  Nothing in  this opinion is designed  to\r\n\nsuggest that the Commissioner should necessarily find that  a\r\n\nviolation occurred.\r\n\n   3  The Commissioner has not objected to consideration of\r\nthe second Doiron report, which was first presented to the\r\nAppeals Council.  See, e.g., Perez v. Chater, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713043\"><a href=\"/opinion/713043/50-socsecrepser-236-unemplinsrep-cch-p-15119b-ramona-perez-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44-\r\n45 (2d Cir. 1996) (following majority view that new evidence\r\nsubmitted to Appeals Council is properly deemed part of\r\nadministrative record, even when Council has denied review).\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n     We add that,  given claimant's failure to raise the  due\r\n\nprocess \r                   issue before the Commissioner, and given his tardiness\r\n\nin presenting that issue squarely to the district court,  see\r\n\nnote 1 supra, any  request for attorney's fees in this  court\r\n\nwould be looked upon with disfavor. \r\n\n     The judgment  is vacated and  the case  remanded to  the\r\n\ndistrict court, with directions to remand to the Commissioner\r\n\nfor further action consistent herewith.
