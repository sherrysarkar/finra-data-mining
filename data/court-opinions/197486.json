Appellant  Robert Wagner,\r                                              \r\n\nformer chief of police in Holyoke, Massachusetts, claims that his\r\n\nFirst  Amendment freedom  of political  association was  violated\r\n\nwhen  members of  the city  council and  others subjected  him to\r\n\nsevere harassment, ultimately  forcing him to resign,  because of\r\n\nhis  political support  for  the  city's mayor.    He filed  this\r\n\nlawsuit  alleging federal  constitutional and state  law claims.1\r\n\nThe  district  court  dismissed the  First  Amendment  counts for\r\n\nfailure  to state a claim, and declined supplemental jurisdiction\r\n\nover the state law counts.   Because the First Amendment does not\r\n\nprotect  a policymaking official such as appellant from criticism\r\n\nand harassment, we affirm.\r\n\n                      I. Factual Background2\r                                                     \r\n\n     Appellant  Wagner was appointed Holyoke's chief of police in\r\n\nJuly 1991 by  then newly elected Mayor Hamilton.   Wagner asserts\r\n\nthat four  members  of  the  City  Council  who  were  Hamilton's\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1 The complaint  included a count for loss  of consortium on\r\nbehalf  of Wagner's  wife, Margaret  Wagner.  Because  this claim\r\nsurvives or  fails with Robert  Wagner's state claims, we  do not\r\naddress it separately. \r\n\n     2 We  note  that the  facts  alleged in  Wagner's  complaint\r\nprovide  a  much  sketchier picture  of  the  defendants' alleged\r\nconduct than  the facts  described by counsel  at the  hearing on\r\ndefendants' motion  to  dismiss.   In reviewing  a Rule  12(b)(6)\r\ndismissal,  we typically consider the \"well-pleaded facts as they\r\nappear  in  the  complaint,\" see  Correa-Martinez  v.  Arrillaga-\r                                                                           \r\nBelendez,  903 F.2d  49,  51 (1st  Cir.  1990) (emphasis  added).\r                  \r\nBecause  we ultimately uphold  the dismissal, and  the additional\r\nfacts are helpful in understanding the case, we draw the facts in\r\nthis  section from  both  the  complaint and  the  hearing.   For\r\npurposes of  the motion  to dismiss, we  take the  allegations as\r\ntrue  and  grant  all reasonable  inferences  in  Wagner's favor.\r\nAulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                             \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\npolitical opponents engaged  in a campaign of  harassment against\r\n\nhim  for  the  purpose  of  embarrassing  the  mayor and  forcing\r\n\nappellant to  resign.  He  contends that their criticisms  of his\r\n\njob  performance were  unfair  and  inaccurate,  and  that  their\r\n\nactions   were  motivated  solely  by  their  opposition  to  his\r\n\npolitical beliefs  and his political  support of the mayor.3   He\r\n\nfurther asserts  that  the president  of  the police  union,  and\r\n\nthrough  him the local  and international unions,  conspired with\r\n\nthe council members to effectuate the plan to oust him.\r\n\n     The complaint accuses  the council members of  harassing him\r\n\nby  means  of  unspecified  \"actions,\"  and  numerous  false  and\r\n\ndefamatory statements.  At the  hearing on the motion to dismiss,\r\n\nappellant's counsel identified the challenged actions as follows:\r\n\n     They   were  constantly  criticizing  him.    They  had\r\n     subcommittees  that they were chairing and they had him\r\n     up  to see the  council constantly, criticizing  him in\r\n     everything he did  . . . . They tried  to eliminate his\r\n     salary.   They reduced  his salary.   They reduced  his\r\n     benefits.  They  refused to fund  programs that he  was\r\n     pushing.\r\n\nAlthough the mayor  has sole authority under the  city charter to\r\n\nhire or  fire the police chief, the council  has power to set the\r\n\nsalary and benefits  for the position.  According  to Wagner, the\r\n\nfour defendant council members, aminority of the governing body, \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3  In his  appellate briefs,  Wagner  makes several  passing\r\nreferences to  a First Amendment violation based on his political\r\nspeech, as well as on political affiliation, and he cites several\r\nspeech cases  in support  of his arguments.   The  complaint, the\r\nhearing on  the  motion  to  dismiss, and  the  district  court's\r\nopinion all  reveal that this  case has been litigated  solely on\r\nthe theory that defendants harassed and constructively discharged\r\nhim based on his political beliefs and affiliation.  Our analysis\r\nis therefore confined to that context.        \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n\"led the charge\" against him and secured the complicity of enough\r\n\nother councilors to accomplish their unlawful objectives.\r\n\n     Wagner resigned in  September 1994.  He asserts  that he was\r\n\nforced  to do so  because the defendants'  actions and statements\r\n\nhindered,  undermined, and interfered with the performance of his\r\n\nduties, and thus constituted a constructive discharge.4\r\n\n     This  lawsuit followed.  In addition to federal civil rights\r\n\nclaims  under 42  U.S.C.    1983, which  assert violation  of his\r\n\nFirst  Amendment right to political association, Wagner alleged a\r\n\nstate civil rights violation, and state law claims of defamation,\r\n\ntortious  interference  with contractual  relations, and,  in his\r\n\nwife's name, loss of consortium.   In response to the defendants'\r\n\nmotion to  dismiss under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6),  the district\r\n\ncourt substantively  addressed only the  section 1983 count.   It\r\n\nruled that \"the alleged harassment which  Wagner sustained at the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4 Defendants contend that they  cannot be found liable for a\r\nconstructive discharge because  only the mayor had  the authority\r\nto fire  Wagner.  Their argument cuts too narrowly.  Although the\r\ncity council may not have had explicit authority to terminate the\r\npolice chief, its authority  to set salary, benefits and  working\r\nconditions  gave  it  the  power  to  accomplish  a  constructive\r\ndischarge. See, e.g., Vega v.  Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476,\r                                                              \r\n480  (1st Cir. 1993) (constructive discharge occurs when \"working\r\nconditions  [are] so intolerable[] that a reasonable person would\r\nfeel  compelled to  forsake  his  job rather  than  to submit  to\r\nlooming  indignities\"); Aviles-Martinez v. Monroig, 963 F.2d 2, 6\r                                                            \r\n(1st Cir. 1992) (similar).  Of course, a minority  of the council\r                                                           \r\ndoes not have such power, and a finding of constructive discharge\r\nwould require some  showing that the challenged  conduct actually\r\nwas  attributable to the  alleged discrimination.   See generally\r                                                                           \r\nScott-Harris v. City  of Fall River, Nos.  95-1950-1952, 95-2100,\r                                             \r\n1997  WL 9102, at  *9-10 (1st Cir.

Scott-Harris,  65 U.S.L.W. 3809 (U.S.  June 10,\r                                        \r\n1997) (No. 96-1569).  In any event,  as we conclude infra, such a\r                                                                   \r\ndischarge  would not  be  actionable if,  as  here, the  affected\r\nemployee was a policymaker.  \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nhands  of a  minority of  the city  councilors and  a subordinate\r\n\npolice  officer was  not  of sufficient  degree to  constitute 'a\r\n\nconstitutionally  significant  burden   on  [Wagner's]  political\r\n\nassociation right.'\"   Memorandum and Order at 5 (quoting Agosto-\r                                                                           \r\n\nde-Feliciano v.

Public employees who  hold such\r\n\npositions, the  court  ruled,  are not  protected  by  the  First\r\n\nAmendment from partisan attacks on their job performance.  Having\r\n\ndismissed  the federal  claims, the  court  declined to  exercise\r\n\nsupplemental  jurisdiction over the remaining state law causes of\r\n\naction and dismissed them as well.\r\n\n     The  Wagners then  filed this  appeal.   Our  review of  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's Rule  12(b)(6) dismissal is  de novo.   Romero-\r                                                                           \r\n\nBarcelo v.

Correa-Martinez v.  Arrillaga-\r                                                                           \r\n\nBelendez, 903  F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1990).  Because the district\r                  \r\n\ncourt's ruling that the  First Amendment does not  protect Wagner\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nfrom  politically motivated  discrimination is  both  correct and\r\n\ndispositive, we turn to that issue first.5\r\n\n                          II. Discussion\r                                                  \r\n\n     The Supreme  Court more  than twenty  years ago  established\r\n\nthat the First Amendment provides protection for public employees\r\n\nfrom  adverse job  action  based  solely  on  partisan  political\r\n\naffiliation.  See Elrod v.  Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976) (plurality\r                                           \r\n\nopinion);  Branti  v.  Finkel,  445 U.S.  507  (1980);  Rutan  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nRepublican Party,  497 U.S.  62 (1990).6   The protection  is not\r                          \r\n\nuniversal,  however.  In its precedent-setting case examining the\r\n\nconstitutionality of the  patronage system, the Court  recognized\r\n\nthe  competing First Amendment interest of the in-power political\r\n\nparty  \"to  insure   that  policies  which  the   electorate  has\r\n\nsanctioned  are effectively implemented,\" Elrod, 427 U.S. at 372.\r                                                         \r\n\nThe Court therefore  allowed patronage practices to  continue for\r\n\nthose  employees who, inter alia, make policy or occupy positions\r                                          \r\n\nof confidence.  Id.; Branti, 445 U.S. at 517-18.7\r                                     \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5 Wagner contends  that the district court's  other holding,\r\nthat   the  harassment  he   suffered  was  not  constitutionally\r\nsignificant, was based on a misreading of the complaint.  We need\r\nnot, and therefore do not, take up this issue.\r\n\n     6  The   Supreme  Court   addressed  politically   motivated\r\ndischarges in Elrod and Branti,  extending its reasoning to other\r                                        \r\nforms of employment discrimination in Rutan. \r                                                     \r\n\n     7  At  various points  in  this  opinion,  we use  the  term\r\n\"policymaker\" as a shorthand reference for the several categories\r\nof employees for whom partisan affiliation  is an appropriate job\r\ncriterion.   Such employees  are \"'involved in  policymaking, the\r\ncommunication of political  ideas, or  sensitive tasks  connected\r\nwith the policymaking function,' Vazquez Rios v. Hernandez Colon,\r                                                                          \r\n819 F.2d 319,  322 (1st Cir. 1987), []or 'occupy[] positions of .\r\n. . unusually intimate propinquity to government leaders,' id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n     Our circuit has since faced a long line of cases raising the\r\n\nissue  of political discrimination  in employment, most  of which\r\n\nhave  focused  on whether  the  particular position  held  by the\r\n\nplaintiff  employee fell inside  or outside the  First Amendment-\r\n\nprotected  sphere.  See,  e.g., Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1212 &amp; n.1, 1218 (noting \"first wave\" of cases involving outright\r\n\ndismissals,  and adopting  standard for evaluating  \"second wave\"\r\n\ncases   involving  discriminatory   conduct   falling  short   of\r\n\ndischarge).  This case presents an interesting departure from the\r\n\nnorm.   Both  parties accept  that Wagner's  job as  police chief\r\n\nsufficiently  elevated him in  the Holyoke hierarchy  that, under\r\n\nthe principles  we have just outlined, he could be fired based on\r\n\npolitical affiliation.  \r\n\n     Wagner,  however, contends  that  he  was  subjected  to  an\r\n\nimpermissible constructive  discharge because  only the mayor  --\r\n\nthe  official  who  hired  him  and  for  whom  he  served  as  a\r\n\npolicymaker  -- may  fire  him  based  on  political  affiliation\r\n\nwithout violating the First Amendment.  This is so, he maintains,\r\n\nbecause  the Elrod-Branti exception  was designed to  ensure that\r                                   \r\n\nthe  policies of  a new  administration  -- \"policies  presumably\r\n\nsanctioned by  the electorate,\" Elrod,  427 U.S. at 367  -- would\r                                               \r\n\nnot   be  undercut  by  the  obstructive  tactics  of  opposition\r\n\nincumbents.

That decision indicates  that the First Amendment protection\r\n\nagainst  patronage practices,  as  well  as  the  exceptions  for\r\n\ncertain categories  of highly  placed  employees, apply  whenever\r\n\npublic employees are at odds politically with their superiors and\r\n\nthus subject to politically discriminatory behaviors.\r\n\n     Our decision in Romero-Barcelo, 75 F.3d  at 33-34, brings us\r                                             \r\n\neven closer to the present context.

Wagner  was in  a  particularly  vulnerable position\r\n\nbecause of  the division of power over  his job between the mayor\r\n\nand city council, both  of whom possessed municipal  authority --\r\n\nalbeit  in different  ways --  to terminate  his employment.   At\r\n\nleast when  the political pressure  exerted by those in  power is\r\n\nwithin their  authority,8 the First Amendment does  not provide a\r\n\nshield for those whose positions are politically sensitive.\r\n\n     We   add   this   comment   about   appellant's   particular\r\n\ncircumstances.  Were appellant's argument to be accepted -- i.e.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nthat  harassment and criticism  by political opponents  rising to\r\n\nthe  level  of  a  constructive  discharge  constituted  a  First\r\n\nAmendment violation  -- we  quail at the  prospect of  judges and\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     8 There is no allegation, for example, that the city council\r\nlacked authority to reduce, or even eliminate, the police chief's\r\nsalary, or that improper procedures were followed. \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\njuries  being inundated  by claims  of  unhappy politicians  that\r\n\ntheir   opponents   had   transgressed   the   boundary   between\r\n\nconstitutional and unconstitutional fair play.  Partisan politics\r\n\ndoes not, we fear, lend itself  to the rulemaking authority of  a\r\n\nMarquess of Queensberry.\r\n\n     We therefore conclude that, because there is no dispute that\r\n\nappellant  Wagner's position as  police chief was  a policymaking\r\n\none,  the district  court  properly  held that  he  had no  First\r\n\nAmendment right to be free from discriminatory treatment based on\r\n\nhis politics.   This conclusion makes it  unnecessary to consider\r\n\nthe  other  issues   surrounding  his  First  Amendment   claims,\r\n\nincluding  the  adequacy   of  his  allegations,  the   scope  of\r\n\nlegislative immunity, and whether the allegedly improper  motives\r\n\nof  a four-member  minority  of  a  fifteen-member  city  council\r\n\nprovide a basis for municipal liability.

He filed this lawsuit alleging federal constitutional and state law claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court dismissed the First Amendment counts for failure to state a claim, and declined supplemental jurisdiction over the state law counts.  Because the First Amendment does not protect a policymaking official such as appellant from criticism and harassment, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Wagner was appointed Holyoke's chief of police in July 1991 by then newly elected Mayor Hamilton.  Wagner asserts that four members of the City Council who were Hamilton's political opponents engaged in a campaign of harassment against him for the purpose of embarrassing the mayor and forcing appellant to resign.  He contends that their criticisms of his job performance were unfair and inaccurate, and that their actions were motivated solely by their opposition to his political beliefs and his political support of the mayor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  He further asserts that the president of the police union, and through him the local and international unions, conspired with the council members to effectuate the plan to oust him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint accuses the council members of harassing him by means of unspecified \"actions,\" and numerous false and defamatory statements.  At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, appellant's counsel identified the challenged actions as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>They were constantly criticizing him.  They had subcommittees that they were chairing and they had him up to see the council constantly, criticizing him in everything he did....  They tried to eliminate his salary.  They reduced his salary. They reduced his benefits.  They refused to fund programs that he was pushing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the mayor has sole authority under the city charter to hire or fire the police chief, the council has power to set the salary and benefits for the position.  According to Wagner, the four defendant council members, a minority of the governing body, \"led the charge\" against him and secured the complicity of enough other councilors to accomplish their unlawful objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner resigned in September 1994.  He asserts that he was forced to do so because the defendants' actions and statements hindered, undermined, and interfered with the performance of his duties, and thus constituted a constructive discharge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lawsuit followed.  In addition to federal civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, which assert violation of his First Amendment right to political association, Wagner alleged a state civil rights violation, and state law claims of defamation, tortious interference with contractual relations, and, in his wife's name, loss of consortium.  In response to the defendants' motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the district court substantively addressed only the section 1983 count.  It ruled that \"the alleged harassment which Wagner sustained at the hands of a minority of the city councilors and a subordinate police officer was not of sufficient degree to constitute 'a constitutionally significant burden on [Wagner's] political association right.' \"   Memorandum and Order at 5 (quoting Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d 1209, 1216 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc )).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also concluded that, even if the harassment had been sufficiently severe to implicate constitutional concerns, Wagner's First Amendment claim still would fail because the police chief's position was one for which political affiliation is an appropriate requirement.  Public employees who hold such positions, the court ruled, are not protected by the First Amendment from partisan attacks on their job performance.  Having dismissed the federal claims, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law causes of action and dismissed them as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Wagners then filed this appeal.  Our review of the district court's Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal is de novo.  Romero-Barcelo v. Hernandez-Agosto, 75 F.3d 23, 28 n. 2 (1st Cir.1996).  We may affirm a dismissal for failure to state a claim only if it clearly appears that, on the facts alleged, the plaintiff cannot recover on any viable theory.  Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 52 (1st Cir.1990).  Because the district court's ruling that the First Amendment does not protect Wagner from politically motivated discrimination is both correct and dispositive, we turn to that issue first.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court more than twenty years ago established that the First Amendment provides protection for public employees from adverse job action based solely on partisan political affiliation.  See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976) (plurality opinion); Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980);  Rutan v. Republican Party, 497 U.S. 62, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The protection is not universal, however.  In its precedent-setting case examining the constitutionality of the patronage system, the Court recognized the competing First Amendment interest of the in-power political party \"to insure that policies which the electorate has sanctioned are effectively implemented,\" Elrod, 427 U.S. at 372, 96 S.Ct. at 2689.   The Court therefore allowed patronage practices to continue for those employees who, inter alia, make policy or occupy positions of confidence.  Id.; Branti, 445 U.S. at 517-18, 100 S.Ct. at 1294-95.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our circuit has since faced a long line of cases raising the issue of political discrimination in employment, most of which have focused on whether the particular position held by the plaintiff employee fell inside or outside the First Amendment-protected sphere.  See, e.g., Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1212 &amp; n. 1, 1218 (noting \"first wave\" of cases involving outright dismissals, and adopting standard for evaluating \"second wave\" cases involving discriminatory conduct falling short of discharge).  This case presents an interesting departure from the norm.  Both parties accept that Wagner's job as police chief sufficiently elevated him in the Holyoke hierarchy that, under the principles we have just outlined, he could be fired based on political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner, however, contends that he was subjected to an impermissible constructive discharge because only the mayor--the official who hired him and for whom he served as a policymaker--may fire him based on political affiliation without violating the First Amendment.  This is so, he maintains, because the Elrod-Branti exception was designed to ensure that the policies of a new administration--\"policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate,\" Elrod, 427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 2686--would not be undercut by the obstructive tactics of opposition incumbents.  This rationale provides no justification for opponents of a new administration--such as the defendants here--to harass the administration's supporters.  Their conduct, Wagner argues, is therefore unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner's analysis ignores the reality of precedent.  Both Supreme Court and First Circuit caselaw have recognized the applicability of the Elrod- Branti dichotomy outside the context of a new administration's patronage practices.  The conflict in Rutan, where the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment forbids government officials from basing less-than-discharge actions such as hiring, promotion, and transfer on political affiliation and support, did not arise amidst the seating of a new administration.  At issue was the implementation of an executive order proclaiming a hiring freeze, with \"exceptions\" allegedly made based on political affiliation.  In referring back to Elrod and Branti in the opinion's opening paragraph, the majority broadly described those cases as protecting public employees from discharge \"solely for not being supporters of the political party in power, unless party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position involved,\" 497 U.S. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2731.   That decision indicates that the First Amendment protection against patronage practices, as well as the exceptions for certain categories of highly placed employees, apply whenever public employees are at odds politically with their superiors and thus subject to politically discriminatory behaviors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Romero-Barcelo, 75 F.3d at 33-34, brings us even closer to the present context.  In rejecting a former Puerto Rico governor's allegations that he had suffered severe political discrimination during a murder investigation because of his association with the out-of-power New Progressive Party (NPP), we stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment \"protects nonpolicymakers from being drummed out of public service on the basis of their political affiliation or advocacy of ideas.\"  ...  But Romero-Barcelo most assuredly qualified as an NPP policymaker....  Thus, the district court correctly found no First Amendment protection for \"a politician whose rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, and freedom 'to disassociate [oneself] from unpopular views' have been injured by other politicians seeking to undermine his credibility within his own party and with the electorate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">75 F.3d at 34 (citations omitted).  Cf. LaRou v. Ridlon, 98 F.3d 659, 661 (1st Cir.1996) (noting as a general principle that \"[t]he First Amendment protects nonpolicymaking public employees from discrimination based on their political beliefs or affiliation\");  Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 56-57 &amp; n. 6 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion in Romero-Barcelo stemmed from a recognition that an administration's need to assure that it can implement the people's will is matched by the equally legitimate right of political opponents to exert pressure on behalf of their viewpoints and constituents.  Indeed, like the mayor, the minority members of the Holyoke City Council represented a portion of the electorate, and they therefore share the rationale that they were pursuing objectives sanctioned by the voters who supported them.  The democratic process envisions a give-and-take in matters of policy, and the unfortunate fact that some individuals will be caught in the crossfire is \"an all too real by-product of our long-standing organization of political life into two or more parties,\" Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1217.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Elrod-Branti line of cases struck a balance between the competing First Amendment interests by excluding policymaking public employees from constitutional protection.  See, e.g., id. at 1215 (quoting Elrod to the effect that \"there are First Amendment interests on both sides\");  Pieczynski v. Duffy, 875 F.2d 1331, 1334 (7th Cir.1989) (noting \"the balance\").  Policymakers, as front-line representatives of the policies they were hired to implement, can be expected to face stinging partisan attacks against their efforts by outsiders seeking to persuade the electorate (and fellow legislators) to make them the insiders.  Wagner was in a particularly vulnerable position because of the division of power over his job between the mayor and city council, both of whom possessed municipal authority--albeit in different ways--to terminate his employment.  At least when the political pressure exerted by those in power is within their authority,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the First Amendment does not provide a shield for those whose positions are politically sensitive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add this comment about appellant's particular circumstances.  Were appellant's argument to be accepted--i.e., that harassment and criticism by political opponents rising to the level of a constructive discharge constituted a First Amendment violation--we quail at the prospect of judges and juries being inundated by claims of unhappy politicians that their opponents had transgressed the boundary between constitutional and unconstitutional fair play.

This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the other issues surrounding his First Amendment claims, including the adequacy of his allegations, the scope of legislative immunity, and whether the allegedly improper motives of a four-member minority of a fifteen-member city council provide a basis for municipal liability.  In these circumstances, dismissal of the state law claims also is appropriate.  See McIntosh v.

In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we typically consider the \"well-pleaded facts as they appear in the complaint,\" see Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 51 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis added).  Because we ultimately uphold the dismissal, and the additional facts are helpful in understanding the case, we draw the facts in this section from both the complaint and the hearing.  For purposes of the motion to dismiss, we take the allegations as true and grant all reasonable inferences in Wagner's favor.  Aulson v.

The complaint, the hearing on the motion to dismiss, and the district court's opinion all reveal that this case has been litigated solely on the theory that defendants harassed and constructively discharged him based on his political beliefs and affiliation.  Our analysis is therefore confined to that context</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Defendants contend that they cannot be found liable for a constructive discharge because only the mayor had the authority to fire Wagner.  Their argument cuts too narrowly.  Although the city council may not have had explicit authority to terminate the police chief, its authority to set salary, benefits and working conditions gave it the power to accomplish a constructive discharge.  See, e.g., Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 480 (1st Cir.1993) (constructive discharge occurs when \"working conditions [are] so intolerable[ ] that a reasonable person would feel compelled to forsake his job rather than to submit to looming indignities\");  Aviles-Martinez v. Monroig, 963 F.2d 2, 6 (1st Cir.1992) (similar).  Of course, a minority of the council does not have such power, and a finding of constructive discharge would require some showing that the challenged conduct actually was attributable to the alleged discrimination.

He filed this lawsuit alleging federal constitutional and state law claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The district court dismissed the First Amendment counts for failure to state a claim, and declined supplemental jurisdiction over the state law counts.  Because the First Amendment does not protect a policymaking official such as appellant from criticism and harassment, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Wagner was appointed Holyoke's chief of police in July 1991 by then newly elected Mayor Hamilton.  Wagner asserts that four members of the City Council who were Hamilton's political opponents engaged in a campaign of harassment against him for the purpose of embarrassing the mayor and forcing appellant to resign.  He contends that their criticisms of his job performance were unfair and inaccurate, and that their actions were motivated solely by their opposition to his political beliefs and his political support of the mayor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  He further asserts that the president of the police union, and through him the local and international unions, conspired with the council members to effectuate the plan to oust him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The complaint accuses the council members of harassing him by means of unspecified \"actions,\" and numerous false and defamatory statements.  At the hearing on the motion to dismiss, appellant's counsel identified the challenged actions as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p>They were constantly criticizing him.  They had subcommittees that they were chairing and they had him up to see the council constantly, criticizing him in everything he did....  They tried to eliminate his salary.  They reduced his salary. They reduced his benefits.  They refused to fund programs that he was pushing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the mayor has sole authority under the city charter to hire or fire the police chief, the council has power to set the salary and benefits for the position.  According to Wagner, the four defendant council members, a minority of the governing body, \"led the charge\" against him and secured the complicity of enough other councilors to accomplish their unlawful objectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner resigned in September 1994.  He asserts that he was forced to do so because the defendants' actions and statements hindered, undermined, and interfered with the performance of his duties, and thus constituted a constructive discharge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lawsuit followed.  In addition to federal civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, which assert violation of his First Amendment right to political association, Wagner alleged a state civil rights violation, and state law claims of defamation, tortious interference with contractual relations, and, in his wife's name, loss of consortium.  In response to the defendants' motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), the district court substantively addressed only the section 1983 count.  It ruled that \"the alleged harassment which Wagner sustained at the hands of a minority of the city councilors and a subordinate police officer was not of sufficient degree to constitute 'a constitutionally significant burden on [Wagner's] political association right.' \"   Memorandum and Order at 5 (quoting Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532523\"><a href=\"/opinion/532523/maria-m-agosto-de-feliciano-v-awilda-aponte-roque-etc-maria-teresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span>, 1216 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc )).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court also concluded that, even if the harassment had been sufficiently severe to implicate constitutional concerns, Wagner's First Amendment claim still would fail because the police chief's position was one for which political affiliation is an appropriate requirement.  Public employees who hold such positions, the court ruled, are not protected by the First Amendment from partisan attacks on their job performance.  Having dismissed the federal claims, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law causes of action and dismissed them as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Wagners then filed this appeal.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span> (1990).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The protection is not universal, however.  In its precedent-setting case examining the constitutionality of the patronage system, the Court recognized the competing First Amendment interest of the in-power political party \"to insure that policies which the electorate has sanctioned are effectively implemented,\" Elrod, 427 U.S. at 372, 96 S.Ct. at 2689.   The Court therefore allowed patronage practices to continue for those employees who, inter alia, make policy or occupy positions of confidence.  Id.; Branti, 445 U.S. at 517-18, 100 S.Ct. at 1294-95.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our circuit has since faced a long line of cases raising the issue of political discrimination in employment, most of which have focused on whether the particular position held by the plaintiff employee fell inside or outside the First Amendment-protected sphere.  See, e.g., Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1212 &amp; n. 1, 1218 (noting \"first wave\" of cases involving outright dismissals, and adopting standard for evaluating \"second wave\" cases involving discriminatory conduct falling short of discharge).  This case presents an interesting departure from the norm.  Both parties accept that Wagner's job as police chief sufficiently elevated him in the Holyoke hierarchy that, under the principles we have just outlined, he could be fired based on political affiliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner, however, contends that he was subjected to an impermissible constructive discharge because only the mayor--the official who hired him and for whom he served as a policymaker--may fire him based on political affiliation without violating the First Amendment.  This is so, he maintains, because the Elrod-Branti exception was designed to ensure that the policies of a new administration--\"policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate,\" Elrod, 427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. at 2686--would not be undercut by the obstructive tactics of opposition incumbents.  This rationale provides no justification for opponents of a new administration--such as the defendants here--to harass the administration's supporters.  Their conduct, Wagner argues, is therefore unconstitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wagner's analysis ignores the reality of precedent.  Both Supreme Court and First Circuit caselaw have recognized the applicability of the Elrod- Branti dichotomy outside the context of a new administration's patronage practices.  The conflict in Rutan, where the Supreme Court held that the First Amendment forbids government officials from basing less-than-discharge actions such as hiring, promotion, and transfer on political affiliation and support, did not arise amidst the seating of a new administration.  At issue was the implementation of an executive order proclaiming a hiring freeze, with \"exceptions\" allegedly made based on political affiliation.  In referring back to Elrod and Branti in the opinion's opening paragraph, the majority broadly described those cases as protecting public employees from discharge \"solely for not being supporters of the political party in power, unless party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position involved,\" 497 U.S. at 64, 110 S.Ct. at 2731.   That decision indicates that the First Amendment protection against patronage practices, as well as the exceptions for certain categories of highly placed employees, apply whenever public employees are at odds politically with their superiors and thus subject to politically discriminatory behaviors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our decision in Romero-Barcelo, 75 F.3d at 33-34, brings us even closer to the present context.  In rejecting a former Puerto Rico governor's allegations that he had suffered severe political discrimination during a murder investigation because of his association with the out-of-power New Progressive Party (NPP), we stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>The Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment \"protects nonpolicymakers from being drummed out of public service on the basis of their political affiliation or advocacy of ideas.\"  ...  But Romero-Barcelo most assuredly qualified as an NPP policymaker....  Thus, the district court correctly found no First Amendment protection for \"a politician whose rights to freedom of speech, freedom of association, and freedom 'to disassociate [oneself] from unpopular views' have been injured by other politicians seeking to undermine his credibility within his own party and with the electorate.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">75 F.3d at 34 (citations omitted).

Indeed, like the mayor, the minority members of the Holyoke City Council represented a portion of the electorate, and they therefore share the rationale that they were pursuing objectives sanctioned by the voters who supported them.  The democratic process envisions a give-and-take in matters of policy, and the unfortunate fact that some individuals will be caught in the crossfire is \"an all too real by-product of our long-standing organization of political life into two or more parties,\" Agosto-de-Feliciano, 889 F.2d at 1217.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Elrod-Branti line of cases struck a balance between the competing First Amendment interests by excluding policymaking public employees from constitutional protection.  See, e.g., id. at 1215 (quoting Elrod to the effect that \"there are First Amendment interests on both sides\");  Pieczynski v. Duffy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524091\"><a href=\"/opinion/524091/mary-pieczynski-v-katherine-duffy-and-roberto-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1334 (7th Cir.1989) (noting \"the balance\").  Policymakers, as front-line representatives of the policies they were hired to implement, can be expected to face stinging partisan attacks against their efforts by outsiders seeking to persuade the electorate (and fellow legislators) to make them the insiders.  Wagner was in a particularly vulnerable position because of the division of power over his job between the mayor and city council, both of whom possessed municipal authority--albeit in different ways--to terminate his employment.  At least when the political pressure exerted by those in power is within their authority,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the First Amendment does not provide a shield for those whose positions are politically sensitive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add this comment about appellant's particular circumstances.  Were appellant's argument to be accepted--i.e., that harassment and criticism by political opponents rising to the level of a constructive discharge constituted a First Amendment violation--we quail at the prospect of judges and juries being inundated by claims of unhappy politicians that their opponents had transgressed the boundary between constitutional and unconstitutional fair play.

This conclusion makes it unnecessary to consider the other issues surrounding his First Amendment claims, including the adequacy of his allegations, the scope of legislative immunity, and whether the allegedly improper motives of a four-member minority of a fifteen-member city council provide a basis for municipal liability.  In these circumstances, dismissal of the state law claims also is appropriate.  See McIntosh v.

In reviewing a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we typically consider the \"well-pleaded facts as they appear in the complaint,\" see Correa-Martinez v. Arrillaga-Belendez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1990) (emphasis added).  Because we ultimately uphold the dismissal, and the additional facts are helpful in understanding the case, we draw the facts in this section from both the complaint and the hearing.  For purposes of the motion to dismiss, we take the allegations as true and grant all reasonable inferences in Wagner's favor.  Aulson v. Blanchard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717572\"><a href=\"/opinion/717572/alan-aulson-et-ux-maureen-aulson-v-charles-blanchard/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1996)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In his appellate briefs, Wagner makes several passing references to a First Amendment violation based on his political speech, as well as on political affiliation, and he cites several speech cases in support of his arguments.  The complaint, the hearing on the motion to dismiss, and the district court's opinion all reveal that this case has been litigated solely on the theory that defendants harassed and constructively discharged him based on his political beliefs and affiliation.  Our analysis is therefore confined to that context</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Defendants contend that they cannot be found liable for a constructive discharge because only the mayor had the authority to fire Wagner.  Their argument cuts too narrowly.  Although the city council may not have had explicit authority to terminate the police chief, its authority to set salary, benefits and working conditions gave it the power to accomplish a constructive discharge.  See, e.g., Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628958\"><a href=\"/opinion/628958/62-fair-emplpraccas-1198-62-empl-prac-dec-p-42530-17-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 480 (1st Cir.1993) (constructive discharge occurs when \"working conditions [are] so intolerable[ ] that a reasonable person would feel compelled to forsake his job rather than to submit to looming indignities\");  Aviles-Martinez v. Monroig, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582754\"><a href=\"/opinion/582754/francisco-aviles-martinez-and-miguel-a-flores-colon-v-guillermo-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1992) (similar).  Of course, a minority of the council does not have such power, and a finding of constructive discharge would require some showing that the challenged conduct actually was attributable to the alleged discrimination.

City of Fall River, Nos. 95-1950-1952, 95-2100, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1997</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9102</span></span>, at * 9-10 (1st Cir.
