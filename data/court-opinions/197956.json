RIVERA HERNANDEZ,\r\n\n                        Defendant.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n             FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n      [Hon. Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Ricardo R. Pesquera on brief for appellant.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Rosa E. Rodriguez-\r\nVelez, Executive Assistant United States Attorney, Nelson Perez-\r\nSosa, Assistant United States Attorney, and Jose A. Quiles-\r\nEspinosa, Senior Litigation Counsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMay 14, 1998\r\n\n                                        Per Curiam. After conducting an independent review of\r\nthe district court record, and giving due deference to the\r\ndistrict court's findings of fact, see United States v.\r\nTortora, 922 F.2d 880, 882 (1st Cir. 1990), we decline to\r\ndisturb the order of pretrial detection.  This order concluded\r\nthat the government had demonstrated, by clear and convincing\r\nevidence, that \"no condition or combination of conditions will\r\nreasonably assure . . . the safety of any other person and the\r\ncommunity\" if defendant is released.  See 18 U.S.C.  3142(e).\r\n    First, we accept the district court's conclusion that\r\nthe evidence shows that defendant is part of a tightly-knit\r\ndrug organization prone to violence.  We also note that\r\ndefendant does not appear to play just a minor role in this\r\norganization since, according to the government's proffer, he\r\nhas been tape-recorded discussing drug deals with the head of\r\nthe organization, Miguel Gonzalez-Sanchez.  In this context, we\r\nquestion defendant's contention that the discovery provided to\r\nhim so far shows only that he is a \"small-scale buyer\"; that\r\nis, the amount he supposedly bought -- about one kilogram of\r\ndrugs -- arguably was not for personal use, but for resale.\r\n    As for the conditions of release posed by defendant,\r\nwe agree that they are not adequate to assure the community's\r\nsafety.  Specifically, the posting of the properties of\r\ndefendant's relatives as security for bail absent an agreement\r\nthat the properties be forfeited upon the breach by defendant\r\nof any of the conditions of release goes more to assuring the\r\npresence of defendant than to assuring the community's safety. \r\nSee United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d 789, 793-94 (1st Cir.\r\n1991).  Similarly, electronic monitoring, while allowing\r\ndetection of flight, \"cannot be expected to prevent a defendant\r\nfrom committing crimes or deter him from participating in\r\nfelonious activity within monitoring radius.\"  Tortora, 922\r\nF.2d at 887.  In the same vein, by permitting defendant to\r\nwork, \"a sizeable loophole\" may be created -- the opportunity\r\nto use outside communication facilities to continue drug\r\ndealaing.  See id.  Finally, given the prevalence of cellular\r\ntelephones, agreeing to have no telephone line in the home also\r\nis scant protection against continued criminal activity.  Seeid.\r\n    In relation to defendant's medical condition, we note\r\nthat the district court entered an order on March 17, 1998\r\ndirecting the prison warden to have defendant evaluated by a\r\nneurologist \"ASAP.\"  We assume that this order has been obeyed\r\nand that defendant's medical condition is under control. \r\nShould further problems arise, defendant can notify the\r\ndistrict court and request it to take appropriate action.\r\n    Based on the foregoing, we affirm the order of\r\npretrial detention.\n",
