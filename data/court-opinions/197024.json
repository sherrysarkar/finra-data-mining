Townsend,  General Counsel,  Joan T.  Kennedy,  Assistant\r                                                                  \r\nGeneral Counsel, Merita A. Hopkins,  Corporation Counsel, and Kevin S.\r                                                                              \r\nMcDermott, Assistant Corporation Counsel, on brief for appellees.\r                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                       October 15, 1996\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.   Upon  careful review  of  the briefs  and\r                            \r\n\nrecord,  it  clearly appears  that  this  appeal presents  no\r\n\nsubstantial question,  and we  perceive no reason  to reverse\r\n\nthe judgment from which plaintiff appeals.  \r\n\n     Specifically,  we  agree  with the  district  court that\r\n\nplaintiff's  allegations of  negligence were  insufficient to\r\n\nstate a federal  claim.   See Daniels v.  Williams, 474  U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n327, 331-33  (1986) (no constitutional due  process claim was\r\n\nstated against  prison  officials for  \"negligent failure  to\r\n\nprotect\");  Manarite v.  City of  Springfield, 957  F.2d 953,\r                                                         \r\n\n957-59 (1st Cir.)  (dismissing   1983 claims where police did\r\n\nnot act  with \"deliberate  indifference\"), cert. denied,  506\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S.  837   (1992).    Even  plaintiff's   sketchy  claim  of\r\n\nharassment  by  the prison  staff  was grounded  in  the same\r\n\ninsufficient allegations of negligence underlying the rest of\r\n\nhis complaint.   On that  basis, the district  court properly\r\n\ndetermined that  defendants were entitled to  judgment on any\r\n\nfederal claims. \r\n\n     The  district  court  also properly  determined  that it\r\n\nwould not  exercise pendent  jurisdiction over  any remaining\r\n\nstate claims, once the federal claims were dismissed.  See 28\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.   1367(c)(3) (district court  may decline supplemental\r\n\njurisdiction if it has dismissed all claims over which it has\r\n\noriginal jurisdiction); Carnegie-Mellon University v. Cohill,\r                                                                        \r\n\n484 U.S.  343, 350 (1988)  (district court has  discretion to\r\r\n\nretain   or   dismiss  the   remaining  state   claims,  upon\r\n\nconsideration  of factors such  as comity,  judicial economy,\r\n\nconvenience, and  fairness); Roche v. John  Hancock Mut. Life\r                                                                         \r\n\nIns. Co., 81 F.3d 249, 257 (1st Cir. 1996) (same).   No abuse\r                    \r\n\nof that discretion is apparent  here.  Although plaintiff may\r\n\nhave preferred a remand  to the state court, in light  of the\r\n\ntolling provision of 28  U.S.C.   1367(d), he was  not harmed\r\n\nby  the dismissal.  See Edmondson &amp; Gallagher v. Alban Towers\r                                                                         \r\n\nTenants Ass'n, 48 F.3d 1260, 1267 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (  1367(d)\r                         \r\n\ntolls the state  statute of  limitations on  any state  claim\r\n\nover   which  a  federal  court  has  exercised  supplemental\r\n\njurisdiction  until  30 days  after  its  dismissal and  thus\r\n\nreduces the  concern that plaintiffs would  lose their claims\r\n\nif their case were dismissed).\r\n\n     We note that, while this appeal was pending (and without\r\n\nfollowing  the procedure set forth  in Puerto Rico  v. SS Zoe\r                                                                         \r\n\nColocotroni,  601 F.2d  39,  42 (1st  Cir. 1979)),  plaintiff\r                       \r\n\nasked the  district court to vacate the judgment of dismissal\r\n\nand remand the case to the state court.  Plaintiff apparently\r\n\nbelieved that the  statute of limitations had expired  on his\r\n\ndismissed  state law claims and that he could not refile them\r\n\nin state court.  By orders  dated July 16, 1996, the district\r\n\ncourt granted  plaintiff's  motions and  remanded  the  case.\r\n\nDefendants have moved for reconsideration or clarification of\r\n\nthose orders, but  the district  court has not  yet acted  on\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nthat  motion.    In  other  words,  the  district  court  has\r\n\npurported to vacate the  very judgment that is now  before us\r\n\non appeal.\r\n\n     For the purpose of this appeal, we consider the July 16,\r\n\n1996, orders to be  nullities.  See Toscano v.  Chandris, 934\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 383, 387  (1st Cir.  1991) (giving no  effect to  orders\r\n\nentered  without compliance  with the  Colocotroni procedure;\r                                                              \r\n\n\"[i]f  courts did  not  demand that  litigants recognize  and\r\n\nrespect jurisdictional borders, the judicial system  would be\r\n\nadrift  in  a  sea   of  competing  decrees  and  duplicative\r\n\nproceedings\").     Once  our  mandate  issues,  however,  the\r\n\ndistrict court may act  on plaintiff's post-judgment  motions\r\n\nand defendants'  motion for reconsideration.    Should either\r\n\nparty desire  to appeal from  any such subsequent  rulings, a\r\n\nseparate notice of appeal must be filed.\r\n\n     The  judgment appealed from  is affirmed, and appellees'\r                                                         \r\n\nmotion to  be heard at oral argument is denied.
