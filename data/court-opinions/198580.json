Davis, with whom Frances L. Robinson, and Davis,\r\nRobinson &amp; White, LLP were on brief, for appellant.\r\n  S. Theodore Merritt, Assistant United States Attorney, with\r\nwhom Bill Lann Lee, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Donald K.\r\nStern, United States Attorney, and Sheryl L. Robinson, Trial\r\nAttorney, Criminal Section, were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                        July 23, 1999\r\n                                           TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  The underlying case in this\r\nappeal stems from an April 1997 federal grand jury investigation\r\ninto an incident in which Michael Cox, a plain clothes Boston\r\npolice officer, was allegedly mistaken for a fleeing suspect and\r\nbeaten by unknown police officers in violation of 18 U.S.C.  242. \r\nOn May 29, 1997, defendant-appellant Kenneth Conley, a Boston\r\npolice officer at the scene of the incident, testified before the\r\ngrand jury pursuant to an immunity order.  Conley was subsequently\r\nconvicted of perjury and obstruction of justice as a result of his\r\ngrand jury testimony and was sentenced to thirty-four months\r\nimprisonment and a $6,000 fine.  Conley now appeals his conviction.\r\n                          BACKGROUND\r\nAt approximately 2:30 a.m. on January 25, 1995, a\r\nshooting occurred at a restaurant on Blue Hill Avenue in the Grove\r\nHall section of Boston.  It was mistakenly broadcast over the\r\npolice radio that the victim of the shooting was a Boston police\r\nofficer.  The suspects were described as four black males driving\r\na gold Lexus.  The mistaken broadcast of a police officer down\r\ngenerated a massive response by police cruisers from several\r\ndifferent districts.  A chase ensued.\r\nThe suspects led the police on a lengthy car chase\r\nspanning three police districts and several towns.  The closest\r\npolice vehicle behind the Lexus throughout most of the chase was an\r\nunmarked police cruiser occupied by plain clothes officers Craig\r\nJones and Michael Cox.  Jones was the driver of the vehicle, and \r\nCox occupied the passenger seat.\r\nThe car chase finally ended when the suspects drove down\r\na dead end street known as Woodruff Way in Mattapan.  When the\r\nsuspects arrived at the cul-de-sac at the end of Woodruff Way, the\r\nJones/Cox unmarked cruiser was the first police car on the scene,\r\nand skidded to a stop on the left side of the Lexus.  The second\r\npolice cruiser to arrive was occupied by uniformed officers David\r\nWilliams and James Burgio.  Williams and Burgio pulled in on the\r\nright side of the Lexus.  Uniformed officer Ian Daley arrived next,\r\nand pulled in directly behind the Lexus.  Immediately behind Daley\r\nwas uniformed officer Richard Walker, followed by defendant-\r\nappellant Conley and his partner, Robert Dwan.  The Conley/Dwan\r\nvehicle was thus the fifth police vehicle on the scene.  Conley and\r\nDwan wore plain clothes and occupied an unmarked police vehicle.\r\nAs the gold Lexus came to a stop at the end of Woodruff\r\nWay, Cox observed one of the suspects, later identified as Robert\r\nBrown, exit the gold Lexus from the passenger side, and run to the\r\nright, towards a fence.  In pursuit, Cox exited his vehicle from\r\nthe passenger side, ran behind the Lexus, and followed the suspect\r\nto the right, towards the fence.  Cox described the suspect as a\r\nblack male wearing a brown leather jacket.  Cox, also black, was\r\nwearing jeans, a black hooded sweatshirt, and a three-quarter\r\nlength black down jacket.\r\nCox chased the suspect to the fence, approximately twenty\r\nfeet away.  During the chase, Cox was \"about three feet\" behind the\r\nsuspect.  (Tr. Vol. II at 31).  When the suspect got to the fence,\r\nthe suspect began climbing over it, catching his jacket for a\r\nmoment on the top.  At that moment, Cox reached up and attempted to\r\ngrab the suspect and pull him back over the fence.  Cox testified\r\nthat approximately two seconds elapsed between the time that the\r\nsuspect caught his jacket on the top of the fence and the time when\r\nCox grabbed the suspect's jacket in an attempt to pull him back\r\nover the fence.  (See Tr. Vol. II at 14, 76).  Cox's attempt\r\nfailed, however, and the suspect dropped down on the other side of\r\nthe fence and started to run.  Cox did not observe anyone else\r\nclimb over the fence between him and the suspect.\r\nAfter the suspect landed on the other side, Cox took a\r\nstep back from the fence, considering for a moment whether to\r\nfollow over the fence.  A moment later, Cox placed both his hands\r\nup on the fence, as if to go over.  At that point, Cox felt a sharp\r\nblow on the back of his head, like a metal pipe.  The next thing he\r\nknew he was on the ground on his hands and knees, trying to get up. \r\nHe observed a white male standing in front of him, wearing boots\r\nand a dark uniform.  Cox was repeatedly kicked in the head, back,\r\nface, and mouth by several different people all at once.  The\r\nbeating did not stop until Cox heard someone yell: \"Stop, stop,\r\nhe's a cop, he's a cop.\"  (Tr. Vol. I at 88).  When the kicking\r\nfinally stopped, Cox attempted to get up from the ground.  When he\r\nlooked up, he realized that there was no one around to assist him. \r\nCox was forced to use the bumper of a police car to pull himself up\r\nfrom the ground.\r\nIn April 1997, a federal grand jury commenced an\r\ninvestigation into the beating of Officer Michael Cox.  The grand\r\njury sought to determine the identity of the officers who attacked\r\nMichael Cox and/or deliberately failed to prevent the assault and \r\nto get medical attention for him once they knew he was injured.  On\r\nMay 29, 1997, defendant-appellant Conley, an officer present at the\r\nscene, was called before the grand jury to recount the events he\r\nobserved and the actions he took at Woodruff Way in the early\r\nmorning hours of January 25, 1995.\r\nConsistent with Cox's version of events, Conley testified \r\nthat when he arrived at the dead end on Woodruff Way, his vehicle\r\nwas about the fourth or fifth police car in line behind the\r\nsuspects' gold Lexus, approximately forty feet away.  (See Tr. Vol.\r\nII at 229-30, 232).  Also consistent with Cox's account, Conley\r\ntestified that once the Lexus skidded to a stop, a black male\r\nwearing a brown leather jacket exited from the passenger side of\r\nthe Lexus and ran to the right, towards a fence.  Conley exited his\r\nvehicle in pursuit.  While in pursuit, Conley observed the suspect\r\nscale the fence, drop down on the other side, and start to run. \r\n(See id. at 233).\r\nConley testified that he made all of these observations\r\nas he pursued the suspect, beginning from the time the suspect\r\nfirst exited the gold Lexus up to the time when the suspect landed\r\non the other side of the fence and started to run.  According to\r\nCox's testimony, Conley made these observations at precisely the\r\nsame time that Cox was chasing \"right behind\" the suspect.  (Tr.\r\nVol. I at 77).  However, before the grand jury, Conley testified\r\nthat during that time he did not observe anyone -- either in plain\r\nclothes or in uniform -- between him and the suspect.  In direct\r\nconflict with Cox's account, Conley testified as follows:\r\n         Q:     All right.  Now, officer Conley, when\r\n       you were chasing the suspect as he went\r\n       over to the fence, did you see another\r\n       individual chasing him as well?\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     Did you see anyone else in plain\r\n       clothes behind him as he went towards\r\n       the fence?\r\n         A:     No, I didn't.\r\n         Q:     Did you see, as he went on top of the\r\n       fence or climbed the fence, another\r\n       individual in plain clothes standing\r\n       there, trying to grab him? \r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     When you saw the suspect get to the top\r\n       of the fence, did you see another\r\n       individual in plain clothes grabbing\r\n       part of his clothing --\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     -- as he went over the fence?\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     So that didn't happen; is that correct? \r\n       Because you saw the individual go over\r\n       the fence?\r\n         A:     Yes, I seen [sic] the individual go\r\n       over the fence.\r\n         Q:     And if these other things that I've\r\n       been describing, a second -- another\r\n       plain clothes officer chasing him, and\r\n       actually grabbing him as he went to the\r\n       top of the fence, you would have seen\r\n       that if it happened; is that your\r\n       testimony?\r\n         A:     I think I would have seen that. \r\n(Tr. Vol. II at 235-36).  Conley further testified that when he got\r\nto the fence, he climbed over it in \"approximately the same\r\nlocation\" that he had observed the suspect go over the fence, and\r\ncontinued in pursuit.  (Id. at 239).  Eventually, after chasing the\r\nsuspect for approximately one mile, Conley apprehended him and\r\neffected an arrest.\r\nTwo other individuals, present at the scene, testified at\r\nConley's trial: Officer Walker, and the suspect, Robert Brown. \r\nOfficer Walker corroborated Cox's version of events up to the point\r\nwhen the suspect climbed over the fence and dropped down on the\r\nother side:\r\n         Q:     Did you see - did Officer Cox reach for\r\n       the person on the fence?\r\n         A:     Yes, he did.\r\n         Q:     What did the person who went over the\r\n       fence do once they went over the fence?\r\n         A:     Once he went over the fence, he fell.\r\n                              . . . \r\n         Q:     What did Officer Cox do once the person\r\n       went over the fence?\r\n         A:     I don't know.\r\n\n(Tr. Vol. II at 32).  After observing the suspect fall on the other\r\nside of the fence, Walker ran from his car straight ahead to a hole\r\nin the fence.  Walker did not see Cox put his hands on the fence,\r\nas if to go over.  The last thing Walker saw Cox do was reach for\r\nthe suspect caught on the fence.  (See id. at 33).\r\nOnce through the hole in the fence, Walker ran to the\r\nright, in pursuit of the fleeing suspect.  As he ran, he came upon\r\ntwo white, plain clothes police officers standing in the street. \r\nWalker testified that no one had passed by him from the time that\r\nhe ran through the hole in the fence to the time when he\r\nencountered the two white police officers.  He did not know where\r\nthe two officers had come from; he had not observed them jump over\r\nthe fence.  The taller of the two officers asked Walker whether he\r\nhad a light, and when Walker responded that he did not, the taller\r\nofficer took off running.  Walker followed, approximately two yards\r\nbehind.  (See Tr. Vol. II at 67).\r\nDuring the chase, the tall white officer in front of\r\nWalker dropped his radio.  Walker stopped to pick up the radio, and\r\nthen continued in pursuit.  When the tall white officer finally\r\napprehended the suspect, Walker returned his radio to him.  At\r\ntrial, Walker testified that the tall white officer was\r\napproximately the same height and size as defendant-appellant\r\nConley.\r\nRobert Brown, the suspect wearing the brown leather\r\njacket who was allegedly pursued by both Cox and Conley, also\r\ntestified at trial.  Brown corroborated much of Cox's account.  He\r\ntestified that when the Lexus skidded to a stop at the end of\r\nWoodruff Way, he exited the vehicle from the rear passenger side,\r\nand headed to the right, towards the fence.  He further testified\r\nthat as he ran towards the fence, he looked back and saw a black\r\nman wearing black clothing running behind him.  When he arrived at\r\nthe fence, Brown flipped over it, catching his jacket on the top. \r\nBrown stated that as he attempted to free his jacket from the top\r\nof the fence, he felt somebody touch his foot.  Once he became free\r\nof the fence, Brown fell backwards down a hill, ran into a tree,\r\nand split his tooth in half.  Dazed and confused, Brown remained on\r\nthe ground for a moment and observed a black man wearing a \"black\r\nhoody\" start to \"go for the fence.\"  (Tr. Vol. II at 97-8).  As the\r\nman grabbed for the fence, Brown observed a police officer hit the\r\nman twice on the back of the head with a billy club or a\r\nflashlight, something \"shaped like a pipe.\"  (Id. at 98).  Brown\r\ndescribed the police officer as a tall, black man with a mustache,\r\nwearing a Boston police uniform and a badge.\r\nBrown next observed a second officer come over to the\r\nfence to assist the tall black officer in wrestling the black man\r\nto the ground.  Once the man was down on the ground, Brown\r\ntestified that approximately three or four other police officers --\r\nuniformed and plain clothes -- came over to the fence and began to\r\nkick the man.  At this point, Brown stood up to run.  As he stood\r\nup, Brown made eye contact with a tall white officer on the other\r\nside of the fence.  Brown testified that he did not observe this\r\nwhite officer kick the man on the ground.\r\nOnce the tall white officer made eye contact with Brown,\r\nBrown began to run, and the white officer followed.  Eventually,\r\nthe white officer caught Brown and arrested him.  At trial, Brown\r\ntestified that the arresting officer was the same tall white\r\nofficer he had made eye contact with through the fence.\r\nOn August 14, 1997, Conley was charged in a three-count\r\nindictment arising from his grand jury testimony.  Count One\r\ncharged that Conley committed perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n1623, by denying that he saw Cox chase, pursue, and grab hold of\r\na suspect as that suspect ran toward and climbed the fence at\r\nWoodruff Way.  Count Two charged that Conley also committed perjury\r\nby denying that he saw Boston police officers strike and kick Cox. \r\nCount Three charged that Conley obstructed and endeavored to\r\nobstruct the grand jury investigation by giving false, evasive, and\r\nmisleading testimony and withholding information, in violation of\r\n18 U.S.C.  1503.  On June 10, the jury returned verdicts of guilty\r\non Counts One and Three and not guilty on Count Two.  \r\n                          DISCUSSION\r\nOn appeal, Conley raises several challenges to his\r\nconviction.  We address each of his challenges in turn.\r\n1.  The Testimony of the Grand Juror\r\nTitle 18 U.S.C.  1623 states, in relevant part:\r\n  Whoever under oath . . . in any proceeding\r\nbefore or ancillary to any court or grand jury\r\nof the United States knowingly makes any false\r\nmaterial declaration . . . shall be fined not\r\nmore than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than\r\nfive years, or both.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  1623.  It is uncontested that a conviction under  1623\r\nrequires that the statements made be \"material\" to the proceeding,\r\nhere a grand jury investigation.  See id.  It is also uncontested\r\nthat \"materiality\" is an element that the government bears the\r\nburden of proving.  The question presented by defendant-appellant\r\nConley is whether the district court erred in allowing the\r\ngovernment to prove this element by calling Jeanne LaBelle, a\r\nmember of the grand jury that investigated the Cox incident, to\r\ntestify as to the scope and purpose of the grand jury's\r\ninvestigation.  Conley contends that the district court erred in\r\nadmitting Ms. LaBelle's testimony, and that such error warrants\r\nreversal of his conviction.  We disagree.\r\nA.  Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)\r\nBefore this court, Conley argues for the first time that\r\nthe admission of Ms. LaBelle's testimony violated Fed. R. Evid.\r\n606(b).  Although Conley objected to the admission of\r\nMs. LaBelle's testimony on other grounds, Conley never raised the\r\napplicability of Rule 606(b) before the district court.  \"Our law\r\nis clear that a party ordinarily may not raise on appeal issues\r\nthat were not seasonably advanced (and, hence preserved) below.\" \r\nCooperman v. Individual, Inc., 171 F.3d 43, 50 (1st Cir. 1999)\r\n(quoting Daigle v. Maine Medical Center, Inc., 14 F.3d 684, 687\r\n(1st Cir. 1994)).  We see no reason to depart from this well-\r\nestablished rule in this case.  We thus decline to address Conley's\r\nRule 606(b) argument, except to say that plain error is plainly\r\nabsent.\r\nB.  Fed. R. Evid. 403\r\nConley next claims that the district court erred in\r\nadmitting Ms. LaBelle's testimony because its probative value was\r\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  See\r\nFed. R. Evid. 403.  Specifically, Conley argues that the admission\r\nof the testimony of a grand juror who voted to return an indictment\r\nagainst him was unfairly prejudicial in that it called upon the\r\npetit jury to evaluate the credibility of a grand juror.  Conley\r\ncontends that because of the \"natural tendency\" of the petit jury\r\nto identify with the grand juror, the petit jury inevitably gave\r\nundue weight and credence to Ms. LaBelle's testimony.  Conley\r\nfurther argues that the admission of Ms. LaBelle's testimony\r\nunfairly prejudiced his case because it caused the jury to confuse\r\nthe standards of proof governing the grand jury decision to indict\r\nand the petit jury decision to convict, respectively.  Finally,\r\nConley claims that the government's use of the testimony of a\r\nmember of the grand jury that returned an indictment against him,\r\nviolated his presumption of innocence in that it called upon the\r\njury to infer guilt from the fact of his indictment.  For all of\r\nthese reasons, Conley maintains that the admission of Ms. LaBelle's\r\ntestimony should have been excluded under Fed. R. Evid. 403.\r\nWe review the district court's Rule 403 determination for\r\nabuse of discretion.  See United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, 75 F.3d 59,\r\n61 (1st Cir. 1996).  We note that \"[o]nly rarely -- and in\r\nextraordinarily compelling circumstances -- will we, from the vista\r\nof a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot\r\njudgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and\r\nunfair effect.\"  United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 773 (1st\r\nCir. 1995) (quoting Freeman v. Package Mach. Corp., 865 F.2d 1331,\r\n1340 (1st Cir. 1988)).\r\nAlthough the district court did not make express \r\nfindings with respect to its Rule 403 balancing, it is apparent\r\nfrom the record that the court was aware of its responsibility to\r\nbalance the probative value of Ms. LaBelle's testimony against its\r\nunfairly prejudicial effect.  See United States v. Santagata, 924\r\nF.2d 391, 394 (1st Cir. 1991) (where pleadings and record evidence\r\nshow that court was aware of its Rule 403 responsibility, express\r\nfindings not necessary).  As the district court noted, the\r\ntestimony of Ms. LaBelle was clearly relevant to materiality. \r\nMs. LaBelle testified as to the scope and purpose of the grand jury\r\ninquiry:\r\n  We were investigating an assault that took\r\nplace on Officer Michael Cox on January 25th\r\nof 1995, and we were trying to establish the\r\nidentity of officers who participated in the\r\nattack.  We were trying to determine if there\r\nwas excessive force used, and also we were\r\ntrying to determine who the officers were who\r\ndeliberately failed to get medical attention\r\nonce they knew that he had been injured.\r\n\n(Tr. Vol. III at 114).  Ms. LaBelle further testified that\r\ndefendant-appellant Conley was one of approximately forty-five\r\nofficers called to testify before the grand jury, and that after\r\nConley's testimony the grand jury did not have any more evidence\r\nconcerning the identity of the officers who beat Cox or the\r\nidentity of any witnesses to the beating.  Finally, Ms. LaBelle\r\ntestified that at the time she ended her service as a grand juror,\r\nthe grand jury had not returned any indictments for the assault of\r\nMichael Cox.  Ms. LaBelle's testimony was probative in the sense\r\nthat it provided a context for Conley's allegedly false statements\r\nfrom which the jury could infer materiality.\r\nWe next consider Conley's assertions of prejudicial\r\neffect.  Conley offers no evidence to support his theory that the\r\npetit jurors were improperly influenced by their sense of identity\r\nor \"camaraderie\" with Ms. LaBelle.  Absent such evidence, we cannot\r\nconclude that the mere possibility that some sort of bonding\r\noccurred between the petit jury and Ms. LaBelle substantially\r\noutweighs the probative value of Ms. LaBelle's testimony. \r\nMoreover, as the government points out, the petit jury's split\r\nverdict undermines Conley's theory of improper influence.  See\r\nUnited States v. Dworken, 855 F.2d 12, 29 (1st Cir. 1988) (jury's\r\nacquittal on one count indicates that it was not influenced by\r\npotentially prejudicial evidence).\r\nConley's other claims of unfair prejudice stem from the\r\ndistrict court's failure to explicitly instruct the jury with\r\nrespect to the different standards of proof governing the grand\r\njury's decision to indict and a petit jury's decision to convict. \r\nWe find no unfair prejudice.  Any risk of juror confusion\r\nconcerning the appropriate standard of proof was minimized by the\r\ndistrict judge's thorough instructions concerning the presumption\r\nof innocence and the government's burden to prove its case beyond\r\na reasonable doubt.  In addition, the district judge made it\r\nabundantly clear to the jurors on several different occasions that\r\nthe indictment returned by the grand jury \"is in no sense a part of\r\nthe evidence that you will consider as you consider whether the\r\ngovernment has met its heavy burden of proof of guilt beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.\"  (Tr. Vol. I at 32).  Finally, the district\r\njudge explicitly requested Conley to submit any additions to the\r\nproposed jury instructions \"in order to make it clear that in no\r\nway does receiving any testimony make the indictment a part of the\r\nevidence that the jury is to consider.\"  (Tr. Vol. III at 71). \r\nConley failed to submit any such suggestions and cannot now\r\ncomplain of unfair prejudice.\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the\r\ndistrict court acted well within its discretion in allowing the\r\ngovernment to call Ms. LaBelle to testify as to the scope of the\r\ngrand jury investigation for the purpose of proving the materiality\r\nof Conley's statements.\r\nC.  Fed. R. Crim P. 6(e)(2)\r\nConley next alleges that the district court erred by\r\npermitting Ms. LaBelle to testify because the government failed to\r\npetition the court in advance for a disclosure order as required by\r\nFed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(C)(i) &amp; (D).  We review Conley's claim de\r\nnovo to the extent that he raises a legal issue with respect to the\r\napplicability of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(C)(i) to the\r\ncircumstances of this case.  See Civil v. INS, 140 F.3d. 52, 58\r\n(1st Cir. 1998).\r\nFed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) codifies the traditional rule of\r\ngrand jury secrecy.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).  Under subsection \r\n6(e)(2) grand jurors, attorneys for the government, and other\r\npersonnel attached to the grand jury, are prohibited from\r\ndisclosing matters occurring before the grand jury.  See Fed. R.\r\nCrim. P. 6(e)(2).  Of course, there are exceptions to this general\r\nrule, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3), and the government and Conley\r\ndisagree with respect to which exception (if any) applies here.\r\nConley contends that pursuant to subsection\r\n6(e)(3)(C)(i), see supra n.9, the government was required to\r\npetition the district court for a disclosure order before calling\r\nMs. LaBelle to testify at trial as to the scope of the grand jury\r\ninquiry.  Conley argues that the government's failure to comply\r\nwith the specific procedures set forth in subsection 6(e)(3)(D),\r\nsee supra n.9, constitutes reversible error.  The government\r\nasserts that it was under no obligation to petition the court for\r\nan order of disclosure because it was entitled under 6(e)(3)(A)(i)\r\nto disclosure as a matter of course.  We agree with the\r\ngovernment.\r\nSubsection 6(e)(3)(A)(i) authorizes disclosure as a\r\nmatter of course, without any court order, to \"an attorney for the\r\ngovernment for use in the performance of such attorney's duty.\" \r\nClearly, government attorneys have a duty to prosecute perjury\r\nbefore a grand jury.  In the performance of this duty, \"it has been \r\nstandard practice for government attorneys to use the transcript of\r\nthe grand jury proceedings in preparing a case for trial,\r\nrefreshing the recollection of government witnesses, impeaching\r\nwitnesses at trial, and prosecuting for perjury before the grand\r\njury.\"  Wright &amp; Miller, 1 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Crim. 3d  107\r\n(1999).  No court order is or has been required for this type of\r\ndisclosure.  See id.; see also United States v. Garca, 420 F.2d\r\n309, 311 (2d Cir. 1970) (\"No purpose would be served by requiring\r\nthe court to approve a use of grand jury minutes which is implicit\r\nin the duties of the United States Attorney.\").  Although we have\r\nfound no case law upholding the specific right of government\r\nattorneys to similarly call grand jurors to testify as witnesses at\r\ntrial without prior court approval, we conclude that this means of\r\nfulfilling the government attorney's duty also falls within the\r\nscope of (A)(i).\r\nIn this case, Ms. LaBelle disclosed to the government\r\nattorney information concerning the scope and purpose of the grand\r\njury inquiry.  The purpose of this disclosure was to assist the\r\ngovernment attorney in the performance of his duty to prove the\r\nmateriality of Conley's statements, in order to prosecute perjury\r\nbefore the grand jury.  Such use falls squarely within the scope of\r\nRule 6(e)(3)(A)(i) and thus the government was under no obligation\r\nto obtain prior court approval.\r\n2.  The Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nThe district court's denial of Conley's motion for\r\njudgment of acquittal presents a question of law, which we review\r\nde novo.  See United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1073 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  Like the district court, \"we scrutinize the evidence\r\nin the light most compatible with the verdict, resolve all\r\ncredibility disputes in the verdict's favor, and then reach a\r\njudgment about whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.\"  United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 974 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).\r\nCount One of the indictment charges Conley with knowingly\r\nmaking false material statements before the grand jury with respect\r\nto whether he observed an individual later determined to be Officer\r\nMichael Cox, \"chase, pursue, and grab hold of a suspect as that\r\nsuspect ran toward and climbed a fence in his attempt to get away\r\nfrom police at or near Woodruff Way . . . on January 25, 1995.\" \r\nCount Three of the indictment charges Conley with corruptly\r\nendeavoring to obstruct the pending grand jury inquiry by making\r\nthose false statements.  The exchange upon which these accusations\r\nare based went as follows:\r\n         Q:     All right.  Now, officer Conley, when\r\n       you were chasing the suspect as he went\r\n       over to the fence, did you see another\r\n       individual chasing him as well?\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     Did you see anyone else in plain\r\n       clothes behind him as he went towards\r\n       the fence?\r\n         A:     No, I didn't.\r\n         Q:     Did you see, as he went on top of the\r\n       fence or climbed the fence, another\r\n       individual in plain clothes standing\r\n       there, trying to grab him? \r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     When you saw the suspect get to the top\r\n       of the fence, did you see another\r\n       individual in plain clothes grabbing\r\n       part of his clothing --\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     -- as he went over the fence?\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     So that didn't happen; is that correct? \r\n       Because you saw the individual go over\r\n       the fence?\r\n         A:     Yes, I seen [sic] the individual go\r\n       over the fence.\r\n         Q:     And if these other things that I've\r\n       been describing, a second -- another\r\n       plain clothes officer chasing him, and\r\n       actually grabbing him as he went to the\r\n       top of the fence, you would have seen\r\n       that if it happened; is that your\r\n       testimony?\r\n         A:     I think I would have seen that. \r\n\n(Tr. Vol. II at 235-36).  Conley argues that the government\r\npresented insufficient evidence at trial to prove that these\r\nstatements were false.  We disagree.\r\nThe weakness of the government's case lies in the absence\r\nof any direct evidence as to what Conley in fact observed during\r\nthe early morning hours of January 25, 1995 in the cul-de-sac at\r\nthe end of Woodruff Way.  But this weakness is not fatal.  As this\r\ncourt has recognized:\r\n  Perjury cases, like all criminal cases, are\r\nsusceptible to proof by circumstantial\r\nevidence, and in fact are peculiarly likely to\r\nbe proven in this manner because one of the\r\nelements of the crime is that the defendant\r\nknew his statement was false when he made it.\r\n\nUnited States v. Moreno Morales, 836 F.2d 684, 690 (1st Cir. 1988)\r\n(quoting United States v. Chapin, 515 F.2d 1274, 1278 (D.C. Cir.\r\n1975)).  At trial, the government presented ample circumstantial\r\nevidence from which a rational jury could conclude that Conley's\r\nstatements were false beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nBy comparing Conley's testimony about the timing and\r\nlocation of his actions with the testimony of Cox, Walker, and\r\nBrown, the jury reasonably concluded that Conley lied when he\r\nstated that he did not observe Cox chasing the suspect.  Conley\r\ntestified that upon arrival at the scene, he observed Brown exit\r\nfrom the passenger side of the Lexus, run to the right, and climb\r\nover the fence.  Most significantly, Conley testified that \"within\r\nseconds of seeing [the suspect] go over\" the fence he scaled the\r\nfence at the same location.  (Tr. Vol. III at 15; Vol. II at 239).\r\nBoth Cox and Walker placed Cox at the exact same time at\r\nthe exact same place where Conley claims to have climbed over the\r\nfence.  According to their testimony, which we must view in the\r\nlight most favorable to the verdict, see United States v. Olbres,\r\n61 F.3d 967, 970 (1st Cir. 1995), Cox was \"right behind\" Brown,\r\napproximately three feet behind him, as Brown approached the fence. \r\n(Tr. Vol. I at 77; Vol. II at 31).  When Brown reached the fence,\r\nCox was even closer.  At that point, Cox was close enough to make\r\ncontact with Brown and attempt to pull him back over the fence. \r\nBrown corroborated this version of events when he testified that a\r\nblack man wearing a \"black hoody\" was behind him as he ran toward\r\nthe fence and had just started to come over the fence after him\r\nwhen he observed the black man being struck on the head by a police\r\nofficer.  (Tr. Vol. II at 94, 97, 98).  Brown confirmed that the\r\nperson behind him was close enough to make contact with his foot as\r\nhe scaled the fence.  (See Tr. Vol. II at 96).\r\nConley's testimony that he scaled the fence \"within\r\nseconds\" of seeing Brown go over the fence, and that he scaled the\r\nfence in the same location as Brown does not square with the\r\ntestimony of Cox, Walker, and Brown.  Conley's version of the\r\nevents provides for no reasonable gap in time during which he could\r\nhave missed observing Cox at the fence.  Indeed, Conley concedes\r\nthat if the Cox/Walker/Brown version is true, he would have seen\r\nCox at the fence.  (See Tr. Vol. II at 236).  In reaching its\r\nverdict, the jury apparently found the Cox/Walker/Brown version\r\nmore credible.\r\nOur role on review is limited.  We must \"resolve all\r\ncredibility disputes in the verdict's favor.\"  Olbres, 61 F.3d at\r\n970.  Based on the evidence, we find that the jury was entitled to\r\ncredit the testimony of Cox, Walker, and Brown, and conclude that\r\nConley's statements before the grand jury were false.  We thus\r\naffirm the district court's denial of Conley's motion for judgment\r\nof acquittal with respect to Counts One and Three.3.  Fed. R. Evid. 106\r\nConley next contends that the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion in admitting into evidence excerpts of the transcript of\r\nhis grand jury testimony, then denying his request to admit the\r\ntranscript in its entirety for the purpose of placing those\r\nexcerpts in a proper context as required by Fed. R. Evid. 106. \r\nThe government maintains, however, that despite explicit\r\nquestioning by the district court, Conley failed to articulate how\r\nor why the entire transcript would qualify or explain the excerpts\r\noffered by the government.  Therefore, the government contends\r\nthat the district court acted well within its discretion in denying\r\nConley's request.\r\nUnder prevailing federal practice, objections to\r\nevidentiary rulings must be reasonably specific in order to\r\npreserve a right to appellate review.  See United States v.\r\nHolmquist, 36 F.3d 154, 168 (1st Cir. 1994) (citing United States\r\nv. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 769 (1st Cir. 1990)).  A litigant's\r\nfailure to sufficiently articulate the grounds for an objection\r\nbars the litigant aggrieved by the ruling from raising more\r\nparticularized points for the first time on appeal.  See id.  In\r\nan attempt to avoid waiver of his Rule 106 argument under this\r\ngeneral rule of practice, Conley now maintains that the relevancy\r\nof particular portions of his grand jury transcript only became\r\napparent to him after the government's closing arguments.\r\nIn his appellate brief, Conley points for the first time\r\nto two specific portions of his grand jury transcript that he\r\nclaims should have been admitted into evidence under Rule 106. \r\nThe first excerpt contains Conley's testimony that he was\r\ninterviewed twice by Internal Affairs (\"IA\") about the Cox\r\nincident.  Conley argues that this portion should have been\r\nadmitted into evidence under Rule 106 in order to place in proper\r\ncontext the portions submitted by the government in which Conley\r\ntestified that he never identified himself to homicide detectives\r\nor the district attorney as the arresting officer on the scene on\r\nthe night of the Cox incident.  The government submitted this\r\nevidence to suggest that Conley did not want to be identified as a\r\nwitness to the Cox incident.  The problem with Conley's Rule 106\r\nargument is two-fold.  First, it is clear from the opening\r\nstatements that Conley was aware that the government intended to\r\nintroduce this evidence and to advance this theory of guilt. \r\nThus, we find no reason to make an exception to our general rule of\r\nwaiver.  Second, even if we did allow Conley to make this argument\r\nfor the first time on appeal, we are not convinced that the\r\ndistrict court's exclusion of this part of the transcript was\r\nerror.  We fail to see how testimony to the effect that Conley was\r\ninterviewed by Internal Affairs, and wrote a report of the incident\r\npursuant to an order by the IA investigators, adds to the\r\nevidentiary value of the admitted excerpts.  In our view, a more\r\nrelevant portion of the transcript from a Rule 106 perspective was\r\nConley's explanation as to why he did not notify the homicide\r\ninvestigators or the district attorney's office of the arrest, and\r\nthis portion appropriately was introduced into evidence.\r\nThe second portion of his grand jury testimony that\r\nConley claims should have been admitted is testimony concerning\r\nConley's relationship with Officers Burgio and Williams.  At trial,\r\nthe government presented excerpts of Conley's grand jury testimony\r\nin order to suggest that Conley lied about his involvement in the\r\nCox incident because he wanted to protect his friends, Officers\r\nBurgio and Williams.  The government's submitted excerpts, however,\r\nincluded Conley's testimony to the effect that Officer Burgio was\r\nnot a friend of Conley's, (See Tr. Vol. II at 246), and that\r\nalthough Conley became acquainted with Officer Williams at the\r\npolice academy, he did not socialize or \"go out for drinks\" with\r\nhim.  (Tr. Vol. III at 10).  The inclusion of additional testimony\r\nbearing on this issue was not necessary to place the government's\r\nexcerpts in proper context under Fed. R. Evid. 106.\r\nIn making determinations as to the completeness of\r\nproffered statements, the district court's judgment is entitled to\r\ngreat respect.  See United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1283\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  We conclude that the district court acted well\r\nwithin its discretion in denying Conley's request that the entire\r\ntranscript of his grand jury testimony be admitted into evidence.\r\n4.  The Jury's Request for a Ruler\r\nDuring jury deliberations, the district judge received a\r\nnote from the jury requesting a ruler.  Over Conley's objection,\r\nthe district judge granted the jury's request, and instructed the\r\njury that the ruler was only to be used on exhibits which contained\r\nan approximate scale for measurement.  Conley contends that the\r\ndistrict judge's decision to provide the jury with a ruler violated\r\nhis right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United\r\nStates Constitution, and requires reversal of his conviction.\r\nAt the outset we note our disagreement with the\r\ngovernment's characterization of a ruler as merely another generic\r\ntool to aid a jury in examining exhibits.  A diagram based on an\r\napproximate scale contains, by definition, imprecise distances and\r\ndimensions.  Therefore, pursuant to the district judge's\r\ninstructions, the jury was using the ruler to obtain more precise\r\ninformation from an exhibit that was imprecise.  The use of a ruler\r\nunder these circumstances is inherently different from the jury's\r\nuse of a magnifying glass to more clearly observe photographs or\r\nfingerprints admitted into evidence.  See, e.g., United States  v.\r\nGeorge, 56 F.3d 1078, 1084 (9th Cir. 1995) (jury used magnifying\r\nglass to examine fingerprint cards and gun); United States v.\r\nYoung, 814 F.2d 392, 396 (7th Cir. 1987) (jury used magnifying\r\nglass to examine photographs).\r\nThe weakness in Conley's argument, however, is that it\r\nfails to address the root of the problem: the original admission of\r\nthe exhibit containing the approximate scale.  At trial, Conley\r\nnever objected to the admission of Exhibits 7 or 7A, nor does he\r\nmake such objection on appeal.  If, as Conley suggests, the\r\ndistances and special dimensions of the area at Woodruff Way were\r\ncritical to the government's charge that Conley must have seen Cox\r\nas Conley pursued Brown, Conley should have made a contemporaneous\r\nobjection to the admission of such an imprecise depiction of the\r\ncrime scene.\r\nA district judge's decision to provide a jury with\r\nrequested material to aid in its examination of the evidence is\r\nreviewed for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Rengifo,\r\n789 F.2d 975, 983 (1st Cir. 1986).  Under the circumstances of this\r\ncase, we cannot conclude that the district judge abused his\r\ndiscretion in granting the jury's request for a ruler.  As the\r\ndistrict judge reasoned, once the diagram was admitted into\r\nevidence, the jury's request for a ruler was both forseeable and\r\nreasonable.  Moreover, even if the request had been denied, there\r\nwas nothing to prevent the jury from simply making its own, perhaps\r\neven more inaccurate, ruler.  Therefore, we conclude that the\r\ndistrict judge acted within his discretion when he granted the\r\njury's request.\r\n5.  Sentencing Issues\r\nConley's main claim of sentencing error is that the\r\ndistrict court erred in calculating his base offense level by\r\ncross-referencing to the sentencing guideline applicable to the\r\nunderlying offense of aggravated assault.  We review the district\r\ncourt's factual determinations under the sentencing guidelines for\r\nclear error.  See United States v. Nez, 146 F.3d 36, 40 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).  However, we review the district court's construction of a\r\nsentencing guideline and its application of the guideline to the\r\nfacts de novo.  See id.\r\nThe Sentencing Guidelines generally provide a base\r\noffense level of twelve for perjury and obstruction of justice. \r\nSee U.S.S.G  2J1.2(a) &amp; 2J1.3(a).  However, if the defendant\r\ncommitted perjury \"in respect to a criminal offense,\" or obstructed\r\n\"the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense,\" the\r\nGuidelines direct the district court to use a cross-reference and\r\nsentence the defendant as an accessory after the fact \"in respect\r\nto that criminal offense.\"  U.S.S.G.  2J1.2(c)(1) &amp; 2J1.3(c)(1). \r\nPursuant to these provisions, the district court cross-referenced\r\nto  2X3.1, the guideline applicable to those convicted of being\r\naccessories after the fact.  Section 2X3.1(a) provides a base\r\noffense level \"6 levels lower than the offense level for the\r\nunderlying offense.\"  U.S.S.G.  2X3.1(a).  The district court\r\nconcluded that the \"underlying offense\" was the violation of\r\nconstitutional rights by the intentional use of excessive force by\r\npolice officers, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  241 &amp; 242, and\r\nreferred to the applicable sentencing guideline found at  2H1.1. \r\nOn appeal, Conley does not challenge this initial cross-reference\r\nfrom  2X3.1(a), to the civil rights guideline found at  2H1.1. \r\nRather, Conley challenges the district court's subsequent cross-\r\nreference from  2H1.1(a)(1) to the sentencing guideline applicable\r\nto the underlying offense of aggravated assault, found at  2A2.2.\r\nThe crux of Conley's argument is that his acquittal on\r\nCount Two of the indictment, which charged Conley with lying about\r\nseeing Cox being beaten by Boston police officers, means that the \r\nunderlying offense for which he is sentenced as an accessory after\r\nthe fact cannot include the intentional use of excessive force. \r\nConley argues that because he was only convicted of lying about\r\nseeing Cox chase the suspect to the fence and grab at him as he\r\nscaled the fence, the offense for which he is sentenced as an\r\naccessory after the fact should only include the other\r\nconstitutional deprivations alleged in the indictment: namely, the\r\nfailure to prevent the assault, and the failure to provide medical\r\ncare.  Because these offenses are not referenced by the guidelines\r\nor by statute as separate underlying offenses, but rather are\r\nsubcategories of the civil rights offense, Conley contends that\r\n2H1.1(a)(3) -- and not  2H1.1(a)(1) -- should apply.  We\r\ndisagree.\r\nConley's acquittal on Count Two has no bearing on what\r\noffenses were under investigation when he testified before the\r\ngrand jury.  As the background section to the obstruction of\r\njustice guideline indicates, the cross-reference to  2X3.1 (the\r\naccessory after the fact guideline) is intended to provide an\r\nenhanced offense level for the crime of obstruction of justice when\r\nthe obstruction is in respect to a particularly serious offense. \r\nSee Commentary to U.S.S.G.  2J1.2(c)(1).  Consistent with this\r\npurpose, the application of the cross-reference does not depend on\r\nthe defendant's actual conviction as an accessory after the fact to\r\nthe offense under investigation.  See United States v. Martnez,\r\n106 F.3d 620, 621-22 (5th Cir. 1997);  United States v. Dickerson,\r\n114 F.3d 464, 467 (4th Cir. 1997); United States v. Gay, 44 F.3d\r\n93, 95 (2d Cir. 1994).  Indeed, application of this cross-\r\nreference does not even depend on the defendant's specific\r\nknowledge of the underlying offense:\r\n  [A defendant's] lack of knowledge of the\r\nspecific offenses under investigation is\r\nirrelevant.  Neither  2J1.2(c)(1) nor  2X3.1\r\nrequires such knowledge as a prerequisite to\r\napplication of the offense level for the\r\n'underlying offense.'  All that is required is\r\nthat the 'offense involved obstructing the\r\ninvestigation or prosecution of a criminal\r\noffense . . . .'   2J1.2(c)(1). [The\r\ndefendant] knew there was a federal grand jury\r\ninvestigation into criminal offenses and that\r\nhe knowingly and willfully attempted to\r\nobstruct it as the jury so found.  This is\r\nenough to trigger the cross-referencing\r\nprovisions of the guidelines.\r\n\nUnited States v. McQueen, 86 F.3d 180, 184 (1st Cir. 1996).  Conley\r\nknew even more than the defendant in McQueen.  Conley knew that the\r\ngrand jury was investigating the assault on Michael Cox by Boston\r\npolice officers, and the trial jury found that he knowingly and\r\nwillfully obstructed that investigation.  The fact that Conley was\r\nacquitted on Count Two is irrelevant for cross-referencing\r\npurposes.\r\nConley further argues that the use of aggravated assault\r\nas the \"underlying offense\" under  2H1.1(a)(1) is barred by the\r\nplain language of the Commentary to this guideline.  The Commentary\r\nto  2H1.1(a)(1) states: \"'Offense guideline applicable to any\r\nunderlying offense' means the offense guideline applicable to any\r\nconduct established by the offense of conviction that constitutes\r\nan offense under federal, state, or local law.\"  Conley contends\r\nthat his offenses of conviction are perjury and obstruction of\r\njustice, and that the only conduct established by these convictions\r\nis that he lied before the grand jury about observing Cox chase the\r\nsuspect as he ran towards the fence.  As discussed supra, the\r\npurpose of the cross-reference in both the perjury and obstruction\r\nof justice guidelines is to measure the gravity of those offenses. \r\nWe conclude that  2H1.1(a)(1) is similarly employed, and that the\r\nsentencing court need not look exclusively to the offense of\r\nconviction.  This conclusion makes logical sense.  As other courts\r\nhave observed, if the \"underlying offense\" was required to be the\r\noffense of conviction, perjurers and obstructors of justice would\r\nbenefit from perjury or obstruction that successfully persuaded a\r\ngrand jury not to return an indictment.  See United States v.\r\nDickerson, 114 F.3d 464, 468 (4th Cir. 1997); McQueen, 86 F.3d at\r\n183.  The Commentary on which Conley relies relates to the\r\nsubstantive offenses involving individual rights.  These notes are\r\nnot relevant under the circumstances presented here because  2H1.1\r\n(a)(1) is being used simply as a formula for the perjury and\r\nobstruction of justice offenses.\r\nFinally, Conley's argument ignores the specific finding\r\nof the district judge that Conley\r\n  observed through his senses of sight and\r\nhearing enough to believe that Cox was being\r\nstruck by other police officers and that his\r\nanswering in a misleading and incomplete way\r\nthe questions that were asked before the grand\r\njury was obstructing the grand jury's\r\ninvestigation to determine whether criminal\r\nconduct of Boston Police Officers on the scene\r\nhad occurred.\r\n\n(Tr. of Disposition Hr'g at 6). We review such factual findings\r\nonly for clear error.  See Nez, 146 F.3d at 40.  Based on the\r\nevidence presented at trial, see supra, this finding does not\r\nconstitute clear error.  Moreover, this finding further supports\r\nthe district court's cross-reference to the underlying offense of\r\naggravated assault.\r\nWe next address Conley's objections to the district\r\ncourt's application of specific offense characteristics under the\r\naggravated assault guideline.  In opposing these enhancements,\r\nConley repeats the argument that his acquittal on Count Two bars\r\nthe court from enhancing his offense level based on the specific\r\ncharacteristics identified in the aggravated assault guideline. \r\nFor the same reasons that we uphold the district court's cross-\r\nreference to the underlying offense of aggravated assault, we\r\nuphold the district court's application of the specific offense\r\ncharacteristics provided for under the same guideline.\r\nConley raises the same argument with respect to the\r\ndistrict court's application of a six level enhancement based on\r\nthe specific offense characteristic provided for under  2H1.1(b),\r\nnamely, that the underlying offense was committed under color of\r\nlaw.  Again, for the same reasons that we uphold the district\r\ncourt's initial cross-reference to  2H1.1(a), we uphold its\r\napplication of the six level enhancement pursuant to  2H1.1(b).\r\nFinally, Conley argues that the district court erred in\r\ndenying his request for a four level reduction based on his role as\r\na minimal participant in the underlying offenses.  See U.S.S.G.\r\n3B1.2(a).  In support of his request for such a reduction, Conley\r\nargued that the relevant criminal activity was the aggravated\r\nassault on Officer Cox.  The district court concluded, however,\r\nthat the relevant criminal activity for purposes of  3B1.2 was\r\nConley's perjury and obstruction of justice.  We agree with the\r\ndistrict court.  We reiterate that the district court's\r\ncharacterization of the underlying offense as a civil rights\r\nviolation, and, more specifically, as aggravated assault, was for\r\nthe limited purpose of measuring the gravity of Conley's perjury\r\nand obstruction of justice offenses.  For all other purposes,\r\nConley's offenses of conviction remain perjury and obstruction of\r\njustice.  Clearly, the district court did not err in concluding\r\nthat Conley was not a \"minimal participant\" in these criminal\r\nactivities.\r\n                          CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the defendant's conviction is\r\naffirmed.\n",

The underlying case in this\r\nappeal stems from an April 1997 federal grand jury investigation\r\ninto an incident in which Michael Cox, a plain clothes Boston\r\npolice officer, was allegedly mistaken for a fleeing suspect and\r\nbeaten by unknown police officers in violation of 18 U.S.C.  242. \r\nOn May 29, 1997, defendant-appellant Kenneth Conley, a Boston\r\npolice officer at the scene of the incident, testified before the\r\ngrand jury pursuant to an immunity order.  Conley was subsequently\r\nconvicted of perjury and obstruction of justice as a result of his\r\ngrand jury testimony and was sentenced to thirty-four months\r\nimprisonment and a $6,000 fine.  Conley now appeals his conviction.\r\n                          BACKGROUND\r\nAt approximately 2:30 a.m. on January 25, 1995, a\r\nshooting occurred at a restaurant on Blue Hill Avenue in the Grove\r\nHall section of Boston.  It was mistakenly broadcast over the\r\npolice radio that the victim of the shooting was a Boston police\r\nofficer.  The suspects were described as four black males driving\r\na gold Lexus.  The mistaken broadcast of a police officer down\r\ngenerated a massive response by police cruisers from several\r\ndifferent districts.  A chase ensued.\r\nThe suspects led the police on a lengthy car chase\r\nspanning three police districts and several towns.  The closest\r\npolice vehicle behind the Lexus throughout most of the chase was an\r\nunmarked police cruiser occupied by plain clothes officers Craig\r\nJones and Michael Cox.  Jones was the driver of the vehicle, and \r\nCox occupied the passenger seat.\r\nThe car chase finally ended when the suspects drove down\r\na dead end street known as Woodruff Way in Mattapan.  When the\r\nsuspects arrived at the cul-de-sac at the end of Woodruff Way, the\r\nJones/Cox unmarked cruiser was the first police car on the scene,\r\nand skidded to a stop on the left side of the Lexus.  The second\r\npolice cruiser to arrive was occupied by uniformed officers David\r\nWilliams and James Burgio.  Williams and Burgio pulled in on the\r\nright side of the Lexus.  Uniformed officer Ian Daley arrived next,\r\nand pulled in directly behind the Lexus.  Immediately behind Daley\r\nwas uniformed officer Richard Walker, followed by defendant-\r\nappellant Conley and his partner, Robert Dwan.  The Conley/Dwan\r\nvehicle was thus the fifth police vehicle on the scene.  Conley and\r\nDwan wore plain clothes and occupied an unmarked police vehicle.\r\nAs the gold Lexus came to a stop at the end of Woodruff\r\nWay, Cox observed one of the suspects, later identified as Robert\r\nBrown, exit the gold Lexus from the passenger side, and run to the\r\nright, towards a fence.  In pursuit, Cox exited his vehicle from\r\nthe passenger side, ran behind the Lexus, and followed the suspect\r\nto the right, towards the fence.  Cox described the suspect as a\r\nblack male wearing a brown leather jacket.  Cox, also black, was\r\nwearing jeans, a black hooded sweatshirt, and a three-quarter\r\nlength black down jacket.\r\nCox chased the suspect to the fence, approximately twenty\r\nfeet away.  During the chase, Cox was \"about three feet\" behind the\r\nsuspect.  (Tr. Vol. II at 31).  When the suspect got to the fence,\r\nthe suspect began climbing over it, catching his jacket for a\r\nmoment on the top.  At that moment, Cox reached up and attempted to\r\ngrab the suspect and pull him back over the fence.  Cox testified\r\nthat approximately two seconds elapsed between the time that the\r\nsuspect caught his jacket on the top of the fence and the time when\r\nCox grabbed the suspect's jacket in an attempt to pull him back\r\nover the fence.  (See Tr. Vol. II at 14, 76).  Cox's attempt\r\nfailed, however, and the suspect dropped down on the other side of\r\nthe fence and started to run.  Cox did not observe anyone else\r\nclimb over the fence between him and the suspect.\r\nAfter the suspect landed on the other side, Cox took a\r\nstep back from the fence, considering for a moment whether to\r\nfollow over the fence.  A moment later, Cox placed both his hands\r\nup on the fence, as if to go over.  At that point, Cox felt a sharp\r\nblow on the back of his head, like a metal pipe.  The next thing he\r\nknew he was on the ground on his hands and knees, trying to get up. \r\nHe observed a white male standing in front of him, wearing boots\r\nand a dark uniform.  Cox was repeatedly kicked in the head, back,\r\nface, and mouth by several different people all at once.  The\r\nbeating did not stop until Cox heard someone yell: \"Stop, stop,\r\nhe's a cop, he's a cop.\"  (Tr. Vol. I at 88).  When the kicking\r\nfinally stopped, Cox attempted to get up from the ground.  When he\r\nlooked up, he realized that there was no one around to assist him. \r\nCox was forced to use the bumper of a police car to pull himself up\r\nfrom the ground.\r\nIn April 1997, a federal grand jury commenced an\r\ninvestigation into the beating of Officer Michael Cox.  The grand\r\njury sought to determine the identity of the officers who attacked\r\nMichael Cox and/or deliberately failed to prevent the assault and \r\nto get medical attention for him once they knew he was injured.  On\r\nMay 29, 1997, defendant-appellant Conley, an officer present at the\r\nscene, was called before the grand jury to recount the events he\r\nobserved and the actions he took at Woodruff Way in the early\r\nmorning hours of January 25, 1995.\r\nConsistent with Cox's version of events, Conley testified \r\nthat when he arrived at the dead end on Woodruff Way, his vehicle\r\nwas about the fourth or fifth police car in line behind the\r\nsuspects' gold Lexus, approximately forty feet away.  (See Tr. Vol.\r\nII at 229-30, 232).  Also consistent with Cox's account, Conley\r\ntestified that once the Lexus skidded to a stop, a black male\r\nwearing a brown leather jacket exited from the passenger side of\r\nthe Lexus and ran to the right, towards a fence.  Conley exited his\r\nvehicle in pursuit.  While in pursuit, Conley observed the suspect\r\nscale the fence, drop down on the other side, and start to run. \r\n(See id. at 233).\r\nConley testified that he made all of these observations\r\nas he pursued the suspect, beginning from the time the suspect\r\nfirst exited the gold Lexus up to the time when the suspect landed\r\non the other side of the fence and started to run.  According to\r\nCox's testimony, Conley made these observations at precisely the\r\nsame time that Cox was chasing \"right behind\" the suspect.  (Tr.\r\nVol. I at 77).  However, before the grand jury, Conley testified\r\nthat during that time he did not observe anyone -- either in plain\r\nclothes or in uniform -- between him and the suspect.  In direct\r\nconflict with Cox's account, Conley testified as follows:\r\n         Q:     All right.  Now, officer Conley, when\r\n       you were chasing the suspect as he went\r\n       over to the fence, did you see another\r\n       individual chasing him as well?\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     Did you see anyone else in plain\r\n       clothes behind him as he went towards\r\n       the fence?\r\n         A:     No, I didn't.\r\n         Q:     Did you see, as he went on top of the\r\n       fence or climbed the fence, another\r\n       individual in plain clothes standing\r\n       there, trying to grab him? \r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     When you saw the suspect get to the top\r\n       of the fence, did you see another\r\n       individual in plain clothes grabbing\r\n       part of his clothing --\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     -- as he went over the fence?\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     So that didn't happen; is that correct? \r\n       Because you saw the individual go over\r\n       the fence?\r\n         A:     Yes, I seen [sic] the individual go\r\n       over the fence.\r\n         Q:     And if these other things that I've\r\n       been describing, a second -- another\r\n       plain clothes officer chasing him, and\r\n       actually grabbing him as he went to the\r\n       top of the fence, you would have seen\r\n       that if it happened; is that your\r\n       testimony?\r\n         A:     I think I would have seen that. \r\n(Tr. Vol. II at 235-36).  Conley further testified that when he got\r\nto the fence, he climbed over it in \"approximately the same\r\nlocation\" that he had observed the suspect go over the fence, and\r\ncontinued in pursuit.  (Id. at 239).  Eventually, after chasing the\r\nsuspect for approximately one mile, Conley apprehended him and\r\neffected an arrest.\r\nTwo other individuals, present at the scene, testified at\r\nConley's trial: Officer Walker, and the suspect, Robert Brown. \r\nOfficer Walker corroborated Cox's version of events up to the point\r\nwhen the suspect climbed over the fence and dropped down on the\r\nother side:\r\n         Q:     Did you see - did Officer Cox reach for\r\n       the person on the fence?\r\n         A:     Yes, he did.\r\n         Q:     What did the person who went over the\r\n       fence do once they went over the fence?\r\n         A:     Once he went over the fence, he fell.\r\n                              . . . \r\n         Q:     What did Officer Cox do once the person\r\n       went over the fence?\r\n         A:     I don't know.\r\n\n(Tr. Vol. II at 32).  After observing the suspect fall on the other\r\nside of the fence, Walker ran from his car straight ahead to a hole\r\nin the fence.  Walker did not see Cox put his hands on the fence,\r\nas if to go over.  The last thing Walker saw Cox do was reach for\r\nthe suspect caught on the fence.  (See id. at 33).\r\nOnce through the hole in the fence, Walker ran to the\r\nright, in pursuit of the fleeing suspect.  As he ran, he came upon\r\ntwo white, plain clothes police officers standing in the street. \r\nWalker testified that no one had passed by him from the time that\r\nhe ran through the hole in the fence to the time when he\r\nencountered the two white police officers.  He did not know where\r\nthe two officers had come from; he had not observed them jump over\r\nthe fence.  The taller of the two officers asked Walker whether he\r\nhad a light, and when Walker responded that he did not, the taller\r\nofficer took off running.  Walker followed, approximately two yards\r\nbehind.  (See Tr. Vol. II at 67).\r\nDuring the chase, the tall white officer in front of\r\nWalker dropped his radio.  Walker stopped to pick up the radio, and\r\nthen continued in pursuit.  When the tall white officer finally\r\napprehended the suspect, Walker returned his radio to him.  At\r\ntrial, Walker testified that the tall white officer was\r\napproximately the same height and size as defendant-appellant\r\nConley.\r\nRobert Brown, the suspect wearing the brown leather\r\njacket who was allegedly pursued by both Cox and Conley, also\r\ntestified at trial.  Brown corroborated much of Cox's account.  He\r\ntestified that when the Lexus skidded to a stop at the end of\r\nWoodruff Way, he exited the vehicle from the rear passenger side,\r\nand headed to the right, towards the fence.  He further testified\r\nthat as he ran towards the fence, he looked back and saw a black\r\nman wearing black clothing running behind him.  When he arrived at\r\nthe fence, Brown flipped over it, catching his jacket on the top. \r\nBrown stated that as he attempted to free his jacket from the top\r\nof the fence, he felt somebody touch his foot.  Once he became free\r\nof the fence, Brown fell backwards down a hill, ran into a tree,\r\nand split his tooth in half.  Dazed and confused, Brown remained on\r\nthe ground for a moment and observed a black man wearing a \"black\r\nhoody\" start to \"go for the fence.\"  (Tr. Vol. II at 97-8).  As the\r\nman grabbed for the fence, Brown observed a police officer hit the\r\nman twice on the back of the head with a billy club or a\r\nflashlight, something \"shaped like a pipe.\"  (Id. at 98).  Brown\r\ndescribed the police officer as a tall, black man with a mustache,\r\nwearing a Boston police uniform and a badge.\r\nBrown next observed a second officer come over to the\r\nfence to assist the tall black officer in wrestling the black man\r\nto the ground.  Once the man was down on the ground, Brown\r\ntestified that approximately three or four other police officers --\r\nuniformed and plain clothes -- came over to the fence and began to\r\nkick the man.  At this point, Brown stood up to run.  As he stood\r\nup, Brown made eye contact with a tall white officer on the other\r\nside of the fence.  Brown testified that he did not observe this\r\nwhite officer kick the man on the ground.\r\nOnce the tall white officer made eye contact with Brown,\r\nBrown began to run, and the white officer followed.  Eventually,\r\nthe white officer caught Brown and arrested him.  At trial, Brown\r\ntestified that the arresting officer was the same tall white\r\nofficer he had made eye contact with through the fence.\r\nOn August 14, 1997, Conley was charged in a three-count\r\nindictment arising from his grand jury testimony.  Count One\r\ncharged that Conley committed perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\r\n1623, by denying that he saw Cox chase, pursue, and grab hold of\r\na suspect as that suspect ran toward and climbed the fence at\r\nWoodruff Way.  Count Two charged that Conley also committed perjury\r\nby denying that he saw Boston police officers strike and kick Cox. \r\nCount Three charged that Conley obstructed and endeavored to\r\nobstruct the grand jury investigation by giving false, evasive, and\r\nmisleading testimony and withholding information, in violation of\r\n18 U.S.C.  1503.  On June 10, the jury returned verdicts of guilty\r\non Counts One and Three and not guilty on Count Two.  \r\n                          DISCUSSION\r\nOn appeal, Conley raises several challenges to his\r\nconviction.  We address each of his challenges in turn.\r\n1.  The Testimony of the Grand Juror\r\nTitle 18 U.S.C.  1623 states, in relevant part:\r\n  Whoever under oath . . . in any proceeding\r\nbefore or ancillary to any court or grand jury\r\nof the United States knowingly makes any false\r\nmaterial declaration . . . shall be fined not\r\nmore than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than\r\nfive years, or both.\r\n\n18 U.S.C.  1623.  It is uncontested that a conviction under  1623\r\nrequires that the statements made be \"material\" to the proceeding,\r\nhere a grand jury investigation.  See id.  It is also uncontested\r\nthat \"materiality\" is an element that the government bears the\r\nburden of proving.  The question presented by defendant-appellant\r\nConley is whether the district court erred in allowing the\r\ngovernment to prove this element by calling Jeanne LaBelle, a\r\nmember of the grand jury that investigated the Cox incident, to\r\ntestify as to the scope and purpose of the grand jury's\r\ninvestigation.  Conley contends that the district court erred in\r\nadmitting Ms. LaBelle's testimony, and that such error warrants\r\nreversal of his conviction.  We disagree.\r\nA.  Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)\r\nBefore this court, Conley argues for the first time that\r\nthe admission of Ms. LaBelle's testimony violated Fed. R. Evid.\r\n606(b).  Although Conley objected to the admission of\r\nMs. LaBelle's testimony on other grounds, Conley never raised the\r\napplicability of Rule 606(b) before the district court.  \"Our law\r\nis clear that a party ordinarily may not raise on appeal issues\r\nthat were not seasonably advanced (and, hence preserved) below.\" \r\nCooperman v. Individual, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762535\"><a href=\"/opinion/762535/fed-sec-l-rep-p-90450-steven-g-cooperman-v-individual-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50 (1st Cir. 1999)\r\n(quoting Daigle v.

We see no reason to depart from this well-\r\nestablished rule in this case.  We thus decline to address Conley's\r\nRule 606(b) argument, except to say that plain error is plainly\r\nabsent.\r\nB.  Fed. R. Evid. 403\r\nConley next claims that the district court erred in\r\nadmitting Ms. LaBelle's testimony because its probative value was\r\nsubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.  See\r\nFed. R. Evid. 403.  Specifically, Conley argues that the admission\r\nof the testimony of a grand juror who voted to return an indictment\r\nagainst him was unfairly prejudicial in that it called upon the\r\npetit jury to evaluate the credibility of a grand juror.  Conley\r\ncontends that because of the \"natural tendency\" of the petit jury\r\nto identify with the grand juror, the petit jury inevitably gave\r\nundue weight and credence to Ms. LaBelle's testimony.  Conley\r\nfurther argues that the admission of Ms. LaBelle's testimony\r\nunfairly prejudiced his case because it caused the jury to confuse\r\nthe standards of proof governing the grand jury decision to indict\r\nand the petit jury decision to convict, respectively.  Finally,\r\nConley claims that the government's use of the testimony of a\r\nmember of the grand jury that returned an indictment against him,\r\nviolated his presumption of innocence in that it called upon the\r\njury to infer guilt from the fact of his indictment.  For all of\r\nthese reasons, Conley maintains that the admission of Ms. LaBelle's\r\ntestimony should have been excluded under Fed. R. Evid. 403.\r\nWe review the district court's Rule 403 determination for\r\nabuse of discretion.  See United States v. Cruz-Kuilan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196554\"><a href=\"/opinion/196554/united-states-v-cruz-quilan/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n61 (1st Cir. 1996).  We note that \"[o]nly rarely -- and in\r\nextraordinarily compelling circumstances -- will we, from the vista\r\nof a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot\r\njudgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and\r\nunfair effect.\"  United States v.

See United States v. Santagata, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"555052\"><a href=\"/opinion/555052/united-states-v-donald-santagata/\"><span class=\"volume\">924</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394 (1st Cir. 1991) (where pleadings and record evidence\r\nshow that court was aware of its Rule 403 responsibility, express\r\nfindings not necessary).  As the district court noted, the\r\ntestimony of Ms. LaBelle was clearly relevant to materiality. \r\nMs. LaBelle testified as to the scope and purpose of the grand jury\r\ninquiry:\r\n  We were investigating an assault that took\r\nplace on Officer Michael Cox on January 25th\r\nof 1995, and we were trying to establish the\r\nidentity of officers who participated in the\r\nattack.  We were trying to determine if there\r\nwas excessive force used, and also we were\r\ntrying to determine who the officers were who\r\ndeliberately failed to get medical attention\r\nonce they knew that he had been injured.\r\n\n(Tr. Vol. III at 114).  Ms. LaBelle further testified that\r\ndefendant-appellant Conley was one of approximately forty-five\r\nofficers called to testify before the grand jury, and that after\r\nConley's testimony the grand jury did not have any more evidence\r\nconcerning the identity of the officers who beat Cox or the\r\nidentity of any witnesses to the beating.  Finally, Ms. LaBelle\r\ntestified that at the time she ended her service as a grand juror,\r\nthe grand jury had not returned any indictments for the assault of\r\nMichael Cox.  Ms. LaBelle's testimony was probative in the sense\r\nthat it provided a context for Conley's allegedly false statements\r\nfrom which the jury could infer materiality.\r\nWe next consider Conley's assertions of prejudicial\r\neffect.  Conley offers no evidence to support his theory that the\r\npetit jurors were improperly influenced by their sense of identity\r\nor \"camaraderie\" with Ms. LaBelle.  Absent such evidence, we cannot\r\nconclude that the mere possibility that some sort of bonding\r\noccurred between the petit jury and Ms. LaBelle substantially\r\noutweighs the probative value of Ms. LaBelle's testimony. \r\nMoreover, as the government points out, the petit jury's split\r\nverdict undermines Conley's theory of improper influence.  See\r\nUnited States v.

Any risk of juror confusion\r\nconcerning the appropriate standard of proof was minimized by the\r\ndistrict judge's thorough instructions concerning the presumption\r\nof innocence and the government's burden to prove its case beyond\r\na reasonable doubt.  In addition, the district judge made it\r\nabundantly clear to the jurors on several different occasions that\r\nthe indictment returned by the grand jury \"is in no sense a part of\r\nthe evidence that you will consider as you consider whether the\r\ngovernment has met its heavy burden of proof of guilt beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.\"  (Tr. Vol. I at 32).  Finally, the district\r\njudge explicitly requested Conley to submit any additions to the\r\nproposed jury instructions \"in order to make it clear that in no\r\nway does receiving any testimony make the indictment a part of the\r\nevidence that the jury is to consider.\"  (Tr. Vol. III at 71). \r\nConley failed to submit any such suggestions and cannot now\r\ncomplain of unfair prejudice.\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, we conclude that the\r\ndistrict court acted well within its discretion in allowing the\r\ngovernment to call Ms. LaBelle to testify as to the scope of the\r\ngrand jury investigation for the purpose of proving the materiality\r\nof Conley's statements.\r\nC.  Fed. R. Crim P. 6(e)(2)\r\nConley next alleges that the district court erred by\r\npermitting Ms. LaBelle to testify because the government failed to\r\npetition the court in advance for a disclosure order as required by\r\nFed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(C)(i) &amp; (D).  We review Conley's claim de\r\nnovo to the extent that he raises a legal issue with respect to the\r\napplicability of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(C)(i) to the\r\ncircumstances of this case.  See Civil v. INS, 140 F.3d. 52, 58\r\n(1st Cir. 1998).\r\nFed. R. Crim. P. 6(e) codifies the traditional rule of\r\ngrand jury secrecy.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e).  Under subsection \r\n6(e)(2) grand jurors, attorneys for the government, and other\r\npersonnel attached to the grand jury, are prohibited from\r\ndisclosing matters occurring before the grand jury.  See Fed. R.\r\nCrim. P. 6(e)(2).  Of course, there are exceptions to this general\r\nrule, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3), and the government and Conley\r\ndisagree with respect to which exception (if any) applies here.\r\nConley contends that pursuant to subsection\r\n6(e)(3)(C)(i), see supra n.9, the government was required to\r\npetition the district court for a disclosure order before calling\r\nMs. LaBelle to testify at trial as to the scope of the grand jury\r\ninquiry.  Conley argues that the government's failure to comply\r\nwith the specific procedures set forth in subsection 6(e)(3)(D),\r\nsee supra n.9, constitutes reversible error.  The government\r\nasserts that it was under no obligation to petition the court for\r\nan order of disclosure because it was entitled under 6(e)(3)(A)(i)\r\nto disclosure as a matter of course.  We agree with the\r\ngovernment.\r\nSubsection 6(e)(3)(A)(i) authorizes disclosure as a\r\nmatter of course, without any court order, to \"an attorney for the\r\ngovernment for use in the performance of such attorney's duty.\" \r\nClearly, government attorneys have a duty to prosecute perjury\r\nbefore a grand jury.  In the performance of this duty, \"it has been \r\nstandard practice for government attorneys to use the transcript of\r\nthe grand jury proceedings in preparing a case for trial,\r\nrefreshing the recollection of government witnesses, impeaching\r\nwitnesses at trial, and prosecuting for perjury before the grand\r\njury.\"  Wright &amp; Miller, 1 Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Crim. 3d  107\r\n(1999).  No court order is or has been required for this type of\r\ndisclosure.  See id.; see also United States v. Garca, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"287902\"><a href=\"/opinion/287902/united-states-v-vera-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311 (2d Cir. 1970) (\"No purpose would be served by requiring\r\nthe court to approve a use of grand jury minutes which is implicit\r\nin the duties of the United States Attorney.\").  Although we have\r\nfound no case law upholding the specific right of government\r\nattorneys to similarly call grand jurors to testify as witnesses at\r\ntrial without prior court approval, we conclude that this means of\r\nfulfilling the government attorney's duty also falls within the\r\nscope of (A)(i).\r\nIn this case, Ms. LaBelle disclosed to the government\r\nattorney information concerning the scope and purpose of the grand\r\njury inquiry.  The purpose of this disclosure was to assist the\r\ngovernment attorney in the performance of his duty to prove the\r\nmateriality of Conley's statements, in order to prosecute perjury\r\nbefore the grand jury.  Such use falls squarely within the scope of\r\nRule 6(e)(3)(A)(i) and thus the government was under no obligation\r\nto obtain prior court approval.\r\n2.  The Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nThe district court's denial of Conley's motion for\r\njudgment of acquittal presents a question of law, which we review\r\nde novo.  See United States v. Czubinski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197216\"><a href=\"/opinion/197216/united-states-v-czubinski/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1069</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1073 (1st\r\nCir. 1997).  Like the district court, \"we scrutinize the evidence\r\nin the light most compatible with the verdict, resolve all\r\ncredibility disputes in the verdict's favor, and then reach a\r\njudgment about whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt.\"  United States v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 974 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).\r\nCount One of the indictment charges Conley with knowingly\r\nmaking false material statements before the grand jury with respect\r\nto whether he observed an individual later determined to be Officer\r\nMichael Cox, \"chase, pursue, and grab hold of a suspect as that\r\nsuspect ran toward and climbed a fence in his attempt to get away\r\nfrom police at or near Woodruff Way . . . on January 25, 1995.\" \r\nCount Three of the indictment charges Conley with corruptly\r\nendeavoring to obstruct the pending grand jury inquiry by making\r\nthose false statements.  The exchange upon which these accusations\r\nare based went as follows:\r\n         Q:     All right.  Now, officer Conley, when\r\n       you were chasing the suspect as he went\r\n       over to the fence, did you see another\r\n       individual chasing him as well?\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     Did you see anyone else in plain\r\n       clothes behind him as he went towards\r\n       the fence?\r\n         A:     No, I didn't.\r\n         Q:     Did you see, as he went on top of the\r\n       fence or climbed the fence, another\r\n       individual in plain clothes standing\r\n       there, trying to grab him? \r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     When you saw the suspect get to the top\r\n       of the fence, did you see another\r\n       individual in plain clothes grabbing\r\n       part of his clothing --\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     -- as he went over the fence?\r\n         A:     No, I did not.\r\n         Q:     So that didn't happen; is that correct? \r\n       Because you saw the individual go over\r\n       the fence?\r\n         A:     Yes, I seen [sic] the individual go\r\n       over the fence.\r\n         Q:     And if these other things that I've\r\n       been describing, a second -- another\r\n       plain clothes officer chasing him, and\r\n       actually grabbing him as he went to the\r\n       top of the fence, you would have seen\r\n       that if it happened; is that your\r\n       testimony?\r\n         A:     I think I would have seen that. \r\n\n(Tr. Vol. II at 235-36).  Conley argues that the government\r\npresented insufficient evidence at trial to prove that these\r\nstatements were false.  We disagree.\r\nThe weakness of the government's case lies in the absence\r\nof any direct evidence as to what Conley in fact observed during\r\nthe early morning hours of January 25, 1995 in the cul-de-sac at\r\nthe end of Woodruff Way.  But this weakness is not fatal.  As this\r\ncourt has recognized:\r\n  Perjury cases, like all criminal cases, are\r\nsusceptible to proof by circumstantial\r\nevidence, and in fact are peculiarly likely to\r\nbe proven in this manner because one of the\r\nelements of the crime is that the defendant\r\nknew his statement was false when he made it.\r\n\nUnited States v. Moreno Morales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499727\"><a href=\"/opinion/499727/united-states-v-luis-reveron-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 690 (1st Cir. 1988)\r\n(quoting United States v. Chapin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"327600\"><a href=\"/opinion/327600/united-states-v-dwight-l-chapin/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1278 (D.C. Cir.\r\n1975)).  At trial, the government presented ample circumstantial\r\nevidence from which a rational jury could conclude that Conley's\r\nstatements were false beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nBy comparing Conley's testimony about the timing and\r\nlocation of his actions with the testimony of Cox, Walker, and\r\nBrown, the jury reasonably concluded that Conley lied when he\r\nstated that he did not observe Cox chasing the suspect.  Conley\r\ntestified that upon arrival at the scene, he observed Brown exit\r\nfrom the passenger side of the Lexus, run to the right, and climb\r\nover the fence.  Most significantly, Conley testified that \"within\r\nseconds of seeing [the suspect] go over\" the fence he scaled the\r\nfence at the same location.  (Tr. Vol. III at 15; Vol. II at 239).\r\nBoth Cox and Walker placed Cox at the exact same time at\r\nthe exact same place where Conley claims to have climbed over the\r\nfence.  According to their testimony, which we must view in the\r\nlight most favorable to the verdict, see United States v. Olbres,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196204\"><a href=\"/opinion/196204/united-states-v-olbres/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 970 (1st Cir. 1995), Cox was \"right behind\" Brown,\r\napproximately three feet behind him, as Brown approached the fence. \r\n(Tr. Vol. I at 77; Vol. II at 31).  When Brown reached the fence,\r\nCox was even closer.  At that point, Cox was close enough to make\r\ncontact with Brown and attempt to pull him back over the fence. \r\nBrown corroborated this version of events when he testified that a\r\nblack man wearing a \"black hoody\" was behind him as he ran toward\r\nthe fence and had just started to come over the fence after him\r\nwhen he observed the black man being struck on the head by a police\r\nofficer.  (Tr. Vol. II at 94, 97, 98).  Brown confirmed that the\r\nperson behind him was close enough to make contact with his foot as\r\nhe scaled the fence.  (See Tr. Vol. II at 96).\r\nConley's testimony that he scaled the fence \"within\r\nseconds\" of seeing Brown go over the fence, and that he scaled the\r\nfence in the same location as Brown does not square with the\r\ntestimony of Cox, Walker, and Brown.  Conley's version of the\r\nevents provides for no reasonable gap in time during which he could\r\nhave missed observing Cox at the fence.  Indeed, Conley concedes\r\nthat if the Cox/Walker/Brown version is true, he would have seen\r\nCox at the fence.  (See Tr. Vol. II at 236).  In reaching its\r\nverdict, the jury apparently found the Cox/Walker/Brown version\r\nmore credible.\r\nOur role on review is limited.  We must \"resolve all\r\ncredibility disputes in the verdict's favor.\"  Olbres, 61 F.3d at\r\n970.  Based on the evidence, we find that the jury was entitled to\r\ncredit the testimony of Cox, Walker, and Brown, and conclude that\r\nConley's statements before the grand jury were false.  We thus\r\naffirm the district court's denial of Conley's motion for judgment\r\nof acquittal with respect to Counts One and Three.3.  Fed. R. Evid. 106\r\nConley next contends that the district court abused its\r\ndiscretion in admitting into evidence excerpts of the transcript of\r\nhis grand jury testimony, then denying his request to admit the\r\ntranscript in its entirety for the purpose of placing those\r\nexcerpts in a proper context as required by Fed. R. Evid. 106. \r\nThe government maintains, however, that despite explicit\r\nquestioning by the district court, Conley failed to articulate how\r\nor why the entire transcript would qualify or explain the excerpts\r\noffered by the government.  Therefore, the government contends\r\nthat the district court acted well within its discretion in denying\r\nConley's request.\r\nUnder prevailing federal practice, objections to\r\nevidentiary rulings must be reasonably specific in order to\r\npreserve a right to appellate review.  See United States v.\r\nHolmquist, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195622\"><a href=\"/opinion/195622/united-states-v-holmquist/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168 (1st Cir. 1994) (citing United States\r\nv.

A litigant's\r\nfailure to sufficiently articulate the grounds for an objection\r\nbars the litigant aggrieved by the ruling from raising more\r\nparticularized points for the first time on appeal.  See id.  In\r\nan attempt to avoid waiver of his Rule 106 argument under this\r\ngeneral rule of practice, Conley now maintains that the relevancy\r\nof particular portions of his grand jury transcript only became\r\napparent to him after the government's closing arguments.\r\nIn his appellate brief, Conley points for the first time\r\nto two specific portions of his grand jury transcript that he\r\nclaims should have been admitted into evidence under Rule 106. \r\nThe first excerpt contains Conley's testimony that he was\r\ninterviewed twice by Internal Affairs (\"IA\") about the Cox\r\nincident.  Conley argues that this portion should have been\r\nadmitted into evidence under Rule 106 in order to place in proper\r\ncontext the portions submitted by the government in which Conley\r\ntestified that he never identified himself to homicide detectives\r\nor the district attorney as the arresting officer on the scene on\r\nthe night of the Cox incident.  The government submitted this\r\nevidence to suggest that Conley did not want to be identified as a\r\nwitness to the Cox incident.  The problem with Conley's Rule 106\r\nargument is two-fold.  First, it is clear from the opening\r\nstatements that Conley was aware that the government intended to\r\nintroduce this evidence and to advance this theory of guilt. \r\nThus, we find no reason to make an exception to our general rule of\r\nwaiver.  Second, even if we did allow Conley to make this argument\r\nfor the first time on appeal, we are not convinced that the\r\ndistrict court's exclusion of this part of the transcript was\r\nerror.  We fail to see how testimony to the effect that Conley was\r\ninterviewed by Internal Affairs, and wrote a report of the incident\r\npursuant to an order by the IA investigators, adds to the\r\nevidentiary value of the admitted excerpts.  In our view, a more\r\nrelevant portion of the transcript from a Rule 106 perspective was\r\nConley's explanation as to why he did not notify the homicide\r\ninvestigators or the district attorney's office of the arrest, and\r\nthis portion appropriately was introduced into evidence.\r\nThe second portion of his grand jury testimony that\r\nConley claims should have been admitted is testimony concerning\r\nConley's relationship with Officers Burgio and Williams.  At trial,\r\nthe government presented excerpts of Conley's grand jury testimony\r\nin order to suggest that Conley lied about his involvement in the\r\nCox incident because he wanted to protect his friends, Officers\r\nBurgio and Williams.  The government's submitted excerpts, however,\r\nincluded Conley's testimony to the effect that Officer Burgio was\r\nnot a friend of Conley's, (See Tr. Vol. II at 246), and that\r\nalthough Conley became acquainted with Officer Williams at the\r\npolice academy, he did not socialize or \"go out for drinks\" with\r\nhim.  (Tr. Vol. III at 10).  The inclusion of additional testimony\r\nbearing on this issue was not necessary to place the government's\r\nexcerpts in proper context under Fed. R. Evid. 106.\r\nIn making determinations as to the completeness of\r\nproffered statements, the district court's judgment is entitled to\r\ngreat respect.  See United States v. Houlihan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196936\"><a href=\"/opinion/196936/united-states-v-houlihan/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1271</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1283\r\n(1st Cir. 1996).  We conclude that the district court acted well\r\nwithin its discretion in denying Conley's request that the entire\r\ntranscript of his grand jury testimony be admitted into evidence.\r\n4.  The Jury's Request for a Ruler\r\nDuring jury deliberations, the district judge received a\r\nnote from the jury requesting a ruler.  Over Conley's objection,\r\nthe district judge granted the jury's request, and instructed the\r\njury that the ruler was only to be used on exhibits which contained\r\nan approximate scale for measurement.  Conley contends that the\r\ndistrict judge's decision to provide the jury with a ruler violated\r\nhis right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment to the United\r\nStates Constitution, and requires reversal of his conviction.\r\nAt the outset we note our disagreement with the\r\ngovernment's characterization of a ruler as merely another generic\r\ntool to aid a jury in examining exhibits.  A diagram based on an\r\napproximate scale contains, by definition, imprecise distances and\r\ndimensions.  Therefore, pursuant to the district judge's\r\ninstructions, the jury was using the ruler to obtain more precise\r\ninformation from an exhibit that was imprecise.  The use of a ruler\r\nunder these circumstances is inherently different from the jury's\r\nuse of a magnifying glass to more clearly observe photographs or\r\nfingerprints admitted into evidence.  See, e.g., United States  v.\r\nGeorge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697351\"><a href=\"/opinion/697351/united-states-v-johnaton-sampson-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1078</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1084 (9th Cir. 1995) (jury used magnifying\r\nglass to examine fingerprint cards and gun); United States v.\r\nYoung, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"484998\"><a href=\"/opinion/484998/united-states-v-mack-arthur-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 396 (7th Cir. 1987) (jury used magnifying\r\nglass to examine photographs).\r\nThe weakness in Conley's argument, however, is that it\r\nfails to address the root of the problem: the original admission of\r\nthe exhibit containing the approximate scale.  At trial, Conley\r\nnever objected to the admission of Exhibits 7 or 7A, nor does he\r\nmake such objection on appeal.  If, as Conley suggests, the\r\ndistances and special dimensions of the area at Woodruff Way were\r\ncritical to the government's charge that Conley must have seen Cox\r\nas Conley pursued Brown, Conley should have made a contemporaneous\r\nobjection to the admission of such an imprecise depiction of the\r\ncrime scene.\r\nA district judge's decision to provide a jury with\r\nrequested material to aid in its examination of the evidence is\r\nreviewed for abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Rengifo,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469367\"><a href=\"/opinion/469367/united-states-v-felix-rengifo/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 983 (1st Cir. 1986).  Under the circumstances of this\r\ncase, we cannot conclude that the district judge abused his\r\ndiscretion in granting the jury's request for a ruler.  As the\r\ndistrict judge reasoned, once the diagram was admitted into\r\nevidence, the jury's request for a ruler was both forseeable and\r\nreasonable.  Moreover, even if the request had been denied, there\r\nwas nothing to prevent the jury from simply making its own, perhaps\r\neven more inaccurate, ruler.  Therefore, we conclude that the\r\ndistrict judge acted within his discretion when he granted the\r\njury's request.\r\n5.  Sentencing Issues\r\nConley's main claim of sentencing error is that the\r\ndistrict court erred in calculating his base offense level by\r\ncross-referencing to the sentencing guideline applicable to the\r\nunderlying offense of aggravated assault.  We review the district\r\ncourt's factual determinations under the sentencing guidelines for\r\nclear error.  See United States v. Nez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198028\"><a href=\"/opinion/198028/united-states-v-nunez/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).  However, we review the district court's construction of a\r\nsentencing guideline and its application of the guideline to the\r\nfacts de novo.  See id.\r\nThe Sentencing Guidelines generally provide a base\r\noffense level of twelve for perjury and obstruction of justice. \r\nSee U.S.S.G  2J1.2(a) &amp; 2J1.3(a).  However, if the defendant\r\ncommitted perjury \"in respect to a criminal offense,\" or obstructed\r\n\"the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense,\" the\r\nGuidelines direct the district court to use a cross-reference and\r\nsentence the defendant as an accessory after the fact \"in respect\r\nto that criminal offense.\"  U.S.S.G.  2J1.2(c)(1) &amp; 2J1.3(c)(1). \r\nPursuant to these provisions, the district court cross-referenced\r\nto  2X3.1, the guideline applicable to those convicted of being\r\naccessories after the fact.  Section 2X3.1(a) provides a base\r\noffense level \"6 levels lower than the offense level for the\r\nunderlying offense.\"  U.S.S.G.  2X3.1(a).  The district court\r\nconcluded that the \"underlying offense\" was the violation of\r\nconstitutional rights by the intentional use of excessive force by\r\npolice officers, in violation of 18 U.S.C.  241 &amp; 242, and\r\nreferred to the applicable sentencing guideline found at  2H1.1. \r\nOn appeal, Conley does not challenge this initial cross-reference\r\nfrom  2X3.1(a), to the civil rights guideline found at  2H1.1. \r\nRather, Conley challenges the district court's subsequent cross-\r\nreference from  2H1.1(a)(1) to the sentencing guideline applicable\r\nto the underlying offense of aggravated assault, found at  2A2.2.\r\nThe crux of Conley's argument is that his acquittal on\r\nCount Two of the indictment, which charged Conley with lying about\r\nseeing Cox being beaten by Boston police officers, means that the \r\nunderlying offense for which he is sentenced as an accessory after\r\nthe fact cannot include the intentional use of excessive force. \r\nConley argues that because he was only convicted of lying about\r\nseeing Cox chase the suspect to the fence and grab at him as he\r\nscaled the fence, the offense for which he is sentenced as an\r\naccessory after the fact should only include the other\r\nconstitutional deprivations alleged in the indictment: namely, the\r\nfailure to prevent the assault, and the failure to provide medical\r\ncare.  Because these offenses are not referenced by the guidelines\r\nor by statute as separate underlying offenses, but rather are\r\nsubcategories of the civil rights offense, Conley contends that\r\n2H1.1(a)(3) -- and not  2H1.1(a)(1) -- should apply.  We\r\ndisagree.\r\nConley's acquittal on Count Two has no bearing on what\r\noffenses were under investigation when he testified before the\r\ngrand jury.  As the background section to the obstruction of\r\njustice guideline indicates, the cross-reference to  2X3.1 (the\r\naccessory after the fact guideline) is intended to provide an\r\nenhanced offense level for the crime of obstruction of justice when\r\nthe obstruction is in respect to a particularly serious offense. \r\nSee Commentary to U.S.S.G.  2J1.2(c)(1).  Consistent with this\r\npurpose, the application of the cross-reference does not depend on\r\nthe defendant's actual conviction as an accessory after the fact to\r\nthe offense under investigation.  See United States v. Martnez,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"11350\"><a href=\"/opinion/11350/united-states-v-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 621-22 (5th Cir. 1997);  United States v.

Indeed, application of this cross-\r\nreference does not even depend on the defendant's specific\r\nknowledge of the underlying offense:\r\n  [A defendant's] lack of knowledge of the\r\nspecific offenses under investigation is\r\nirrelevant.  Neither  2J1.2(c)(1) nor  2X3.1\r\nrequires such knowledge as a prerequisite to\r\napplication of the offense level for the\r\n'underlying offense.'  All that is required is\r\nthat the 'offense involved obstructing the\r\ninvestigation or prosecution of a criminal\r\noffense . . . .'   2J1.2(c)(1). [The\r\ndefendant] knew there was a federal grand jury\r\ninvestigation into criminal offenses and that\r\nhe knowingly and willfully attempted to\r\nobstruct it as the jury so found.  This is\r\nenough to trigger the cross-referencing\r\nprovisions of the guidelines.\r\n\nUnited States v. McQueen, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 184 (1st Cir. 1996).  Conley\r\nknew even more than the defendant in McQueen.  Conley knew that the\r\ngrand jury was investigating the assault on Michael Cox by Boston\r\npolice officers, and the trial jury found that he knowingly and\r\nwillfully obstructed that investigation.  The fact that Conley was\r\nacquitted on Count Two is irrelevant for cross-referencing\r\npurposes.\r\nConley further argues that the use of aggravated assault\r\nas the \"underlying offense\" under  2H1.1(a)(1) is barred by the\r\nplain language of the Commentary to this guideline.  The Commentary\r\nto  2H1.1(a)(1) states: \"'Offense guideline applicable to any\r\nunderlying offense' means the offense guideline applicable to any\r\nconduct established by the offense of conviction that constitutes\r\nan offense under federal, state, or local law.\"  Conley contends\r\nthat his offenses of conviction are perjury and obstruction of\r\njustice, and that the only conduct established by these convictions\r\nis that he lied before the grand jury about observing Cox chase the\r\nsuspect as he ran towards the fence.  As discussed supra, the\r\npurpose of the cross-reference in both the perjury and obstruction\r\nof justice guidelines is to measure the gravity of those offenses. \r\nWe conclude that  2H1.1(a)(1) is similarly employed, and that the\r\nsentencing court need not look exclusively to the offense of\r\nconviction.  This conclusion makes logical sense.  As other courts\r\nhave observed, if the \"underlying offense\" was required to be the\r\noffense of conviction, perjurers and obstructors of justice would\r\nbenefit from perjury or obstruction that successfully persuaded a\r\ngrand jury not to return an indictment.  See United States v.\r\nDickerson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741077\"><a href=\"/opinion/741077/united-states-v-christopher-dickerson-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 468 (4th Cir. 1997); McQueen, 86 F.3d at\r\n183.  The Commentary on which Conley relies relates to the\r\nsubstantive offenses involving individual rights.  These notes are\r\nnot relevant under the circumstances presented here because  2H1.1\r\n(a)(1) is being used simply as a formula for the perjury and\r\nobstruction of justice offenses.\r\nFinally, Conley's argument ignores the specific finding\r\nof the district judge that Conley\r\n  observed through his senses of sight and\r\nhearing enough to believe that Cox was being\r\nstruck by other police officers and that his\r\nanswering in a misleading and incomplete way\r\nthe questions that were asked before the grand\r\njury was obstructing the grand jury's\r\ninvestigation to determine whether criminal\r\nconduct of Boston Police Officers on the scene\r\nhad occurred.\r\n\n(Tr. of Disposition Hr'g at 6). We review such factual findings\r\nonly for clear error.  See Nez, 146 F.3d at 40.  Based on the\r\nevidence presented at trial, see supra, this finding does not\r\nconstitute clear error.  Moreover, this finding further supports\r\nthe district court's cross-reference to the underlying offense of\r\naggravated assault.\r\nWe next address Conley's objections to the district\r\ncourt's application of specific offense characteristics under the\r\naggravated assault guideline.  In opposing these enhancements,\r\nConley repeats the argument that his acquittal on Count Two bars\r\nthe court from enhancing his offense level based on the specific\r\ncharacteristics identified in the aggravated assault guideline. \r\nFor the same reasons that we uphold the district court's cross-\r\nreference to the underlying offense of aggravated assault, we\r\nuphold the district court's application of the specific offense\r\ncharacteristics provided for under the same guideline.\r\nConley raises the same argument with respect to the\r\ndistrict court's application of a six level enhancement based on\r\nthe specific offense characteristic provided for under  2H1.1(b),\r\nnamely, that the underlying offense was committed under color of\r\nlaw.  Again, for the same reasons that we uphold the district\r\ncourt's initial cross-reference to  2H1.1(a), we uphold its\r\napplication of the six level enhancement pursuant to  2H1.1(b).\r\nFinally, Conley argues that the district court erred in\r\ndenying his request for a four level reduction based on his role as\r\na minimal participant in the underlying offenses.  See U.S.S.G.\r\n3B1.2(a).  In support of his request for such a reduction, Conley\r\nargued that the relevant criminal activity was the aggravated\r\nassault on Officer Cox.  The district court concluded, however,\r\nthat the relevant criminal activity for purposes of  3B1.2 was\r\nConley's perjury and obstruction of justice.  We agree with the\r\ndistrict court.  We reiterate that the district court's\r\ncharacterization of the underlying offense as a civil rights\r\nviolation, and, more specifically, as aggravated assault, was for\r\nthe limited purpose of measuring the gravity of Conley's perjury\r\nand obstruction of justice offenses.  For all other purposes,\r\nConley's offenses of conviction remain perjury and obstruction of\r\njustice.  Clearly, the district court did not err in concluding\r\nthat Conley was not a \"minimal participant\" in these criminal\r\nactivities.\r\n                          CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the defendant's conviction is\r\naffirmed.\n</pre>",
