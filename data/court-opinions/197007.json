Claimant-appellant Megan Barker challenges\r                            \r\n\nthe denial  of disability benefits under  the Social Security\r\n\nDisability   Insurance   and  Supplemental   Security  Income\r\n\nprograms.  We affirm.\r\n\n     In 1982, claimant  tripped on a concrete  stair and fell\r\n\non her left knee while running with her company in the United\r\n\nStates Army.  She suffered a contusion or laceration, and she\r\n\nwas removed from  regular duty  for a short  period of  time.\r\n\nBarker  finished her  term  in the  military  and received  a\r\n\nregular discharge in 1984.  Thereafter, she worked at various\r\n\njobs (mainly cashiering) until August 1992.\r\n\n     In 1993, claimant applied for disability benefits due to\r\n\npatellofemoral pain syndrome.  She complained of swelling and\r\n\npain in  her left knee, especially  if she walks or  stands a\r\n\nlot.   She also complained that  her knee occasionally \"locks\r\n\nup\" or \"gives out.\"   She stated that she has had pain in her\r\n\nknee since her injury  in 1982, but that the pain  has gotten\r\n\nworse.  She described  the pain as constant and  claimed that\r\n\nit is unrelieved by medication (Ibuprofen or Motrin).  \r\n\n     The Administrative  Law Judge (ALJ) found  that claimant\r\n\nhas  patellofemoral  pain  syndrome,  but that  it  does  not\r\n\nsignificantly limit her ability to perform basic work-related\r\n\nfunctions.   Having  concluded that  Barker does  not have  a\r\n\nsevere impairment,  the ALJ terminated the  review process at\r\n\nStep 2, or  the severity stage,  of the five-step  sequential\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ninquiry.  See Bowen v. Yuckert, 482 U.S. 137 (1987); McDonald\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Secretary of  Health &amp;  Human Servs., 795  F.2d 1118  (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1986).    The decision  of  the  ALJ  became the  final\r\n\ndecision  of the  Secretary when  the Appeals  Council denied\r\n\nreview.    Claimant appealed  to  the  district court,  which\r\n\nreferred  the matter  to  a magistrate  judge for  report and\r\n\nrecommendation.  The  magistrate recommended affirmance,  and\r\n\nthe  district judge adopted  the magistrate's recommendation.\r\n\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\n     The medical  records submitted by the  claimant are from\r\n\nthe Veterans Administration (VA).   These records reveal that\r\n\nclaimant's  left knee was examined  on two occasions  by a VA\r\n\nphysician  for  the purpose  of  determining  whether she  is\r\n\neligible for a  VA disability  rating.  In  addition, the  VA\r\n\nDisability  Council  sent  claimant   to  see  Dr.  Pepe,  an\r\n\northopedic  consultant.   Dr. Pepe  examined claimant  on one\r\n\noccasion,   December  9,   1992.     Although   he  diagnosed\r\n\npatellofemoral pain  syndrome, Dr. Pepe's  objective findings\r\n\nare  almost entirely  negative.   On March  11, 1993,  the VA\r\n\nassigned claimant  a 30%  disability rating.   At that  time,\r\n\nobjective  findings  were said  to  show  a small  amount  of\r\n\neffusion in the left knee, as well as some warmth and diffuse\r\n\ntenderness  in  the knee.    On  October 19,  1993,  claimant\r\n\narrived at Dr. Pepe's office without an appointment and spoke\r\n\nto him briefly  in the hallway.  Following this conversation,\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nDr.  Pepe wrote  a  short note  in  which he  stated:   \"[The\r\n\nclaimant]  says  she has  pain  in  her  legs that  precludes\r\n\nsitting or standing at  work.  Would recommend no  sitting or\r\n\nstanding in order to help the pain.\"\r\n\n     As  an initial  matter, we  are persuaded  that the  ALJ\r\n\ncould properly reject Dr.  Pepe's October 19, 1993 assessment\r\n\nessentially  for the reasons stated  by the magistrate in his\r\n\nrecommended  decision.1   We  add that  there is  conflicting\r                                  1\r\n\nmedical  evidence  in  the  record.    None  of  the  medical\r\n\nconsultants found any limitation in claimant's ability to sit\r\n\nor stand.2    Moreover, Dr.  Pepe's  note is  conclusory  and\r                     2\r\n\ndevoid  of objective  medical  findings.   See  20 C.F.R.    \r                                                          \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1The magistrate stated:\r               1\r\n\n          Given that Dr. Pepe had last examined the\r\n          plaintiff   nearly   ten  months   before\r\n          writing the October [19], 1993 note, that\r\n          he  had  no advance  notice of  her visit\r\n          (and  thus no  opportunity to  review her\r\n          file), and that he  wrote the note at the\r\n          plaintiff's request and without examining\r\n          her  anew,  the Administrative  Law Judge\r\n          was entitled to disregard it . . . \r\n\nReport and Recommended Decision at 5-6.\r\n\n   2Dr. Johnson,  a  State agency  consultant,  reviewed  the\r               2\r\nmedical evidence and concluded that claimant does not have an\r\nimpairment which  limits her  ability to perform  basic work-\r\nrelated  functions.    Dr.  Goffin,  a  second  State  agency\r\nconsultant,   completed   a   Residual  Functional   Capacity\r\nAssessment  which  indicates   no  limitation  in  claimant's\r\nability to sit  or stand.   Dr. Babcock,  a medical  advisor,\r\ntestified at the administrative hearing that he had \"a lot of\r\ntrouble  placing much  credibility in  [Dr. Pepe's]  note\" in\r\nlight  of the  fact that  Dr. Pepe  did not  examine claimant\r\nbefore writing it.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\n404.1527(d)  (explaining how  the  Secretary  weighs  medical\r\n\nopinions),  416.927(d)  (same);  Matney  ex  rel.  Matney  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nSullivan,  981 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir. 1992) (\"The ALJ need\r                    \r\n\nnot  accept  an  opinion  of  a  physician--even  a  treating\r\n\nphysician--if it  is conclusory and brief  and is unsupported\r\n\nby clinical findings.\").\r\n\n     We  also  think  the   ALJ  could  properly  reject  the\r\n\ncredibility of claimant's statements concerning  the limiting\r\n\neffects of her pain and other symptoms.  See Irlando Ortiz v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nSecretary  of Health &amp; Human  Servs., 955 F.2d  765, 769 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1991)   (per  curiam)   (explaining  that  it   is  the\r\n\nresponsibility  of  the  Secretary  to  determine  issues  of\r\n\ncredibility).   The VA treatment record is  quite sparse, and\r\n\nmost  of   the  objective  medical  findings   are  negative.\r\n\nClaimant's allegations that her pain significantly limits her\r\n\nability  to sit or stand is inconsistent with the opinions of\r\n\nthe medical consultants.  In addition, the ALJ properly could\r\n\nfind  that claimant's  allegations are inconsistent  with her\r\n\nreported activities.3  See  20 C.F.R.    404.1529 (explaining\r                                3     \r\n\nhow the Secretary evaluates pain), 416.929 (same). \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   3Claimant  is  able to  do  housework (including  dusting,\r               3\r\nvacuuming, laundry, and washing dishes) and, according to one\r\nof her reports, she is able to do grocery shopping.  She also\r\ndrives  her  car, visits  friends, and  has taken  a computer\r\ntraining course.   Each of these  activities involves sitting\r\nor standing.   \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n     For  the foregoing  reasons, we  are persuaded  that the\r\n\nSecretary's  severity  finding  is  supported  by substantial\r\n\nevidence.  Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.\r                                                                  \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982, claimant tripped on a concrete stair and fell on her left knee while running with her company in the United States Army.  She suffered a contusion or laceration, and she was removed from regular duty for a short period of time.  Barker finished her term in the military and received a regular discharge in 1984.  Thereafter, she worked at various jobs (mainly cashiering) until August 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, claimant applied for disability benefits due to patellofemoral pain syndrome.  She complained of swelling and pain in her left knee, especially if she walks or stands a lot.  She also complained that her knee occasionally \"locks up\" or \"gives out.\"   She stated that she has had pain in her knee since her injury in 1982, but that the pain has gotten worse.  She described the pain as constant and claimed that it is unrelieved by medication (Ibuprofen or Motrin).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that claimant has patellofemoral pain syndrome, but that it does not significantly limit her ability to perform basic work-related functions.  Having concluded that Barker does not have a severe impairment, the ALJ terminated the review process at Step 2, or the severity stage, of the five-step sequential inquiry.   See Bowen v. Yuckert, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111907\"><a href=\"/opinion/111907/bowen-v-yuckert/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span> (1987);   McDonald v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"473625\"><a href=\"/opinion/473625/claire-mcdonald-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1118</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1986).  The decision of the ALJ became the final decision of the Secretary when the Appeals Council denied review.  Claimant appealed to the district court, which referred the matter to a magistrate judge for report and recommendation.  The magistrate recommended affirmance, and the district judge adopted the magistrate's recommendation.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The medical records submitted by the claimant are from the Veterans Administration (VA).  These records reveal that claimant's left knee was examined on two occasions by a VA physician for the purpose of determining whether she is eligible for a VA disability rating.  In addition, the VA Disability Council sent claimant to see Dr. Pepe, an orthopedic consultant.  Dr. Pepe examined claimant on one occasion, December 9, 1992.  Although he diagnosed patellofemoral pain syndrome, Dr. Pepe's objective findings are almost entirely negative.  On March 11, 1993, the VA assigned claimant a 30% disability rating.  At that time, objective findings were said to show a small amount of effusion in the left knee, as well as some warmth and diffuse tenderness in the knee.  On October 19, 1993, claimant arrived at Dr. Pepe's office without an appointment and spoke to him briefly in the hallway.  Following this conversation, Dr. Pepe wrote a short note in which he stated:  \"[The claimant] says she has pain in her legs that precludes sitting or standing at work.  Would recommend no sitting or standing in order to help the pain.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we are persuaded that the ALJ could properly reject Dr. Pepe's October 19, 1993 assessment essentially for the reasons stated by the magistrate in his recommended decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We add that there is conflicting medical evidence in the record.  None of the medical consultants found any limitation in claimant's ability to sit or stand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Moreover, Dr. Pepe's note is conclusory and devoid of objective medical findings.  See 20 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 404.1527(d) (explaining how the Secretary weighs medical opinions), 416.927(d) (same);   Matney ex rel.  Matney v. Sullivan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596560\"><a href=\"/opinion/596560/39-socsecrepser-588-unemplinsrep-cch-p-17128a-tambra-l-matney/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span>, 1019 (9th Cir.1992) (\"The ALJ need not accept an opinion of a physician--even a treating physician--if it is conclusory and brief and is unsupported by clinical findings.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also think the ALJ could properly reject the credibility of claimant's statements concerning the limiting effects of her pain and other symptoms.   See Irlando Ortiz v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577108\"><a href=\"/opinion/577108/victor-j-irlanda-ortiz-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 769 (1st Cir.1991) (per curiam) (explaining that it is the responsibility of the Secretary to determine issues of credibility).  The VA treatment record is quite sparse, and most of the objective medical findings are negative.  Claimant's allegations that her pain significantly limits her ability to sit or stand is inconsistent with the opinions of the medical consultants.  In addition, the ALJ properly could find that claimant's allegations are inconsistent with her reported activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See 20 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 404.1529 (explaining how the Secretary evaluates pain), 416.929 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we are persuaded that the Secretary's severity finding is supported by substantial evidence.  Accordingly, the judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The magistrate stated:</p>\n        <p>Given that Dr. Pepe had last examined the plaintiff nearly ten months before writing the October , 1993 note, that he had no advance notice of her visit (and thus no opportunity to review her file), and that he wrote the note at the plaintiff's request and without examining her anew, the Administrative Law Judge was entitled to disregard it ...</p>\n        <p>Report and Recommended Decision at 5-6.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Dr. Johnson, a State agency consultant, reviewed the medical evidence and concluded that claimant does not have an impairment which limits her ability to perform basic work-related functions.  Dr. Goffin, a second State agency consultant, completed a Residual Functional Capacity Assessment which indicates no limitation in claimant's ability to sit or stand.  Dr. Babcock, a medical advisor, testified at the administrative hearing that he had \"a lot of trouble placing much credibility in [Dr. Pepe's] note\" in light of the fact that Dr. Pepe did not examine claimant before writing it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Claimant is able to do housework (including dusting, vacuuming, laundry, and washing dishes) and, according to one of her reports, she is able to do grocery shopping.  She also drives her car, visits friends, and has taken a computer training course.  Each of these activities involves sitting or standing</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
