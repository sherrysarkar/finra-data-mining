Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nM.

Alejandro Savinon appeals from his conviction\r\nand sentence for conspiring to possess with intent to\r\ndistribute and to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. \r\nAppellate counsel has filed a brief pursuant to Anders v.\r\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), and a motion to withdraw. \r\nCounsel has notified Savinon of his right to file a\r\nsupplemental brief, but Savinon has not done so.  After\r\nthoroughly examining the entire record, we agree that there is\r\nno meritorious ground for appeal.\r\n    Savinon pled guilty at a plea hearing which conformed\r\nsubstantially to Fed. R. Crim. P. 11 requirements.  The\r\npresentence report (\"PSR\") provides factual support for the\r\ndistrict court's calculation of the applicable guideline\r\nimprisonment range.  Moreover, Savinon's own version of the\r\nfacts -- which was filed with the sentencing court -- accepts\r\nthe PSR's quantities of cocaine powder and cocaine base as\r\naccurate.  In recognition of Savinon's admission to those\r\nfacts, the government moved for -- and the court granted -- a\r\nthree-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under\r\nsection 3E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, and\r\na downward departure from the applicable guideline imprisonment\r\nrange under  5K1.1.  The court's failure to depart further\r\ndoes not provide a meritorious ground for appeal.  See United\r\nStates v. McAndrews, 12 F.3d 273, 277 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n    Savinon's conviction and sentence are summarily affirmed.\r\nSee Loc. R. 27.1.  Appellate counsel's motion to withdraw is\r\ngranted.\r\n",
