She  named as  defendants the  director of  the Rhode\r\n\nIsland  Department of  Employment and  Training  (\"DET\") and  the\r\n\nSecretary of the federal Department of Labor.  The Salvation Army\r\n\nintervened as  a defendant.   The district court rejected  all of\r\n\nRojas's substantive  arguments for declaratory  relief, see Rojas\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

We affirm.\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r\n\n          The following facts are not disputed.  Rojas was a paid\r\n\nemployee of the  Salvation Army, serving as a  social case worker\r\n\nfrom  1988 to 1994, except  for a short  interruption in 1990 and\r\n\n1991 when  she worked  for Catholic Social  Services.   Rojas was\r\n\nnot, and  was not  required to  be, a  soldier or  member of  the\r\n\nSalvation Army  when employed  as a case  worker.   The Salvation\r\n\nArmy   terminated  her  employment  on  March  18,  1994,  citing\r\n\nfinancial constraints.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          Approximately  one month  after her  termination, Rojas\r\n\napplied for  unemployment insurance benefits  from the DET.   The\r\n\nDET found that  Rojas was ineligible because her former employer,\r\n\nthe  Salvation  Army,  was  exempt  from  contributing  to  Rhode\r\n\nIsland's unemployment insurance scheme under sections  28-42-8(4)\r\n\nand 28-44-11 of the Rhode Island General Laws.1  Pursuant to  the\r\n\nexemption  for religious  employers under section  28-42-8(4), no\r\n\ntaxes were withheld from Rojas's wages by the Salvation Army, and\r\n\nher income was  not reported  to the  DET.  The  DET's denial  of\r\n\nbenefits was upheld  by a DET referee after a  hearing, and later\r\n\nthe referee's  determination  was  upheld  by the  DET  Board  of\r\n\nReview.\r\n\n          On  September 9,  1994, Rojas  initiated  an action  in\r\n\nfederal district court against  the Director of the DET,  seeking\r\n\ndeclaratory  invalidation  of  the  exemption  under  either  the\r\n\nEstablishment Clause,2  the Equal Protection Clause,3  or Article\r\n\nI,     3 of  the  Rhode  Island  Constitution.4   In  an  amended\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   In 1987,  the DET  determined that  the Salvation  Army is  a\r\n\"church\" and thus entitled to  an exemption pursuant to R.I. Gen.\r\nLaws   28-42-8(4).\r\n\n2  U.S. Const. amend. I  (\"Congress shall make no law  respecting\r\nan  establishment of religion,  or prohibiting the  free exercise\r\nthereof . . . .\").\r\n\n3  U.S. Const. amends. V, XIV.\r\n\n4   Article I,   3 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\n          .  .  .  no  person  shall  be  compelled  to\r\n          frequent or to support any religious worship,\r\n          place,  or   ministry  whatever,   except  in\r\n          fulfillment   of   such   person's  voluntary\r\n          contract; nor enforced, restrained, molested,\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncomplaint, Rojas added  the Secretary of the  Department of Labor\r\n\nas  a defendant,  on the  theory that  FUTA's allowance  of state\r\n\nexemptions   for   religious  employers   in   the  federal-state\r\n\nunemployment  insurance system  was an  underlying  cause of  the\r\n\nRhode  Island exemption  she challenged.   See 26  U.S.C. 3309(b)\r                                                        \r\n\n(FUTA   provision   listing  permissible   employer   exemptions,\r\n\nincluding exemption for religious employers).  The Salvation Army\r\n\nwas allowed to intervene, without objection, as a defendant.\r\n\n          FUTA establishes  a federal-state  unemployment benefit\r\n\nscheme requiring  employers to pay  a federal excise tax,  see 26\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.    3301 (computing the  tax as  a percentage  of wages  of\r\n\ncovered employees),  but  encouraging the  development  of  state\r\n\nunemployment  insurance programs  in  the following  ways: first,\r\n\nemployers  paying into a  qualifying state unemployment  fund are\r\n\nentitled to a  credit on the federal  tax, see 26 U.S.C.    3302,\r                                                        \r\n\nand second,  a qualifying  state is entitled  to receive  federal\r\n\ngrants  toward the cost of administering the state's unemployment\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          or   burdened   in   body   or   goods;   nor\r\n          disqualified  from  holding any  office;  nor\r\n          otherwise suffer on  account of such person's\r\n          religious belief; and that every person shall\r\n          be  free  to  worship  God according  to  the\r\n          dictates of such person's  conscience, and to\r\n          profess  and  by  argument  to maintain  such\r\n          person's opinion in matters of religion;  and\r\n          that  the same  shall  in no  wise  diminish,\r\n          enlarge, or affect the  civil capacity of any\r\n          person.\r\n\nR.I. Const. art. I,   3.  Rojas also appealed the decision of the\r\nDET board in  state court, a suit  which has been  stayed pending\r\nresolution of her federal civil action. \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ncompensation  program,  see 42  U.S.C.     503.   Rhode  Island's\r                                     \r\n\nunemployment fund qualified for participation in the FUTA system.\r\n\n          FUTA  exempts   certain  classes   of  employees   from\r\n\nmandatory  state coverage  by a  qualifying state  plan.   See 26\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.    3309(b).    The current  scope  of  exemptions reflects\r\n\namendments made to FUTA by Congress in 1976.  The 1976 Amendments\r\n\nnarrowed  the set  of employees  who  were exempt  from mandatory\r\n\nstate  coverage,  by  requiring,  for  example,  that  previously\r\n\nexempted school employees be covered.  In 1970 as well, the scope\r\n\nof FUTA exemptions was narrowed significantly by Congress when it\r\n\nrepealed  a broad exemption previously available to all nonprofit\r\n\norganizations.    See  generally  California  v.  Grace  Brethren\r                                                                           \r\n\nChurch, 457  U.S. 393, 397  (1982) (describing the 1970  and 1976\r                \r\n\nFUTA Amendments).  \r\n\n          Currently, the  segments of  the labor  force that  the\r\n\nstates are  not  required to  cover  under FUTA  section  3309(b)\r\n\ninclude persons \"in  the employ of (A) a  church or convention or\r\n\nassociation of churches, or (B) an organization which is operated\r\n\nprimarily   for  religious  purposes   and  which   is  operated,\r\n\nsupervised, controlled, or  principally supported by a  church or\r\n\nconvention or association  of churches.\"  26 U.S.C.   3309(b)(1).\r\n\nAlso  exempt  are  employees  of  small  nonprofit  organizations\r\n\n(having  fewer than  four  regular  employees),  see     3309(c),\r                                                              \r\n\nelected  state employees, see    3309(b)(3), employees at certain\r                                       \r\n\nrehabilitation  facilities,  see     3309(4)(A), and  inmates  of\r                                          \r\n\ncustodial or penal institutions, see   3309(b)(6).\r                                              \r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\n          The  Rhode Island  Employment  Security Act  (\"RIESA\"),\r\n\nR.I.G.L.     28-42-1  et  seq.,  exempts a  variety  of kinds  of\r                                        \r\n\nemployment from coverage.   See R.I. Gen. Laws    28-42-8 (1995).\r                                         \r\n\nApparently tracking the  language of FUTA, Section  28-42-8(4)(i)\r\n\nexempts  service performed  \"in the  employ of:  (A) A  church or\r\n\nconvention or  association of  churches, or  (B) an  organization\r\n\nwhich  is   operated,  supervised,  controlled,   or  principally\r\n\nsupported by a church or  convention or association of churches.\"\r\n\nOther exempted  employees under  RIESA include  certain insurance\r\n\nbrokers, golf  caddies, certain rehabilitation  center employees,\r\n\nand  certain real estate brokers. R.I.  Gen. Laws    28-42-8(11),\r\n\n(9), (4)(B)(iii), (10).\r\n\n          The  defendants raised  a  number of  procedural claims\r\n\nbelow, all of  which were rejected  by the district court.   Upon\r\n\nreaching the merits of Rojas's suit,  the district court rejected\r\n\nall of her claims.  On appeal, Rojas argues that the Rhode Island\r\n\nand  FUTA  exemptions  for religions  violate  the  Establishment\r\n\nClause  and   the  Equal   Protection  Clause   of  the   federal\r\n\nConstitution, while  the  appellees reassert  their  claims  that\r\n\njurisdiction is  lacking because of  the Tax  Injunction Act,  28\r\n\nU.S.C.   1341 and that the appellant lacks standing.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          Because we find that the appellant's claims fail on the\r\n\nmerits, we  need not reach  either the  claim put forward  by the\r\n\nfederal defendant-appellee that Rojas lacks standing to challenge\r\n\nFUTA or  the claim  put forward  by the  state defendant-appellee\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nthat the  Tax Injunction Act  bars federal jurisdiction  over the\r\n\nsuit.

The Establishment Clause Claim\r\n\n          At the  core of  the Establishment  Clause is the  idea\r\n\nthat  government cannot  \"favor  religion over  nonreligion,  nor\r\n\nsponsor a  particular sect, nor try to encourage participation in\r\n\nor abnegation of  religion.\"  Walz v.  Tax Comm'n, 397  U.S. 664,\r                                                           \r\n\n694   (1970)  (Harlan,   J.,  concurring)   (noting  that   while\r\n\ndisagreements  over  applications  of  Establishment  Clause  are\r\n\ncommon,  its  core ideal  is  well  established).   In  order  to\r\n\nvindicate this  constitutional  guarantee, two  tests  have  long\r\n\nguided  judicial review of any challenged legislation: first, the\r\n\nlaw  must  have  a  purpose  other than  to  advance  or  inhibit\r\n\nreligion; second,  the primary effect  of the law must  not be to\r\n\nadvance or inhibit religion.  See, e.g., Abington School District\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Shempp, 347 U.S.  203, 222 (1963) (\"The test may  be stated as\r                   \r\n\nfollows:    what  are  the  purpose and  primary  effect  of  the\r\n\nenactment?

The  district court\r                                  \r\n\napplied the Lemon test in the course of holding that FUTA and the\r                           \r\n\nRIESA did not violate the Establishment Clause.  See 928 F. Supp.\r                                                              \r\n\nat 163-66.

See  117 S. Ct.\r                                                               \r\n\nat  2010-13 (stating  that  the  Court  no longer  considers  the\r\n\npresence  of public school employees on parochial school property\r\n\nto  lead ineluctably to the impermissible  effect of advancing or\r\n\nendorsing  religion where  their  presence  is  part  of  neutral\r\n\nprogram).\r\n\n          The district  court properly  found that  the FUTA  and\r\n\nRIESA exemptions  had neither  an impermissible  purpose, nor  an\r\n\nimpermissible effect on  religion.  First, both the  FUTA and the\r\n\nRIESA  exemption   provisions  serve   the  secular   purpose  of\r\n\nfacilitating the administration of the federal-state unemployment\r\n\ninsurance program by excluding from coverage a variety of workers\r\n\nwhose employment  patterns are irregular  or whose wages  are not\r\n\neasily accountable.  With regard to FUTA, Rojas concedes that the\r\n\noriginal  purpose of  the  coverage  exemptions  was  to  address\r\n\nadministrability  concerns.    She contends,  however,  that  the\r\n\ncurrent 26 U.S.C.   3309, viewed in the wake of the 1970 and 1976\r\n\nAmendments, reflects the purpose of favoring religion rather than\r\n\nthe secular purpose  of providing ease of  administration.  Rojas\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nis unable  to direct  our  attention to,  nor  can we  find,  any\r\n\nindications  in the  legislative  history of  the  1970 and  1976\r\n\nAmendments  that suggest  an impermissible  purpose of  advancing\r\n\nreligion in  general  or any  particular  religion.   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nWallace  v.  Jaffree,  472  U.S.  38,  56  (1985)  (\"[T]he  First\r                              \r\n\nAmendment requires  that a statute  must be invalidated if  it is\r\n\nentirely   motivated  by   a  purpose  to   advance  religion.\").\r\n\nMoreover, the  current exemption  for religious employment,  even\r\n\nafter the amendments, still rests within the context of a variety\r\n\nof  other exemptions,  all  of  which appear  to  share a  common\r\n\nsecular purpose.   Efficient administration  of the  unemployment\r\n\ncompensation  system   is  particularly   enhanced  through   the\r\n\nexemptions  for religion because  it eliminates the  need for the\r\n\ngovernment to  review employment decisions  made on the  basis of\r\n\nreligious rationales.  These considerations are  also true of the\r\n\nexemptions listed in R.I. Gen.  Laws   28-42-8(1).  The exemption\r\n\nfor  religions  contained  therein, when  viewed  in  context, is\r\n\ninnocuous.  It appears to  serve the interest in facilitating the\r\n\nadministration  of   federal  and  state   unemployment  benefits\r\n\nprograms,  and Rojas  can point  to  no other  evidence that  the\r\n\n\"purpose   that  animated  adoption\"  was  to  advance  religion.\r\n\nEdwards v.  Aguillard, 482 U.S.  578, 585 (1987).   In  Walz, the\r                                                                      \r\n\nSupreme  Court  upheld  property  tax  exemptions  for  religious\r\n\ninstitutions, arguing that such exemptions, although not required\r\n\nby  the Free  Exercise Clause,  were  valid governmental  actions\r\n\n\"productive   of  a  benevolent   neutrality  which  will  permit\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nreligious  exercise to  exist  without  sponsorship  and  without\r\n\ninterference.\"     397  U.S.   at  669.     Including   religious\r\n\ninstitutions  within   a  set   of  unemployment   tax  exemption\r\n\nrecipients -- selected on the  basis of reducing difficulties  in\r\n\nadministering an unemployment insurance program --  reflects less\r\n\nof  a desire  to sponsor  religion than  the direct  property tax\r\n\nexemptions upheld in Walz.\r                                   \r\n\n          Rojas's brief  on appeal  places much  weight on  Texas\r                                                                           \r\n\nMonthly v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1 (1989), which struck down a narrow\r                            \r\n\nTexas  sales and  use tax  exemption for  \"'periodicals that  are\r\n\npublished or  distributed by a  religious faith and  that consist\r\n\nwholly of  writings promulgating  the teaching  of the faith  and\r\n\nbooks that  consist  wholly of  writings  sacred to  a  religious\r\n\nfaith.'\"   Id.  at 5  (quoting  Texas statute).   Although  Texas\r                                                                           \r\n\nMonthly stands for the proposition that a subsidy that is granted\r                 \r\n\nonly  to  religious   publications  and  not  to   other  similar\r\n\npublications \"lacks sufficient breadth to pass scrutiny under the\r\n\nEstablishment Clause,\" it also stated that \"[i]nsofar as [a  tax]\r\n\nsubsidy is conferred upon a wide array of non-sectarian groups as\r\n\nwell as  religious organizations  in pursuit  of some  legitimate\r\n\nsecular  end, the fact that religious groups benefit incidentally\r\n\ndoes not deprive  the subsidy of the secular  purpose and primary\r\n\neffect mandated by the Establishment Clause.\"  489 U.S. at 14-15.\r\n\nThe exemption provisions at issue in the instant case fall within\r\n\nthe latter category.  We decline Rojas's invitation to read Texas\r                                                                           \r\n\nMonthly  as requiring that  a provision  incidentally benefitting\r                 \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nreligion must grant a like benefit to every group that could also\r                       \r\n\nconceivably fall within  the secular rationale for  the exemption\r\n\nprovision.        Texas    Monthly    nowhere    requires    this\r                                            \r\n\nunderinclusiveness analysis, but  instead indicates  that when  a\r\n\n\"wide array\" of groups are benefitted by a provision that pursues\r\n\na single, unifying,  secular end, one of these  groups may indeed\r\n\nbe religious  institutions.   In Texas Monthly,  the other  Texas\r                                                        \r\n\nsales tax exemptions did not serve the same purpose as the narrow\r\n\nexemption  for religious  periodicals, and  thus their  existence\r\n\ncould  not rescue  the  challenged exemption.    By contrast,  an\r\n\nadequate array  of groups are  exempted under the FUTA  and RIESA\r\n\nprovisions,  reinforcing  our   conclusion  that  the   religious\r\n\nexemptions  here   serve  the  legitimate   secular  purpose   of\r\n\nfacilitating  the administration  of  the unemployment  insurance\r\n\nsystem.5\r\n\n          The second  basic Establishment Clause concern  is that\r\n\nof  avoiding the effective promotion or advancement of particular\r\n\nreligions or of religion in  general by the government.  Although\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5    We therefore  need not  address the  defendants' alternative\r\nlegal argument  in defense of  the exemptions,  namely that  even\r\nwere the  exemption provided  only to religions,  it would  still\r                                            \r\nserve the legitimate  secular purpose of  decreasing governmental\r\nentanglement with religion.  It is well established that \"it is a\r\npermissible   legislative   purpose  to   alleviate   significant\r\ngovernmental   interference   with  the   ability   of  religious\r\norganizations  to define and carry out their religious missions.\"\r\nCorporation of the Presiding Bishop of the Church of Jesus Christ\r                                                                           \r\nof  the Latter-Day  Saints  v.

But again, we do not need to\r\nconsider whether  the exemptions at  issue here are  supported on\r\nthis accommodation rationale.\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nfavoritism toward any  particular sect is not an  issue raised by\r\n\nthis appeal, it is not  disputed that religious institutions as a\r\n\nwhole  benefit  from the  FUTA  and  RIESA  tax exemptions.    An\r\n\nincidental  benefit to religion does not, however, render invalid\r\n\na  statutory scheme  with a  valid secular  purpose.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nAgostini, 117 S. Ct. at  2014; Zobrest v.

It  is also\r                                           \r\n\nworth  noting that while  religious employers may  be benefitted,\r\n\nthe  employees   of  exempted  religious  institutions,   as  the\r\n\nappellant   has  discovered,  may  be  ineligible  to  enjoy  the\r\n\nattendant  benefits  of  the  unemployment  compensation  scheme.\r\n\nThus, the  primary effect of the  exemptions is not to  force the\r\n\ngeneral  public to  subsidize  religion.    Rather,  the  primary\r\n\npractical  effect of the exemptions for religious institutions is\r\n\nto   exclude  former   employees   of   such  institutions   from\r\n\nparticipating in the Rhode Island unemployment insurance system.\r\n\n          Finally,  as  the  district  court correctly  reasoned,\r\n\nentanglement concerns are in fact reduced through the adoption of\r\n\nthe exemptions in this case.

See 928 F. Supp.\r                                                              \r\n\nat  166.

Rojas was a paid\r\n\nemployee of the  Salvation Army, serving as a  social case worker\r\n\nfrom  1988 to 1994, except  for a short  interruption in 1990 and\r\n\n1991 when  she worked  for Catholic Social  Services.   Rojas was\r\n\nnot, and  was not  required to  be, a  soldier or  member of  the\r\n\nSalvation Army  when employed  as a case  worker.   The Salvation\r\n\nArmy   terminated  her  employment  on  March  18,  1994,  citing\r\n\nfinancial constraints.  \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          Approximately  one month  after her  termination, Rojas\r\n\napplied for  unemployment insurance benefits  from the DET.   The\r\n\nDET found that  Rojas was ineligible because her former employer,\r\n\nthe  Salvation  Army,  was  exempt  from  contributing  to  Rhode\r\n\nIsland's unemployment insurance scheme under sections  28-42-8(4)\r\n\nand 28-44-11 of the Rhode Island General Laws.1  Pursuant to  the\r\n\nexemption  for religious  employers under section  28-42-8(4), no\r\n\ntaxes were withheld from Rojas's wages by the Salvation Army, and\r\n\nher income was  not reported  to the  DET.  The  DET's denial  of\r\n\nbenefits was upheld  by a DET referee after a  hearing, and later\r\n\nthe referee's  determination  was  upheld  by the  DET  Board  of\r\n\nReview.\r\n\n          On  September 9,  1994, Rojas  initiated  an action  in\r\n\nfederal district court against  the Director of the DET,  seeking\r\n\ndeclaratory  invalidation  of  the  exemption  under  either  the\r\n\nEstablishment Clause,2  the Equal Protection Clause,3  or Article\r\n\nI,     3 of  the  Rhode  Island  Constitution.4   In  an  amended\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   In 1987,  the DET  determined that  the Salvation  Army is  a\r\n\"church\" and thus entitled to  an exemption pursuant to R.I. Gen.\r\nLaws   28-42-8(4).\r\n\n2  U.S. Const. amend.

See 26  U.S.C. 3309(b)\r                                                        \r\n\n(FUTA   provision   listing  permissible   employer   exemptions,\r\n\nincluding exemption for religious employers).  The Salvation Army\r\n\nwas allowed to intervene, without objection, as a defendant.\r\n\n          FUTA establishes  a federal-state  unemployment benefit\r\n\nscheme requiring  employers to pay  a federal excise tax,  see 26\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.    3301 (computing the  tax as  a percentage  of wages  of\r\n\ncovered employees),  but  encouraging the  development  of  state\r\n\nunemployment  insurance programs  in  the following  ways: first,\r\n\nemployers  paying into a  qualifying state unemployment  fund are\r\n\nentitled to a  credit on the federal  tax, see 26 U.S.C.    3302,\r                                                        \r\n\nand second,  a qualifying  state is entitled  to receive  federal\r\n\ngrants  toward the cost of administering the state's unemployment\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n          or   burdened   in   body   or   goods;   nor\r\n          disqualified  from  holding any  office;  nor\r\n          otherwise suffer on  account of such person's\r\n          religious belief; and that every person shall\r\n          be  free  to  worship  God according  to  the\r\n          dictates of such person's  conscience, and to\r\n          profess  and  by  argument  to maintain  such\r\n          person's opinion in matters of religion;  and\r\n          that  the same  shall  in no  wise  diminish,\r\n          enlarge, or affect the  civil capacity of any\r\n          person.\r\n\nR.I. Const. art. I,   3.  Rojas also appealed the decision of the\r\nDET board in  state court, a suit  which has been  stayed pending\r\nresolution of her federal civil action. \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ncompensation  program,  see 42  U.S.C.     503.

See 26\r                                                                        \r\n\nU.S.C.    3309(b).    The current  scope  of  exemptions reflects\r\n\namendments made to FUTA by Congress in 1976.  The 1976 Amendments\r\n\nnarrowed  the set  of employees  who  were exempt  from mandatory\r\n\nstate  coverage,  by  requiring,  for  example,  that  previously\r\n\nexempted school employees be covered.  In 1970 as well, the scope\r\n\nof FUTA exemptions was narrowed significantly by Congress when it\r\n\nrepealed  a broad exemption previously available to all nonprofit\r\n\norganizations.

Upon\r\n\nreaching the merits of Rojas's suit,  the district court rejected\r\n\nall of her claims.  On appeal, Rojas argues that the Rhode Island\r\n\nand  FUTA  exemptions  for religions  violate  the  Establishment\r\n\nClause  and   the  Equal   Protection  Clause   of  the   federal\r\n\nConstitution, while  the  appellees reassert  their  claims  that\r\n\njurisdiction is  lacking because of  the Tax  Injunction Act,  28\r\n\nU.S.C.   1341 and that the appellant lacks standing.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          Because we find that the appellant's claims fail on the\r\n\nmerits, we  need not reach  either the  claim put forward  by the\r\n\nfederal defendant-appellee that Rojas lacks standing to challenge\r\n\nFUTA or  the claim  put forward  by the  state defendant-appellee\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nthat the  Tax Injunction Act  bars federal jurisdiction  over the\r\n\nsuit.

She contends,  however,  that  the\r\n\ncurrent 26 U.S.C.   3309, viewed in the wake of the 1970 and 1976\r\n\nAmendments, reflects the purpose of favoring religion rather than\r\n\nthe secular purpose  of providing ease of  administration.

Efficient administration  of the  unemployment\r\n\ncompensation  system   is  particularly   enhanced  through   the\r\n\nexemptions  for religion because  it eliminates the  need for the\r\n\ngovernment to  review employment decisions  made on the  basis of\r\n\nreligious rationales.

We decline Rojas's invitation to read Texas\r                                                                           \r\n\nMonthly  as requiring that  a provision  incidentally benefitting\r                 \r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nreligion must grant a like benefit to every group that could also\r                       \r\n\nconceivably fall within  the secular rationale for  the exemption\r\n\nprovision.

In Texas Monthly,  the other  Texas\r                                                        \r\n\nsales tax exemptions did not serve the same purpose as the narrow\r\n\nexemption  for religious  periodicals, and  thus their  existence\r\n\ncould  not rescue  the  challenged exemption.    By contrast,  an\r\n\nadequate array  of groups are  exempted under the FUTA  and RIESA\r\n\nprovisions,  reinforcing  our   conclusion  that  the   religious\r\n\nexemptions  here   serve  the  legitimate   secular  purpose   of\r\n\nfacilitating  the administration  of  the unemployment  insurance\r\n\nsystem.5\r\n\n          The second  basic Establishment Clause concern  is that\r\n\nof  avoiding the effective promotion or advancement of particular\r\n\nreligions or of religion in  general by the government.
