Smith,\r                                                                             \r\nDirector, New England Bank  Fraud Task Force, and Donald  C. Lockhart,\r                                                                             \r\nTrial Attorney,  New  England Bank  Fraud Task  Force, Fraud  Section,\r\nCriminal Division,  U.S. Department of Justice, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   H. Raymond Kellett  appeals from  the\r                                \r\n\nsummary denial of his  motion for a new trial  and his motion\r\n\nfor reconsideration.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Kellett  was a  closing  attorney for  a  federally\r\n\ninsured  bank, ComFed Savings Bank.  In 1990, he was indicted\r\n\nfor  making false  statements  to ComFed  in violation  of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   1014 and  for obstructing justice.  His  trial ended\r\n\nin  a hung jury.   Thereafter,  a superceding  indictment was\r\n\nreturned.  Kellett then pled guilty to  one count of making a\r\n\nfalse statement to the  bank and to one count  of obstructing\r\n\njustice.   He was sentenced, served his term of imprisonment,\r\n\nand  is  now serving  a term  of  supervised release.   After\r\n\nbringing  two petitions  for post-conviction  relief, Kellett\r\n\nbrought the  motion now before  us.   In a margin  order, the\r\n\ndistrict court denied  the motion; it  also summarily  denied\r\n\nsubsequent  motions to  amend and  to reconsider  the court's\r\n\ndecision. \r\n\n          Kellett's  motion sought  to invalidate  his guilty\r\n\nplea.  According to the motion, Kellett had recently obtained\r\n\nexculpatory  evidence which  the prosecution  had had  in its\r\n\npossession, but had  failed to produce during  discovery.  If\r\n\nthe  withheld evidence  had  been  produced, Kellett's  trial\r\n\nallegedly would likely  have ended in acquittal  and he would\r\n\nnot  have pled  guilty.   In support  of his  motion, Kellett\r\n\nsubmitted his own affidavit and affidavits and a statement by\r\n\nhis  trial  attorney.   Kellett asked  for  a hearing  on his\r\r\n\nclaims  and  a  new trial.    For  reasons  which follow,  we\r\n\naffirm.2  \r\n\n          Because   Kellett  was   never   tried  after   his\r\n\nreindictment, we construe  his motion  for a new  trial as  a\r\n\nmotion  for post-conviction  relief under  28 U.S.C.    2255.\r\n\nSee United States  v. Collins,  898 F.2d 103,  104 (9th  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1990) (per  curiam) (a  defendant who  pleads guilty may  not\r\n\nbring a  motion for a new  trial under Fed. R.  Crim. P. 33).\r\n\nFor argument's sake, we assume that Kellett may challenge his\r\n\nguilty  plea  on the  ground that  the prosecution  failed to\r\n\ndisclose exculpatory evidence.  See Sanchez v. United States,\r                                                                        \r\n\n50 F.3d 1448,  1453 (9th Cir. 1995)  (a defendant challenging\r\n\nthe voluntariness of a guilty plea may assert a Brady claim);\r                                                                 \r\n\nUnited  States v.

Because this appeal is so clearly meritless and rendering\r\na decision on the  merits would not alter the  result reached\r\nbelow,  we agree with the  government that we  may bypass the\r\njurisdictional questions it  raises in  its appellate  brief.\r\nSee  FDIC v. Bay Street  Development Corp., 32  F.3d 636, 639\r                                                      \r\nn.4  (1st Cir. 1994).   In view  of our  disposition, we also\r\ndecline to consider other issues raised by the  government in\r\nits thorough brief, e.g.,  whether Kellett's motion should be\r\ndenied as an abuse of the writ.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n1048  (1986); but see Smith  v. United States,  876 F.2d 655,\r                                                         \r\n\n657  (8th Cir.) (in  pleading guilty, a  defendant waives all\r\n\nnonjurisdictional challenges to  the prosecution, including a\r\n\nclaim  based  on   the  prosecution's  failure   to  disclose\r\n\nfavorable evidence), cert. denied, 493  U.S. 869 (1989).  The\r                                             \r\n\nrelevant question, then, is  whether the withheld information\r\n\nwas  material to Kellett's defense.   The test of materiality\r\n\nin  evaluating  a challenge  to a  guilty  plea based  on the\r\n\nwithholding  of exculpatory  evidence is  whether there  is a\r\n\n\"reasonable probability\" that a defendant would have  refused\r\n\nto  plead  and  would   have  gone  to  trial  but   for  the\r\n\nprosecution's withholding  of the evidence.   See Sanchez, 50\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  at 1454;  accord Wright,  43 F.3d  at 496  (evidence is\r                                         \r\n\nmaterial only if  there is a reasonable  probability that its\r\n\ndisclosure would have altered the result of the proceeding in\r\n\nquestion); compare  White, 858  F.2d at 424  (rejecting Brady\r                                                                         \r\n\nchallenge  to defendant's  Alford  plea because  the withheld\r                                             \r\n\nevidence would  not have  been  \"controlling\" in  defendant's\r\n\ndecision to plead guilty); Campbell, 769  F.2d at 324 (same).\r                                               \r\n\nThe test of  materiality is  an objective one.   Sanchez,  50\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d at 1454.  \r\n\n          Viewed objectively, there  is no question that  the\r\n\nwithheld evidence was not material to Kellett's determination\r\n\nto plead  guilty.  Here,  Kellett essentially pled  guilty to\r\n\nknowingly  making a  false statement  to ComFed  in  order to\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\ninfluence  the bank's action upon a loan application.  See 18\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.C.    1014.  The government's charge against him was that\r\n\nhe had  knowingly signed loan  documents falsely representing\r\n\nthat there  was no secondary financing on  the property being\r\n\nmortgaged.  The withheld  evidence consisted, first, of notes\r\n\nby  Frank Buco,  a co-defendant  and former  ComFed Executive\r\n\nVice-President who pled guilty  to making false statements to\r\n\nComFed  and who  testified for  the prosecution  at Kellett's\r\n\ntrial;  and,  second,  of   a  transcript  of  two  telephone\r\n\nconversations between  James Baldini, a  former President and\r\n\ndirector of  ComFed, and  a person identified  only by  first\r\n\nname in  the transcript.   The Buco notes are  far from self-\r\n\nexplanatory, consisting in large part of incomplete sentences\r\n\nand  phrases,  unexplained  bank jargon,  and  references  to\r\n\nunidentified persons and events.   Without further background\r\n\nexplanation, we cannot see the precise significance of Buco's\r\n\nnotes.  They  refer to Kellett  once, but  the import of  the\r\n\nreference  is unclear.3    They suggest,  as Kellett  argues,\r\n\nthat Jack Zoeller, a ComFed director and President, knew that\r\n\nsecond  mortgages were  being concealed.    If so,  the notes\r\n\nindicate that Buco had information which could have impeached\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The paragraph containing the reference to Kellett reads:\r\n\n     Accusations are made  by Fred Maloof about  scheme.  Ray\r\n     Kellett, abused, Addullah, Ambiehl.  Kick Backs, etc. NO\r\n     DOC  Program stopped  3/89  reluctantly by  Zoeller.   I\r\n     urged him many times to kill program, not loan officers.\r\n     He did it his way.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nZoeller at trial, who allegedly denied any involvement in the\r\n\n\"No  Doc\"  loan program.4   The  notes  may also  suggest, as\r\n\nKellett  claims, that  bank  directors had  willfully ignored\r\n\ninformation  that  loan   applications  with  hidden   second\r\n\nmortgages were being submitted to  the bank, and that Baldini\r\n\nhad  been   involved  in  establishing  the   program.    The\r\n\ndiscussions recorded in the  Baldini transcript involved loan\r\n\ntransactions involving \"bogus  buyers.\"  Neither Baldini  nor\r\n\nthe  person he  spoke with  referred to  Kellett or  to loans\r\n\ninvolving  hidden second  mortgages.   At one  point, Baldini\r\n\nexpressed his dislike  of fraud, adding vaguely that  he \"got\r\n\nset up by  a Board of Directors at Comfed to take a fall that\r\n\nthe US Attorney has cleared  me of.\"  His statement  does not\r\n\nsupport  Kellett's  claim  that  the  transcript  shows  that\r\n\nBaldini,  Zoeller  and  ComFed's  directors  knew  about  and\r\n\nparticipated in the No Doc loan program. \r\n\n          Thus,  the withheld evidence  contains nothing that\r\n\neven hints at Kellett's  innocence.  For argument's sake,  we\r\n\nassume that it clearly  showed that senior bank  officers and\r\n\ndirectors, including Baldini and Zoeller, had approved the No\r\n\nDoc  loan program  and  that they  continued  to promote  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Apparently, the  bank  had  implemented  a  loan  program\r\nwhereby it would approve loan  applications without obtaining\r\ndocuments  verifying   a  borrower's  assets.     It  is  our\r\nunderstanding  that  it  was  the failure  to  require  asset\r\nverification  that permitted  Kellett and  others to  prepare\r\ndocuments  falsely representing  that  there were  no  second\r\nmortgages on the properties in question. \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nprogram   after   becoming  aware   that   loan  applications\r\n\nconcealing second mortgages were being submitted to the bank.\r\n\nAs  a  matter  of  law,  however,  that  evidence  would  not\r\n\nexonerate Kellett.  The case law is clear that the complicity\r\n\nof  a bank or of bank officers is  not a defense in a section\r\n\n1014 prosecution.5   See, e.g., United  States v. Blumenthal,\r                                                                        \r\n\n945 F.2d  280, 282-83  (9th Cir.  1991) (affirming the  lower\r\n\ncourt's  refusal  to  give  jury  instructions  on  the  bank\r\n\nofficers' collusion with the defendant; the  instructions did\r\n\nnot  advance  a \"legally  sound\"  theory);  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nWilcox,  919 F.2d  109, 112  (9th  Cir. 1990)  (affirming the\r                  \r\n\nexclusion of  evidence that bank officers  had told defendant\r\n\nthat he could make the false statements in question);  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.

The  government correctly  notes that we  have previously\r\ndenied  Kellett's  contention   that  the  bank's  complicity\r\nexculpates him under section 1014.  See H. Raymond Kellett v.\r                                                                      \r\nUnited States, No. 93-1843,  at 2-4 (1st Cir.

Brennan, 832\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.  Supp.  435, 448  (D.  Mass. 1991)  (   1014 focuses  on a\r\n\ndefendant's  intent to  influence  the bank  by making  false\r\n\nstatements, not on whether  the bank was actually influenced;\r\n\nthus,  \"it  was  of no  consequence  whether  or  not a  bank\r\n\nofficial knew th[e]  statements were false when  submitted\"),\r\n\naff'd, 994 F.2d 918 (1st Cir. 1993).6\r                 \r\n\n          Viewed   objectively,   therefore,   the   withheld\r\n\nevidence  would not have supported a viable defense and so it\r\n\nwas  not material (except for  the very limited  use it might\r\n\nhave been for impeachment purposes).  See Sanchez, 50 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n1454  (the   withheld  evidence  was  not   material  to  the\r\n\ndefendant's  decision  to plead  guilty  because  one of  the\r\n\ndefenses it allegedly  supported was not viable and the other\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  Kellett's argument concerning  the bank's complicity  may\r\nbe based on  the premise  that any false  statements he  made\r\ncould not have been intended to influence the bank to approve\r\nthe  loans since  the bank  itself had  initiated the  No Doc\r\nprogram and continued it knowing that false loan applications\r\nwere being submitted.   See United States v. Grissom,  44 F3d\r                                                                \r\n1507, 1510 (10th Cir.) (a requisite element of a section 1014\r\nprosecution is  that the defendant has  made false statements\r\nto a bank  for the  purpose of influencing  the bank),  cert.\r                                                                         \r\ndenied,  115 S.  Ct. 1720 (1995).   If so,  his premise would\r                  \r\nseem wrong as a  matter of common sense.  The bank apparently\r\nwould not  have approved  the loan  applications if  they had\r\ndisclosed the  existence  of secondary  financing.    Because\r\nKellett  was willing to close on  documents he knew contained\r\nfalse  representations,  the bank  was  able  to approve  the\r\nloans.\r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nwould \"almost  certainly fail\"  at trial).   Although Kellett\r\n\navers  that he  would not  have pled  guilty if  the withheld\r\n\nevidence had  been produced, he  would have had  no objective\r\n\nlegal basis for  that decision, and  so we have no  basis for\r\n\noverturning his guilty plea.    \r\n\n          We  also  reject  Kellett's argument  that  he  has\r\n\nsteadfastly maintained his innocence and that he did not know\r\n\nthat the loan  documents sent  to him by  the bank  contained\r\n\nfalse statements.   In  order to  obtain  a conviction  under\r\n\nsection 1014,  the prosecution  must show that  the defendant\r\n\nmade  false  statements knowingly.    See  18  U.S.C.    1014\r                                                     \r\n\n(imposing  liability on  those  who  \"knowingly\"  make  false\r\n\nstatements  to a  federally insured  bank); United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nGrissom, 44 F.3d 1507, 1510 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCt.  1720 (1995).  In  his plea agreement,  Kellett agreed to\r\n\nplead  guilty  to  making   false  statements  to  ComFed  in\r\n\nviolation  of section 1014.7   At  his plea  hearing, Kellett\r\n\nconfirmed  that   he  had   informed  his  attorney   of  the\r\n\ncircumstances of  the charge  against him; he  also confirmed\r\n\nthat  his attorney  had advised  him of  the nature  of those\r\n\ncharges  and his possible defenses.   He then  pled guilty to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The page in  the superceding  indictment against  Kellett\r\nwhich describes  Count 25,  the count  to which  Kellett pled\r\nguilty,  is  missing.    The  original  indictment,  however,\r\nexplicitly  charged  Kellett  with \"knowingly\"  making  false\r\nstatements to ComFed; presumably, the  superceding indictment\r\ndid as well.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nviolating section 1014 after  the court had advised  him that\r\n\ndoing so would waive his  right to be presumed innocent.   He\r\n\ndid not  object to the  government's description of  its case\r\n\nagainst him.8   Moreover,  Kellett's attorney stated  that he\r\n\ndid not know  of any reason why  the court should  not accept\r\n\nthe plea.  The court accepted Kellett's plea  as \"voluntarily\r\n\nand  knowledgeably offered.\"   The  court further  found that\r\n\nthere  was  an  independent   basis  of  fact  for  accepting\r\n\nKellett's plea  because of  what he  had  heard at  Kellett's\r\n\ntrial  on the  first  indictment.   Under the  circumstances,\r\n\nKellett  cannot claim  now that  he  did not  knowingly plead\r\n\nguilty,  and cannot  now  protest that  he  was innocent  all\r\n\nalong.   It  is inconceivable  that Kellett's  attorney would\r\n\nhave recommended a guilty plea, or that Kellett, an attorney,\r\n\nwould have pled  guilty, if  Kellett had not  known that  the\r\n\nloan documents he signed contained false statements.  We have\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  The prosecutor stated that she had been prepared to prove\r\nthe following  at trial: that  Kellett had participated  in a\r\nscheme to  conceal  second mortgages  from  the  underwriting\r\ndepartment at the bank; that, in connection with one specific\r\nloan  application,  Kellett  had  prepared or  caused  to  be\r\nprepared a  HUD-1 settlement statement, a  HUD-1 certificate,\r\nand a Fannie Mae affidavit, all of which falsely  represented\r\nthat no  second mortgage on the property in question existed;\r\nthat Kellett had signed those documents, thereby vouching for\r\ntheir veracity; that the  bank had granted a mortgage  on the\r\nbasis  of those  documents;  that the  mortgage violated  the\r\nbank's underwriting guidelines and the mortgagor subsequently\r\ndefaulted; and that ComFed was a federally insured bank.   \r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nno basis for  relieving Kellett  of the  consequences of  his\r\n\ninformed and voluntary decision to plead guilty.9\r\n\n          On appeal, Kellett also argues that the trial court\r\n\ninitiated plea discussions with  him in chambers in violation\r\n\nof Fed.  R. Crim. P.  11(e).   We do not  address that  claim\r\n\nsince it was not squarely raised below.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nOcasio-Rivera, 991  F.2d  1,  3 (1st  Cir.  1993).    Kellett\r                         \r\n\nsuggests as well that the  court should have recused  itself.\r\n\nBecause  he failed to file a motion below seeking the court's\r\n\ndisqualification or recusal, that  claim is not before  us on\r\n\nappeal.  See  United States v. Towns, 913 F.2d  434, 443 (7th\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1990); United States v. De La Fuente, 548  F.2d 528, 541\r                                                     \r\n\n(5th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 932 (1977).\r                                    \r\n\n          Because Kellett's claim that his guilty plea should\r\n\nbe overturned was meritless, no hearing was required.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  In  view  of  his  plea hearing  and  sentencing  hearing\r\ntranscripts, we discount entirely Kellett's claim that he had\r\nonly  accepted responsibility on behalf of his office.  It is\r\ntrue that  his presentence  investigation report  records his\r\ncomment that he accepted responsibility for his subordinates'\r\nconduct.   At sentencing,  the government asked  the court to\r\ndeny Kellett a two-level reduction in his base offense  level\r\nbecause of Kellett's  equivocal acceptance of responsibility;\r\nit maintained that Kellett was  \"trying to . . . walk  a thin\r\nline so as to preserve his bar membership.\"  In any event, in\r\nresponse to  questioning by the court,  Kellett unequivocally\r\nagreed  that he accepted responsibility for the two counts of\r\nthe indictment to which he had pled guilty.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n",

Raymond Kellett appeals from the summary denial of his motion for a new trial and his motion for reconsideration.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kellett was a closing attorney for a federally insured bank, ComFed Savings Bank.  In 1990, he was indicted for making false statements to ComFed in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014 and for obstructing justice.  His trial ended in a hung jury.  Thereafter, a superceding indictment was returned.  Kellett then pled guilty to one count of making a false statement to the bank and to one count of obstructing justice.  He was sentenced, served his term of imprisonment, and is now serving a term of supervised release.  After bringing two petitions for post-conviction relief, Kellett brought the motion now before us.  In a margin order, the district court denied the motion;  it also summarily denied subsequent motions to amend and to reconsider the court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kellett's motion sought to invalidate his guilty plea.  According to the motion, Kellett had recently obtained exculpatory evidence which the prosecution had had in its possession, but had failed to produce during discovery.  If the withheld evidence had been produced, Kellett's trial allegedly would likely have ended in acquittal and he would not have pled guilty.  In support of his motion, Kellett submitted his own affidavit and affidavits and a statement by his trial attorney.  Kellett asked for a hearing on his claims and a new trial.  For reasons which follow, we affirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Kellett was never tried after his reindictment, we construe his motion for a new trial as a motion for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.  See United States v. Collins, 898 F.2d 103, 104 (9th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (a defendant who pleads guilty may not bring a motion for a new trial under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 33).  For argument's sake, we assume that Kellett may challenge his guilty plea on the ground that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence.  See Sanchez v. United States, 50 F.3d 1448, 1453 (9th Cir.1995) (a defendant challenging the voluntariness of a guilty plea may assert a Brady claim);  United States v. Wright, 43 F.3d 491, 496 (10th Cir.1994) (under limited circumstances, a Brady violation can render a defendant's plea involuntary);  White v. United States, 858 F.2d 416, 422 (8th Cir.1988) (Supreme Court precedent did not foreclose a Brady challenge to a guilty plea), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1029 (1989);  Campbell v. Marshall, 769 F.2d 314, 321 (6th Cir.1985) (similar), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1048 (1986);  but see Smith v. United States, 876 F.2d 655, 657 (8th Cir.)  (in pleading guilty, a defendant waives all nonjurisdictional challenges to the prosecution, including a claim based on the prosecution's failure to disclose favorable evidence), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 869 (1989).  The relevant question, then, is whether the withheld information was material to Kellett's defense.  The test of materiality in evaluating a challenge to a guilty plea based on the withholding of exculpatory evidence is whether there is a \"reasonable probability\" that a defendant would have refused to plead and would have gone to trial but for the prosecution's withholding of the evidence.  See Sanchez, 50 F.3d at 1454;  accord Wright, 43 F.3d at 496 (evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that its disclosure would have altered the result of the proceeding in question);  compare White, 858 F.2d at 424 (rejecting Brady challenge to defendant's Alford plea because the withheld evidence would not have been \"controlling\" in defendant's decision to plead guilty);  Campbell, 769 F.2d at 324 (same).  The test of materiality is an objective one.  Sanchez, 50 F.3d at 1454.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed objectively, there is no question that the withheld evidence was not material to Kellett's determination to plead guilty.  Here, Kellett essentially pled guilty to knowingly making a false statement to ComFed in order to influence the bank's action upon a loan application.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.  The government's charge against him was that he had knowingly signed loan documents falsely representing that there was no secondary financing on the property being mortgaged.  The withheld evidence consisted, first, of notes by Frank Buco, a co-defendant and former ComFed Executive Vice- President who pled guilty to making false statements to ComFed and who testified for the prosecution at Kellett's trial;  and, second, of a transcript of two telephone conversations between James Baldini, a former President and director of ComFed, and a person identified only by first name in the transcript.  The Buco notes are far from self-explanatory, consisting in large part of incomplete sentences and phrases, unexplained bank jargon, and references to unidentified persons and events.  Without further background explanation, we cannot see the precise significance of Buco's notes.  They refer to Kellett once, but the import of the reference is unclear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  They suggest, as Kellett argues, that Jack Zoeller, a ComFed director and President, knew that second mortgages were being concealed.  If so, the notes indicate that Buco had information which could have impeached Zoeller at trial, who allegedly denied any involvement in the \"No Doc\" loan program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The notes may also suggest, as Kellett claims, that bank directors had willfully ignored information that loan applications with hidden second mortgages were being submitted to the bank, and that Baldini had been involved in establishing the program.  The discussions recorded in the Baldini transcript involved loan transactions involving \"bogus buyers.\"  Neither Baldini nor the person he spoke with referred to Kellett or to loans involving hidden second mortgages.  At one point, Baldini expressed his dislike of fraud, adding vaguely that he \"got set up by a Board of Directors at Comfed to take a fall that the US Attorney has cleared me of.\"  His statement does not support Kellett's claim that the transcript shows that Baldini, Zoeller and ComFed's directors knew about and participated in the No Doc loan program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the withheld evidence contains nothing that even hints at Kellett's innocence.  For argument's sake, we assume that it clearly showed that senior bank officers and directors, including Baldini and Zoeller, had approved the No Doc loan program and that they continued to promote the program after becoming aware that loan applications concealing second mortgages were being submitted to the bank.  As a matter of law, however, that evidence would not exonerate Kellett.  The case law is clear that the complicity of a bank or of bank officers is not a defense in a section 1014 prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., United States v. Blumenthal, 945 F.2d 280, 282-83 (9th Cir.1991) (affirming the lower court's refusal to give jury instructions on the bank officers' collusion with the defendant;  the instructions did not advance a \"legally sound\" theory);  United States v. Wilcox, 919 F.2d 109, 112 (9th Cir.1990) (affirming the exclusion of evidence that bank officers had told defendant that he could make the false statements in question);  United States v. Bush, 599 F.2d 72, 75 (5th Cir.1979) (affirming the lower court's refusal to instruct the jury that the defendant's false statements could not have been made to influence the bank because the bank's president knew the statements were false;  Sec. 1014 does not \"immunize a party in duplicity with a bank officer\");  United States v. Johnson, 585 F.2d 119, 123-25 (5th Cir.1978) (affirming the exclusion of evidence about bank officers' complicity;  the bank's awareness of the fraud is not relevant since its existence is not inconsistent with the defendant's possessing the requisite intent to influence);  United States v. Brennan, 832 F. Supp. 435, 448 (D.Mass.1991) (Sec. 1014 focuses on a defendant's intent to influence the bank by making false statements, not on whether the bank was actually influenced;  thus, \"it was of no consequence whether or not a bank official knew th[e] statements were false when submitted\"), aff'd, 994 F.2d 918 (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed objectively, therefore, the withheld evidence would not have supported a viable defense and so it was not material (except for the very limited use it might have been for impeachment purposes).  See Sanchez, 50 F.3d at 1454 (the withheld evidence was not material to the defendant's decision to plead guilty because one of the defenses it allegedly supported was not viable and the other would \"almost certainly fail\" at trial).  Although Kellett avers that he would not have pled guilty if the withheld evidence had been produced, he would have had no objective legal basis for that decision, and so we have no basis for overturning his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject Kellett's argument that he has steadfastly maintained his innocence and that he did not know that the loan documents sent to him by the bank contained false statements.  In order to obtain a conviction under section 1014, the prosecution must show that the defendant made false statements knowingly.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014 (imposing liability on those who \"knowingly\" make false statements to a federally insured bank);  United States v. Grissom, 44 F.3d 1507, 1510 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1720 (1995).  In his plea agreement, Kellett agreed to plead guilty to making false statements to ComFed in violation of section 1014.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  At his plea hearing, Kellett confirmed that he had informed his attorney of the circumstances of the charge against him;  he also confirmed that his attorney had advised him of the nature of those charges and his possible defenses.  He then pled guilty to violating section 1014 after the court had advised him that doing so would waive his right to be presumed innocent.  He did not object to the government's description of its case against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Moreover, Kellett's attorney stated that he did not know of any reason why the court should not accept the plea.  The court accepted Kellett's plea as \"voluntarily and knowledgeably offered.\"  The court further found that there was an independent basis of fact for accepting Kellett's plea because of what he had heard at Kellett's trial on the first indictment.  Under the circumstances, Kellett cannot claim now that he did not knowingly plead guilty, and cannot now protest that he was innocent all along.  It is inconceivable that Kellett's attorney would have recommended a guilty plea, or that Kellett, an attorney, would have pled guilty, if Kellett had not known that the loan documents he signed contained false statements.  We have no basis for relieving Kellett of the consequences of his informed and voluntary decision to plead guilty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Kellett also argues that the trial court initiated plea discussions with him in chambers in violation of Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11(e).  We do not address that claim since it was not squarely raised below.  See United States v. Ocasio- Rivera, 991 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993).  Kellett suggests as well that the court should have recused itself.  Because he failed to file a motion below seeking the court's disqualification or recusal, that claim is not before us on appeal.  See United States v. Towns, 913 F.2d 434, 443 (7th Cir.1990);  United States v. De La Fuente, 548 F.2d 528, 541 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 431 U.S. 932 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Kellett's claim that his guilty plea should be overturned was meritless, no hearing was required.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because this appeal is so clearly meritless and rendering a decision on the merits would not alter the result reached below, we agree with the government that we may bypass the jurisdictional questions it raises in its appellate brief.  See FDIC v. Bay Street Development Corp., 32 F.3d 636, 639 n.4 (1st Cir.1994).  In view of our disposition, we also decline to consider other issues raised by the government in its thorough brief, e.g., whether Kellett's motion should be denied as an abuse of the writ</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The paragraph containing the reference to Kellett reads:</p>\n        <p>Accusations are made by Fred Maloof about scheme.

In that appeal, the Buco notes and Baldini transcript were not in the record, although Kellett's reply brief in that case referred to them</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Kellett's argument concerning the bank's complicity may be based on the premise that any false statements he made could not have been intended to influence the bank to approve the loans since the bank itself had initiated the No Doc program and continued it knowing that false loan applications were being submitted.  See United States v. Grissom, 44 F3d 1507, 1510 (10th Cir.)  (a requisite element of a section 1014 prosecution is that the defendant has made false statements to a bank for the purpose of influencing the bank), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 1720 (1995).  If so, his premise would seem wrong as a matter of common sense.  The bank apparently would not have approved the loan applications if they had disclosed the existence of secondary financing.  Because Kellett was willing to close on documents he knew contained false representations, the bank was able to approve the loans</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The page in the superceding indictment against Kellett which describes Count 25, the count to which Kellett pled guilty, is missing.

Raymond Kellett appeals from the summary denial of his motion for a new trial and his motion for reconsideration.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kellett was a closing attorney for a federally insured bank, ComFed Savings Bank.  In 1990, he was indicted for making false statements to ComFed in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014 and for obstructing justice.  His trial ended in a hung jury.  Thereafter, a superceding indictment was returned.  Kellett then pled guilty to one count of making a false statement to the bank and to one count of obstructing justice.  He was sentenced, served his term of imprisonment, and is now serving a term of supervised release.  After bringing two petitions for post-conviction relief, Kellett brought the motion now before us.  In a margin order, the district court denied the motion;  it also summarily denied subsequent motions to amend and to reconsider the court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kellett's motion sought to invalidate his guilty plea.  According to the motion, Kellett had recently obtained exculpatory evidence which the prosecution had had in its possession, but had failed to produce during discovery.  If the withheld evidence had been produced, Kellett's trial allegedly would likely have ended in acquittal and he would not have pled guilty.  In support of his motion, Kellett submitted his own affidavit and affidavits and a statement by his trial attorney.  Kellett asked for a hearing on his claims and a new trial.  For reasons which follow, we affirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Kellett was never tried after his reindictment, we construe his motion for a new trial as a motion for post-conviction relief under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 2255.  See United States v. Collins, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537814\"><a href=\"/opinion/537814/united-states-v-charles-r-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 104 (9th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (a defendant who pleads guilty may not bring a motion for a new trial under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 33).  For argument's sake, we assume that Kellett may challenge his guilty plea on the ground that the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory evidence.  See Sanchez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692307\"><a href=\"/opinion/692307/javier-hincapie-sanchez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1448</span></a></span>, 1453 (9th Cir.1995) (a defendant challenging the voluntariness of a guilty plea may assert a Brady claim);  United States v.

The relevant question, then, is whether the withheld information was material to Kellett's defense.  The test of materiality in evaluating a challenge to a guilty plea based on the withholding of exculpatory evidence is whether there is a \"reasonable probability\" that a defendant would have refused to plead and would have gone to trial but for the prosecution's withholding of the evidence.  See Sanchez, 50 F.3d at 1454;  accord Wright, 43 F.3d at 496 (evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that its disclosure would have altered the result of the proceeding in question);  compare White, 858 F.2d at 424 (rejecting Brady challenge to defendant's Alford plea because the withheld evidence would not have been \"controlling\" in defendant's decision to plead guilty);  Campbell, 769 F.2d at 324 (same).  The test of materiality is an objective one.  Sanchez, 50 F.3d at 1454.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed objectively, there is no question that the withheld evidence was not material to Kellett's determination to plead guilty.  Here, Kellett essentially pled guilty to knowingly making a false statement to ComFed in order to influence the bank's action upon a loan application.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014.  The government's charge against him was that he had knowingly signed loan documents falsely representing that there was no secondary financing on the property being mortgaged.  The withheld evidence consisted, first, of notes by Frank Buco, a co-defendant and former ComFed Executive Vice- President who pled guilty to making false statements to ComFed and who testified for the prosecution at Kellett's trial;  and, second, of a transcript of two telephone conversations between James Baldini, a former President and director of ComFed, and a person identified only by first name in the transcript.  The Buco notes are far from self-explanatory, consisting in large part of incomplete sentences and phrases, unexplained bank jargon, and references to unidentified persons and events.  Without further background explanation, we cannot see the precise significance of Buco's notes.  They refer to Kellett once, but the import of the reference is unclear.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  They suggest, as Kellett argues, that Jack Zoeller, a ComFed director and President, knew that second mortgages were being concealed.  If so, the notes indicate that Buco had information which could have impeached Zoeller at trial, who allegedly denied any involvement in the \"No Doc\" loan program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The notes may also suggest, as Kellett claims, that bank directors had willfully ignored information that loan applications with hidden second mortgages were being submitted to the bank, and that Baldini had been involved in establishing the program.  The discussions recorded in the Baldini transcript involved loan transactions involving \"bogus buyers.\"  Neither Baldini nor the person he spoke with referred to Kellett or to loans involving hidden second mortgages.  At one point, Baldini expressed his dislike of fraud, adding vaguely that he \"got set up by a Board of Directors at Comfed to take a fall that the US Attorney has cleared me of.\"  His statement does not support Kellett's claim that the transcript shows that Baldini, Zoeller and ComFed's directors knew about and participated in the No Doc loan program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the withheld evidence contains nothing that even hints at Kellett's innocence.  For argument's sake, we assume that it clearly showed that senior bank officers and directors, including Baldini and Zoeller, had approved the No Doc loan program and that they continued to promote the program after becoming aware that loan applications concealing second mortgages were being submitted to the bank.  As a matter of law, however, that evidence would not exonerate Kellett.  The case law is clear that the complicity of a bank or of bank officers is not a defense in a section 1014 prosecution.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., United States v. Blumenthal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568598\"><a href=\"/opinion/568598/united-states-v-michael-i-blumenthal/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span>, 282-83 (9th Cir.1991) (affirming the lower court's refusal to give jury instructions on the bank officers' collusion with the defendant;  the instructions did not advance a \"legally sound\" theory);  United States v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span>, 448 (D.Mass.1991) (Sec. 1014 focuses on a defendant's intent to influence the bank by making false statements, not on whether the bank was actually influenced;  thus, \"it was of no consequence whether or not a bank official knew th[e] statements were false when submitted\"), aff'd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608079\"><a href=\"/opinion/608079/united-states-v-james-f-brennan-united-states-v-j-edward-mchugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed objectively, therefore, the withheld evidence would not have supported a viable defense and so it was not material (except for the very limited use it might have been for impeachment purposes).  See Sanchez, 50 F.3d at 1454 (the withheld evidence was not material to the defendant's decision to plead guilty because one of the defenses it allegedly supported was not viable and the other would \"almost certainly fail\" at trial).  Although Kellett avers that he would not have pled guilty if the withheld evidence had been produced, he would have had no objective legal basis for that decision, and so we have no basis for overturning his guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also reject Kellett's argument that he has steadfastly maintained his innocence and that he did not know that the loan documents sent to him by the bank contained false statements.  In order to obtain a conviction under section 1014, the prosecution must show that the defendant made false statements knowingly.  See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1014 (imposing liability on those who \"knowingly\" make false statements to a federally insured bank);  United States v. Grissom, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686757\"><a href=\"/opinion/686757/united-states-v-lloyd-steven-grissom/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1507</span></a></span>, 1510 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1720</span></span> (1995).  In his plea agreement, Kellett agreed to plead guilty to making false statements to ComFed in violation of section 1014.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  At his plea hearing, Kellett confirmed that he had informed his attorney of the circumstances of the charge against him;  he also confirmed that his attorney had advised him of the nature of those charges and his possible defenses.  He then pled guilty to violating section 1014 after the court had advised him that doing so would waive his right to be presumed innocent.  He did not object to the government's description of its case against him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Moreover, Kellett's attorney stated that he did not know of any reason why the court should not accept the plea.  The court accepted Kellett's plea as \"voluntarily and knowledgeably offered.\"  The court further found that there was an independent basis of fact for accepting Kellett's plea because of what he had heard at Kellett's trial on the first indictment.  Under the circumstances, Kellett cannot claim now that he did not knowingly plead guilty, and cannot now protest that he was innocent all along.  It is inconceivable that Kellett's attorney would have recommended a guilty plea, or that Kellett, an attorney, would have pled guilty, if Kellett had not known that the loan documents he signed contained false statements.  We have no basis for relieving Kellett of the consequences of his informed and voluntary decision to plead guilty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Kellett also argues that the trial court initiated plea discussions with him in chambers in violation of Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 11(e).  We do not address that claim since it was not squarely raised below.  See United States v. Ocasio- Rivera, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604815\"><a href=\"/opinion/604815/united-states-v-richard-ocasio-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1993).  Kellett suggests as well that the court should have recused itself.  Because he failed to file a motion below seeking the court's disqualification or recusal, that claim is not before us on appeal.  See United States v. Towns, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547526\"><a href=\"/opinion/547526/united-states-v-kenneth-towns-also-known-as-kareem-allahdeem/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">434</span></a></span>, 443 (7th Cir.1990);  United States v.

In view of our disposition, we also decline to consider other issues raised by the government in its thorough brief, e.g., whether Kellett's motion should be denied as an abuse of the writ</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The paragraph containing the reference to Kellett reads:</p>\n        <p>Accusations are made by Fred Maloof about scheme.

See H. Raymond Kellett v. United States, No. 93-1843, at 2-4 (1st Cir.  Apr. 6, 1994).  In that appeal, the Buco notes and Baldini transcript were not in the record, although Kellett's reply brief in that case referred to them</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Kellett's argument concerning the bank's complicity may be based on the premise that any false statements he made could not have been intended to influence the bank to approve the loans since the bank itself had initiated the No Doc program and continued it knowing that false loan applications were being submitted.  See United States v. Grissom, 44 F3d 1507, 1510 (10th Cir.)  (a requisite element of a section 1014 prosecution is that the defendant has made false statements to a bank for the purpose of influencing the bank), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1720</span></span> (1995).  If so, his premise would seem wrong as a matter of common sense.  The bank apparently would not have approved the loan applications if they had disclosed the existence of secondary financing.  Because Kellett was willing to close on documents he knew contained false representations, the bank was able to approve the loans</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The page in the superceding indictment against Kellett which describes Count 25, the count to which Kellett pled guilty, is missing.  The original indictment, however, explicitly charged Kellett with \"knowingly\" making false statements to ComFed;  presumably, the superceding indictment did as well</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The prosecutor stated that she had been prepared to prove the following at trial:  that Kellett had participated in a scheme to conceal second mortgages from the underwriting department at the bank;  that, in connection with one specific loan application, Kellett had prepared or caused to be prepared a HUD-1 settlement statement, a HUD-1 certificate, and a Fannie Mae affidavit, all of which falsely represented that no second mortgage on the property in question existed;  that Kellett had signed those documents, thereby vouching for their veracity;  that the bank had granted a mortgage on the basis of those documents;  that the mortgage violated the bank's underwriting guidelines and the mortgagor subsequently defaulted;  and that ComFed was a federally insured bank</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> In view of his plea hearing and sentencing hearing transcripts, we discount entirely Kellett's claim that he had only accepted responsibility on behalf of his office.  It is true that his presentence investigation report records his comment that he accepted responsibility for his subordinates' conduct.  At sentencing, the government asked the court to deny Kellett a two-level reduction in his base offense level because of Kellett's equivocal acceptance of responsibility;  it maintained that Kellett was \"trying to ... walk a thin line so as to preserve his bar membership.\"  In any event, in response to questioning by the court, Kellett unequivocally agreed that he accepted responsibility for the two counts of the indictment to which he had pled guilty</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
