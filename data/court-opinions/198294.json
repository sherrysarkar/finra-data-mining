Robinson, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,\r\nU.S. Department of Justice, Theresa M.B. Van Vliet, Chief, Narcotic \r\nand Dangerous Drug Section, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of\r\nJustice, Robert Lipman and Grace Chung Becker, Trial Attorneys,\r\nNarcotic and Dangerous Drug Section, Criminal Division, U.S.\r\nDepartment of Justice, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                      \r\n\nJanuary 22, 1999                  \r\n                                              TORRUELLA, Chief Judge.  Defendant-appellants were charged with\r\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and distribution\r\nof cocaine base, cocaine, heroin, and marijuana, in violation of\r\n21 U.S.C.  841 &amp; 846.  In addition, Count 43 of the indictment\r\ncharged Nelson Ortiz-Bez (\"Ortiz-Bez\") with engaging in a\r\nmonetary transaction in criminally derived property, in violation\r\nof 18 U.S.C.  1957.  Count 46 charged Eulalio and Moiss\r\nCandelaria-Silva with possessing cocaine base, cocaine and heroin\r\nwith intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1). \r\nCount 49 alleged the defendants' joint and several liability for\r\nforfeiture of $6,000,000, including substitute assets, as\r\n            authorized by 21 U.S.C.  853.\r\n    The jury returned guilty verdicts as to all of the defendants in\r\nthis appeal as well as special forfeiture verdicts.  The district\r\ncourt sentenced the defendants to the following terms of\r\nimprisonment:  (1) 480 months for Ortiz-Bez; (2) 540 months for\r\nRal Ortiz-Miranda (\"Ortiz-Miranda\"); (3) 210 months for Celenia\r\nReyes-Padilla (\"Reyes-Padilla\"); (4) 168 months for Rosa Morales-\r\nSantiago (\"Morales-Santiago\"); (5) 660 months for Eulalio\r\nCandelaria-Silva; (6) 360 months for Moiss Candelaria-Silva; and\r\n(7) 480 months for Jos Rosado-Rosado (\"Rosado-Rosado\").  The\r\ndistrict court also issued a Final Order of Forfeiture\r\nencompassing substitute property of Reyes-Padilla, pursuant to 21\r\n                  U.S.C.  853(p). \r\n    Defendants base their appeal on numerous evidentiary and\r\nprocedural grounds.  For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the\r\n           judgment of the district court.\r\nBACKGROUND The government presented the testimony of three co-\r\nconspirator witnesses, Marcos Hidalgo-Melndez (\"Hidalgo\"),\r\nCarlos Otero-Coln (\"Otero-Coln\"), and Noem Garca-Otero\r\n(\"Garca-Otero\").  Hidalgo pleaded guilty to Count One of the\r\nSuperseding Indictment.  Otero-Coln and Garca-Otero received\r\nimmunity from prosecution in exchange for their cooperation.  In\r\naddition, the government presented the testimony of numerous\r\nlocal police officers who executed search warrants or were\r\notherwise involved in the investigation of the defendants and\r\ntheir co-conspirators.  The government also presented documentary\r\nand forensic evidence and testimony relating to firearms and\r\ndrugs seized from the co-conspirators, and other pertinent\r\nevidence.                       \r\n    The co-conspirator witnesses testified that Israel Santiago-Lugo\r\n(\"Santiago-Lugo\") operated several drug distribution points\r\n(\"puntos\") at various housing projects in the northern region of\r\nPuerto Rico.  With the assistance of his co-conspirators,\r\nSantiago-Lugo distributed vast quantities of controlled\r\nsubstances including:  1) heroin sold under the name \"cristal\";\r\n(2) cocaine sold under the names \"bolso rojo\" and \"rolito\"; (3)\r\n           cocaine base; and (4) marijuana.                 A.  The Virgilio Dvila Punto\r\n    Hidalgo testified that he, Ortiz-Bez, and Wilfredo and David\r\nMartnez-Matta began working for Santiago-Lugo's drug\r\ndistribution ring sometime after Hidalgo moved to the Virgilio\r\nDvila housing project in 1990.  He also testified that Ortiz-\r\nBez and others packaged drugs at two rented apartments in Isla\r\nVerde and transported the drugs to various puntos. Hidalgo\r\nfurther testified that Reyes-Padilla, Santiago-Lugo's aunt,\r\ndistributed drugs from a Virgilio Dvila apartment used by\r\nSantiago-Lugo's grandparents.  From this apartment, Morales-\r\nSantiago supplied Santiago-Lugo's distributors with drugs,\r\nincluding heroin and cocaine, and maintained a ledger to account\r\n             for the drugs and proceeds.\r\n    On October 6, 1989, the Police of Puerto Rico (\"POPR\") executed a\r\nsearch warrant at Virgilio Dvila building 43, apartment 411. \r\nReyes-Padilla was at the apartment with her parents.  The search\r\nyielded twenty-six grams of cocaine and three grams of heroin\r\npackaged in over 250 small bags.  Later, on October 17, 1989, the\r\nPOPR executed a search warrant at the same apartment.  When an\r\nofficer first arrived, a young man was selling a controlled\r\nsubstance through an iron grating on the apartment door.  When\r\nthe officer identified himself, the man fled inside the\r\napartment.  A search of the apartment yielded two grams of\r\nheroin, less than a gram of cocaine, and over $2000 in U.S.\r\n                      currency.\r\n    At trial, POPR officer Angel Nieves-Domnguez testified that,\r\npursuant to a tip, he conducted surveillance of Reyes-Padilla at\r\nVirgilio Dvila building 43, apartment 412 during the afternoon\r\nof October 1 and the morning of October 2, 1991.  On the first\r\nday, he observed Reyes-Padilla and Santiago-Lugo retrieve two\r\nlarge bags from the trunk of Santiago-Lugo's car.  Upon reaching\r\nthe stairs to building 43, Santiago-Lugo opened one of the brown\r\nbags and pulled out several transparent plastic bags that each\r\ncontained smaller red bags.  As Santiago-Lugo distributed the\r\nplastic bags to the persons assembled, Reyes-Padilla made\r\nnotations in a notebook.  Additionally, upon receiving the\r\npackages, some recipients hid the packages in nearby garbage cans\r\nor bushes.  Reyes-Padilla took the other large brown bag up to\r\n                    apartment 412.\r\n    After Santiago-Lugo left, the officer observed one individual --\r\nwho had received a package from Santiago-Lugo -- apparently\r\nselling some of the smaller red bags to a young woman near\r\nbuilding 44.  Shortly thereafter, a young man arrived at\r\napartment 412, and Reyes-Padilla sold the man a transparent bag\r\nappearing to contain heroin. The next day, the officer saw\r\nSantiago-Lugo arrive and deliver yet another brown bag to Reyes-\r\n                      Padilla. \r\n    Later that month, POPR executed a search warrant at apartment\r\n412.  At that time, defendants Reyes-Padilla and Morales-Santiago\r\nwere in the apartment.  The search yielded four \"decks\" of heroin\r\nin a Sucrets box, approximately $100,000 in U.S. currency, and\r\ntwo notebooks appearing to contain records of drug deliveries and\r\n                        debts.\r\n    In November, POPR officers observed Rosado-Rosado and a minor\r\neach engage in an apparent sale of controlled substances and give\r\nthe proceeds from the sale to a heavy-set individual.  Rosado-\r\nRosado retrieved the drugs from a brown paper bag in his back\r\npants pocket.  When officers entered the housing project, Rosado-\r\nRosado and the minor attempted to flee.  Officers caught Rosado-\r\nRosado and seized eighteen aluminum foil packets containing\r\n       heroin and five bags containing cocaine.\r\n    Hidalgo testified at trial about the importance of the Virgilio\r\nDvila punto as a drug distribution site.  He stated that he\r\npersonally received packages of cocaine and heroin from Morales-\r\nSantiago to distribute on behalf of Israel Santiago-Lugo, and\r\nthat he observed distributors from Santiago-Lugo's other puntos\r\narrive at Virgilio Dvila and receive packages from Morales-\r\nSantiago.  He identified four pages of notebook entries under the\r\nname \"Batman\"  from the notebook seized in October 1991 that\r\npertained to his distribution of marijuana and cocaine at\r\n                  Virgilio Dvila.  \r\n    Among the entries in the notebook was one pertaining to fifty\r\npackets of heroin, referred to as \"C\" to correspond to \"cristal,\"\r\nand one pertaining to fifty packets of cocaine, referred to as\r\n\"R\" because of the brand name \"bolso rojo.\"  Expert testimony\r\nshowed that the entries recorded transactions transpiring almost\r\ndaily between October 29, 1990 and October 24, 1991.  The\r\nnotebooks contained a \"price structure\" table which specified the\r\nprices of multiple units with a base price of $75 per unit.  A\r\nconservative estimate of the amount of drugs distributed would be\r\nclose to 50,000 units having a total value of approximately $3.5\r\n                   million dollars.\r\n               B.  The Rosario Brothers\r\n    In 1993, Hidalgo learned that Santiago-Lugo and the Rosario\r\nbrothers had become adversaries.  Santiago-Lugo and the Rosarios\r\npreviously had agreed to share control of the drug distribution\r\npunto at Virgilio Dvila in Bayamn.  According to Hidalgo, the\r\nenmity between them stemmed from a drug debt owed to Santiago-\r\nLugo by one of the Rosarios.  Tensions escalated in early 1993\r\nwhen a Santiago debt collector and a Rosario associate were both\r\n                      murdered.\r\n    In June 1993, Hidalgo sustained a gunshot wound when an unknown\r\nassailant or assailants fired a barrage of bullets from a moving\r\nvehicle near Virgilio Dvila.  After recuperating, Hidalgo again\r\nrejoined the conspiracy.  On December 1, 1993, Hidalgo, Ortiz-\r\nBez, Santiago-Lugo, and co-conspirator Andrs Coln-Miranda were\r\narrested in Bayamn.  Ortiz-Bez, Hidalgo, and Coln-Miranda were\r\nin possession of firearms without proper permits.  Hidalgo\r\ntestified that they were armed due to the ongoing tensions with\r\n                the Rosario brothers.\r\nC.  The Los Murales Punto\r\nOtero-Coln testified that, sometime in 1988 or 1989, Santiago-\r\nLugo's brother Ral and Jorge Martnez-Rosado (\"Fobi\") reached an\r\nagreement with Jos Romn Freites (\"Josean\") for the distribution\r\nof cristal heroin at Los Murales.  Otero-Coln, who had served as\r\na lookout for Josean for approximately two months, became a\r\nrunner who picked up drugs from Virgilio Dvila.  He testified\r\nthat he began picking up fifty packages, each containing ten\r\npackets of heroin and costing $70.  Eventually, he would pick up\r\nas many as 100 packages every three of four days, each costing\r\n$75.\r\nOtero-Coln further testified that, after the POPR searched\r\nReyes-Padilla's Virgilio Dvila apartment, the distribution\r\noperation was moved to the apartment of Morales-Santiago, who\r\nalso kept notebooks reflecting drug deliveries and debts.  He\r\nstated that Ortiz-Bez and others who worked at the \"table\" in\r\nIsla Verde were right-hand men for Santiago-Lugo.  These men\r\nwould sometimes transport drugs to Los Murales when Otero-Coln\r\ncould not.  When Reyes-Padilla was out of heroin, Santiago would\r\ndirect Otero-Coln to obtain it from another distribution group\r\nand keep the profits.\r\nHidalgo testified that he supervised cocaine and marijuana\r\ndistribution at the Los Murales housing project in 1991 and 1992,\r\nand that during his tenure, all of the drugs distributed there\r\nbelonged to Santiago-Lugo.  He knew Otero-Coln as an individual\r\nwho would come to the Virgilio Dvila punto to obtain heroin for\r\nSantiago-Lugo's punto at Los Murales.\r\nD.  The Villa Evangelina Punto\r\nOtero-Coln identified defendant-appellant Eulalio Candelaria-\r\nSilva as \"Macho Gatillo,\" the overseer of the drug point at the\r\nVilla Evangelina housing project.  Otero-Coln testified that he\r\nmet the Candelaria-Silvas, including Moiss and Luis, after\r\nJosean agreed with Santiago-Lugo to distribute cocaine at Los\r\nMurales in exchange for a reduction in the price of heroin\r\ndistributed there.  Otero-Coln stated that he would obtain\r\ncocaine from Ral Santiago-Lugo at Virgilio Dvila and transport\r\nthe drugs to Eulalio and Moiss' house in Manat for processing\r\nto sell at Los Murales and Villa Evangelina.  Eulalio Candelaria-\r\nSilva would pick up the proceeds from Otero-Coln.  Moiss\r\nassumed Eulalio's role after the latter was incarcerated.\r\nOtero-Coln testified that the Candelaria-Silvas began to\r\ndistribute \"cristal\" at Villa Evangelina.  On two occasions in\r\n1990, an undercover police officer made controlled purchases of\r\ncocaine from Eulalio Candelaria-Silva at Villa Evangelina.  In\r\naddition, POPR officers executed search warrants at the\r\nCandelaria home in 1993 and February 1995.  The 1993 search\r\nyielded controlled substances including \"cristal\" heroin.\r\nIn addition, the government introduced into evidence a letter\r\nthat had been seized from the residence of Israel Santiago-Lugo\r\nin August 1993.  The letter was addressed from \"Ral\" to \"Macho,\"\r\nand indicated that both of them were in jail at the same time. \r\nThe letter appeared to discuss price negotiations, and refer to\r\nmembers of the Candelaria family.\r\nE.  The Enrique Catoni Punto\r\nNoem Garca-Otero testified that defendant-appellant Rosado-\r\nRosado was introduced to her as \"Hormiguita,\" the supervisor of\r\nheroin, cocaine, and marijuana sales at Enrique Catoni.  Ral\r\nSantiago-Lugo introduced Ortiz-Bez as \"Mickey Mouse.\"  On one\r\noccasion, Raul Santiago-Lugo drove Ortiz-Bez to the Ramn-Sol\r\nhousing project in Arecibo and left him there to supervise.  On\r\nanother occasion, Ortiz-Bez and Rosado-Rosado recruited\r\nindividuals to distribute drugs at the housing project.  In\r\naddition, Garca-Otero identified defendant-appellant Ral Ortiz-\r\nMiranda as someone who would bring drugs to, and pick up money\r\nfrom, the housing project on at least a weekly basis.  She\r\ntestified that she knew Ortiz-Miranda as \"Cano Beeper.\"\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.  Jury Selection\r\n     Defendant-appellants argue that the district court violated the\r\nFifth and Sixth Amendments, the Jury Selection and Service Act of\r\n1968 (\"the Act\"), 28 U.S.C.  1861, Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(b), and\r\nthe Amended Plan for the Random Selection of Grand and Petit\r\nJurors for the United States District Court for Puerto Rico\r\n(\"District Plan\") by ex parte eliminating jurors from the venire.\r\nA.  The Jury Selection Act\r\nThe Act was enacted to ensure that potential jurors are selected\r\nat random from a representative cross-section of the community\r\nand that all qualified citizens have an opportunity to be\r\nconsidered for service.  See H.R. Rep. No. 1076 (1968), 1968 U.S.\r\nC.C.A.N. 1792.  The Act provides that each district court devise\r\na \"local plan\" for the selection of jurors consistent with the\r\nobjectives of randomness and nondiscrimination set forth in \r\n1861 and 1862.  See  1863.  The local plan for the District of\r\nPuerto Rico was devised and approved pursuant to  1863.\r\n     The Act sets forth five specific reasons a summoned juror may be\r\nexcused by the district court.  They are:  (1) undue hardship;\r\n(2) inability to render impartial service; (3) peremptory\r\nchallenge; (4) good cause shown; and (5) a determination by the\r\ncourt that his service as a juror would be likely to threaten the\r\nsecrecy of the proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect the\r\nintegrity of the jury deliberations, that the exclusion is\r\nwarranted, and that the exclusion is not inconsistent with other\r\nprovisions of the Act.  See 28 U.S.C.  1866(c).  Section 1866(c)\r\nprovides that the court may only exclude a person under (5) in\r\nopen court.\r\n     1.  Jury Orientation\r\nOf eighty prospective jurors in the panel for this case, only\r\nsixty-two appeared for jury orientation on the morning of\r\nSeptember 13, 1995.  At the orientation, conducted on the record\r\nbut outside the presence of counsel, the district court gave\r\npreliminary instructions regarding jury service and distributed\r\nthe juror questionnaires.  He told the jurors nothing specific\r\nabout the case except the docket number.  The judge then\r\ninstructed the jurors not to discuss the case with anyone, spoke\r\nto them about the importance of jury service, and described the\r\nquestionnaire.  The judge left the courtroom while the jurors\r\nviewed the video \"Justice by the People\" and completed the\r\nquestionnaires.  Upon their completion of the questionnaires, the\r\njudge returned and excused the jurors for the day.  Because only\r\nfifty prospective jurors remained after the morning orientation\r\nsession on September 13, the court summoned thirteen additional\r\nrandomly selected prospective jurors from two other panels. \r\nThese prospective jurors, and one late-arriving member of the\r\noriginal panel, then received substantially the same information\r\nand instructions from the judge and completed the questionnaires.\r\n    During jury selection the next day, it became clear to Ortiz-\r\nMiranda's counsel that some of the juror questionnaires were\r\nmissing.  Upon raising the matter with the district court, the\r\njudge explained to counsel that the clerk had \"highlighted\"\r\ncertain questionnaires as \"problematic,\" and he had \"dealt with\r\nthose obvious cases.\"  9/14/95 Tr. at 126.  Ortiz-Miranda's\r\ncounsel objected to the district court's actions on the ground\r\nthat it \"involv[ed] and invok[ed] Fifth and Sixth Amendment\r\nrights.\"  Id.  The court overruled counsel's objections, but\r\nagreed to provide counsel with the questionnaire forms and\r\ninvited counsel to further object after reviewing them if counsel\r\nfound that the court had \"exercised the [sic] improper\r\ndiscretion,\" id., in excusing fourteen prospective jurors brought\r\nto his attention by the jury clerk.\r\n        a.  Lack of Qualifications Dismissals\r\n    In order to be deemed qualified to serve as a juror on a petit\r\njury in the United States District Court for the District of\r\nPuerto Rico, an individual must be a citizen of the United\r\nStates, eighteen years of age or older, have resided for a period\r\nof one year within the judicial district, and be \"able to read,\r\nwrite, speak, and understand the English language with a degree\r\nof proficiency sufficient to fill out satisfactorily the Juror\r\nQualification Form and to render satisfactory jury service in\r\nthis Court.\"  District Plan at 3.\r\n    The district court dismissed six of the prospective jurors based\r\non a lack of proficiency in English.  Juror 16 stated that she\r\nhad difficulty reading or understanding English and answered the\r\nquestion asking her to describe her work in general terms in\r\nSpanish.  Juror 17 completed almost all of the questionnaire in\r\nSpanish.  Juror 18 indicated that she had difficulty with English\r\nand also wrote in Spanish that she did not hear well.  Juror 45\r\ncompleted the forms entirely in Spanish.  Juror 61 indicated that\r\nhe had trouble with English and did not give more than a one word\r\nresponse in English to any of the questions requiring more than a\r\nyes or no answer.  Finally, Juror 93 indicated that he had\r\ntrouble reading or understanding English, but otherwise completed\r\nthe questionnaire in English.  After examining these\r\nquestionnaires, we hold that Judge Fust did not err by\r\ndismissing these prospective jurors.\r\n    The District Plan also mandates that \"[n]o person shall be\r\nqualified to serve . . . if he is incapable, by reason of mental\r\nor physical infirmity, to render satisfactory jury service.\"  Id.\r\nThe district court excused two jurors for medical reasons.  Juror\r\n13 answered \"No\" to the question, \"Do you have any physical\r\nproblem (for example, sight, hearing or other medical condition)\r\nthat would interfere with your ability to serve?\" but a note at\r\nthe bottom of the form states \"Eye ongoing medical [illegible].\" \r\nThe government contends that this note was made by the district\r\ncourt, but the author's identity is unclear.  The district court\r\ndid write on the beginning of the form:  \"See note [page] 3\r\nclaimed ongoing eye impediment.\"  Juror 89 stated that he had\r\n\"Fibrilosis Atrial\" and that he was currently taking daily\r\nmedication.  The district court excused him on account of his\r\nhealth and because of his answer to question #9.  Question #9\r\nasked the degree of education the prospective juror had achieved. \r\nJuror 89 had a law degree, but was retired.  Although the\r\ndistrict court's actions, with respect to these two jurors, were\r\nquestionable in that Juror 13 did not state that his medical\r\ncondition would interfere with his serving as a juror and Juror\r\n89 was dismissed in part because he holds a law degree, there was\r\nat least some medical reason why both jurors could have been\r\nexcused.  Accordingly, these excusals were not an abuse of\r\ndiscretion.  See United States v. Contreras, 108 F.3d 1255, 1269\r\n(10th Cir. 1997) (applying abuse of discretion standard to pre\r\nvoir dire excusals).\r\n          b. Undue Hardship Dismissals\r\nBoth  1866 and the District Plan permit the district court to\r\nexcuse prospective jurors prior to voir dire on the ground of\r\n\"undue hardship.\"  Here, the district court excused six jurors on\r\nthat basis.\r\nAccording to the district court's notes, Juror 3 was excused\r\nbecause he was the only person at his office.  Juror 3 stated\r\nthat he \"was the only representative of the company in Puerto\r\nRico.  I sell generic medicine to Drug [sic] stores and Hospitals\r\n[sic] in P.R[.]  My Job [sic] is mostly done by telemarketing for\r\nwhich I can not be away from my work for too long.  I m [sic]\r\ntraining a part time employee to assist me due the [sic] increase\r\nin sales.\"  The district court excused Juror 32 because she was\r\ntaking care of her mother, who was in the hospital, and her\r\ngrandmother, who was at home.  Although she was the \"only one\"\r\nwho could help them, she stated that she would \"be very proud to\r\nparticipate as a juror . . . and to let [her] know what [she]\r\nshould do.\"  According to his notes, Judge Fust excused Juror 70\r\nbecause he was a night shift medical technician at Fajardo\r\nHospital.\r\nJurors 35, 63, and 72 indicated that they had various business\r\nand personal travel plans that would conflict with the trial. \r\nJuror 35 stated that she would be traveling during the trial to a\r\n\"Consumers Affairs annual meeting\" and then \"intend[ed] to take\r\nmy vacations.\"  Juror 63 was excused by the district court on\r\naccount of a pre-arranged vacation.  During the trial, she was\r\nscheduled to attend a training session and to leave with her\r\nfamily on a previously planned vacation.  Finally, Juror 72 was\r\nexcused because he had a reservation to go to Nevada and\r\nCalifornia for a month during the trial.\r\nThe district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing\r\nJurors 3 and 32, but did impermissibly excuse Jurors 70, 35, 63,\r\nand 72.  With regard to Jurors 3 and 32, their questionnaires\r\ndocument that acting as Jurors would work an undue hardship. \r\nHowever, the same cannot be said for the others.  \r\nWith regard to Juror 70, we note that under the District Plan, he\r\ncould have requested to be excused from jury duty.  The District\r\nPlan states that jury service by medical laboratory technicians\r\nwould entail undue hardship or extreme inconvenience, and such an\r\nindividual \"shall be excused from jury service upon individualrequest.\"  District Plan at 5 (emphasis added).  However, Juror\r\n70 did not request to be excused or object to being a juror.  The\r\nchoice not to serve on the jury at this stage was his and not the\r\ncourt's.  The district court acted improperly in unilaterally\r\nexcusing him from jury service.  We cannot be sure whether Juror\r\n70 desired to serve or was unaware of the District Plan's\r\nprovision.  Regardless of his desire or knowledge, however, there\r\nwas no prima facie reason for him to have been dismissed from the\r\npool at this point.   \r\nWe begin by noting with respect to Jurors 35, 63, and 72 that the\r\ndistrict court incorrectly described their situation to counsel\r\nthe next morning at jury selection.  The district court stated: \r\n\"What else was there? And people with paid vacations, which they\r\nso said in a note, Judge, I'm leaving on such and such a date. \r\nHow can I detain those people?\"  9/14/95 Tr. at 127.  After a\r\nvery close and careful reading of the questionnaires, we did not\r\nfind any notes on them stating that any of these jurors had paid\r\nvacations.  If such a statement was made by any of the jurors to\r\nthe district court, it was not recorded by the Judge on the\r\nquestionnaires in the record.  Jurors 35 \"intend[ed]\" to take\r\nvacations.  For Juror 63, \"everything was set.\"  Finally, Juror\r\n72 had a \"reservation.\"  It appears that the district court\r\ninterpreted those phrases to mean paid non-refundable, non-\r\nchangeable tickets although those phrases may well not have meant\r\nthat at all.\r\nJury duty works a burden on all called to serve.  There are\r\ninstances in which previously-made travel plans would cause jury\r\nservice to become an undue hardship.  However, the district court\r\nall too willingly accepted the proposed excuses of these jurors\r\nwithout allowing the parties to examine the prospective jurors in\r\nvoir dire. Exclusions at this stage approach a ministerial\r\nfunction, which is why  1866 authorizes the clerk of the court\r\nunder the supervision of the district court -- if the District\r\nPlan so authorizes -- to excuse such jurors. See  1866(c).  If\r\njurors are excused as a result of a non-ministerial exercise of\r\ndiscretion better left to voir dire itself, as occurred here, the\r\nprospects for the defendant obtaining a fair cross-section of the\r\ncommunity could be improperly diminished.\r\nIn general, we think it unwise for district judges to engage in\r\nex parte voir dire beyond purely ministerial functions. \r\nMinisterial functions permitted by the Plan and Act are usually\r\nperformed by the clerk, under supervision of the court.  If a\r\njudge does no more than what a jury clerk is authorized to do in\r\nexcusing  jurors, that may raise an issue of allocation of court\r\nresources but does not raise an issue of impropriety.  See United\r\nStates v. Calaway, 524 F.2d 609, 619 (9th Cir. 1975).  When the\r\ncourt, in the absence of counsel, starts questioning jurors and\r\nexcusing them based on responses which go beyond basic\r\ninformation about qualifications, obvious bias, or hardship, it\r\nis all too easy to slip over the line, as happened here.  Whether\r\nslipping over the line deprives a defendant of statutory or\r\nconstitutional rights is another question.\r\n     2.  The Remedy\r\nHaving established that certain of the exclusions were not\r\njustified under the Act, we turn to the question of whether the\r\nAct provides appellants with a remedy.  By its terms, the Act\r\nonly provides a remedy -- the stay of proceedings pending the\r\nselection of a petit jury in conformity with the Act -- for\r\nsubstantial failures to comply with its provisions.  See \r\n1867(d); United States v. Calabrese, 942 F.2d 218, 226 (3d Cir.\r\n1991).  In order to obtain this remedy, a party challenging the\r\njury selection process under the Act must make his challenge\r\n\"before the voir dire examination begins, or within seven days\r\nafter the defendant discovered or could have discovered, by the\r\nexercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is\r\nearlier.\"   1867(a).  The timeliness requirement \"is to be\r\nstrictly construed, and failure to comply precisely with its\r\nterms forecloses a challenge under the Act.\"  United States v.\r\nParadies, 98 F.3d 1266, 1277 (11th Cir. 1996) (citation omitted). \r\n\"[O]nce voir dire begins, Jury Selection Act challenges are\r\nbarred, even where the grounds for the challenge are discovered\r\nonly later.\"  Id. at 1278 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). \r\nThe Act requires that any motion filed be accompanied by a \"sworn\r\nstatement of facts which, if true, would constitute a substantial\r\nfailure to comply with provisions of [the Act].\"   1867(d). \r\nWhen that requirement is not satisfied, the challenge to the\r\nselection process must fail, because \"Congress left no room for\r\nad hoc review of the usefulness of compliance with [the sworn\r\nstatement] requirement.\"  Paradies, 98 F.3d at 1278 (citation\r\nomitted).\r\nOrtiz-Miranda's counsel objected after the district court gave\r\ncounsel the list of the remaining prospective jurors and his\r\ninstructions for making challenges.  She stated the reasons for\r\nher objection and the district court took notice.  See 9/14/95\r\nTr. at 129.  Counsel next asked if the transcript was available. \r\nSee id.  The court stated:  \"The transcript is not available.\" \r\nId.  Counsel next asked for a continuance, which was denied.  Seeid.  But, the district court told counsel that she \"can examine\r\nthe forms\" and that there would be \"an accounting made by the\r\njury clerk,\" id. at 129-30, but that it would not be done \"now,\"\r\nid. at 130, because there was \"[n]o need to do that now.\"  Id.\r\nWith a transcript of the above events, it would seem that there\r\nwould be no quarrel as to what occurred.  Unfortunately, that is\r\nnot the case.  In a Memorandum Order dated August 11, 1998, the\r\ndistrict court took issue with Ortiz-Miranda's brief, stating:\r\n\"Contrary to what is stated in the brief on appeal, counsel for\r\nall defendants, as well as trial attorneys for the Department of\r\nJustice, were given copies of [the original questionnaires of\r\nthose excused] before jury selection commenced in the case now on\r\nappeal.\"  8/11/98 Memorandum Order at 1 (emphasis added).  He\r\ncontinued: \"The preparation of the photocopies and sets of\r\ndocuments were turned over to counsel before jury selection was\r\nsupervised . . . and I made certain that all attorneys of record\r\nreceived a set of the pertinent documents so that they could\r\nmeaningfully participate in the jury selection process.\"  Id. at\r\n2.  We note that the parties do not agree with the court's\r\nassertion that the materials in the case were turned over to them\r\nin the above described fashion.  Both the defendant-appellants\r\nand the government, relying on the transcript of the proceeding\r\nand the materials in the record,  state that the materials were\r\nturned over to the parties after the commencement of voir dire.\r\nOrtiz-Miranda states that the record does not disclose when the\r\nquestionnaires were actually provided to counsel.  The government\r\ncontends that the record suggests that \"the questionnaires were\r\nmade available sometime after commencement of voir dire, but on\r\nSeptember 14, 1995,\" Government's Resp. to Ortiz-Miranda's Mot.\r\nat 3 (based on a memorandum from the district court to the Clerk\r\nof the Court and the Jury Administrator dated that day) or the\r\nquestionnaires were \"filed under seal in the Clerk's Office on\r\nSeptember 19, 1995, the day after the presentation of evidence\r\nbegan.\"  Id. (based on Doc. 655 which was signed by Judge Fust\r\non September 19, 1995).\r\nUnder the Act, the challenge along with the signed affidavit must\r\nbe filed before the commencement of voir dire.  Obviously, this\r\nwas not possible here because the record establishes that jury\r\nselection commenced before counsel had any opportunity to\r\ndiscover that prospective jurors had been excused.  In any event,\r\nwe choose not to wrestle with the thorny question of whether the\r\ndistrict court's actions mitigated counsel's duty to comply with\r\nthe Act. Even if all had proceeded ideally, the district court's\r\nerroneous exclusions did not constitute a \"substantial failure\"\r\nto comply with the Act.  See  1867(d).\r\nCongress left the content of this term largely up to the courts. \r\nSee 1968 U.S. C.C.A.N. at 1794 (\"Your committee would leave the\r\ndefinition of 'substantial' to the process of judicial\r\ndecision.\").  In determining whether a violation is substantial,\r\n\"the alleged violations must be weighed against the underlying\r\nprinciples of the Act.\"  United States v. Gregory, 730 F.2d 692,\r\n699 (11th Cir. 1984).  These principles are:  (1) the random\r\nselection of jurors; and (2) the determination of\r\ndisqualifications, excuses, exemptions, and exclusions on the\r\nbasis of objective criteria only.  See id.  The inquiry is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\n     For wrongful exclusions, determining whether there has been a\r\n     substantial violation has both quantitative and qualitative\r\n     aspects.  Quantitatively, a substantial violation generally will\r\n     not be found if the numbers of errors is small.  Qualitatively,\r\n     the inquiry is whether there has been a frustration of the Act's\r\n     underlying principle of exclusions on the basis of objective\r\n     criteria only.\r\n\nCalabrese, 942 F.2d at 227-28 (citation omitted).  Here, the\r\nnumber of arguably wrongfully excluded jurors was very small. \r\nFurther, the Act's principle of exclusions on the basis of\r\nobjective criteria was not frustrated.  In excusing the four\r\nindividuals, the district court did not engage in qualitatively\r\nimproper actions such as creating a \"new category of exclusions,\"\r\nsee id. at 228, or discriminating against a  class of persons. \r\nSee id.  Second, the district court did not prevent the jury\r\npanel from consisting of a fair cross-section of the community. \r\nSee United States v. Bearden, 659 F.2d 590, 602 (5th Cir. 1981). \r\nHis actions, though improper, did not constitute a substantial\r\nfailure to comply with the Act.\r\nB.  Other Claims\r\nDefendant-appellants also argue that their rights under the Fifth\r\nAmendment, the Sixth Amendment, and Fed. R. Crim. P. 43 were\r\nviolated by the district court's ex parte actions.  To the extent\r\nthat the district court improperly dismissed four prospective\r\njurors, we conclude that the errors were harmless to the\r\ndefendants.  See id. at 1270 n.11 (stating that the error must be\r\nsufficiently egregious to constitute a constitutional violation).II.  The Macho Gatillo Alias\r\nEulalio Candelaria-Silva argues that the district court abused\r\nits discretion by refusing to strike his alias, \"Macho Gatillo,\"\r\nfrom the Superseding Indictment.  He contends that the use of the\r\nalias was inflammatory, demeaning and prejudicial.\r\nIn denying the motion to strike, the district court stated that\r\n\"Macho Gatillo\" served the purpose of a proper name for\r\nidentification purposes.  The record reflects that the POPR\r\nofficer who conducted two undercover drug purchases from\r\nCandelaria-Silva in 1990 knew him only as \"Macho Gatillo.\"  In\r\naddition, co-conspirator witness Otero-Coln also identified the\r\ndefendant only by his street name.  Furthermore, another POPR\r\nofficer corroborated these mutually consistent identifications of\r\nthe defendant by testifying that the defendant was known as\r\n\"Macho.\"  All of this evidence was probative with respect to\r\nidentifying Eulalio Candelaria-Silva as the author of the letter\r\nseized from Israel Santiago-Lugo's residence -- a letter signed\r\n\"Macho\" that discussed the operations of a punto.\r\nIt is true that the record reflects the existence of at least one\r\nother individual who answered to the name \"Macho.\"  For this\r\nreason, the POPR undercover officer and Otero-Coln's use of the\r\n\"Gatillo\" portion of the name, which translates as \"trigger,\" was\r\nprobative to distinguish the defendant.\r\nEulalio Candelaria-Silva's argument fails because the evidence of\r\nhis alias was relevant, and there was no prejudice.  See United\r\nStates v. Delpit, 94 F.3d 1134, 1146 (8th Cir. 1996) (noting that\r\nthe use of the name \"Monster\" was necessary to fully identify the\r\ndefendant); United States v. Persico, 621 F. Supp. 842, 860-61\r\n(S.D.N.Y. 1985) (stating that aliases and nicknames are proper in\r\nan indictment where they will be part of the government's proof\r\nat trial).\r\nIII.  Co-Conspirator Testimony\r\nMoiss Candelaria-Silva argues that the district court should\r\nhave excluded the letter seized from the residence of Israel\r\nSantiago-Lugo.  The court admitted this exhibit pursuant to Fed.\r\nR. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) which defines as non-hearsay a statement by\r\na party's co-conspirator made during and in furtherance of the\r\nconspiracy.  We find Moiss Candelaria-Silva's argument without\r\nmerit.\r\nThe district court conditionally admitted certain evidence\r\npursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) after making the requisite\r\nfindings pursuant to United States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632,\r\n638 (1st Cir. 1980).  Later, the court expressly found that the\r\nletter met the \"in furtherance of\" requirement of 801(d)(2)(E). \r\nAt the end of trial, the court made the requisite determination\r\nfor unconditional admission of the letter and other evidence.\r\nAs grounds for exclusion at trial, Moiss Candelaria-Silva argued\r\nthat there existed a legitimate doubt as to whether Macho Gatillo\r\nwas a member of this charged conspiracy at the time he wrote the\r\nletter.  He renews this argument on appeal. \r\nLetters can fall within the co-conspirator exception to the\r\nhearsay rule.  See United States v. Richardson, 14 F.3d 666, 668-\r\n70 (1st Cir. 1994).  In this case, there is more than sufficient\r\nevidence that the statements in the letter were made by a co-\r\nconspirator during and in furtherance of the charged conspiracy. \r\nFirst, the seizure of the letter from Israel Santiago-Lugo's\r\nresidence and references in the letter to the recipient's brother\r\nincline toward a finding that the addressee was Israel Santiago-\r\nLugo's brother, Ral.  Furthermore, the writer, \"Macho Gatillo\" -\r\n- Eulalio Candelaria-Silva -- refers to the involvement of his\r\nmother in the transactions discussed.  The 1993 seizure of\r\ncristal heroin at the Candelaria-Silva residences occurred in the\r\npresence of Eulalio Candelaria-Silva's mother and Moiss\r\nCandelaria-Silva.  In addition, the testimony of Otero-Coln\r\nabout the Candelaria-Silvas' roles at Villa Evangelina, and the\r\ncontent of the letter, particularly its reference to the specific\r\nbrand of heroin constitute strong evidence that the letter was\r\nprepared by a co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the\r\ncharged conspiracy.  As this Court stated in United States v.\r\nDrougas:\r\n     The source of the placemats [on which a series of handwritten\r\n     names and numbers appear], the circumstances surrounding their\r\n     seizure, the fact that the information corresponded to other\r\n     evidence of the participants in the conspiracy, and the extreme\r\n     unlikelihood that such a list would be prepared by one not privy\r\n     to the operation of the conspiracy provide a sufficient basis to\r\n     infer that the writings pertained to the conspiracy alleged and\r\n     were made in furtherance of that conspiracy.\r\n\n748 F.2d 8, 26 (1st Cir. 1984).\r\nHere, as in Drougas, the extreme unlikelihood that such a letter\r\nwould be prepared by one not privy to the operation of the\r\n\"cristal\" heroin conspiracy provides a sufficient basis to infer\r\nthat the letter pertained to the conspiracy alleged and that the\r\nstatements therein were made in furtherance of that conspiracy. \r\nSee Drougas, 748 F.2d at 26.  In light of the overall evidence in\r\nthe case, the references to the specific brand of heroin and the\r\nstatements about price and quantity, the district court did not\r\nclearly err by admitting the evidence.\r\nIV.  Motion in Limine\r\nA.  Evidence of Prior Dispositions\r\nOrtiz-Bez, Reyes-Padilla, and Moiss Candelaria-Silva contend\r\nthat the district court erred in prohibiting them from presenting\r\nevidence about the prior dispositions of certain local criminal\r\ncharges relating to conduct involved in the charged conspiracy. \r\nSpecifically, the defendants argue that the court's decision\r\nprohibited them from presenting a defense.  We agree with the\r\ndistrict court that the prior dispositions were not admissible.\r\nIn deciding this issue, the district court explained that the\r\nlocal prosecutions were not relevant to this prosecution because\r\npossible explanations for the early dismissals included \"lack of\r\nevidence, unavailability of witnesses, sloppy presentation by the\r\nstate prosecutors, irresponsible legal determinations, and the\r\nsort.\"  9/14/95 Order at 3.  Furthermore, the district court\r\nrejected the defendants' arguments as \"a disguised attempt to\r\nargue a double jeopardy defense before the jury.\"  Id. at 4.  The\r\ndistrict court's order was proper and in accordance with this\r\nCourt's recent decision in United States v. Smith, 145 F.3d 458,\r\n461 (1st Cir. 1998), holding that an acquittal instruction is not\r\nrequired when evidence of acquitted conduct is introduced.\r\nIn Smith, a defendant, indicted for a drug offense and a tax\r\noffense, was acquitted of the drug offense after a trial on that\r\ncharge alone.  During the subsequent trial on the tax offense,\r\nthe government presented evidence of drug trafficking to\r\ndemonstrate receipt of income that was not reported to the IRS. \r\nOn appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in\r\nrefusing to inform the jury of his acquittal on the drug charge\r\nand in barring his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses on\r\ntheir knowledge of that acquittal.  The defendant in Smith, like\r\nthe defendants in this case, relied on language in the Supreme\r\nCourt's decision in Dowling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342\r\n(1990), to support this position.  In Dowling, the trial court\r\ninstructed the jury that the defendant had been acquitted of\r\nrobbing a witness and the witness's testimony was admitted for a\r\nlimited purpose.  As we noted when rejecting the defendant's\r\nargument in Smith, however, \"the sentence in Dowling that begins,\r\n'Especially in light of the limiting instructions' does not\r\nidentify the language to which 'limiting instruction' refers.\" \r\nSmith, 145 F.3d at 461.  Furthermore, since an instruction was\r\ngiven in Dowling, the Supreme Court did not decide the exclusion\r\nissue.  See Smith 145 F.3d at 461.\r\nThe reasons supporting exclusion of evidence about the dismissal\r\nof a prior prosecution are even stronger than those that support\r\nexclusion with respect to a prior acquittal.  As the district\r\ncourt noted, cases are dismissed for many reasons unrelated to\r\nthe defendant's guilt.  The introduction of evidence of a\r\ndismissal could well mislead the jury into thinking that a\r\ndefendant was innocent of the dismissed charge when no such\r\ndetermination has been made.\r\nB.  Certificate of Good Conduct\r\nMoiss Candelaria-Silva argues that, under Fed. R. Evid. 405, the\r\ntrial court should have admitted a \"certificate of good conduct.\" \r\nSee Defendant's Br. at 23-30.  The district court, describing the\r\ncertificate as a \"negative criminal record\" certified by the\r\nPuerto Rico Police, excluded the document. We hold that the\r\ncertificate of good conduct is not admissible character evidence.\r\nIn United States v. DeJongh, 937 F.2d 1 (1st Cir. 1991), the\r\ndistrict court declined to admit what this Court described as a\r\n\"Good Conduct Certificate.\"  This Court upheld exclusion on the\r\nground of insufficient authentication.\r\nFurthermore, the certificate of good conduct does not satisfy\r\nFed. R. Evid. 405, which allows proof of character:  (1) by\r\n\"specific instances of conduct,\" id., on cross-examination or\r\nwhere \"character or a trait of character . . . is an essential\r\nelement of a charge, claim, or defense,\" id.; or (2) by\r\n\"testimony as to reputation or . . . in the form of an opinion.\" \r\nId. Here, Candelaria-Silva cannot allege that the proffered\r\ncertificate of good conduct meets either of these requirements.\r\nV.  Judicial Bias\r\nDefendant Moiss Candelaria-Silva contends that the trial court\r\nexhibited judicial bias when it: (1) ruled on numerous\r\nevidentiary issues during trial; and (2) chastised counsel in\r\nfront of the jury.  See Defendant's Br. at 35-40.  On review,\r\nthis Court considers \"isolated incidents in light of the entire\r\ntranscript so as to guard against magnification on appeal of\r\ninstances which were of little importance in their setting.\" \r\nUnited States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 779 (1st Cir. 1994)\r\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Furthermore,\r\nthis Court must \"differentiate between expressions of impatience,\r\nannoyance or ire, on the one hand, and bias or partiality, on the\r\nother hand.\"  Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1045 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nOn several occasions, this Court has held that a trial judge's\r\nfrustration displayed at sidebar does not deprive a defendant of\r\na fair trial.  See, e.g., United States v. Polito, 856 F.2d 414,\r\n417-19 (1st Cir. 1988) (no bias where, at sidebar, judge warns\r\ndefense counsel that he is being reported to the State Bar\r\nAssociation for violating rules of professional conduct); Dearyv. City of Gloucester, 9 F.3d 191, 194-96 (1st Cir. 1993) (no\r\nbias where, at sidebar, the trial judge told defense counsel his\r\ncross-examination of a witness was \"very devious\").  Here, Moiss\r\nCandelaria-Silva has failed: (1) to demonstrate that the trial\r\ncourt's actions rise to the level of bias; and (2) to meet his\r\nburden of demonstrating serious prejudice.\r\n Moiss Candelaria-Silva complains that a number of evidentiary\r\nrulings show bias.  We have examined those rulings and find they\r\nwere all proper in the exercise of the court's discretion.\r\nAccordingly, Moiss Candelaria-Silva does not demonstrate\r\njudicial bias with his complaints concerning: (1) the use of the\r\ncharts prepared by the government; (2) the display of photographs\r\nof firearms, ammunition and drugs to the jury; (3) the admission\r\nof testimony of an expert witness to explain the drug ledgers;\r\n(4) the exclusion of evidence of prior acquittals; (5) the\r\nexclusion of defense impeachment evidence concerning past\r\ninstances of untruthfulness; (6) the exclusion of a utility bill\r\nto establish Moiss Candelaria-Silva's place of residence as\r\ndifferent from his mother's house; (7) the district court's\r\napplication of Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E); (8) its admission of\r\nevidence of allegedly unrelated murders and misconduct by\r\ndefendants; or (9) its alleged approval of the government's use\r\nof leading questions.\r\nSimilarly, Moiss Candelaria-Silva's complaint about the trial\r\ncourt's \"facial expressions,\"  Defendant's Br. at 37, falls short\r\nof the mark.  The transcript indicates that after an extensive\r\ndiscussion among all defense counsel, at least two defense\r\ncounsel indicated that the district judge did not cover his mouth\r\nor make faces when weapons were introduced into evidence.  See10/27/95 Tr. at 1861.  Perhaps one defense counsel accurately\r\nsummed up the situation when he remarked:  \"I would also say for\r\nthe record, I have been able to perceive a very high tension\r\namong all counsel.  And that every small incident, in my opinion,\r\nis blown out of proportion.\"  Id. at 1883-84.\r\nAssuming arguendo that the trial court exhibited frustration from\r\ntime to time during this rather lengthy, heated trial, the strong\r\ninstructions given by the trial court during and at the end of\r\nthe trial should have eliminated any conceivable prejudice.  For\r\nexample, shortly after the bench conference regarding facial\r\nexpressions, the district court instructed the jury:  \r\n     Remember also what I told you at the beginning, when we started\r\n     the first day when I impaneled you.  Nothing that the court may\r\n     say or do during the course of this trial is intended to indicate\r\n     nor should be taken by you as indicating what your verdict should\r\n     be.  Also, as you have perceived, throughout this trial, trial\r\n     practice is very demanding of judges and attorneys and sometimes\r\n     there exists at a given trial colloquy between the court and\r\n     counsel.  This colloquy sometimes is easy going and sometimes I,\r\n     as a judge, have to take a stand to keep proceedings returning in\r\n     an orderly way.  It is very important for all of you to\r\n     understand that any colloquy between court and counsel is not to\r\n     be considered by you in determining the issues of this case.\r\n\nId.  at 1995.  Such jury instructions are an appropriate means to\r\n\"allay[] potential prejudice.\"  Logue, 103 F.3d at 1046-47\r\n(citation omitted).\r\nThus, Moiss Candelaria-Silva has failed to meet his burden of\r\nshowing serious prejudice.VI.  Rule 16\r\nOrtiz-Miranda argues that the district court should have\r\nsuppressed Garca-Otero's identification testimony as the fruit\r\nof a Rule 16 discovery violation.  Although Ortiz-Miranda argued\r\nfor suppression of the identification on the merits in the\r\ndistrict court, see 11/16/95 Tr. at 3449-52, 3479-82, he never\r\nsought suppression as a discovery sanction.  Therefore, this\r\nargument is waived.  See United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546,\r\n554 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Issues not squarely raised in the district\r\ncourt will not be entertained on appeal.\").\r\nVII.  Jury Instructions\r\nOrtiz-Miranda argues that the evidence at trial mandated an\r\ninstruction explaining the particular concerns attendant to\r\neyewitness identification and explicitly stating that a guilty\r\nverdict required a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt. \r\nSee Defendant's Br. at 46. However, we have expressly \"declined\r\nto adopt . . . a rule of per se reversal [for such an error],\r\nchoosing not to constrain district courts with yet another\r\nmandatory requirement.\"  United States v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169,\r\n1206 n.20 (1st Cir.) (citing United States v. Kavanaugh, 572 F.2d\r\n9, 13 (1st Cir. 1978)), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 845 (1990). \r\nContrary to Ortiz Miranda's assertion, he was not entitled to a\r\nparticular instruction on the facts of this case.  As this Court\r\nfurther stated in Angiulo:\r\n     [T]he refusal to give a particular requested instruction,\r\n     however, is reversible error only if the instruction (1) is\r\n     substantively correct;  (2) was not substantially covered in the\r\n     charge actually delivered to the jury; and (3) concerns an\r\n     important point in the trial so that the failure to give it\r\n     seriously impaired the defendant's ability to effectively present\r\n     a given defense.\r\n\n897 F.2d at 1205 (internal quotation marks and citations\r\nomitted).\r\nHere, Ortiz-Miranda has not satisfied the second and third prongs\r\nof the Angiulo test. First, the district court's charge\r\nsubstantially covered the identification issue:\r\n     Let's now discuss the subject of how is it that you gauge or\r\n     assess the credibility of witnesses . . . . In making that\r\n     decision, you may take into account a number of factors,\r\n     including the following:\r\n\n     One, was the witness able to see or hear or know the things about\r\n     which that witness testified? \r\n\n     Two, what kind of opportunity did the witness have to observe\r\n     facts or identify people, including the accused?\r\n\n     Three, how well was the witness able to recall and describe those\r\n     things or persons observed?\r\n\n     Four, how positive was the witness' recollection of facts and the\r\n     identification of people, including those accused?\r\n\n     Five, what was the witness' manner while testifying?  By\r\n     \"manner,\" I mean appearance, demeanor.\r\n\n     Six, . . . was the witness ever confused as to facts or the\r\n     identification of persons, or did he or she misidentify or fail\r\n     to identify a person or the accused on prior occasions?\r\n\n12/1/95 Tr. at 4554-55 (emphasis added).\r\nSecond, Garca-Otero testified twice at trial, and thus Ortiz-\r\nMiranda had ample opportunity to develop the identification\r\ndefense during cross-examination, the presentation of defense\r\nevidence, and closing argument.  Since the court's jury\r\ninstructions addressed the identification issue three times,\r\nOrtiz-Miranda's \"ability to effectively present\" the\r\nidentification defense was not \"seriously impaired.\"  Angiulo \r\n897 F.2d at 1205-06.\r\nVIII.  Failure to Disclose and Newly-Discovered Evidence \r\nOrtiz-Miranda argues that the government's failure to disclose\r\nduring trial its knowledge of Rivera-Melndez's whereabouts, his\r\npossession of a green motorcycle, his involvement in certain\r\ncriminal activity, and his association with the alias \"Cano\r\nBeeper\" in POPR records, constituted a due process violation\r\nwarranting reversal pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83\r\n(1972), and Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419 (1995).  Ortiz-Miranda\r\nalso argues that newly discovered evidence from a witness who\r\nbegan cooperating after conclusion of the trial independently and\r\ncumulatively mandates a new trial.  Ortiz-Miranda's claims fail\r\nbecause, as the district court correctly concluded, there is no\r\n\"reasonable probability\" that disclosure of the Brady material\r\nduring trial would have resulted in Ortiz-Miranda's acquittal. \r\nSee  Gilday v. Callahan, 59 F.3d 257, 267 (1st Cir. 1995), cert.\r\ndenied, 516 U.S. 1175 (1996).  Nor, as the district court\r\nconcluded, does the combination of the Brady material and newly-\r\ndiscovered evidence create such a \"reasonable probability.\"\r\nOrtiz-Miranda's motion for a new trial does not specifically cite\r\nthe failure to disclose Rivera-Melndez's location as grounds for\r\nrelief.  Rather, his counsel placed this information in an\r\n\"Affirmation\" appended to the motion. Thus, although the district\r\ncourt heard evidence on this issue at the hearing, it did not\r\nspecifically consider it in the Brady analysis.  The draft search\r\nwarrant affidavit did not contain information about the sighting\r\nof Rivera-Melndez because that event did not occur until after\r\nthe prosecutor had declined to authorize Rivera-Melndez's\r\narrest.  In its analysis of the draft affidavit, however, the\r\ndistrict court assumed the availability of Rivera-Melndez and\r\ndetermined that such availability would not have created a\r\nreasonable probability of Ortiz-Miranda's acquittal.  First, the\r\ncourt found it improbable that Rivera-Melndez would exculpate\r\nOrtiz-Miranda by implicating himself.  See United States v.\r\nOrtiz-Miranda, 931 F. Supp. 85, 93 (D.P.R. 1996).  Furthermore,\r\nthe court found it improbable that Garca-Otero would recant her\r\nidentification of Ortiz-Miranda or her failure to identify\r\nRivera-Melndez even if the defense produced Rivera-Melndez. \r\nSee id.\r\nOrtiz-Miranda does not elaborate on how Rivera-Melndez's \"very\r\npresence in court,\" Defendant's Br. at 35-36, would otherwise\r\nhave created a reasonable probability of acquittal.  Such a claim\r\nis especially questionable because the jury already had the\r\nbenefit of comparing photographs of the two men when assessing\r\nthe accuracy of Garca-Otero's identification of Ortiz-Miranda. \r\nThe government, while conceding the possibility that Rivera-\r\nMelndez could also be involved with Israel Santiago-Lugo's\r\norganization, reasonably argued in closing arguments that the\r\ntestimony of Garca-Otero and other evidence nonetheless\r\nestablished the guilt of Ortiz-Miranda.\r\nWith respect to the draft probable cause affidavit itself, the\r\ndistrict court determined that it \"favor[ed]\" the\r\nmisidentification claim insofar as it did not contradict the\r\nDepartment of Transportation information about the green\r\nmotorcycle and suggested Rivera-Melndez's involvement in drug\r\ntrafficking.  It did not, however, exculpate Ortiz-Miranda.  SeeOrtiz-Miranda, 931 F. Supp. at 92-93.  Similarly, the district\r\ncourt correctly recognized that although the missing page of the\r\ncriminal history report would have \"favored\" the defense by\r\nattributing the alias \"Cano Beeper\" solely to Rivera-Melndez,\r\nthe government perhaps could have established that the POPR\r\ndatabase was incomplete. See id. at 93.\r\nAs the district court recognized, it is the \"reasonable\r\nprobability\" standard that distinguishes merely \"favorable\"\r\nevidence from \"material\" evidence, the intentional or\r\nunintentional withholding of which violates a defendant's due\r\nprocess rights.  See Gilday, 59 F.3d at 267.  On this record, we\r\nagree with the district court that \"the sum of evidence withheld\r\nis hardly of the variety that would undermine our confidence in\r\nthe outcome of the trial.\"  Ortiz-Miranda, 931 F. Supp. at 94.\r\nFinally, Ortiz-Miranda summarily asserts \"prosecutorial\r\nmisconduct\" as grounds for reversal.  In view of the fact that he\r\nneither develops this argument nor cites any supporting\r\nauthority, we reject this argument out of hand.  See United\r\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[A] litigant\r\nhas an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely or\r\ndistinctly, or else forever hold its peace.\").\r\nIX.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nFirst, with respect to Count 46, conspiracy to possess cocaine\r\nand other controlled substances with the intent to distribute,\r\nMoiss Candelaria-Silva argues that the evidence was insufficient\r\nbecause the POPR investigation that led to the seizure did not\r\nlink him to the Sabana Seca residence where the seizure occurred. \r\nThis claim fails because to obtain a conviction, the\r\ninvestigative officers need not identify all the perpetrators\r\nprior to arrest.  Here, the testimony of Otero-Coln about the\r\nCandelaria-Silva family's use of the Sabana Seca residences to\r\nprocess cocaine and other drugs for distribution well supported\r\nthe jury's verdict as to his involvement in the conduct charged\r\nin Count 46.\r\nSecond, Rosado-Rosado and Moiss Candelaria-Silva argue that the\r\nevidence established the existence of separate conspiracies.  We\r\nfind their argument to be without merit.\r\nThe evidence presented at trial established that there was an\r\noverarching conspiracy headed by Israel Santiago-Lugo to\r\ndistribute controlled substances, including heroin, cocaine, and\r\nmarijuana.  The drugs were distributed at various places and by\r\nvarious people, including members of the Candelaria family.  As\r\nnoted in United States v. Wihbey, \"[t]he question whether a given\r\nbody of evidence is indicative of a single conspiracy, multiple\r\nconspiracies, or no conspiracy at all is ordinarily a matter of\r\nfact; a jury's determination in that regard is subject to review\r\nonly for evidentiary sufficiency.\"  75 F.3d 761, 774 (1st Cir.\r\n1996) (citing United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 732 (1st\r\nCir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 989 (1991)).\r\nHere the trial court expressly charged the jury on the multiple\r\nconspiracy defense:\r\n     You must decide whether the conspiracy charged in the indictment\r\n     existed and, if it did, who at least some of its members were. \r\n     If you find that the conspiracy charged did not exist, then you\r\n     must return a not guilty verdict, even though you may find that\r\n     some other conspiracy existed.  Similarly, if you find that any\r\n     defendant was not a member of the charged conspiracy, then you\r\n     must find that defendant not guilty, even though that defendant\r\n     may have been a member of some other conspiracy.\r\n\n12/1/95 Tr. at 4569-70.  Thus, the jury verdict can be viewed as\r\na rejection of the multiple conspiracy claim.  Wihbey, 75 F.3d at\r\n775 n.8 (stating that when the district court gives a multiple\r\nconspiracy instruction, a guilty verdict \"can be seen as an\r\neffective rejection of the multiple conspiracy theory\"). \r\nAs noted in United States v. Twitty, 72 F.3d 228 (1st Cir. 1995),\r\nthe arguments made by the defendant-appellants are not uncommon:\r\n     Twitty's argument is a common one in conspiracy appeals. \r\n     Whenever a conspiracy involves successive transactions and\r\n     multiple players, it is usually possible to slice the enterprise\r\n     into discrete portions.  Even a single conspiracy is likely to\r\n     involve subsidiary agreements relating to different individuals\r\n     and transactions.  And more often than not, none of the\r\n     agreements is explicit;  agreement is inferred from conduct;  and\r\n     the conceptual tests used to distinguish between one conspiracy\r\n     and many are not sharp edged.  See, e.g., United States v.\r\n     Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 17 (1st Cir.1984).\r\n\nId. at 231 (emphasis supplied).\r\nIn Wihbey, this Court, quoting United States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d\r\n855, 858 (1st Cir. 1987), set forth the framework for analyzing a\r\nclaim that the evidence was insufficient to allow the jury to\r\nfind a single conspiracy and that, instead, the evidence showed\r\ntwo separate conspiracies:\r\n\n     (1) Is the evidence sufficient to permit a jury to find the\r\n     (express or tacit) agreement that the indictment charges?  (2) If\r\n     not, is it sufficient to permit a jury, under a proper set of\r\n     instructions, to convict the defendant of a related, similar\r\n     conspiracy?  (3) If so [i.e., the answer to (2) is yes], does the\r\n     variance affect the defendant's substantial rights or does the\r\n     difference between the charged conspiracy and the conspiracy\r\n     proved amount to \"harmless error?\"\r\n\n75 F.3d at 773.  \"Put differently, so long as the statutory\r\nviolation remains the same, the jury can convict even if the\r\nfacts are somewhat different than charged -- so long as the\r\ndifference does not cause unfair prejudice.\"  Id. (internal\r\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\r\nAnalyzing this case under the first prong of the Glenn test, the\r\nevidence is clearly sufficient to permit a jury to find that\r\nappellants Rosado-Rosado and Moiss Candelaria-Silva joined the\r\noverarching conspiracy charged in Count I.  Assuming arguendo, as\r\nin Wihbey, that there was insufficient proof that appellants\r\nRosado-Rosado and Moiss Candelaria-Silva were members of the\r\noverarching conspiracy alleged in Count I, still, the second\r\nprong of the Glenn test would be answered in the affirmative. \r\nFor example, Moiss Candelaria-Silva largely concedes that the\r\nevidence was sufficient to convict him of the statutory offense\r\ncharged in Count I -- engaging in a conspiracy in violation of 21\r\nU.S.C. 846.  Likewise, appellant Rosado-Rosado states:  \"It is\r\nthe contention of . . . appellant that the overt acts for which\r\nevidence was presented against him relate -- if at all [--] to\r\nseparate and distinct drug operation or conspiracy.\"  Defendant's\r\nBr. at 8. Regardless of this assertion, however, both Otero-Coln\r\nand Garca-Otero testified as to their involvement in a\r\nconspiracy with him.\r\nSince the second prong of the Glenn test is answered in the\r\naffirmative, to obtain a reversal, appellants must meet their\r\nburden under the third prong of the Glenn test -- that as a\r\nresult of the variance, they were unfairly prejudiced.  SeeWihbey, 75 F.3d at 773.  In Wihbey, the Court noted that there\r\nwere at least three ways in which such a variance might prejudice\r\nthe accused.  First, a defendant may receive inadequate notice of\r\nthe charge against him and thus is taken by surprise at trial. \r\nSecond, a defendant may be twice subject to prosecution for the\r\nsame offense.  Third, a defendant may be prejudiced by\r\n\"evidentiary spillover\"--the \"transference of guilt\" to a\r\ndefendant involved in one conspiracy from evidence incriminating\r\ndefendants in another conspiracy in which the particular\r\ndefendant was not involved.  See id. at 774.\r\nLike the appellants in Wihbey, the appellants here have failed to\r\ncarry their burden of establishing unfair prejudice.  Appellants\r\nhave clearly failed to establish the applicable test with respect\r\nto a claim of prejudicial spillover -- \"prejudice so pervasive\r\nthat a miscarriage of justice looms.\"  Id. at 776 (internal\r\nquotation marks and citation omitted).  Here, the jury clearly\r\nassessed the evidence against each defendant separately.  This is\r\ndemonstrated by the fact that the jury declined to reach any\r\nverdict as to defendant Andrades-Marrero.  See 12/13/95 Tr. at\r\n5093.  Thus, appellants have not established unfair prejudice.\r\nAccordingly, defendant-appellant's \"multiple conspiracy\" argument\r\nis rejected.\r\nX.  Factual Findings at Sentencing\r\nA.  Ortiz-Miranda\r\nIn challenging his sentence, Ortiz-Miranda argues that the\r\ndistrict court erroneously attributed 1.5 kilograms of cocaine\r\nbase to him based upon extrapolating from an \"average\" dosage\r\namount.  Upon review, we conclude that the record supports the\r\ndistrict court's determination.\r\nThe district court properly considered testimony concerning at\r\nleast ten total cocaine base deliveries directly involving Ortiz-\r\nMiranda at the puntos in Arecibo and Vega Baja.  This estimate\r\nwas based upon the trial testimony of Garca-Otero and testimony\r\nat the hearing on the motion for a new trial.  In addition,\r\nOrtiz-Miranda had been arrested at the Arecibo location with\r\napproximately 596 capsules of cocaine base in July 1994, and\r\nOrtiz-Bez had been arrested near there in 1995 with over 1200\r\ncapsules containing a total amount of 196 grams of cocaine base.  \r\nGarca-Otero testified that at least 500 capsules of cocaine base\r\nwere distributed on a weekly basis in Vega Baja, and that Ortiz-\r\nMiranda made approximately six deliveries.  Thus, a conservative\r\nestimate of Ortiz-Miranda's direct involvement with 6,000\r\ncapsules at the two locations would yield one kilogram of cocaine\r\nbase and a higher weight of the total mixture containing it, the\r\ncapsules.  See  USCG  2D1.1(c)*(A) (\"weight of a controlled\r\nsubstance . . . refers to the weight of any mixture or substance\r\ncontaining [it]\").  In addition, the district court could\r\nreasonably infer that the additional deliveries of at least 3,000\r\ncapsules, yielding approximately another one-half kilogram of\r\ncocaine base to the Arecibo location would have been reasonably\r\nforeseeable to Ortiz-Miranda as part of the conspiracy.  Here,\r\neven using a conservative estimate, the district court properly\r\nattributed 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base to Ortiz-Miranda.\r\nB.  Eulalio Candelaria-Silva\r\nEulalio Candelaria-Silva argues that, because the firearms seized\r\nfrom the Sabana Seca buildings were \"out of reach,\" not used, and\r\nnot definitively linked to him, the district court erred in\r\nimposing the two-level increase to his guidelines offense level\r\npursuant to USCG  2D1.1(b)(1).  However, at sentencing,\r\nCandelaria failed to challenge the link between himself and the\r\nfirearms.  As a result, we reject his claim.  See Barnett, 989\r\nF.2d at 554 (\"raise-or-waive\" rule not relaxed where evidence\r\nsupports sentencing findings).\r\nAt sentencing, the district court correctly rejected Candelaria's\r\nclaim that a relationship between the drugs and the firearms was\r\n\"clearly improbable.\"  4/19/96 Tr. at 12.  Specifically, the\r\ndistrict court determined that \"in the context of the evidence .\r\n. . there [was] no doubt . . . that the weapons . . . had a\r\ndefinite, clear connection with drug trafficking.\"  Id. at 13-14. \r\nThe court stated further:\r\n     [T]hese were not hunting weapons.  These were not a collection of\r\n     weapons.  This was not a weapon had, like many people do, to just\r\n     defend their home in the event some burglar comes in . . .These\r\n     were loaded AK-47s and Ar-15s, we're talking about assault\r\n     rifles.\r\n\nId.  After reviewing the record, we uphold the district court's\r\ndetermination.\r\nC.  Ortiz-Bez\r\nAt sentencing, Ortiz-Bez acknowledged his involvement as a core\r\nmember of the conspiracy.  Specifically, he acknowledged working\r\nat the \"table\" in Isla Verde and going \"out hunting for people to\r\nkill them [during the drug war with the Rosarios].\"  Defendant's\r\nApp. at 58.  In fact, his candor so impressed the judge that the\r\njudge adjusted his offense level for acceptance of\r\nresponsibility.  See Ortiz-Bez Sentencing Findings at 2.\r\nOrtiz-Bez now maintains, however, that the sentence imposed was\r\n\"exaggeratedly harsh,\" and alleges that the government was\r\nretaliatory in seeking a three-level, as opposed to two-level,\r\nadjustment, pursuant to USCG  3B1.1(b), for his role in the\r\noffense.  Contrary to his assertions, however, the record\r\nreflects that, because Ortiz-Bez's relevant conduct clearly\r\ninvolved five or more participants, he is not eligible for the\r\nmere two-level adjustment pursuant to USCG  3B1.1(c).  Thus, the\r\ndistrict court did not clearly err.\r\nD.  Reyes-Padilla and Morales-Santiago\r\n\nReyes-Padilla argues that the district court should have imposed\r\na lower sentence because of her age, medical condition and\r\nrehabilitative efforts.  See Defendant's Br. at 10-11.  At\r\nsentencing, however, she raised none of these claims, preferring\r\ninstead to argue that she had withdrawn from the conspiracy after\r\nthe 1989 execution of search warrants at her Virgilio Dvila\r\napartment.  See Defendant's App. at 66-79.  Notwithstanding this\r\nwaiver, age and health are not ordinarily relevant sentencing\r\nfactors, see USCG  5H1.1 &amp; 5H1.4, and Reyes-Padilla makes no\r\nargument that age and health in this case constitute a\r\n\"mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not\r\nadequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing\r\nCommission.\" USCG  5K2.0.  Furthermore, her rehabilitation claim\r\nis belied by the fact that, at sentencing, she refused to\r\nacknowledge participation in the conspiracy after 1989.  SeeDefendant's App. at 71.  The record supports the sentence\r\nimposed.\r\nMorales-Santiago also argues that the district court erred in\r\ndetermining her relevant conduct, pursuant to USCG  2D1.1, and\r\nin denying her an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility,\r\npursuant to USCG  3E1.1.  See Defendant's Br. at 7-8.  Although\r\nMorales-Santiago has provided no transcript of the sentencing\r\nproceedings, the available record supports the district court's\r\ndetermination.  The record reflects that, during at least part of\r\nthe conspiracy, Morales-Santiago was charged with storing large\r\nquantities of controlled substances, directly providing Israel\r\nSantiago's distributors with those controlled substances,\r\ncollecting proceeds, and maintaining accounting records.  As\r\nsuch, the expansiveness of the distribution conspiracy was\r\nreasonably foreseeable to her even though she may not have\r\nparticipated in every transaction.  Furthermore, contrary to\r\nMorales-Santiago's assertions, the Presentence Report (\"PSR\") at\r\n30-31 does reflect a \"thorough explanation of her participation\r\nin the case at hand\" when viewed in the context of the trial\r\ntestimony of Hidalgo and Otero-Coln.  Thus, Morales-Santiago's\r\nclaim has no merit.\r\nXI.  Forfeiture of the Montaez Property\r\nReyes-Padilla makes six separate objections to the inclusion of\r\nthe Montaez Property in the Final Order of Forfeiture:  (1) that\r\nthere was no evidence that the property was traceable to drug\r\nproceeds; (2) that she was denied the opportunity to have the\r\nforfeiture determined by a jury; (3) that there was no principal\r\nasset for which the Montaez property could properly be\r\nsubstituted; (4) that forfeiture of the property constitutes\r\ndouble jeopardy; (5) that the government waived its right to\r\nforfeit the property as a substitute asset when it withdrew it\r\nfrom Count 49; and (6) that her joint and several liability for\r\nthe full amount realized by the conspiracy violates the Excessive\r\nFines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.  None of Reyes-Padilla's\r\narguments is compelling.\r\nA.  Forfeiture of a Substitute Asset\r\nA criminal forfeiture order may take several forms.  First, the\r\ngovernment is entitled to an in personam judgment against the\r\ndefendant for the amount of money the defendant obtained as\r\nproceeds of the offense.  Second, to the extent the government\r\ncan trace any of the proceeds to specific assets, it may seek the\r\nforfeiture of those assets directly pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \r\n853(a)(1).  Third, if as a result of some act or omission of the\r\ndefendant, the government cannot trace the proceeds to specific\r\nassets, it may seek the forfeiture of \"any property, cash or\r\nmerchandise, in satisfaction of the amount of criminal forfeiture\r\nto which it is entitled.\"  United States v. Voight, 89 F.3d 1050,\r\n1088 (3d Cir. 1996); see 21 U.S.C.  853(p) (authorizing\r\nforfeiture of substitute assets).\r\nIn Voight, the Third Circuit held that a defendant convicted of\r\nlaundering $1.6 million was required to forfeit that amount as a\r\nmoney judgment.  See 89 F.3d at 1084.  When the government could\r\nnot directly trace any forfeitable proceeds to the defendant's\r\ncurrent assets, the court held that the government could satisfy\r\nthe $1.6 million judgment by seeking forfeiture of the\r\ndefendant's assets as substitute assets.  See id. at 1088.\r\nSimilarly, in this case, the district court ordered forfeiture of\r\nthe Montaez property as a substitute asset to satisfy, at least\r\nin part, the $6,000,000 money judgment set forth in the\r\npreliminary order of forfeiture because the government\r\nestablished that it could not trace any of the criminal proceeds\r\ninto any of the defendant's current assets.\r\nIn this context, failure to establish any nexus between the\r\nMONTAEZ property and the conspiracy is irrelevant.  In fact,\r\nsuch a nexus would render forfeiture of the property as a\r\nsubstitute asset unnecessary.  See Voight, 89 F.3d at 1086\r\n(\"[t]he substitute asset provision comes into play only when\r\nforfeitable property cannot be identified as directly 'involved\r\nin' or 'traceable to' [the criminal activity]\").\r\nTo obtain an order forfeiting property as a substitute asset, the\r\ngovernment need only comply with the requirements of    853(p). \r\nIn particular, substitute assets may be forfeited if the\r\ngovernment shows that, as a result of any act or omission of the\r\ndefendant, the forfeitable property \"(1) cannot be located upon\r\nthe exercise of due diligence; [or] (2) has been transferred or\r\nsold to, or deposited with, a third party.\"   853(p)(1) &amp; (2). \r\nHere, the government complied with  853(p) by submitting a\r\nmotion and affidavit that recited the efforts the government had\r\nmade to locate the proceeds of the drug conspiracy that would\r\nhave been directly forfeitable under  853(a).  See Defendant's\r\nApp. at 121-24 (Affidavit of Special Agent Felicia Ramos-Andino). \r\nThe affidavit concluded that Reyes-Padilla had \"dissipated or\r\notherwise disposed of the proceeds of her drug trafficking,\" id.at 123, so that the proceeds could not, despite the exercise of\r\ndue diligence, be located.  See id. at 123-24.  Based on this\r\nrecord, it was not error for the district court to order the\r\nforfeiture of \"other property of the defendant,\"  853(p), up to\r\nthe amount described in the money judgment. See  853(p);  United\r\nStates v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1995) (affirming\r\nforfeiture of substitute assets under identical provision in 18\r\nU.S.C.  1963(m)).\r\nB.  Determination of Assets\r\nReyes-Padilla contends that she was denied the right to have the\r\njury determine whether the Montaez Property could be forfeited. \r\nShe also asserts that there was no \"principal asset\" for which\r\nthe Montaez Property could properly be substituted. \r\nThe forfeiture of substitute assets is a matter left solely to\r\nthe court.  See Hurley, 63 F.3d at 23 (\"the statute says that an\r\norder substituting assets is to be made by 'the court'\").  As\r\nthis Court explained in Hurley, the defendant has a right to have\r\nthe amount subject to forfeiture determined, in the first\r\ninstance, by the jury.  See 68 F.3d at 23; see also Fed. R. Crim.\r\nP. 31(e) (stating that the initial forfeiture is sought in the\r\nindictment and is specified in a special verdict).  But the jury\r\nhas no role in determining, subsequently, whether the property\r\nhas been dissipated and whether the government is thereby\r\nentitled to seek the forfeiture of substitute assets.  \"Indeed,\r\nthe government might not even know that substitution is necessary\r\nuntil it seeks to take possession of the property specified in\r\nthe initial forfeiture order.\"  Hurley, 68 F.3d at 23.\r\nIn this case, the jury determined -- by rendering the special\r\nverdict -- that the conspiracy realized $6,000,000 in proceeds\r\nfrom the commission of the specified offenses, and that the\r\ndefendant and others were jointly and severally liable for that\r\namount.  Thus, the jury determined that the $6,000,000 was the\r\n\"principal asset\" subject to forfeiture.  In having the jury\r\ndetermine that amount, the defendant was afforded all of the\r\nprocedural protections regarding the determination of the\r\nforfeiture by the jury to which she was entitled.\r\nC.  Double Jeopardy and Waiver\r\nThere is no merit whatsoever in Reyes-Padilla's contention that\r\nshe was subject to double jeopardy because the government\r\ncommenced its case with a civil seizure, but concluded it by\r\nproceeding under the substitute assets provision of the criminal\r\nforfeiture statute.  Nor did the government's initial inclusion,\r\nand subsequent dismissal, of the Montaez property from Counts 48\r\nand 49 of the Superseding Indictment constitute a waiver of the\r\nright to seek forfeiture of the property as a substitute asset.\r\nA completed civil forfeiture of property does not constitute\r\n\"jeopardy\" under the Double Jeopardy Clause, and does not bar the\r\nsubsequent criminal prosecution and punishment of the defendant\r\nwhose property was forfeited.  See United States v. Ursery, 518\r\nU.S. 267, 274 (1996) (stating that the Supreme Court has\r\nconsistently concluded that \"the Clause does not apply to [civil\r\nforfeitures] because they do not impose punishment\").  A\r\nfortiori, a civil forfeiture action that goes no further than a\r\nseizure, and never results in the entry of any civil forfeiture\r\njudgment cannot constitute jeopardy.  Moreover, this Court has\r\nrecognized that it is \"perfectly proper\" to begin a forfeiture\r\naction with a civil seizure, and then to convert the action to a\r\ncriminal forfeiture once an indictment is returned.  See United\r\nStates v. Kingsley, 851 F.2d 16, 18 &amp; n.1 (1st Cir. 1988). \r\nIndeed, that procedure is commonplace.\r\nNor is it uncommon for the government to shift theories of\r\ncriminal forfeiture -- from direct forfeiture to substitute\r\nassets -- upon return of an indictment.  We held in Voight that\r\nwhen the government's attempt to forfeit the defendant's property\r\ndirectly was unsuccessful, the remedy was for the government to\r\nseek forfeiture of the same property as a substitute asset under \r\n853(p).  See Voight, 89 F.3d at 1088.  If, as Voightillustrates, it is proper to seek the forfeiture of property as a\r\nsubstitute asset even after a jury has rejected the government's\r\nattempt to forfeit the property directly, then there is no error\r\nin allowing the government to dismiss the property from the\r\nforfeiture allegation before it goes to the jury and to seek the\r\nforfeiture as a substitute asset after trial.  In dismissing the\r\nMontaez property from the forfeiture allegation in Count 49, the\r\ngovernment simply shifted its theory of forfeiture from  853(a)\r\nto  853(p).  Doing so before submission of the case to the jury\r\nwas entirely proper in light of the prosecutor's conclusion that\r\nthere was insufficient evidence to support direct forfeiture\r\nunder  853(a).\r\nD.  Excessive Fines Clause \r\nIt is well-established that criminal defendants are jointly and\r\nseverally liable for forfeiture of the full amount of the\r\nproceeds of their criminal offense, and that the imposition of\r\nsuch a forfeiture judgment does not constitute an\r\nunconstitutionally excessive fine.  See Hurley, 63 F.3d at 23\r\n(\"the government can collect [the amount subject to forfeiture]\r\nonly once but, subject to that cap, it can collect from any\r\nappellant so much of that amount as was foreseeable to that\r\nappellant\"); see also  United States v. Simmons, 154 F.3d 765,\r\n769-70 (8th Cir. 1998) (holding that each defendant is jointly\r\nand severally liable for all foreseeable proceeds of the scheme\r\nand that \"the government is not required to prove the specific\r\nportion of proceeds for which each defendant is responsible\").\r\nIn Hurley, we affirmed precisely the action taken here: the\r\nimposition of an order substituting other property of each\r\ndefendant up to the value of the criminal proceeds for which the\r\ndefendant was jointly and severally liable.  In that case, each\r\nof the defendants, including the relatively minor participants,\r\nwas ordered to forfeit substitute assets up to approximately $140\r\nmillion in value.  If holding each defendant jointly and\r\nseverally liable to forfeit that amount in substitute assets did\r\nnot violate the Excessive Fines Clause, then the forfeiture\r\nimposed on Reyes-Padilla does not.  \r\nIt is true, as Reyes-Padilla notes, that the Eighth Circuit has\r\nheld that holding a \"secondary figure\" jointly and severally\r\nliable for the forfeiture of the full amount of the criminal\r\nproceeds may constitute an excessive fine if the defendant\r\n\"reaped little benefit\" from the scheme.  See United States v.\r\nVan Brocklin, 115 F.3d 587, 602 (8th Cir. 1997).  Van Brocklindoes not aid the defendant.\r\nFirst, in Hurley, we upheld the imposition of a substitute assets\r\norder for the full amount of the criminal proceeds against\r\nrelatively low-level participants who reaped little personal\r\nbenefit from the criminal offense.  \r\nSecond, in its most recent opinion on the matter, the Eighth\r\nCircuit relied on Hurley to uphold a forfeiture order holding the\r\ndefendants jointly and severally liable for the full amount of\r\nthe proceeds of a bribery offense, whether or not a given\r\ndefendant received those funds personally.  See Simmons, 154 F.3d \r\nat 769.\r\nThird, it is appropriate to hold Reyes-Padilla accountable. \r\nAlthough the district court determined that she was a minor\r\nparticipant in the offense, she served as an important link\r\nbetween Israel Santiago-Lugo and his distributors at the various\r\nhousing projects.  Because she personally received and stored\r\ncontrolled substances at her apartment and at the apartment of\r\nMorales-Santiago, personally provided wholesale quantities of\r\ncontrolled substances to Santiago-Lugo's distributors, and also\r\nassisted with maintaining records of these transactions, she is\r\nappropriately characterized as being \"in charge of Santiago\r\nLugo's drug trafficking business at the Virgilio Dvila Housing\r\nProject in Bayamn.\"  Defendant's App. at 121 (Affidavit of\r\nSpecial Agent Felicia Ramos-Andino). Reyes-Padilla was at\r\nMorales-Santiago's apartment when POPR officers seized\r\napproximately $96,000 in currency and the drug ledgers reflecting\r\nover $3,000,000 worth of transactions during a one-year period. \r\nGiven Reyes-Padilla's role, holding her liable for the full\r\namount of the proceeds of the conspiracy falls well within the\r\nbounds we prescribed in Hurley.\r\nFinally, Reyes-Padilla does not challenge the $6,000,000 money\r\njudgment.  Rather, her appeal challenges only the forfeiture of\r\nthe Montaez property as a substitute asset.  The Montaez\r\nproperty has a value of only $169,000.  Reyes-Padilla cannot\r\nseriously argue that the forfeiture of property valued at that\r\namount is \"grossly disproportional\" to the gravity of a drug\r\nconspiracy that realized millions of dollars in proceeds.  See United States v. Bajakajian, 118 S. Ct. 2028, 2036 (1998)\r\n(holding that \"a punitive forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines\r\nClause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a\r\ndefendant's offense\").  Accordingly, the forfeiture of Reyes-\r\nPadilla's Montaez property does not violate the Excessive Fines\r\nClause of the United States Constitution.\r\n                      CONCLUSION\r\n    For the reasons stated in this opinion, we AFFIRM.\r\n",

Hidalgo pleaded guilty to Count One of the Superseding Indictment.  Otero-Coln and Garca-Otero received immunity from prosecution in exchange for their cooperation.  In addition, the government presented the testimony of numerous local police officers who executed search warrants or were otherwise involved in the investigation of the defendants and their co-conspirators.  The government also presented documentary and forensic evidence and testimony relating to firearms and drugs seized from the co-conspirators, and other pertinent evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The co-conspirator witnesses testified that Israel Santiago-Lugo (\"Santiago-Lugo\") operated several drug distribution points (\"puntos\") at various housing projects in the northern region of Puerto Rico.  With the assistance of his co-conspirators, Santiago-Lugo distributed vast quantities of controlled substances including:  (1) heroin sold under the name \"cristal\";  (2) cocaine sold under the names \"bolso rojo\" and \"rolito\";  (3) cocaine base;  and (4) marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Virgilio Davila Punto</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hidalgo testified that he, Ortiz-Baez, and Wilfredo and David Martnez-Matta began working for Santiago-Lugo's drug distribution ring sometime after Hidalgo moved to the Virgilio Davila housing project in 1990.  He also testified that Ortiz-Baez and others packaged drugs at two rented apartments in Isla Verde and transported the drugs to various puntos.  Hidalgo further testified that Reyes-Padilla, Santiago-Lugo's aunt, distributed drugs from a Virgilio Davila apartment used by Santiago-Lugo's grandparents.  From this apartment, Morales-Santiago supplied Santiago-Lugo's distributors with drugs, including heroin and cocaine, and maintained a ledger to account for the drugs and proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 1989, the Police of Puerto Rico (\"POPR\") executed a search warrant at Virgilio Davila building 43, apartment 411.  Reyes-Padilla was at the apartment with her parents.  The search yielded twenty-six grams of cocaine and three grams of heroin packaged in over 250 small bags.  Later, on October 17, 1989, the POPR executed a search warrant at the same apartment.  When an officer first arrived, a young man was selling a controlled substance through an iron grating on the apartment door.  When the officer identified himself, the man fled inside the apartment.  A search of the apartment yielded two grams of heroin, less than a gram of cocaine, and over $2000 in U.S. currency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, POPR officer Angel Nieves-Domnguez testified that, pursuant to a tip, he conducted surveillance of Reyes-Padilla at Virgilio Davila building 43, apartment 412 during the afternoon of October 1 and the morning of October 2, 1991.  On the first day, he observed Reyes-Padilla and Santiago-Lugo retrieve two large bags from the trunk of Santiago-Lugo's car.  Upon reaching the stairs to building 43, Santiago-Lugo opened one of the brown bags and pulled out several transparent plastic bags that each contained smaller red bags.  As Santiago-Lugo distributed the plastic bags to the persons assembled, Reyes-Padilla made notations in a notebook.  Additionally, upon receiving the packages, some recipients hid the packages in nearby garbage cans or bushes.  Reyes-Padilla took the other large brown bag up to apartment 412.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Santiago-Lugo left, the officer observed one individual--who had received a package from Santiago-Lugo--apparently selling some of the smaller red bags to a young woman near building 44.  Shortly thereafter, a young man arrived at apartment 412, and Reyes-Padilla sold the man a transparent bag appearing to contain heroin.  The next day, the officer saw Santiago-Lugo arrive and deliver yet another brown bag to Reyes-Padilla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that month, POPR executed a search warrant at apartment 412.  At that time, defendants Reyes-Padilla and Morales-Santiago were in the apartment.  The search yielded four \"decks\" of heroin in a Sucrets box, approximately $100,000 in U.S. currency, and two notebooks appearing to contain records of drug deliveries and debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, POPR officers observed Rosado-Rosado and a minor each engage in an apparent sale of controlled substances and give the proceeds from the sale to a heavy-set individual.  Rosado-Rosado retrieved the drugs from a brown paper bag in his back pants pocket.  When officers entered the housing project, Rosado-Rosado and the minor attempted to flee.  Officers caught Rosado-Rosado and seized eighteen aluminum foil packets containing heroin and five bags containing cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hidalgo testified at trial about the importance of the Virgilio Davila punto as a drug distribution site.  He stated that he personally received packages of cocaine and heroin from Morales-Santiago to distribute on behalf of Israel Santiago-Lugo, and that he observed distributors from Santiago-Lugo's other puntos arrive at Virgilio Davila and receive packages from Morales-Santiago.  He identified four pages of notebook entries under the name \"Batman\" from the notebook seized in October 1991 that pertained to his distribution of marijuana and cocaine at Virgilio Davila.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the entries in the notebook was one pertaining to fifty packets of heroin, referred to as \"C\" to correspond to \"cristal,\" and one pertaining to fifty packets of cocaine, referred to as \"R\" because of the brand name \"bolso rojo.\"   Expert testimony showed that the entries recorded transactions transpiring almost daily between October 29, 1990 and October 24, 1991.  The notebooks contained a \"price structure\" table which specified the prices of multiple units with a base price of $75 per unit.  A conservative estimate of the amount of drugs distributed would be close to 50,000 units having a total value of approximately $3.5 million dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Rosario Brothers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Hidalgo learned that Santiago-Lugo and the Rosario brothers had become adversaries.  Santiago-Lugo and the Rosarios previously had agreed to share control of the drug distribution punto at Virgilio Davila in Bayamn.  According to Hidalgo, the enmity between them stemmed from a drug debt owed to Santiago-Lugo by one of the Rosarios.  Tensions escalated in early 1993 when a Santiago debt collector and a Rosario associate were both murdered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1993, Hidalgo sustained a gunshot wound when an unknown assailant or assailants fired a barrage of bullets from a moving vehicle near Virgilio Davila.  After recuperating, Hidalgo again rejoined the conspiracy.  On December 1, 1993, Hidalgo, Ortiz-Baez, Santiago-Lugo, and co-conspirator Andres Coln-Miranda were arrested in Bayamn.  Ortiz-Baez, Hidalgo, and Coln-Miranda were in possession of firearms without proper permits.  Hidalgo testified that they were armed due to the ongoing tensions with the Rosario brothers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Los Murales Punto<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Otero-Coln testified that, sometime in 1988 or 1989, SantiagoLugo's brother Ral and Jorge Martnez-Rosado (\"Fobi\") reached an agreement with Jose Roman Freites (\"Josean\") for the distribution of cristal heroin at Los Murales.  Otero-Coln, who had served as a lookout for Josean for approximately two months, became a runner who picked up drugs from Virgilio Davila.  He testified that he began picking up fifty packages, each containing ten packets of heroin and costing $70.  Eventually, he would pick up as many as 100 packages every three of four days, each costing $75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Otero-Coln further testified that, after the POPR searched Reyes-Padilla's Virgilio Davila apartment, the distribution operation was moved to the apartment of Morales-Santiago, who also kept notebooks reflecting drug deliveries and debts.  He stated that Ortiz-Baez and others who worked at the \"table\" in Isla Verde were right-hand men for Santiago-Lugo.  These men would sometimes transport drugs to Los Murales when Otero-Coln could not.

Otero-Coln testified that he met the Candelaria-Silvas, including Moises and Luis, after Josean agreed with Santiago-Lugo to distribute cocaine at Los Murales in exchange for a reduction in the price of heroin distributed there.  Otero-Coln stated that he would obtain cocaine from Ral Santiago-Lugo at Virgilio Davila and transport the drugs to Eulalio and Moises' house in Manat for processing to sell at Los Murales and Villa Evangelina.  Eulalio Candelaria-Silva would pick up the proceeds from Otero-Coln.

On two occasions in 1990, an undercover police officer made controlled purchases of cocaine from Eulalio Candelaria-Silva at Villa Evangelina.  In addition, POPR officers executed search warrants at the Candelaria home in 1993 and February 1995.

Jury Selection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellants argue that the district court violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968 (\"the Act\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1861, Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b), and the Amended Plan for the Random Selection of Grand and Petit Jurors for the United States District Court for Puerto Rico (\"District Plan\") by ex parte eliminating jurors from the venire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Jury Selection Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act was enacted to ensure that potential jurors are selected at random from a representative cross-section of the community and that all qualified citizens have an opportunity to be considered for service.  See H.R.Rep. No. 1076 (1968), 1968 U.S. C.C.A.N. 1792.   The Act provides that each district court devise a \"local plan\" for the selection of jurors consistent with the objectives of randomness and nondiscrimination set forth in &#167;&#167; 1861 and 1862.  See &#167; 1863.  The local plan for the District of Puerto Rico was devised and approved pursuant to &#167; 1863.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act sets forth five specific reasons a summoned juror may be excused by the district court.  They are:  (1) undue hardship;  (2) inability to render impartial service;  (3) peremptory challenge;  (4) good cause shown;  and (5) a determination by the court that his service as a juror would be likely to threaten the secrecy of the proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect the integrity of the jury deliberations, that the exclusion is warranted, and that the exclusion is not inconsistent with other provisions of the Act.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1866(c).  Section 1866(c) provides that the court may only exclude a person under (5) in open court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Jury Orientation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of eighty prospective jurors in the panel for this case, only sixty-two appeared for jury orientation on the morning of September 13, 1995.  At the orientation, conducted on the record but outside the presence of counsel, the district court gave preliminary instructions regarding jury service and distributed the juror questionnaires.  He told the jurors nothing specific about the case except the docket number.  The judge then instructed the jurors not to discuss the case with anyone, spoke to them about the importance of jury service, and described the questionnaire.  The judge left the courtroom while the jurors viewed the video \"Justice by the People\" and completed the questionnaires.  Upon their completion of the questionnaires, the judge returned and excused the jurors for the day.  Because only fifty prospective jurors remained after the morning orientation session on September 13, the court summoned thirteen additional randomly selected prospective jurors from two other panels.  These prospective jurors, and one late-arriving member of the original panel, then received substantially the same information and instructions from the judge and completed the questionnaires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During jury selection the next day, it became clear to Ortiz-Miranda's counsel that some of the juror questionnaires were missing.  Upon raising the matter with the district court, the judge explained to counsel that the clerk had \"highlighted\" certain questionnaires as \"problematic,\" and he had \"dealt with those obvious cases.\"   9/14/95 Tr. at 126.  Ortiz-Miranda's counsel objected to the district court's actions on the ground that it \"involv[ed] and invok[ed] Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.\"  Id. The court overruled counsel's objections, but agreed to provide counsel with the questionnaire forms and invited counsel to further object after reviewing them if counsel found that the court had \"exercised the [sic] improper discretion,\" id., in excusing fourteen prospective jurors brought to his attention by the jury clerk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>a. Lack of Qualifications Dismissals</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to be deemed qualified to serve as a juror on a petit jury in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, an individual must be a citizen of the United States, eighteen years of age or older, have resided for a period of one year within the judicial district, and be \"able to read, write, speak, and understand the English language with a degree of proficiency sufficient to fill out satisfactorily the Juror Qualification Form and to render satisfactory jury service in this Court.\"   District Plan at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed six of the prospective jurors based on a lack of proficiency in English.  Juror 16 stated that she had difficulty reading or understanding English and answered the question asking her to describe her work in general terms in Spanish.  Juror 17 completed almost all of the questionnaire in Spanish.  Juror 18 indicated that she had difficulty with English and also wrote in Spanish that she did not hear well.  Juror 45 completed the forms entirely in Spanish.  Juror 61 indicated that he had trouble with English and did not give more than a one word response in English to any of the questions requiring more than a yes or no answer.  Finally, Juror 93 indicated that he had trouble reading or understanding English, but otherwise completed the questionnaire in English.  After examining these questionnaires, we hold that Judge Fuste did not err by dismissing these prospective jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Plan also mandates that \"[n]o person shall be qualified to serve ... if he is incapable, by reason of mental or physical infirmity, to render satisfactory jury service.\"  Id.  The district court excused two jurors for medical reasons.  Juror 13 answered \"No\" to the question, \"Do you have any physical problem (for example, sight, hearing or other medical condition) that would interfere with your ability to serve?\" but a note at the bottom of the form states \"Eye ongoing medical [illegible].\"  The government contends that this note was made by the district court, but the author's identity is unclear.  The district court did write on the beginning of the form:  \"See note [page] 3 claimed ongoing eye impediment.\"   Juror 89 stated that he had \"Fibrilosis Atrial\" and that he was currently taking daily medication.  The district court excused him on account of his health and because of his answer to question # 9.  Question # 9 asked the degree of education the prospective juror had achieved.  Juror 89 had a law degree, but was retired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Although the district court's actions, with respect to these two jurors, were questionable in that Juror 13 did not state that his medical condition would interfere with his serving as a juror and Juror 89 was dismissed in part because he holds a law degree, there was at least some medical reason why both jurors could have been excused.  Accordingly, these excusals were not an abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Contreras, 108 F.3d 1255, 1269 (10th Cir.1997) (applying abuse of discretion standard to pre voir dire excusals).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>b. Undue Hardship Dismissals</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both &#167; 1866 and the District Plan permit the district court to excuse prospective jurors prior to voir dire on the ground of \"undue hardship.\"   Here, the district court excused six jurors on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the district court's notes, Juror 3 was excused because he was the only person at his office.  Juror 3 stated that he \"was the only representative of the company in Puerto Rico.  I sell generic medicine to Drug [sic] stores and Hospitals [sic] in P.R[.] My Job [sic] is mostly done by telemarketing for which I can not be away from my work for too long.  I m[sic] training a part time employee to assist me due the [sic] increase in sales.\"   The district court excused Juror 32 because she was taking care of her mother, who was in the hospital, and her grandmother, who was at home.  Although she was the \"only one\" who could help them, she stated that she would \"be very proud to participate as a juror ... and to let [her] know what [she] should do.\"   According to his notes, Judge Fuste excused Juror 70 because he was a night shift medical technician at Fajardo Hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jurors 35, 63, and 72 indicated that they had various business and personal travel plans that would conflict with the trial.  Juror 35 stated that she would be traveling during the trial to a \"Consumers Affairs annual meeting\" and then \"intend[ed] to take my vacations.\"   Juror 63 was excused by the district court on account of a pre-arranged vacation.  During the trial, she was scheduled to attend a training session and to leave with her family on a previously planned vacation.  Finally, Juror 72 was excused because he had a reservation to go to Nevada and California for a month during the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Jurors 3 and 32, but did impermissibly excuse Jurors 70, 35, 63, and 72.  With regard to Jurors 3 and 32, their questionnaires document that acting as Jurors would work an undue hardship.  However, the same cannot be said for the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to Juror 70, we note that under the District Plan, he could have requested to be excused from jury duty.  The District Plan states that jury service by medical laboratory technicians would entail undue hardship or extreme inconvenience, and such an individual \"shall be excused from jury service upon individual request.\"   District Plan at 5 (emphasis added).  However, Juror 70 did not request to be excused or object to being a juror.  The choice not to serve on the jury at this stage was his and not the court's.  The district court acted improperly in unilaterally excusing him from jury service.  We cannot be sure whether Juror 70 desired to serve or was unaware of the District Plan's provision.  Regardless of his desire or knowledge, however, there was no prima facie reason for him to have been dismissed from the pool at this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting with respect to Jurors 35, 63, and 72 that the district court incorrectly described their situation to counsel the next morning at jury selection.  The district court stated:  \"What else was there?   And people with paid vacations, which they so said in a note, Judge, I'm leaving on such and such a date.  How can I detain those people?\"   9/14/95 Tr. at 127.  After a very close and careful reading of the questionnaires, we did not find any notes on them stating that any of these jurors had paid vacations.  If such a statement was made by any of the jurors to the district court, it was not recorded by the Judge on the questionnaires in the record.  Jurors 35 \"intend[ed]\" to take vacations.  For Juror 63, \"everything was set.\"   Finally, Juror 72 had a \"reservation.\"   It appears that the district court interpreted those phrases to mean paid non-refundable, non-changeable tickets although those phrases may well not have meant that at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury duty works a burden on all called to serve.  There are instances in which previously-made travel plans would cause jury service to become an undue hardship.  However, the district court all too willingly accepted the proposed excuses of these jurors without allowing the parties to examine the prospective jurors in voir dire.  Exclusions at this stage approach a ministerial function, which is why &#167; 1866 authorizes the clerk of the court under the supervision of the district court--if the District Plan so authorizes--to excuse such jurors.  See &#167; 1866(c).  If jurors are excused as a result of a non-ministerial exercise of discretion better left to voir dire itself, as occurred here, the prospects for the defendant obtaining a fair cross-section of the community could be improperly diminished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, we think it unwise for district judges to engage in ex parte voir dire beyond purely ministerial functions.  Ministerial functions permitted by the Plan and Act are usually performed by the clerk, under supervision of the court.  If a judge does no more than what a jury clerk is authorized to do in excusing jurors, that may raise an issue of allocation of court resources but does not raise an issue of impropriety.  See United States v. Calaway, 524 F.2d 609, 616 (9th Cir.1975).  When the court, in the absence of counsel, starts questioning jurors and excusing them based on responses which go beyond basic information about qualifications, obvious bias, or hardship, it is all too easy to slip over the line, as happened here.  Whether slipping over the line deprives a defendant of statutory or constitutional rights is another question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. The Remedy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having established that certain of the exclusions were not justified under the Act, we turn to the question of whether the Act provides appellants with a remedy.  By its terms, the Act only provides a remedy--the stay of proceedings pending the selection of a petit jury in conformity with the Act--for substantial failures to comply with its provisions.  See &#167; 1867(d);  United States v. Calabrese, 942 F.2d 218, 226 (3d Cir.1991).  In order to obtain this remedy, a party challenging the jury selection process under the Act must make his challenge \"before the voir dire examination begins, or within seven days after the defendant discovered or could have discovered, by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is earlier.\" &#167; 1867(a).  The timeliness requirement \"is to be strictly construed, and failure to comply precisely with its terms forecloses a challenge under the Act.\"  United States v. Paradies, 98 F.3d 1266, 1277 (11th Cir.1996) (citation omitted).  \"[O]nce voir dire begins, Jury Selection Act challenges are barred, even where the grounds for the challenge are discovered only later.\"  Id. at 1278 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).  The Act requires that any motion filed be accompanied by a \"sworn statement of facts which, if true, would constitute a substantial failure to comply with provisions of [the Act].\" &#167; 1867(d).  When that requirement is not satisfied, the challenge to the selection process must fail, because \"Congress left no room for ad hoc review of the usefulness of compliance with [the sworn statement] requirement.\"  Paradies, 98 F.3d at 1278 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda's counsel objected after the district court gave counsel the list of the remaining prospective jurors and his instructions for making challenges.  She stated the reasons for her objection and the district court took notice.  See 9/14/95 Tr. at 129.  Counsel next asked if the transcript was available.  See id.   The court stated:  \"The transcript is not available.\"  Id. Counsel next asked for a continuance, which was denied.  See id.   But, the district court told counsel that she \"can examine the forms\" and that there would be \"an accounting made by the jury clerk,\" id. at 129-30, but that it would not be done \"now,\" id. at 130, because there was \"[n]o need to do that now.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With a transcript of the above events, it would seem that there would be no quarrel as to what occurred.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  In a Memorandum Order dated August 11, 1998, the district court took issue with Ortiz-Miranda's brief, stating:  \"Contrary to what is stated in the brief on appeal, counsel for all defendants, as well as trial attorneys for the Department of Justice, were given copies of [the original questionnaires of those excused] before jury selection commenced in the case now on appeal.\"   8/11/98 Memorandum Order at 1 (emphasis added).  He continued:  \"The preparation of the photocopies and sets of documents were turned over to counsel before jury selection was supervised ... and I made certain that all attorneys of record received a set of the pertinent documents so that they could meaningfully participate in the jury selection process.\"  Id. at 2. We note that the parties do not agree with the court's assertion that the materials in the case were turned over to them in the above described fashion.  Both the defendant-appellants and the government, relying on the transcript of the proceeding and the materials in the record, state that the materials were turned over to the parties after the commencement of voir dire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda states that the record does not disclose when the questionnaires were actually provided to counsel.  The government contends that the record suggests that \"the questionnaires were made available sometime after commencement of voir dire, but on September 14, 1995,\" Government's Resp. to Ortiz-Miranda's Mot. at 3 (based on a memorandum from the district court to the Clerk of the Court and the Jury Administrator dated that day) or the questionnaires were \"filed under seal in the Clerk's Office on September 19, 1995, the day after the presentation of evidence began.\"  Id. (based on Doc. 655 which was signed by Judge Fuste on September 19, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Act, the challenge along with the signed affidavit must be filed before the commencement of voir dire.  Obviously, this was not possible here because the record establishes that jury selection commenced before counsel had any opportunity to discover that prospective jurors had been excused.  In any event, we choose not to wrestle with the thorny question of whether the district court's actions mitigated counsel's duty to comply with the Act.  Even if all had proceeded ideally, the district court's erroneous exclusions did not constitute a \"substantial failure\" to comply with the Act.  See &#167; 1867(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress left the content of this term largely up to the courts.  See 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1794 (\"Your committee would leave the definition of 'substantial' to the process of judicial decision.\").  In determining whether a violation is substantial, \"the alleged violations must be weighed against the underlying principles of the Act.\"  United States v. Gregory, 730 F.2d 692, 699 (11th Cir.1984).  These principles are:  (1) the random selection of jurors;  and (2) the determination of disqualifications, excuses, exemptions, and exclusions on the basis of objective criteria only.  See id.   The inquiry is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>For wrongful exclusions, determining whether there has been a substantial violation has both quantitative and qualitative aspects.  Quantitatively, a substantial violation generally will not be found if the numbers of errors is small.  Qualitatively, the inquiry is whether there has been a frustration of the Act's underlying principle of exclusions on the basis of objective criteria only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calabrese, 942 F.2d at 227-28 (citation omitted).  Here, the number of arguably wrongfully excluded jurors was very small.  Further, the Act's principle of exclusions on the basis of objective criteria was not frustrated.  In excusing the four individuals, the district court did not engage in qualitatively improper actions such as creating a \"new category of exclusions,\" see id. at 228, or discriminating against a class of persons.  See id.   Second, the district court did not prevent the jury panel from consisting of a fair cross-section of the community.  See United States v. Bearden, 659 F.2d 590, 602 (5th Cir.1981).  His actions, though improper, did not constitute a substantial failure to comply with the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Other Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellants also argue that their rights under the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment, and Fed.R.Crim.P. 43 were violated by the district court's ex parte actions.  To the extent that the district court improperly dismissed four prospective jurors, we conclude that the errors were harmless to the defendants.  See id. at 1273 n. 11 (stating that the error must be sufficiently egregious to constitute a constitutional violation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Macho Gatillo Alias</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eulalio Candelaria-Silva argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to strike his alias, \"Macho Gatillo,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> from the Superseding Indictment.  He contends that the use of the alias was inflammatory, demeaning and prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying the motion to strike, the district court stated that \"Macho Gatillo\" served the purpose of a proper name for identification purposes.  The record reflects that the POPR officer who conducted two undercover drug purchases from Candelaria-Silva in 1990 knew him only as \"Macho Gatillo.\"   In addition, co-conspirator witness Otero-Coln also identified the defendant only by his street name.  Furthermore, another POPR officer corroborated these mutually consistent identifications of the defendant by testifying that the defendant was known as \"Macho.\"   All of this evidence was probative with respect to identifying Eulalio Candelaria-Silva as the author of the letter seized from Israel Santiago-Lugo's residence--a letter signed \"Macho\" that discussed the operations of a punto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the record reflects the existence of at least one other individual who answered to the name \"Macho.\"   For this reason, the POPR undercover officer and Otero-Coln's use of the \"Gatillo\" portion of the name, which translates as \"trigger,\" was probative to distinguish the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eulalio Candelaria-Silva's argument fails because the evidence of his alias was relevant, and there was no prejudice.  See United States v. Delpit, 94 F.3d 1134, 1146 (8th Cir.1996) (noting that the use of the name \"Monster\" was necessary to fully identify the defendant);  United States v. Persico, 621 F.Supp. 842, 860-61 (S.D.N.Y.1985) (stating that aliases and nicknames are proper in an indictment where they will be part of the government's proof at trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Co-Conspirator Testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moises Candelaria-Silva argues that the district court should have excluded the letter seized from the residence of Israel Santiago-Lugo.  The court admitted this exhibit pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) which defines as non-hearsay a statement by a party's co-conspirator made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.  We find Moises Candelaria-Silva's argument without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conditionally admitted certain evidence pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) after making the requisite findings pursuant to United States v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632, 638 (1st Cir.1980).  Later, the court expressly found that the letter met the \"in furtherance of\" requirement of 801(d)(2)(E).  At the end of trial, the court made the requisite determination for unconditional admission of the letter and other evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As grounds for exclusion at trial, Moises Candelaria-Silva argued that there existed a legitimate doubt as to whether Macho Gatillo was a member of this charged conspiracy at the time he wrote the letter.  He renews this argument on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Letters can fall within the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule.  See United States v. Richardson, 14 F.3d 666, 668-70 (1st Cir.1994).  In this case, there is more than sufficient evidence that the statements in the letter were made by a co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the charged conspiracy.  First, the seizure of the letter from Israel Santiago-Lugo's residence and references in the letter to the recipient's brother incline toward a finding that the addressee was Israel Santiago-Lugo's brother, Ral.  Furthermore, the writer, \"Macho Gatillo\"--Eulalio Candelaria-Silva--refers to the involvement of his mother in the transactions discussed.  The 1993 seizure of cristal heroin at the Candelaria-Silva residences occurred in the presence of Eulalio Candelaria-Silva's mother and Moises Candelaria-Silva.  In addition, the testimony of Otero-Coln about the Candelaria-Silvas' roles at Villa Evangelina, and the content of the letter, particularly its reference to the specific brand of heroin constitute strong evidence that the letter was prepared by a co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the charged conspiracy.  As this Court stated in United States v. Drougas:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>The source of the placemats [on which a series of handwritten names and numbers appear], the circumstances surrounding their seizure, the fact that the information corresponded to other evidence of the participants in the conspiracy, and the extreme unlikelihood that such a list would be prepared by one not privy to the operation of the conspiracy provide a sufficient basis to infer that the writings pertained to the conspiracy alleged and were made in furtherance of that conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">748 F.2d 8, 26 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in Drougas, the extreme unlikelihood that such a letter would be prepared by one not privy to the operation of the \"cristal\" heroin conspiracy provides a sufficient basis to infer that the letter pertained to the conspiracy alleged and that the statements therein were made in furtherance of that conspiracy.  See Drougas, 748 F.2d at 26.   In light of the overall evidence in the case, the references to the specific brand of heroin and the statements about price and quantity, the district court did not clearly err by admitting the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Motion in Limine</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Evidence of Prior Dispositions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Baez, Reyes-Padilla, and Moises Candelaria-Silva contend that the district court erred in prohibiting them from presenting evidence about the prior dispositions of certain local criminal charges relating to conduct involved in the charged conspiracy.  Specifically, the defendants argue that the court's decision prohibited them from presenting a defense.  We agree with the district court that the prior dispositions were not admissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding this issue, the district court explained that the local prosecutions were not relevant to this prosecution because possible explanations for the early dismissals included \"lack of evidence, unavailability of witnesses, sloppy presentation by the state prosecutors, irresponsible legal determinations, and the sort.\"   9/14/95 Order at 3. Furthermore, the district court rejected the defendants' arguments as \"a disguised attempt to argue a double jeopardy defense before the jury.\"  Id. at 4. The district court's order was proper and in accordance with this Court's recent decision in United States v. Smith, 145 F.3d 458, 461 (1st Cir.1998), holding that an acquittal instruction is not required when evidence of acquitted conduct is introduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Smith, a defendant, indicted for a drug offense and a tax offense, was acquitted of the drug offense after a trial on that charge alone.  During the subsequent trial on the tax offense, the government presented evidence of drug trafficking to demonstrate receipt of income that was not reported to the IRS.  On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to inform the jury of his acquittal on the drug charge and in barring his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses on their knowledge of that acquittal.  The defendant in Smith, like the defendants in this case, relied on language in the Supreme Court's decision in Dowling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 110 S.Ct. 668, 107 L.Ed.2d 708 (1990), to support this position.  In Dowling, the trial court instructed the jury that the defendant had been acquitted of robbing a witness and the witness's testimony was admitted for a limited purpose.  As we noted when rejecting the defendant's argument in Smith, however, \"the sentence in Dowling that begins, 'Especially in light of the limiting instructions' does not identify the language to which 'limiting instruction' refers.\"  Smith, 145 F.3d at 461.   Furthermore, since an instruction was given in Dowling, the Supreme Court did not decide the exclusion issue.  See Smith 145 F.3d at 461.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasons supporting exclusion of evidence about the dismissal of a prior prosecution are even stronger than those that support exclusion with respect to a prior acquittal.  As the district court noted, cases are dismissed for many reasons unrelated to the defendant's guilt.  The introduction of evidence of a dismissal could well mislead the jury into thinking that a defendant was innocent of the dismissed charge when no such determination has been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Certificate of Good Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moises Candelaria-Silva argues that, under Fed.R.Evid. 405, the trial court should have admitted a \"certificate of good conduct.\"   See Defendant's Br. at 23-30.  The district court, describing the certificate as a \"negative criminal record\" certified by the Puerto Rico Police, excluded the document.  We hold that the certificate of good conduct is not admissible character evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. DeJongh, 937 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1991), the district court declined to admit what this Court described as a \"Good Conduct Certificate.\"   This Court upheld exclusion on the ground of insufficient authentication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the certificate of good conduct does not satisfy Fed.R.Evid. 405, which allows proof of character:  (1) by \"specific instances of conduct,\" id., on cross-examination or where \"character or a trait of character ... is an essential element of a charge, claim, or defense,\" id.;   or (2) by \"testimony as to reputation or ... in the form of an opinion.\"  Id. Here, Candelaria-Silva cannot allege that the proffered certificate of good conduct meets either of these requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Judicial Bias</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant Moises Candelaria-Silva contends that the trial court exhibited judicial bias when it:  (1) ruled on numerous evidentiary issues during trial;  and (2) chastised counsel in front of the jury.  See Defendant's Br. at 35-40.  On review, this Court considers \"isolated incidents in light of the entire transcript so as to guard against magnification on appeal of instances which were of little importance in their setting.\"  United States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 779 (1st Cir.1994) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  Furthermore, this Court must \"differentiate between expressions of impatience, annoyance or ire, on the one hand, and bias or partiality, on the other hand.\"  Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1045 (1st Cir.1997).  On several occasions, this Court has held that a trial judge's frustration displayed at sidebar does not deprive a defendant of a fair trial.  See, e.g., United States v. Polito, 856 F.2d 414, 417-19 (1st Cir.1988) (no bias where, at sidebar, judge warns defense counsel that he is being reported to the State Bar Association for violating rules of professional conduct);  Deary v. City of Gloucester, 9 F.3d 191, 194-96 (1st Cir.1993) (no bias where, at sidebar, the trial judge told defense counsel his cross-examination of a witness was \"very devious\").  Here, Moises Candelaria-Silva has failed:  (1) to demonstrate that the trial court's actions rise to the level of bias;  and (2) to meet his burden of demonstrating serious prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moises Candelaria-Silva complains that a number of evidentiary rulings show bias.  We have examined those rulings and find they were all proper in the exercise of the court's discretion.  Accordingly, Moises Candelaria-Silva does not demonstrate judicial bias with his complaints concerning:  (1) the use of the charts prepared by the government;  (2) the display of photographs of firearms, ammunition and drugs to the jury;  (3) the admission of testimony of an expert witness to explain the drug ledgers;  (4) the exclusion of evidence of prior acquittals;  (5) the exclusion of defense impeachment evidence concerning past instances of untruthfulness;  (6) the exclusion of a utility bill to establish Moises Candelaria-Silva's place of residence as different from his mother's house;  (7) the district court's application of Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E);  (8) its admission of evidence of allegedly unrelated murders and misconduct by defendants;  or (9) its alleged approval of the government's use of leading questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Moises Candelaria-Silva's complaint about the trial court's \"facial expressions,\" Defendant's Br. at 37, falls short of the mark.  The transcript indicates that after an extensive discussion among all defense counsel, at least two defense counsel indicated that the district judge did not cover his mouth or make faces when weapons were introduced into evidence.  See 10/27/95 Tr. at 1861.  Perhaps one defense counsel accurately summed up the situation when he remarked:  \"I would also say for the record, I have been able to perceive a very high tension among all counsel.  And that every small incident, in my opinion, is blown out of proportion.\"  Id. at 1883-84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that the trial court exhibited frustration from time to time during this rather lengthy, heated trial, the strong instructions given by the trial court during and at the end of the trial should have eliminated any conceivable prejudice.  For example, shortly after the bench conference regarding facial expressions, the district court instructed the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>Remember also what I told you at the beginning, when we started the first day when I impaneled you.  Nothing that the court may say or do during the course of this trial is intended to indicate nor should be taken by you as indicating what your verdict should be.  Also, as you have perceived, throughout this trial, trial practice is very demanding of judges and attorneys and sometimes there exists at a given trial colloquy between the court and counsel.  This colloquy sometimes is easy going and sometimes I, as a judge, have to take a stand to keep proceedings returning in an orderly way.  It is very important for all of you to understand that any colloquy between court and counsel is not to be considered by you in determining the issues of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1995.   Such jury instructions are an appropriate means to \"allay[ ] potential prejudice.\"  Logue, 103 F.3d at 1046-47 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Moises Candelaria-Silva has failed to meet his burden of showing serious prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. Rule 16</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda argues that the district court should have suppressed Garca-Otero's identification testimony as the fruit of a Rule 16 discovery violation.  Although Ortiz-Miranda argued for suppression of the identification on the merits in the district court, see 11/16/95 Tr. at 3449-52, 3479-82, he never sought suppression as a discovery sanction.  Therefore, this argument is waived.  See United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546, 554 (1st Cir.1993) (\"Issues not squarely raised in the district court will not be entertained on appeal.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda argues that the evidence at trial mandated an instruction explaining the particular concerns attendant to eyewitness identification and explicitly stating that a guilty verdict required a finding of identity beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Defendant's Br. at 46.  However, we have expressly \"declined to adopt ... a rule of per se reversal [for such an error], choosing not to constrain district courts with yet another mandatory requirement.\"  United States v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1206 n. 20 (1st Cir.)  (citing United States v. Kavanagh, 572 F.2d 9, 13 (1st Cir.1978)), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 845, 111 S.Ct. 130, 112 L.Ed.2d 98 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Ortiz Miranda's assertion, he was not entitled to a particular instruction on the facts of this case.  As this Court further stated in Angiulo:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p>[T]he refusal to give a particular requested instruction, however, is reversible error only if the instruction (1) is substantively correct;  (2) was not substantially covered in the charge actually delivered to the jury;  and (3) concerns an important point in the trial so that the failure to give it seriously impaired the defendant's ability to effectively present a given defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">897 F.2d at 1205 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, Ortiz-Miranda has not satisfied the second and third prongs of the Angiulo test.  First, the district court's charge substantially covered the identification issue:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p>Let's now discuss the subject of how is it that you gauge or assess the credibility of witnesses....  In making that decision, you may take into account a number of factors, including the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p>One, was the witness able to see or hear or know the things about which that witness testified?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p>Two, what kind of opportunity did the witness have to observe facts or identify people, including the accused?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p>Three, how well was the witness able to recall and describe those things or persons observed?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>Four, how positive was the witness' recollection of facts and the identification of people, including those accused?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p>Five, what was the witness' manner while testifying?   By \"manner,\" I mean appearance, demeanor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p>Six, ... was the witness ever confused as to facts or the identification of persons, or did he or she misidentify or fail to identify a person or the accused on prior occasions?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12/1/95 Tr. at 4554-55 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Garca-Otero testified twice at trial, and thus Ortiz-Miranda had ample opportunity to develop the identification defense during cross-examination, the presentation of defense evidence, and closing argument.  Since the court's jury instructions addressed the identification issue three times, Ortiz-Miranda's \"ability to effectively present\" the identification defense was not \"seriously impaired.\"  Angiulo 897 F.2d at 1205-06.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p>VIII. Failure to Disclose and Newly-Discovered Evidence</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda argues that the government's failure to disclose during trial its knowledge of Rivera-Melendez's whereabouts, his possession of a green motorcycle, his involvement in certain criminal activity, and his association with the alias \"Cano Beeper\" in POPR records, constituted a due process violation warranting reversal pursuant to Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995).  Ortiz-Miranda also argues that newly discovered evidence from a witness who began cooperating after conclusion of the trial independently and cumulatively mandates a new trial.  Ortiz-Miranda's claims fail because, as the district court correctly concluded, there is no \"reasonable probability\" that disclosure of the Brady material during trial would have resulted in Ortiz-Miranda's acquittal.  See Gilday v. Callahan, 59 F.3d 257, 267 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1175, 116 S.Ct. 1269, 134 L.Ed.2d 216 (1996).  Nor, as the district court concluded, does the combination of the Brady material and newly-discovered evidence create such a \"reasonable probability.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda's motion for a new trial does not specifically cite the failure to disclose Rivera-Melendez's location as grounds for relief.  Rather, his counsel placed this information in an \"Affirmation\" appended to the motion.  Thus, although the district court heard evidence on this issue at the hearing, it did not specifically consider it in the Brady analysis.  The draft search warrant affidavit did not contain information about the sighting of Rivera-Melendez because that event did not occur until after the prosecutor had declined to authorize Rivera-Melendez's arrest.  In its analysis of the draft affidavit, however, the district court assumed the availability of Rivera-Melendez and determined that such availability would not have created a reasonable probability of Ortiz-Miranda's acquittal.  First, the court found it improbable that Rivera-Melendez would exculpate Ortiz-Miranda by implicating himself.  See United States v. Ortiz-Miranda, 931 F.Supp. 85, 93 (D.P.R.1996).  Furthermore, the court found it improbable that Garca-Otero would recant her identification of Ortiz-Miranda or her failure to identify Rivera-Melendez even if the defense produced Rivera-Melendez.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda does not elaborate on how Rivera-Melendez's \"very presence in court,\" Defendant's Br. at 35-36, would otherwise have created a reasonable probability of acquittal.  Such a claim is especially questionable because the jury already had the benefit of comparing photographs of the two men when assessing the accuracy of Garca-Otero's identification of Ortiz-Miranda.  The government, while conceding the possibility that Rivera-Melendez could also be involved with Israel Santiago-Lugo's organization, reasonably argued in closing arguments that the testimony of Garca-Otero and other evidence nonetheless established the guilt of Ortiz-Miranda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the draft probable cause affidavit itself, the district court determined that it \"favor[ed]\" the misidentification claim insofar as it did not contradict the Department of Transportation information about the green motorcycle and suggested Rivera-Melendez's involvement in drug trafficking.  It did not, however, exculpate Ortiz-Miranda.  See Ortiz-Miranda, 931 F.Supp. at 92-93.   Similarly, the district court correctly recognized that although the missing page of the criminal history report would have \"favored\" the defense by attributing the alias \"Cano Beeper\" solely to Rivera-Melendez, the government perhaps could have established that the POPR database was incomplete.  See id. at 93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court recognized, it is the \"reasonable probability\" standard that distinguishes merely \"favorable\" evidence from \"material\" evidence, the intentional or unintentional withholding of which violates a defendant's due process rights.  See Gilday, 59 F.3d at 267.   On this record, we agree with the district court that \"the sum of evidence withheld is hardly of the variety that would undermine our confidence in the outcome of the trial.\"  Ortiz-Miranda, 931 F.Supp. at 94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Ortiz-Miranda summarily asserts \"prosecutorial misconduct\" as grounds for reversal.  In view of the fact that he neither develops this argument nor cites any supporting authority, we reject this argument out of hand.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[A] litigant has an obligation to spell out its arguments squarely or distinctly, or else forever hold its peace.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IX. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, with respect to Count 46, conspiracy to possess cocaine and other controlled substances with the intent to distribute, Moises Candelaria-Silva argues that the evidence was insufficient because the POPR investigation that led to the seizure did not link him to the Sabana Seca residence where the seizure occurred.  This claim fails because to obtain a conviction, the investigative officers need not identify all the perpetrators prior to arrest.  Here, the testimony of Otero-Coln about the Candelaria-Silva family's use of the Sabana Seca residences to process cocaine and other drugs for distribution well supported the jury's verdict as to his involvement in the conduct charged in Count 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Rosado-Rosado and Moises Candelaria-Silva argue that the evidence established the existence of separate conspiracies.  We find their argument to be without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence presented at trial established that there was an overarching conspiracy headed by Israel Santiago-Lugo to distribute controlled substances, including heroin, cocaine, and marijuana.  The drugs were distributed at various places and by various people, including members of the Candelaria family.  As noted in United States v. Wihbey, \"[t]he question whether a given body of evidence is indicative of a single conspiracy, multiple conspiracies, or no conspiracy at all is ordinarily a matter of fact;  a jury's determination in that regard is subject to review only for evidentiary sufficiency.\"  75 F.3d 761, 774 (1st Cir.1996) (citing United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722, 732 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 989, 112 S.Ct. 605, 116 L.Ed.2d 628 (1991)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here the trial court expressly charged the jury on the multiple conspiracy defense:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p>You must decide whether the conspiracy charged in the indictment existed and, if it did, who at least some of its members were.  If you find that the conspiracy charged did not exist, then you must return a not guilty verdict, even though you may find that some other conspiracy existed.  Similarly, if you find that any defendant was not a member of the charged conspiracy, then you must find that defendant not guilty, even though that defendant may have been a member of some other conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">12/1/95 Tr. at 4569-70.  Thus, the jury verdict can be viewed as a rejection of the multiple conspiracy claim.  Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 775 n. 8 (stating that when the district court gives a multiple conspiracy instruction, a guilty verdict \"can be seen as an effective rejection of the multiple conspiracy theory\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted in United States v. Twitty, 72 F.3d 228 (1st Cir.1995), the arguments made by the defendant-appellants are not uncommon:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p>Twitty's argument is a common one in conspiracy appeals.  Whenever a conspiracy involves successive transactions and multiple players, it is usually possible to slice the enterprise into discrete portions.  Even a single conspiracy is likely to involve subsidiary agreements relating to different individuals and transactions.  And more often than not, none of the agreements is explicit;  agreement is inferred from conduct;  and the conceptual tests used to distinguish between one conspiracy and many are not sharp edged.  See, e.g., United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 17 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 231 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Wihbey, this Court, quoting United States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855, 858 (1st Cir.1987), set forth the framework for analyzing a claim that the evidence was insufficient to allow the jury to find a single conspiracy and that, instead, the evidence showed two separate conspiracies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p>(1) Is the evidence sufficient to permit a jury to find the (express or tacit) agreement that the indictment charges?  (2) If not, is it sufficient to permit a jury, under a proper set of instructions, to convict the defendant of a related, similar conspiracy?  (3) If so [i.e., the answer to (2) is yes], does the variance affect the defendant's substantial rights or does the difference between the charged conspiracy and the conspiracy proved amount to \"harmless error?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">75 F.3d at 773.  \"Put differently, so long as the statutory violation remains the same, the jury can convict even if the facts are somewhat different than charged--so long as the difference does not cause unfair prejudice.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analyzing this case under the first prong of the Glenn test, the evidence is clearly sufficient to permit a jury to find that appellants Rosado-Rosado and Moises Candelaria-Silva joined the overarching conspiracy charged in Count I. Assuming arguendo, as in Wihbey, that there was insufficient proof that appellants Rosado-Rosado and Moises Candelaria-Silva were members of the overarching conspiracy alleged in Count I, still, the second prong of the Glenn test would be answered in the affirmative.  For example, Moises Candelaria-Silva largely concedes that the evidence was sufficient to convict him of the statutory offense charged in Count I--engaging in a conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. 846.  Likewise, appellant Rosado-Rosado states:  \"It is the contention of ... appellant that the overt acts for which evidence was presented against him relate--if at all [--] to separate and distinct drug operation or conspiracy.\"   Defendant's Br. at 8. Regardless of this assertion, however, both Otero-Coln and Garca-Otero testified as to their involvement in a conspiracy with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the second prong of the Glenn test is answered in the affirmative, to obtain a reversal, appellants must meet their burden under the third prong of the Glenn test--that as a result of the variance, they were unfairly prejudiced.  See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 773.   In Wihbey, the Court noted that there were at least three ways in which such a variance might prejudice the accused.  First, a defendant may receive inadequate notice of the charge against him and thus is taken by surprise at trial.  Second, a defendant may be twice subject to prosecution for the same offense.  Third, a defendant may be prejudiced by \"evidentiary spillover\"--the \"transference of guilt\" to a defendant involved in one conspiracy from evidence incriminating defendants in another conspiracy in which the particular defendant was not involved.  See id. at 774.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the appellants in Wihbey, the appellants here have failed to carry their burden of establishing unfair prejudice.  Appellants have clearly failed to establish the applicable test with respect to a claim of prejudicial spillover--\"prejudice so pervasive that a miscarriage of justice looms.\"  Id. at 776 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Here, the jury clearly assessed the evidence against each defendant separately.  This is demonstrated by the fact that the jury declined to reach any verdict as to defendant Andrades-Marrero.  See 12/13/95 Tr. at 5093.  Thus, appellants have not established unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, defendant-appellant's \"multiple conspiracy\" argument is rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>X. Factual Findings at Sentencing</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Ortiz-Miranda</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging his sentence, Ortiz-Miranda argues that the district court erroneously attributed 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base to him based upon extrapolating from an \"average\" dosage amount.  Upon review, we conclude that the record supports the district court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court properly considered testimony concerning at least ten total cocaine base deliveries directly involving Ortiz-Miranda at the puntos in Arecibo and Vega Baja.  This estimate was based upon the trial testimony of Garca-Otero and testimony at the hearing on the motion for a new trial.  In addition, Ortiz-Miranda had been arrested at the Arecibo location with approximately 596 capsules of cocaine base in July 1994, and Ortiz-Baez had been arrested near there in 1995 with over 1200 capsules containing a total amount of 196 grams of cocaine base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garca-Otero testified that at least 500 capsules of cocaine base were distributed on a weekly basis in Vega Baja, and that Ortiz-Miranda made approximately six deliveries.  Thus, a conservative estimate of Ortiz-Miranda's direct involvement with 6,000 capsules at the two locations would yield one kilogram of cocaine base and a higher weight of the total mixture containing it, the capsules.  See USCG &#167; 2D1.1(c)*(A) (\"weight of a controlled substance ... refers to the weight of any mixture or substance containing [it]\").  In addition, the district court could reasonably infer that the additional deliveries of at least 3,000 capsules, yielding approximately another one-half kilogram of cocaine base to the Arecibo location would have been reasonably foreseeable to Ortiz-Miranda as part of the conspiracy.  Here, even using a conservative estimate, the district court properly attributed 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base to Ortiz-Miranda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Eulalio Candelaria-Silva</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eulalio Candelaria-Silva argues that, because the firearms seized from the Sabana Seca buildings were \"out of reach,\" not used, and not definitively linked to him, the district court erred in imposing the two-level increase to his guidelines offense level pursuant to USCG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).  However, at sentencing, Candelaria failed to challenge the link between himself and the firearms.  As a result, we reject his claim.  See Barnett, 989 F.2d at 554 (\"raise-or-waive\" rule not relaxed where evidence supports sentencing findings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court correctly rejected Candelaria's claim that a relationship between the drugs and the firearms was \"clearly improbable.\"   4/19/96 Tr. at 12.  Specifically, the district court determined that \"in the context of the evidence ... there [was] no doubt ... that the weapons ... had a definite, clear connection with drug trafficking.\"  Id. at 13-14.   The court stated further:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p>[T]hese were not hunting weapons.  These were not a collection of weapons.  This was not a weapon had, like many people do, to just defend their home in the event some burglar comes in ... These were loaded AK-47s and Ar-15s, we're talking about assault rifles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. After reviewing the record, we uphold the district court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Ortiz-Baez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Ortiz-Baez acknowledged his involvement as a core member of the conspiracy.  Specifically, he acknowledged working at the \"table\" in Isla Verde and going \"out hunting for people to kill them [during the drug war with the Rosarios].\"  Defendant's App. at 58.  In fact, his candor so impressed the judge that the judge adjusted his offense level for acceptance of responsibility.  See Ortiz-Baez Sentencing Findings at 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Baez now maintains, however, that the sentence imposed was \"exaggeratedly harsh,\" and alleges that the government was retaliatory in seeking a three-level, as opposed to two-level, adjustment, pursuant to USCG &#167; 3B1.1(b), for his role in the offense.  Contrary to his assertions, however, the record reflects that, because Ortiz-Baez's relevant conduct clearly involved five or more participants, he is not eligible for the mere two-level adjustment pursuant to USCG &#167; 3B1.1(c).  Thus, the district court did not clearly err.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Reyes-Padilla and Morales-Santiago</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes-Padilla argues that the district court should have imposed a lower sentence because of her age, medical condition and rehabilitative efforts.  See Defendant's Br. at 10-11.  At sentencing, however, she raised none of these claims, preferring instead to argue that she had withdrawn from the conspiracy after the 1989 execution of search warrants at her Virgilio Davila apartment.  See Defendant's App. at 66-79.  Notwithstanding this waiver, age and health are not ordinarily relevant sentencing factors, see USCG &#167;&#167; 5H1.1 &amp; 5H1.4, and Reyes-Padilla makes no argument that age and health in this case constitute a \"mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission.\"   USCG &#167; 5K2.0.  Furthermore, her rehabilitation claim is belied by the fact that, at sentencing, she refused to acknowledge participation in the conspiracy after 1989.  See Defendant's App. at 71.  The record supports the sentence imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Santiago also argues that the district court erred in determining her relevant conduct, pursuant to USCG &#167; 2D1.1, and in denying her an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to USCG &#167; 3E1.1.  See Defendant's Br. at 7-8.  Although Morales-Santiago has provided no transcript of the sentencing proceedings, the available record supports the district court's determination.  The record reflects that, during at least part of the conspiracy, Morales-Santiago was charged with storing large quantities of controlled substances, directly providing Israel Santiago's distributors with those controlled substances, collecting proceeds, and maintaining accounting records.  As such, the expansiveness of the distribution conspiracy was reasonably foreseeable to her even though she may not have participated in every transaction.  Furthermore, contrary to Morales-Santiago's assertions, the Presentence Report (\"PSR\") at 30-31 does reflect a \"thorough explanation of her participation in the case at hand\" when viewed in the context of the trial testimony of Hidalgo and Otero-Coln.  Thus, Morales-Santiago's claim has no merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XI. Forfeiture of the Montanez Property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes-Padilla makes six separate objections to the inclusion of the Montanez Property in the Final Order of Forfeiture:  (1) that there was no evidence that the property was traceable to drug proceeds;  (2) that she was denied the opportunity to have the forfeiture determined by a jury;  (3) that there was no principal asset for which the Montanez property could properly be substituted;  (4) that forfeiture of the property constitutes double jeopardy;  (5) that the government waived its right to forfeit the property as a substitute asset when it withdrew it from Count 49;  and (6) that her joint and several liability for the full amount realized by the conspiracy violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.  None of Reyes-Padilla's arguments is compelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Forfeiture of a Substitute Asset</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A criminal forfeiture order may take several forms.  First, the government is entitled to an in personam judgment against the defendant for the amount of money the defendant obtained as proceeds of the offense.  Second, to the extent the government can trace any of the proceeds to specific assets, it may seek the forfeiture of those assets directly pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a)(1).  Third, if as a result of some act or omission of the defendant, the government cannot trace the proceeds to specific assets, it may seek the forfeiture of \"any property, cash or merchandise, in satisfaction of the amount of criminal forfeiture to which it is entitled.\"  United States v. Voigt, 89 F.3d 1050, 1088 (3d Cir.1996);  see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(p) (authorizing forfeiture of substitute assets).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Voigt, the Third Circuit held that a defendant convicted of laundering $1.6 million was required to forfeit that amount as a money judgment.  See 89 F.3d at 1084.   When the government could not directly trace any forfeitable proceeds to the defendant's current assets, the court held that the government could satisfy the $1.6 million judgment by seeking forfeiture of the defendant's assets as substitute assets.  See id. at 1088.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in this case, the district court ordered forfeiture of the Montanez property as a substitute asset to satisfy, at least in part, the $6,000,000 money judgment set forth in the preliminary order of forfeiture because the government established that it could not trace any of the criminal proceeds into any of the defendant's current assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, failure to establish any nexus between the MONTANEZ property and the conspiracy is irrelevant.  In fact, such a nexus would render forfeiture of the property as a substitute asset unnecessary.  See Voigt, 89 F.3d at 1086 (\"[t]he substitute asset provision comes into play only when forfeitable property cannot be identified as directly 'involved in' or 'traceable to' [the criminal activity]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain an order forfeiting property as a substitute asset, the government need only comply with the requirements of &#167; 853(p).  In particular, substitute assets may be forfeited if the government shows that, as a result of any act or omission of the defendant, the forfeitable property \"(1) cannot be located upon the exercise of due diligence;  [or] (2) has been transferred or sold to, or deposited with, a third party.\" &#167; 853(p)(1) &amp; (2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government complied with &#167; 853(p) by submitting a motion and affidavit that recited the efforts the government had made to locate the proceeds of the drug conspiracy that would have been directly forfeitable under &#167; 853(a).  See Defendant's App. at 121-24 (Affidavit of Special Agent Felicia Ramos-Andino).  The affidavit concluded that Reyes-Padilla had \"dissipated or otherwise disposed of the proceeds of her drug trafficking,\" id. at 123, so that the proceeds could not, despite the exercise of due diligence, be located.  See id. at 123-24.   Based on this record, it was not error for the district court to order the forfeiture of \"other property of the defendant,\" &#167; 853(p), up to the amount described in the money judgment.  See &#167; 853(p);  United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 23-24 (1st Cir.1995) (affirming forfeiture of substitute assets under identical provision in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(m)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Determination of Assets</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes-Padilla contends that she was denied the right to have the jury determine whether the Montanez Property could be forfeited.  She also asserts that there was no \"principal asset\" for which the Montanez Property could properly be substituted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The forfeiture of substitute assets is a matter left solely to the court.  See Hurley, 63 F.3d at 23 (\"the statute says that an order substituting assets is to be made by 'the court' \").  As this Court explained in Hurley, the defendant has a right to have the amount subject to forfeiture determined, in the first instance, by the jury.  See 63 F.3d at 23;  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(e) (stating that the initial forfeiture is sought in the indictment and is specified in a special verdict).  But the jury has no role in determining, subsequently, whether the property has been dissipated and whether the government is thereby entitled to seek the forfeiture of substitute assets.  \"Indeed, the government might not even know that substitution is necessary until it seeks to take possession of the property specified in the initial forfeiture order.\"  Hurley, 63 F.3d at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the jury determined--by rendering the special verdict--that the conspiracy realized $6,000,000 in proceeds from the commission of the specified offenses, and that the defendant and others were jointly and severally liable for that amount.  Thus, the jury determined that the $6,000,000 was the \"principal asset\" subject to forfeiture.  In having the jury determine that amount, the defendant was afforded all of the procedural protections regarding the determination of the forfeiture by the jury to which she was entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Double Jeopardy and Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no merit whatsoever in Reyes-Padilla's contention that she was subject to double jeopardy because the government commenced its case with a civil seizure, but concluded it by proceeding under the substitute assets provision of the criminal forfeiture statute.  Nor did the government's initial inclusion, and subsequent dismissal, of the Montanez property from Counts 48 and 49 of the Superseding Indictment constitute a waiver of the right to seek forfeiture of the property as a substitute asset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A completed civil forfeiture of property does not constitute \"jeopardy\" under the Double Jeopardy Clause, and does not bar the subsequent criminal prosecution and punishment of the defendant whose property was forfeited.  See United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S. 267, 274, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 135 L.Ed.2d 549 (1996) (stating that the Supreme Court has consistently concluded that \"the Clause does not apply to [civil forfeitures] because they do not impose punishment\").  A fortiori, a civil forfeiture action that goes no further than a seizure, and never results in the entry of any civil forfeiture judgment cannot constitute jeopardy.  Moreover, this Court has recognized that it is \"perfectly proper\" to begin a forfeiture action with a civil seizure, and then to convert the action to a criminal forfeiture once an indictment is returned.  See United States v. Kingsley, 851 F.2d 16, 18 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.1988).  Indeed, that procedure is commonplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it uncommon for the government to shift theories of criminal forfeiture--from direct forfeiture to substitute assets--upon return of an indictment.  We held in Voigt that when the government's attempt to forfeit the defendant's property directly was unsuccessful, the remedy was for the government to seek forfeiture of the same property as a substitute asset under &#167; 853(p).  See Voigt, 89 F.3d at 1088.   If, as Voigt illustrates, it is proper to seek the forfeiture of property as a substitute asset even after a jury has rejected the government's attempt to forfeit the property directly, then there is no error in allowing the government to dismiss the property from the forfeiture allegation before it goes to the jury and to seek the forfeiture as a substitute asset after trial.  In dismissing the Montanez property from the forfeiture allegation in Count 49, the government simply shifted its theory of forfeiture from &#167; 853(a) to &#167; 853(p).  Doing so before submission of the case to the jury was entirely proper in light of the prosecutor's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to support direct forfeiture under &#167; 853(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Excessive Fines Clause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that criminal defendants are jointly and severally liable for forfeiture of the full amount of the proceeds of their criminal offense, and that the imposition of such a forfeiture judgment does not constitute an unconstitutionally excessive fine.  See Hurley, 63 F.3d at 23 (\"the government can collect [the amount subject to forfeiture] only once but, subject to that cap, it can collect from any appellant so much of that amount as was foreseeable to that appellant\");  see also United States v. Simmons, 154 F.3d 765, 769-70 (8th Cir.1998) (holding that each defendant is jointly and severally liable for all foreseeable proceeds of the scheme and that \"the government is not required to prove the specific portion of proceeds for which each defendant is responsible\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Hurley, we affirmed precisely the action taken here:  the imposition of an order substituting other property of each defendant up to the value of the criminal proceeds for which the defendant was jointly and severally liable.  In that case, each of the defendants, including the relatively minor participants, was ordered to forfeit substitute assets up to approximately $140 million in value.  If holding each defendant jointly and severally liable to forfeit that amount in substitute assets did not violate the Excessive Fines Clause, then the forfeiture imposed on Reyes-Padilla does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as Reyes-Padilla notes, that the Eighth Circuit has held that holding a \"secondary figure\" jointly and severally liable for the forfeiture of the full amount of the criminal proceeds may constitute an excessive fine if the defendant \"reaped little benefit\" from the scheme.  See United States v. Van Brocklin, 115 F.3d 587, 602 (8th Cir.1997).  Van Brocklin does not aid the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in Hurley, we upheld the imposition of a substitute assets order for the full amount of the criminal proceeds against relatively low-level participants who reaped little personal benefit from the criminal offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in its most recent opinion on the matter, the Eighth Circuit relied on Hurley to uphold a forfeiture order holding the defendants jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the proceeds of a bribery offense, whether or not a given defendant received those funds personally.

Although the district court determined that she was a minor participant in the offense, she served as an important link between Israel Santiago-Lugo and his distributors at the various housing projects.  Because she personally received and stored controlled substances at her apartment and at the apartment of Morales-Santiago, personally provided wholesale quantities of controlled substances to Santiago-Lugo's distributors, and also assisted with maintaining records of these transactions, she is appropriately characterized as being \"in charge of Santiago Lugo's drug trafficking business at the Virgilio Davila Housing Project in Bayamn.\"   Defendant's App. at 121 (Affidavit of Special Agent Felicia Ramos-Andino).  Reyes-Padilla was at Morales-Santiago's apartment when POPR officers seized approximately $96,000 in currency and the drug ledgers reflecting over $3,000,000 worth of transactions during a one-year period.  Given Reyes-Padilla's role, holding her liable for the full amount of the proceeds of the conspiracy falls well within the bounds we prescribed in Hurley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Reyes-Padilla does not challenge the $6,000,000 money judgment.  Rather, her appeal challenges only the forfeiture of the Montanez property as a substitute asset.  The Montanez property has a value of only $169,000.  Reyes-Padilla cannot seriously argue that the forfeiture of property valued at that amount is \"grossly disproportional\" to the gravity of a drug conspiracy that realized millions of dollars in proceeds.  See United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, ----, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 2036, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998) (holding that \"a punitive forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant's offense\").  Accordingly, the forfeiture of Reyes-Padilla's Montanez property does not violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we AFFIRM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Punto,\" which is Spanish for \"point,\" is in drug slang a place or location where drugs routinely are bought and sold</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that under the District Plan, an actively practicing attorney may request an exemption from service, but such an exemption is not automatic.

In addition, Count 43 of the indictment charged Nelson Ortiz-Baez (\"Ortiz-Baez\") with engaging in a monetary transaction in criminally derived property, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1957.  Count 46 charged Eulalio and Moises Candelaria-Silva with possessing cocaine base, cocaine and heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1).

For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government presented the testimony of three coconspirator witnesses, Marcos Hidalgo-Melendez (\"Hidalgo\"), Carlos Otero-Coln (\"Otero-Coln\"), and Noem Garca-Otero (\"Garca-Otero\").  Hidalgo pleaded guilty to Count One of the Superseding Indictment.  Otero-Coln and Garca-Otero received immunity from prosecution in exchange for their cooperation.  In addition, the government presented the testimony of numerous local police officers who executed search warrants or were otherwise involved in the investigation of the defendants and their co-conspirators.  The government also presented documentary and forensic evidence and testimony relating to firearms and drugs seized from the co-conspirators, and other pertinent evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The co-conspirator witnesses testified that Israel Santiago-Lugo (\"Santiago-Lugo\") operated several drug distribution points (\"puntos\") at various housing projects in the northern region of Puerto Rico.  With the assistance of his co-conspirators, Santiago-Lugo distributed vast quantities of controlled substances including:  (1) heroin sold under the name \"cristal\";  (2) cocaine sold under the names \"bolso rojo\" and \"rolito\";  (3) cocaine base;  and (4) marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. The Virgilio Davila Punto</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hidalgo testified that he, Ortiz-Baez, and Wilfredo and David Martnez-Matta began working for Santiago-Lugo's drug distribution ring sometime after Hidalgo moved to the Virgilio Davila housing project in 1990.  He also testified that Ortiz-Baez and others packaged drugs at two rented apartments in Isla Verde and transported the drugs to various puntos.  Hidalgo further testified that Reyes-Padilla, Santiago-Lugo's aunt, distributed drugs from a Virgilio Davila apartment used by Santiago-Lugo's grandparents.  From this apartment, Morales-Santiago supplied Santiago-Lugo's distributors with drugs, including heroin and cocaine, and maintained a ledger to account for the drugs and proceeds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 1989, the Police of Puerto Rico (\"POPR\") executed a search warrant at Virgilio Davila building 43, apartment 411.  Reyes-Padilla was at the apartment with her parents.  The search yielded twenty-six grams of cocaine and three grams of heroin packaged in over 250 small bags.  Later, on October 17, 1989, the POPR executed a search warrant at the same apartment.  When an officer first arrived, a young man was selling a controlled substance through an iron grating on the apartment door.  When the officer identified himself, the man fled inside the apartment.  A search of the apartment yielded two grams of heroin, less than a gram of cocaine, and over $2000 in U.S. currency.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, POPR officer Angel Nieves-Domnguez testified that, pursuant to a tip, he conducted surveillance of Reyes-Padilla at Virgilio Davila building 43, apartment 412 during the afternoon of October 1 and the morning of October 2, 1991.  On the first day, he observed Reyes-Padilla and Santiago-Lugo retrieve two large bags from the trunk of Santiago-Lugo's car.  Upon reaching the stairs to building 43, Santiago-Lugo opened one of the brown bags and pulled out several transparent plastic bags that each contained smaller red bags.  As Santiago-Lugo distributed the plastic bags to the persons assembled, Reyes-Padilla made notations in a notebook.  Additionally, upon receiving the packages, some recipients hid the packages in nearby garbage cans or bushes.  Reyes-Padilla took the other large brown bag up to apartment 412.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Santiago-Lugo left, the officer observed one individual--who had received a package from Santiago-Lugo--apparently selling some of the smaller red bags to a young woman near building 44.  Shortly thereafter, a young man arrived at apartment 412, and Reyes-Padilla sold the man a transparent bag appearing to contain heroin.  The next day, the officer saw Santiago-Lugo arrive and deliver yet another brown bag to Reyes-Padilla.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that month, POPR executed a search warrant at apartment 412.  At that time, defendants Reyes-Padilla and Morales-Santiago were in the apartment.  The search yielded four \"decks\" of heroin in a Sucrets box, approximately $100,000 in U.S. currency, and two notebooks appearing to contain records of drug deliveries and debts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November, POPR officers observed Rosado-Rosado and a minor each engage in an apparent sale of controlled substances and give the proceeds from the sale to a heavy-set individual.  Rosado-Rosado retrieved the drugs from a brown paper bag in his back pants pocket.  When officers entered the housing project, Rosado-Rosado and the minor attempted to flee.  Officers caught Rosado-Rosado and seized eighteen aluminum foil packets containing heroin and five bags containing cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hidalgo testified at trial about the importance of the Virgilio Davila punto as a drug distribution site.  He stated that he personally received packages of cocaine and heroin from Morales-Santiago to distribute on behalf of Israel Santiago-Lugo, and that he observed distributors from Santiago-Lugo's other puntos arrive at Virgilio Davila and receive packages from Morales-Santiago.  He identified four pages of notebook entries under the name \"Batman\" from the notebook seized in October 1991 that pertained to his distribution of marijuana and cocaine at Virgilio Davila.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the entries in the notebook was one pertaining to fifty packets of heroin, referred to as \"C\" to correspond to \"cristal,\" and one pertaining to fifty packets of cocaine, referred to as \"R\" because of the brand name \"bolso rojo.\"   Expert testimony showed that the entries recorded transactions transpiring almost daily between October 29, 1990 and October 24, 1991.  The notebooks contained a \"price structure\" table which specified the prices of multiple units with a base price of $75 per unit.  A conservative estimate of the amount of drugs distributed would be close to 50,000 units having a total value of approximately $3.5 million dollars.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Rosario Brothers</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Hidalgo learned that Santiago-Lugo and the Rosario brothers had become adversaries.  Santiago-Lugo and the Rosarios previously had agreed to share control of the drug distribution punto at Virgilio Davila in Bayamn.  According to Hidalgo, the enmity between them stemmed from a drug debt owed to Santiago-Lugo by one of the Rosarios.  Tensions escalated in early 1993 when a Santiago debt collector and a Rosario associate were both murdered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1993, Hidalgo sustained a gunshot wound when an unknown assailant or assailants fired a barrage of bullets from a moving vehicle near Virgilio Davila.  After recuperating, Hidalgo again rejoined the conspiracy.  On December 1, 1993, Hidalgo, Ortiz-Baez, Santiago-Lugo, and co-conspirator Andres Coln-Miranda were arrested in Bayamn.  Ortiz-Baez, Hidalgo, and Coln-Miranda were in possession of firearms without proper permits.  Hidalgo testified that they were armed due to the ongoing tensions with the Rosario brothers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Los Murales Punto<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Otero-Coln testified that, sometime in 1988 or 1989, SantiagoLugo's brother Ral and Jorge Martnez-Rosado (\"Fobi\") reached an agreement with Jose Roman Freites (\"Josean\") for the distribution of cristal heroin at Los Murales.  Otero-Coln, who had served as a lookout for Josean for approximately two months, became a runner who picked up drugs from Virgilio Davila.  He testified that he began picking up fifty packages, each containing ten packets of heroin and costing $70.  Eventually, he would pick up as many as 100 packages every three of four days, each costing $75.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Otero-Coln further testified that, after the POPR searched Reyes-Padilla's Virgilio Davila apartment, the distribution operation was moved to the apartment of Morales-Santiago, who also kept notebooks reflecting drug deliveries and debts.  He stated that Ortiz-Baez and others who worked at the \"table\" in Isla Verde were right-hand men for Santiago-Lugo.  These men would sometimes transport drugs to Los Murales when Otero-Coln could not.  When Reyes-Padilla was out of heroin, Santiago would direct Otero-Coln to obtain it from another distribution group and keep the profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hidalgo testified that he supervised cocaine and marijuana distribution at the Los Murales housing project in 1991 and 1992, and that during his tenure, all of the drugs distributed there belonged to Santiago-Lugo.  He knew Otero-Coln as an individual who would come to the Virgilio Davila punto to obtain heroin for Santiago-Lugo's punto at Los Murales.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. The Villa Evangelina Punto</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Otero-Coln identified defendant-appellant Eulalio Candelaria-Silva as \"Macho Gatillo,\" the overseer of the drug point at the Villa Evangelina housing project.  Otero-Coln testified that he met the Candelaria-Silvas, including Moises and Luis, after Josean agreed with Santiago-Lugo to distribute cocaine at Los Murales in exchange for a reduction in the price of heroin distributed there.  Otero-Coln stated that he would obtain cocaine from Ral Santiago-Lugo at Virgilio Davila and transport the drugs to Eulalio and Moises' house in Manat for processing to sell at Los Murales and Villa Evangelina.  Eulalio Candelaria-Silva would pick up the proceeds from Otero-Coln.  Moises assumed Eulalio's role after the latter was incarcerated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Otero-Coln testified that the Candelaria-Silvas began to distribute \"cristal\" at Villa Evangelina.  On two occasions in 1990, an undercover police officer made controlled purchases of cocaine from Eulalio Candelaria-Silva at Villa Evangelina.  In addition, POPR officers executed search warrants at the Candelaria home in 1993 and February 1995.  The 1993 search yielded controlled substances including \"cristal\" heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the government introduced into evidence a letter that had been seized from the residence of Israel Santiago-Lugo in August 1993.  The letter was addressed from \"Ral\" to \"Macho,\" and indicated that both of them were in jail at the same time.  The letter appeared to discuss price negotiations, and refer to members of the Candelaria family.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. The Enrique Catoni Punto</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Noem Garca-Otero testified that defendant-appellant Rosado-Rosado was introduced to her as \"Hormiguita,\" the supervisor of heroin, cocaine, and marijuana sales at Enrique Catoni.  Ral Santiago-Lugo introduced Ortiz-Baez as \"Mickey Mouse.\"   On one occasion, Raul Santiago-Lugo drove Ortiz-Baez to the Ramn-Sola housing project in Arecibo and left him there to supervise.  On another occasion, Ortiz-Baez and Rosado-Rosado recruited individuals to distribute drugs at the housing project.  In addition, Garca-Otero identified defendant-appellant Ral Ortiz-Miranda as someone who would bring drugs to, and pick up money from, the housing project on at least a weekly basis.  She testified that she knew Ortiz-Miranda as \"Cano Beeper.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>I. Jury Selection</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellants argue that the district court violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968 (\"the Act\"), 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1861, Fed.R.Crim.P. 43(b), and the Amended Plan for the Random Selection of Grand and Petit Jurors for the United States District Court for Puerto Rico (\"District Plan\") by ex parte eliminating jurors from the venire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Jury Selection Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act was enacted to ensure that potential jurors are selected at random from a representative cross-section of the community and that all qualified citizens have an opportunity to be considered for service.  See H.R.Rep. No. 1076 (1968), 1968 U.S. C.C.A.N. 1792.   The Act provides that each district court devise a \"local plan\" for the selection of jurors consistent with the objectives of randomness and nondiscrimination set forth in &#167;&#167; 1861 and 1862.  See &#167; 1863.  The local plan for the District of Puerto Rico was devised and approved pursuant to &#167; 1863.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Act sets forth five specific reasons a summoned juror may be excused by the district court.  They are:  (1) undue hardship;  (2) inability to render impartial service;  (3) peremptory challenge;  (4) good cause shown;  and (5) a determination by the court that his service as a juror would be likely to threaten the secrecy of the proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect the integrity of the jury deliberations, that the exclusion is warranted, and that the exclusion is not inconsistent with other provisions of the Act.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1866(c).  Section 1866(c) provides that the court may only exclude a person under (5) in open court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1. Jury Orientation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of eighty prospective jurors in the panel for this case, only sixty-two appeared for jury orientation on the morning of September 13, 1995.  At the orientation, conducted on the record but outside the presence of counsel, the district court gave preliminary instructions regarding jury service and distributed the juror questionnaires.  He told the jurors nothing specific about the case except the docket number.  The judge then instructed the jurors not to discuss the case with anyone, spoke to them about the importance of jury service, and described the questionnaire.  The judge left the courtroom while the jurors viewed the video \"Justice by the People\" and completed the questionnaires.  Upon their completion of the questionnaires, the judge returned and excused the jurors for the day.  Because only fifty prospective jurors remained after the morning orientation session on September 13, the court summoned thirteen additional randomly selected prospective jurors from two other panels.  These prospective jurors, and one late-arriving member of the original panel, then received substantially the same information and instructions from the judge and completed the questionnaires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During jury selection the next day, it became clear to Ortiz-Miranda's counsel that some of the juror questionnaires were missing.  Upon raising the matter with the district court, the judge explained to counsel that the clerk had \"highlighted\" certain questionnaires as \"problematic,\" and he had \"dealt with those obvious cases.\"   9/14/95 Tr. at 126.  Ortiz-Miranda's counsel objected to the district court's actions on the ground that it \"involv[ed] and invok[ed] Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.\"  Id. The court overruled counsel's objections, but agreed to provide counsel with the questionnaire forms and invited counsel to further object after reviewing them if counsel found that the court had \"exercised the [sic] improper discretion,\" id., in excusing fourteen prospective jurors brought to his attention by the jury clerk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p>a. Lack of Qualifications Dismissals</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to be deemed qualified to serve as a juror on a petit jury in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, an individual must be a citizen of the United States, eighteen years of age or older, have resided for a period of one year within the judicial district, and be \"able to read, write, speak, and understand the English language with a degree of proficiency sufficient to fill out satisfactorily the Juror Qualification Form and to render satisfactory jury service in this Court.\"   District Plan at 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court dismissed six of the prospective jurors based on a lack of proficiency in English.  Juror 16 stated that she had difficulty reading or understanding English and answered the question asking her to describe her work in general terms in Spanish.  Juror 17 completed almost all of the questionnaire in Spanish.  Juror 18 indicated that she had difficulty with English and also wrote in Spanish that she did not hear well.  Juror 45 completed the forms entirely in Spanish.  Juror 61 indicated that he had trouble with English and did not give more than a one word response in English to any of the questions requiring more than a yes or no answer.  Finally, Juror 93 indicated that he had trouble reading or understanding English, but otherwise completed the questionnaire in English.  After examining these questionnaires, we hold that Judge Fuste did not err by dismissing these prospective jurors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Plan also mandates that \"[n]o person shall be qualified to serve ... if he is incapable, by reason of mental or physical infirmity, to render satisfactory jury service.\"  Id.  The district court excused two jurors for medical reasons.  Juror 13 answered \"No\" to the question, \"Do you have any physical problem (for example, sight, hearing or other medical condition) that would interfere with your ability to serve?\" but a note at the bottom of the form states \"Eye ongoing medical [illegible].\"  The government contends that this note was made by the district court, but the author's identity is unclear.  The district court did write on the beginning of the form:  \"See note [page] 3 claimed ongoing eye impediment.\"   Juror 89 stated that he had \"Fibrilosis Atrial\" and that he was currently taking daily medication.  The district court excused him on account of his health and because of his answer to question # 9.  Question # 9 asked the degree of education the prospective juror had achieved.  Juror 89 had a law degree, but was retired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Although the district court's actions, with respect to these two jurors, were questionable in that Juror 13 did not state that his medical condition would interfere with his serving as a juror and Juror 89 was dismissed in part because he holds a law degree, there was at least some medical reason why both jurors could have been excused.  Accordingly, these excusals were not an abuse of discretion.  See United States v.

Juror 3 stated that he \"was the only representative of the company in Puerto Rico.  I sell generic medicine to Drug [sic] stores and Hospitals [sic] in P.R[.] My Job [sic] is mostly done by telemarketing for which I can not be away from my work for too long.  I m[sic] training a part time employee to assist me due the [sic] increase in sales.\"   The district court excused Juror 32 because she was taking care of her mother, who was in the hospital, and her grandmother, who was at home.  Although she was the \"only one\" who could help them, she stated that she would \"be very proud to participate as a juror ... and to let [her] know what [she] should do.\"   According to his notes, Judge Fuste excused Juror 70 because he was a night shift medical technician at Fajardo Hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jurors 35, 63, and 72 indicated that they had various business and personal travel plans that would conflict with the trial.  Juror 35 stated that she would be traveling during the trial to a \"Consumers Affairs annual meeting\" and then \"intend[ed] to take my vacations.\"   Juror 63 was excused by the district court on account of a pre-arranged vacation.  During the trial, she was scheduled to attend a training session and to leave with her family on a previously planned vacation.  Finally, Juror 72 was excused because he had a reservation to go to Nevada and California for a month during the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Jurors 3 and 32, but did impermissibly excuse Jurors 70, 35, 63, and 72.  With regard to Jurors 3 and 32, their questionnaires document that acting as Jurors would work an undue hardship.  However, the same cannot be said for the others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to Juror 70, we note that under the District Plan, he could have requested to be excused from jury duty.  The District Plan states that jury service by medical laboratory technicians would entail undue hardship or extreme inconvenience, and such an individual \"shall be excused from jury service upon individual request.\"   District Plan at 5 (emphasis added).  However, Juror 70 did not request to be excused or object to being a juror.  The choice not to serve on the jury at this stage was his and not the court's.  The district court acted improperly in unilaterally excusing him from jury service.  We cannot be sure whether Juror 70 desired to serve or was unaware of the District Plan's provision.  Regardless of his desire or knowledge, however, there was no prima facie reason for him to have been dismissed from the pool at this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by noting with respect to Jurors 35, 63, and 72 that the district court incorrectly described their situation to counsel the next morning at jury selection.  The district court stated:  \"What else was there?   And people with paid vacations, which they so said in a note, Judge, I'm leaving on such and such a date.  How can I detain those people?\"   9/14/95 Tr. at 127.  After a very close and careful reading of the questionnaires, we did not find any notes on them stating that any of these jurors had paid vacations.  If such a statement was made by any of the jurors to the district court, it was not recorded by the Judge on the questionnaires in the record.  Jurors 35 \"intend[ed]\" to take vacations.  For Juror 63, \"everything was set.\"   Finally, Juror 72 had a \"reservation.\"   It appears that the district court interpreted those phrases to mean paid non-refundable, non-changeable tickets although those phrases may well not have meant that at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury duty works a burden on all called to serve.  There are instances in which previously-made travel plans would cause jury service to become an undue hardship.  However, the district court all too willingly accepted the proposed excuses of these jurors without allowing the parties to examine the prospective jurors in voir dire.  Exclusions at this stage approach a ministerial function, which is why &#167; 1866 authorizes the clerk of the court under the supervision of the district court--if the District Plan so authorizes--to excuse such jurors.  See &#167; 1866(c).  If jurors are excused as a result of a non-ministerial exercise of discretion better left to voir dire itself, as occurred here, the prospects for the defendant obtaining a fair cross-section of the community could be improperly diminished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, we think it unwise for district judges to engage in ex parte voir dire beyond purely ministerial functions.  Ministerial functions permitted by the Plan and Act are usually performed by the clerk, under supervision of the court.  If a judge does no more than what a jury clerk is authorized to do in excusing jurors, that may raise an issue of allocation of court resources but does not raise an issue of impropriety.  See United States v. Calaway, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"330705\"><a href=\"/opinion/330705/united-states-v-martin-c-calaway-united-states-of-america-v-luigi/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">609</span></a></span>, 616 (9th Cir.1975).  When the court, in the absence of counsel, starts questioning jurors and excusing them based on responses which go beyond basic information about qualifications, obvious bias, or hardship, it is all too easy to slip over the line, as happened here.  Whether slipping over the line deprives a defendant of statutory or constitutional rights is another question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. The Remedy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having established that certain of the exclusions were not justified under the Act, we turn to the question of whether the Act provides appellants with a remedy.  By its terms, the Act only provides a remedy--the stay of proceedings pending the selection of a petit jury in conformity with the Act--for substantial failures to comply with its provisions.  See &#167; 1867(d);  United States v. Calabrese, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566825\"><a href=\"/opinion/566825/united-states-v-merchie-c-calabrese-jr-aka-merchie-calabrese-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">218</span></a></span>, 226 (3d Cir.1991).  In order to obtain this remedy, a party challenging the jury selection process under the Act must make his challenge \"before the voir dire examination begins, or within seven days after the defendant discovered or could have discovered, by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever is earlier.\" &#167; 1867(a).  The timeliness requirement \"is to be strictly construed, and failure to comply precisely with its terms forecloses a challenge under the Act.\"  United States v. Paradies, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728163\"><a href=\"/opinion/728163/united-states-v-daniel-m-paradies-the-paradies-shops-inc-paradies/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1266</span></a></span>, 1277 (11th Cir.1996) (citation omitted).  \"[O]nce voir dire begins, Jury Selection Act challenges are barred, even where the grounds for the challenge are discovered only later.\"  Id. at 1278 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).  The Act requires that any motion filed be accompanied by a \"sworn statement of facts which, if true, would constitute a substantial failure to comply with provisions of [the Act].\" &#167; 1867(d).  When that requirement is not satisfied, the challenge to the selection process must fail, because \"Congress left no room for ad hoc review of the usefulness of compliance with [the sworn statement] requirement.\"  Paradies, 98 F.3d at 1278 (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda's counsel objected after the district court gave counsel the list of the remaining prospective jurors and his instructions for making challenges.  She stated the reasons for her objection and the district court took notice.  See 9/14/95 Tr. at 129.  Counsel next asked if the transcript was available.  See id.   The court stated:  \"The transcript is not available.\"  Id. Counsel next asked for a continuance, which was denied.  See id.   But, the district court told counsel that she \"can examine the forms\" and that there would be \"an accounting made by the jury clerk,\" id. at 129-30, but that it would not be done \"now,\" id. at 130, because there was \"[n]o need to do that now.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With a transcript of the above events, it would seem that there would be no quarrel as to what occurred.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  In a Memorandum Order dated August 11, 1998, the district court took issue with Ortiz-Miranda's brief, stating:  \"Contrary to what is stated in the brief on appeal, counsel for all defendants, as well as trial attorneys for the Department of Justice, were given copies of [the original questionnaires of those excused] before jury selection commenced in the case now on appeal.\"   8/11/98 Memorandum Order at 1 (emphasis added).  He continued:  \"The preparation of the photocopies and sets of documents were turned over to counsel before jury selection was supervised ... and I made certain that all attorneys of record received a set of the pertinent documents so that they could meaningfully participate in the jury selection process.\"  Id. at 2. We note that the parties do not agree with the court's assertion that the materials in the case were turned over to them in the above described fashion.  Both the defendant-appellants and the government, relying on the transcript of the proceeding and the materials in the record, state that the materials were turned over to the parties after the commencement of voir dire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda states that the record does not disclose when the questionnaires were actually provided to counsel.  The government contends that the record suggests that \"the questionnaires were made available sometime after commencement of voir dire, but on September 14, 1995,\" Government's Resp. to Ortiz-Miranda's Mot. at 3 (based on a memorandum from the district court to the Clerk of the Court and the Jury Administrator dated that day) or the questionnaires were \"filed under seal in the Clerk's Office on September 19, 1995, the day after the presentation of evidence began.\"  Id. (based on Doc. 655 which was signed by Judge Fuste on September 19, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Act, the challenge along with the signed affidavit must be filed before the commencement of voir dire.  Obviously, this was not possible here because the record establishes that jury selection commenced before counsel had any opportunity to discover that prospective jurors had been excused.  In any event, we choose not to wrestle with the thorny question of whether the district court's actions mitigated counsel's duty to comply with the Act.  Even if all had proceeded ideally, the district court's erroneous exclusions did not constitute a \"substantial failure\" to comply with the Act.  See &#167; 1867(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress left the content of this term largely up to the courts.  See 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 1794 (\"Your committee would leave the definition of 'substantial' to the process of judicial decision.\").  In determining whether a violation is substantial, \"the alleged violations must be weighed against the underlying principles of the Act.\"  United States v. Gregory, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433136\"><a href=\"/opinion/433136/united-states-v-ea-gregory-vonna-jo-gregory-gw-atkinson-and-robert/\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span>, 699 (11th Cir.1984).  These principles are:  (1) the random selection of jurors;  and (2) the determination of disqualifications, excuses, exemptions, and exclusions on the basis of objective criteria only.  See id.   The inquiry is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>For wrongful exclusions, determining whether there has been a substantial violation has both quantitative and qualitative aspects.  Quantitatively, a substantial violation generally will not be found if the numbers of errors is small.  Qualitatively, the inquiry is whether there has been a frustration of the Act's underlying principle of exclusions on the basis of objective criteria only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calabrese, 942 F.2d at 227-28 (citation omitted).  Here, the number of arguably wrongfully excluded jurors was very small.  Further, the Act's principle of exclusions on the basis of objective criteria was not frustrated.  In excusing the four individuals, the district court did not engage in qualitatively improper actions such as creating a \"new category of exclusions,\" see id. at 228, or discriminating against a class of persons.  See id.   Second, the district court did not prevent the jury panel from consisting of a fair cross-section of the community.  See United States v. Bearden, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"394119\"><a href=\"/opinion/394119/united-states-v-richard-bearden-clarence-stowers-jr-and-farrell/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span>, 602 (5th Cir.1981).

To the extent that the district court improperly dismissed four prospective jurors, we conclude that the errors were harmless to the defendants.  See id. at 1273 n. 11 (stating that the error must be sufficiently egregious to constitute a constitutional violation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Macho Gatillo Alias</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eulalio Candelaria-Silva argues that the district court abused its discretion by refusing to strike his alias, \"Macho Gatillo,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> from the Superseding Indictment.  He contends that the use of the alias was inflammatory, demeaning and prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In denying the motion to strike, the district court stated that \"Macho Gatillo\" served the purpose of a proper name for identification purposes.  The record reflects that the POPR officer who conducted two undercover drug purchases from Candelaria-Silva in 1990 knew him only as \"Macho Gatillo.\"   In addition, co-conspirator witness Otero-Coln also identified the defendant only by his street name.  Furthermore, another POPR officer corroborated these mutually consistent identifications of the defendant by testifying that the defendant was known as \"Macho.\"   All of this evidence was probative with respect to identifying Eulalio Candelaria-Silva as the author of the letter seized from Israel Santiago-Lugo's residence--a letter signed \"Macho\" that discussed the operations of a punto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the record reflects the existence of at least one other individual who answered to the name \"Macho.\"   For this reason, the POPR undercover officer and Otero-Coln's use of the \"Gatillo\" portion of the name, which translates as \"trigger,\" was probative to distinguish the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eulalio Candelaria-Silva's argument fails because the evidence of his alias was relevant, and there was no prejudice.

The court admitted this exhibit pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) which defines as non-hearsay a statement by a party's co-conspirator made during and in furtherance of the conspiracy.  We find Moises Candelaria-Silva's argument without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conditionally admitted certain evidence pursuant to Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E) after making the requisite findings pursuant to United States v. Ciampaglia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"381348\"><a href=\"/opinion/381348/united-states-v-paul-ciampaglia-united-states-of-america-v-william/\"><span class=\"volume\">628</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span>, 638 (1st Cir.1980).  Later, the court expressly found that the letter met the \"in furtherance of\" requirement of 801(d)(2)(E).  At the end of trial, the court made the requisite determination for unconditional admission of the letter and other evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As grounds for exclusion at trial, Moises Candelaria-Silva argued that there existed a legitimate doubt as to whether Macho Gatillo was a member of this charged conspiracy at the time he wrote the letter.  He renews this argument on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Letters can fall within the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule.

In this case, there is more than sufficient evidence that the statements in the letter were made by a co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the charged conspiracy.  First, the seizure of the letter from Israel Santiago-Lugo's residence and references in the letter to the recipient's brother incline toward a finding that the addressee was Israel Santiago-Lugo's brother, Ral.  Furthermore, the writer, \"Macho Gatillo\"--Eulalio Candelaria-Silva--refers to the involvement of his mother in the transactions discussed.  The 1993 seizure of cristal heroin at the Candelaria-Silva residences occurred in the presence of Eulalio Candelaria-Silva's mother and Moises Candelaria-Silva.  In addition, the testimony of Otero-Coln about the Candelaria-Silvas' roles at Villa Evangelina, and the content of the letter, particularly its reference to the specific brand of heroin constitute strong evidence that the letter was prepared by a co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the charged conspiracy.  As this Court stated in United States v. Drougas:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p>The source of the placemats [on which a series of handwritten names and numbers appear], the circumstances surrounding their seizure, the fact that the information corresponded to other evidence of the participants in the conspiracy, and the extreme unlikelihood that such a list would be prepared by one not privy to the operation of the conspiracy provide a sufficient basis to infer that the writings pertained to the conspiracy alleged and were made in furtherance of that conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444351\"><a href=\"/opinion/444351/united-states-v-aristedes-drougas-united-states-of-america-v-michael-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, as in Drougas, the extreme unlikelihood that such a letter would be prepared by one not privy to the operation of the \"cristal\" heroin conspiracy provides a sufficient basis to infer that the letter pertained to the conspiracy alleged and that the statements therein were made in furtherance of that conspiracy.  See Drougas, 748 F.2d at 26.   In light of the overall evidence in the case, the references to the specific brand of heroin and the statements about price and quantity, the district court did not clearly err by admitting the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.

Specifically, the defendants argue that the court's decision prohibited them from presenting a defense.  We agree with the district court that the prior dispositions were not admissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In deciding this issue, the district court explained that the local prosecutions were not relevant to this prosecution because possible explanations for the early dismissals included \"lack of evidence, unavailability of witnesses, sloppy presentation by the state prosecutors, irresponsible legal determinations, and the sort.\"   9/14/95 Order at 3. Furthermore, the district court rejected the defendants' arguments as \"a disguised attempt to argue a double jeopardy defense before the jury.\"  Id. at 4. The district court's order was proper and in accordance with this Court's recent decision in United States v. Smith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198012\"><a href=\"/opinion/198012/united-states-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span>, 461 (1st Cir.1998), holding that an acquittal instruction is not required when evidence of acquitted conduct is introduced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Smith, a defendant, indicted for a drug offense and a tax offense, was acquitted of the drug offense after a trial on that charge alone.  During the subsequent trial on the tax offense, the government presented evidence of drug trafficking to demonstrate receipt of income that was not reported to the IRS.  On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to inform the jury of his acquittal on the drug charge and in barring his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses on their knowledge of that acquittal.  The defendant in Smith, like the defendants in this case, relied on language in the Supreme Court's decision in Dowling v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112352\"><a href=\"/opinion/112352/dowling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Dowling, the trial court instructed the jury that the defendant had been acquitted of robbing a witness and the witness's testimony was admitted for a limited purpose.  As we noted when rejecting the defendant's argument in Smith, however, \"the sentence in Dowling that begins, 'Especially in light of the limiting instructions' does not identify the language to which 'limiting instruction' refers.\"  Smith, 145 F.3d at 461.   Furthermore, since an instruction was given in Dowling, the Supreme Court did not decide the exclusion issue.

As the district court noted, cases are dismissed for many reasons unrelated to the defendant's guilt.  The introduction of evidence of a dismissal could well mislead the jury into thinking that a defendant was innocent of the dismissed charge when no such determination has been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Certificate of Good Conduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moises Candelaria-Silva argues that, under Fed.R.Evid. 405, the trial court should have admitted a \"certificate of good conduct.\"   See Defendant's Br. at 23-30.

On several occasions, this Court has held that a trial judge's frustration displayed at sidebar does not deprive a defendant of a fair trial.  See, e.g., United States v. Polito, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511568\"><a href=\"/opinion/511568/united-states-v-john-d-polito/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span>, 417-19 (1st Cir.1988) (no bias where, at sidebar, judge warns defense counsel that he is being reported to the State Bar Association for violating rules of professional conduct);  Deary v.

Here, Moises Candelaria-Silva has failed:  (1) to demonstrate that the trial court's actions rise to the level of bias;  and (2) to meet his burden of demonstrating serious prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moises Candelaria-Silva complains that a number of evidentiary rulings show bias.  We have examined those rulings and find they were all proper in the exercise of the court's discretion.  Accordingly, Moises Candelaria-Silva does not demonstrate judicial bias with his complaints concerning:  (1) the use of the charts prepared by the government;  (2) the display of photographs of firearms, ammunition and drugs to the jury;  (3) the admission of testimony of an expert witness to explain the drug ledgers;  (4) the exclusion of evidence of prior acquittals;  (5) the exclusion of defense impeachment evidence concerning past instances of untruthfulness;  (6) the exclusion of a utility bill to establish Moises Candelaria-Silva's place of residence as different from his mother's house;  (7) the district court's application of Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E);  (8) its admission of evidence of allegedly unrelated murders and misconduct by defendants;  or (9) its alleged approval of the government's use of leading questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, Moises Candelaria-Silva's complaint about the trial court's \"facial expressions,\" Defendant's Br. at 37, falls short of the mark.  The transcript indicates that after an extensive discussion among all defense counsel, at least two defense counsel indicated that the district judge did not cover his mouth or make faces when weapons were introduced into evidence.  See 10/27/95 Tr. at 1861.  Perhaps one defense counsel accurately summed up the situation when he remarked:  \"I would also say for the record, I have been able to perceive a very high tension among all counsel.  And that every small incident, in my opinion, is blown out of proportion.\"  Id. at 1883-84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that the trial court exhibited frustration from time to time during this rather lengthy, heated trial, the strong instructions given by the trial court during and at the end of the trial should have eliminated any conceivable prejudice.  For example, shortly after the bench conference regarding facial expressions, the district court instructed the jury:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>Remember also what I told you at the beginning, when we started the first day when I impaneled you.  Nothing that the court may say or do during the course of this trial is intended to indicate nor should be taken by you as indicating what your verdict should be.  Also, as you have perceived, throughout this trial, trial practice is very demanding of judges and attorneys and sometimes there exists at a given trial colloquy between the court and counsel.  This colloquy sometimes is easy going and sometimes I, as a judge, have to take a stand to keep proceedings returning in an orderly way.  It is very important for all of you to understand that any colloquy between court and counsel is not to be considered by you in determining the issues of this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1995.

Although Ortiz-Miranda argued for suppression of the identification on the merits in the district court, see 11/16/95 Tr. at 3449-52, 3479-82, he never sought suppression as a discovery sanction.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span> (1995).  Ortiz-Miranda also argues that newly discovered evidence from a witness who began cooperating after conclusion of the trial independently and cumulatively mandates a new trial.  Ortiz-Miranda's claims fail because, as the district court correctly concluded, there is no \"reasonable probability\" that disclosure of the Brady material during trial would have resulted in Ortiz-Miranda's acquittal.  See Gilday v. Callahan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196171\"><a href=\"/opinion/196171/gilday-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span>, 267 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nor, as the district court concluded, does the combination of the Brady material and newly-discovered evidence create such a \"reasonable probability.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda's motion for a new trial does not specifically cite the failure to disclose Rivera-Melendez's location as grounds for relief.  Rather, his counsel placed this information in an \"Affirmation\" appended to the motion.  Thus, although the district court heard evidence on this issue at the hearing, it did not specifically consider it in the Brady analysis.  The draft search warrant affidavit did not contain information about the sighting of Rivera-Melendez because that event did not occur until after the prosecutor had declined to authorize Rivera-Melendez's arrest.  In its analysis of the draft affidavit, however, the district court assumed the availability of Rivera-Melendez and determined that such availability would not have created a reasonable probability of Ortiz-Miranda's acquittal.  First, the court found it improbable that Rivera-Melendez would exculpate Ortiz-Miranda by implicating himself.  See United States v. Ortiz-Miranda, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></span>, 93 (D.P.R.1996).  Furthermore, the court found it improbable that Garca-Otero would recant her identification of Ortiz-Miranda or her failure to identify Rivera-Melendez even if the defense produced Rivera-Melendez.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Miranda does not elaborate on how Rivera-Melendez's \"very presence in court,\" Defendant's Br. at 35-36, would otherwise have created a reasonable probability of acquittal.  Such a claim is especially questionable because the jury already had the benefit of comparing photographs of the two men when assessing the accuracy of Garca-Otero's identification of Ortiz-Miranda.  The government, while conceding the possibility that Rivera-Melendez could also be involved with Israel Santiago-Lugo's organization, reasonably argued in closing arguments that the testimony of Garca-Otero and other evidence nonetheless established the guilt of Ortiz-Miranda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the draft probable cause affidavit itself, the district court determined that it \"favor[ed]\" the misidentification claim insofar as it did not contradict the Department of Transportation information about the green motorcycle and suggested Rivera-Melendez's involvement in drug trafficking.  It did not, however, exculpate Ortiz-Miranda.  See Ortiz-Miranda, 931 F.Supp. at 92-93.   Similarly, the district court correctly recognized that although the missing page of the criminal history report would have \"favored\" the defense by attributing the alias \"Cano Beeper\" solely to Rivera-Melendez, the government perhaps could have established that the POPR database was incomplete.  See id. at 93.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court recognized, it is the \"reasonable probability\" standard that distinguishes merely \"favorable\" evidence from \"material\" evidence, the intentional or unintentional withholding of which violates a defendant's due process rights.  See Gilday, 59 F.3d at 267.   On this record, we agree with the district court that \"the sum of evidence withheld is hardly of the variety that would undermine our confidence in the outcome of the trial.\"  Ortiz-Miranda, 931 F.Supp. at 94.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Ortiz-Miranda summarily asserts \"prosecutorial misconduct\" as grounds for reversal.  In view of the fact that he neither develops this argument nor cites any supporting authority, we reject this argument out of hand.  See United States v.

This claim fails because to obtain a conviction, the investigative officers need not identify all the perpetrators prior to arrest.  Here, the testimony of Otero-Coln about the Candelaria-Silva family's use of the Sabana Seca residences to process cocaine and other drugs for distribution well supported the jury's verdict as to his involvement in the conduct charged in Count 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Rosado-Rosado and Moises Candelaria-Silva argue that the evidence established the existence of separate conspiracies.

Whenever a conspiracy involves successive transactions and multiple players, it is usually possible to slice the enterprise into discrete portions.  Even a single conspiracy is likely to involve subsidiary agreements relating to different individuals and transactions.  And more often than not, none of the agreements is explicit;  agreement is inferred from conduct;  and the conceptual tests used to distinguish between one conspiracy and many are not sharp edged.

(2) If not, is it sufficient to permit a jury, under a proper set of instructions, to convict the defendant of a related, similar conspiracy?  (3) If so [i.e., the answer to (2) is yes], does the variance affect the defendant's substantial rights or does the difference between the charged conspiracy and the conspiracy proved amount to \"harmless error?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">75 F.3d at 773.  \"Put differently, so long as the statutory violation remains the same, the jury can convict even if the facts are somewhat different than charged--so long as the difference does not cause unfair prejudice.\"  Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Analyzing this case under the first prong of the Glenn test, the evidence is clearly sufficient to permit a jury to find that appellants Rosado-Rosado and Moises Candelaria-Silva joined the overarching conspiracy charged in Count I. Assuming arguendo, as in Wihbey, that there was insufficient proof that appellants Rosado-Rosado and Moises Candelaria-Silva were members of the overarching conspiracy alleged in Count I, still, the second prong of the Glenn test would be answered in the affirmative.  For example, Moises Candelaria-Silva largely concedes that the evidence was sufficient to convict him of the statutory offense charged in Count I--engaging in a conspiracy in violation of 21 U.S.C. 846.  Likewise, appellant Rosado-Rosado states:  \"It is the contention of ... appellant that the overt acts for which evidence was presented against him relate--if at all [--] to separate and distinct drug operation or conspiracy.\"   Defendant's Br. at 8. Regardless of this assertion, however, both Otero-Coln and Garca-Otero testified as to their involvement in a conspiracy with him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the second prong of the Glenn test is answered in the affirmative, to obtain a reversal, appellants must meet their burden under the third prong of the Glenn test--that as a result of the variance, they were unfairly prejudiced.  See Wihbey, 75 F.3d at 773.   In Wihbey, the Court noted that there were at least three ways in which such a variance might prejudice the accused.  First, a defendant may receive inadequate notice of the charge against him and thus is taken by surprise at trial.  Second, a defendant may be twice subject to prosecution for the same offense.  Third, a defendant may be prejudiced by \"evidentiary spillover\"--the \"transference of guilt\" to a defendant involved in one conspiracy from evidence incriminating defendants in another conspiracy in which the particular defendant was not involved.  See id. at 774.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the appellants in Wihbey, the appellants here have failed to carry their burden of establishing unfair prejudice.  Appellants have clearly failed to establish the applicable test with respect to a claim of prejudicial spillover--\"prejudice so pervasive that a miscarriage of justice looms.\"  Id. at 776 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Here, the jury clearly assessed the evidence against each defendant separately.  This is demonstrated by the fact that the jury declined to reach any verdict as to defendant Andrades-Marrero.  See 12/13/95 Tr. at 5093.  Thus, appellants have not established unfair prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, defendant-appellant's \"multiple conspiracy\" argument is rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>X. Factual Findings at Sentencing</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Ortiz-Miranda</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In challenging his sentence, Ortiz-Miranda argues that the district court erroneously attributed 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base to him based upon extrapolating from an \"average\" dosage amount.  Upon review, we conclude that the record supports the district court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court properly considered testimony concerning at least ten total cocaine base deliveries directly involving Ortiz-Miranda at the puntos in Arecibo and Vega Baja.  This estimate was based upon the trial testimony of Garca-Otero and testimony at the hearing on the motion for a new trial.  In addition, Ortiz-Miranda had been arrested at the Arecibo location with approximately 596 capsules of cocaine base in July 1994, and Ortiz-Baez had been arrested near there in 1995 with over 1200 capsules containing a total amount of 196 grams of cocaine base.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Garca-Otero testified that at least 500 capsules of cocaine base were distributed on a weekly basis in Vega Baja, and that Ortiz-Miranda made approximately six deliveries.  Thus, a conservative estimate of Ortiz-Miranda's direct involvement with 6,000 capsules at the two locations would yield one kilogram of cocaine base and a higher weight of the total mixture containing it, the capsules.  See USCG &#167; 2D1.1(c)*(A) (\"weight of a controlled substance ... refers to the weight of any mixture or substance containing [it]\").  In addition, the district court could reasonably infer that the additional deliveries of at least 3,000 capsules, yielding approximately another one-half kilogram of cocaine base to the Arecibo location would have been reasonably foreseeable to Ortiz-Miranda as part of the conspiracy.  Here, even using a conservative estimate, the district court properly attributed 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base to Ortiz-Miranda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Eulalio Candelaria-Silva</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eulalio Candelaria-Silva argues that, because the firearms seized from the Sabana Seca buildings were \"out of reach,\" not used, and not definitively linked to him, the district court erred in imposing the two-level increase to his guidelines offense level pursuant to USCG &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).  However, at sentencing, Candelaria failed to challenge the link between himself and the firearms.  As a result, we reject his claim.  See Barnett, 989 F.2d at 554 (\"raise-or-waive\" rule not relaxed where evidence supports sentencing findings).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court correctly rejected Candelaria's claim that a relationship between the drugs and the firearms was \"clearly improbable.\"   4/19/96 Tr. at 12.  Specifically, the district court determined that \"in the context of the evidence ... there [was] no doubt ... that the weapons ... had a definite, clear connection with drug trafficking.\"  Id. at 13-14.   The court stated further:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p>[T]hese were not hunting weapons.  These were not a collection of weapons.  This was not a weapon had, like many people do, to just defend their home in the event some burglar comes in ... These were loaded AK-47s and Ar-15s, we're talking about assault rifles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. After reviewing the record, we uphold the district court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Ortiz-Baez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Ortiz-Baez acknowledged his involvement as a core member of the conspiracy.  Specifically, he acknowledged working at the \"table\" in Isla Verde and going \"out hunting for people to kill them [during the drug war with the Rosarios].\"  Defendant's App. at 58.  In fact, his candor so impressed the judge that the judge adjusted his offense level for acceptance of responsibility.  See Ortiz-Baez Sentencing Findings at 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ortiz-Baez now maintains, however, that the sentence imposed was \"exaggeratedly harsh,\" and alleges that the government was retaliatory in seeking a three-level, as opposed to two-level, adjustment, pursuant to USCG &#167; 3B1.1(b), for his role in the offense.  Contrary to his assertions, however, the record reflects that, because Ortiz-Baez's relevant conduct clearly involved five or more participants, he is not eligible for the mere two-level adjustment pursuant to USCG &#167; 3B1.1(c).  Thus, the district court did not clearly err.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Reyes-Padilla and Morales-Santiago</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes-Padilla argues that the district court should have imposed a lower sentence because of her age, medical condition and rehabilitative efforts.  See Defendant's Br. at 10-11.  At sentencing, however, she raised none of these claims, preferring instead to argue that she had withdrawn from the conspiracy after the 1989 execution of search warrants at her Virgilio Davila apartment.  See Defendant's App. at 66-79.  Notwithstanding this waiver, age and health are not ordinarily relevant sentencing factors, see USCG &#167;&#167; 5H1.1 &amp; 5H1.4, and Reyes-Padilla makes no argument that age and health in this case constitute a \"mitigating circumstance of a kind, or to a degree, not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission.\"   USCG &#167; 5K2.0.  Furthermore, her rehabilitation claim is belied by the fact that, at sentencing, she refused to acknowledge participation in the conspiracy after 1989.  See Defendant's App. at 71.  The record supports the sentence imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Morales-Santiago also argues that the district court erred in determining her relevant conduct, pursuant to USCG &#167; 2D1.1, and in denying her an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to USCG &#167; 3E1.1.  See Defendant's Br. at 7-8.  Although Morales-Santiago has provided no transcript of the sentencing proceedings, the available record supports the district court's determination.  The record reflects that, during at least part of the conspiracy, Morales-Santiago was charged with storing large quantities of controlled substances, directly providing Israel Santiago's distributors with those controlled substances, collecting proceeds, and maintaining accounting records.  As such, the expansiveness of the distribution conspiracy was reasonably foreseeable to her even though she may not have participated in every transaction.  Furthermore, contrary to Morales-Santiago's assertions, the Presentence Report (\"PSR\") at 30-31 does reflect a \"thorough explanation of her participation in the case at hand\" when viewed in the context of the trial testimony of Hidalgo and Otero-Coln.  Thus, Morales-Santiago's claim has no merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>XI. Forfeiture of the Montanez Property</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes-Padilla makes six separate objections to the inclusion of the Montanez Property in the Final Order of Forfeiture:  (1) that there was no evidence that the property was traceable to drug proceeds;  (2) that she was denied the opportunity to have the forfeiture determined by a jury;  (3) that there was no principal asset for which the Montanez property could properly be substituted;  (4) that forfeiture of the property constitutes double jeopardy;  (5) that the government waived its right to forfeit the property as a substitute asset when it withdrew it from Count 49;  and (6) that her joint and several liability for the full amount realized by the conspiracy violates the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment.  None of Reyes-Padilla's arguments is compelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Forfeiture of a Substitute Asset</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A criminal forfeiture order may take several forms.  First, the government is entitled to an in personam judgment against the defendant for the amount of money the defendant obtained as proceeds of the offense.  Second, to the extent the government can trace any of the proceeds to specific assets, it may seek the forfeiture of those assets directly pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(a)(1).  Third, if as a result of some act or omission of the defendant, the government cannot trace the proceeds to specific assets, it may seek the forfeiture of \"any property, cash or merchandise, in satisfaction of the amount of criminal forfeiture to which it is entitled.\"  United States v. Voigt, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722380\"><a href=\"/opinion/722380/united-states-v-john-voigt/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></a></span>, 1088 (3d Cir.1996);  see 21 U.S.C. &#167; 853(p) (authorizing forfeiture of substitute assets).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Voigt, the Third Circuit held that a defendant convicted of laundering $1.6 million was required to forfeit that amount as a money judgment.  See 89 F.3d at 1084.   When the government could not directly trace any forfeitable proceeds to the defendant's current assets, the court held that the government could satisfy the $1.6 million judgment by seeking forfeiture of the defendant's assets as substitute assets.  See id. at 1088.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, in this case, the district court ordered forfeiture of the Montanez property as a substitute asset to satisfy, at least in part, the $6,000,000 money judgment set forth in the preliminary order of forfeiture because the government established that it could not trace any of the criminal proceeds into any of the defendant's current assets.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, failure to establish any nexus between the MONTANEZ property and the conspiracy is irrelevant.  In fact, such a nexus would render forfeiture of the property as a substitute asset unnecessary.  See Voigt, 89 F.3d at 1086 (\"[t]he substitute asset provision comes into play only when forfeitable property cannot be identified as directly 'involved in' or 'traceable to' [the criminal activity]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To obtain an order forfeiting property as a substitute asset, the government need only comply with the requirements of &#167; 853(p).  In particular, substitute assets may be forfeited if the government shows that, as a result of any act or omission of the defendant, the forfeitable property \"(1) cannot be located upon the exercise of due diligence;  [or] (2) has been transferred or sold to, or deposited with, a third party.\" &#167; 853(p)(1) &amp; (2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government complied with &#167; 853(p) by submitting a motion and affidavit that recited the efforts the government had made to locate the proceeds of the drug conspiracy that would have been directly forfeitable under &#167; 853(a).  See Defendant's App. at 121-24 (Affidavit of Special Agent Felicia Ramos-Andino).  The affidavit concluded that Reyes-Padilla had \"dissipated or otherwise disposed of the proceeds of her drug trafficking,\" id. at 123, so that the proceeds could not, despite the exercise of due diligence, be located.  See id. at 123-24.   Based on this record, it was not error for the district court to order the forfeiture of \"other property of the defendant,\" &#167; 853(p), up to the amount described in the money judgment.  See &#167; 853(p);  United States v. Hurley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702294\"><a href=\"/opinion/702294/united-states-v-vincent-hurley-united-states-of-america-v-carlo-demarco/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 23-24 (1st Cir.1995) (affirming forfeiture of substitute assets under identical provision in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1963(m)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Determination of Assets</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reyes-Padilla contends that she was denied the right to have the jury determine whether the Montanez Property could be forfeited.  She also asserts that there was no \"principal asset\" for which the Montanez Property could properly be substituted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The forfeiture of substitute assets is a matter left solely to the court.  See Hurley, 63 F.3d at 23 (\"the statute says that an order substituting assets is to be made by 'the court' \").  As this Court explained in Hurley, the defendant has a right to have the amount subject to forfeiture determined, in the first instance, by the jury.  See 63 F.3d at 23;  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 31(e) (stating that the initial forfeiture is sought in the indictment and is specified in a special verdict).  But the jury has no role in determining, subsequently, whether the property has been dissipated and whether the government is thereby entitled to seek the forfeiture of substitute assets.  \"Indeed, the government might not even know that substitution is necessary until it seeks to take possession of the property specified in the initial forfeiture order.\"  Hurley, 63 F.3d at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the jury determined--by rendering the special verdict--that the conspiracy realized $6,000,000 in proceeds from the commission of the specified offenses, and that the defendant and others were jointly and severally liable for that amount.  Thus, the jury determined that the $6,000,000 was the \"principal asset\" subject to forfeiture.  In having the jury determine that amount, the defendant was afforded all of the procedural protections regarding the determination of the forfeiture by the jury to which she was entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Double Jeopardy and Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no merit whatsoever in Reyes-Padilla's contention that she was subject to double jeopardy because the government commenced its case with a civil seizure, but concluded it by proceeding under the substitute assets provision of the criminal forfeiture statute.  Nor did the government's initial inclusion, and subsequent dismissal, of the Montanez property from Counts 48 and 49 of the Superseding Indictment constitute a waiver of the right to seek forfeiture of the property as a substitute asset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A completed civil forfeiture of property does not constitute \"jeopardy\" under the Double Jeopardy Clause, and does not bar the subsequent criminal prosecution and punishment of the defendant whose property was forfeited.  See United States v. Ursery, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118052\"><a href=\"/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span>, 274, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118052\"><a href=\"/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span> (1996) (stating that the Supreme Court has consistently concluded that \"the Clause does not apply to [civil forfeitures] because they do not impose punishment\").  A fortiori, a civil forfeiture action that goes no further than a seizure, and never results in the entry of any civil forfeiture judgment cannot constitute jeopardy.  Moreover, this Court has recognized that it is \"perfectly proper\" to begin a forfeiture action with a civil seizure, and then to convert the action to a criminal forfeiture once an indictment is returned.  See United States v. Kingsley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508510\"><a href=\"/opinion/508510/united-states-v-michael-j-kingsley/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 18 &amp; n. 1 (1st Cir.1988).  Indeed, that procedure is commonplace.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is it uncommon for the government to shift theories of criminal forfeiture--from direct forfeiture to substitute assets--upon return of an indictment.  We held in Voigt that when the government's attempt to forfeit the defendant's property directly was unsuccessful, the remedy was for the government to seek forfeiture of the same property as a substitute asset under &#167; 853(p).  See Voigt, 89 F.3d at 1088.   If, as Voigt illustrates, it is proper to seek the forfeiture of property as a substitute asset even after a jury has rejected the government's attempt to forfeit the property directly, then there is no error in allowing the government to dismiss the property from the forfeiture allegation before it goes to the jury and to seek the forfeiture as a substitute asset after trial.  In dismissing the Montanez property from the forfeiture allegation in Count 49, the government simply shifted its theory of forfeiture from &#167; 853(a) to &#167; 853(p).  Doing so before submission of the case to the jury was entirely proper in light of the prosecutor's conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to support direct forfeiture under &#167; 853(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Excessive Fines Clause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-established that criminal defendants are jointly and severally liable for forfeiture of the full amount of the proceeds of their criminal offense, and that the imposition of such a forfeiture judgment does not constitute an unconstitutionally excessive fine.  See Hurley, 63 F.3d at 23 (\"the government can collect [the amount subject to forfeiture] only once but, subject to that cap, it can collect from any appellant so much of that amount as was foreseeable to that appellant\");  see also United States v. Simmons, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757649\"><a href=\"/opinion/757649/united-states-v-cathryn-m-simmons-united-states-of-america-v-michael-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">765</span></a></span>, 769-70 (8th Cir.1998) (holding that each defendant is jointly and severally liable for all foreseeable proceeds of the scheme and that \"the government is not required to prove the specific portion of proceeds for which each defendant is responsible\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Hurley, we affirmed precisely the action taken here:  the imposition of an order substituting other property of each defendant up to the value of the criminal proceeds for which the defendant was jointly and severally liable.  In that case, each of the defendants, including the relatively minor participants, was ordered to forfeit substitute assets up to approximately $140 million in value.  If holding each defendant jointly and severally liable to forfeit that amount in substitute assets did not violate the Excessive Fines Clause, then the forfeiture imposed on Reyes-Padilla does not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true, as Reyes-Padilla notes, that the Eighth Circuit has held that holding a \"secondary figure\" jointly and severally liable for the forfeiture of the full amount of the criminal proceeds may constitute an excessive fine if the defendant \"reaped little benefit\" from the scheme.  See United States v. Van Brocklin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741804\"><a href=\"/opinion/741804/united-states-v-darrell-dean-van-brocklin-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></a></span>, 602 (8th Cir.1997).  Van Brocklin does not aid the defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, in Hurley, we upheld the imposition of a substitute assets order for the full amount of the criminal proceeds against relatively low-level participants who reaped little personal benefit from the criminal offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in its most recent opinion on the matter, the Eighth Circuit relied on Hurley to uphold a forfeiture order holding the defendants jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the proceeds of a bribery offense, whether or not a given defendant received those funds personally.  See Simmons, 154 F.3d at 769.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, it is appropriate to hold Reyes-Padilla accountable.  Although the district court determined that she was a minor participant in the offense, she served as an important link between Israel Santiago-Lugo and his distributors at the various housing projects.  Because she personally received and stored controlled substances at her apartment and at the apartment of Morales-Santiago, personally provided wholesale quantities of controlled substances to Santiago-Lugo's distributors, and also assisted with maintaining records of these transactions, she is appropriately characterized as being \"in charge of Santiago Lugo's drug trafficking business at the Virgilio Davila Housing Project in Bayamn.\"   Defendant's App. at 121 (Affidavit of Special Agent Felicia Ramos-Andino).  Reyes-Padilla was at Morales-Santiago's apartment when POPR officers seized approximately $96,000 in currency and the drug ledgers reflecting over $3,000,000 worth of transactions during a one-year period.  Given Reyes-Padilla's role, holding her liable for the full amount of the proceeds of the conspiracy falls well within the bounds we prescribed in Hurley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Reyes-Padilla does not challenge the $6,000,000 money judgment.  Rather, her appeal challenges only the forfeiture of the Montanez property as a substitute asset.  The Montanez property has a value of only $169,000.  Reyes-Padilla cannot seriously argue that the forfeiture of property valued at that amount is \"grossly disproportional\" to the gravity of a drug conspiracy that realized millions of dollars in proceeds.  See United States v. Bajakajian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></a></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2028</span></a></span>, 2036, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118234\"><a href=\"/opinion/118234/united-states-v-bajakajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span> (1998) (holding that \"a punitive forfeiture violates the Excessive Fines Clause if it is grossly disproportional to the gravity of a defendant's offense\").  Accordingly, the forfeiture of Reyes-Padilla's Montanez property does not violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated in this opinion, we AFFIRM.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"Punto,\" which is Spanish for \"point,\" is in drug slang a place or location where drugs routinely are bought and sold</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that under the District Plan, an actively practicing attorney may request an exemption from service, but such an exemption is not automatic.
