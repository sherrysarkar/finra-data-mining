Curhan, with whom William T. Kennedy was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     John C. Skinner, with whom William O.

In    this    Massachusetts\n\ndiversity case plaintiff-appellant, Grace Langill, the insured\n\nowner of a residential property, challenges the invocation by\n\ndefendant-appellee insurance company, Vermont Mutual Insurance\n\nCo.,    of    a     statutorily   required         \"vacancy\"      exclusion     in\n\nplaintiff's policy, to deny coverage for fire damage to the\n\nproperty.         Appellant appeals from a partial summary judgment\n\ngranted to defendant prior to trial.                We affirm.\n\n                             Factual Background\n\n       The insured premises are a rental dwelling at 158 Mansfield\n\nAvenue (158) in Norton, Massachusetts, some thirty-five to forty\n\nfeet   away    from    appellant's     own    residence     at    156   Mansfield\n\nAvenue.      In February 1999, two tenants who had lived at 158 for\n\ntwelve years        moved out, leaving the property in a condition\n\nshowing considerable wear and tear.               Soon after their departure,\n\nappellant's        husband   undertook       to    refurbish      the   house   by\n\ncleaning, removing debris, filling nail holes, painting walls,\n\nrepairing     several    windows,      and   installing      Venetian    blinds.\n\nDuring this period, doors were kept locked, utilities were\n\nmaintained, and heating oil was supplied.                 In the premises were\n\nMr. Langill's tools, a step ladder, two chairs, a mattress,\n\nframe and box spring, a radio and an ash tray.\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n                                        3\n\f    It was Mr. Langill's practice to spend one to two hours a\n\nday working at 158 starting at 11:00 a.m. or noon.             A longer\n\ntime would place undue strain on his arm.          He would sometimes\n\nvisit the premises at night to smoke or meet with friends; he\n\nhad coffee there with a friend six or seven times.               On one\n\nnight, after an argument with appellant, he had stayed all\n\nnight.\n\n    On May 4, 1999, Mr. Langill was at 158 from 10:30 a.m. until\n\napproximately noon.    He spent the rest of the day at his house,\n\nsave a visit to a store to buy a newspaper.        At 2:00 a.m. on May\n\n5, he was awakened by appellant and saw \"a big orange ball\" of\n\nfire at 158.    By this time the fire was well advanced on one\n\nwall.    The Norton Fire Investigator concluded that the fire was\n\nan arson.\n\n    Appellant's \"Dwelling Fire Policy\" included, as required by\n\nMassachusetts    General   Laws   ch.   175,   §   99,   the   following\n\nexclusionary clause:\n\n    27. Vacancy. Unless otherwise provided in writing, we\n    will not be liable for loss caused by fire or\n    lightning occurring while a described building is\n    vacant, whether intended for occupancy by owner or\n    tenant, beyond a period of sixty consecutive days for\n    residential purposes of three units or less, and\n    thirty consecutive days for all other residential\n    purposes.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n                                   4\n\f                                Discussion\n\n           The question presented to us and to the district court\n\nis whether under Massachusetts law, the undisputed facts depict\n\na dwelling that had been, at the time of the fire, \"vacant\" for\n\nmore than sixty consecutive days.          This is a matter of law and\n\nour review is de novo.      We also are bound by the Massachusetts\n\nrule that \"[b]ecause the language of the standard policy is\n\nprescribed by statute . . . , the rule of construction resolving\n\nambiguities in a policy against the insurer is inapplicable. .\n\n. . Instead, we must ascertain the fair meaning of the language\n\nused, as applied to the subject matter.\"        Bilodeau v. Lumbermens\n\nMut. Cas. Co., 392 Mass. 537, 541, 467 N.E.2d 137, 140 (1984)\n\n(internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\n    Two Massachusetts cases have been called to our attention.\n\nThe earlier is Will Realty Corp. v. Transportation Ins. Co., 22\n\nMass. App. Ct. 918, 492 N.E.2d 372 (1986).          After a tenant was\n\nevicted and left a rundown house, the windows were boarded and\n\nthe only activity occurred on two days when workmen removed from\n\nthe house doors, windows and sinks.             A fire destroyed the\n\nbuilding several months later.        In reversing a ruling that the\n\nproperty had not been \"vacant,\" the court said, \"the policy\n\nprovision reflects the commonplace observation that the risk of\n\ncasualty   is   higher   when   premises   remain   unattended.   .   .   .\n\n                                   -5-\n                                    5\n\f[P]remises may be vacant despite sporadic entry.\"                   22 Mass. App.\n\nCt. at 919, 492 N.E.2d at 373.\n\n       A more recent case is helpful, not so much in its precise\n\nholding, as in its discussion of policy underlying the \"vacancy\"\n\nexclusion. See Aguiar v. Generali Assicurazioni Ins. Co., 47\n\nMass. App. Ct. 687, 715 N.E.2d 1046 (1999).              A restaurant, which\n\nhad closed for the season on Labor Day, was destroyed by fire\n\napproximately two months later.1 Before the fire, the restaurant\n\nhad   been   unoccupied    and     utilities     had    been    shut    off.      In\n\naffirming the trial court's ruling that the property had been\n\nvacant for the required period, the appeals court \"illuminated\n\nwhy an insurer would be concerned about an unoccupied building\"\n\nby    explaining   that    arsonists      had   attempted      to   destroy     the\n\nbuilding several times in the months before they ultimately\n\nsucceeded.    47   Mass.    App.    Ct.   at    689,   715     N.E.2d   at     1047.\n\nMoreover,    in    discussing       the     insured's     argument       that     he\n\nreasonably expected to be covered under the insurance policy,\n\nthe court commented:\n\n       [w]hen reasonable expectations analysis comes into\n       play, it is more likely to do so when the task is to\n       interpret an ambiguous provision rather than an\n       unambiguous one whose meaning, as in this case, no one\n\n\n       1\n     At the time, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99 provided for a\nvacancy period of only thirty days before the vacancy exclusion\ncould be invoked.\n\n                                      -6-\n                                       6\n\f       disputes. . . . They could not reasonably have\n       expected that leaving the building vacant did not\n       alter the underwriting condition.\n\n47 Mass. App. Ct. at 691, 715 N.E.2d at 1048.\n\n       Neither case neatly covers the facts in the case at bar.\n\nIn both cases no activity was going on in the premises.                       In\n\nAguiar, at least, the premises were not devoid of contents. It\n\nis clear, however, that the court was not equating \"vacant\" with\n\n\"abandonment,\" as do some jurisdictions. See, e.g., Jerry v.\n\nKentucky Cent. Ins. Co., 836 S.W.2d 812, 815 (Tex. App. 1992)\n\n(\"entire     abandonment\").       It   is    also   clear   that    having    the\n\nbuilding \"attended\" and \"occupied\" is the central theme.\n\n       The   question   remains    whether      this   requirement      can    be\n\nsatisfied     by   regular    visits     and    activities,        although    of\n\nrelatively brief nature, by someone other than a resident of the\n\nbuilding.     We are helped by reflecting on the reasons underlying\n\nvacancy exclusions.      In considering the vacancy exclusion of a\n\npolicy insuring a warehouse, the Fourth Circuit explained:\n\n       When a building is not in use, it is more likely that\n       potential fire hazards will remain undiscovered or\n       unremedied. Chances are also greater that a fire in\n       a vacant building will burn for a longer period and\n       cause greater damage before being detected.\n\nCatalina Enter. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 67 F.3d 63, 66 (4th\n\nCir.    1993).     Surely,    these     considerations      are     even     more\n\napplicable to one insuring a dwelling.\n\n                                       -7-\n                                        7\n\f       When we review the undisputed facts of this case, in light\n\nof these policy concerns, we can readily see their lack of fit.\n\nThat    is,   the    approximation       to     an     inhabited     abode    is   not\n\nmeasurably     advanced     by    the    motley      and    sparse     inventory   of\n\nchairs, mattress, and step ladder.                Nor does the midday hour or\n\nso of work activity convey the appearance of residential living.\n\nAnd random evening visits hardly provide the appearance of\n\nsomebody being at home or effective anti-vandal protection.                        The\n\nfact is that none of the activities of Mr. Langill or others\n\nchanged the fact that at the critical and likely times for\n\nvandalism     and    arson,      there    was     no    one    in    the   house    to\n\ndiscourage, see, or hear marauders, or to hear the activation of\n\nsmoke detectors.\n\n       A recent New York case seems both apposite and persuasive.\n\nIn Lamoureux v. New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 244 A.D.2d\n\n645,   663    N.Y.S.2d     914   (N.Y.    App.       Div.     1997),    the   insured\n\nbuilding was a one-family residence located adjacent to and\n\nbehind plaintiff’s residence.              The premises were destroyed by\n\nfire three months after the plaintiff's tenant had moved out.\n\nThe policy excluded coverage for loss if the building were\n\nvacant    over      60   consecutive      days.          Plaintiff’s       principal\n\nchallenge to a finding of vacancy was that he was personally\n\nrenovating the house and was inside the building every day for\n\n                                         -8-\n                                          8\n\fa couple of hours.         The court reversed the trial court's denial\n\nof the insurer's motion for summary judgment, “[g]iving the word\n\nvacant its plain and ordinary meaning. . . .”                           244 A.D.2d at\n\n646, 663 N.Y.S.2d at 915.          It also ruled that because \"plaintiff\n\nhimself was never an inhabitant of the premises, the fact that\n\nhe frequented the premises for the purpose of renovation is not\n\ngermane to the issue of vacancy.”                Id.\n\n     We think the Massachusetts courts would similarly rule on\n\nthe record before us.         When we consider the nature of the hazard\n\nsought to be guarded against,                  the sustained presence of a\n\nresident,    particularly         in   the     hours   of     darkness,            appears\n\nlogically    as    the    critical     factor    where      the    premises         are    a\n\ndwelling.         Of    course,   this    also      assumes       the    presence         of\n\nfurnishings       and    amenities     “minimally        necessary           for    human\n\nhabitation.”       American Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Durrence, 872 F.2d\n\n378, 379 (11th Cir. 1989).\n\n     We recognize, as this case illustrates, that there is a wide\n\ncontinuum    between       residency     and    absolute      absence         of    human\n\npresence from the premises.            And we do not intend to foreclose\n\nthe possibility of a set of facts not involving a resident but\n\nso   paralleling        the   conditions       of    residency          as    to    avoid\n\napplication of the exclusion clause.                   But we think that in\n\ngeneral     the    multi-factor        approach      urged    by        appellant         is\n\n                                         -9-\n                                          9\n\finconsistent with Massachusetts law.             What seems preeminent in\n\nthis    insurance    context,    for    both   insurer      and   insured,      is\n\npredictability.      To the extent that a multi-factor             approach is\n\nsuggested, such as including the presence or absence of tenants,\n\nthe    habitability    or    absence    thereof,     the    number,      nature,\n\nduration,    and    regularity   of     activities    and    visits      by   non-\n\nresidents,    and    the    proximity    of    the   insured      site   to    the\n\nresidence, any predictability is fatally compromised.\n\n       Appellant has vigorously invoked dictionary definitions and\n\ncase law to serve his purpose.           As might be suspected, where a\n\nhost of things can be spoken of as “vacant,” from rooms and\n\nhouses to stores, positions, and expressions, definitions are\n\nlegion.    Appellant has relied on those that stress a space being\n\n“devoid of contents.” Webster’s New World Dictionary, 1968 ed.,\n\np. 1606.     This is a perfectly good definition but it has been\n\nimpliedly rejected by Aquiar. Moreover, reference to absence of\n\ncontents would be more relevant if one were considering whether\n\na warehouse were vacant.          The absence of that for which the\n\npremises were intended to be used would seem to be the proper\n\nobject of inquiry.         Appellee’s choice of another of Webster’s\n\ndefinitions seems more of a fit: “untenanted; not in use, as a\n\nroom or a house.” Id.        We note as well that the language of the\n\nprovision, \"whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant,\"\n\n                                      -10-\n                                       10\n\fdirects us to give no special consideration to purpose of the\n\nbuilding   as   one   to   rented   rather   than   one    to   be   used   by\n\nappellant.\n\n    Appellant’s reliance on cases illustrates the hazard of\n\nfocusing on text to the exclusion of context.                   For example,\n\ncases are cited for the proposition that efforts to rehabilitate\n\nproperty preclude a finding of vacancy. See               Knight v. United\n\nStates Fid. & Guar. Co., 123 Ga. App. 833, 182 S.E.2d 693\n\n(1971); Limbaugh v. Columbia Ins. Co. of N.Y., 368 S.W.2d 921\n\n(Mo. Ct. App. 1963).       Knight involved installing new equipment,\n\npainting, and making ready a service station and restaurant for\n\nreopening and Limbaugh similar activities to ready a recreation\n\nhall and package liquor store for opening.          In both cases there\n\nwere policy exclusions if the premises were “unoccupied” for\n\nsixty days.     Knight relied on the reasoning of               Limbaugh, in\n\nwhich the court said:\n\n    The word “occupancy” itself, as used in insurance\n    policies, refers to the presence of persons within the\n    building. This is particularly true as it relates to\n    dwelling houses.   They are expected to be places of\n    human habitation where people live and dine and sleep.\n    This cannot be said of a recreation hall and package\n    liquor store, for the nature of the occupancy does not\n    warrant the conclusion.\n\nLimbaugh, 368 S.W.2d at 924.         The court accordingly held that\n\ncleaning and repainting the interior of the liquor store “would\n\n\n                                    -11-\n                                     11\n\fbe an activity consistent with its occupation as such.”          Id. at\n\n925.\n\n       Not only does the meaning of “vacancy” depend on the type\n\nof premises involved, but also the type of insurance policy.\n\nAppellant    seeks   comfort   from   Ellmex   Constr.   Co.,   Inc.   v.\n\nRepublic Ins. Co., 202 N.J. Super. 195, 494 A.2d 339 (N.J.\n\nSuper. Ct. App. Div. 1985), which held that the presence in a\n\nmodel home of realtors for four days every week constituted\n\nsufficient presence to defeat a thirty day vacancy exclusion\n\nclause.     But the court noted that the policy involved was a\n\n“builder’s risk” policy, which should not be interpreted as are\n\npolicies insuring ordinary homeowners.         202 N.J. Super. at 204,\n\n494 A.2d at 344. The latter policies, observed the court, “may,\n\nand usually do, require the insured dwelling to be occupied as\n\na place of abode.” 202 N.J. Super. at 203-04, 494 A.2d at 343.\n\nIt consequently felt free to depart from this standard and,\n\nresolving ambiguity against the insurer, held that defendant had\n\nnot required that the premises be “occupied” twenty-four hours\n\nper day.\n\n       Finally, it is important to distinguish cases according wide\n\nelasticity to the word “occupancy,” after finding the word\n\nambiguous and construing the term in favor of the insured. See\n\nSmith v.    Lumbermen’s Mut. Ins. Co., 101 Mich. App. 78, 300\n\n                                 -12-\n                                  12\n\fN.W.2d 457 (1981);        Drummond v.        Hartford Fire Ins. Co.,         343\n\nS.W.2d 84 (Mo. Ct. App. 1960).           In     Smith, the court held that\n\nwhere the insurer knew that a dwelling was under a contract of\n\nsale, a temporary vacancy pending arrival of the new resident-\n\nowner   was    “not   within    the   vacancy    clause,       absent   a   clear\n\nexpression of intent in the insurance policy.”                  101 Mich.

Appellant appeals from a partial summary judgment granted to defendant prior to trial. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The insured premises are a rental dwelling at 158 Mansfield Avenue (158) in Norton, Massachusetts, some thirty-five to forty feet away from appellant's own residence at 156 Mansfield Avenue. In February 1999, two tenants who had lived at 158 for twelve years moved out, leaving the property in a condition showing considerable wear and tear. Soon after their departure, appellant's husband undertook to refurbish the house by cleaning, removing debris, filling nail holes, painting walls, repairing several windows, and installing Venetian blinds. During this period, doors were kept locked, utilities were maintained, and heating oil was supplied. In the premises were Mr. Langill's tools, a step ladder, two chairs, a mattress, frame and box spring, a radio and an ash tray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was Mr. Langill's practice to spend one to two hours a day working at 158 starting at 11:00 a.m. or noon. A longer time would place undue strain on his arm. He would sometimes visit the premises at night to smoke or meet with friends; he had coffee there with a friend six or seven times. On one night, after an argument with appellant, he had stayed all night.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 4, 1999, Mr. Langill was at 158 from 10:30 a.m. until approximately noon. He spent the rest of the day at his house, save a visit to a store to buy a newspaper. At 2:00 a.m. on May 5, he was awakened by appellant and saw \"a big orange ball\" of fire at 158. By this time the fire was well advanced on one wall. The Norton Fire Investigator concluded that the fire was an arson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's \"Dwelling Fire Policy\" included, as required by Massachusetts General Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99, the following exclusionary clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">27. Vacancy. Unless otherwise provided in writing, we will not be liable for loss caused by fire or lightning occurring while a described building is vacant, whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant, beyond a period of sixty consecutive days for residential purposes of three units or less, and thirty consecutive days for all other residential purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question presented to us and to the district court is whether under Massachusetts law, the undisputed facts depict a dwelling that had been, at the time of the fire, \"vacant\" for more than sixty consecutive days. This is a matter of law and our review is de novo. We also are bound by the Massachusetts rule that \"[b]ecause the language of the standard policy is prescribed by statute . . . , the rule of construction resolving ambiguities in a policy against the insurer is inapplicable. . . . Instead, we must ascertain the fair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter.\" Bilodeau v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 392 Mass. 537, 541, 467 N.E.2d 137, 140 (1984) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two Massachusetts cases have been called to our attention. The earlier is Will Realty Corp. v. Transportation Ins. Co., 22 Mass. App. Ct. 918, 492 N.E.2d 372 (1986). After a tenant was evicted and left a rundown house, the windows were boarded and the only activity occurred on two days when workmen removed from the house doors, windows and sinks. A fire destroyed the building several months later. In reversing a ruling that the property had not been \"vacant,\" the court said, \"the policy provision reflects the commonplace observation that the risk of casualty is higher when premises remain unattended. . . . [P]remises may be vacant despite sporadic entry.\" 22 Mass. App. Ct. at 919, 492 N.E.2d at 373.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A more recent case is helpful, not so much in its precise holding, as in its discussion of policy underlying the \"vacancy\" exclusion. See Aguiar v. Generali Assicurazioni Ins. Co., 47 Mass. App. Ct. 687, 715 N.E.2d 1046 (1999). A restaurant, which had closed for the season on Labor Day, was destroyed by fire approximately two months later.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Before the fire, the restaurant had been unoccupied and utilities had been shut off. In affirming the trial court's ruling that the property had been vacant for the required period, the appeals court \"illuminated why an insurer would be concerned about an unoccupied building\" by explaining that arsonists had attempted to destroy the building several times in the months before they ultimately succeeded. 47 Mass. App. Ct. at 689, 715 N.E.2d at 1047. Moreover, in discussing the insured's argument that he reasonably expected to be covered under the insurance policy, the court commented:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]hen reasonable expectations analysis comes into play, it is more likely to do so when the task is to interpret an ambiguous provision rather than an unambiguous one whose meaning, as in this case, no one disputes. . . . They could not reasonably have expected that leaving the building vacant did not alter the underwriting condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">47 Mass. App. Ct. at 691, 715 N.E.2d at 1048.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither case neatly covers the facts in the case at bar. In both cases no activity was going on in the premises. In Aguiar, at least, the premises were not devoid of contents. It is clear, however, that the court was not equating \"vacant\" with \"abandonment,\" as do some jurisdictions. See, e.g., Jerry v. Kentucky Cent. Ins. Co., 836 S.W.2d 812, 815 (Tex. App. 1992) (\"entire abandonment\"). It is also clear that having the building \"attended\" and \"occupied\" is the central theme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question remains whether this requirement can be satisfied by regular visits and activities, although of relatively brief nature, by someone other than a resident of the building. We are helped by reflecting on the reasons underlying vacancy exclusions. In considering the vacancy exclusion of a policy insuring a warehouse, the Fourth Circuit explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a building is not in use, it is more likely that potential fire hazards will remain undiscovered or unremedied. Chances are also greater that a fire in a vacant building will burn for a longer period and cause greater damage before being detected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Catalina Enter. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 67 F.3d 63, 66 (4th Cir. 1993). Surely, these considerations are even more applicable to one insuring a dwelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we review the undisputed facts of this case, in light of these policy concerns, we can readily see their lack of fit. That is, the approximation to an inhabited abode is not measurably advanced by the motley and sparse inventory of chairs, mattress, and step ladder. Nor does the midday hour or so of work activity convey the appearance of residential living. And random evening visits hardly provide the appearance of somebody being at home or effective anti-vandal protection. The fact is that none of the activities of Mr. Langill or others changed the fact that at the critical and likely times for vandalism and arson, there was no one in the house to discourage, see, or hear marauders, or to hear the activation of smoke detectors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A recent New York case seems both apposite and persuasive. In Lamoureux v. New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 244 A.D.2d 645, 663 N.Y.S.2d 914 (N.Y. App. Div. 1997), the insured building was a one-family residence located adjacent to and behind plaintiff's residence. The premises were destroyed by fire three months after the plaintiff's tenant had moved out. The policy excluded coverage for loss if the building were vacant over 60 consecutive days. Plaintiff's principal challenge to a finding of vacancy was that he was personally renovating the house and was inside the building every day for a couple of hours. The court reversed the trial court's denial of the insurer's motion for summary judgment, \"[g]iving the word vacant its plain and ordinary meaning. . . .\" 244 A.D.2d at 646, 663 N.Y.S.2d at 915. It also ruled that because \"plaintiff himself was never an inhabitant of the premises, the fact that he frequented the premises for the purpose of renovation is not germane to the issue of vacancy.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the Massachusetts courts would similarly rule on the record before us. When we consider the nature of the hazard sought to be guarded against, the sustained presence of a resident, particularly in the hours of darkness, appears logically as the critical factor where the premises are a dwelling. Of course, this also assumes the presence of furnishings and amenities \"minimally necessary for human habitation.\" American Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Durrence, 872 F.2d 378, 379 (11th Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, as this case illustrates, that there is a wide continuum between residency and absolute absence of human presence from the premises. And we do not intend to foreclose the possibility of a set of facts not involving a resident but so paralleling the conditions of residency as to avoid application of the exclusion clause. But we think that in general the multi-factor approach urged by appellant is inconsistent with Massachusetts law. What seems preeminent in this insurance context, for both insurer and insured, is predictability. To the extent that a multi-factor approach is suggested, such as including the presence or absence of tenants, the habitability or absence thereof, the number, nature, duration, and regularity of activities and visits by non-residents, and the proximity of the insured site to the residence, any predictability is fatally compromised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has vigorously invoked dictionary definitions and case law to serve his purpose. As might be suspected, where a host of things can be spoken of as \"vacant,\" from rooms and houses to stores, positions, and expressions, definitions are legion. Appellant has relied on those that stress a space being \"devoid of contents.\" Webster's New World Dictionary, 1968 ed., p. 1606. This is a perfectly good definition but it has been impliedly rejected by Aquiar. Moreover, reference to absence of contents would be more relevant if one were considering whether a warehouse were vacant. The absence of that for which the premises were intended to be used would seem to be the proper object of inquiry. Appellee's choice of another of Webster's definitions seems more of a fit: \"untenanted; not in use, as a room or a house.\" Id. We note as well that the language of the provision, \"whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant,\" directs us to give no special consideration to purpose of the building as one to rented rather than one to be used by appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's reliance on cases illustrates the hazard of focusing on text to the exclusion of context. For example, cases are cited for the proposition that efforts to rehabilitate property preclude a finding of vacancy. See Knight v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 123 Ga. App. 833, 182 S.E.2d 693 (1971); Limbaugh v. Columbia Ins. Co. of N.Y., 368 S.W.2d 921 (Mo. Ct. App. 1963). Knight involved installing new equipment, painting, and making ready a service station and restaurant for reopening and Limbaugh similar activities to ready a recreation hall and package liquor store for opening. In both cases there were policy exclusions if the premises were \"unoccupied\" for sixty days. Knight relied on the reasoning of Limbaugh, in which the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"occupancy\" itself, as used in insurance policies, refers to the presence of persons within the building. This is particularly true as it relates to dwelling houses. They are expected to be places of human habitation where people live and dine and sleep. This cannot be said of a recreation hall and package liquor store, for the nature of the occupancy does not warrant the conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Limbaugh, 368 S.W.2d at 924. The court accordingly held that cleaning and repainting the interior of the liquor store \"would be an activity consistent with its occupation as such.\" Id. at 925.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only does the meaning of \"vacancy\" depend on the type of premises involved, but also the type of insurance policy. Appellant seeks comfort from Ellmex Constr. Co., Inc. v. Republic Ins. Co., 202 N.J. Super. 195, 494 A.2d 339 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1985), which held that the presence in a model home of realtors for four days every week constituted sufficient presence to defeat a thirty day vacancy exclusion clause. But the court noted that the policy involved was a \"builder's risk\" policy, which should not be interpreted as are policies insuring ordinary homeowners. 202 N.J. Super. at 204, 494 A.2d at 344. The latter policies, observed the court, \"may, and usually do, require the insured dwelling to be occupied as a place of abode.\" 202 N.J. Super. at 203-04, 494 A.2d at 343. It consequently felt free to depart from this standard and, resolving ambiguity against the insurer, held that defendant had not required that the premises be \"occupied\" twenty-four hours per day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is important to distinguish cases according wide elasticity to the word \"occupancy,\" after finding the word ambiguous and construing the term in favor of the insured. See Smith v. Lumbermen's Mut. Ins. Co., 101 Mich. App. 78, 300 N.W.2d 457 (1981); Drummond v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 343 S.W.2d 84 (Mo. Ct. App. 1960). In Smith, the court held that where the insurer knew that a dwelling was under a contract of sale, a temporary vacancy pending arrival of the new resident-owner was \"not within the vacancy clause, absent a clear expression of intent in the insurance policy.\" 101 Mich. App. at 86, 300 N.W.2d at 460. Likewise, in Drummond the court, relying on early precedent, held that the presence of a caretaker one day and night each week during the specified vacancy period constituted \"possessio pedis\" and was sufficient. 343 S.W.2d at 87. Suffice it to say that neither case would be considered relevant in interpreting the mandatory vacancy provision under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the time, Mass.

In affirming the trial court's ruling that the property had been vacant for the required period, the appeals court \"illuminated why an insurer would be concerned about an unoccupied building\" by explaining that arsonists had attempted to destroy the building several times in the months before they ultimately succeeded. 47 Mass. App. Ct. at 689, 715 N.E.2d at 1047. Moreover, in discussing the insured's argument that he reasonably expected to be covered under the insurance policy, the court commented:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]hen reasonable expectations analysis comes into play, it is more likely to do so when the task is to interpret an ambiguous provision rather than an unambiguous one whose meaning, as in this case, no one disputes. . . . They could not reasonably have expected that leaving the building vacant did not alter the underwriting condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">47 Mass. App. Ct. at 691, 715 N.E.2d at 1048.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither case neatly covers the facts in the case at bar. In both cases no activity was going on in the premises. In Aguiar, at least, the premises were not devoid of contents. It is clear, however, that the court was not equating \"vacant\" with \"abandonment,\" as do some jurisdictions. See, e.g., Jerry v. Kentucky Cent. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1653159\"><a href=\"/opinion/1653159/jerry-v-kentucky-cent-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>, 815 (Tex. App. 1992) (\"entire abandonment\"). It is also clear that having the building \"attended\" and \"occupied\" is the central theme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question remains whether this requirement can be satisfied by regular visits and activities, although of relatively brief nature, by someone other than a resident of the building. We are helped by reflecting on the reasons underlying vacancy exclusions. In considering the vacancy exclusion of a policy insuring a warehouse, the Fourth Circuit explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a building is not in use, it is more likely that potential fire hazards will remain undiscovered or unremedied. Chances are also greater that a fire in a vacant building will burn for a longer period and cause greater damage before being detected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Catalina Enter. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></span>, 66 (4th Cir. 1993). Surely, these considerations are even more applicable to one insuring a dwelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When we review the undisputed facts of this case, in light of these policy concerns, we can readily see their lack of fit. That is, the approximation to an inhabited abode is not measurably advanced by the motley and sparse inventory of chairs, mattress, and step ladder. Nor does the midday hour or so of work activity convey the appearance of residential living. And random evening visits hardly provide the appearance of somebody being at home or effective anti-vandal protection. The fact is that none of the activities of Mr. Langill or others changed the fact that at the critical and likely times for vandalism and arson, there was no one in the house to discourage, see, or hear marauders, or to hear the activation of smoke detectors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A recent New York case seems both apposite and persuasive. In Lamoureux v. New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">645</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">914</span></span> (N.Y. App. Div. 1997), the insured building was a one-family residence located adjacent to and behind plaintiff's residence. The premises were destroyed by fire three months after the plaintiff's tenant had moved out. The policy excluded coverage for loss if the building were vacant over 60 consecutive days. Plaintiff's principal challenge to a finding of vacancy was that he was personally renovating the house and was inside the building every day for a couple of hours. The court reversed the trial court's denial of the insurer's motion for summary judgment, \"[g]iving the word vacant its plain and ordinary meaning. . . .\" 244 A.D.2d at 646, 663 N.Y.S.2d at 915. It also ruled that because \"plaintiff himself was never an inhabitant of the premises, the fact that he frequented the premises for the purpose of renovation is not germane to the issue of vacancy.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the Massachusetts courts would similarly rule on the record before us. When we consider the nature of the hazard sought to be guarded against, the sustained presence of a resident, particularly in the hours of darkness, appears logically as the critical factor where the premises are a dwelling. Of course, this also assumes the presence of furnishings and amenities \"minimally necessary for human habitation.\" American Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Durrence, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"521126\"><a href=\"/opinion/521126/american-mutual-fire-insurance-company-v-mildred-durrence/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span>, 379 (11th Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize, as this case illustrates, that there is a wide continuum between residency and absolute absence of human presence from the premises. And we do not intend to foreclose the possibility of a set of facts not involving a resident but so paralleling the conditions of residency as to avoid application of the exclusion clause. But we think that in general the multi-factor approach urged by appellant is inconsistent with Massachusetts law. What seems preeminent in this insurance context, for both insurer and insured, is predictability. To the extent that a multi-factor approach is suggested, such as including the presence or absence of tenants, the habitability or absence thereof, the number, nature, duration, and regularity of activities and visits by non-residents, and the proximity of the insured site to the residence, any predictability is fatally compromised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant has vigorously invoked dictionary definitions and case law to serve his purpose. As might be suspected, where a host of things can be spoken of as \"vacant,\" from rooms and houses to stores, positions, and expressions, definitions are legion. Appellant has relied on those that stress a space being \"devoid of contents.\" Webster's New World Dictionary, 1968 ed., p. 1606. This is a perfectly good definition but it has been impliedly rejected by Aquiar. Moreover, reference to absence of contents would be more relevant if one were considering whether a warehouse were vacant. The absence of that for which the premises were intended to be used would seem to be the proper object of inquiry. Appellee's choice of another of Webster's definitions seems more of a fit: \"untenanted; not in use, as a room or a house.\" Id. We note as well that the language of the provision, \"whether intended for occupancy by owner or tenant,\" directs us to give no special consideration to purpose of the building as one to rented rather than one to be used by appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's reliance on cases illustrates the hazard of focusing on text to the exclusion of context. For example, cases are cited for the proposition that efforts to rehabilitate property preclude a finding of vacancy. See Knight v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1329698\"><a href=\"/opinion/1329698/knight-v-us-fidelity-guaranty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ga. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1329698\"><a href=\"/opinion/1329698/knight-v-us-fidelity-guaranty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span> (1971); Limbaugh v. Columbia Ins. Co. of N.Y., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1532735\"><a href=\"/opinion/1532735/limbaugh-v-columbia-insurance-co-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></a></span> (Mo. Ct. App. 1963). Knight involved installing new equipment, painting, and making ready a service station and restaurant for reopening and Limbaugh similar activities to ready a recreation hall and package liquor store for opening. In both cases there were policy exclusions if the premises were \"unoccupied\" for sixty days. Knight relied on the reasoning of Limbaugh, in which the court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The word \"occupancy\" itself, as used in insurance policies, refers to the presence of persons within the building. This is particularly true as it relates to dwelling houses. They are expected to be places of human habitation where people live and dine and sleep. This cannot be said of a recreation hall and package liquor store, for the nature of the occupancy does not warrant the conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Limbaugh, 368 S.W.2d at 924. The court accordingly held that cleaning and repainting the interior of the liquor store \"would be an activity consistent with its occupation as such.\" Id. at 925.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only does the meaning of \"vacancy\" depend on the type of premises involved, but also the type of insurance policy. Appellant seeks comfort from Ellmex Constr. Co., Inc. v. Republic Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2381124\"><a href=\"/opinion/2381124/ellmex-const-co-inc-v-republic-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">202</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.

Super. Ct. App. Div. 1985), which held that the presence in a model home of realtors for four days every week constituted sufficient presence to defeat a thirty day vacancy exclusion clause. But the court noted that the policy involved was a \"builder's risk\" policy, which should not be interpreted as are policies insuring ordinary homeowners. 202 N.J. Super. at 204, 494 A.2d at 344. The latter policies, observed the court, \"may, and usually do, require the insured dwelling to be occupied as a place of abode.\" 202 N.J. Super. at 203-04, 494 A.2d at 343. It consequently felt free to depart from this standard and, resolving ambiguity against the insurer, held that defendant had not required that the premises be \"occupied\" twenty-four hours per day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, it is important to distinguish cases according wide elasticity to the word \"occupancy,\" after finding the word ambiguous and construing the term in favor of the insured. See Smith v. Lumbermen's Mut. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></span> (1981); Drummond v. Hartford Fire Ins.

Ct. App. 1960). In Smith, the court held that where the insurer knew that a dwelling was under a contract of sale, a temporary vacancy pending arrival of the new resident-owner was \"not within the vacancy clause, absent a clear expression of intent in the insurance policy.\" 101 Mich. App. at 86, 300 N.W.2d at 460. Likewise, in Drummond the court, relying on early precedent, held that the presence of a caretaker one day and night each week during the specified vacancy period constituted \"possessio pedis\" and was sufficient. 343 S.W.2d at 87. Suffice it to say that neither case would be considered relevant in interpreting the mandatory vacancy provision under Massachusetts law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the time, Mass.
