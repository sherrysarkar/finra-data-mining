On de  novo review of the issues, we\r                                                \r\n\nagree  that  plaintiff's    1983  claims  are  barred by  the\r\n\nborrowed  three-year   state  limitations  period   for  tort\r\n\nactions.   The complaint seeks monetary  damages arising from\r\n\nthe application  to plaintiff's  skin of a  chemical solution\r\n\ncontaining ortho-tolidine, a  potential carcinogen, during an\r\n\ninvestigatory search  for the presence of  occult (invisible)\r\n\nblood.  Plaintiff alleges  Fourth Amendment, due process, and\r\n\nother constitutional violations arising from the skin search,\r\n\nwhich  was  conducted in  August, 1988.    He does  not claim\r\n\ninjury nor damages arising from his later criminal conviction\r\n\nand  imprisonment.   Thus  the    1983  claims stated  in the\r\n\ncomplaint accrued on the date that the search was  conducted,\r\n\nand  this  complaint,  filed  almost five  years  later,  was\r\n\nuntimely.  See McIntosh v. Antonio, 71 F.3d 29, 34  (1st Cir.\r                                              \r\n\n1995).     While   the  magistrate's   opinion  raises   some\r\n\ninteresting questions about how  a court might handle similar\r\n\nclaims filed  during the pendency of  parallel state criminal\r\n\nproceedings, we  need not reach those  questions because this\r\n\ncomplaint  was filed  well  after the  state proceedings  had\r\n\nconcluded. \r\n\n          Plaintiff's allegation that he did not learn of the\r\n\nlatent effects of ortho-tolidine until October 30, 1992, does\r\n\nnot affect the accrual  date.  The gravamen of  plaintiff's  \r\n\n1983 claims is not a medical injury but the alleged injury to\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nhis constitutional rights  based on  the ortho-tolidine  skin\r\n\nsearch.  It is beyond  dispute that when the skin  search was\r\n\nconducted plaintiff had sufficient notice of all of the facts\r\n\nnecessary to  alert him to a  possible constitutional injury,\r\n\nas further demonstrated by  his assertion of Fourth Amendment\r\n\nmotions  to suppress the test results  in his criminal trial.\r\n\nThrough reasonable diligence during the limitations period he\r\n\ncould  have discovered the  facts which  he states  were then\r\n\nwell known in scientific  circles, and on which he  now seeks\r\n\nto  predicate  additional constitutional  injury  and damage.\r\n\nSee Marrapese v. State, 749 F.2d 934, 937-38 (1st Cir. 1984),\r                                  \r\n\ncert. denied, 474 U.S. 921 (1985).    \r                        \r\n\n          Accordingly,  the judgment  below is  affirmed and,\r                                                                    \r\n\nas  no federal  issues remain,  the judgment  is modified  to\r                                                                     \r\n\nindicate that the pendent  state claims are dismissed without\r\n\nprejudice for lack of jurisdiction.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
