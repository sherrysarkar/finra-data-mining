Hunger, Assistant Attorney  General, Brenda E.  Ellison,\r                                                                             \r\nSenior  Litigation  Counsel,  Office  of Immigration  Litigation,  and\r\nErnesto H. Molina, Jr., Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation.\r                              \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per  Curiam.  After careful review of the record and the\r                            \r\n\npetition for  review,  we  find  no  reason  to  reverse  the\r\n\ndecision of the BIA.  Accordingly, we affirm, essentially for\r\n\nthe  reasons  stated  in   that  decision,  adding  only  the\r\n\nfollowing comments.\r\n\n     1.   We   assume,  without   deciding,   that  we   have\r\n\njurisdiction to  hear this petition.   See Anti-Terrorism and\r                                                      \r\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act, Public Law No. 104-132,   440(a)\r\n\n(to be codified at 8 U.S.C.   1105(a)(10)).\r\n\n     2.  The BIA  considered all the evidence,  made specific\r\n\nfindings  as to both  the positive and  negative factors, and\r\n\nexplained  how it  reached  the  decision  that  petitioner's\r\n\noutstanding   equities  (long  residence,  family  ties,  and\r\n\nrehabilitation  efforts)  were  outweighed  by  his extensive\r\n\ncriminal  history.    The grant  or  denial  of  a waiver  of\r\n\ndeportation  remains a  matter  of BIA  discretion, and  this\r\n\ncourt will not \"second-guess the Board on the manner in which\r\n\nit weights  different factors  when arriving at  its ultimate\r\n\ndecision.\"   See Gouveia v. INS, 980  F.2d 814, 819 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1992).\r\n\n     3.   Petitioner argues in essence  that he was \"merely a\r\n\nminor  drug peddlar\" and not  a \"drug trafficker,\"  and so he\r\n\nshould not  have been required to  show outstanding equities.\r\n\nSee Elramly v. INS, 73  F.3d 220, 223 (9th Cir.  1995), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ngranted, 116 S.Ct.  1260 (1996).   To the  contrary, the  BIA\r                   \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ndecision  shows it considered petitioner's extensive criminal\r\n\nhistory  in   detail  in   determining  that  a   showing  of\r\n\noutstanding equities was required.\r\n\n     4.   There  is  no   record  support  for   petitioner's\r\n\nassertion that he was not notified  at that time of his  drug\r\n\nsentencing about  any immigration consequences that  he might\r\n\nface.    In any  event, petitioner conceded  the grounds  for\r\n\ndeportation  before the  immigration  judge, and  he may  not\r\n\nchallenge   the  validity  of   his  drug  conviction  during\r\n\nimmigration proceedings.  See Gouveia, 980 F.2d at 817.\r                                                 \r\n\n     5.   Finally,  we  reject  petitioner's   argument  that\r\n\ndeportation,  a   civil  proceeding,  is  cruel  and  unusual\r\n\npunishment.  See Hernandez-Rivera v. INS, 630 F.2d 1352, 1356\r                                                    \r\n\n(9th Cir. 1980).\r\n\n     There  being  no  substantial  question for  review,  we\r\n\nsummarily affirm the decision of the BIA and deny and dismiss\r                                                                         \r\n\nthe petition for review.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                                         \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
