Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                     Stahl, Circuit Judge,\n         Campbell and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Raymond L. Gary on brief pro se.\n     Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Donald C.\nLockhart and Gerard B. Sullivan, Assistant United States\nAttorneys, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          February 2, 2001\n\f            Per Curiam. Raymond J. Gary appeals pro se from the\n\ndenial of his 28 U.S.S. § 2255 petition as untimely given\n\nthe one-year time limit imposed by the Antiterrorism and\n\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\").           Passing the\n\nquestion whether the time limits of amended § 2255 are\n\nsubject to equitable tolling, we affirm essentially for the\n\nreasons stated by the district court.         We add the following\n\ncomments to address arguments pressed on appeal.\n\n            Gary suggests that the one-year time limitation\n\nshould be equitably tolled because he was \"misled\" by Lindh\n\nv. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320 (1997) into thinking that the AEDPA\n\ndoes not apply where, as here, the underlying criminal case\n\nwas initiated pre-AEDPA.          This argument fails.       First,\n\nGary's interpretation of Lindh is not reasonable.          Cf. Green\n\nv.   White, 223 F.3d 1001, 1003 (9th Cir. 2000) (denying\n\nequitable    tolling      where   reliance    on   Lindh   was     not\n\nreasonable).       Second, Gary's reliance argument is largely\n\nundercut by the fact that Lindh was decided only one day\n\nbefore his § 2255 petition was due.\n\n            Gary   also   suggests   that    equitable   tolling    is\n\nwarranted because his attorney gave him misleading advice to\n\nthe effect that he had \"plenty of time\" and should wait\n\nuntil he reached his final destination before sending for\n\fhis record.       This argument fails if for no reason than that\n\nattorney     error      does    not,    as    a     general   rule,     warrant\n\nequitable tolling.             See, e.g., Kreutzer v. Bowersox, 231\n\nF.3d 460, 463 (8th Cir. 2000) (counsel's confusion about\n\nAEDPA's time limit does not warrant equitable tolling);\n\nSandvik v. United States, 177 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.\n\n1999) (denying equitable tolling where § 2255 petition was\n\nlate because attorney used regular mail).\n\n             As for Gary's suggestion that equitable tolling is\n\nwarranted because his counsel intended to deceive him, this\n\nargument is arguably waived.             In his factual proffer below,\n\nGary   did      not   aver   that   counsel        acted   from   an   improper\n\nmotive.      In any event, the argument fails on the proffered\n\nfacts.     There is no suggestion in Gary's affidavit that he\n\nindicated to counsel a desire to collaterally attack his\n\nconviction until sometime after the time limit expired.\n\nRather, during the relevant period, Gary and his attorney\n\ndiscussed Gary's desire to get federal credit for time\n\nserved     in     state      custody.         In    the    context     of   this\n\nconversation, counsel's advice seems appropriate.\n\n             Finally, Gary proffers copies of letters in which\n\nhe requests his former counsel to send his record.                          These\n\nletters were not submitted below.                  Even if we could properly\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fconsider this material (and we cannot), see United States v.\n\nKobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 457 (1st Cir. 1983) (evidentiary\n\nmatters not first presented to the district court are not\n\nproperly before us), it would not alter the outcome.     The\n\nletters go to the question whether Gary was unable to file\n\na timely § 2255 petition due to the fact that he did not\n\nhave necessary parts of the record, and, if so, whether he\n\nwas diligent in seeking his case file from his attorney.\n\nThe letters are some evidence that Gary was diligent late in\n\nthe game, when the time limit had already expired.   However,\n\nthey do not show him to have been diligent during the\n\nrelevant period.   In fact, during the relevant period Gary\n\nsimply acquiesced in his attorney's suggestion that he wait\n\nuntil he reach his final destination before sending for his\n\nrecord.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -4-\n\f",
