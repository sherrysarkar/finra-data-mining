Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Bownes and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Robert E.

The district court in this case\n\nentered a controversial (and arguably incorrect) judgment.         See\n\nKarak v. Bursaw Oil Corp., 147 F. Supp. 2d 9 (D. Mass. 2001).      The\n\ndefendant eschewed an appeal.    Later, he moved for relief from the\n\njudgment on grounds of newly discovered evidence, Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n60(b)(2), and misrepresentation, Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(3).         The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion.        Finding that ruling free from\n\nany abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n                              Background\n\n            The facts that give rise to the underlying litigation are\n\nchronicled in the district court's original opinion, see Karak, 147\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 10-11, and it would be pleonastic to repeat them\n\nhere.    For present purposes, it suffices to say that, at the times\n\nrelevant hereto, defendant-appellee Bursaw Oil Corp. (a wholesaler\n\nand distributor of motor fuel and allied products), through a\n\nsubsidiary, owned a prime service station in Newton, Massachusetts.\n\nBeginning in 1989, plaintiff-appellant Elie N. Karak leased this\n\nstation and sold, inter alia, gasoline supplied by Bursaw.1        The\n\nparties' relationship was bounded by several agreements, revised\n\nand renewed periodically, which covered both the lease of the real\n\n\n\n     1\n      There are two plaintiffs here (Karak and a corporation that\nhe controls) and two defendants (Bursaw and its parent company).\nFor ease in reference, we treat the case as if Karak and Bursaw\nwere the sole parties in interest.\n\n                                 -2-\n\festate and the supply of motor fuel.                  The last lease renewal\n\nexpired on June 30, 2000.            Karak nonetheless remained on the\n\npremises as a tenant at will, and Bursaw continued to supply the\n\nstation with motor fuel.\n\n            On   or   about    February    20,   2001,   Karak   learned      from\n\nBursaw's general manager, Andrew Slifka, that Bursaw planned to\n\nsell the station to a third party.           With that objective in mind,\n\nBursaw served notice on March 28, 2001, directing Karak to vacate\n\nthe premises within thirty days.          Karak did not go quietly; as the\n\nthirty-day period wound down, he brought suit against Bursaw in the\n\nfederal district court.        His suit premised federal jurisdiction on\n\nthe existence of a federal question, see 28 U.S.C. § 1331, charging\n\nBursaw with having violated the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act\n\n(PMPA), 15 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2841.\n\n            Concerned    about    possession     of    the   premises   and   his\n\nability to keep his business afloat, Karak immediately moved for\n\ninjunctive relief.       The district court treated his motion as a\n\nmotion for a temporary restraining order and denied it on April 30,\n\n2001.     Two days later, Karak filed an amended complaint and a\n\nrenewed    request    for     preliminary    injunctive      relief.     Bursaw\n\nresponded by filing a motion to dismiss and an opposition to the\n\nprayer for injunctive relief.             As part of its response, Bursaw\n\nattached affidavits subscribed by Slifka and Edward Davis (Bursaw's\n\noperations manager).\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          The district court held a hearing on May 10 in respect to\n\nKarak's motion for a preliminary injunction.    The court then took\n\nthe matter under advisement, directing the parties to supplement\n\nthe record. Pursuant to this directive, Karak swore out and served\n\nan affidavit, and Bursaw filed four affidavits of company officials\n\n(including supplementary declarations from Slifka and Davis).\n\n          On May 30, 2001, the district court denied Karak's motion\n\nfor injunctive relief and dismissed the action for want of federal\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.   Karak, 147 F. Supp. 2d at 15.    The\n\ncourt's decision rested on two determinations:        (1) that the\n\nidiosyncratic relationship between the parties did not fall within\n\nthe scope of the PMPA, and (2) that it should not exercise\n\nsupplemental jurisdiction over Karak's pendent state-law claims.\n\nId. at 15-16.\n\n          Karak abjured an appeal.   Instead, he filed a strikingly\n\nsimilar suit in a Massachusetts state court. That court too denied\n\nKarak's pleas for injunctive relief.      Karak then abandoned his\n\nstate court action and returned to the federal court.    This time,\n\nhe filed what he termed a \"motion to reconsider\" (in reality, a\n\nmotion for relief from judgment).2   The motion invoked Fed. R. Civ.\n\n\n     2\n      Karak filed this motion on June 27, 2001. As final judgment\nhad entered in the district court on May 31, 2001, the appeal\nperiod was still open. See Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Despite\nthis window of opportunity, Karak again eschewed a direct appeal.\n\n     At about this same time, Karak stipulated to the entry of\njudgment in yet a third case — an eviction proceeding that Bursaw\n\n                               -4-\n\fP. 60(b)(2)-(3) and incorporated affidavits from Karak's attorney,\n\nRichard P. Blaustein, and from a former Bursaw employee, Edward\n\nYaeger.    For eleven years, Yaeger had supervised the Karak-Bursaw\n\nrelationship,      and     he    had     great    familiarity       both     with    that\n\nrelationship      and     with    Bursaw's       corporate      hierarchy.          Yaeger\n\nclaimed, inter alia, that Davis had misrepresented the structure of\n\nthe company, and that both Davis and Slifka had distorted the\n\nnature of Bursaw's dealings with Karak.                  Karak asserted that this\n\naffidavit       constituted       new,     previously         undiscovered      evidence\n\nsupporting his position, and that it proved the falsity of Bursaw's\n\nrepresentations to the district court.\n\n            Bursaw        strenuously       opposed       this     motion.            More\n\nimportantly, the district court found it wanting and summarily\n\ndenied it.      This appeal followed.\n\n                                           II.\n\n                                         Analysis\n\n            \"In    our    adversary       system    of   justice,       each    litigant\n\nremains under an abiding duty to take the legal steps that are\n\nnecessary to protect his or her own interests.\"                        Cotto v. United\n\nStates, 993 F.2d 274, 278 (1st Cir. 1993).                     Given this duty, the\n\nfailure to take a timely appeal has serious consequences.                        While a\n\nmotion    for    relief    from    judgment       can    be    filed    under   certain\n\n\nhad brought in a state district court.     Under the terms of the\nstipulation, Karak agreed to vacate the service station premises no\nlater than July 17, 2001.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fcircumstances, an appeal from the denial of such a motion will not\n\nexpose the merits of the underlying judgment to appellate scrutiny.\n\nSee id.; Ojeda-Toro v. Rivera-Mendez, 853 F.2d 25, 28-29 (1st Cir.\n\n1988); see also Rodriguez-Antuna v. Chase Manhattan Bank Corp., 871\n\nF.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1989) (explaining that the appeal from a denial\n\nof a Rule 60(b) motion \"does not automatically produce a Lazarus-\n\nlike effect; it cannot resurrect appellants' expired right to\n\ncontest the merits of the underlying judgment, nor bring the\n\njudgment itself before us for review\").    In short, an appeal from\n\nthe denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is not a surrogate for a\n\nseasonable appeal of the underlying judgment.\n\n          In view of this paradigm, the merits of the district\n\ncourt's original order are not now in issue.    To the contrary, the\n\nonly justiciable question on this appeal involves the propriety of\n\nthe lower court's denial of Karak's Rule 60(b) motion. Our inquiry\n\ninto that question proceeds on the understanding that relief under\n\nRule 60(b) is extraordinary in nature and that motions invoking\n\nthat rule should be granted sparingly.    See Teamsters, Chauffeurs,\n\nWarehousemen & Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp.\n\nCo., 953 F.2d 17, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1992);    Lepore v. Vidockler, 792\n\nF.2d 272, 274 (1st Cir. 1986).    Thus, a party who seeks recourse\n\nunder Rule 60(b) must persuade the trial court, at a bare minimum,\n\nthat his motion is timely; that exceptional circumstances exist,\n\nfavoring extraordinary relief; that if the judgment is set aside,\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fhe has the right stuff to mount a potentially meritorious claim or\n\ndefense; and that no unfair prejudice will accrue to the opposing\n\nparties should the motion be granted.        Teamsters, 953 F.2d at 20-\n\n21.\n\n            On appeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion, the\n\nmovant faces a further hurdle. The district court typically has an\n\nintimate, first-hand knowledge of the case, and, thus, is best\n\npositioned to determine whether the justification proffered in\n\nsupport of a Rule 60(b) motion should serve to override the\n\nopposing party's rights and the law's institutional interest in\n\nfinality.    Consequently, we defer broadly to the district court's\n\ninformed discretion in granting or denying relief from judgment,\n\nand we review its ruling solely for abuse of that discretion.\n\nClaremont Flock Corp. v. Alm, 281 F.3d 297, 299 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nTeamsters, 953 F.2d at 19.\n\n                                  A.\n\n                             Rule 60(b)(2)\n\n            Against this backdrop, we turn first to Karak's attempt\n\nto invoke Rule 60(b)(2). That rule provides in pertinent part that\n\nthe trial court may relieve a party from a final judgment on the\n\nbasis of \"newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could\n\nnot have been discovered [within ten days of the date of the\n\njudgment.]\"   On this record, we cannot disturb either the district\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fcourt's assessment of these criteria or its decision to deny\n\nrelief.\n\n           Although     Karak   touts    the   Yaeger    affidavit    as   newly\n\ndiscovered evidence, he wholly fails to explain why this evidence\n\ncould not have been found, well before the entry of judgment, in\n\nthe   exercise    of   even   minimal    diligence.        The   inference    of\n\navailability seems compelling.          Yaeger — although retired from his\n\nposition at Bursaw — lived in nearby Lynn, Massachusetts.                  Karak\n\nhad dealt with him for many years and knew him intimately.                 On the\n\nface of things, the delay in contacting Yaeger appears to doom\n\nKarak's current quest.        See, e.g., Washington v. Patlis, 916 F.2d\n\n1036, 1038 (5th Cir. 1990) (affirming trial court's denial of Rule\n\n60(b)(2) motion when movant knew of her \"newly discovered\" witness\n\nat the time she filed her complaint, but did not attempt to present\n\nthat witness until after entry of judgment).\n\n           Of course, appearances can be deceiving.              Cf. Aesop, The\n\nWolf in Sheep's Clothing (circa 550 B.C.).              But a party who seeks\n\nrelief from a judgment based on newly discovered evidence must, at\n\nthe very least, offer a convincing explanation as to why he could\n\nnot have proffered the crucial evidence at an earlier stage of the\n\nproceedings.     See Lepore, 792 F.2d at 274.            Karak did not carry\n\nthis burden:     he himself eschewed any attempt to explain the delay\n\nin adducing Yaeger's version of the facts, and the Yaeger affidavit\n\nprovided nothing suggesting that Yaeger was unavailable during the\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fweeks leading up to the entry of judgment.   Indeed, the only effort\n\nthat Karak made to persuade the district court that Yaeger's\n\nevidence was beyond his reach was to file an affidavit from his\n\nthen-counsel (Blaustein).\n\n          The Blaustein affidavit is scarcely worth the paper on\n\nwhich it is typed.     Other than parroting the language of Rule\n\n60(b)(2),3 Blaustein stated only that he did not know about Yaeger\n\nuntil June 23, 2001.   That statement, even if true, is beside the\n\npoint.   The relevant standard is not whether a plaintiff told his\n\nattorney about a particular witness, but, rather, whether someone\n\non the plaintiff's side of the case (be it the plaintiff or his\n\nattorney) knew of the witness.       See Parrilla-Lopez v. United\n\nStates, 841 F.2d 16, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1988).    Taking the record as\n\na whole, Karak not only must have known of the witness (Yaeger) but\n\nalso must have appreciated his likely significance.     Thus, Karak\n\nhas failed to undermine the logical inference that he had ample\n\ntime and opportunity to secure and present the Yaeger affidavit\n\nprior to the initial entry of judgment.\n\n           Karak endeavors to blunt the force of this reasoning by\n\nbemoaning that the case moved at lightning speed, thus depriving\n\n\n\n     3\n      We disregard the chanting of this mantra. Although a court,\nfor purposes of a Rule 60(b) motion, sometimes may assume the truth\nof fact-specific statements proffered by the movant, it need not\ncredit \"bald assertions, unsubstantiated conclusions, periphrastic\ncircumlocutions, or hyperbolic rodomontade.\" Teamsters, 953 F.2d\nat 18.\n\n                               -9-\n\fhim of a fair chance to marshal his proof.               This is little more\n\nthan a post hoc rationalization.             After all, it was Karak who\n\ndictated the pace of the proceedings by pressing vigorously for\n\npreliminary     injunctive   relief        (which   he    termed   \"emergency\"\n\ninjunctive relief).     Moreover, when the district court requested\n\nsupplementary materials in connection with the motion to dismiss,\n\nKarak   could   have   sought    time   for    discovery     or    for   further\n\ninvestigation.     Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).            He elected not to do\n\nso.   Having decided to proceed full throttle, Karak hardly can be\n\nheard to complain that the district court obliged him by moving\n\nexpeditiously.\n\n           To sum up, Karak failed to show that, had he exercised\n\ndue diligence, Yaeger's affidavit would not have been available\n\nearlier.   Given this failing, the district court did not abuse its\n\nwide discretion in denying the motion for relief from judgment\n\ninsofar as that motion implicated Rule 60(b)(2).              See Lepore, 792\n\nF.2d at 274 (\"An unexcused failure to produce the relevant evidence\n\nbefore the entry of judgment is sufficient grounds for denial of a\n\n60(b) motion.\").\n\n                                      B.\n\n                                Rule 60(b)(3)\n\n           The second prong of Karak's argument suggests that his\n\nmotion for relief from judgment should have been granted under the\n\naegis of Rule 60(b)(3). That rule authorizes the district court to\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fabsolve a party from a final judgment upon a showing that the\n\nadverse party has committed \"fraud (whether heretofore denominated\n\nintrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct .\n\n. . .\"      There are two prerequisites to obtaining redress under this\n\nrule.       First, the movant must demonstrate misconduct — such as\n\nfraud or misrepresentation — by clear and convincing evidence.\n\nAnderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862 F.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\nSecond, the movant must \"show that the misconduct foreclosed full\n\nand fair preparation or presentation of [his] case.\"                 Id.\n\n               Karak's theory is that the Yaeger affidavit proves that\n\nSlifka's and Davis's affidavits contained material misstatements,\n\nand that those misstatements evince misconduct on Bursaw's part.\n\nThis       theory   is   far   from   watertight.   For      one   thing,   Karak\n\noverstates the degree to which the Yaeger affidavit contradicts the\n\nSlifka and Davis affidavits.4             For another thing, Karak himself\n\nknew most of the pertinent information contained in the Yaeger\n\naffidavit       (e.g.,     information      concerning       the   division    of\n\nresponsibilities between Karak and Bursaw during their working\n\nrelationship). Finally, Yaeger's affidavit, even when read through\n\nrose-colored        glasses,    merely    establishes    a    conflict   in   the\n\n\n\n       4\n      To cite but one glaring example, Karak contrasts Yaeger's\ntestimony that Bursaw had two divisions dealing with gasoline sales\nto the public with Davis's testimony that Bursaw maintained three\ntypes of \"relationships\" with its affiliated service stations.\nAlthough Karak makes much of this \"misrepresentation,\" we see no\nnecessary inconsistency in these descriptions.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fevidence; it does not clearly and convincingly show that Slifka and\n\nDavis, at Bursaw's instance, intentionally misrepresented pertinent\n\nfacts. The former showing, without the latter, is not enough.          See\n\nGeo. P. Reintjes Co. v. Riley Stoker Corp., 71 F.3d 44, 49 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (holding that a showing of perjury, without more, is\n\ninsufficient to entitle a party to relief from judgment under Rule\n\n60(b)(3)).\n\n            In all events, we need not probe too deeply whether Karak\n\nmade an adequate showing of misconduct. Even assuming that he did,\n\nany misstatements that may have occurred did not inhibit him from\n\nfully and fairly preparing his case.         We explain briefly.\n\n             To meet the second requirement for application of Rule\n\n60(b)(3),     the   asserted    misconduct   \"must   substantially    have\n\ninterfered with the aggrieved party's ability fully and fairly to\n\nprepare for and proceed [to judgment].\"        Anderson, 862 F.2d at 924\n\n(emphasis in original).        The burden is on the movant to make this\n\nshowing.     But the Blaustein affidavit contains no claim that any\n\nsuch interference occurred, and Karak nowhere persuasively explains\n\nwhat interference transpired.\n\n             The absence of such an explanation is fatal, as the\n\ncircumstances of the case, unexplained, do not support an inference\n\nof substantial interference.       After all, Karak had at his beck and\n\ncall the complete panoply of pretrial discovery devices, including\n\ndeposition notices and demands for document production.            He also\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fhad access to Yaeger, had he chosen to take advantage of that\n\nopportunity in a timely fashion.                    See supra Part II(A).          Karak\n\navailed himself of none of these measures.                   Had he done so, common\n\nsense       suggests        that   he   easily      could    have     discovered     any\n\nmisstatements and laid bare the facts prior to the entry of\n\njudgment.\n\n              This is not a case like Anderson, in which a defendant\n\nallegedly concealed evidence during pretrial discovery.                      862 F.2d\n\nat 922-23.       Bursaw made no bones about the fact that Slifka and\n\nDavis were its key witnesses, and did not in any way obstruct\n\nKarak's ability to depose them or to inspect its corporate records.\n\nWhen    a    party     is    capable    of    fully    and   fairly    preparing     and\n\npresenting his case notwithstanding the adverse party's arguable\n\nmisconduct, the trial court is free to deny relief under Rule\n\n60(b)(3).      See Diaz v. Methodist Hosp., 46 F.3d 492, 497 (5th Cir.\n\n1995).      So is it here:         while one can debate the extent to which\n\nYaeger's version of the facts differs from Slifka's and Davis's,\n\nand which of those versions is more credible, one cannot plausibly\n\ncontend, on this record, that Karak's pursuit of the truth was\n\nhampered by anything except his own reluctance to undertake an\n\nassiduous investigation (including pretrial discovery).\n\n              That ends the matter.

Bursaw Oil Corp.,</i> 147 F.Supp.2d 9 (D.Mass.2001). The plaintiff eschewed an appeal. Later, he moved for relief from the judgment on grounds of newly discovered evidence, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2), and misrepresentation, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). The district court denied the motion. Finding that ruling free from any abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts that give rise to the underlying litigation are chronicled in the district court's original opinion, <i>see Karak,</i> 147 F.Supp.2d at 10-11, and it would be pleonastic to repeat them here. For present purposes, it suffices to say that, at the times relevant hereto, defendant-appellee Bursaw Oil Corp. (a wholesaler and distributor of motor fuel and allied products), through a subsidiary, owned a prime service station in Newton, Massachusetts. Beginning in 1989, plaintiff-appellant Elie N. Karak leased this station and sold, inter alia, gasoline supplied by Bursaw.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The parties' relationship was bounded by several agreements, revised and renewed periodically, which covered both the lease of the real estate and the supply of motor fuel. The last lease renewal expired on June 30, 2000. Karak nonetheless remained on the premises as a tenant at will, and Bursaw continued to supply the station with motor fuel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about February 20, 2001, Karak learned from Bursaw's general manager, Andrew Slifka, that Bursaw planned to sell the station to a third party. With that objective in mind, Bursaw served notice on March 28, 2001, directing Karak to vacate the premises within thirty days. Karak did not go quietly; as the thirty-day period wound down, he brought suit against Bursaw in the federal district court. His suit premised federal jurisdiction on the existence of a federal question, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, charging Bursaw with having violated the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (PMPA), 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2801-2841.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned about possession of the premises and his ability to keep his business afloat, Karak immediately moved for injunctive relief. The district court treated his motion as a motion for a temporary restraining order and denied it on April 30, 2001. Two days later, Karak filed an amended complaint and a renewed request for preliminary injunctive relief. Bursaw responded by filing a motion to dismiss and an opposition to the prayer for injunctive relief. As part of its response, Bursaw attached affidavits subscribed by Slifka and Edward Davis (Bursaw's operations manager).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a hearing on May 10 in respect to Karak's motion for a preliminary injunction. The court then took the matter under advisement, directing the parties to supplement the record. Pursuant to this directive, Karak swore out and served an affidavit, and Bursaw filed four affidavits of company officials (including supplementary declarations from Slifka and Davis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2001, the district court denied Karak's motion for injunctive relief and dismissed the action for want of federal subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Karak,</i> 147 F.Supp.2d at 15. The court's decision rested on two determinations: (1) that the idiosyncratic relationship between the parties did not fall within the scope of the PMPA, and (2) that it should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Karak's pendent state-law claims. <i>Id.</i> at 15-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karak abjured an appeal. Instead, he filed a strikingly similar suit in a Massachusetts state court. That court too denied Karak's pleas for injunctive relief. Karak then abandoned his state court action and returned to the federal court. This time, he filed what he termed a \"motion to reconsider\" (in reality, a motion for relief from judgment).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The motion invoked Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2)-(3) and incorporated affidavits from Karak's attorney, Richard P. Blaustein, and from a former Bursaw employee, Edward Yaeger. For eleven years, Yaeger had supervised the Karak-Bursaw relationship, and he had great familiarity both with that relationship and with Bursaw's corporate hierarchy. Yaeger claimed, inter alia, that Davis had misrepresented the structure of the company, and that both Davis and Slifka had distorted the nature of Bursaw's dealings with Karak. Karak asserted that this affidavit constituted new, previously undiscovered evidence supporting his position, and that it proved the falsity of Bursaw's representations to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bursaw strenuously opposed this motion. More importantly, the district court found it wanting and summarily denied it. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Analysis</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In our adversary system of justice, each litigant remains under an abiding duty to take the legal steps that are necessary to protect his or her own interests.\" <i>Cotto v. United States,</i> 993 F.2d 274, 278 (1st Cir.1993). Given this duty, the failure to take a timely appeal has serious consequences. While a motion for relief from judgment can be filed under certain circumstances, an appeal from the denial of such a motion will not expose the merits of the underlying judgment to appellate scrutiny. <i>See id.; Ojeda-Toro v. Rivera-Mendez,</i> 853 F.2d 25, 28-29 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also Rodriguez-Antuna v.</i> <i>Chase Manhattan Bank Corp.,</i> 871 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1989) (explaining that the appeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion \"does not automatically produce a Lazarus-like effect; it cannot resurrect appellants' expired right to contest the merits of the underlying judgment, nor bring the judgment itself before us for review\"). In short, an appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is not a surrogate for a seasonable appeal of the underlying judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of this paradigm, the merits of the district court's original order are not now in issue. To the contrary, the only justiciable question on this appeal involves the propriety of the lower court's denial of Karak's Rule 60(b) motion. Our inquiry into that question proceeds on the understanding that relief under Rule 60(b) is extraordinary in nature and that motions invoking that rule should be granted sparingly. <i>See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 19-20 (1st Cir.1992); <i>Lepore v. Vidockler,</i> 792 F.2d 272, 274 (1st Cir.1986). Thus, a party who seeks recourse under Rule 60(b) must persuade the trial court, at a bare minimum, that his motion is timely; that exceptional circumstances exist, favoring extraordinary relief; that if the judgment is set aside, he has the right stuff to mount a potentially meritorious claim or defense; and that no unfair prejudice will accrue to the opposing parties should the motion be granted. <i>Teamsters,</i> 953 F.2d at 20-21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion, the movant faces a further hurdle. The district court typically has an intimate, first-hand knowledge of the case, and, thus, is best positioned to determine whether the justification proffered in support of a Rule 60(b) motion should serve to override the opposing party's rights and the law's institutional interest in finality. Consequently, we defer broadly to the district court's informed discretion in granting or denying relief from judgment, and we review its ruling solely for abuse of that discretion. <i>Claremont Flock Corp. v. Alm,</i> 281 F.3d 297, 299 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Teamsters,</i> 953 F.2d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Rule 60(b)(2)</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn first to Karak's attempt to invoke Rule 60(b)(2). That rule provides in pertinent part that the trial court may relieve a party from a final judgment on the basis of \"newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered [within ten days of the date of the judgment.]\" On this record, we cannot disturb either the district court's assessment of these criteria or its decision to deny relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Karak touts the Yaeger affidavit as newly discovered evidence, he wholly fails to explain why this evidence could not have been found, well before the entry of judgment, in the exercise of even minimal diligence. The inference of availability seems compelling. Yaeger &#8212; although retired from his position at Bursaw &#8212; lived in nearby Lynn, Massachusetts. Karak had dealt with him for many years and knew him intimately. On the face of things, the delay in contacting Yaeger appears to doom Karak's current quest. <i>See, e.g., Washington v. Patlis,</i> 916 F.2d 1036, 1038 (5th Cir.1990) (affirming trial court's denial of Rule 60(b)(2) motion when movant knew of her \"newly discovered\" witness at the time she filed her complaint, but did not attempt to present that witness until after entry of judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, appearances can be deceiving. <i>Cf.</i> Aesop, The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing (circa 550 B.C.). But a party who seeks relief from a judgment based on newly discovered evidence must, at the very least, offer a convincing explanation as to why he could not have proffered the crucial evidence at an earlier stage of the proceedings. <i>See Lepore,</i> 792 F.2d at 274. Karak did not carry this burden: he himself eschewed any attempt to explain the delay in adducing Yaeger's version of the facts, and the Yaeger affidavit provided nothing suggesting that Yaeger was unavailable during the weeks leading up to the entry of judgment. Indeed, the only effort that Karak made to persuade the district court that Yaeger's evidence was beyond his reach was to file an affidavit from his then-counsel (Blaustein).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Blaustein affidavit is scarcely worth the paper on which it is typed. Other than parroting the language of Rule 60(b)(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Blaustein stated only that he did not know about Yaeger until June 23, 2001. That statement, even if true, is beside the point. The relevant standard is not whether a plaintiff told his attorney about a particular witness, but, rather, whether someone on the plaintiff's side of the case (be it the plaintiff or his attorney) knew of the witness. <i>See Parrilla-Lopez v. United States,</i> 841 F.2d 16, 19-20 (1st Cir.1988). Taking the record as a whole, Karak not only must have known of the witness (Yaeger) but also must have appreciated his likely significance. Thus, Karak has failed to undermine the logical inference that he had ample time and opportunity to secure and present the Yaeger affidavit prior to the initial entry of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karak endeavors to blunt the force of this reasoning by bemoaning that the case moved at lightning speed, thus depriving him of a fair chance to marshal his proof. This is little more than a post hoc rationalization. After all, it was Karak who dictated the pace of the proceedings by pressing vigorously for preliminary injunctive relief (which he termed \"emergency\" injunctive relief). Moreover, when the district court requested supplementary materials in connection with the motion to dismiss, Karak could have sought time for discovery or for further investigation. <i>Cf.</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). He elected not to do so. Having decided to proceed full throttle, Karak hardly can be heard to complain that the district court obliged him by moving expeditiously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, Karak failed to show that, had he exercised due diligence, Yaeger's affidavit would not have been available earlier. Given this failing, the district court did not abuse its wide discretion in denying the motion for relief from judgment insofar as that motion implicated Rule 60(b)(2). <i>See Lepore,</i> 792 F.2d at 274 (\"An unexcused failure to produce the relevant evidence before the entry of judgment is sufficient grounds for denial of a 60(b) motion.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Rule 60(b)(3)</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of Karak's argument suggests that his motion for relief from judgment should have been granted under the aegis of Rule 60(b)(3). That rule authorizes the district court to absolve a party from a final judgment upon a showing that the adverse party has committed \"fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct....\" There are two prerequisites to obtaining redress under this rule. First, the movant must demonstrate misconduct &#8212; such as fraud or misrepresentation &#8212; by clear and convincing evidence. <i>Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.,</i> 862 F.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir.1988). Second, the movant must \"show that the misconduct foreclosed full and fair preparation or presentation of [his] case.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karak's theory is that the Yaeger affidavit proves that Slifka's and Davis's affidavits contained material misstatements, and that those misstatements evince misconduct on Bursaw's part. This theory is far from watertight. For one thing, Karak overstates the degree to which the Yaeger affidavit contradicts the Slifka and Davis affidavits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For another thing, Karak himself knew most of the pertinent information contained in the Yaeger affidavit (e.g., information concerning the division of responsibilities between Karak and Bursaw during their working relationship). Finally, Yaeger's affidavit, even when read through rose-colored glasses, merely establishes a conflict in the evidence; it does not clearly and convincingly show that Slifka and Davis, at Bursaw's instance, intentionally misrepresented pertinent facts. The former showing, without the latter, is not enough. <i>See Geo. P. Reintjes Co. v. Riley Stoker Corp.,</i> 71 F.3d 44, 49 (1st Cir.1995) (holding that a showing of perjury, without more, is insufficient to entitle a party to relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(3)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we need not probe too deeply whether Karak made an adequate showing of misconduct. Even assuming that he did, any misstatements that may have occurred did not inhibit him from fully and fairly preparing his case. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To meet the second requirement for application of Rule 60(b)(3), the asserted misconduct \"must <i>substantially</i> have interfered with the aggrieved party's ability fully and fairly to prepare for and proceed [to judgment].\" <i>Anderson,</i> 862 F.2d at 924 (emphasis in original). The burden is on the movant to make this showing. But the Blaustein affidavit contains no claim that any such interference occurred, and Karak nowhere persuasively explains what interference transpired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of such an explanation is fatal, as the circumstances of the case, unexplained, do not support an inference of substantial interference. After all, Karak had at his beck and call the complete panoply of pretrial discovery devices, including deposition notices and demands for document production. He also had access to Yaeger, had he chosen to take advantage of that opportunity in a timely fashion. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). Karak availed himself of none of these measures. Had he done so, common sense suggests that he easily could have discovered any misstatements and laid bare the facts prior to the entry of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case like <i>Anderson,</i> in which a defendant allegedly concealed evidence during pretrial discovery. 862 F.2d at 922-23. Bursaw made no bones about the fact that Slifka and Davis were its key witnesses, and did not in any way obstruct Karak's ability to depose them or to inspect its corporate records. When a party is capable of fully and fairly preparing and presenting his case notwithstanding the adverse party's arguable misconduct, the trial court is free to deny relief under Rule 60(b)(3). <i>See Diaz v. Methodist Hosp.,</i> 46 F.3d 492, 497 (5th Cir.1995). So is it here: while one can debate the extent to which Yaeger's version of the facts differs from Slifka's and Davis's, and which of those versions is more credible, one cannot plausibly contend, on this record, that Karak's pursuit of the truth was hampered by anything except his own reluctance to undertake an assiduous investigation (including pretrial discovery).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter. Rule 60(b)(3) is designed to afford protection against judgments that are unfairly obtained rather than against judgments that are factually suspect. <i>In re M/V Peacock,</i> 809 F.2d 1403, 1405 (9th Cir.1987); <i>Rozier v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 573 F.2d 1332, 1339 (5th Cir.1978).

Later, he moved for relief from the judgment on grounds of newly discovered evidence, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2), and misrepresentation, Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). The district court denied the motion. Finding that ruling free from any abuse of discretion, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>I.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Background</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts that give rise to the underlying litigation are chronicled in the district court's original opinion, <i>see Karak,</i> 147 F.Supp.2d at 10-11, and it would be pleonastic to repeat them here. For present purposes, it suffices to say that, at the times relevant hereto, defendant-appellee Bursaw Oil Corp. (a wholesaler and distributor of motor fuel and allied products), through a subsidiary, owned a prime service station in Newton, Massachusetts. Beginning in 1989, plaintiff-appellant Elie N. Karak leased this station and sold, inter alia, gasoline supplied by Bursaw.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The parties' relationship was bounded by several agreements, revised and renewed periodically, which covered both the lease of the real estate and the supply of motor fuel. The last lease renewal expired on June 30, 2000. Karak nonetheless remained on the premises as a tenant at will, and Bursaw continued to supply the station with motor fuel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On or about February 20, 2001, Karak learned from Bursaw's general manager, Andrew Slifka, that Bursaw planned to sell the station to a third party. With that objective in mind, Bursaw served notice on March 28, 2001, directing Karak to vacate the premises within thirty days. Karak did not go quietly; as the thirty-day period wound down, he brought suit against Bursaw in the federal district court. His suit premised federal jurisdiction on the existence of a federal question, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, charging Bursaw with having violated the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act (PMPA), 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2801-2841.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Concerned about possession of the premises and his ability to keep his business afloat, Karak immediately moved for injunctive relief. The district court treated his motion as a motion for a temporary restraining order and denied it on April 30, 2001. Two days later, Karak filed an amended complaint and a renewed request for preliminary injunctive relief. Bursaw responded by filing a motion to dismiss and an opposition to the prayer for injunctive relief. As part of its response, Bursaw attached affidavits subscribed by Slifka and Edward Davis (Bursaw's operations manager).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a hearing on May 10 in respect to Karak's motion for a preliminary injunction. The court then took the matter under advisement, directing the parties to supplement the record. Pursuant to this directive, Karak swore out and served an affidavit, and Bursaw filed four affidavits of company officials (including supplementary declarations from Slifka and Davis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 30, 2001, the district court denied Karak's motion for injunctive relief and dismissed the action for want of federal subject matter jurisdiction. <i>Karak,</i> 147 F.Supp.2d at 15. The court's decision rested on two determinations: (1) that the idiosyncratic relationship between the parties did not fall within the scope of the PMPA, and (2) that it should not exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Karak's pendent state-law claims. <i>Id.</i> at 15-16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karak abjured an appeal. Instead, he filed a strikingly similar suit in a Massachusetts state court. That court too denied Karak's pleas for injunctive relief. Karak then abandoned his state court action and returned to the federal court. This time, he filed what he termed a \"motion to reconsider\" (in reality, a motion for relief from judgment).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The motion invoked Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(2)-(3) and incorporated affidavits from Karak's attorney, Richard P. Blaustein, and from a former Bursaw employee, Edward Yaeger. For eleven years, Yaeger had supervised the Karak-Bursaw relationship, and he had great familiarity both with that relationship and with Bursaw's corporate hierarchy. Yaeger claimed, inter alia, that Davis had misrepresented the structure of the company, and that both Davis and Slifka had distorted the nature of Bursaw's dealings with Karak. Karak asserted that this affidavit constituted new, previously undiscovered evidence supporting his position, and that it proved the falsity of Bursaw's representations to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bursaw strenuously opposed this motion. More importantly, the district court found it wanting and summarily denied it. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>II.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Analysis</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In our adversary system of justice, each litigant remains under an abiding duty to take the legal steps that are necessary to protect his or her own interests.\" <i>Cotto v.

Given this duty, the failure to take a timely appeal has serious consequences. While a motion for relief from judgment can be filed under certain circumstances, an appeal from the denial of such a motion will not expose the merits of the underlying judgment to appellate scrutiny. <i>See id.; Ojeda-Toro v. Rivera-Mendez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509523\"><a href=\"/opinion/509523/gladys-ojeda-toro-v-mario-e-rivera-mendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 28-29 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also Rodriguez-Antuna v.</i> <i>Chase Manhattan Bank Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520401\"><a href=\"/opinion/520401/migda-rodriguez-antuna-v-chase-manhattan-bank-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.1989) (explaining that the appeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion \"does not automatically produce a Lazarus-like effect; it cannot resurrect appellants' expired right to contest the merits of the underlying judgment, nor bring the judgment itself before us for review\"). In short, an appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is not a surrogate for a seasonable appeal of the underlying judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of this paradigm, the merits of the district court's original order are not now in issue. To the contrary, the only justiciable question on this appeal involves the propriety of the lower court's denial of Karak's Rule 60(b) motion. Our inquiry into that question proceeds on the understanding that relief under Rule 60(b) is extraordinary in nature and that motions invoking that rule should be granted sparingly. <i>See Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"575211\"><a href=\"/opinion/575211/teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-and-helpers-union-local-no-59-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1st Cir.1992); <i>Lepore v.

Thus, a party who seeks recourse under Rule 60(b) must persuade the trial court, at a bare minimum, that his motion is timely; that exceptional circumstances exist, favoring extraordinary relief; that if the judgment is set aside, he has the right stuff to mount a potentially meritorious claim or defense; and that no unfair prejudice will accrue to the opposing parties should the motion be granted. <i>Teamsters,</i> 953 F.2d at 20-21.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion, the movant faces a further hurdle. The district court typically has an intimate, first-hand knowledge of the case, and, thus, is best positioned to determine whether the justification proffered in support of a Rule 60(b) motion should serve to override the opposing party's rights and the law's institutional interest in finality. Consequently, we defer broadly to the district court's informed discretion in granting or denying relief from judgment, and we review its ruling solely for abuse of that discretion. <i>Claremont Flock Corp. v. Alm,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199843\"><a href=\"/opinion/199843/claremont-flock-v-alm/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span>, 299 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Teamsters,</i> 953 F.2d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>A.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Rule 60(b)(2)</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn first to Karak's attempt to invoke Rule 60(b)(2). That rule provides in pertinent part that the trial court may relieve a party from a final judgment on the basis of \"newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered [within ten days of the date of the judgment.]\" On this record, we cannot disturb either the district court's assessment of these criteria or its decision to deny relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Karak touts the Yaeger affidavit as newly discovered evidence, he wholly fails to explain why this evidence could not have been found, well before the entry of judgment, in the exercise of even minimal diligence. The inference of availability seems compelling. Yaeger &#8212; although retired from his position at Bursaw &#8212; lived in nearby Lynn, Massachusetts. Karak had dealt with him for many years and knew him intimately. On the face of things, the delay in contacting Yaeger appears to doom Karak's current quest. <i>See, e.g., Washington v. Patlis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550119\"><a href=\"/opinion/550119/colette-a-washington-v-dennis-patlis-colette-a-washington-v-herbert/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span>, 1038 (5th Cir.1990) (affirming trial court's denial of Rule 60(b)(2) motion when movant knew of her \"newly discovered\" witness at the time she filed her complaint, but did not attempt to present that witness until after entry of judgment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, appearances can be deceiving. <i>Cf.</i> Aesop, The Wolf in Sheep's Clothing (circa 550 B.C.). But a party who seeks relief from a judgment based on newly discovered evidence must, at the very least, offer a convincing explanation as to why he could not have proffered the crucial evidence at an earlier stage of the proceedings. <i>See Lepore,</i> 792 F.2d at 274. Karak did not carry this burden: he himself eschewed any attempt to explain the delay in adducing Yaeger's version of the facts, and the Yaeger affidavit provided nothing suggesting that Yaeger was unavailable during the weeks leading up to the entry of judgment. Indeed, the only effort that Karak made to persuade the district court that Yaeger's evidence was beyond his reach was to file an affidavit from his then-counsel (Blaustein).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Blaustein affidavit is scarcely worth the paper on which it is typed. Other than parroting the language of Rule 60(b)(2),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Blaustein stated only that he did not know about Yaeger until June 23, 2001. That statement, even if true, is beside the point. The relevant standard is not whether a plaintiff told his attorney about a particular witness, but, rather, whether someone on the plaintiff's side of the case (be it the plaintiff or his attorney) knew of the witness. <i>See Parrilla-Lopez v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502480\"><a href=\"/opinion/502480/juan-parrilla-lopez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1st Cir.1988). Taking the record as a whole, Karak not only must have known of the witness (Yaeger) but also must have appreciated his likely significance. Thus, Karak has failed to undermine the logical inference that he had ample time and opportunity to secure and present the Yaeger affidavit prior to the initial entry of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karak endeavors to blunt the force of this reasoning by bemoaning that the case moved at lightning speed, thus depriving him of a fair chance to marshal his proof. This is little more than a post hoc rationalization. After all, it was Karak who dictated the pace of the proceedings by pressing vigorously for preliminary injunctive relief (which he termed \"emergency\" injunctive relief). Moreover, when the district court requested supplementary materials in connection with the motion to dismiss, Karak could have sought time for discovery or for further investigation. <i>Cf.</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). He elected not to do so. Having decided to proceed full throttle, Karak hardly can be heard to complain that the district court obliged him by moving expeditiously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, Karak failed to show that, had he exercised due diligence, Yaeger's affidavit would not have been available earlier. Given this failing, the district court did not abuse its wide discretion in denying the motion for relief from judgment insofar as that motion implicated Rule 60(b)(2). <i>See Lepore,</i> 792 F.2d at 274 (\"An unexcused failure to produce the relevant evidence before the entry of judgment is sufficient grounds for denial of a 60(b) motion.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>B.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Rule 60(b)(3)</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second prong of Karak's argument suggests that his motion for relief from judgment should have been granted under the aegis of Rule 60(b)(3). That rule authorizes the district court to absolve a party from a final judgment upon a showing that the adverse party has committed \"fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct....\" There are two prerequisites to obtaining redress under this rule. First, the movant must demonstrate misconduct &#8212; such as fraud or misrepresentation &#8212; by clear and convincing evidence. <i>Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515444\"><a href=\"/opinion/515444/anne-anderson-v-cryovac-inc-anne-anderson-v-beatrice-foods-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">910</span></a></span>, 923 (1st Cir.1988). Second, the movant must \"show that the misconduct foreclosed full and fair preparation or presentation of [his] case.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Karak's theory is that the Yaeger affidavit proves that Slifka's and Davis's affidavits contained material misstatements, and that those misstatements evince misconduct on Bursaw's part. This theory is far from watertight. For one thing, Karak overstates the degree to which the Yaeger affidavit contradicts the Slifka and Davis affidavits.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For another thing, Karak himself knew most of the pertinent information contained in the Yaeger affidavit (e.g., information concerning the division of responsibilities between Karak and Bursaw during their working relationship). Finally, Yaeger's affidavit, even when read through rose-colored glasses, merely establishes a conflict in the evidence; it does not clearly and convincingly show that Slifka and Davis, at Bursaw's instance, intentionally misrepresented pertinent facts. The former showing, without the latter, is not enough. <i>See Geo. P. Reintjes Co. v. Riley Stoker Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196462\"><a href=\"/opinion/196462/reintjes-company-v-riley-stoker/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.1995) (holding that a showing of perjury, without more, is insufficient to entitle a party to relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(3)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, we need not probe too deeply whether Karak made an adequate showing of misconduct. Even assuming that he did, any misstatements that may have occurred did not inhibit him from fully and fairly preparing his case. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To meet the second requirement for application of Rule 60(b)(3), the asserted misconduct \"must <i>substantially</i> have interfered with the aggrieved party's ability fully and fairly to prepare for and proceed [to judgment].\" <i>Anderson,</i> 862 F.2d at 924 (emphasis in original). The burden is on the movant to make this showing. But the Blaustein affidavit contains no claim that any such interference occurred, and Karak nowhere persuasively explains what interference transpired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of such an explanation is fatal, as the circumstances of the case, unexplained, do not support an inference of substantial interference. After all, Karak had at his beck and call the complete panoply of pretrial discovery devices, including deposition notices and demands for document production. He also had access to Yaeger, had he chosen to take advantage of that opportunity in a timely fashion. <i>See supra</i> Part II(A). Karak availed himself of none of these measures. Had he done so, common sense suggests that he easily could have discovered any misstatements and laid bare the facts prior to the entry of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case like <i>Anderson,</i> in which a defendant allegedly concealed evidence during pretrial discovery. 862 F.2d at 922-23. Bursaw made no bones about the fact that Slifka and Davis were its key witnesses, and did not in any way obstruct Karak's ability to depose them or to inspect its corporate records. When a party is capable of fully and fairly preparing and presenting his case notwithstanding the adverse party's arguable misconduct, the trial court is free to deny relief under Rule 60(b)(3). <i>See Diaz v. Methodist Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6957\"><a href=\"/opinion/6957/diaz-v-methodist-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 497 (5th Cir.1995). So is it here: while one can debate the extent to which Yaeger's version of the facts differs from Slifka's and Davis's, and which of those versions is more credible, one cannot plausibly contend, on this record, that Karak's pursuit of the truth was hampered by anything except his own reluctance to undertake an assiduous investigation (including pretrial discovery).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends the matter. Rule 60(b)(3) is designed to afford protection against judgments that are unfairly obtained rather than against judgments that are factually suspect. <i>In re M/V Peacock,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482056\"><a href=\"/opinion/482056/in-re-mv-peacock-on-the-complaint-of-oskco-edwards-harry-m-tompkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1403</span></a></span>, 1405 (9th Cir.1987); <i>Rozier v.

In light of this design, the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to set aside the instant judgment under Rule 60(b)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>III.</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is trite, but true, that \"[c]ourts, like the Deity, are most frequently moved to help those who help themselves.\" <i>Paterson-Leitch Co. v.

As final judgment had entered in the district court on May 31, 2001, the appeal period was still open<i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Despite this window of opportunity, Karak again eschewed a direct appeal.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">At about this same time, Karak stipulated to the entry of judgment in yet a third case &#8212; an eviction proceeding that Bursaw had brought in a state district court. Under the terms of the stipulation, Karak agreed to vacate the service station premises no later than July 17, 2001.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We disregard the chanting of this mantra. Although a court, for purposes of a Rule 60(b) motion, sometimes may assume the truth of fact-specific statements proffered by the movant, it need not credit \"bald assertions, unsubstantiated conclusions, periphrastic circumlocutions, or hyperbolic rodomontade.\"<i>Teamsters,</i> 953 F.2d at 18.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> To cite but one glaring example, Karak contrasts Yaeger's testimony that Bursaw had two divisions dealing with gasoline sales to the public with Davis's testimony that Bursaw maintained three types of \"relationships\" with its affiliated service stations. Although Karak makes much of this \"misrepresentation,\" we see no necessary inconsistency in these descriptions</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
