SHAUGHNESSY,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n                 CITY OF LACONIA, ET AL.,\r\n\n                  Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n   [Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge. \r\n\n John J. Shaughnessy on brief pro se.\r\n\nMarch 12, 1999\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  John Shaughnessy appeals from the\r\ndistrict court's dismissal of his civil rights complaint\r\nseeking injunctive relief for failure to state a claim for\r\nrelief.  See 28 U.S.C.  1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) (requiring dismissal\r\nof in forma pauperis complaints which fail to state a claim for\r\nrelief).  The complaint asserted that the defendants had\r\nterminated Shaughnessy's rental assistance benefits under N.H.\r\nRev. Stat. Ann. 165:5 in violation of due process.   \r\n          We affirm because the complaint fails to state a\r\nclaim for relief, even assuming, for present purposes, that the\r\nmost stringent due process standards apply.  See Goldberg v.\r\nKelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970) (describing the due process\r\nprotections required before welfare benefits are terminated). \r\nThe benefits in question were finally terminated only after due\r\nnotice and hearings at which Shaughnessy, who appeared pro se,\r\nwas allowed to make a complete presentation of his arguments\r\nagainst termination.  In accordance with constitutional\r\nstandards, he received a written decision explaining why his\r\nbenefits were being terminated.  While the complaint asserted\r\nthat members of the Fair Hearing Board were biased, a\r\nprocedural defect, no structural flaw in established procedures\r\nwas described (the pertinent municipal guidelines required the\r\nappointment of impartial fair hearing officers who had not\r\nparticipated in the decision under review), and the complaint\r\ndid not allege that there were no adequate state procedures\r\navailable to remedy the procedural defect; hence, the complaint\r\nfailed to state a procedural due process claim.  See Cronin v.\r\nAmesbury, 81 F.3d 257, 260 &amp; n.2 (1st Cir. 1996) (rejecting a\r\npublic employee's claim that the hearing officer who terminated\r\nhis employment was biased because the state provided an\r\nadequate post-deprivation remedy).\r\n          Affirmed.     \n",
