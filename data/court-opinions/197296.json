Plaintiffs contend that  the University's three-tier\r\n\nfaculty  salary plan  has  a disparate  impact  upon the  pay\r\n\nreceived by women faculty.1  Each tier of the challenged plan\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Title VII  of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by\r\nthe Civil Rights Act of 1991, provides, in pertinent part:\r\n     (1)(A)    An  unlawful  employment   practice  based  on\r\ndisparate impact is established under this subchapter only if\r\n--\r\n          (i)  a   complaining  party  demonstrates   that  a\r\nrespondent uses a particular employment practice that  causes\r\na disparate impact  on the  basis of  race, color,  religion,\r\nsex,  or   national  origin  and  the   respondent  fails  to\r\ndemonstrate that  the challenged practice is  job related for\r\nthe  position   in  question  and  consistent  with  business\r\nnecessity; or\r\n          (ii) the complaining party makes  the demonstration\r\ndescribed in subparagraph (C)  with respect to an alternative\r\nemployment practice and the  respondent refuses to adopt such\r\nalternative employment practice.\r\n     42 U.S.C.   2000e-2(K)(1)(A) (West 1994).\r\n\n     The  Rhode  Island  Fair  Employment  Practices Act,  as\r\namended in 1991, states, in relevant part:\r\n     (a) An unlawful employment  practice prohibited by   28-\r\n5-7  may be  established by  proof of  disparate impact.   An\r\nunlawful employment practice by  proof of disparate impact is\r\nestablished when:\r\n          (1)  A complainant demonstrates  that an employment\r\npractice  results in a disparate impact on the basis of race,\r\ncolor, religion,  sex, sexual orientation, handicap,  age, or\r\ncountry  of ancestral  origin,  and the  respondent fails  to\r\ndemonstrate  that  the  practice   is  required  by  business\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nprovides  for  different salary  minimums  derived,  in large\r\n\npart, from data as to the average salaries paid nationally to\r\n\nprofessors  in  the  same  academic  disciplines  encompassed\r\n\nwithin  that tier.   Plaintiffs  base their  disparate impact\r\n\nclaim  on  the  fact  that  while  only  27  percent  of  the\r\n\nUniversity's  entire faculty  are  women, 31  percent of  the\r\n\nfaculty  clustered within  the  disciplines  included in  the\r\n\nlower  paying tiers are women,  while women make  up only ten\r\n\npercent of those in  the disciplines included in the  highest\r\n\npaid tier.\r\n\n          The   district  court   held  a  bench   trial  and\r\n\nthereafter issued  a comprehensive  Opinion and Order,  since\r\n\npublished.   Donnelly v.  R.I.  Bd. of  Governors for  Higher\r                                                                         \r\n\nEduc., 929 F.  Supp. 583 (D.R.I. 1996).  It  denied relief on\r                 \r\n\ntwo  independent grounds:    (1) that  the plaintiff  faculty\r\n\nmembers  had  failed to  establish  a  prima  facie  case  of\r\n\ndisparate impact; and (2)  that, even had such a  prima facie\r\n\ncase been  established,  the  University  had  sustained  the\r\n\nburden of showing  that the plan  it followed was  consistent\r\n\nwith  business necessity.   Id.   Because  we agree  with the\r                                           \r\n\ndistrict court that the plaintiffs  have failed to meet their\r\n\nburden that  the University's plan has a  disparate impact on\r\n\nfemale faculty members, we do not reach the issue of business\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nnecessity.\r\n     R.I.G.L.   28-5-7.2(a)(1) (West 1997).\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nnecessity.    We affirm  the  district  court's judgment  for\r\n\nsubstantially  the same reasons it set out in Sections I, II,\r\n\nand IV  of its Opinion and  Order.  As we  adopt the district\r\n\ncourt's reasoning (other than in Section III of its  opinion)\r\n\nwe  do not undertake a separate statement of our views except\r\n\nfor the following brief comments.\r\n\n          Plaintiffs,  as  the  district  court  shows,  have\r\n\nfailed to  establish all  the necessary ingredients  of their\r\n\nprima  facie  case of  disparate  impact,  in particular  the\r\n\n\"disparateness\" of the salary  plan's impact on the protected\r\n\ngroup  (women), and  the existence  of a  causal relationship\r\n\nbetween the  plan and  any purported  disparate impact.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nE.E.O.C. v.

Contrary to  the appellants'  contentions, the weight  of\r\nthe authority, both  before and  after the  enactment of  the\r\nCivil Rights Act of 1991, suggests that the element of impact\r\ncombines  two  components:    adverseness  and disparateness.\r\nCompare Mack A.

In fact,  the record strongly indicates\r\n\nthat  the faculty members, both  male and female,  in Tier B,\r\n\nthe  lowest  paid tier,  are better  off  than they  would be\r\n\nwithout  Plan A  and  better  off  than  are  their  academic\r\n\ncounterparts in the national market due to features of Plan A\r\n\nthat tend to improve  the compensation of professors teaching\r\n\nin  the lower paid disciplines.3  The appellants argue, to be\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nat 356 (\"Plaintiff carries the initial burden of proving that\r\na particular  device or  system adversely  affects employment\r                                                     \r\nopportunities of  a defined protected class  when compared to\r                                                                      \r\nthe effect that  device has upon  the opportunities of  other\r\nclasses.\"   (emphasis added)), and    5.54, at  419-21 (1988)\r\nwith Walter  B.  Connolly, Jr.  and  Michael J.  Connolly,  A\r                \r\nPractical Guide to Equal Employment Opportunity   1.02[1][a],\r\nat  1-18.1  (1996)   (\"Disparate  impact  . . . results  from\r\nfacially   neutral   employment   practices   that   have   a\r\ndisproportionately  negative  effect  on   certain  protected\r                                        \r\ngroups . . . .\"  (emphasis added)).\r\n\n     It  is  also  common sense  that,  to  avail oneself  of\r\nstatutes,  like Title  VII  and the  RI-FEPA,  which seek  to\r\nredress the effects of discriminatory employment practices on\r\nprotected  groups, one would have to show, at the very least,\r\nan  injury  stemming from  one  or  more of  those  practices\r\n(adverse impact)  disproportionately borne by members  of one\r\nor more of those groups (disparate impact).\r\n\n3.  Under  Plan A,  each academic  discipline starts  with an\r\nindex number,  from  the Oklahoma  State  University  Survey,\r\npegged to the average salary of assistant professors  in that\r\ndiscipline compared  to the average salary  for all assistant\r\nprofessors.  The disciplines  are then categorized into tiers\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nsure, that failure to recalculate the  index numbers has kept\r\n\na few  disciplines at  the University of  Rhode Island,  like\r\n\nnursing,  a predominately  female  discipline, in  tiers that\r\n\ncurrently  underestimate their  actual worth in  the national\r\n\nmarket.    But  there  is no  indication  that  other,  male-\r\n\ndominated disciplines  may not have suffered  a similar fate,\r\n\nand, in  any  event,  the fields  where  this  has  allegedly\r\n\noccurred  are not ones  within which appellants  teach at the\r\n\nUniversity of Rhode Island.\r\n\n          The appellants'  proof of the  causation aspect  of\r\n\ntheir  prima facie case is  also deficient.   As the district\r\n\ncourt  found,   Donnelly,  929   F.  Supp.  at   591-92,  the\r                                    \r\n\nprofessors' choice of academic field and the workings of  the\r\n\nnational  market, and  not  Plan A,  as  such, are  basically\r                                      \r\n\nresponsible for compensatory differences between tiers within\r\n\nthe  Plan, these differences  being generally  established by\r\n\nreference to  nationwide faculty salaries  within the various\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nand  their index  numbers are  rounded off to  the relational\r\nfactor assigned to their  particular tier.  Those disciplines\r\nrelegated to the  lowest tier further  benefit from Plan  A's\r\nexpress goal of narrowing  the salary disparities among tiers\r\nas careers  progress.   This  goal  of convergence  has  been\r\nachieved  by allocating a higher portion of the Plan A raises\r\nto the faculty members in Tier B.\r\n\n     Plan A actually accounts for only a small percentage  of\r\nthe salary  increases annually  awarded by the  University of\r\nRhode Island.  The  collective bargaining agreements  provide\r\nfor other salary increases,  like performance and merit based\r\nawards,   that  enable   exceptional   professors  in   every\r\ndiscipline to earn more than their peers.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\ndisciplines.  Most, if not all, higher education institutions\r\n\nin this country display similar discipline-based compensatory\r\n\ndisparities; without Plan A, faculty members in Tier B would,\r\n\non  the whole, continue to earn less (probably even less than\r\n\ncurrently) than those in the higher tiers.4\r\n\n          The  appellants take  the  disparate impact  theory\r\n\nbeyond its logical boundaries  when they suggest that faculty\r\n\nmembers in Tier B  should be compensated at the  same minimum\r\n\nrates as those in the different academic disciplines embraced\r\n\nby Tier  D.   In  so doing,  they seem  to  be introducing  a\r\n\ncomparable  worth  argument   into  Title  VII   and  RI-FEPA\r\n\nanalyses.    To  make  out  a  prima  facie  case  of  salary\r\n\ndiscrimination under  Title VII, and also  under the RI-FEPA,\r\n\nsee Newport Shipyard,  Inc. v. R.I.

They had sued in the district court for an injunction and damages pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq.  (1994) and the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, R.I.G.L. &#167; 28-5-1 et seq.  (1997).  Plaintiffs contend that the University's three-tier faculty salary plan has a disparate impact upon the pay received by women faculty.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Each tier of the challenged plan provides for different salary minimums derived, in large part, from data as to the average salaries paid nationally to professors in the same academic disciplines encompassed within that tier.  Plaintiffs base their disparate impact claim on the fact that while only 27 percent of the University's entire faculty are women, 31 percent of the faculty clustered within the disciplines included in the lower paying tiers are women, while women make up only ten percent of those in the disciplines included in the highest paid tier.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held a bench trial and thereafter issued a comprehensive Opinion and Order, since published.  Donnelly v. R.I. Bd. of Governors for Higher Educ., 929 F.Supp. 583 (D.R.I.1996).  It denied relief on two independent grounds:  (1) that the plaintiff faculty members had failed to establish a prima facie case of disparate impact;  and (2) that, even had such a prima facie case been established, the University had sustained the burden of showing that the plan it followed was consistent with business necessity.  Id. Because we agree with the district court that the plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden that the University's plan has a disparate impact on female faculty members, we do not reach the issue of business necessity.  We affirm the district court's judgment for substantially the same reasons it set out in Sections I, II, and IV of its Opinion and Order.  As we adopt the district court's reasoning (other than in Section III of its opinion) we do not undertake a separate statement of our views except for the following brief comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, as the district court shows, have failed to establish all the necessary ingredients of their prima facie case of disparate impact, in particular the \"disparateness\" of the salary plan's impact on the protected group (women), and the existence of a causal relationship between the plan and any purported disparate impact.  See E.E.O.C. v. Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, 48 F.3d 594, 601 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 65, 133 L.Ed.2d 27 (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus plaintiffs have not demonstrated that the challenged Plan A has any adverse impact either on women in general or themselves in particular (the latter being required in this non-class disparate impact action, Robinson v. Polaroid Corp., 732 F.2d 1010, 1016 (1st Cir.1984) (citing Coe v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., 646 F.2d 444, 451 (10th Cir.1981).))<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Nor have they shown that they, or the other female faculty members in Tier B (or Tier C) receive under the Plan salaries that are proportionately lower than those ordinarily paid to similarly situated males (i.e. males teaching in the same or comparable academic disciplines) at the University of Rhode Island or at other institutions around the country.  In fact, the record strongly indicates that the faculty members, both male and female, in Tier B, the lowest paid tier, are better off than they would be without Plan A and better off than are their academic counterparts in the national market due to features of Plan A that tend to improve the compensation of professors teaching in the lower paid disciplines.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The appellants argue, to be sure, that failure to recalculate the index numbers has kept a few disciplines at the University of Rhode Island, like nursing, a predominately female discipline, in tiers that currently underestimate their actual worth in the national market.  But there is no indication that other, maledominated disciplines may not have suffered a similar fate, and, in any event, the fields where this has allegedly occurred are not ones within which appellants teach at the University of Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' proof of the causation aspect of their prima facie case is also deficient.  As the district court found, Donnelly, 929 F.Supp. at 591-92, the professors' choice of academic field and the workings of the national market, and not Plan A, as such, are basically responsible for compensatory differences between tiers within the Plan, these differences being generally established by reference to nationwide faculty salaries within the various disciplines.  Most, if not all, higher education institutions in this country display similar discipline-based compensatory disparities;  without Plan A, faculty members in Tier B would, on the whole, continue to earn less (probably even less than currently) than those in the higher tiers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants take the disparate impact theory beyond its logical boundaries when they suggest that faculty members in Tier B should be compensated at the same minimum rates as those in the different academic disciplines embraced by Tier D. In so doing, they seem to be introducing a comparable worth argument into Title VII and RI-FEPA analyses.  To make out a prima facie case of salary discrimination under Title VII, and also under the RI-FEPA, see Newport Shipyard, Inc. v. R.I. Comm'n for Human Rights, et al., 484 A.2d 893, 898 (R.I.1984) (looking at the decisions of the federal courts construing Title VII for guidance in interpreting the RI-FEPA), a female claimant needs proof that similarly situated males were better paid.  Johnson v. University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, 70 F.3d 469, 478 (7th Cir.1995) (citing Weiss v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Chicago, 990 F.2d 333, 338 (7th Cir.1993)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The appellants in this case have failed to surmount this initial hurdle in the disparate impact analysis.

Compare Mack A. Player, Employment Discrimination Law &#167; 5.41, at 356 (\"Plaintiff carries the initial burden of proving that a particular device or system adversely affects employment opportunities of a defined protected class when compared to the effect that device has upon the opportunities of other classes.\"  (emphasis added)), and &#167; 5.54, at 419-21 (1988) with Walter B.

The disciplines are then categorized into tiers and their index numbers are rounded off to the relational factor assigned to their particular tier.  Those disciplines relegated to the lowest tier further benefit from Plan A's express goal of narrowing the salary disparities among tiers as careers progress.  This goal of convergence has been achieved by allocating a higher portion of the Plan A raises to the faculty members in Tier B</p>\n        <p>Plan A actually accounts for only a small percentage of the salary increases annually awarded by the University of Rhode Island.  The collective bargaining agreements provide for other salary increases, like performance and merit based awards, that enable exceptional professors in every discipline to earn more than their peers.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> One can imagine similar scenarios in other professions.

Compare Mack A. Player, Employment Discrimination Law &#167; 5.41, at 356 (\"Plaintiff carries the initial burden of proving that a particular device or system adversely affects employment opportunities of a defined protected class when compared to the effect that device has upon the opportunities of other classes.\"  (emphasis added)), and &#167; 5.54, at 419-21 (1988) with Walter B. Connolly, Jr. and Michael J. Connolly, A Practical Guide to Equal Employment Opportunity &#167; 1.02[a], at 1-18.1 (1996) (\"Disparate impact ... results from facially neutral employment practices that have a disproportionately negative effect on certain protected groups ....\"(emphasis added))</p>\n        <p>It is also common sense that, to avail oneself of statutes, like Title VII and the RI-FEPA, which seek to redress the effects of discriminatory employment practices on protected groups, one would have to show, at the very least, an injury stemming from one or more of those practices (adverse impact) disproportionately borne by members of one or more of those groups (disparate impact).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Under Plan A, each academic discipline starts with an index number, from the Oklahoma State University Survey, pegged to the average salary of assistant professors in that discipline compared to the average salary for all assistant professors.  The disciplines are then categorized into tiers and their index numbers are rounded off to the relational factor assigned to their particular tier.  Those disciplines relegated to the lowest tier further benefit from Plan A's express goal of narrowing the salary disparities among tiers as careers progress.  This goal of convergence has been achieved by allocating a higher portion of the Plan A raises to the faculty members in Tier B</p>\n        <p>Plan A actually accounts for only a small percentage of the salary increases annually awarded by the University of Rhode Island.  The collective bargaining agreements provide for other salary increases, like performance and merit based awards, that enable exceptional professors in every discipline to earn more than their peers.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> One can imagine similar scenarios in other professions.  For example, a hospital might set up a compensatory scheme in which, because of supply and demand dynamics, doctors in the obstetrics and gynecology department, a larger portion of whom might be female, get paid at a lower rate than those in the field of cardiology containing a higher proportion of males.
