Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Ahmet Diabate on brief pro se.\n     Robert D. McCallum, Jr., Assistant Attorney General, Terri J.\nScadron, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Lyle D. Jentzer, Attorney,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          April 3, 2002\n\f           Per Curiam. Ahmet Diabate, a native and citizen of\n\nGuinea, appeals the district court's dismissal of the petition\n\nhe filed for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.\n\nAn Immigration Judge found Diabate removable on account of his\n\nconviction of an aggravated felony, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), but granted his application for withholding\n\nof removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3).               Diabate's § 2241\n\npetition alleged that his due process rights were violated\n\nduring the INS's appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\") because he was never provided a copy of the transcripts\nof the proceedings before the Immigration Judge.          Diabate also\n\nchallenges the BIA's denial of withholding of removal, claiming\nthat he established his eligibility for that relief as a matter\nof law.\n\n           Although the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant\nResponsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) eliminated judicial review\nof final removal orders based on an alien's status as an\n\naggravated     felon,   federal    courts   \"retain    subject   matter\njurisdiction over [§ 2241] habeas petitions brought by aliens\nfacing removal to the extent those petitions are based on\n\ncolorable claims of legal error, that is, colorable claims that\nan   alien's   statutory   or     constitutional   rights   have   been\nviolated.\"     Carranza v. INS, 277 F.3d 65, 71 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nsee INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 314 n.38 (2001); Mahadeo v.\nReno, 226 F.3d 3, 8 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 121 S.Ct.\n\n2590 (2001).\n\n                                   -2-\n\f              Accordingly, Diabate's due process claim was within\n\n the scope of § 2241 review.          However, since Diabate's brief to\n\n the BIA did no more than vaguely allude to the fact that he had\n not received the transcripts, we doubt that the due process\n\n claim was sufficiently exhausted.             See Bernal-Vallejo v. INS,\n\n 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir. 1999); Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d\n\n 754, 761 (1st Cir. 1992).          Moreover, even if we assume that the\n\n claim was exhausted, we find no prejudicial error.1\n\n              Whether     the   district     court    had   jurisdiction     to\n\n consider the withholding of removal claim is less clear since\n deciding whether petitioner established his eligibility for\n\n that    relief    involves     a   review   of    both   factual   and   legal\n findings.    In any event, even assuming that the scope of habeas\n review extends to this kind of claim and that the district\n\n court should have considered it, we think petitioner has failed\n to establish that he was eligible for withholding of removal as\n a   matter   of   law.       The   evidence      petitioner   presented    was\n\n insufficient to compel a finding that his membership on, or\n defection from, Guinea's national soccer team constituted a\n political opinion or \"membership in a particular social group\"\n\n as the BIA has interpreted that phrase.                    See 8 U.S.C. §\n\n\n     1\n      To the extent Diabate contends that, under Accardi v.\nShaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954), no showing of prejudice was\nrequired because the failure to provide the transcripts violated an\nagency regulation or rule, we note that the argument is not\nproperly before us since petitioner did not raise it below. See\nAmcel Corp. v. Int'l Exec. Sales, Inc., 170 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir.\n1999); United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1992).\nIn any event, the argument is meritless.\n\n                                       -3-\n\f1231(b)(3); Matter of Acosta, 19 I & N. Dec. 211, 233-34 (BIA\n\n1985); accord Alvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -4-\n\f",
