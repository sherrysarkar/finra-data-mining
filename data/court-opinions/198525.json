BARNETT,\r\n\n                    Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n  COMMISSIONER, NH DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ETC., ET AL.,\r\n\n                    Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n              FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\n\n     [Hon. Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Stahl, Circuit Judge,\r\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Harry D. Barnett on brief pro se.\r\n\nJune 17, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Plaintiff-appellant Harry D. Barnett, a\r\nNew Hampshire state prisoner proceeding in forma pauperis and\r\npro se, appeals from the sua sponte dismissal of his complaint\r\nfor failure to state a claim.  See 28 U.S.C.  1915A(b)(1). \r\nFor the following reasons, we vacate, in part, but otherwise\r\naffirm.\r\n          In his complaint, Barnett asserts claims against\r\nvarious prison officials based on alleged cessation of a kosher\r\ndiet, improper handling of attorney mail (including an\r\nallegation that prison officials delayed delivery and read\r\nprivileged mail), and denial of meals.  Barnett subsequently\r\nsought leave to amend his complaint.  The proposed amended\r\ncomplaint sought to correct various omissions, to supplement\r\nthe improper-handling-of-mail claim with two new alleged\r\ninstances that had occurred since the filing of the complaint\r\n(this time, alleged improper handling of court mail, rather\r\nthan attorney mail), and to add a totally new claim under the\r\nAmericans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C.  12101, et seq.  \r\n          A magistrate judge (\"magistrate\") recommended that\r\nthe complaint be dismissed for failure to state a claim.  The\r\nmagistrate subsequently denied the motion to amend for failure\r\nto comply with Loc. R. 15.1(a) which requires litigants, in\r\nmotions to amend, to identify all that is new and explain why\r\nit was not included in the prior filing.  The district judge,\r\nafter review of Barnett's objections to the magistrate's\r\nreport, adopted the magistrate's recommendation of dismissal.\r\n          Barnett argues that the magistrate judge applied an\r\noverly stringent standard in evaluating his complaint, and\r\nthat, in any event, he should have been permitted to amend his\r\ncomplaint to cure any deficiencies.  The circuits are divided\r\nover whether the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\"PLRA\")\r\neliminates discretion to permit amendment to avoid dismissal. \r\nCompare McGore v. Wrigglesworth, 114 F.3d 601, 612 (6th Cir.\r\n1997) (\"Under the Prison Litigation Act, courts have no\r\ndiscretion in permitting a plaintiff to amend a complaint to\r\navoid a sua sponte dismissal.\") with Gomez v. USAA Fed. Sav.\r\nBank, 171 F.3d 794, 796 (2d Cir. 1999) (\"Although the language\r\nof  1915 is mandatory, stating that 'the court shall dismiss\r\nthe case' in the enumerated circumstances, we conclude that a\r\npro se plaintiff who is proceeding in forma pauperis should be\r\nafforded the same opportunity as a pro se fee-paid plaintiff to\r\namend his complaint prior to its dismissal for failure to state\r\na claim . . . \").   Given our disposition of the case, we need\r\nnot reach the question whether the denial of leave to amend was\r\nrequired by the PLRA or was otherwise justified as an exercise\r\nof authority under Loc. R. 15.1.\r\n          In particular, we conclude that the original\r\ncomplaint states a free exercise claim.  Cf. Ward v. Walsh, 1\r\nF.3d 873, 877 (9th Cir. 1992) (recognizing that inmates have the\r\nright to be provided with food that satisfies the dietary laws\r\nof their religion).  The magistrate recommended dismissal of\r\nthis claim because Barnett failed to identify the religion he\r\npractices or allege that consumption of a kosher diet is a\r\ntenet of his religion.  Contrary to the position taken by the\r\nmagistrate, we think that the missing allegation can be fairly\r\ninferred from facts Barnett does allege.  Barnett alleged that\r\nhe was required to, and did get, the approval of the chaplain\r\nto receive a kosher diet.  A natural inference is that the\r\nchaplain determined that Barnett has a religious need for a\r\nkosher diet.  \r\n          By contrast, we conclude that Barnett's improper-\r\nhandling-of-mail claim fails, and that it does so even if one\r\ntakes into account allegations in filings subsequent to the\r\ncomplaint.  Cf. Purvis v. Ponte, 929 F.2d 822 (1st Cir. 1991)\r\n(per curiam) (affirming dismissal where magistrate's report\r\nalerted plaintiff to complaint's deficiencies, and plaintiff's\r\nsubsequently-tendered filings were not curative).  Because the\r\nmail at issue was addressed to Barnett as president of a\r\ncorporation and the state defines \"contraband\" to include\r\ncorrespondence relating to the operation of a business, prison\r\nofficials could permissibly open the envelope and inspect its\r\ncontents, notwithstanding the fact that the letter was from an\r\nattorney.  See Taylor v. Sterrett, 532 F.2d 462, 475 (5th Cir.\r\n1976) (stating that privileged mail may be searched and seized\r\nif there is \"probable cause\").  \r\n          In addition, the delay in delivery was justified\r\ngiven the address on the envelope, Barnett's refusal to give\r\npermission to a search, and the resulting need to involve other\r\npersons in the decision how to handle the letter.  Cf. Lewis v.\r\nCasey, 518 U.S. 343, 361-62 (1996) (delays that are the product\r\nof prison regulations reasonably related to legitimate\r\npenological interests are not of constitutional significance,\r\neven where they result in actual injury); Owen v. Shuler, 466\r\nF. Supp. 5, 7 (N.D. Ind. 1977) (\"So long as a delay in mail\r\ndelivery is not unreasonable, it does not reach constitutional\r\ndimensions.\"), aff'd, 594 F.2d 867 (7th Cir. 1979).\r\n          We similarly conclude that Barnett's claim as to\r\nmissed meals fails even if one takes into account allegations\r\nin documents subsequent to the complaint.  Barnett alleged that\r\nhe was denied a meal on five occasions.  We agree with the\r\nmagistrate that these allegations do not rise to the level of\r\nan Eighth Amendment violation.  Barnett made no allegation that\r\nany of the meals he missed were in succession, and, as the\r\nmagistrate pointed out, occasionally missing a meal is entirely\r\nconsistent with the realities of modern life.  We add that\r\nBarnett has alleged no specific facts which would support an\r\ninference that he was being \"harassed\" for requesting kosher\r\nmeals.  Cf. Judge v. City of Lowell, 160 F.3d 67 (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n(refusing to accept purely conclusory pleading on the element\r\nof discriminatory intent).\r\n          As for Barnett's allegations of improper handling of\r\ncourt mail and his allegations under the ADA, these claims were\r\nraised for the first time in the proposed amended complaint. \r\nAccordingly, they have not been addressed by the district\r\ncourt.  In light of our decision to remand, we think it\r\nappropriate that Barnett be permitted to file a renewed motion\r\nto amend seeking leave to add these particular allegations.  We\r\nexpress no opinion as to whether these allegations state a\r\nclaim.\r\n          Affirmed, in part, and vacated, in part.\n",
