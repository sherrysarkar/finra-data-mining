Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Mauricio Hernandez-Arroyo for appellant.\n     Nelson Perez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Jorge E. Vega-\nPacheco, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                       October 11, 2001\n\f\f          STAHL,     Senior       Circuit     Judge.        Defendant-appellant\n\nAlbert Gonzalez-Arimont appeals his conviction and sentencing\n\nfor aiding and abetting in an armed carjacking resulting in\n\ndeath, 18 U.S.C. § 2119(3), and for use of a firearm during and\n\nin   relation   to   a    crime    of   violence,      18    U.S.C.    §   924(c).\n\nGonzalez-Arimont raises several issues.                  First, he appeals a\n\ndistrict court order denying a motion to dismiss his indictment\n\nfor failure of the government to bring him to trial within\n\nseventy days of indictment as required by the Speedy Trial Act,\n\n18 U.S.C. §§ 3161-3174.           Second, Gonzalez-Arimont argues that\n\nhis indictment and conviction for two separate counts involving\n\nthe same criminal conduct violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of\n\nthe Fifth Amendment. Although represented by counsel, appellant\n\nhas also filed a         pro se brief, arguing that his attorney's\n\nfailure   to    raise     the     Double      Jeopardy      issue     constitutes\n\nineffective assistance of counsel.               Finally, Gonzalez-Arimont\n\nappeals his sentence on the grounds that the district court\n\nerred in using his juvenile adjudications in determining his\n\ncriminal history and in reducing his criminal history category\n\nto II rather than I.        We affirm.\n\n                           I. Background\n\n          On    December        30,     1996,   Gonzalez-Arimont           and   an\n\nunindicted (now deceased) coconspirator approached Santo Santos\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fJordan and \"carjacked\" him at gunpoint.     Gonzalez-Arimont and\n\nthe coconspirator took Santos Jordan to an ATM machine where\n\nthey forced him to withdraw cash from his bank account.   Ten or\n\nfifteen minutes later they attempted to force Santos Jordan to\n\nwithdraw additional cash from a second ATM but were unable to do\n\nso.   Santos Jordan was shot and killed at some point that night.\n\nThe next day, after a brief chase, police apprehended Gonzalez-\n\nArimont and his coconspirator in Santos Jordan's car.\n\n          On June 11, 1997, Gonzalez-Arimont was arrested and\n\ncharged as a juvenile.   That case was assigned number 97-141 and\n\na U.S. Magistrate ordered the appellant detained without bail.\n\nOn October 16, 1998, almost a year and a half later, the\n\ndistrict court issued an order transferring Gonzalez-Arimont's\n\ncase to adult status under the same case number. Subsequently,\n\non November 23, 1998, a grand jury issued a two count indictment\n\ncharging him with aiding and abetting in an armed carjacking\n\nresulting in death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2119(3) (Count\n\nI) and with use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime\n\nof violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) (Count II). This\n\ncase was assigned a new number of 98-249.   Apparently due to the\n\nconfusion about the correct case number (which led the district\n\nclerk's office to designate the already incarcerated defendant\n\nas a fugitive in the adult case), Gonzalez-Arimont was not\n\n\n                               -4-\n\farraigned under the new indictment and hence did not enter a\n\nplea.\n\n          On February 1, 1999, the seventieth day after the\n\nreturn of the indictment, the United States filed a motion\n\nrequesting a status conference on criminal case number 97-141,\n\nthe juvenile case.    In turn, Gonzalez-Arimont filed a motion to\n\ndismiss the indictment in the adult case number 98-249 the next\n\nday, on grounds of the alleged Speedy Trial Act violation. The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion to dismiss the indictment on\n\ntwo alternative grounds.        First, the court found that, because\n\nGonzalez-Arimont     had   never    entered   a   not-guilty   plea   with\n\nrespect to the adult charges, the Speedy Trial Act clock had not\n\nbegun to run.   Second, the court held that, even if the Speedy\n\nTrial Act clock began running on the day the grand jury returned\n\nthe indictment on the adult charge, the government's request for\n\na status conference, albeit mistakenly filed under the juvenile\n\ncase number, was sufficient to stop the clock on the seventieth\n\nday after the indictment.          United States v. Gonzalez-Arimont,\n\nCrim. No. 98-249(SEC), R. Doc. 8 at 3-4 (D.P.R. March 8, 1999).\n\nHere,   appellant    requests      review   of    the   district   court's\n\ndetermination that there was no Speedy Trial Act violation.\n\n          After the motion to dismiss was denied, Gonzalez-\n\nArimont was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty to the\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fcharges.   Subsequently, on June 16, 1999, he pleaded guilty to\n\nboth counts of the indictment.      At the change of plea hearing,\n\nGonzalez-Arimont did not raise his Double Jeopardy objection\n\n(i.e., being indicted and convicted under two separate counts\n\ninvolving the same criminal conduct), but brings this issue\n\nbefore us on appeal. The record further indicates that Gonzalez-\n\nArimont did not seek to preserve his right to appeal the Speedy\n\nTrial Act issue.\n\n           The   presentence   report   recommended     that   Gonzalez-\n\nArimont's sentence for Count I be based on a criminal history\n\ncategory of IV, yielding a sentencing range of 360 months to\n\nlife   imprisonment.   In   arriving    at   this   determination,   the\n\nprobation department relied on information from the court for\n\nMinors Affairs in Caguas, Puerto Rico, showing three juvenile\n\nadjudications involving trespassing, a fight, and the possession\n\nof a single joint of marijuana.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing on March 23, 2000, the Court\n\nheard an objection by Gonzalez-Arimont that criminal history\n\ncategory IV over-represented his past history and that the\n\ndesignation should be adjusted downward to category I.          Although\n\nthe court agreed that there should be an adjustment, it reduced\n\nthe criminal history category to II rather than I and then\n\ndetermined that the appropriate imprisonment range for Count I\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fwas 324 to 405 months.          The court sentenced Gonzalez-Arimont to\n\na term of 405 months on Count I, with an additional 60 months\n\nfor count II, to be served consecutively.                     The inclusion of\n\nGonzalez-Arimont's          juvenile     adjudications        in    his     criminal\n\nhistory       and   the   determination        of   the   court    that    Gonzalez-\n\nArimont's criminal history should be downgraded to category II\n\nrather than category I, are the final issues Gonzalez-Arimont\n\nraises on appeal.\n\n                             II. Speedy Trial Act\n\n              Gonzalez-Arimont first asserts that the district court\n\nerred    in    denying    his   motion    to    dismiss     the    indictment    for\n\nfailure of the government to bring him to trial within the 70\n\ndays from indictment required by the Speedy Trial Act. 1                         We\n\nreview the legal findings underlying a district court's Speedy\n\nTrial Act ruling de novo and review factual findings for clear\n\nerror.    See United States v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1162 (1st\n\nCir. 1995). As a preliminary matter, however, the government\n\nargues    that       by   voluntarily     pleading        guilty     and    by   not\n\n\n\n    1 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1) provides in pertinent part: \"In any\ncase in which a plea of not guilty is entered, the trial of a\ndefendant charged in an information or indictment with the\ncommission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from\nthe filing date . . . of the information or indictment, or from\nthe date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of\nthe court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last\noccurs.\"\n\n                                         -7-\n\fsimultaneously reserving the right to appeal any speedy trial\n\nissue, Gonzalez-Arimont waived his right to appeal the district\n\ncourt's determination.      We agree.\n\n         This court has not previously ruled on the question of\n\nwhether a guilty plea precludes a defendant from appealing the\n\ndenial of his right to a speedy trial.               See United States v.\n\nGarcia-Martinez, 254 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2001) (finding it\n\nunnecessary   to   rule    on     the   waiver     question     because     the\n\nsubstantive Speedy Trial Act claim lacked merit); Acha v. United\n\nStates, 910 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1990) (same).                      But the\n\nprevailing    position    in    other     circuits    has     been   that    an\n\nunconditional guilty plea waives Speedy Trial Act claims on\n\nappeal. Taylor v. United States, 204 F.3d 828, 829 (8th Cir.\n\n2000) (holding that appellant's Speedy Trial Act claim was\n\nwaived by his plea of guilty); United States v. Bell, 966 F.2d\n\n914, 915 (5th Cir. 1992) (holding that a defendant who knowingly\n\nand   voluntarily        enters     a     guilty      plea     waives       all\n\nnonjurisdictional defects and that a Speedy Trial Act violation\n\nis such a nonjurisdictional defect); United States v. Bohn, 956\n\nF.2d 208, 209 (9th Cir. 1992) (same); United States v. Gines,\n\n964 F.2d 972, 976 (10th cir. 1992) (same);              United States v.\n\nPickett, 941 F.2d 411, 416-17 (6th Cir. 1991) (same); Lebowitz\n\nv. United States, 877 F.2d 207, 209 (2d Cir. 1989) (same);\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fUnited States v.     Yunis, 723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir. 1984)\n\n(same).\n\n          The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure specify \"that\n\nif a plea of guilty . . . is accepted by the court there will\n\nnot be a further trial of any kind, so that by pleading guilty\n\n. . . the defendant waives the right to a trial . . ..\" Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 11(c)(4).    In the course of the change of plea hearing,\n\nthe court asked Gonzalez-Arimont whether he understood that \"by\n\nentering a plea of guilty . . . there will be no trial and [he]\n\nwill have waived or given up [his] right to a trial as well as\n\nthose other rights associated with the trial . . .. \" (Tr. of\n\nChange of Plea, No. 98-249(SEC), R. Doc. 42 at 5 (D.P.R., June\n\n16, 1999).) Gonzalez-Arimont answered in the affirmative.       We\n\nhave previously held that, by waiving the right to a trial\n\nthrough   a    guilty     plea,     the   defendant   waives   all\n\nnonjurisdictional defenses.       See United States v. Cordero, 42\n\nF.3d 697, 699 (1st Cir. 1994); Acevedo-Ramos v. United States,\n\n961 F.2d 305, 308 (1st Cir. 1992); Valencia v. United States,\n\n923 F.2d 917, 920 (1st Cir. 1991). We now join with our sister\n\ncircuits and hold that a claim under the Speedy Trial Act is a\n\nnonjurisdictional defense that is waived with an unconditional\n\nguilty plea.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f            A defendant may, \"[w]ith the approval of the court and\n\nthe consent of the government, . . . enter a conditional plea of\n\nguilty . . ., reserving in writing the right, on appeal from the\n\njudgment,    to    review   of   the    adverse      determination   of   any\n\nspecified pretrial motion.\"            Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2).         See\n\nUnited States v. Caraballo-Cruz, 52 F.3d 390, 392 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (holding that the waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects\n\nunder   a   guilty   plea   is   overcome     when   the   parties   enter   a\n\nconditional       plea   agreement     that    expressly    preserves     the\n\ndefendant's right to raise an issue on appeal).               But Gonzalez-\n\nArimont made no attempt at the time of his guilty plea to\n\nreserve the Speedy Trial Act issue and we accordingly find that\n\nhe has waived his right to raise it on appeal.2                 See United\n\nStates v. Coffin, 76 F.3d 494, 497 (2d Cir. 1996) (finding that\n\nthe defendant could not bring a Speedy Trial Act issue on appeal\n\nwhere he had not reserved the right to appeal at the time of the\n\nguilty plea).\n\n\n\n    2 There may be cases in which denying the right to bring a\nSpeedy Trial Act claim on appeal, even in the absence of an\nexpress reservation, will lead to a significant miscarriage of\njustice.   While we are concerned that Gonzalez-Arimont spent\nalmost a year and a half in detention as a juvenile, without an\narraignment, only then to be indicted as an adult, we see no\nreal miscarriage of justice. In any case, the year and a half\nthat elapsed between Gonzalez-Arimont's arrest and indictment is\nnot an issue on appeal before us and we accordingly do not\naddress it.\n\n                                     -10-\n\f           Gonzalez-Arimont     additionally    contends      that   the\n\ndistrict court's substantive holdings on the Speedy Trial Act\n\nquestion   were   erroneous.     Because   we   find   that   Gonzalez-\n\nArimont's guilty plea precluded him from raising the speedy\n\ntrial issue on appeal, we need not address the substantive\n\nfindings of the district court.\n\n                  III. Double Jeopardy\n\n           Gonzalez-Arimont's     second    argument    is    that   his\n\nindictment and conviction for violations of both 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n2119(3) and 924(c) violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the\n\nFifth Amendment because the two counts concern the same criminal\n\nconduct.   In making this argument, appellant relies primarily on\n\na district court case which was reversed by this court, United\n\nStates v. Centeno-Torres, 857 F. Supp. 168 (D.P.R. 1994), rev'd,\n\n50 F.3d 84 (1st Cir. 1995).      Centeno-Torres involved the same\n\nstatutory provisions at issue in this case.       We found on appeal\n\nthat Congress intended § 924(c)'s firearm violation \"to serve as\n\na cumulative punishment in addition to that provided for the\n\nunderlying violent crime\" and that the Double Jeopardy Clause\n\nwas therefore not offended. 50 F.3d        at 85 (citing Missouri v.\n\nHunter, 459 U.S. 359, 367 (1983)). In a multi-panel circuit,\n\nuniformity of decision is achieved only by strict adherence to\n\nprevious holdings, with the function of overturning precedent\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\freserved for the court sitting en banc.      See Williams v. Ashland\n\nEng'g Co., Inc., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995);                 Lacy v.\n\nGardino, 791 F.2d 980, 985 (1st Cir. 1986).        We accordingly are\n\nbound   by   Centeno-Torres's   holding   that   there   is   no    Double\n\nJeopardy Clause violation in appellant's case; in any event, we\n\nsee nothing in appellant's argument to convince us that Centeno-\n\nTorres was wrongly decided.3\n\n             In a separate but related claim set forth in his pro\n\nse brief, appellant further argues that his counsel rendered\n\nineffective assistance by failing to raise the Double Jeopardy\n\nquestion discussed above. Notwithstanding our usual practice of\n\nrequiring ineffective assistance issues to be reserved for a\n\ncollateral attack, United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (citing cases), we can dispose of Gonzalez-Arimont's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim now.             The attorney's\n\nfailure to raise the Double Jeopardy question can hardly be\n\nconsidered ineffective assistance in light of the fact that the\n\nargument would have been contrary to clear precedent in this\n\nCircuit.     We have recognized an exception to the preference for\n\n\n\n    3Because appellant's Double Jeopardy claim is contradicted\nby clear precedent in this Circuit, and thus easily dismissed,\nwe do not reach the government's alternative argument that\nGonzalez-Arimont forfeited his right to have the claim\nconsidered on appeal by failing to first raise it in front of\nthe district court.\n\n                                 -12-\n\fresolving ineffective assistance arguments via collateral attack\n\nwhere \"the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the\n\nrecord is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration\n\nof an ineffective assistance claim.\"   United States v. Natanel,\n\n938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991). Gonzalez-Arimont's claim\n\nfalls squarely within that exception and we find that it is\n\nmeritless.\n\n                IV. Criminal History\n\n         Gonzalez-Arimont   has   appealed   his   sentence   on   two\n\ngrounds, both concerning the evaluation of his criminal history.\n\nFirst, he argues that the three misdemeanors on his juvenile\n\nrecord should not have been taken into consideration because\n\nthey were \"expunged convictions\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 4A1.2(j), and thus not to be counted in calculating his\n\ncriminal history.   Alternatively, the appellant contends that,\n\neven if the district court correctly included the misdemeanors\n\nin its criminal history determination, it should have reduced\n\nhis criminal history category to I rather than II.\n\n\n\n\n                              -13-\n\fA. Expungement Question\n\n           In    reviewing   a    sentence   under   the   United    States\n\nSentencing Guidelines (\"the Guidelines\"), \"[w]e first determine\n\nthe applicability of [each guideline] to a particular case de\n\nnovo. After determining the guideline's scope and meaning, we\n\nreview the district court's factual determinations for clear\n\nerror . . ..\" United States v. Cali, 87 F.3d 571, 575 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).                  At\n\nissue in Gonzalez-Arimont's appeal is the scope and meaning of\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(j); we therefore review the district court's\n\ndetermination de novo.\n\n           The    Guidelines      specifically   provide     for    certain\n\njuvenile   adjudications     to    be   considered   in    evaluating   the\n\ndefendant's criminal history.           U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d).4       But the\n\n\n\n    4U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(d) provides as follows:\n    (d) Offenses Committed Prior to Age Eighteen\n         (1) If the defendant was convicted as an adult and\n         received a sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year\n         and one month, add 3 points under §§4A1.1(a) for each\n         such sentence.\n         (2) In any other case,\n              (A) add 2 points under §4A1.1(b) for each adult\n              or juvenile sentence to confinement of at least\n              sixty days if the defendant was released from\n              such confinement within five years of his\n              commencement of the instant offense;\n              (B) add 1 point under §4A1.1(c) for each adult or\n              juvenile sentence imposed within five years of\n              the defendant's commencement of the instant\n              offense not covered in (A).\n\n                                    -14-\n\fguidelines also provide that \"sentences for expunged convictions\n\nare not counted . . ..\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(j). Gonzalez-Arimont\n\ncontends that juvenile adjudications, under Puerto Rico law, are\n\n\"expunged convictions\" within the meaning of § 4A1.2(j).                  We\n\nfind his argument unpersuasive.\n\n             The Commentary to § 4A1.2(j) provides as follows:\n\n             A number of jurisdictions have various procedures\n             pursuant to which previous convictions may be set\n             aside or the defendant may be pardoned for reasons\n             unrelated to innocence or errors of law, e.g., in\n             order to restore civil rights or to remove the stigma\n             associated with a criminal conviction. Sentences\n             resulting from such convictions are to be counted.\n             However, expunged convictions are not counted.\n             U.S.S.G. §4A1.2 cmt. n. 10.\n\nThe Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters (the\n\n\"Rules\") order juvenile records of minors to be sealed. 34 P.R.\n\nLAWS ANN. App. I-A R. 10.6 (1991).     The law contemplates extensive\n\nconfidentiality and severely restricts access to the records.\n\nId., App. I-A R. 10.2; see also, id., § 2237(d).             However, only\n\n\"where no probable cause has been determined, where no offense\n\nhas been perpetrated, or where complaints have been dismissed\"\n\nare the court records actually destroyed. Id., App. I-A R. 10.6.\n\n             The Rules thus suggest that juvenile records under\n\nPuerto Rico law are sealed and kept confidential for reasons\n\nthat   are   not   related   to   \"innocence   or   errors   of   law,\"   as\n\ncontemplated by the Commentary (since a concern with innocence\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\for error instead leads to destruction of the records).                     The\n\nRules specify that they are to be interpreted in part according\n\nto   the     purpose    of   \"provid[ing]    for     the   care,   protection,\n\ndevelopment, habilitation and rehabilitation of minors,\" Id., §\n\n2202(a), App. I-A R. 1.2, suggesting that the confidentiality of\n\nrecords       is     designed    to    remove      stigma    and    encourage\n\nrehabilitation.         We held in United States v. Fosher, 124 F.3d\n\n52, 57-58 (1st Cir. 1997), that a set-aside under the Federal\n\nYouth Corrections Act is \"for reasons unrelated to innocence or\n\nerrors of law\" and therefore not expungement.               We now similarly\n\nhold       that   Gonzalez-Arimont's    juvenile      adjudications,    while\n\nsealed and kept confidential under Puerto Rico law, most likely\n\nfor reasons of encouraging rehabilitation, were not \"expunged\"\n\nwithin the meaning of the Guidelines and were properly included\n\nin the calculation of his criminal history.5                 In taking this\n\nposition, we are in agreement with the majority of the circuits\n\nthat       have    considered   the   meaning   of    expungement     under   §\n\n4A1.2(j).         See, e.g., United States v. Hines, 133 F.3d 1360,\n\n1362-67 (10th Cir. 1998) (holding that \"Application Note 10\n\n\n\n       5\n     The confidentiality of juvenile records contemplated by\nPuerto Rico law is not threatened by our holding. The records\nwere provided to the sentencing court only, strictly for the\npurpose of a determination concerning defendant's criminal\nhistory.

Nicolace,\n\n90 F.3d 255, 258 (8th Cir. 1996) (finding that the set aside\n\nunder   the     Federal   Youth     Corrections       Act    was        enacted    to\n\n\"encourage a youth's evolution into productive citizenship\" and\n\nis   therefore    properly   included       in   calculating       the     criminal\n\nhistory score); United States v.

Criminal History Category\n\n           In    an   alternative    attack      on   the    criminal      history\n\ncalculation,     Gonzalez-Arimont         contends     that,       even     if    the\n\ndistrict      court    properly     took     account        of     his    juvenile\n\nadjudications, it should have assigned him a criminal history\n\ncategory of I rather than II.          He argues that, given the minor\n\nnature of the offenses and the young age at which they were\n\ncommitted, even a category of II over-represents his criminal\n\nhistory.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f         \"[A] district court's discretionary refusal to depart\n\ndownward is unreviewable unless the court believed it lacked the\n\nauthority to do so.\"   United States v.

In this case, the district court undisputably\n\nrecognized its authority to depart from a strict application of\n\nthe Guidelines, since it did so in reducing Gonzalez-Arimont's\n\ncriminal history category from IV to II.   We therefore decline\n\nto review the court's determination.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -18-\n\f",

Gonzalez-Arimont raises several issues. First, he appeals a district court order denying a motion to dismiss his indictment for failure of the government to bring him to trial within seventy days of indictment as required by the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161-3174. Second, Gonzalez-Arimont argues that his indictment and conviction for two separate counts involving the same criminal conduct violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Although represented by counsel, appellant has also filed a pro se brief, arguing that his attorney's failure to raise the Double Jeopardy issue constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Finally, Gonzalez-Arimont appeals his sentence on the grounds that the district court erred in using his juvenile adjudications in determining his criminal history and in reducing his criminal history category to II rather than I. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, 1996, Gonzalez-Arimont and an unindicted (now deceased) coconspirator approached Santo Santos Jordan and \"car jacked\" him at gunpoint. Gonzalez-Arimont and the coconspirator took Santos Jordan to an ATM machine where they forced him to withdraw cash from his bank account. Ten or fifteen minutes later they attempted to force Santos Jordan to withdraw additional cash from a second ATM but were unable to do so. Santos Jordan was shot and killed at some point that night. The next day, after a brief chase, police apprehended Gonzalez-Arimont and his coconspirator in Santos Jordan's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, 1997, Gonzalez-Arimont was arrested and charged as a juvenile. That case was assigned number 97-141 and a U.S. Magistrate ordered the appellant detained without bail. On October 16, 1998, almost a year and a half later, the district court issued an order transferring Gonzalez-Arimont's case to adult status under the same case number. Subsequently, on November 23, 1998, a grand jury issued a two count indictment charging him with aiding and abetting in an armed car jacking resulting in death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(3) (Count I) and with use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (Count II). This case was assigned a new number of 98-249. Apparently due to the confusion about the correct case number (which led the district clerk's office to designate the already incarcerated defendant as a fugitive in the adult case), Gonzalez-Arimont was not arraigned under the new indictment and hence did not enter a plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 1999, the seventieth day after the return of the indictment, the United States filed a motion requesting a status conference on criminal case number 97-141, the juvenile case. In turn, Gonzalez-Arimont filed a motion to dismiss the indictment in the adult case number 98-249 the next day, on grounds of the alleged Speedy Trial Act violation. The district court denied the motion to dismiss the indictment on two alternative grounds. First, the court found that, because Gonzalez-Arimont had never entered a not-guilty plea with respect to the adult charges, the Speedy Trial Act clock had not begun to run. Second, the court held that, even if the Speedy Trial Act clock began running on the day the grand jury returned the indictment on the adult charge, the government's request for a status conference, albeit mistakenly filed under the juvenile case number, was sufficient to stop the clock on the seventieth day after the indictment. United States v. Gonzalez-Arimont, Crim. No. 98-249(SEC), R. Doc. 8 at 3-4 (D.P.R. March 8, 1999). Here, appellant requests review of the district court's determination that there was no Speedy Trial Act violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the motion to dismiss was denied, Gonzalez-Arimont was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. Subsequently, on June 16, 1999, he pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment. At the change of plea hearing, Gonzalez-Arimont did not raise his Double Jeopardy objection (i.e., being indicted and convicted under two separate counts involving the same criminal conduct), but brings this issue before us on appeal. The record further indicates that Gonzalez-Arimont did not seek to preserve his right to appeal the Speedy Trial Act issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report recommended that Gonzalez-Arimont's sentence for Count I be based on a criminal history category of IV, yielding a sentencing range of 360 months to life imprisonment. In arriving at this determination, the probation department relied on information from the court for Minors Affairs in Caguas, Puerto Rico, showing three juvenile adjudications involving trespassing, a fight, and the possession of a single joint of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on March 23, 2000, the Court heard an objection by Gonzalez-Arimont that criminal history category IV over-represented his past history and that the designation should be adjusted downward to category I. Although the court agreed that there should be an adjustment, it reduced the criminal history category to II rather than I and then determined that the appropriate imprisonment range for Count I was 324 to 405 months. The court sentenced Gonzalez-Arimont to a term of 405 months on Count I, with an additional 60 months for count II, to be served consecutively. The inclusion of Gonzalez-Arimont's juvenile adjudications in his criminal history and the determination of the court that Gonzalez-Arimont's criminal history should be downgraded to category II rather than category I, are the final issues Gonzalez-Arimont raises on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Speedy Trial Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Arimont first asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment for failure of the government to bring him to trial within the 70 days from indictment required by the Speedy Trial Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We review the legal findings underlying a district court's Speedy Trial Act ruling de novo and review factual findings for clear error. See United States v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1162 (1st Cir. 1995). As a preliminary matter, however, the government argues that by voluntarily pleading guilty and by not simultaneously reserving the right to appeal any speedy trial issue, Gonzalez-Arimont waived his right to appeal the district court's determination. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not previously ruled on the question of whether a guilty plea precludes a defendant from appealing the denial of his right to a speedy trial. See United States v. Garcia-Martinez, 254 F.3d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 2001) (finding it unnecessary to rule on the waiver question because the substantive Speedy Trial Act claim lacked merit); Acha v. United States, 910 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1990) (same). But the prevailing position in other circuits has been that an unconditional guilty plea waives Speedy Trial Act claims on appeal. Taylor v. United States, 204 F.3d 828, 829 (8th Cir. 2000) (holding that appellant's Speedy Trial Act claim was waived by his plea of guilty); United States v. Bell, 966 F.2d 914, 915 (5th Cir. 1992) (holding that a defendant who knowingly and voluntarily enters a guilty plea waives all nonjurisdictional defects and that a Speedy Trial Act violation is such a nonjurisdictional defect); United States v. Bohn, 956 F.2d 208, 209 (9th Cir. 1992) (same); United States v. Gines, 964 F.2d 972, 976 (10th cir. 1992) (same); United States v. Pickett, 941 F.2d 411, 416-17 (6th Cir. 1991) (same); Lebowitz v. United States, 877 F.2d 207, 209 (2d Cir. 1989) (same); United States v. Yunis, 723 F.2d 795, 796 (11th Cir. 1984) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure specify \"that if a plea of guilty . . . is accepted by the court there will not be a further trial of any kind, so that by pleading guilty . . . the defendant waives the right to a trial . . ..\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(c)(4). In the course of the change of plea hearing, the court asked Gonzalez-Arimont whether he understood that \"by entering a plea of guilty . . . there will be no trial and [he] will have waived or given up [his] right to a trial as well as those other rights associated with the trial . . .. \" (Tr. of Change of Plea, No. 98-249(SEC), R. Doc. 42 at 5 (D.P.R., June 16, 1999).) Gonzalez-Arimont answered in the affirmative. We have previously held that, by waiving the right to a trial through a guilty plea, the defendant waives all nonjurisdictional defenses. See United States v. Cordero, 42 F.3d 697, 699 (1st Cir. 1994); Acevedo-Ramos v. United States, 961 F.2d 305, 308 (1st Cir. 1992); Valencia v. United States, 923 F.2d 917, 920 (1st Cir. 1991). We now join with our sister circuits and hold that a claim under the Speedy Trial Act is a nonjurisdictional defense that is waived with an unconditional guilty plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant may, \"[w]ith the approval of the court and the consent of the government, . . . enter a conditional plea of guilty . . ., reserving in writing the right, on appeal from the judgment, to review of the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion.\" Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)(2). See United States v. Caraballo-Cruz, 52 F.3d 390, 392 (1st Cir. 1995) (holding that the waiver of all nonjurisdictional defects under a guilty plea is overcome when the parties enter a conditional plea agreement that expressly preserves the defendant's right to raise an issue on appeal). But Gonzalez-Arimont made no attempt at the time of his guilty plea to reserve the Speedy Trial Act issue and we accordingly find that he has waived his right to raise it on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> See United States v. Coffin, 76 F.3d 494, 497 (2d Cir. 1996) (finding that the defendant could not bring a Speedy Trial Act issue on appeal where he had not reserved the right to appeal at the time of the guilty plea).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Arimont additionally contends that the district court's substantive holdings on the Speedy Trial Act question were erroneous. Because we find that Gonzalez-Arimont's guilty plea precluded him from raising the speedy trial issue on appeal, we need not address the substantive findings of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Arimont's second argument is that his indictment and conviction for violations of both 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2119(3) and 924(c) violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the two counts concern the same criminal conduct. In making this argument, appellant relies primarily on a district court case which was reversed by this court, United States v. Centeno-Torres, 857 F. Supp. 168 (D.P.R. 1994), rev'd, 50 F.3d 84 (1st Cir. 1995). Centeno-Torres involved the same statutory provisions at issue in this case. We found on appeal that Congress intended &#167; 924(c)'s firearm violation \"to serve as a cumulative punishment in addition to that provided for the underlying violent crime\" and that the Double Jeopardy Clause was therefore not offended. 50 F.3d at 85 (citing Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S. 359, 367 (1983)). In a multi-panel circuit, uniformity of decision is achieved only by strict adherence to previous holdings, with the function of overturning precedent reserved for the court sitting en banc. See Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., Inc., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995); Lacy v. Gardino, 791 F.2d 980, 985 (1st Cir. 1986). We accordingly are bound by Centeno-Torres's holding that there is no Double Jeopardy Clause violation in appellant's case; in any event, we see nothing in appellant's argument to convince us that Centeno-Torres was wrongly decided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separate but related claim set forth in his pro se brief, appellant further argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise the Double Jeopardy question discussed above. Notwithstanding our usual practice of requiring ineffective assistance issues to be reserved for a collateral attack, United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing cases), we can dispose of Gonzalez-Arimont's ineffective assistance of counsel claim now. The attorney's failure to raise the Double Jeopardy question can hardly be considered ineffective assistance in light of the fact that the argument would have been contrary to clear precedent in this Circuit. We have recognized an exception to the preference for resolving ineffective assistance arguments via collateral attack where \"the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of an ineffective assistance claim.\" United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991). Gonzalez-Arimont's claim falls squarely within that exception and we find that it is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Criminal History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Arimont has appealed his sentence on two grounds, both concerning the evaluation of his criminal history. First, he argues that the three misdemeanors on his juvenile record should not have been taken into consideration because they were \"expunged convictions\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(j), and thus not to be counted in calculating his criminal history. Alternatively, the appellant contends that, even if the district court correctly included the misdemeanors in its criminal history determination, it should have reduced his criminal history category to I rather than II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Expungement Question</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"the Guidelines\"), \"[w]e first determine the applicability of [each guideline] to a particular case de novo. After determining the guideline's scope and meaning, we review the district court's factual determinations for clear error . . ..\" United States v. Cali, 87 F.3d 571, 575 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). At issue in Gonzalez-Arimont's appeal is the scope and meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(j); we therefore review the district court's determination de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines specifically provide for certain juvenile adjudications to be considered in evaluating the defendant's criminal history.

Gonzalez-Arimont contends that juvenile adjudications, under Puerto Rico law, are \"expunged convictions\" within the meaning of &#167; 4A1.2(j). We find his argument unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commentary to &#167; 4A1.2(j) provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of jurisdictions have various procedures pursuant to which previous convictions may be set aside or the defendant may be pardoned for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law, e.g., in order to restore civil rights or to remove the stigma associated with a criminal conviction. Sentences resulting from such convictions are to be counted. However, expunged convictions are not counted. U.S.S.G. &#167;4A1.2 cmt. n. 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters (the \"Rules\") order juvenile records of minors to be sealed. 34 P.R. Laws Ann. App. I-A R. 10.6 (1991). The law contemplates extensive confidentiality and severely restricts access to the records. Id., App. I-A R. 10.2; see also, id., &#167; 2237(d). However, only \"where no probable cause has been determined, where no offense has been perpetrated, or where complaints have been dismissed\" are the court records actually destroyed. Id., App. I-A R. 10.6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rules thus suggest that juvenile records under Puerto Rico law are sealed and kept confidential for reasons that are not related to \"innocence or errors of law,\" as contemplated by the Commentary (since a concern with innocence or error instead leads to destruction of the records). The Rules specify that they are to be interpreted in part according to the purpose of \"provid[ing] for the care, protection, development, habilitation and rehabilitation of minors,\" Id., &#167; 2202(a), App. I-A R. 1.2, suggesting that the confidentiality of records is designed to remove stigma and encourage rehabilitation. We held in United States v. Fosher, 124 F.3d 52, 57-58 (1st Cir. 1997), that a set-aside under the Federal Youth Corrections Act is \"for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law\" and therefore not expungement. We now similarly hold that Gonzalez-Arimont's juvenile adjudications, while sealed and kept confidential under Puerto Rico law, most likely for reasons of encouraging rehabilitation, were not \"expunged\" within the meaning of the Guidelines and were properly included in the calculation of his criminal history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In taking this position, we are in agreement with the majority of the circuits that have considered the meaning of expungement under &#167; 4A1.2(j). See, e.g., United States v. Hines, 133 F.3d 1360, 1362-67 (10th Cir. 1998) (holding that \"Application Note 10 requires sentencing courts to analyze the true basis for expungement under state law rather than relying on the varied nomenclature among jurisdictions\"); United States v. Nicolace, 90 F.3d 255, 258 (8th Cir. 1996) (finding that the set aside under the Federal Youth Corrections Act was enacted to \"encourage a youth's evolution into productive citizenship\" and is therefore properly included in calculating the criminal history score); United States v. McDonald, 991 F.2d 866, 871-72 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding that a set aside under the District of Columbia Youth Rehabilitation Act is for the social objective of rehabilitating juvenile offenders and therefore not expungement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Criminal History Category</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an alternative attack on the criminal history calculation, Gonzalez-Arimont contends that, even if the district court properly took account of his juvenile adjudications, it should have assigned him a criminal history category of I rather than II. He argues that, given the minor nature of the offenses and the young age at which they were committed, even a category of II over-represents his criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A] district court's discretionary refusal to depart downward is unreviewable unless the court believed it lacked the authority to do so.\" United States v.

In this case, the district court undisputably recognized its authority to depart from a strict application of the Guidelines, since it did so in reducing Gonzalez-Arimont's criminal history category from IV to II.

Gonzalez-Arimont raises several issues. First, he appeals a district court order denying a motion to dismiss his indictment for failure of the government to bring him to trial within seventy days of indictment as required by the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161-3174. Second, Gonzalez-Arimont argues that his indictment and conviction for two separate counts involving the same criminal conduct violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Although represented by counsel, appellant has also filed a pro se brief, arguing that his attorney's failure to raise the Double Jeopardy issue constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. Finally, Gonzalez-Arimont appeals his sentence on the grounds that the district court erred in using his juvenile adjudications in determining his criminal history and in reducing his criminal history category to II rather than I. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 30, 1996, Gonzalez-Arimont and an unindicted (now deceased) coconspirator approached Santo Santos Jordan and \"car jacked\" him at gunpoint. Gonzalez-Arimont and the coconspirator took Santos Jordan to an ATM machine where they forced him to withdraw cash from his bank account. Ten or fifteen minutes later they attempted to force Santos Jordan to withdraw additional cash from a second ATM but were unable to do so. Santos Jordan was shot and killed at some point that night. The next day, after a brief chase, police apprehended Gonzalez-Arimont and his coconspirator in Santos Jordan's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 11, 1997, Gonzalez-Arimont was arrested and charged as a juvenile. That case was assigned number 97-141 and a U.S. Magistrate ordered the appellant detained without bail. On October 16, 1998, almost a year and a half later, the district court issued an order transferring Gonzalez-Arimont's case to adult status under the same case number. Subsequently, on November 23, 1998, a grand jury issued a two count indictment charging him with aiding and abetting in an armed car jacking resulting in death, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2119(3) (Count I) and with use of a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c) (Count II). This case was assigned a new number of 98-249. Apparently due to the confusion about the correct case number (which led the district clerk's office to designate the already incarcerated defendant as a fugitive in the adult case), Gonzalez-Arimont was not arraigned under the new indictment and hence did not enter a plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 1, 1999, the seventieth day after the return of the indictment, the United States filed a motion requesting a status conference on criminal case number 97-141, the juvenile case. In turn, Gonzalez-Arimont filed a motion to dismiss the indictment in the adult case number 98-249 the next day, on grounds of the alleged Speedy Trial Act violation. The district court denied the motion to dismiss the indictment on two alternative grounds. First, the court found that, because Gonzalez-Arimont had never entered a not-guilty plea with respect to the adult charges, the Speedy Trial Act clock had not begun to run. Second, the court held that, even if the Speedy Trial Act clock began running on the day the grand jury returned the indictment on the adult charge, the government's request for a status conference, albeit mistakenly filed under the juvenile case number, was sufficient to stop the clock on the seventieth day after the indictment. United States v. Gonzalez-Arimont, Crim. No. 98-249(SEC), R. Doc. 8 at 3-4 (D.P.R. March 8, 1999). Here, appellant requests review of the district court's determination that there was no Speedy Trial Act violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the motion to dismiss was denied, Gonzalez-Arimont was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty to the charges. Subsequently, on June 16, 1999, he pleaded guilty to both counts of the indictment. At the change of plea hearing, Gonzalez-Arimont did not raise his Double Jeopardy objection (i.e., being indicted and convicted under two separate counts involving the same criminal conduct), but brings this issue before us on appeal. The record further indicates that Gonzalez-Arimont did not seek to preserve his right to appeal the Speedy Trial Act issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report recommended that Gonzalez-Arimont's sentence for Count I be based on a criminal history category of IV, yielding a sentencing range of 360 months to life imprisonment. In arriving at this determination, the probation department relied on information from the court for Minors Affairs in Caguas, Puerto Rico, showing three juvenile adjudications involving trespassing, a fight, and the possession of a single joint of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing on March 23, 2000, the Court heard an objection by Gonzalez-Arimont that criminal history category IV over-represented his past history and that the designation should be adjusted downward to category I. Although the court agreed that there should be an adjustment, it reduced the criminal history category to II rather than I and then determined that the appropriate imprisonment range for Count I was 324 to 405 months. The court sentenced Gonzalez-Arimont to a term of 405 months on Count I, with an additional 60 months for count II, to be served consecutively. The inclusion of Gonzalez-Arimont's juvenile adjudications in his criminal history and the determination of the court that Gonzalez-Arimont's criminal history should be downgraded to category II rather than category I, are the final issues Gonzalez-Arimont raises on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Speedy Trial Act</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Arimont first asserts that the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment for failure of the government to bring him to trial within the 70 days from indictment required by the Speedy Trial Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> We review the legal findings underlying a district court's Speedy Trial Act ruling de novo and review factual findings for clear error.

As a preliminary matter, however, the government argues that by voluntarily pleading guilty and by not simultaneously reserving the right to appeal any speedy trial issue, Gonzalez-Arimont waived his right to appeal the district court's determination. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has not previously ruled on the question of whether a guilty plea precludes a defendant from appealing the denial of his right to a speedy trial.

But Gonzalez-Arimont made no attempt at the time of his guilty plea to reserve the Speedy Trial Act issue and we accordingly find that he has waived his right to raise it on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> See United States v.

Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Arimont's second argument is that his indictment and conviction for violations of both 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2119(3) and 924(c) violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because the two counts concern the same criminal conduct. In making this argument, appellant relies primarily on a district court case which was reversed by this court, United States v.

Centeno-Torres involved the same statutory provisions at issue in this case.

In a multi-panel circuit, uniformity of decision is achieved only by strict adherence to previous holdings, with the function of overturning precedent reserved for the court sitting en banc. See Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195880\"><a href=\"/opinion/195880/williams-v-ashland-engineering/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span>, 592 (1st Cir. 1995); Lacy v. Gardino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"470962\"><a href=\"/opinion/470962/leonard-lacy-v-joseph-gardino-superintendent-northeastern-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">791</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 985 (1st Cir. 1986). We accordingly are bound by Centeno-Torres's holding that there is no Double Jeopardy Clause violation in appellant's case; in any event, we see nothing in appellant's argument to convince us that Centeno-Torres was wrongly decided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separate but related claim set forth in his pro se brief, appellant further argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to raise the Double Jeopardy question discussed above. Notwithstanding our usual practice of requiring ineffective assistance issues to be reserved for a collateral attack, United States v. Mala, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing cases), we can dispose of Gonzalez-Arimont's ineffective assistance of counsel claim now. The attorney's failure to raise the Double Jeopardy question can hardly be considered ineffective assistance in light of the fact that the argument would have been contrary to clear precedent in this Circuit. We have recognized an exception to the preference for resolving ineffective assistance arguments via collateral attack where \"the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the record is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of an ineffective assistance claim.\" United States v. Natanel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 309 (1st Cir. 1991). Gonzalez-Arimont's claim falls squarely within that exception and we find that it is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. Criminal History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gonzalez-Arimont has appealed his sentence on two grounds, both concerning the evaluation of his criminal history. First, he argues that the three misdemeanors on his juvenile record should not have been taken into consideration because they were \"expunged convictions\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(j), and thus not to be counted in calculating his criminal history. Alternatively, the appellant contends that, even if the district court correctly included the misdemeanors in its criminal history determination, it should have reduced his criminal history category to I rather than II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Expungement Question</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a sentence under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\"the Guidelines\"), \"[w]e first determine the applicability of [each guideline] to a particular case de novo. After determining the guideline's scope and meaning, we review the district court's factual determinations for clear error . . ..\" United States v. Cali, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196836\"><a href=\"/opinion/196836/united-states-v-cali/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span>, 575 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). At issue in Gonzalez-Arimont's appeal is the scope and meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(j); we therefore review the district court's determination de novo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines specifically provide for certain juvenile adjudications to be considered in evaluating the defendant's criminal history. U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(d).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> But the guidelines also provide that \"sentences for expunged convictions are not counted . . ..\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(j). Gonzalez-Arimont contends that juvenile adjudications, under Puerto Rico law, are \"expunged convictions\" within the meaning of &#167; 4A1.2(j). We find his argument unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commentary to &#167; 4A1.2(j) provides as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A number of jurisdictions have various procedures pursuant to which previous convictions may be set aside or the defendant may be pardoned for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law, e.g., in order to restore civil rights or to remove the stigma associated with a criminal conviction. Sentences resulting from such convictions are to be counted. However, expunged convictions are not counted. U.S.S.G. &#167;4A1.2 cmt. n. 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Puerto Rico Rules of Procedure for Minors' Matters (the \"Rules\") order juvenile records of minors to be sealed. 34 P.R. Laws Ann. App. I-A R. 10.6 (1991). The law contemplates extensive confidentiality and severely restricts access to the records. Id., App. I-A R. 10.2; see also, id., &#167; 2237(d). However, only \"where no probable cause has been determined, where no offense has been perpetrated, or where complaints have been dismissed\" are the court records actually destroyed. Id., App. I-A R. 10.6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rules thus suggest that juvenile records under Puerto Rico law are sealed and kept confidential for reasons that are not related to \"innocence or errors of law,\" as contemplated by the Commentary (since a concern with innocence or error instead leads to destruction of the records). The Rules specify that they are to be interpreted in part according to the purpose of \"provid[ing] for the care, protection, development, habilitation and rehabilitation of minors,\" Id., &#167; 2202(a), App. I-A R. 1.2, suggesting that the confidentiality of records is designed to remove stigma and encourage rehabilitation. We held in United States v. Fosher, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745473\"><a href=\"/opinion/745473/united-states-v-michael-p-fosher/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 57-58 (1st Cir. 1997), that a set-aside under the Federal Youth Corrections Act is \"for reasons unrelated to innocence or errors of law\" and therefore not expungement. We now similarly hold that Gonzalez-Arimont's juvenile adjudications, while sealed and kept confidential under Puerto Rico law, most likely for reasons of encouraging rehabilitation, were not \"expunged\" within the meaning of the Guidelines and were properly included in the calculation of his criminal history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> In taking this position, we are in agreement with the majority of the circuits that have considered the meaning of expungement under &#167; 4A1.2(j). See, e.g., United States v. Hines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"155854\"><a href=\"/opinion/155854/united-states-v-hines/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1360</span></a></span>, 1362-67 (10th Cir. 1998) (holding that \"Application Note 10 requires sentencing courts to analyze the true basis for expungement under state law rather than relying on the varied nomenclature among jurisdictions\"); United States v. Nicolace, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722455\"><a href=\"/opinion/722455/united-states-v-karl-edward-nicolace/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 258 (8th Cir. 1996) (finding that the set aside under the Federal Youth Corrections Act was enacted to \"encourage a youth's evolution into productive citizenship\" and is therefore properly included in calculating the criminal history score); United States v. McDonald, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605522\"><a href=\"/opinion/605522/united-states-v-anthony-maurice-mcdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span>, 871-72 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (holding that a set aside under the District of Columbia Youth Rehabilitation Act is for the social objective of rehabilitating juvenile offenders and therefore not expungement).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Criminal History Category</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an alternative attack on the criminal history calculation, Gonzalez-Arimont contends that, even if the district court properly took account of his juvenile adjudications, it should have assigned him a criminal history category of I rather than II. He argues that, given the minor nature of the offenses and the young age at which they were committed, even a category of II over-represents his criminal history.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[A] district court's discretionary refusal to depart downward is unreviewable unless the court believed it lacked the authority to do so.\" United States v. Patrick, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199398\"><a href=\"/opinion/199398/united-states-v-patrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir. 2001), petition for cert. filed (U.S. Aug. 1, 2001) (No. 01-5868). In this case, the district court undisputably recognized its authority to depart from a strict application of the Guidelines, since it did so in reducing Gonzalez-Arimont's criminal history category from IV to II. We therefore decline to review the court's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(c)(1) provides in pertinent part: \"In any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered, the trial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment with the commission of an offense shall commence within seventy days from the filing date . . . of the information or indictment, or from the date the defendant has appeared before a judicial officer of the court in which such charge is pending, whichever date last occurs.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> There may be cases in which denying the right to bring a Speedy Trial Act claim on appeal, even in the absence of an express reservation, will lead to a significant miscarriage of justice. While we are concerned that Gonzalez-Arimont spent almost a year and a half in detention as a juvenile, without an arraignment, only then to be indicted as an adult, we see no real miscarriage of justice. In any case, the year and a half that elapsed between Gonzalez-Arimont's arrest and indictment is not an issue on appeal before us and we accordingly do not address it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because appellant's Double Jeopardy claim is contradicted by clear precedent in this Circuit, and thus easily dismissed, we do not reach the government's alternative argument that Gonzalez-Arimont forfeited his right to have the claim considered on appeal by failing to first raise it in front of the district court.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(d) provides as follows:</p>\n        <p>(d) Offenses Committed Prior to Age Eighteen</p>\n        <p>(1) If the defendant was convicted as an adult and received a sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month, add 3 points under &#167;&#167;4A1.1(a) for each such sentence.</p>\n        <p>(2) In any other case,</p>\n        <p>(A) add 2 points under &#167;4A1.1(b) for each adult or juvenile sentence to confinement of at least sixty days if the defendant was released from such confinement within five years of his commencement of the instant offense;</p>\n        <p>(B) add 1 point under &#167;4A1.1(c) for each adult or juvenile sentence imposed within five years of the defendant's commencement of the instant offense not covered in (A).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The confidentiality of juvenile records contemplated by Puerto Rico law is not threatened by our holding.
