During\r\n\nthat time,  Chapman communicated  via computer  and telephone\r\n\nwith  an AOL  subscriber in  Michigan (a  cooperating witness\r\n\nreferred  to  by the  government  as  \"Dan\") about  Chapman's\r\n\nsexual interest in children.   Chapman told Dan about  having\r\n\nhad sexual relations with  children as young as seven  years,\r\n\nand discussed with Dan  the possibility of abducting  a young\r\n\ngirl,  bringing her to Michigan where both men would have sex\r\n\nwith her, and then  killing her.  Chapman also  told Dan that\r\n\nhe  possessed a \"snuff film\" depicting the rape and murder of\r\n\na ten-year-old girl, as well as other child pornography.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  All  references  to  the  Sentencing  Guidelines,  unless\r\notherwise noted, are to the 1993 Guidelines Manual.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          On  December  2,  1993,  Chapman   sent  Dan  three\r\n\nphotographs via  the computer network, each  with a different\r\n\nfile  designation.   Two  of the  pictures  depicted nude  or\r\n\npartially nude  girls, while the third depicted  a young girl\r\n\nengaged in sex with a man.  A nurse employed by  the FBI told\r\n\ninvestigators  that in her opinion, the  girl depicted in the\r\n\nthird  photograph was less than  ten years old.   On December\r\n\n29, 1993, Chapman told Dan that he was going to scan and send\r\n\nto Dan a photograph of Chapman having anal intercourse with a\r\n\ntwelve-year-old  girl.   Chapman  then sent  to Dan  over the\r\n\ncomputer network  a photograph  depicting a man2  having anal\r\n\nintercourse with a young female who an FBI nurse later stated\r\n\nappeared to be under eighteen years old.\r\n\n          A  search of  Chapman's residence  and computer  on\r\n\nFebruary 16, 1994, pursuant to a warrant obtained by the FBI,\r\n\nturned  up  no  \"snuff  films,\" other  child  pornography  or\r\n\nscanning  equipment.   Chapman  told investigators  that  his\r\n\nstatements   to  Dan  about  sexually  abusing  children  and\r\n\npossessing  a  snuff  film  were  not true  but  were  simply\r\n\nfantasy.   Investigators were  unable to verify  that Chapman\r\n\nhad actually engaged in the sexual acts with children that he\r\n\nhad described to Dan.  Chapman admitted, however, that he had\r\n\nexposed  himself   to  minors  and   that  he  had   shown  a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The photograph showed  the man's lower torso but  not his\r\nface.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\npornographic film  to children, although the  record does not\r\n\nmake clear when these events occurred.\r\n\n          On  March 22,  1994,  Chapman was  indicted in  the\r\n\nEastern District  of Michigan  on four counts,  each charging\r\n\ninterstate  computer  transmission  of  child  pornography in\r\n\nviolation  of  18 U.S.C.    2252(a)(1).    On June  17, 1994,\r\n\nChapman pleaded  guilty in  the District of  Massachusetts to\r\n\nCount One of the indictment,  which involved the December  2,\r\n\n1993, transmission of the photograph depicting a ten-year-old\r\n\ngirl in a sexually explicit act.\r\n\n          Following  Chapman's  plea,   the  U.S.   Probation\r\n\nDepartment prepared Chapman's presentence report (the \"PSR\").\r\n\nIn  addition  to the  information  set forth  above,  the PSR\r\n\nstated that  Chapman told investigators that  he had obtained\r\n\nabout fifty pornographic  images over  the computer  network,\r\n\nand  had  engaged  in  sexually  graphic correspondence  with\r\n\nhundreds of  computer network subscribers  over the preceding\r\n\ntwo months.  Chapman objected to these statements in the PSR,\r\n\nmaintaining that he had simply told investigators that he had\r\n\naccess to fifty pornographic images over the computer network\r                  \r\n\nand  that he  had seen  hundreds of names  listed on  AOL and\r\n\nother  bulletin  boards  of  people  interested  in  sexually\r\n\ngraphic correspondence.  Chapman  also claimed in response to\r\n\nthe  PSR that he had never  \"downloaded\" the photographs sent\r\n\nto Dan,  that in fact he  had never viewed them  himself, and\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthat the December 29  photograph  depicted neither him  nor a\r\n\nminor.\r\n\n          The  PSR  also  indicated  that  Chapman  had prior\r\n\nconvictions  in  Massachusetts  for  rape and  for  lewd  and\r\n\nlascivious   behavior  arising  from   acts  involving  young\r\n\nchildren.   In  addition,  in 1981,  Chapman had  admitted to\r\n\nfacts warranting a finding  of guilt on a charge  of indecent\r\n\nexposure;  that  charge was  continued  with  supervision and\r\n\neventually dismissed.  Furthermore, the PSR stated that there\r\n\nwas  credible  evidence that  Chapman  had made  a  series of\r\n\nobscene phone  calls in 1988 to  the twelve-year-old daughter\r\n\nof one of his friends; Chapman disputed this allegation.\r\n\n          At  Chapman's sentencing  hearing on  September 27,\r\n\n1994,  the only legal issue in dispute was the application of\r\n\nU.S.S.G.     2G2.2(b)(4),   which,  under  the  category   of\r\n\n\"Specific   Offense  Characteristics,\"   states:     \"If  the\r\n\ndefendant  engaged in  a  pattern of  activity involving  the\r\n\nsexual  abuse  or  exploitation of  a  minor,  increase  by 5\r\n\nlevels.\"  The PSR recommended the application of the pattern-\r\n\nof-activity enhancement to Chapman because he had transmitted\r\n\nthree sexually  explicit photographs of minors  on December 2\r\n\nand a fourth  on December 29.  The district  court agreed and\r\n\napplied the enhancement to Chapman, stating that it based its\r\n\ndecision on \"[t]he entire record, the prior record, the other\r\n\nconduct, the  1988 incident,  the entire  record that I  have\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nbefore me, with  the exception  of [the  December 29  photo],\r\n\nwhich I accept  [defense counsel's] argument on.\"   The court\r\n\nimposed a sentence of  thirty-three months, the minimum under\r\n\nthe applicable guideline range.3  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n          Chapman  argues that  the district  court erred  in\r\n\napplying   2G2.2(b)(4)  to him because the guideline does not\r\n\npermit  consideration  of past  sexual abuse  or exploitation\r\n\nthat is unrelated to  the offense of conviction, and  because\r\n\nthe  transmission of  child  pornography by  computer is  not\r\n\n\"sexual  abuse or  exploitation\"  within the  meaning of  the\r\n\nguideline.   Thus,  Chapman challenges  the  district court's\r\n\ninterpretation  of the  meaning and  scope of  the guideline,\r\n\nwhich we  review de novo.   United States v. Powell,  50 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n94, 102 (1st Cir.  1995); United States v. Thompson,  32 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\n\n          We first consider whether the transmission of child\r\n\npornography by computer may constitute a \"pattern of activity\r\n\ninvolving the sexual abuse or exploitation  of a minor\" under\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The district  court arrived at Chapman's  sentence in the\r\nfollowing  manner:   The  Base  Offense  Level for  Chapman's\r\noffense was 15.   He  received a two-level  increase under   \r\n2G2.2(b)(1) because one of the photographs he sent involved a\r\nprepubescent  minor,  and  a  five-level   increase  under   \r\n2G2.2(b)(4).     The  court   subtracted  three  levels   for\r\nacceptance of responsibility pursuant to   3E1.1(b), bringing\r\nChapman's adjusted  offense level to 19.   Chapman's criminal\r\nhistory  placed him  in  category II,  making his  applicable\r\nguideline sentencing range thirty-three to forty-one months.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n  2G2.2(b)(4).  The  commentary to   2G2.2 explains  that the\r\n\nquoted  phrase \"means any combination of two or more separate\r\n\ninstances of the sexual abuse or the sexual exploitation of a\r\n\nminor,  whether  involving the  same  or different  victims.\"\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   2G2.2, comment. (n.4).  \"Sexual abuse\" and \"sexual\r\n\nexploitation,\"  however,  are  not   defined  in  either  the\r\n\nrelevant   sentencing   guidelines  or   their  corresponding\r\n\nstatutory  provisions.   The government  does not  argue that\r\n\ntrafficking in child pornography, by itself, is sexual abuse;\r\n\nthe question for us to decide is whether it may be considered\r\n\nsexual exploitation of a minor.\r\n\n          The most  nearly relevant dictionary  definition of\r\n\n\"exploitation\"  is  \"an unjust  or  improper  use of  another\r\n\nperson for one's  own profit or advantage.\"   Webster's Third\r                                                                         \r\n\nNew  International  Dictionary (1986).    In  a broad  sense,\r                                          \r\n\nanyone  who   chooses  to  look  at   child  pornography  has\r\n\n\"improperly  used\" the  child depicted  in the  materials and\r\n\nthus  has exploited  that  child  --  a  trafficker  in  such\r\n\nmaterials,  whether recipient or sender, all the more so.  We\r\n\ndo not  think that  Congress,4 or the  Sentencing Commission,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The  Sentencing Commission  added  subsection (b)(4)  and\r\napplication  note  4  to     2G2.2  in  1991  pursuant  to  a\r\ncongressional mandate.  See  U.S.S.G. App. C., Amendment 435;\r                                       \r\nTreasury,    Postal    Service    and   General    Government\r\nAppropriations Act of 1992, Pub. L.  No. 102-141,   632.  The\r\nlegislative  history  sheds little,  if  any,  light on  what\r\nCongress  intended  the  pattern-of-activity  enhancement  to\r\nmean.  Senators Helms and Thurmond, the amendment's sponsors,\r\nfocused on  the  need  for higher  base  offense  levels  for\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nintended  for the  word  \"exploitation\" in    2G2.2(b)(4)  to\r\n\ncarry   this  all-encompassing  meaning.     We   reach  this\r\n\nconclusion based on the interaction of subsection (b)(4) with\r\n\nother   guidelines  provisions,   and   on   the   Sentencing\r\n\nCommission's use of \"exploitation\" in other contexts.\r\n\n          The first clue to the meaning of the phrase \"sexual\r\n\nexploitation\"  is provided  by  the disparate  titles of  the\r\n\nguidelines punishing violations of 18 U.S.C.    2251-52.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nBerniger v.

The  title of  U.S.S.G.    2G2.1,  applicable  to\r\n\ncrimes related to the production of child pornography, is:\r                                            \r\n\n          Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production\r                                                 \r\n          of  Sexually  Explicit Visual  or Printed\r\n          Material:  Custodian Permitting  Minor to\r\n          Engage  in   Sexually  Explicit  Conduct:\r\n          Advertisement  for  Minors  to Engage  in\r\n          Production\r\n\n(emphasis added).

The title of    2G2.1  clearly indicates\r\n\nthat the acts to which  that guideline applies are themselves\r                                                                         \r\n\nsexual exploitation of a minor; the title of   2G2.2 suggests\r\n\nthat while  the material \"involves\" sexual  exploitation of a\r                                    \r\n\nminor, trafficking in such material does not.   If subsection\r\n\n(b)(4)  of    2G2.2  were meant  to  include the  trafficking\r\n\noffenses punishable  by that  very same guideline,  one would\r\n\nexpect that the Sentencing Commission -- either in subsection\r\n\n(b)(4) itself or  in application  note 4 --  would have  used\r\n\nlanguage that  more obviously  included those offenses.   For\r\n\nexample, application  note 4  could have defined  \"pattern of\r\n\nactivity\"  as \"any combination of two  or more acts involving\r\n\nthe  sexual abuse or sexual  exploitation of a  minor, or the\r                                                                         \r\n\ntrafficking  in, or  transportation  or receipt  of, material\r                                                                         \r\n\ninvolving such  exploitation.\"   Cf.  U.S.S.G.    2G2.4(b)(2)\r                                                \r\n\n(increasing   offense  level   of  defendants   convicted  of\r\n\npossession  of child  pornography  \"if  the offense  involved\r\n\npossessing ten or more  books, magazines, periodicals, films,\r\n\nvideo tapes,  or other  items, containing a  visual depiction\r\n\ninvolving the sexual exploitation of  a minor\").  By limiting\r\n\n\"pattern of  activity\" to \"instances  of the sexual  abuse or\r\n\nthe  sexual exploitation  of a  minor,\" in  the context  of a\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nguideline that  by its  own terms differentiates  itself from\r                                             \r\n\nanother guideline  that does  explicitly apply to  the sexual\r                                        \r\n\nexploitation  of   minors,  the  Sentencing   Commission  has\r\n\nprovided  at least  a strong  initial clue  that it  does not\r\n\nunderstand \"exploitation\" to include trafficking offenses.\r\n\n           The relevant  statutory provisions make  a similar\r\n\ndistinction.  The title of 18 U.S.C.   2251, which applies to\r\n\npersons directly involved in the  production or advertisement\r\n\nof  child pornography, is  \"Sexual exploitation of children,\"\r\n\nwhile 18 U.S.C.   2252 is titled \"Certain activities relating\r\n\nto material  involving the  sexual  exploitation of  minors.\"\r\n\nThus,  Congress  apparently  intended to  draw  a distinction\r\n\nbetween those directly engaged  in sexually exploiting minors\r\n\nand those who were engaged  in \"certain activities related to\r\n\nmaterial involving\" such exploitation.\r\n\n          The government argues  that if we are going to look\r\n\nto titles in interpreting the guideline, then  we should look\r\n\nto the title of Chapter 110 of Title 18 of the  U.S. Code, in\r\n\nwhich  all of  the  relevant child  pornography statutes  are\r\n\ngrouped -- \"Sexual Exploitation  and Other Abuse of Children\"\r\n\n-- or  to the heading  of Part 2G2  of the Guidelines,  under\r\n\nwhich  both     2G2.1 and     2G2.2  are  grouped --  \"Sexual\r\n\nExploitation  of  a  Minor.\"     These  broad  headings,  the\r\n\ngovernment   argues,   suggest    that   the   term   \"sexual\r\n\nexploitation\"   has  a  broader  meaning  than  simply  those\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\nactivities described in 18 U.S.C.   2251 or U.S.S.G.   2G2.1.\r\n\nWe  agree that  there are  some  activities not  described in\r\n\nthose provisions  that may be  considered sexual exploitation\r\n\nfor purposes of   2G2.2(b)(4); we do not agree, however, that\r                                                    \r\n\nany  activity   subsumed   within  Chapter   110,   including\r               \r\n\ntrafficking, necessarily constitutes sexual exploitation of a\r\n\nminor.   For example, the statute  prescribing record-keeping\r\n\nrequirements for the producers of sexually explicit material,\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   2257, is intended to protect  minors but does not\r                                                    \r\n\nrequire any involvement with  minors for its violation.   Yet\r\n\nit  is placed  within  Chapter  110  of  Title  18,  and  its\r\n\ncorresponding guideline,   2G2.5, is placed under the broader\r\n\nheading  of  \"Sexual  Exploitation  of  a  Minor.\"    By  the\r\n\ngovernment's reasoning, violations of   2257 would constitute\r\n\n\"sexual  exploitation   of  a   minor\"  for  purposes   of   \r\n\n2G2.2(b)(4) even  though the  violator of that  statute might\r\n\nnever  have had  any involvement  with children,  directly or\r\n\nindirectly.\r\n\n          To be sure,  the use  of titles has  its limits  in\r\n\nstatutory interpretation,5 and we  do not rely exclusively on\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  We recognize, for instance, that  neither the title of 18\r\nU.S.C.    12251A (\"Selling  or buying  of children\")  nor the\r\ntitle of  Guidelines   2G2.3 (\"Selling or  Buying of Children\r\nfor Use  in the Production of  Pornography\") expressly states\r\nthat the  acts addressed  by those provisions  constitute the\r\nsexual  exploitation of a  minor.  We would  be loath to say,\r\nhowever, that  the buying or  selling of children  for sexual\r\npurposes -- whether or not for use in the production of child\r\npornography --   could not be considered part of a pattern of\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\ntitles to interpret  the provision  at issue  here.   Indeed,\r\n\nwere there no other indicators of the Commission's intent, we\r\n\nmight  be inclined to agree  with the government.   But there\r\n\nare other indicators, and we find them to be dispositive.\r\n\n          Direct  evidence  that  the  Sentencing  Commission\r\n\ndifferentiates  between sexual  exploitation of  a minor  and\r\n\ntrafficking  in  materials  depicting  such  exploitation  is\r\n\nprovided by Amendment 372 to the Guidelines.   That amendment\r\n\ninserted  a  new  guideline,    2G2.4,  to  address  offenses\r\n\ninvolving the receipt or  possession of child pornography, as\r\n\ndistinguished  from  the trafficking  offenses  covered by   \r\n\n2G2.2.6   The  new guideline  contained, and  still contains,\r\n\ncross references to both   2G2.1 and   2G2.2.  See U.S.S.G.  \r                                                              \r\n\n2G2.4(c)(1)-(2).  The Commission explained:\r\n\n          Offenses     involving     receipt     or\r\n          transportation of [child pornography] for\r\n          the purpose of trafficking are referenced\r\n          to  2G2.2 on the  basis of the underlying\r\n          conduct (subsection  (c)(2)).  Similarly,\r\n          offenses in which the  underlying conduct\r                                                               \r\n          is more appropriately addressed as sexual\r                                                               \r\n          exploitation of a minor are referenced to\r                                                               \r\n          that guideline (subsection (c)(1)).\r                                    \r\n\nU.S.S.G.  App. C.,  Amendment  372 (emphasis  added).   \"That\r\n\nguideline\" referred to in  the quoted passage's last sentence\r\n\nis    2G2.1;  the Commission  could not  have been  much more\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nactivity of sexual exploitation.\r\n\n6.  Receipt  offenses are now covered by   2G2.2, and   2G2.4\r\napplies only to possession offenses.\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nclear  in  distinguishing \"trafficking\"  offenses  from those\r\n\n\"more appropriately  addressed  as sexual  exploitation of  a\r\n\nminor.\"    Yet, the  government  argues  that we  should  now\r\n\nascribe to the Commission an intention to include trafficking\r                                                             \r\n\noffenses  within  the  meaning  of  sexual  exploitation  for\r\n\npurposes  of    2G2.2(b)(4), even  though the  Commission has\r\n\nclearly differentiated the  two on a  previous occasion.   We\r                                  \r\n\nare  unable to find any clear evidence that the Commission in\r\n\ndrafting subsection  (b)(4)  intended to  abandon  its  prior\r\n\ndifferentiation, and we therefore will not  ascribe to it any\r\n\nsuch motive.\r\n\n          Application note 5 to   2G2.2 delivers the defining\r\n\nanswer to the government's argument.  It states:\r\n\n          If  the  defendant sexually  exploited or\r\n          abused  a minor  at any time,  whether or\r\n          not such sexual abuse occurred during the\r\n          course   of   the   offense,  an   upward\r\n          departure   may   be   warranted.      In\r\n          determining   the   extent   of  such   a\r\n          departure,  the  court  should take  into\r\n          consideration the offense levels provided\r\n          in      2A3.1,   2A3.2,  and  2A3.4  most\r\n          commensurate    with   the    defendant's\r\n          conduct, as well as whether the defendant\r\n          has   received   an   enhancement   under\r\n          subsection  (b)(4)  on  account  of  such\r\n          conduct.\r\n\nIf  we  were  to  adopt the  government's  argument  that the\r\n\ncomputer   transmission  of   child  pornography   is  sexual\r\n\nexploitation, then the first sentence of this note would mean\r\n\nthat  a court may depart upward from the guideline sentencing\r\n\nrange  for the very same  act of \"exploitation\"  -- i.e., the\r                                                          \r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\ntransmission of a photograph -- that  led to the conviction.7\r\n\nThe  Commission might  as well  draft a  sentencing guideline\r\n\napplicable  to   bank  robberies,   and  then  state   in  an\r\n\napplication  note that \"if the defendant robbed a bank at any\r\n\ntime, an upward departure may be warranted.\"  This is not how\r\n\nthe guidelines are meant to operate; departures are permitted\r\n\nonly  if \"an  aggravating or  mitigating circumstance  exists\r\n\nthat  was  not adequately  taken  into  consideration by  the\r\n\nSentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines  and that\r\n\nshould result  in a sentence different  from that described.\"\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   3553(b).   Yet the application note  says nothing\r\n\nabout an aggravating circumstance;  if trafficking is  sexual\r\n\nexploitation, then trafficking alone, without any aggravating\r                                                         \r\n\ncircumstances, permits a judge to  depart upward.  This makes\r\n\nno  sense:   An  offense  specifically  punishable under  the\r\n\nguideline cannot at  the same time be  \"an aggravating .  . .\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  The Commission  inserted the words \"exploited  or\" in the\r\nfirst sentence of  application note  5 in 1991,  at the  same\r\ntime  it  added  subsection (b)(4)  to  the  guideline.   See\r                                                                         \r\nU.S.S.G. App.  C., Amendment  435 (effective Nov.  27, 1991).\r\nIt did not amend the second clause of that sentence (\"whether\r                      \r\nor not  such sexual abuse . . . \"),  nor did it insert in the\r                                     \r\nfollowing sentence a reference to the guideline applicable to\r\nsexual  exploitation.   One might  argue that  the Commission\r\nomitted  any  such  reference  intentionally,  intending  for\r\nsexual exploitation to include  more crimes than those listed\r                                                \r\nin    2G2.1.  We do not believe, however, that the Commission\r\nintended  to open  the  door  for  departures  based  on  any\r                                                                         \r\nactivity   that   might   conceivably   be   labeled   sexual\r\nexploitation; it had  something more specific  in mind.   Our\r\nbest estimate  of what \"something more  specific\" encompasses\r\nis guided by the Commission's past usage of the term.\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\ncircumstance .  . . not adequately  taken into consideration\"\r\n\nby  the  Commission; indeed,  if  the  offense  may also,  by\r\n\nitself,  warrant  an  upward  departure,  then  the guideline\r\n\nserves  no useful  purpose.    Thus,  we must  conclude  that\r\n\n\"sexually  exploited,\" as  used in  application note  5 of   \r\n\n2G2.2  to warrant  an upward  departure, must  mean something\r                                                         \r\n\ndifferent than the substantive offenses punishable under that\r\n\nguideline.\r\n\n          The  government argues  that the  interpretation of\r\n\nsubsection (b)(4)  that we adopt will  render the pattern-of-\r\n\nactivity enhancement virtually useless, and that therefore we\r\n\nshould  breathe  life into  it  by  assigning it  some  other\r\n\nmeaning.  For example, a defendant convicted of a trafficking\r\n\noffense, but whose offense  involved a pattern of production-\r\n\nrelated  activity  sufficient  under  our  interpretation  to\r\n\nwarrant  the enhancement under  subsection (b)(4),  would, in\r\n\naccordance  with the  cross  reference of    2G2.2(c)(1),  be\r\n\nsentenced  under  the   guideline  applicable  to  production\r\n\noffenses,     2G2.1,  if  his resulting  offense  level  were\r\n\ngreater than that  under    2G2.2.  Section  2G2.1 carries  a\r\n\nbase offense level of 25, compared to a base offense level of\r\n\njust 15 under    2G2.2; the only way a  trafficker could ever\r\n\nreceive a higher  offense level  under   2G2.2  than under   \r\n\n2G2.1 would  be if  his offense involved  distribution (five-\r\n\nlevel  increase;    2G2.2(b)(2))  and  the material  involved\r                                                 \r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nportrayed   sadistic   or  masochistic   conduct  (four-level\r\n\nincrease;    2G2.2(b)(3)),  and he  received  the  five-level\r\n\npattern-of-activity enhancement (bringing  his total  offense\r\n\nlevel  to 29).  It  is unlikely, the  government argues, that\r\n\nCongress intended the pattern-of-activity enhancement to have\r\n\nsuch limited  applicability, and therefore we  should broaden\r\n\nits  applicability by  construing  \"sexual  exploitation\"  to\r\n\ninclude trafficking in child pornography.\r\n\n          But  there may well  be activities  that constitute\r\n\nsexual  exploitation,  as  used  in  subsection  (b)(4), that\r\n\nneither  implicate the cross reference to   2G2.1 nor clearly\r\n\nrise  to the  level  of sexual  abuse.8   And, in  any event,\r\n\nwhile the  limited applicability of subsection  (b)(4) may be\r\n\ntroubling, it would be more troubling to interpret the phrase\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  To offer  but a single  example, imagine  a recipient  or\r\nsender of  child  pornography  who,  in  the  course  of  his\r\nactivities, associates with teenagers who engage in \"sexually\r\nexplicit  conduct\"  as  defined  at 18  U.S.C.     2256(2)(E)\r\n(\"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic  area of any\r\nperson\"), but who neither has physical contact with them  nor\r\nphotographs  them.   This  offender should  not be  sentenced\r\nunder    2G2.1; nevertheless,  he has clearly  made \"improper\r\nuse\"  of the minors for his own sexual gratification:  he has\r\nexploited them.\r\n          The  enhancement also has  obvious applicability in\r\ncases  involving sexual  abuse.   Section  2G2.2 contains  no\r\ncross-reference  for a  defendant  whose trafficking  offense\r\nalso involved sexual abuse.  While application note 5 permits\r\na sentencing  judge to  depart upward in  such circumstances,\r\nand directs his or her attention to the guidelines applicable\r\nto sexual abuse in determining  the appropriate extent of any\r\ndeparture,  subsection  (b)(4)  substantially  increases  the\r\nsentence of a defendant  who has engaged in two  instances of\r\nsexual abuse  without requiring an exercise  of discretion on\r                                 \r\nthe part of the judge.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n\"sexual exploitation\" in  a novel  manner solely  to give  it\r\n\nwider applicability.    Moreover, the  government's  solution\r\n\nwould  result in  a subsection  that, on  its face,  enhances\r\n\npunishment for  a  pattern-of-activity  of  sexual  abuse  or\r\n\nexploitation,   but  that  in   practice  primarily  enhances\r\n\npunishment  for  traffickers.     This  can  hardly  be  what\r\n\nCongress, or the Commission,  intended when they included the\r\n\nphrase  \"sexual abuse  or exploitation.\"   Had  they intended\r\n\nsuch a  result, they  would have listed  the trafficking-type\r\n\noffenses.  Both Congress and the Commission had opportunities\r\n\nto make clear  that they intended trafficking offenses  to be\r\n\nincluded in \"sexual  exploitation.\"  Neither chose  to do so.\r\n\nSince  both Congress  and the  Commission have  distinguished\r\n\ntrafficking  from \"sexual  exploitation\" previously,  we will\r\n\nnot  now  construe  that  phrase  otherwise  merely  to  give\r\n\nsubsection (b)(4) wider applicability.\r\n\n          Our  interpretation  of  subsection  (b)(4)  is  at\r\n\nvariance   with   the   only   previous   reported   decision\r\n\ninterpreting the provision.   In United States v.  Surratt, a\r                                                                      \r\n\ndistrict  court  suggested  in  dictum that  the  pattern  of\r\n\nactivity enhancement  might apply  to \"a pattern  of ordering\r\n\nchild pornography through the mail.\"  867 F. Supp. 1317, 1320\r\n\n(N.D. Ohio 1994).  We think this dictum is  simply wrong, for\r\n\nall the reasons discussed above.\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\n          Having decided that sexual exploitation, as used in\r\n\nsubsection (b)(4), does not include the computer transmission\r\n\nof child pornography, we pause to consider whether the record\r\n\nwould allow us  to conclude that  the district court  applied\r\n\nthe  pattern-of-activity enhancement  based on  at  least two\r\n\ninstances of offense-related activity  other than the receipt\r                                                        \r\n\nor  transmission of child pornography.  Were we able to reach\r\n\nthis  conclusion,  it  would  not be  necessary  to  consider\r\n\nwhether  the activity contemplated  by subsection (b)(4) must\r\n\nin  fact   be  offense-related,  for   the  district  court's\r\n\nconsideration of other sexual  abuse or exploitation would be\r\n\nharmless.  A careful review  of the record, however, provides\r\n\nno basis for such a conclusion.  While Chapman, in the course\r\n\nof  transmitting  photographs  to Dan,  boasted  of  sexually\r\n\nabusing children  and discussed how  he and Dan  could commit\r\n\nunspeakable  atrocities against a  young girl, the government\r\n\nfound no evidence that  Chapman actually committed or planned\r\n\nto  commit such  acts.   Similarly, although  Chapman boasted\r\n\nthat the December 29 photograph depicted him engaging in anal\r\n\nintercourse  with a young girl, the district court found that\r\n\nthat  photograph  did  not  even  depict  a  minor,  and  the\r\n\ngovernment  offered  no  other  evidence   that  Chapman  had\r\n\nproduced  any  child  pornography.   Thus,  while  there  was\r\n\nconsiderable  evidence  that  Chapman had  transmitted  child\r\n\npornography   on  numerous  occasions,  and  had  engaged  in\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\ndetailed conversations about sexually abusing, and murdering,\r\n\nyoung children, the record contains insufficient  evidence to\r\n\nconclude,  even on  a  preponderance standard,  that  Chapman\r\n\nactually sexually abused  or exploited minors  in conjunction\r\n\nwith  his trafficking offense (or even during the time he was\r\n\nan AOL subscriber).   Consequently, we have no choice  but to\r\n\nconsider   whether  the   district  court   was  correct   in\r\n\nconsidering  Chapman's past  activity in  applying subsection\r\n\n(b)(4).9       While  we disagree  with  the Surratt  court's\r                                                                \r\n\ndictum, we  fully endorse its holding  that subsection (b)(4)\r\n\nis  inapplicable  to   past  sexual  abuse   or  exploitation\r\n\nunrelated  to the offense of conviction.  See Surratt, 867 F.\r                                                                 \r\n\nSupp.  at 1320.  In  Surratt, the defendant  was convicted on\r                                        \r\n\none count of  receiving child pornography in  violation of 18\r\n\nU.S.C.   2252(a)(2); during a search of the defendant's home,\r\n\nthe  government discovered  other  videotapes  depicting  the\r\n\ndefendant sexually abusing his  own daughter.  Id.   Based on\r                                                              \r\n\nthis past  sexual abuse, the  government sought a  pattern of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.  The government does not strongly argue that past activity\r\nshould  be considered under  subsection (b)(4);  it maintains\r\ninstead that the district  court's consideration of Chapman's\r\nprevious activity  was \"harmless error  if error at  all,\" in\r\nlight of  Chapman's multiple computer transmissions  of child\r\npornography.    However,  because  we  have  ruled  that  the\r\ntransmissions  themselves  do  not  constitute  instances  of\r\nsexual  exploitation and  that the  record provides  no other\r\nbasis  on  which the  district court  could have  applied the\r\npattern-of-activity enhancement  for offense-related conduct,\r\nwe must consider whether  it was proper to look  to previous,\r\nnon-offense-related conduct.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nactivity enhancement under  subsection (b)(4).   The  Surratt\r                                                                         \r\n\ncourt declined to apply the enhancement, stating:\r\n\n          The   heading   of   subsection  (b)   is\r\n          \"Specific  Offense Characteristics.\"   In\r\n          other  words,  enhancements  included  in\r\n          subsection  (b)  are  available when,  as\r                                                               \r\n          part  of the  offense of  conviction, the\r                                                          \r\n          defendant  undertakes the  actions listed\r\n          therein.\r\n               The    government     argues    that\r\n          subsection   (b)(4)  is   different  from\r\n          subsections  (b)(1),   (b)(2)  or  (b)(3)\r\n          because  it  does  not  begin   with  the\r\n          language \"If the offense  involved . .  .\r\n          .\"   This  argument is  unavailing.   The\r\n          government appears to be  suggesting that\r\n          if the  defendant ever engaged  in such a\r                                            \r\n          pattern of  behavior, whether as  part of\r\n          the  charged offense  or at  a completely\r\n          different   time  or   place,  subsection\r\n          (b)(4) should  apply.  This  Court cannot\r\n          agree.  If the Sentencing  Commission had\r\n          not   intended   for   the  language   of\r\n          subsection (b)(4)  to be applied  only to\r\n          the specific offense of  conviction, that\r\n          language   would   not  be   included  in\r\n          subsection   (b),    entitled   \"Specific\r\n          Offense Characteristics.\"  The government\r\n          has pointed to no persuasive authority to\r\n          convince the Court that \"specific offense\r\n          characteristic\" means anything other than\r\n          characteristics  specific to  the offense\r\n          of conviction.\r\n\nId. (emphasis added).\r               \r\n\n          We agree  with this  reasoning.  If  the Commission\r\n\nintended  for  subsection (b)(4)  to  apply  to any  previous\r                                                               \r\n\nsexual abuse or exploitation, while at the same time  placing\r\n\nthe  provision under  \"Specific Offense  Characteristics,\" we\r\n\nwould expect that it would have taken efforts to resolve this\r\n\nglaring  contradiction.

Chapman pled guilty to one count of transporting child pornography in interstate commerce in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252(a)(1) and was sentenced to thirty-three months incarceration.  Chapman appeals his sentence, challenging the district court's application of a five-level \"pattern of activity\" enhancement under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From November 1993 until at least January 1994, Chapman, of Southbridge, Massachusetts, subscribed to the America On-Line (AOL) computer information network.  During that time, Chapman communicated via computer and telephone with an AOL subscriber in Michigan (a cooperating witness referred to by the government as \"Dan\") about Chapman's sexual interest in children.  Chapman told Dan about having had sexual relations with children as young as seven years, and discussed with Dan the possibility of abducting a young girl, bringing her to Michigan where both men would have sex with her, and then killing her.  Chapman also told Dan that he possessed a \"snuff film\" depicting the rape and murder of a ten-year-old girl, as well as other child pornography.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 2, 1993, Chapman sent Dan three photographs via the computer network, each with a different file designation.  Two of the pictures depicted nude or partially nude girls, while the third depicted a young girl engaged in sex with a man.  A nurse employed by the FBI told investigators that in her opinion, the girl depicted in the third photograph was less than ten years old.  On December 29, 1993, Chapman told Dan that he was going to scan and send to Dan a photograph of Chapman having anal intercourse with a twelve-year-old girl.  Chapman then sent to Dan over the computer network a photograph depicting a man<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> having anal intercourse with a young female who an FBI nurse later stated appeared to be under eighteen years old.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A search of Chapman's residence and computer on February 16, 1994, pursuant to a warrant obtained by the FBI, turned up no \"snuff films,\" other child pornography or scanning equipment.  Chapman told investigators that his statements to Dan about sexually abusing children and possessing a snuff film were not true but were simply fantasy.  Investigators were unable to verify that Chapman had actually engaged in the sexual acts with children that he had described to Dan.  Chapman admitted, however, that he had exposed himself to minors and that he had shown a pornographic film to children, although the record does not make clear when these events occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 1994, Chapman was indicted in the Eastern District of Michigan on four counts, each charging interstate computer transmission of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252(a)(1).  On June 17, 1994, Chapman pleaded guilty in the District of Massachusetts to Count One of the indictment, which involved the December 2, 1993, transmission of the photograph depicting a ten-year-old girl in a sexually explicit act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Chapman's plea, the U.S. Probation Department prepared Chapman's presentence report (the \"PSR\").  In addition to the information set forth above, the PSR stated that Chapman told investigators that he had obtained about fifty pornographic images over the computer network, and had engaged in sexually graphic correspondence with hundreds of computer network subscribers over the preceding two months.  Chapman objected to these statements in the PSR, maintaining that he had simply told investigators that he had access to fifty pornographic images over the computer network and that he had seen hundreds of names listed on AOL and other bulletin boards of people interested in sexually graphic correspondence.  Chapman also claimed in response to the PSR that he had never \"downloaded\" the photographs sent to Dan, that in fact he had never viewed them himself, and that the December 29 photograph depicted neither him nor a minor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR also indicated that Chapman had prior convictions in Massachusetts for rape and for lewd and lascivious behavior arising from acts involving young children.  In addition, in 1981, Chapman had admitted to facts warranting a finding of guilt on a charge of indecent exposure;  that charge was continued with supervision and eventually dismissed.  Furthermore, the PSR stated that there was credible evidence that Chapman had made a series of obscene phone calls in 1988 to the twelve-year-old daughter of one of his friends;  Chapman disputed this allegation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Chapman's sentencing hearing on September 27, 1994, the only legal issue in dispute was the application of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4), which, under the category of \"Specific Offense Characteristics,\" states:  \"If the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor, increase by 5 levels.\"   The PSR recommended the application of the pattern-of-activity enhancement to Chapman because he had transmitted three sexually explicit photographs of minors on December 2 and a fourth on December 29.  The district court agreed and applied the enhancement to Chapman, stating that it based its decision on \"[t]he entire record, the prior record, the other conduct, the 1988 incident, the entire record that I have before me, with the exception of [the December 29 photo], which I accept [defense counsel's] argument on.\"   The court imposed a sentence of thirty-three months, the minimum under the applicable guideline range.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman argues that the district court erred in applying Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4) to him because the guideline does not permit consideration of past sexual abuse or exploitation that is unrelated to the offense of conviction, and because the transmission of child pornography by computer is not \"sexual abuse or exploitation\" within the meaning of the guideline.  Thus, Chapman challenges the district court's interpretation of the meaning and scope of the guideline, which we review de novo.  United States v. Powell, 50 F.3d 94, 102 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Thompson, 32 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first consider whether the transmission of child pornography by computer may constitute a \"pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor\" under Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4).  The commentary to Sec. 2G2.2 explains that the quoted phrase \"means any combination of two or more separate instances of the sexual abuse or the sexual exploitation of a minor, whether involving the same or different victims.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.2, comment.  (n. 4).  \"Sexual abuse\" and \"sexual exploitation,\" however, are not defined in either the relevant sentencing guidelines or their corresponding statutory provisions.  The government does not argue that trafficking in child pornography, by itself, is sexual abuse;  the question for us to decide is whether it may be considered sexual exploitation of a minor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most nearly relevant dictionary definition of \"exploitation\" is \"an unjust or improper use of another person for one's own profit or advantage.\"   Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1986).  In a broad sense, anyone who chooses to look at child pornography has \"improperly used\" the child depicted in the materials and thus has exploited that child--a trafficker in such materials, whether recipient or sender, all the more so.  We do not think that Congress,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> or the Sentencing Commission, intended for the word \"exploitation\" in Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4) to carry this all-encompassing meaning.  We reach this conclusion based on the interaction of subsection (b)(4) with other guidelines provisions, and on the Sentencing Commission's use of \"exploitation\" in other contexts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first clue to the meaning of the phrase \"sexual exploitation\" is provided by the disparate titles of the guidelines punishing violations of 18 U.S.C. Secs. 2251-52.  See Berniger v. Meadow Green-Wildcat Corp., 945 F.2d 4, 9 (1st Cir.1991) (titles may aid in construing any ambiguities in a statute).  The title of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.1, applicable to crimes related to the production of child pornography, is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material:  Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct:  Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).  The title of Sec. 2G2.2 is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor;  Receiving, Transporting, Shipping, or Advertising Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor;  Possessing Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).  The title of Sec. 2G2.1 clearly indicates that the acts to which that guideline applies are themselves sexual exploitation of a minor;  the title of Sec. 2G2.2 suggests that while the material \"involves\" sexual exploitation of a minor, trafficking in such material does not.  If subsection (b)(4) of Sec. 2G2.2 were meant to include the trafficking offenses punishable by that very same guideline, one would expect that the Sentencing Commission--either in subsection (b)(4) itself or in application note 4--would have used language that more obviously included those offenses.  For example, application note 4 could have defined \"pattern of activity\" as \"any combination of two or more acts involving the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor, or the trafficking in, or transportation or receipt of, material involving such exploitation.\"   Cf. U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.4(b)(2) (increasing offense level of defendants convicted of possession of child pornography \"if the offense involved possessing ten or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes, or other items, containing a visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor\").  By limiting \"pattern of activity\" to \"instances of the sexual abuse or the sexual exploitation of a minor,\" in the context of a guideline that by its own terms differentiates itself from another guideline that does explicitly apply to the sexual exploitation of minors, the Sentencing Commission has provided at least a strong initial clue that it does not understand \"exploitation\" to include trafficking offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant statutory provisions make a similar distinction.  The title of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2251, which applies to persons directly involved in the production or advertisement of child pornography, is \"Sexual exploitation of children,\" while 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252 is titled \"Certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors.\"   Thus, Congress apparently intended to draw a distinction between those directly engaged in sexually exploiting minors and those who were engaged in \"certain activities related to material involving\" such exploitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that if we are going to look to titles in interpreting the guideline, then we should look to the title of Chapter 110 of Title 18 of the U.S.Code, in which all of the relevant child pornography statutes are grouped--\"Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children\"--or to the heading of Part 2G2 of the Guidelines, under which both Sec. 2G2.1 and Sec. 2G2.2 are grouped--\"Sexual Exploitation of a Minor.\"   These broad headings, the government argues, suggest that the term \"sexual exploitation\" has a broader meaning than simply those activities described in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2251 or U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.1.  We agree that there are some activities not described in those provisions that may be considered sexual exploitation for purposes of Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4);  we do not agree, however, that any activity subsumed within Chapter 110, including trafficking, necessarily constitutes sexual exploitation of a minor.  For example, the statute prescribing record-keeping requirements for the producers of sexually explicit material, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2257, is intended to protect minors but does not require any involvement with minors for its violation.  Yet it is placed within Chapter 110 of Title 18, and its corresponding guideline, Sec. 2G2.5, is placed under the broader heading of \"Sexual Exploitation of a Minor.\"   By the government's reasoning, violations of Sec. 2257 would constitute \"sexual exploitation of a minor\" for purposes of Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4) even though the violator of that statute might never have had any involvement with children, directly or indirectly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the use of titles has its limits in statutory interpretation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and we do not rely exclusively on titles to interpret the provision at issue here.  Indeed, were there no other indicators of the Commission's intent, we might be inclined to agree with the government.  But there are other indicators, and we find them to be dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Direct evidence that the Sentencing Commission differentiates between sexual exploitation of a minor and trafficking in materials depicting such exploitation is provided by Amendment 372 to the Guidelines.  That amendment inserted a new guideline, Sec. 2G2.4, to address offenses involving the receipt or possession of child pornography, as distinguished from the trafficking offenses covered by Sec. 2G2.2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The new guideline contained, and still contains, cross references to both Sec. 2G2.1 and Sec. 2G2.2.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.4(c)(1)-(2).  The Commission explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Offenses involving receipt or transportation of [child pornography] for the purpose of trafficking are referenced to Sec. 2G2.2 on the basis of the underlying conduct (subsection (c)(2)).  Similarly, offenses in which the underlying conduct is more appropriately addressed as sexual exploitation of a minor are referenced to that guideline (subsection (c)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. App.  C., Amendment 372 (emphasis added).  \"That guideline\" referred to in the quoted passage's last sentence is Sec. 2G2.1;  the Commission could not have been much more clear in distinguishing \"trafficking\" offenses from those \"more appropriately addressed as sexual exploitation of a minor.\"   Yet, the government argues that we should now ascribe to the Commission an intention to include trafficking offenses within the meaning of sexual exploitation for purposes of Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4), even though the Commission has clearly differentiated the two on a previous occasion.  We are unable to find any clear evidence that the Commission in drafting subsection (b)(4) intended to abandon its prior differentiation, and we therefore will not ascribe to it any such motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application note 5 to Sec. 2G2.2 delivers the defining answer to the government's argument.  It states:If the defendant sexually exploited or abused a minor at any time, whether or not such sexual abuse occurred during the course of the offense, an upward departure may be warranted.  In determining the extent of such a departure, the court should take into consideration the offense levels provided in Secs. 2A3.1, 2A3.2, and 2A3.4 most commensurate with the defendant's conduct, as well as whether the defendant has received an enhancement under subsection (b)(4) on account of such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were to adopt the government's argument that the computer transmission of child pornography is sexual exploitation, then the first sentence of this note would mean that a court may depart upward from the guideline sentencing range for the very same act of \"exploitation \"--i.e., the transmission of a photograph--that led to the conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The Commission might as well draft a sentencing guideline applicable to bank robberies, and then state in an application note that \"if the defendant robbed a bank at any time, an upward departure may be warranted.\"   This is not how the guidelines are meant to operate;  departures are permitted only if \"an aggravating or mitigating circumstance exists that was not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines and that should result in a sentence different from that described.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b).  Yet the application note says nothing about an aggravating circumstance;  if trafficking is sexual exploitation, then trafficking alone, without any aggravating circumstances, permits a judge to depart upward.  This makes no sense:  An offense specifically punishable under the guideline cannot at the same time be \"an aggravating ... circumstance ... not adequately taken into consideration\" by the Commission;  indeed, if the offense may also, by itself, warrant an upward departure, then the guideline serves no useful purpose.  Thus, we must conclude that \"sexually exploited,\" as used in application note 5 of Sec. 2G2.2 to warrant an upward departure, must mean something different than the substantive offenses punishable under that guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the interpretation of subsection (b)(4) that we adopt will render the pattern-of-activity enhancement virtually useless, and that therefore we should breathe life into it by assigning it some other meaning.  For example, a defendant convicted of a trafficking offense, but whose offense involved a pattern of production-related activity sufficient under our interpretation to warrant the enhancement under subsection (b)(4), would, in accordance with the cross reference of Sec. 2G2.2(c)(1), be sentenced under the guideline applicable to production offenses, Sec. 2G2.1, if his resulting offense level were greater than that under Sec. 2G2.2.  Section 2G2.1 carries a base offense level of 25, compared to a base offense level of just 15 under Sec. 2G2.2;  the only way a trafficker could ever receive a higher offense level under Sec. 2G2.2 than under Sec. 2G2.1 would be if his offense involved distribution (five-level increase;  Sec. 2G2.2(b)(2)) and the material involved portrayed sadistic or masochistic conduct (four-level increase;  Sec. 2G2.2(b)(3)), and he received the five-level pattern-of-activity enhancement (bringing his total offense level to 29).  It is unlikely, the government argues, that Congress intended the pattern-of-activity enhancement to have such limited applicability, and therefore we should broaden its applicability by construing \"sexual exploitation\" to include trafficking in child pornography.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But there may well be activities that constitute sexual exploitation, as used in subsection (b)(4), that neither implicate the cross reference to Sec. 2G2.1 nor clearly rise to the level of sexual abuse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  And, in any event, while the limited applicability of subsection (b)(4) may be troubling, it would be more troubling to interpret the phrase \"sexual exploitation\" in a novel manner solely to give it wider applicability.  Moreover, the government's solution would result in a subsection that, on its face, enhances punishment for a pattern-of-activity of sexual abuse or exploitation, but that in practice primarily enhances punishment for traffickers.  This can hardly be what Congress, or the Commission, intended when they included the phrase \"sexual abuse or exploitation.\"   Had they intended such a result, they would have listed the trafficking-type offenses.  Both Congress and the Commission had opportunities to make clear that they intended trafficking offenses to be included in \"sexual exploitation.\"   Neither chose to do so.  Since both Congress and the Commission have distinguished trafficking from \"sexual exploitation\" previously, we will not now construe that phrase otherwise merely to give subsection (b)(4) wider applicability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our interpretation of subsection (b)(4) is at variance with the only previous reported decision interpreting the provision.  In United States v. Surratt, a district court suggested in dictum that the pattern of activity enhancement might apply to \"a pattern of ordering child pornography through the mail.\"  867 F.Supp. 1317, 1320 (N.D.Ohio 1994).  We think this dictum is simply wrong, for all the reasons discussed above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having decided that sexual exploitation, as used in subsection (b)(4), does not include the computer transmission of child pornography, we pause to consider whether the record would allow us to conclude that the district court applied the pattern-of-activity enhancement based on at least two instances of offense-related activity other than the receipt or transmission of child pornography.  Were we able to reach this conclusion, it would not be necessary to consider whether the activity contemplated by subsection (b)(4) must in fact be offense-related, for the district court's consideration of other sexual abuse or exploitation would be harmless.  A careful review of the record, however, provides no basis for such a conclusion.  While Chapman, in the course of transmitting photographs to Dan, boasted of sexually abusing children and discussed how he and Dan could commit unspeakable atrocities against a young girl, the government found no evidence that Chapman actually committed or planned to commit such acts.  Similarly, although Chapman boasted that the December 29 photograph depicted him engaging in anal intercourse with a young girl, the district court found that that photograph did not even depict a minor, and the government offered no other evidence that Chapman had produced any child pornography.  Thus, while there was considerable evidence that Chapman had transmitted child pornography on numerous occasions, and had engaged in detailed conversations about sexually abusing, and murdering, young children, the record contains insufficient evidence to conclude, even on a preponderance standard, that Chapman actually sexually abused or exploited minors in conjunction with his trafficking offense (or even during the time he was an AOL subscriber).  Consequently, we have no choice but to consider whether the district court was correct in considering Chapman's past activity in applying subsection (b)(4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  While we disagree with the Surratt court's dictum, we fully endorse its holding that subsection (b)(4) is inapplicable to past sexual abuse or exploitation unrelated to the offense of conviction.  See Surratt, 867 F.Supp. at 1320.   In Surratt, the defendant was convicted on one count of receiving child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252(a)(2);  during a search of the defendant's home, the government discovered other videotapes depicting the defendant sexually abusing his own daughter.  Id.  Based on this past sexual abuse, the government sought a pattern of activity enhancement under subsection (b)(4).  The Surratt court declined to apply the enhancement, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>The heading of subsection (b) is \"Specific Offense Characteristics.\"   In other words, enhancements included in subsection (b) are available when, as part of the offense of conviction, the defendant undertakes the actions listed therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that subsection (b)(4) is different from subsections (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) because it does not begin with the language \"If the offense involved....\"  This argument is unavailing.  The government appears to be suggesting that if the defendant ever engaged in such a pattern of behavior, whether as part of the charged offense or at a completely different time or place, subsection (b)(4) should apply.  This Court cannot agree.  If the Sentencing Commission had not intended for the language of subsection (b)(4) to be applied only to the specific offense of conviction, that language would not be included in subsection (b), entitled \"Specific Offense Characteristics.\"   The government has pointed to no persuasive authority to convince the Court that \"specific offense characteristic\" means anything other than characteristics specific to the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with this reasoning.  If the Commission intended for subsection (b)(4) to apply to any previous sexual abuse or exploitation, while at the same time placing the provision under \"Specific Offense Characteristics,\" we would expect that it would have taken efforts to resolve this glaring contradiction.  It clearly knew how to do so:  Application Note 5 states in no uncertain terms that an upward departure is warranted for any instance of sexual exploitation or abuse \"whether or not such sexual abuse occurred during the course of the offense.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Cf. U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(1)-(2) (stating clearly that defendant's base offense level must be increased if defendant \"previously\" was deported after conviction for felony or aggravated felony).  The absence of similar language in subsection (b)(4), combined with the fact that the subsection is classified under the rubric of \"Specific Offense Characteristics,\" compels the conclusion that the application of the subsection does require that the pattern of activity relate to the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all the foregoing reasons, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> All references to the Sentencing Guidelines, unless otherwise noted, are to the 1993 Guidelines Manual</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The photograph showed the man's lower torso but not his face</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court arrived at Chapman's sentence in the following manner:  The Base Offense Level for Chapman's offense was 15.  He received a two-level increase under Sec. 2G2.2(b)(1) because one of the photographs he sent involved a prepubescent minor, and a five-level increase under Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4).  The court subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to Sec. 3E1.1(b), bringing Chapman's adjusted offense level to 19.  Chapman's criminal history placed him in category II, making his applicable guideline sentencing range thirty-three to forty-one months</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Sentencing Commission added subsection (b)(4) and application note 4 to Sec. 2G2.2 in 1991 pursuant to a congressional mandate.  See U.S.S.G. App.  C., Amendment 435;  Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act of 1992, Pub.L. No. 102-141, Sec. 632.  The legislative history sheds little, if any, light on what Congress intended the pattern-of-activity enhancement to mean.  Senators Helms and Thurmond, the amendment's sponsors, focused on the need for higher base offense levels for purveyors and possessors of child pornography (the base offense levels for possessors and recipients of child pornography were, respectively, 10 and 13 at the time), and on the link between child pornography and sexual abuse.  See 137 Cong.Rec. S10322-33 (daily ed. July 18, 1991) (statements of Senators Helms and Thurmond).  In relevant part, section 632 of the Act ordered the Sentencing Commission to amend Sec. 2G2.2 \"to provide a base offense level of not less than 15 and to provide at least a 5 level increase for offenders who have engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We recognize, for instance, that neither the title of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 12251A (\"Selling or buying of children\") nor the title of Guidelines Sec. 2G2.3 (\"Selling or Buying of Children for Use in the Production of Pornography\") expressly states that the acts addressed by those provisions constitute the sexual exploitation of a minor.  We would be loath to say, however, that the buying or selling of children for sexual purposes--whether or not for use in the production of child pornography--could not be considered part of a pattern of activity of sexual exploitation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Receipt offenses are now covered by Sec. 2G2.2, and Sec. 2G2.4 applies only to possession offenses</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Commission inserted the words \"exploited or\" in the first sentence of application note 5 in 1991, at the same time it added subsection (b)(4) to the guideline.  See U.S.S.G. App.  C., Amendment 435 (effective Nov. 27, 1991).  It did not amend the second clause of that sentence (\"whether or not such sexual abuse ... \"), nor did it insert in the following sentence a reference to the guideline applicable to sexual exploitation.  One might argue that the Commission omitted any such reference intentionally, intending for sexual exploitation to include more crimes than those listed in Sec. 2G2.1.  We do not believe, however, that the Commission intended to open the door for departures based on any activity that might conceivably be labeled sexual exploitation;  it had something more specific in mind.  Our best estimate of what \"something more specific\" encompasses is guided by the Commission's past usage of the term</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> To offer but a single example, imagine a recipient or sender of child pornography who, in the course of his activities, associates with teenagers who engage in \"sexually explicit conduct\" as defined at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256(2)(E) (\"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person\"), but who neither has physical contact with them nor photographs them.  This offender should not be sentenced under Sec. 2G2.1;  nevertheless, he has clearly made \"improper use\" of the minors for his own sexual gratification:  he has exploited them</p>\n        <p>The enhancement also has obvious applicability in cases involving sexual abuse.  Section 2G2.2 contains no cross-reference for a defendant whose trafficking offense also involved sexual abuse.  While application note 5 permits a sentencing judge to depart upward in such circumstances, and directs his or her attention to the guidelines applicable to sexual abuse in determining the appropriate extent of any departure, subsection (b)(4) substantially increases the sentence of a defendant who has engaged in two instances of sexual abuse without requiring an exercise of discretion on the part of the judge.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The government does not strongly argue that past activity should be considered under subsection (b)(4);  it maintains instead that the district court's consideration of Chapman's previous activity was \"harmless error if error at all,\" in light of Chapman's multiple computer transmissions of child pornography.  However, because we have ruled that the transmissions themselves do not constitute instances of sexual exploitation and that the record provides no other basis on which the district court could have applied the pattern-of-activity enhancement for offense-related conduct, we must consider whether it was proper to look to previous, non-offense-related conduct</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The district court could have invoked this application note and departed upward based on Chapman's previous sexual abuse of minors</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Chapman appeals his sentence, challenging the district court's application of a five-level \"pattern of activity\" enhancement under U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  We vacate the sentence imposed by the district court and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From November 1993 until at least January 1994, Chapman, of Southbridge, Massachusetts, subscribed to the America On-Line (AOL) computer information network.  During that time, Chapman communicated via computer and telephone with an AOL subscriber in Michigan (a cooperating witness referred to by the government as \"Dan\") about Chapman's sexual interest in children.  Chapman told Dan about having had sexual relations with children as young as seven years, and discussed with Dan the possibility of abducting a young girl, bringing her to Michigan where both men would have sex with her, and then killing her.  Chapman also told Dan that he possessed a \"snuff film\" depicting the rape and murder of a ten-year-old girl, as well as other child pornography.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 2, 1993, Chapman sent Dan three photographs via the computer network, each with a different file designation.  Two of the pictures depicted nude or partially nude girls, while the third depicted a young girl engaged in sex with a man.  A nurse employed by the FBI told investigators that in her opinion, the girl depicted in the third photograph was less than ten years old.  On December 29, 1993, Chapman told Dan that he was going to scan and send to Dan a photograph of Chapman having anal intercourse with a twelve-year-old girl.  Chapman then sent to Dan over the computer network a photograph depicting a man<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> having anal intercourse with a young female who an FBI nurse later stated appeared to be under eighteen years old.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A search of Chapman's residence and computer on February 16, 1994, pursuant to a warrant obtained by the FBI, turned up no \"snuff films,\" other child pornography or scanning equipment.  Chapman told investigators that his statements to Dan about sexually abusing children and possessing a snuff film were not true but were simply fantasy.  Investigators were unable to verify that Chapman had actually engaged in the sexual acts with children that he had described to Dan.  Chapman admitted, however, that he had exposed himself to minors and that he had shown a pornographic film to children, although the record does not make clear when these events occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 22, 1994, Chapman was indicted in the Eastern District of Michigan on four counts, each charging interstate computer transmission of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252(a)(1).  On June 17, 1994, Chapman pleaded guilty in the District of Massachusetts to Count One of the indictment, which involved the December 2, 1993, transmission of the photograph depicting a ten-year-old girl in a sexually explicit act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Chapman's plea, the U.S. Probation Department prepared Chapman's presentence report (the \"PSR\").  In addition to the information set forth above, the PSR stated that Chapman told investigators that he had obtained about fifty pornographic images over the computer network, and had engaged in sexually graphic correspondence with hundreds of computer network subscribers over the preceding two months.  Chapman objected to these statements in the PSR, maintaining that he had simply told investigators that he had access to fifty pornographic images over the computer network and that he had seen hundreds of names listed on AOL and other bulletin boards of people interested in sexually graphic correspondence.  Chapman also claimed in response to the PSR that he had never \"downloaded\" the photographs sent to Dan, that in fact he had never viewed them himself, and that the December 29 photograph depicted neither him nor a minor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSR also indicated that Chapman had prior convictions in Massachusetts for rape and for lewd and lascivious behavior arising from acts involving young children.  In addition, in 1981, Chapman had admitted to facts warranting a finding of guilt on a charge of indecent exposure;  that charge was continued with supervision and eventually dismissed.  Furthermore, the PSR stated that there was credible evidence that Chapman had made a series of obscene phone calls in 1988 to the twelve-year-old daughter of one of his friends;  Chapman disputed this allegation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Chapman's sentencing hearing on September 27, 1994, the only legal issue in dispute was the application of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4), which, under the category of \"Specific Offense Characteristics,\" states:  \"If the defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor, increase by 5 levels.\"   The PSR recommended the application of the pattern-of-activity enhancement to Chapman because he had transmitted three sexually explicit photographs of minors on December 2 and a fourth on December 29.  The district court agreed and applied the enhancement to Chapman, stating that it based its decision on \"[t]he entire record, the prior record, the other conduct, the 1988 incident, the entire record that I have before me, with the exception of [the December 29 photo], which I accept [defense counsel's] argument on.\"   The court imposed a sentence of thirty-three months, the minimum under the applicable guideline range.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chapman argues that the district court erred in applying Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4) to him because the guideline does not permit consideration of past sexual abuse or exploitation that is unrelated to the offense of conviction, and because the transmission of child pornography by computer is not \"sexual abuse or exploitation\" within the meaning of the guideline.  Thus, Chapman challenges the district court's interpretation of the meaning and scope of the guideline, which we review de novo.  United States v.

The commentary to Sec. 2G2.2 explains that the quoted phrase \"means any combination of two or more separate instances of the sexual abuse or the sexual exploitation of a minor, whether involving the same or different victims.\"   U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.2, comment.  (n. 4).  \"Sexual abuse\" and \"sexual exploitation,\" however, are not defined in either the relevant sentencing guidelines or their corresponding statutory provisions.  The government does not argue that trafficking in child pornography, by itself, is sexual abuse;  the question for us to decide is whether it may be considered sexual exploitation of a minor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most nearly relevant dictionary definition of \"exploitation\" is \"an unjust or improper use of another person for one's own profit or advantage.\"   Webster's Third New International Dictionary (1986).  In a broad sense, anyone who chooses to look at child pornography has \"improperly used\" the child depicted in the materials and thus has exploited that child--a trafficker in such materials, whether recipient or sender, all the more so.  We do not think that Congress,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> or the Sentencing Commission, intended for the word \"exploitation\" in Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4) to carry this all-encompassing meaning.  We reach this conclusion based on the interaction of subsection (b)(4) with other guidelines provisions, and on the Sentencing Commission's use of \"exploitation\" in other contexts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first clue to the meaning of the phrase \"sexual exploitation\" is provided by the disparate titles of the guidelines punishing violations of 18 U.S.C. Secs. 2251-52.  See Berniger v. Meadow Green-Wildcat Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"568543\"><a href=\"/opinion/568543/randi-beth-berniger-v-meadow-green-wildcat-corp-dba-wildcat-mountain/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1991) (titles may aid in construing any ambiguities in a statute).  The title of U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.1, applicable to crimes related to the production of child pornography, is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>Sexually Exploiting a Minor by Production of Sexually Explicit Visual or Printed Material:  Custodian Permitting Minor to Engage in Sexually Explicit Conduct:  Advertisement for Minors to Engage in Production</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).  The title of Sec. 2G2.2 is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>Trafficking in Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor;  Receiving, Transporting, Shipping, or Advertising Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor;  Possessing Material Involving the Sexual Exploitation of a Minor with Intent to Traffic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).  The title of Sec. 2G2.1 clearly indicates that the acts to which that guideline applies are themselves sexual exploitation of a minor;  the title of Sec. 2G2.2 suggests that while the material \"involves\" sexual exploitation of a minor, trafficking in such material does not.  If subsection (b)(4) of Sec. 2G2.2 were meant to include the trafficking offenses punishable by that very same guideline, one would expect that the Sentencing Commission--either in subsection (b)(4) itself or in application note 4--would have used language that more obviously included those offenses.  For example, application note 4 could have defined \"pattern of activity\" as \"any combination of two or more acts involving the sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a minor, or the trafficking in, or transportation or receipt of, material involving such exploitation.\"   Cf. U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.4(b)(2) (increasing offense level of defendants convicted of possession of child pornography \"if the offense involved possessing ten or more books, magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes, or other items, containing a visual depiction involving the sexual exploitation of a minor\").  By limiting \"pattern of activity\" to \"instances of the sexual abuse or the sexual exploitation of a minor,\" in the context of a guideline that by its own terms differentiates itself from another guideline that does explicitly apply to the sexual exploitation of minors, the Sentencing Commission has provided at least a strong initial clue that it does not understand \"exploitation\" to include trafficking offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The relevant statutory provisions make a similar distinction.  The title of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2251, which applies to persons directly involved in the production or advertisement of child pornography, is \"Sexual exploitation of children,\" while 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252 is titled \"Certain activities relating to material involving the sexual exploitation of minors.\"   Thus, Congress apparently intended to draw a distinction between those directly engaged in sexually exploiting minors and those who were engaged in \"certain activities related to material involving\" such exploitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that if we are going to look to titles in interpreting the guideline, then we should look to the title of Chapter 110 of Title 18 of the U.S.Code, in which all of the relevant child pornography statutes are grouped--\"Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children\"--or to the heading of Part 2G2 of the Guidelines, under which both Sec. 2G2.1 and Sec. 2G2.2 are grouped--\"Sexual Exploitation of a Minor.\"   These broad headings, the government argues, suggest that the term \"sexual exploitation\" has a broader meaning than simply those activities described in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2251 or U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.1.  We agree that there are some activities not described in those provisions that may be considered sexual exploitation for purposes of Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4);  we do not agree, however, that any activity subsumed within Chapter 110, including trafficking, necessarily constitutes sexual exploitation of a minor.  For example, the statute prescribing record-keeping requirements for the producers of sexually explicit material, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2257, is intended to protect minors but does not require any involvement with minors for its violation.  Yet it is placed within Chapter 110 of Title 18, and its corresponding guideline, Sec. 2G2.5, is placed under the broader heading of \"Sexual Exploitation of a Minor.\"   By the government's reasoning, violations of Sec. 2257 would constitute \"sexual exploitation of a minor\" for purposes of Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4) even though the violator of that statute might never have had any involvement with children, directly or indirectly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the use of titles has its limits in statutory interpretation,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and we do not rely exclusively on titles to interpret the provision at issue here.  Indeed, were there no other indicators of the Commission's intent, we might be inclined to agree with the government.  But there are other indicators, and we find them to be dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Direct evidence that the Sentencing Commission differentiates between sexual exploitation of a minor and trafficking in materials depicting such exploitation is provided by Amendment 372 to the Guidelines.  That amendment inserted a new guideline, Sec. 2G2.4, to address offenses involving the receipt or possession of child pornography, as distinguished from the trafficking offenses covered by Sec. 2G2.2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The new guideline contained, and still contains, cross references to both Sec. 2G2.1 and Sec. 2G2.2.  See U.S.S.G. Sec. 2G2.4(c)(1)-(2).  The Commission explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p>Offenses involving receipt or transportation of [child pornography] for the purpose of trafficking are referenced to Sec. 2G2.2 on the basis of the underlying conduct (subsection (c)(2)).  Similarly, offenses in which the underlying conduct is more appropriately addressed as sexual exploitation of a minor are referenced to that guideline (subsection (c)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. App.  C., Amendment 372 (emphasis added).  \"That guideline\" referred to in the quoted passage's last sentence is Sec. 2G2.1;  the Commission could not have been much more clear in distinguishing \"trafficking\" offenses from those \"more appropriately addressed as sexual exploitation of a minor.\"   Yet, the government argues that we should now ascribe to the Commission an intention to include trafficking offenses within the meaning of sexual exploitation for purposes of Sec. 2G2.2(b)(4), even though the Commission has clearly differentiated the two on a previous occasion.  We are unable to find any clear evidence that the Commission in drafting subsection (b)(4) intended to abandon its prior differentiation, and we therefore will not ascribe to it any such motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Application note 5 to Sec. 2G2.2 delivers the defining answer to the government's argument.  It states:If the defendant sexually exploited or abused a minor at any time, whether or not such sexual abuse occurred during the course of the offense, an upward departure may be warranted.  In determining the extent of such a departure, the court should take into consideration the offense levels provided in Secs. 2A3.1, 2A3.2, and 2A3.4 most commensurate with the defendant's conduct, as well as whether the defendant has received an enhancement under subsection (b)(4) on account of such conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we were to adopt the government's argument that the computer transmission of child pornography is sexual exploitation, then the first sentence of this note would mean that a court may depart upward from the guideline sentencing range for the very same act of \"exploitation \"--i.e., the transmission of a photograph--that led to the conviction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The Commission might as well draft a sentencing guideline applicable to bank robberies, and then state in an application note that \"if the defendant robbed a bank at any time, an upward departure may be warranted.\"   This is not how the guidelines are meant to operate;  departures are permitted only if \"an aggravating or mitigating circumstance exists that was not adequately taken into consideration by the Sentencing Commission in formulating the guidelines and that should result in a sentence different from that described.\"  18 U.S.C. Sec. 3553(b).  Yet the application note says nothing about an aggravating circumstance;  if trafficking is sexual exploitation, then trafficking alone, without any aggravating circumstances, permits a judge to depart upward.  This makes no sense:  An offense specifically punishable under the guideline cannot at the same time be \"an aggravating ... circumstance ... not adequately taken into consideration\" by the Commission;  indeed, if the offense may also, by itself, warrant an upward departure, then the guideline serves no useful purpose.  Thus, we must conclude that \"sexually exploited,\" as used in application note 5 of Sec. 2G2.2 to warrant an upward departure, must mean something different than the substantive offenses punishable under that guideline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the interpretation of subsection (b)(4) that we adopt will render the pattern-of-activity enhancement virtually useless, and that therefore we should breathe life into it by assigning it some other meaning.  For example, a defendant convicted of a trafficking offense, but whose offense involved a pattern of production-related activity sufficient under our interpretation to warrant the enhancement under subsection (b)(4), would, in accordance with the cross reference of Sec. 2G2.2(c)(1), be sentenced under the guideline applicable to production offenses, Sec. 2G2.1, if his resulting offense level were greater than that under Sec. 2G2.2.  Section 2G2.1 carries a base offense level of 25, compared to a base offense level of just 15 under Sec. 2G2.2;  the only way a trafficker could ever receive a higher offense level under Sec. 2G2.2 than under Sec. 2G2.1 would be if his offense involved distribution (five-level increase;  Sec. 2G2.2(b)(2)) and the material involved portrayed sadistic or masochistic conduct (four-level increase;  Sec. 2G2.2(b)(3)), and he received the five-level pattern-of-activity enhancement (bringing his total offense level to 29).  It is unlikely, the government argues, that Congress intended the pattern-of-activity enhancement to have such limited applicability, and therefore we should broaden its applicability by construing \"sexual exploitation\" to include trafficking in child pornography.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But there may well be activities that constitute sexual exploitation, as used in subsection (b)(4), that neither implicate the cross reference to Sec. 2G2.1 nor clearly rise to the level of sexual abuse.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  And, in any event, while the limited applicability of subsection (b)(4) may be troubling, it would be more troubling to interpret the phrase \"sexual exploitation\" in a novel manner solely to give it wider applicability.  Moreover, the government's solution would result in a subsection that, on its face, enhances punishment for a pattern-of-activity of sexual abuse or exploitation, but that in practice primarily enhances punishment for traffickers.  This can hardly be what Congress, or the Commission, intended when they included the phrase \"sexual abuse or exploitation.\"   Had they intended such a result, they would have listed the trafficking-type offenses.  Both Congress and the Commission had opportunities to make clear that they intended trafficking offenses to be included in \"sexual exploitation.\"   Neither chose to do so.  Since both Congress and the Commission have distinguished trafficking from \"sexual exploitation\" previously, we will not now construe that phrase otherwise merely to give subsection (b)(4) wider applicability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our interpretation of subsection (b)(4) is at variance with the only previous reported decision interpreting the provision.  In United States v. Surratt, a district court suggested in dictum that the pattern of activity enhancement might apply to \"a pattern of ordering child pornography through the mail.\"  <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1456229\"><a href=\"/opinion/1456229/united-states-v-surratt/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1317</span></a></span>, 1320 (N.D.Ohio 1994).  We think this dictum is simply wrong, for all the reasons discussed above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having decided that sexual exploitation, as used in subsection (b)(4), does not include the computer transmission of child pornography, we pause to consider whether the record would allow us to conclude that the district court applied the pattern-of-activity enhancement based on at least two instances of offense-related activity other than the receipt or transmission of child pornography.  Were we able to reach this conclusion, it would not be necessary to consider whether the activity contemplated by subsection (b)(4) must in fact be offense-related, for the district court's consideration of other sexual abuse or exploitation would be harmless.  A careful review of the record, however, provides no basis for such a conclusion.  While Chapman, in the course of transmitting photographs to Dan, boasted of sexually abusing children and discussed how he and Dan could commit unspeakable atrocities against a young girl, the government found no evidence that Chapman actually committed or planned to commit such acts.  Similarly, although Chapman boasted that the December 29 photograph depicted him engaging in anal intercourse with a young girl, the district court found that that photograph did not even depict a minor, and the government offered no other evidence that Chapman had produced any child pornography.  Thus, while there was considerable evidence that Chapman had transmitted child pornography on numerous occasions, and had engaged in detailed conversations about sexually abusing, and murdering, young children, the record contains insufficient evidence to conclude, even on a preponderance standard, that Chapman actually sexually abused or exploited minors in conjunction with his trafficking offense (or even during the time he was an AOL subscriber).  Consequently, we have no choice but to consider whether the district court was correct in considering Chapman's past activity in applying subsection (b)(4).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  While we disagree with the Surratt court's dictum, we fully endorse its holding that subsection (b)(4) is inapplicable to past sexual abuse or exploitation unrelated to the offense of conviction.  See Surratt, 867 F.Supp. at 1320.   In Surratt, the defendant was convicted on one count of receiving child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2252(a)(2);  during a search of the defendant's home, the government discovered other videotapes depicting the defendant sexually abusing his own daughter.  Id.  Based on this past sexual abuse, the government sought a pattern of activity enhancement under subsection (b)(4).  The Surratt court declined to apply the enhancement, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>The heading of subsection (b) is \"Specific Offense Characteristics.\"   In other words, enhancements included in subsection (b) are available when, as part of the offense of conviction, the defendant undertakes the actions listed therein.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that subsection (b)(4) is different from subsections (b)(1), (b)(2) or (b)(3) because it does not begin with the language \"If the offense involved....\"  This argument is unavailing.  The government appears to be suggesting that if the defendant ever engaged in such a pattern of behavior, whether as part of the charged offense or at a completely different time or place, subsection (b)(4) should apply.  This Court cannot agree.  If the Sentencing Commission had not intended for the language of subsection (b)(4) to be applied only to the specific offense of conviction, that language would not be included in subsection (b), entitled \"Specific Offense Characteristics.\"   The government has pointed to no persuasive authority to convince the Court that \"specific offense characteristic\" means anything other than characteristics specific to the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with this reasoning.  If the Commission intended for subsection (b)(4) to apply to any previous sexual abuse or exploitation, while at the same time placing the provision under \"Specific Offense Characteristics,\" we would expect that it would have taken efforts to resolve this glaring contradiction.  It clearly knew how to do so:  Application Note 5 states in no uncertain terms that an upward departure is warranted for any instance of sexual exploitation or abuse \"whether or not such sexual abuse occurred during the course of the offense.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Cf. U.S.S.G. Sec. 2L1.2(1)-(2) (stating clearly that defendant's base offense level must be increased if defendant \"previously\" was deported after conviction for felony or aggravated felony).  The absence of similar language in subsection (b)(4), combined with the fact that the subsection is classified under the rubric of \"Specific Offense Characteristics,\" compels the conclusion that the application of the subsection does require that the pattern of activity relate to the offense of conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all the foregoing reasons, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> All references to the Sentencing Guidelines, unless otherwise noted, are to the 1993 Guidelines Manual</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The photograph showed the man's lower torso but not his face</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The district court arrived at Chapman's sentence in the following manner:  The Base Offense Level for Chapman's offense was 15.

The court subtracted three levels for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to Sec. 3E1.1(b), bringing Chapman's adjusted offense level to 19.  Chapman's criminal history placed him in category II, making his applicable guideline sentencing range thirty-three to forty-one months</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Sentencing Commission added subsection (b)(4) and application note 4 to Sec. 2G2.2 in 1991 pursuant to a congressional mandate.  See U.S.S.G. App.  C., Amendment 435;  Treasury, Postal Service and General Government Appropriations Act of 1992, Pub.L. No. 102-141, Sec. 632.  The legislative history sheds little, if any, light on what Congress intended the pattern-of-activity enhancement to mean.  Senators Helms and Thurmond, the amendment's sponsors, focused on the need for higher base offense levels for purveyors and possessors of child pornography (the base offense levels for possessors and recipients of child pornography were, respectively, 10 and 13 at the time), and on the link between child pornography and sexual abuse.  See 137 Cong.Rec. S10322-33 (daily ed. July 18, 1991) (statements of Senators Helms and Thurmond).  In relevant part, section 632 of the Act ordered the Sentencing Commission to amend Sec. 2G2.2 \"to provide a base offense level of not less than 15 and to provide at least a 5 level increase for offenders who have engaged in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of a minor.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We recognize, for instance, that neither the title of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 12251A (\"Selling or buying of children\") nor the title of Guidelines Sec. 2G2.3 (\"Selling or Buying of Children for Use in the Production of Pornography\") expressly states that the acts addressed by those provisions constitute the sexual exploitation of a minor.  We would be loath to say, however, that the buying or selling of children for sexual purposes--whether or not for use in the production of child pornography--could not be considered part of a pattern of activity of sexual exploitation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Receipt offenses are now covered by Sec. 2G2.2, and Sec. 2G2.4 applies only to possession offenses</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Commission inserted the words \"exploited or\" in the first sentence of application note 5 in 1991, at the same time it added subsection (b)(4) to the guideline.

It did not amend the second clause of that sentence (\"whether or not such sexual abuse ... \"), nor did it insert in the following sentence a reference to the guideline applicable to sexual exploitation.  One might argue that the Commission omitted any such reference intentionally, intending for sexual exploitation to include more crimes than those listed in Sec. 2G2.1.  We do not believe, however, that the Commission intended to open the door for departures based on any activity that might conceivably be labeled sexual exploitation;  it had something more specific in mind.  Our best estimate of what \"something more specific\" encompasses is guided by the Commission's past usage of the term</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> To offer but a single example, imagine a recipient or sender of child pornography who, in the course of his activities, associates with teenagers who engage in \"sexually explicit conduct\" as defined at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256(2)(E) (\"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person\"), but who neither has physical contact with them nor photographs them.  This offender should not be sentenced under Sec. 2G2.1;  nevertheless, he has clearly made \"improper use\" of the minors for his own sexual gratification:  he has exploited them</p>\n        <p>The enhancement also has obvious applicability in cases involving sexual abuse.  Section 2G2.2 contains no cross-reference for a defendant whose trafficking offense also involved sexual abuse.  While application note 5 permits a sentencing judge to depart upward in such circumstances, and directs his or her attention to the guidelines applicable to sexual abuse in determining the appropriate extent of any departure, subsection (b)(4) substantially increases the sentence of a defendant who has engaged in two instances of sexual abuse without requiring an exercise of discretion on the part of the judge.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The government does not strongly argue that past activity should be considered under subsection (b)(4);  it maintains instead that the district court's consideration of Chapman's previous activity was \"harmless error if error at all,\" in light of Chapman's multiple computer transmissions of child pornography.  However, because we have ruled that the transmissions themselves do not constitute instances of sexual exploitation and that the record provides no other basis on which the district court could have applied the pattern-of-activity enhancement for offense-related conduct, we must consider whether it was proper to look to previous, non-offense-related conduct</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The district court could have invoked this application note and departed upward based on Chapman's previous sexual abuse of minors</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
