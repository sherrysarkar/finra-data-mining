Pro  se appellant Fred  Davis appeals\r                                \r\n\nfrom  the   district  court's  dismissal  of   his  claim  of\r\n\ndiscrimination  on the  basis of  age and  religion and  from\r\n\nvarious interlocutory rulings.  We view the dismissal as  one\r\n\nfor lack of prosecution  after Davis unjustifiably refused to\r\n\nbe deposed over a period of nearly four months.  We affirm.\r\n\n          We note initially that Davis is unlikely to be able\r\n\nto refile  his Title  VII claim of  religious discrimination,\r\n\nsince the 90-day  period after  receipt of his  right to  sue\r\n\nletter  has expired.  See  Wilson v. Grumman  Ohio Corp., 815\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 26, 27-28 (8th  Cir. 1987) (Title VII plaintiff  may not\r\n\nrefile an action, which was dismissed without prejudice after\r\n\nbeing timely  filed, where the refiling did  not occur within\r\n\n90 days  after receipt of the  right to sue letter).   Hence,\r\n\ndismissal  of that  claim operated  with prejudice  to Davis.\r                                                              \r\n\nAccordingly,  we  evaluate  the  dismissal  under   case  law\r\n\nconsidering dismissals with prejudice.\r\n\n          A district court may  dismiss a case with prejudice\r\n\nfor lack of  prosecution where the  plaintiff has engaged  in\r\n\n\"extreme misconduct.\"     See Figueroa v.  Alegria, 896  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n645, 647 (1st Cir. 1990).  Extreme misconduct may be shown by\r\n\n\"extremely   protracted   inaction   (measured   in   years),\r\n\ndisobedience   of  court   orders,  ignorance   of  warnings,\r\n\ncontumacious  conduct  .  .   .  or  some  other  aggravating\r\n\ncircumstance  such  as prejudice  to  the defendant,  glaring\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nweaknesses  in  the   plaintiff's  case,  and  the   wasteful\r\n\nexpenditure of the district court's time.\"  Id.\r                                                           \r\n\n          The district court did  not abuse its discretion in\r\n\ndismissing this  case.  Davis was  arguably \"contumacious\" in\r\n\nunjustifiably refusing to be  deposed.  Although he submitted\r\n\nhis own affidavit and later a  note by a physician (but not a\r\n\nphysician's affidavit,  as directed by the  court) in support\r\n\nof his alleged illness, both  documents spoke of his  illness\r\n\nin  conclusory  terms.   Neither  described  or documented  a\r\n\nspecific medical condition or history of treatment that would\r\n\nshow  that Davis  was  too  ill to  be  deposed.   Under  the\r\n\ncircumstances, the court could reasonably have concluded that\r\n\nDavis's refusal to be deposed was willful.\r\n\n          There were additional aggravating  circumstances as\r\n\nwell.   First, besides refusing to  be deposed, Davis impeded\r\n\nprogress in  his case  in other ways.   He failed  to respond\r\n\nvoluntarily and  completely  to defendants'  other  discovery\r\n\nrequests.   In every instance, defendants had to apply to the\r\n\ncourt for an order  before Davis responded, and  his ultimate\r\n\nresponses were incomplete or  inadequate.  Second, there were\r\n\n\"glaring weaknesses\" in his claim  of discrimination.  In his\r\n\nanswers to interrogatories, he  implied, but did not directly\r\n\nstate, that defendant Joseph Buckley had  made discriminatory\r\n\ncomments  when  he  refused  to  grieve  Davis's   discharge.\r\n\nDavis's    simultaneous    characterization   of    Buckley's\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nexplanation for not grieving his discharge  -- that Davis had\r\n\nnot paid  his union dues --  as a \"pretext\"  suggests that no\r\n\nsuch  discriminatory comments  were  made.   Likewise,  while\r\n\nDavis's August 1994 letter to union president John Sweeney on\r\n\nthe incident in question referred to Buckley's assertion that\r\n\nDavis had not  paid his union  dues, it  did not mention  any\r\n\ndiscriminatory comments  by Buckley.  Finally,  given Davis's\r\n\ninadequate  responses to  defendants' written  discovery, his\r\n\nunexcused   refusal  to   be   deposed  arguably   prejudiced\r\n\ndefendants'  ability to  defend this  action, which  had been\r\n\npending for over a year when it was dismissed.\r\n\n          Because the court properly dismissed the action for\r\n\nlack of prosecution, we  need not consider the merits  of the\r\n\ninterlocutory  orders  challenged  on  appeal.   See  Ash  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCvetkov, 739 F.2d 493, 495 (9th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 470\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 1007 (1985) (interlocutory rulings do not merge into the\r\n\nfinal judgment in cases dismissed for lack of prosecution and\r\n\nso are not reviewable  on appeal); accord DuBose v.
