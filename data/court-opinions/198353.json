Pettingell, with whom Davis, White &amp; Pettingell,\r\nLLC, Anthony R. Zelle and Zelle &amp; Larson were on brief for St. Paul\r\nMercury Insurance Co.\r\nJoseph M. Orlando, with whom David S. Smith, Vita A. Palazzoloand Orlando and Associates, were on brief for Ferrara &amp; DiMercurio,\r\nInc.\r\n\nMarch 4, 1999\r\n\n                               CAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  The commercial\r\nfishing vessel F/V TWO FRIENDS was destroyed by fire on July 3,\r\n1993, while berthed in Gloucester, Massachusetts.  Ferrara &amp;\r\nDiMercurio, Inc. (\"F&amp;D\"), the owner of the vessel, sought to\r\nrecover insurance  under a Hull policy issued by St. Paul Mercury\r\nInsurance Company (\"St. Paul\").  St. Paul refused to pay, on the\r\nalternative grounds that either a third party had burned the\r\nvessel, an event that, in St. Paul's view, was expressly excluded\r\nfrom policy coverage, or else F&amp;D had committed fraud by\r\nintentionally burning its own vessel.  F&amp;D brought this action in\r\nthe district court, under the diversity jurisdiction, claiming that\r\nSt. Paul's refusal to pay was a breach of the insurance contract\r\nand constituted \"bad faith\" in violation of Massachusetts consumer\r\nprotection laws (Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A).  Prior to trial, the\r\ndistrict court ruled that the Hull policy covered losses caused by\r\nfires intentionally set by third parties.  After St. Paul presented\r\nits arson-by-the-insured defense at trial, the district court\r\ngranted judgment as a matter of law for F&amp;D.  The Chapter 93A claim\r\nwas subsequently dismissed on summary judgment.  \r\nOn appeal, St. Paul contends that the district court\r\nerred in ruling that losses caused by fires intentionally set by\r\nthird parties are covered under the Hull policy.  St. Paul also\r\nappeals from the district court's grant of F&amp;D's motion for\r\njudgment as a matter of law.  F&amp;D cross-appeals from the district\r\ncourt's grant of St. Paul's motion for summary judgment on F&amp;D's \r\nChapter 93A claim.  For the reasons that follow, we reverse the\r\ndistrict court's ruling that the Hull policy covers losses caused\r\nby third-party arson and reverse the directed verdict granted in\r\nfavor of F&amp;D.  We affirm the dismissal of the Chapter 93A claim.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nF&amp;D was a closely-held, family corporation engaged in the\r\ncommercial fishing trade.  The corporation had four officers: \r\nLeonardo Ferrara, Sr., Vito Ferrara, Ambrose Ferrara, and Francesco\r\nDiMercurio.  Six individuals, all family members, owned shares in\r\nthe company:  Leonardo Ferrara, Sr., Vito Ferrara, Ambrose Ferrara,\r\nFrancesco DiMercurio, Vincenza Ferrara, and Enza DiMercurio.     \r\nIn 1987, F&amp;D purchased the commercial fishing vessel F/V\r\nTWO FRIENDS for $375,000 with the proceeds of a loan from the\r\nGloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company.  As a condition of the loan,\r\nmembers of the Ferrara family agreed to act as personal guarantors\r\nof F&amp;D's note.  In addition, Vincenza Ferrara and Francesco\r\nDiMercurio pledged their homes as additional security.  The TWO\r\nFRIENDS was the sole physical asset owned by F&amp;D.  It was  insured\r\nfor $350,000 under a Marine Hull and Machinery policy issued to F&amp;D\r\nin 1992 by St. Paul.  The Hull policy that was issued by St. Paul\r\nwas an American Institute AHAB Form policy, revised as of July 1,\r\n1962.  The TWO FRIENDS was also insured for $350,000 under a War\r\nRisk policy issued to F&amp;D by Underwriters at Lloyd's, London.\r\nAt trial, James Carey, St. Paul's accounting and\r\nfinancial expert, testified that F&amp;D had operated at a loss from\r\nthe moment of its formation.  Carey testified that F&amp;D had\r\nconsiderable difficulty in making timely loan payments to\r\nGloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company.  Because F&amp;D was habitually late\r\nin making its payments, the bank made demand in July, 1991, for\r\npayment in full of the outstanding loan, an amount in excess of\r\n$290,000.  In November 1991, the bank made demand upon the personal\r\nguarantors of F&amp;D's note for payment in full of the outstanding\r\nloan.  Also in November 1991, the bank filed a lawsuit to foreclose\r\non the residence of Vincenza Ferrara.  After a period of\r\nnegotiation, the bank, F&amp;D, and the personal guarantors reached an\r\nagreement in January 1992, whereby the bank would forebear from\r\nproceeding to judgment in the foreclosure action so long as $15,000\r\nwas paid to the bank and monthly payments were kept current\r\nthereafter.  \r\nAfter the January 1992 agreement, Carey testified that\r\nF&amp;D continued to have difficulty making timely payments to the\r\nbank.  At a meeting in April 1993, F&amp;D and representatives of\r\nGloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company agreed that F&amp;D would attempt to\r\nsell the TWO FRIENDS for $225,000.  On April 15, 1993, F&amp;D entered\r\ninto an exclusive brokerage agreement with Ahern Marine Agency,\r\nInc. in an effort to sell the TWO FRIENDS.    \r\nOn July 2, 1993, the TWO FRIENDS returned to Gloucester\r\nfrom a five-day fishing trip with Leo Ferrara, Jr. and three crew\r\nmembers aboard.  Leo Ferrara, Jr., the ship's engineer, testified\r\nthat he left the TWO FRIENDS at approximately 4:30 p.m., and that\r\nhe was the last crew member to leave the vessel.  He further\r\ntestified that prior to leaving the vessel, he had locked all of\r\nthe doors both upstairs and downstairs.  He testified that the only\r\nway to gain access to the TWO FRIENDS once these doors were locked\r\nwas through the door on the crew quarters level, which he had\r\nsecured with a padlock.  \r\nOn July 3, 1993, at approximately 2:30 a.m., the TWO\r\nFRIENDS caught fire while tied to her berth at the Frontiero\r\nBrothers, Inc. wharf.  When the Gloucester Fire Department arrived, \r\nfirefighters discovered that the only door through which they could\r\ngain entry to the TWO FRIENDS was located on the crew quarters\r\nlevel and was padlocked.  The firefighters cut the padlock in order\r\nto enter.  The Gloucester Fire Department's preliminary report,\r\nwhich was prepared on July 4, 1993, indicated that the cause of the\r\nfire was electrical in nature, but the origin uncertain.   \r\nLeo Ferrara, Jr. and Vito Ferrara both testified that at\r\nthe time of the fire, there were only four keys to the padlock used\r\nto secure the door on the crew quarters level.  One of the keys was\r\nin the possession of Leonardo Ferrara, Sr., the president of F&amp;D,\r\none was in the possession of his son, Vito Ferrara, the vice-\r\npresident of the corporation, one was in the possession of Leo\r\nFerrara, Jr., and the final key was hanging, along with the keys to\r\nother vessels, inside a warehouse on the Frontiero Brothers, Inc.\r\nwharf.  Pasquale Frontiero, the owner of the wharf, testified that\r\non the night of the fire he had locked the warehouse prior to going\r\nhome for the evening.  He testified that a few days after the fire,\r\nhe noticed that the key to the TWO FRIENDS was still hanging in its\r\nusual location inside the warehouse.\r\nAfter receiving notification of the fire aboard the TWO\r\nFRIENDS, St. Paul retained Fred O'Donnell, a fire scene analyst,\r\nand John Malcolm, a forensic electrical fire consultant, to\r\ninvestigate the cause and origin of the fire.  O'Donnell and\r\nMalcolm first visited the fire scene on July 8, 1993.  They were\r\naccompanied by David DuBois, a marine surveyor who had also been\r\nretained by St. Paul.  On this initial visit, Malcolm, DuBois, and\r\nO'Donnell conducted a visual inspection of the TWO FRIENDS and\r\nO'Donnell took samples from the crew quarters and galley areas to\r\ndetermine whether an accelerant was present.    \r\nMalcolm and O'Donnell returned to the vessel on August 3,\r\n1993, to obtain the electrical panels, ostensibly for inspection\r\nand possible subrogation claims.  At the request of counsel for St.\r\nPaul, but without obtaining authorization from F&amp;D, O'Donnell and\r\nMalcolm removed the electrical panels from the TWO FRIENDS.  The\r\npanels were placed in an evidence storage locker at Malcolm's\r\nlaboratory and were provided to counsel for F&amp;D upon his request. \r\nO'Donnell testified that based upon his examination of\r\nburn patterns, he was able to identify points of origin for at\r\nleast three, and possibly four, separate fires aboard the TWO\r\nFRIENDS.  He testified that one point of origin was located\r\nadjacent to a bunk in the port side crew quarters bunkroom, and\r\nanother point of origin was located one deck below the crew\r\nquarters in the engine room at an electrical panel on the forward\r\nstarboard side bulkhead.  O'Donnell testified that a third point of\r\norigin was also located in the engine room, on the port side next\r\nto the main hydraulic tank.  Finally, O'Donnell testified that\r\nthere was an area of \"heavy burn\" in the galley area.  \r\nO'Donnell testified that two of the three samples he had\r\ntaken from the crew's quarters contained traces of diesel fuel, but\r\nthat none of the samples taken from the galley area contained\r\nevidence of an accelerant.  He further testified that, in his\r\nopinion, the fire on the port side of the engine room was set by\r\nsomeone placing a container filled with accelerant in the forward\r\nport corner of the engine room next to the hydraulic tank hoses.  \r\nMalcolm investigated the vessel's electrical system to\r\ndetermine whether it played any part in the fire.  He testified\r\nthat based upon his interview of Leo Ferrara, Jr. on July 8, 1993,\r\nit did not appear that the TWO FRIENDS had experienced any\r\nelectrical difficulties on the July 2, 1993 fishing trip.  Malcolm\r\ntestified that he found no evidence that the electrical system had\r\nplayed any role in the fires in the bunkroom or in the fire that\r\noriginated in the engine room on the port side.  He testified,\r\nhowever, that he did find evidence of the escape of electricity, \r\nor \"arcing,\" in the electrical panel on the forward starboard side\r\nbulkhead in the engine room.  Malcolm testified that, based upon\r\nhis examination of the vessel's electrical system, it was his\r\nopinion that the fire in the electrical panel in the engine room\r\nwas the first fire to ignite on July 3, 1993.  Malcolm also\r\nconcluded in his written report, drafted on July 22, 1993, and\r\ntestified at trial that the burn patterns in the area of the\r\nelectrical panel were consistent with an accidental electrical\r\nfire.  He specifically noted in his report and testified that it\r\nwas possible for persons to intentionally set up the burning of an\r\nelectrical panel to make the fire appear accidental, but that he\r\nhad discovered no electrical evidence that this had occurred.\r\nO'Donnell and Malcolm both testified that there was no \r\nevidence of \"communication,\" or connection, between either of the\r\ntwo fires in the engine room and the fires in the crew quarters or\r\nbetween the two fires in the engine room.  Based upon the arcing in\r\nthe engine room electrical panel and the absence of arcing\r\nelsewhere in the ship's electrical system, Malcolm concluded that\r\nthe fire in the crew quarters could not have ignited the fire in\r\nthe electrical panel in the engine room.  Malcolm and O'Donnell\r\nboth concluded that the fire at the electrical panel was not the\r\nsource of the fire in the crew quarters, as there was no evidence\r\nthat the electrical panel fire had spread upward from the panel. \r\nBased upon his examination of the burn patterns on the engine room\r\nfloor boards, O'Donnell concluded that the fire in the electrical\r\npanel on the starboard side of the engine room did not cause the\r\nfire on the port side of the engine room next to the hydraulic\r\ntank.  Given the absence of evidence of communication among the\r\nvarious fires originating at different locations on the vessel, as\r\nwell as the evidence that an accelerant was present in the crew\r\nquarters and on the port side of the engine room, O'Donnell\r\ntestified that, in his opinion, the fires aboard the TWO FRIENDS\r\nhad been deliberately set by someone.\r\nCarey, the accounting expert, testified that at the time\r\nof the fire, F&amp;D owed a total of $426,000 to various creditors.  He\r\nfurther testified that to meet its financial obligations at the\r\ntime of the fire, F&amp;D would have had to generate revenues from its\r\nfishing operation of approximately $380,000 per year.  Carey\r\ntestified that F&amp;D had never been that profitable in all its years\r\nof operation.  Carey also testified that had the July 3, 1993 fire\r\naboard the TWO FRIENDS resulted in a total loss of the vessel, and\r\nhad St. Paul paid the full proceeds of the Hull policy, F&amp;D would\r\nhave gained $350,000 to be applied to its debts.  Carey stated that\r\nas a loss payee under the policy, the Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust\r\nCompany would have had its note paid in full, and that this payment\r\nwould have extinguished the personal liability of the guarantors of\r\nthe note and avoided the loss of the personal guarantors' homes. \r\nBy contrast, Carey testified that had the vessel been sold for\r\n$225,000, the bank loans would not have been paid in full, the\r\npersonal liability of the guarantors would not have been\r\nextinguished, and the homes of the personal guarantors would have\r\nremained in jeopardy.\r\nBefore trial, St. Paul requested a ruling of law that \r\nlosses caused by arson committed by a party other than the insured\r\nwere not covered under the Hull policy.  The \"Perils\" clause of the\r\nHull policy under which the TWO FRIENDS was insured listed \"Fire\"\r\nas a covered peril.  St. Paul argued, however, that only fires\r\nthat are \"fortuitous\" and \"of the Sea\" are covered under the Perils\r\nclause, and that the fire in this case met neither requirement. \r\nSt. Paul argued, in the alternative, that the Strikes, Riots, and\r\nCivil Commotions(\"SR&amp;CC\") clause excluded arson by third parties\r\nfrom coverage under the Hull policy.  The SR&amp;CC clause stated: \r\n\"Warranted free of loss, damage or expense in consequence of\r\nstrikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, civil\r\ncommotion, riots, martial law, military or usurped power or\r\nmalicious acts.\"  (emphasis supplied).  The district court ruled\r\nthat all fires, with the exception of those intentionally set by\r\nthe insured, were insured under the Perils clause.  The court\r\nfurther ruled that although arson by a third party was a \"malicious\r\nact,\" the SR&amp;CC clause did not exclude from coverage losses caused\r\nby fires intentionally set by third parties unless the arson was\r\nsomehow \"connected with\" a strike, lockout, political or labor\r\ndisturbance, riot, or some other event set forth in the SR&amp;CC\r\nclause.  As the arson alleged by St. Paul did not fit within any of\r\nthese categories, the district court ruled that the Hull policy\r\nprovided coverage for losses caused as a result of the burning of\r\nthe TWO FRIENDS by a third party.\r\nDenied the opportunity to defend on the further ground\r\nthat the vessel had been intentionally burned by unknown third\r\nparties, St. Paul concentrated at trial on the defense of arson-by-\r\nthe-insured.  In order to prevail on this defense, Massachusetts\r\nlaw required that St. Paul prove, by a preponderance of the\r\nevidence, that (1) the fire was incendiary in nature; (2) F&amp;D had\r\na motive to set the fire; and (3) F&amp;D or its agents had an\r\nopportunity to set the fire.  See infra.  St. Paul presented the\r\nevidence recounted above, including its experts' opinions that\r\nmultiple fires were deliberately set aboard the TWO FRIENDS, the\r\nevidence concerning the financial difficulties encountered by F&amp;D\r\nprior to the fire, and the limited availability of keys to the \r\nlocked vessel.  \r\nAfter St. Paul presented its arson defense, F&amp;D moved\r\nfor judgment as a matter of law.  The district court denied the\r\nmotion and ruled that whether St. Paul had proved its arson defense\r\nwas \"a question for the jury.\"  However, shortly after F&amp;D had\r\nbegun to put on its rebuttal case, the district court reconsidered\r\nits prior ruling and directed a verdict in favor of F&amp;D.  While the\r\ncourt considered it \"a very close question,\" it concluded that the\r\ncircumstantial evidence presented by St. Paul was not sufficient to\r\nallow a jury to return a verdict in its favor.  \r\nThereafter, the court allowed the parties to undertake\r\nadditional discovery on F&amp;D's claim that St. Paul's refusal to\r\nsettle under the Hull policy constituted an unfair or deceptive\r\nbusiness practice under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.  During this\r\nadditional discovery period, St. Paul produced, for the first time, \r\na report that had been prepared by its marine surveyor, David\r\nDuBois, on July 9, 1993, in which DuBois concurred with the\r\npreliminary conclusion of the Gloucester Fire Department that the\r\nfire on July 3, 1993, was electrical in nature.  The parties filed\r\ncross-motions for summary judgment on F&amp;D's Chapter 93A claim.  The\r\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of St. Paul. \r\n                     II.  ANALYSIS\r\nThe parties have filed cross-appeals challenging the\r\nrulings of the district court.  For the reasons that follow, we\r\nconclude that the district court erred in ruling that losses caused\r\nby fires intentionally set by third parties were not excluded by\r\nthe SR&amp;CC clause from coverage under the Hull policy.  We reverse\r\nthe directed verdict granted in favor of F&amp;D on the breach of\r\ncontract claim, but affirm the district court's grant of summary\r\njudgment in favor of St. Paul on the Chapter 93A claim.\r\nA.  Arson By Third Parties\r\nWe review de novo the district court's interpretation of\r\nthe St. Paul Hull insurance policy.  See St. Paul Fire and Marine\r\nIns. Co. v. Warwick Dyeing Corp., 26 F.3d 1195, 1199 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  We are guided by several familiar rules of construction. \r\nIn examining the language of the policy, we consider \"what an\r\nobjectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy\r\nlanguage, would expect to be covered.\"  Trustees of Tufts Univ. v.\r\nCommercial Union Ins. Co., 415 Mass. 844, 849 (1993) (quoting Hazen\r\nPaper Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 407 Mass. 689,\r\n700 (1990)).  Absent ambiguity, we give policy language its plain\r\nand ordinary meaning.  See Cody v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co.,\r\n387 Mass. 142, 146 (1982).  Any ambiguity is resolved against the\r\ninsurer, who drafted the policy, and in favor of the insured. \r\nThus, \"if there are two rational interpretations of policy\r\nlanguage, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is\r\nmore favorable to it.\"  Hazen, 407 Mass. at 700.  The insured bears\r\nthe burden of proving that a claim falls within the grant of\r\ncoverage, which, once established, shifts the burden to the insurer\r\nto show the applicability of any exclusion.  Camp Dresser &amp; McKee,\r\nInc. v. Home Ins. Co., 30 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 321 (1991).\r\nSt. Paul asserts that the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS, \r\nif deliberately set by a third party, was not covered under the\r\nPerils clause of the Hull policy because it was not \"of the seas\"\r\nor \"fortuitous.\"  See G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, The Law of Admiralty,\r\n2-9, p. 72 (2d ed. 1975) (perils \"of the sea\" are \"fortuitous\r\nlosses occurring through extraordinary action of the elements at\r\nsea, or any accident or mishap in navigation\").  St. Paul misreads\r\nthe Perils clause.  See n. 6, supra.  \"Fire\" is specified as a\r\ncovered peril in itself, separate and apart from the perils \"of the\r\nsea.\"  See Rosa v. Insurance Co. of the State of Pennsylvania, 421\r\nF.2d 390, 392 (9th Cir. 1970) (interpreting nearly identical perils\r\nclause to provide coverage for electrical fire).  St. Paul's \r\ninterpretation of the Perils clause would result in a denial of\r\ncoverage even if the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS were found to be\r\nentirely accidental in nature, since the fire would not have\r\nresulted from the elements at sea or navigational accident, and,\r\nthus, would not be \"of the seas.\"  That is not a rational\r\nconstruction of the Perils clause.  Indeed, St. Paul consistently\r\ndisavowed such an interpretation below, contending instead that\r\ncoverage was not available under the Hull policy because the loss\r\nhad been caused by the intentional burning of the vessel. \r\nSt. Paul's focus on the Perils clause is misplaced, as \r\nF&amp;D carried its burden of proving that accidental fires fall within\r\nthe grant of coverage under the Perils clause.  The burden shifted\r\nto St. Paul to demonstrate that a fire set deliberately by a third\r\nparty was, as the Perils clause states, \"excluded by provisions\r\nelsewhere in the Policy or by endorsement.\"  St. Paul asserts that\r\nthe SR&amp;CC clause, which excludes from coverage \"loss, damage or\r\nexpense in consequence of strikes, lockouts, political or labor\r\ndisturbances, civil commotion, riots, martial law, military or\r\nusurped power or malicious acts,\" excludes losses caused by third-\r\nparty arson.  The district court, however, construed the SR&amp;CC\r\nclause narrowly as excluding only losses caused by malicious acts\r\nthat are performed within the context of \"strikes, lockouts,\r\npolitical or labor disturbances, civil commotion, riots, martial\r\nlaw, military or usurped power.\"  \r\nF&amp;D concedes that arson by a third party constitutes a\r\n\"malicious act.\"  F&amp;D urges us, however, to affirm the district\r\ncourt's constricted reading of the SR&amp;CC clause.  Like the district\r\ncourt, we have found little guidance in the case law as to the\r\nproper construction of the language at issue.  The parties rely\r\nprimarily upon the decision of the district court in O'Donnell-Usen\r\nFisheries v. Bathurst, 664 F. Supp. 37 (D. Mass. 1987).  In\r\nBathurst, the F/V Ann C. Spencer was destroyed by fire.  A party\r\nunrelated to the insured was charged with arson of the vessel, but\r\nlater acquitted.  The insurer argued that arson by a third party\r\nwas not covered by the insurance policy.  The district court\r\nexamined in some detail the interplay between marine Hull policies,\r\nsuch as the one at issue here, and War Risk policies.  The latter,\r\nas the court pointed out, provide coverage for those risks\r\nprecluded from coverage under Hull clauses.  In Bathurst, the\r\ninsured, unlike F&amp;D, did not have a Hull policy.  Nevertheless, the\r\ndistrict court read the applicable War Risk policy to provide\r\ncoverage for only those risks that a Hull policy would have covered\r\nbut for the preclusion from coverage under its War, Strikes and\r\nRelated Exclusions (\"WSRE\") clause.  The court utilized the WSRE\r\nclause from the 1970 version of the American Institute Hull Clauses\r\n(\"AIHC\") form, which excluded from coverage any losses caused by,\r\ninter alia, \"malicious acts or vandalism.\"  The insured conceded\r\nthat arson was a \"malicious act or vandalism.\"  Thus, the court\r\nconcluded that \"when malicious acts or vandalism occur in the form\r\nof arson the loss is precluded from coverage by the [WRSE clause].\" \r\nId. at 41.  Since the WRSE clause of the Hull policy excluded\r\ncoverage for losses caused by arson perpetrated by a third party,\r\nthe court held that the War Risk policy provided coverage for such\r\nlosses.  See id. at 42.  \r\nSt. Paul argues that Bathurst supports its claim that\r\narson by a third party is excluded under the SR&amp;CC clause, while\r\nF&amp;D asserts that Bathurst is distinguishable, as the court was\r\ninterpreting a different insurance form than was used to insure the\r\nTWO FRIENDS.  The district court agreed with F&amp;D and distinguished\r\nBathurst on the ground that the SR&amp;CC clause in the St. Paul policy\r\nwas \"narrower\" than the WRSE clause construed by the court in\r\nBathurst.  \r\nWe see no important distinction, however, between the\r\nlanguage used in the 1962 AHAB Form used by St. Paul and the 1970\r\nAIHC Form construed by the district court in Bathurst.  The\r\nlanguage used in the two policy forms is nearly identical.  Both\r\nclauses exclude coverage for losses caused by, inter alia,\r\n\"malicious acts,\" and both list \"malicious acts\" after a succession\r\nof others of different generic types.  We are, of course, not bound\r\nby Bathurst.  However, we believe that the Bathurst court's\r\ninterpretation of \"malicious acts or vandalism\" in the WRSE clause,\r\nwithout any contextual limitation of the type found by the district\r\ncourt here, was sound.  \r\nBy contrast, we do not believe that the district court's\r\ninstant construction of the SR&amp;CC clause was correct.  \"Malicious\r\nacts\" is set forth in the SR&amp;CC clause as a separate, unmodified\r\nexclusion from coverage.  To be sure, it appears in a clause\r\nlabeled, \"Strikes, Riots, and Civil Commotions,\" and is preceded by\r\nother events certain of which fit generically under that label. \r\nBut nothing in the plain language and grammar of the clause\r\nsupports the district court's constriction of excludable \"malicious\r\nacts\" to only those acts perpetrated within the context of one or\r\nmore of the other co-listed events.  Nor, in our view, would an\r\nobjectively reasonable insured interpret the \"malicious acts\"\r\nexclusion so narrowly.  Like the insured in Bathurst, F&amp;D concedes,\r\nas it must, that arson by a third party is a \"malicious act.\" \r\nAccordingly, losses caused by third-party arson are excluded under\r\nthe SR&amp;CC clause.\r\nWe add that restricting \"malicious acts\" to only those\r\nmalicious acts that also fall under the previously-listed generic \r\ncategories of strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances,\r\netc. would render the \"malicious acts\" language superfluous.  For\r\nthis reason, it would be inappropriate to apply the ejusdem generiscanon of construction, under which general words following specific\r\nones are sometimes limited to the formers' objects.  The Supreme\r\nCourt has said that the ejusdem generis canon \"cannot be employed\r\nto render general words meaningless.\"  United States v. Alpers, 338\r\nU.S. 680, 682 (1950).  In the SR&amp;CC clause, losses \"in consequence\r\nof strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, civil\r\ncommotion, riots, martial law, military or usurped power\" are\r\nalready excluded from policy coverage.  That exclusion obviously\r\napplies to malicious as well as to other acts within the described\r\ngeneric categories.  Hence to limit the phrase, \"malicious acts,\"\r\nto just those activities related  to the former categories would be\r\nto render the \"malicious acts\" provision redundant, an\r\ninterpretation running counter to the customary assumption that all\r\nthe words within a clause serve some purpose.  Compare Reiter v.\r\nSonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339 (1979) (\"In construing a statute\r\nwe are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress\r\nused.\"); see also 2A J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory\r\nConstruction  46.06.  Only by reading \"malicious acts\" as\r\nincluding malicious actions beyond those associated with the\r\nearlier categories does the phraseology add in a meaningful fashion\r\nto what has already been said.\r\nHere, the malicious acts in question are arson   and not,\r\nas a practical matter, arson by the owner or its agents, which are\r\nactions separately excluded from coverage by law, but the rarer\r\nacts of fire-setting by vandals or other malicious individuals. \r\nSuch acts fall within the general category of intentional third-\r\nparty violence which can be said to be a principal overall theme \r\nof the SR&amp;CC clause.  The \"malicious acts\" category serves the\r\nrelevant purpose of excluding destructive acts \"not public or\r\ntumultuous enough to be considered a riot or civil commotion.\" \r\nHarry L. Haehl, Jr., The Hull Policy:  Coverages and Exclusions\r\nFrequently Employed:  F.C.&amp; S., War Risk, S.R. &amp; C.C., Automatic\r\nTermination, Cancellation, 41 Tulane L. Rev. 277, 286 (1967).   \r\nIn sum, the SR&amp;CC clause unambiguously excludes from\r\ncoverage losses caused by \"malicious acts,\" including arson,\r\nwhether or not the malicious acts occur in the context of one or\r\nmore of the other events listed in the SR&amp;CC clause.  Thus, on\r\nremand, the jury should be permitted to determine whether the fire\r\non July 3, 1993 was deliberately set by third parties.  Should the\r\njury answer that question in the affirmative, St. Paul would not be\r\nliable under the Hull policy. \r\nB.  St. Paul's Arson Defense  \r\nAt trial, St. Paul proceeded on the theory that F&amp;D had\r\ncommitted insurance fraud by deliberately burning the TWO FRIENDS. \r\nShortly after F&amp;D began to present its rebuttal case, the district\r\ncourt ruled from the bench that St. Paul had failed to adduce\r\nsufficient evidence of arson by the insured to reach the jury. \r\nAccordingly, although the district court considered it \"a very\r\nclose question,\" it granted F&amp;D's motion for judgment as a matter\r\nof law on the breach of contract claim.  \r\nWe review de novo the district court's grant of F&amp;D's\r\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, viewing the evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to St. Paul.  See Brennan v. GTE Government\r\nSys., 150 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 1998).  In order to present its\r\narson defense to a jury, St. Paul must provide \"more than a\r\nscintilla of evidence and may not rely on conjecture or\r\nspeculation.\"  Katz v. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.\r\n1996).  However, the court \"must not consider the credibility of\r\nthe witnesses, resolve the conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the\r\nweight of the evidence.\"  Andrade v. Jamestown Housing Auth., 82\r\nF.3d 1179, 1186 (1st Cir. 1996).  \"A verdict may be directed only\r\nif, applying these standards, the evidence does not permit a\r\nreasonable jury to find in favor of [St. Paul].\"  Brennan, 150 F.3d\r\nat 26.\r\nSt. Paul bore the burden of demonstrating at trial that\r\nservants or agents of F&amp;D deliberately set the fire aboard the TWO\r\nFRIENDS.  More specifically, Massachusetts law requires that a\r\nparty interposing an arson-by-the-insured defense prove the\r\nfollowing elements by a preponderance of the evidence:  (1) that\r\nthe fire was incendiary (deliberately set); (2) that opportunity\r\nexisted for servants or agents of the insured to set the fire; and\r\n(3) that the insured had a motive to set the fire.  See, e.g.,\r\nOsvaldo Varane, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 362 Mass.\r\n864, 865 (1972).  \r\nThe district court ruled that St. Paul had failed to\r\ncarry its burden as to each of the above elements and, thus, could\r\nnot reach the jury on its arson-by-the-insured defense.  With\r\nregard to motive, the district court concluded that since the\r\nbenefit of the insurance proceeds would have gone to Gloucester\r\nBank &amp; Trust Company and F&amp;D's creditors in the first instance, F&amp;D\r\nhad no economic motive to burn the TWO FRIENDS.  Indeed, the court\r\nconcluded that F&amp;D had strong reason not to burn the TWO FRIENDS. \r\nThe court stated:  \"Where was the advantage to the corporation or\r\nto the individuals of the family who owned it, in the destruction\r\nof their means of livelihood?\"  \r\nWith regard to opportunity, the court noted that the last\r\nagent of F&amp;D to be near the TWO FRIENDS was Leo Ferrara, Jr., who\r\nleft the vessel approximately 11 hours before the fire started. \r\nThe court concluded that since St. Paul's witnesses could not place\r\nany agent or servant of F&amp;D near the TWO FRIENDS closer in time to\r\nthe fire, the evidence of opportunity was too weak to go to the\r\njury. \r\nFinally, the district court rejected as untenable St.\r\nPaul's theory of incendiarism.  The court noted that both Malcolm\r\nand O'Donnell had testified that the fire located at the electrical\r\npanel in the engine room had ignited first.  Even assuming that the\r\nelectrical panel fire had been deliberately set, the court\r\nconcluded that it \"simply does not make sense\" that a person would\r\nset that fire and then proceed, at considerable danger to his own\r\nsafety, to ignite fires in other areas of the boat.  Indeed, the\r\ncourt described this as an \"odd way to burn a boat.\"  The \"bottom\r\nline on liability,\" in the court's view, was that St. Paul's\r\nincendiarism theory required some evidence that the fire had been\r\npre-arranged or planned.  As St. Paul did not present such\r\nevidence, the court concluded that it was \"too big a leap\" for a\r\nreasonable jury to find that F&amp;D had deliberately burned the TWO\r\nFRIENDS. \r\nWe do not disagree with the district court that the\r\narson-by-the-insured defense gives rise to close and difficult\r\nfactual questions.  Nevertheless, after careful review of the\r\nentire record, we conclude that the district court erred in\r\nwithdrawing the arson defense from the jury and directing a verdict\r\nin favor of F&amp;D.  St. Paul presented sufficient circumstantial\r\nevidence as to each of the required elements of its arson defense\r\nto reach the jury.       The circumstantial evidence of motive was\r\nstrong.  While it is true that the Ferrara family would not have\r\npocketed the proceeds of the St. Paul policy directly, Carey\r\ntestified that a complete loss of the TWO FRIENDS would have\r\nresulted in a payment of $350,000, a substantial portion of which\r\nwould have gone to extinguish the debt to the Gloucester Bank &amp;\r\nTrust Company.  Carey also testified that this payment would have\r\nsaved the personal guarantors' homes, which had been pledged as\r\nadditional security to the bank.  Further, there was substantial\r\nevidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that F&amp;D had\r\nnever been a profitable venture, and, given its considerable debt\r\nobligations, was in dire straits financially at the time of the\r\nfire.  This was sufficient evidence of motive to reach the jury. \r\nSee Osvaldo, 362 Mass. at 865 (insured's business experiencing\r\nfinancial difficulties, payments to mortgagees in arrears, accounts\r\npayable far exceeded accounts receivable, and home had suffered\r\nforeclosure).  \r\nThe evidence with regard to opportunity was somewhat\r\nweaker.  The court found it significant that no servant or agent of\r\nF&amp;D had been seen near the TWO FRIENDS at or near the time of the\r\nfire.  Such direct evidence is not required to present an arson\r\ndefense to the jury.  There was undisputed testimony that there\r\nwere only four keys to the TWO FRIENDS, three of which were in the\r\npossession of agents of F&amp;D, the other being in the possession of\r\nthe wharf owner.  The evidence that access to the vessel was\r\nlimited and that the Gloucester Fire Department had to force entry\r\nwhen it arrived on the scene may have led the jury, if permitted to\r\nconsider it, to find that the arsonist had a key.  See Richardsonv. Travelers Fire Ins. Co., 288 Mass. 391, 396 (1934) (evidence\r\nwarranted finding that insured alone had key which would permit\r\nperson to enter house and leave it locked up as it was when firemen\r\narrived); see also Gregory's Continental Coiffures &amp; Boutique, Inc.v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 536 F.2d 1187, 1191 (7th Cir.\r\n1976) (reversing directed verdict for insured where evidence that\r\naccess to premises was limited could have resulted in jury\r\ndetermination that insured had procured someone to start fire and\r\nhad given individual a key).\r\nAs said, the \"bottom line\" to the district court on\r\nliability was its concern that the jury would have to speculate or\r\nunreasonably \"leap\" in order to accept St. Paul's incendiarism\r\ntheory.  It is true that if one fully accepts the testimony of\r\nMalcolm and O'Donnell that the fire at the electrical panel in the\r\nengine room ignited first, the timing of the fires appears somewhat\r\n\"odd.\"  We do not believe, however, that this was sufficient reason\r\nto withdraw the arson defense from the jury.  The jury, not the\r\njudge, is the fact-finder.  The incendiarism element of an arson\r\ndefense does not require that the insurer prove the arsonist chose\r\nthe most logical or safest method for setting a fire, or that the\r\nfire was carefully planned or pre-arranged by members of the\r\ncorporation.  \r\nIt does not matter that the trial judge drew a different\r\ninference or conclusion from the evidence presented or \"[felt] that\r\nother results [were] more reasonable.\"  Boston &amp; M.R.R. v. Caban,\r\n148 F.2d 150, 152 (1st Cir. 1945).  It was for the jury to weigh\r\nthe testimony of Malcolm and O'Donnell and all the other evidence\r\nin order to determine whether the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS was\r\ndeliberately set.  Malcolm and O'Donnell both testified that at\r\nleast three, and possibly four, separate fires had been set, and\r\nthat there was no evidence of \"communication\" between them. \r\nO'Donnell testified that some of the samples taken from the vessel\r\nshowed traces of diesel fuel and that, in his opinion, the fire\r\nlocated on the port side of the engine room had been set by someone\r\nplacing a container filled with accelerant in the forward port\r\ncorner of the engine room next to the hydraulic tank hoses.  We\r\ncannot say that a jury presented with this evidence lacked\r\nsufficient basis from which to conclude that multiple fires were\r\ndeliberately set aboard the TWO FRIENDS. \r\nThe district court stated that it was aware of no case\r\n\"where the evidence of fraud is, or arson, is as thin and slender\r\nas it is in this case.\"  However, the evidence of arson presented\r\nby St. Paul was similar in both substance and character to other\r\nevidence found sufficient under Massachusetts case law to sustain\r\nan arson defense.  See Osvaldo, 362 Mass. at 864-65 (expert\r\nevidence indicated presence of accelerant, insured's business\r\nexperiencing financial difficulties, and insured seen near premises\r\napproximately one hour prior to fire); see also Richardson, 288\r\nMass. at 396-97 (fire incendiary in origin, doors and windows\r\nlocked when firemen arrived, and insured was \"in need of money\"), \r\ncf. Demoranville v. Star Ins. Co. of America, 319 Mass. 214, 215\r\n(1946) (finding of arson not warranted where no evidence that\r\nproperty burned was a bad investment, some of the windows could be\r\nopened from outside, and no evidence to show how the fire started). \r\nAs in Osvaldo and Richardson, the evidence in this case was\r\ncircumstantial in nature.  Inferences can, of course, properly be\r\ndrawn from circumstantial evidence.  Each case necessarily turns on\r\nits own facts, and evidence of opportunity, for example, may be\r\nstronger in one case than in another.  The question is whether,\r\nviewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to St. Paul\r\nand giving it the benefit of every legitimate inference, reasonable\r\njurors nonetheless could have come to but one conclusion, a\r\nconclusion adverse to St. Paul.  We conclude that reasonable jurors\r\ncould determine that F&amp;D deliberately set fire to the TWO FRIENDS\r\nin order to fraudulently obtain the proceeds of the insurance\r\npolicy.  Therefore, we reverse the directed verdict in favor of\r\nF&amp;D.\r\n\nC.  Violation of Massachusetts Unfair Practices Statute\r\nThe district court granted St. Paul's motion for summary\r\njudgment on F&amp;D's claim, brought pursuant to Mass. Gen. Laws chs.\r\n93A and 176D, that St. Paul refused to settle the claim under the\r\nHull policy in bad faith.  We review the district court's grant of\r\nsummary judgment de novo and view all facts in the light most\r\nfavorable to F&amp;D, drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor. \r\nSee Aponte Matos v. Toledo Davila, 135 F.3d 182, 186 (1st Cir.\r\n1998).\r\nIt is an unfair settlement practice, and also an unfair\r\nor deceptive act or practice under Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 93A, if\r\nan insurance company fails \"to effectuate prompt, fair and\r\nequitable settlements of claims in which liability has become\r\nreasonably clear.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D,  3(9)(f).  SeeEquitable Life Assurance Soc'y of the United States v. Porter-\r\nEnglehart, 867 F.2d 79, 88 (1st Cir. 1989) (those injured by\r\ninsurance practices proscribed by chapter 176D may sue under\r\nchapter 93A).  Section 3 of chapter 176D lists eleven unfair claim\r\nsettlement practices, including \"[r]efusing to pay claims without\r\nconducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available\r\ninformation.\"  Mass. Gen. Laws. ch. 176D,  3(9)(d).  F&amp;D does not\r\nassert that St. Paul failed to conduct a reasonable investigation\r\nbefore denying its claim, but rather bases its unfair practices\r\nclaim solely upon St. Paul's failure to pay under the Hull policy\r\nwhen, after its investigation was completed, liability under the\r\npolicy was \"reasonably clear.\"\r\nF&amp;D has failed to point to sufficient evidence supporting\r\nits unfair practices claim to avoid summary judgment.  St. Paul's\r\nrefusal to settle the claim was based, in part, upon the expert\r\nopinions of Malcolm and O'Donnell, who concluded that the fires\r\naboard the TWO FRIENDS had been deliberately set.  We have\r\nconcluded that those opinions, along with the other evidence\r\nsupporting St. Paul's arson-by-the-insured defense, entitle St.\r\nPaul to present the liability issue to the jury.  Under these\r\ncircumstances, it cannot be said that liability is \"reasonably\r\nclear,\" even at this stage of the proceedings.  Insurers are both\r\nencouraged and entitled to rely, as St. Paul did here, on the\r\nadvice of expert consultants in evaluating liability.  See Van Dykev. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 388 Mass. 671, 677-78 (1983)\r\n(affirming summary judgment in favor of insurer on claim of failure\r\nto settle where information provided by defense counsel and expert\r\nwitness established that liability was not reasonably clear); seealso DeMeo v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 38 Mass. App. Ct.\r\n955, 957 (1995) (liability not reasonably clear where objective\r\ninquiry into applicable facts and law indicated 50% possibility\r\nthat driver other than insured would be found sole cause of\r\naccident by jury).\r\nF&amp;D attempts to bolster its unfair practices claim by\r\nasserting that Malcolm's taking possession of the electrical panels\r\nwithout obtaining F&amp;D's permission and the belated production,\r\nafter trial, of the DuBois report, in which DuBois concurred with\r\nthe preliminary conclusion of the Gloucester Fire Department that\r\nthe cause of the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS was electrical in\r\nnature, constituted \"unfair or deceptive act[s] or practice[s]\"\r\nunder chapter 93A.  \r\nThe unauthorized removal of the electrical panels and the\r\nfailure to produce the DuBois report, while disturbing, fail to\r\nsave F&amp;D's Chapter 93A claim.  In order to make out a claim under\r\nchapters 93A and 176D, a claimant \"must establish both that an\r\nunfair trade practice occurred and that the unfair practice\r\nresulted in a loss to the claimant.\"  Alan Corp. v. Int'l Surplus\r\nLines Ins. Co., 22 F.3d 339, 343 (1st Cir. 1994) (italics in\r\noriginal).  There was no evidence that St. Paul removed the\r\nelectrical panels from the TWO FRIENDS for any improper purpose, or\r\nthat the delay in returning them to F&amp;D caused any harm whatsoever\r\nto F&amp;D.  Thus, F&amp;D has failed to demonstrate that it suffered any\r\nloss as a result of this conduct.  \r\nRespecting the late production of the DuBois report, this\r\nas the district court stated   might more accurately be described\r\nas a possible abuse of the discovery process than an unfair or\r\ndeceptive \"business practice.\"  In any event, F&amp;D has not shown a\r\ncausal link between the late production of the DuBois report, which\r\nwas created prior to the completion of the investigation by Malcolm\r\nand O'Donnell, and St. Paul's refusal to settle under the Hull\r\npolicy, the alleged loss to F&amp;D, which was based upon the later\r\nopinions of Malcolm and O'Donnell. \r\nWe affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\nin favor of St. Paul on the chapter 93A claim.  We reverse the\r\ncourt's ruling that losses caused by arson committed by a third\r\nparty are covered under the Hull policy, and reverse the directed\r\nverdict in favor of F&amp;D on the breach of contract claim.  The\r\njudgment on the breach of contract claim is vacated and the cause\r\nremanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \r\nEach side shall bear its own costs on these appeals.\r\nSo ordered.\n",

BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F &amp; D was a closely-held, family corporation engaged in the commercial fishing trade.  The corporation had four officers:  Leonardo Ferrara, Sr., Vito Ferrara, Ambrose Ferrara, and Francesco DiMercurio.  Six individuals, all family members, owned shares in the company:  Leonardo Ferrara, Sr., Vito Ferrara, Ambrose Ferrara, Francesco DiMercurio, Vincenza Ferrara, and Enza DiMercurio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, F &amp; D purchased the commercial fishing vessel F/V TWO FRIENDS for $375,000 with the proceeds of a loan from the Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company.  As a condition of the loan, members of the Ferrara family agreed to act as personal guarantors of F &amp; D's note.  In addition, Vincenza Ferrara and Francesco DiMercurio pledged their homes as additional security.  The TWO FRIENDS was the sole physical asset owned by F &amp; D. It was insured for $350,000 under a Marine Hull and Machinery policy issued to F &amp; D in 1992 by St. Paul.  The Hull policy that was issued by St. Paul was an American Institute AHAB Form policy, revised as of July 1, 1962.  The TWO FRIENDS was also insured for $350,000 under a War Risk policy issued to F &amp; D by Underwriters at Lloyd's, London.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> James Carey, St. Paul's accounting and financial expert, testified that F &amp; D had operated at a loss from the moment of its formation.  Carey testified that F &amp; D had considerable difficulty in making timely loan payments to Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company.  Because F &amp; D was habitually late in making its payments, the bank made demand in July, 1991, for payment in full of the outstanding loan, an amount in excess of $290,000.  In November 1991, the bank made demand upon the personal guarantors of F &amp; D's note for payment in full of the outstanding loan.  Also in November 1991, the bank filed a lawsuit to foreclose on the residence of Vincenza Ferrara.  After a period of negotiation, the bank, F &amp; D, and the personal guarantors reached an agreement in January 1992, whereby the bank would forebear from proceeding to judgment in the foreclosure action so long as $15,000 was paid to the bank and monthly payments were kept current thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the January 1992 agreement, Carey testified that F &amp; D continued to have difficulty making timely payments to the bank.  At a meeting in April 1993, F &amp; D and representatives of Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company agreed that F &amp; D would attempt to sell the TWO FRIENDS for $225,000.  On April 15, 1993, F &amp; D entered into an exclusive brokerage agreement with Ahern Marine Agency, Inc. in an effort to sell the TWO FRIENDS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 1993, the TWO FRIENDS returned to Gloucester from a five-day fishing trip with Leo Ferrara, Jr. and three crew members aboard.  Leo Ferrara, Jr., the ship's engineer, testified that he left the TWO FRIENDS at approximately 4:30 p.m., and that he was the last crew member to leave the vessel.  He further testified that prior to leaving the vessel, he had locked all of the doors both upstairs and downstairs.  He testified that the only way to gain access to the TWO FRIENDS once these doors were locked was through the door on the crew quarters level, which he had secured with a padlock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 3, 1993, at approximately 2:30 a.m., the TWO FRIENDS caught fire while tied to her berth at the Frontiero Brothers, Inc. wharf.  When the Gloucester Fire Department arrived, firefighters discovered that the only door through which they could gain entry to the TWO FRIENDS was located on the crew quarters level and was padlocked.  The firefighters cut the padlock in order to enter.  The Gloucester Fire Department's preliminary report, which was prepared on July 4, 1993, indicated that the cause of the fire was electrical in nature, but the origin uncertain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leo Ferrara, Jr. and Vito Ferrara both testified that at the time of the fire, there were only four keys to the padlock used to secure the door on the crew quarters level. One of the keys was in the possession of Leonardo Ferrara, Sr., the president of F &amp; D, one was in the possession of his son, Vito Ferrara, the vice-president of the corporation, one was in the possession of Leo Ferrara, Jr., and the final key was hanging, along with the keys to other vessels, inside a warehouse on the Frontiero Brothers, Inc. wharf.  Pasquale Frontiero, the owner of the wharf, testified that on the night of the fire he had locked the warehouse prior to going home for the evening.  He testified that a few days after the fire, he noticed that the key to the TWO FRIENDS was still hanging in its usual location inside the warehouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving notification of the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS, St. Paul retained Fred O'Donnell, a fire scene analyst, and John Malcolm, a forensic electrical fire consultant, to investigate the cause and origin of the fire.  O'Donnell and Malcolm first visited the fire scene on July 8, 1993.  They were accompanied by David DuBois, a marine surveyor who had also been retained by St. Paul.  On this initial visit, Malcolm, DuBois, and O'Donnell conducted a visual inspection of the TWO FRIENDS and O'Donnell took samples from the crew quarters and galley areas to determine whether an accelerant was present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malcolm and O'Donnell returned to the vessel on August 3, 1993, to obtain the electrical panels, ostensibly for inspection and possible subrogation claims.  At the request of counsel for St. Paul, but without obtaining authorization from F &amp; D, O'Donnell and Malcolm removed the electrical panels from the TWO FRIENDS.  The panels were placed in an evidence storage locker at Malcolm's laboratory and were provided to counsel for F &amp; D upon his request.  O'Donnell testified that based upon his examination of burn patterns, he was able to identify points of origin for at least three, and possibly four, separate fires aboard the TWO FRIENDS.  He testified that one point of origin was located adjacent to a bunk in the port side crew quarters bunkroom, and another point of origin was located one deck below the crew quarters in the engine room at an electrical panel on the forward starboard side bulkhead.  O'Donnell testified that a third point of origin was also located in the engine room, on the port side next to the main hydraulic tank.  Finally, O'Donnell testified that there was an area of \"heavy burn\" in the galley area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Donnell testified that two of the three samples he had taken from the crew's quarters contained traces of diesel fuel, but that none of the samples taken from the galley area contained evidence of an accelerant.  He further testified that, in his opinion, the fire on the port side of the engine room was set by someone placing a container filled with accelerant in the forward port corner of the engine room next to the hydraulic tank hoses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malcolm investigated the vessel's electrical system to determine whether it played any part in the fire.  He testified that based upon his interview of Leo Ferrara, Jr. on July 8, 1993, it did not appear that the TWO FRIENDS had experienced any electrical difficulties on the July 2, 1993 fishing trip.  Malcolm testified that he found no evidence that the electrical system had played any role in the fires in the bunkroom or in the fire that originated in the engine room on the port side.  He testified, however, that he did find evidence of the escape of electricity, or \"arcing,\" in the electrical panel on the forward starboard side bulkhead in the engine room.  Malcolm testified that, based upon his examination of the vessel's electrical system, it was his opinion that the fire in the electrical panel in the engine room was the first fire to ignite on July 3, 1993.  Malcolm also concluded in his written report, drafted on July 22, 1993, and testified at trial that the burn patterns in the area of the electrical panel were consistent with an accidental electrical fire.  He specifically noted in his report and testified that it was possible for persons to intentionally set up the burning of an electrical panel to make the fire appear accidental, but that he had discovered no electrical evidence that this had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Donnell and Malcolm both testified that there was no evidence of \"communication,\" or connection, between either of the two fires in the engine room and the fires in the crew quarters or between the two fires in the engine room.  Based upon the arcing in the engine room electrical panel and the absence of arcing elsewhere in the ship's electrical system, Malcolm concluded that the fire in the crew quarters could not have ignited the fire in the electrical panel in the engine room.  Malcolm and O'Donnell both concluded that the fire at the electrical panel was not the source of the fire in the crew quarters, as there was no evidence that the electrical panel fire had spread upward from the panel.  Based upon his examination of the burn patterns on the engine room floor boards, O'Donnell concluded that the fire in the electrical panel on the starboard side of the engine room did not cause the fire on the port side of the engine room next to the hydraulic tank.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Given the absence of evidence of communication among the various fires originating at different locations on the vessel, as well as the evidence that an accelerant was present in the crew quarters and on the port side of the engine room, O'Donnell testified that, in his opinion, the fires aboard the TWO FRIENDS had been deliberately set by someone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carey, the accounting expert, testified that at the time of the fire, F &amp; D owed a total of $426,000 to various creditors.  He further testified that to meet its financial obligations at the time of the fire, F &amp; D would have had to generate revenues from its fishing operation of approximately $380,000 per year.  Carey testified that F &amp; D had never been that profitable in all its years of operation.  Carey also testified that had the July 3, 1993 fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS resulted in a total loss of the vessel, and had St. Paul paid the full proceeds of the Hull policy, F &amp; D would have gained $350,000 to be applied to its debts.  Carey stated that as a loss payee under the policy, the Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company would have had its note paid in full, and that this payment would have extinguished the personal liability of the guarantors of the note and avoided the loss of the personal guarantors' homes.  By contrast, Carey testified that had the vessel been sold for $225,000, the bank loans would not have been paid in full, the personal liability of the guarantors would not have been extinguished, and the homes of the personal guarantors would have remained in jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, St. Paul requested a ruling of law that losses caused by arson committed by a party other than the insured were not covered under the Hull policy.  The \"Perils\" clause of the Hull policy under which the TWO FRIENDS was insured listed \"Fire\" as a covered peril.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  St. Paul argued, however, that only fires that are \"fortuitous\" and \"of the Sea\" are covered under the Perils clause, and that the fire in this case met neither requirement.  St. Paul argued, in the alternative, that the Strikes, Riots, and Civil Commotions(\"SR &amp; CC\") clause excluded arson by third parties from coverage under the Hull policy.  The SR &amp; CC clause stated:  \"Warranted free of loss, damage or expense in consequence of strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, civil commotion, riots, martial law, military or usurped power or malicious acts.\"  (emphasis supplied).  The district court ruled that all fires, with the exception of those intentionally set by the insured, were insured under the Perils clause.  The court further ruled that although arson by a third party was a \"malicious act,\" the SR &amp; CC clause did not exclude from coverage losses caused by fires intentionally set by third parties unless the arson was somehow \"connected with\" a strike, lockout, political or labor disturbance, riot, or some other event set forth in the SR &amp; CC clause.  As the arson alleged by St. Paul did not fit within any of these categories, the district court ruled that the Hull policy provided coverage for losses caused as a result of the burning of the TWO FRIENDS by a third party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denied the opportunity to defend on the further ground that the vessel had been intentionally burned by unknown third parties, St. Paul concentrated at trial on the defense of arson-by-the-insured.  In order to prevail on this defense, Massachusetts law required that St. Paul prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (1) the fire was incendiary in nature;  (2) F &amp; D had a motive to set the fire;  and (3) F &amp; D or its agents had an opportunity to set the fire.  See infra.   St. Paul presented the evidence recounted above, including its experts' opinions that multiple fires were deliberately set aboard the TWO FRIENDS, the evidence concerning the financial difficulties encountered by F &amp; D prior to the fire, and the limited availability of keys to the locked vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After St. Paul presented its arson defense,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> F &amp; D moved for judgment as a matter of law.  The district court denied the motion and ruled that whether St. Paul had proved its arson defense was \"a question for the jury.\"   However, shortly after F &amp; D had begun to put on its rebuttal case, the district court reconsidered its prior ruling and directed a verdict in favor of F &amp; D. While the court considered it \"a very close question,\" it concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by St. Paul was not sufficient to allow a jury to return a verdict in its favor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the court allowed the parties to undertake additional discovery on F &amp; D's claim that St. Paul's refusal to settle under the Hull policy constituted an unfair or deceptive business practice under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A. During this additional discovery period, St. Paul produced, for the first time, a report that had been prepared by its marine surveyor, David DuBois, on July 9, 1993, in which DuBois concurred with the preliminary conclusion of the Gloucester Fire Department that the fire on July 3, 1993, was electrical in nature.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on F &amp; D's Chapter 93A claim.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of St. Paul.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have filed cross-appeals challenging the rulings of the district court.  For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the district court erred in ruling that losses caused by fires intentionally set by third parties were not excluded by the SR &amp; CC clause from coverage under the Hull policy.  We reverse the directed verdict granted in favor of F &amp; D on the breach of contract claim, but affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of St. Paul on the Chapter 93A claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Arson By Third Parties</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's interpretation of the St. Paul Hull insurance policy.  See St. Paul Fire and Marine Ins. Co. v. Warwick Dyeing Corp., 26 F.3d 1195, 1199 (1st Cir.1994).  We are guided by several familiar rules of construction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  In examining the language of the policy, we consider \"what an objectively reasonable insured, reading the relevant policy language, would expect to be covered.\"  Trustees of Tufts Univ. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 415 Mass. 844, 849, 616 N.E.2d 68 (1993) (quoting Hazen Paper Co. v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co., 407 Mass. 689, 700, 555 N.E.2d 576 (1990)).  Absent ambiguity, we give policy language its plain and ordinary meaning.  See Cody v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., 387 Mass. 142, 146, 439 N.E.2d 234 (1982).  Any ambiguity is resolved against the insurer, who drafted the policy, and in favor of the insured.  Thus, \"if there are two rational interpretations of policy language, the insured is entitled to the benefit of the one that is more favorable to it.\"  Hazen, 407 Mass. at 700, 555 N.E.2d 576.   The insured bears the burden of proving that a claim falls within the grant of coverage, which, once established, shifts the burden to the insurer to show the applicability of any exclusion.  Camp Dresser &amp; McKee, Inc. v. Home Ins. Co., 30 Mass.App.Ct. 318, 321, 568 N.E.2d 631 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Paul asserts that the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS, if deliberately set by a third party, was not covered under the Perils clause of the Hull policy because it was not \"of the seas\" or \"fortuitous.\"   See G. Gilmore &amp; C. Black, The Law of Admiralty, &#167; 2-9, p. 72 (2d ed.1975) (perils \"of the sea\" are \"fortuitous losses occurring through extraordinary action of the elements at sea, or any accident or mishap in navigation\").  St. Paul misreads the Perils clause.  See n. 6, supra.  \"Fire\" is specified as a covered peril in itself, separate and apart from the perils \"of the sea.\"   See Rosa v. Insurance Co. of the State of Pennsylvania, 421 F.2d 390, 392 (9th Cir.1970) (interpreting nearly identical perils clause to provide coverage for electrical fire).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  St. Paul's interpretation of the Perils clause would result in a denial of coverage even if the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS were found to be entirely accidental in nature, since the fire would not have resulted from the elements at sea or navigational accident, and, thus, would not be \"of the seas.\"   That is not a rational construction of the Perils clause.  Indeed, St. Paul consistently disavowed such an interpretation below, contending instead that coverage was not available under the Hull policy because the loss had been caused by the intentional burning of the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Paul's focus on the Perils clause is misplaced, as F &amp; D carried its burden of proving that accidental fires fall within the grant of coverage under the Perils clause.  The burden shifted to St. Paul to demonstrate that a fire set deliberately by a third party was, as the Perils clause states, \"excluded by provisions elsewhere in the Policy or by endorsement.\"   St. Paul asserts that the SR &amp; CC clause, which excludes from coverage \"loss, damage or expense in consequence of strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, civil commotion, riots, martial law, military or usurped power or malicious acts,\" excludes losses caused by third-party arson.  The district court, however, construed the SR &amp; CC clause narrowly as excluding only losses caused by malicious acts that are performed within the context of \"strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, civil commotion, riots, martial law, military or usurped power.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F &amp; D concedes that arson by a third party constitutes a \"malicious act.\"   F &amp; D urges us, however, to affirm the district court's constricted reading of the SR &amp; CC clause.  Like the district court, we have found little guidance in the case law as to the proper construction of the language at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The parties rely primarily upon the decision of the district court in O'DonnellUsen Fisheries v. Bathurst, 664 F.Supp. 37 (D.Mass.1987).  In Bathurst, the F/V Ann C. Spencer was destroyed by fire.  A party unrelated to the insured was charged with arson of the vessel, but later acquitted.  The insurer argued that arson by a third party was not covered by the insurance policy.  The district court examined in some detail the interplay between marine Hull policies, such as the one at issue here, and War Risk policies.  The latter, as the court pointed out, provide coverage for those risks precluded from coverage under Hull clauses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  In Bathurst, the insured, unlike F &amp; D, did not have a Hull policy.  Nevertheless, the district court read the applicable War Risk policy to provide coverage for only those risks that a Hull policy would have covered but for the preclusion from coverage under its War, Strikes and Related Exclusions (\"WSRE\") clause.  The court utilized the WSRE clause from the 1970 version of the American Institute Hull Clauses (\"AIHC\") form, which excluded from coverage any losses caused by, inter alia, \"malicious acts or vandalism.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The insured conceded that arson was a \"malicious act or vandalism.\"   Thus, the court concluded that \"when malicious acts or vandalism occur in the form of arson the loss is precluded from coverage by the [WRSE clause].\"  Id. at 41.   Since the WRSE clause of the Hull policy excluded coverage for losses caused by arson perpetrated by a third party, the court held that the War Risk policy provided coverage for such losses.  See id. at 42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Paul argues that Bathurst supports its claim that arson by a third party is excluded under the SR &amp; CC clause, while F &amp; D asserts that Bathurst is distinguishable, as the court was interpreting a different insurance form than was used to insure the TWO FRIENDS.  The district court agreed with F &amp; D and distinguished Bathurst on the ground that the SR &amp; CC clause in the St. Paul policy was \"narrower\" than the WRSE clause construed by the court in Bathurst.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no important distinction, however, between the language used in the 1962 AHAB Form used by St. Paul and the 1970 AIHC Form construed by the district court in Bathurst.   The language used in the two policy forms is nearly identical.  Both clauses exclude coverage for losses caused by, inter alia, \"malicious acts,\" and both list \"malicious acts\" after a succession of others of different generic types.  We are, of course, not bound by Bathurst.   However, we believe that the Bathurst court's interpretation of \"malicious acts or vandalism\" in the WRSE clause, without any contextual limitation of the type found by the district court here, was sound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, we do not believe that the district court's instant construction of the SR &amp; CC clause was correct.  \"Malicious acts\" is set forth in the SR &amp; CC clause as a separate, unmodified exclusion from coverage.  To be sure, it appears in a clause labeled, \"Strikes, Riots, and Civil Commotions,\" and is preceded by other events certain of which fit generically under that label.  But nothing in the plain language and grammar of the clause supports the district court's constriction of excludable \"malicious acts\" to only those acts perpetrated within the context of one or more of the other co-listed events.  Nor, in our view, would an objectively reasonable insured interpret the \"malicious acts\" exclusion so narrowly.  Like the insured in Bathurst, F &amp; D concedes, as it must, that arson by a third party is a \"malicious act.\"   Accordingly, losses caused by third-party arson are excluded under the SR &amp; CC clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that restricting \"malicious acts\" to only those malicious acts that also fall under the previously-listed generic categories of strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, etc. would render the \"malicious acts\" language superfluous.  For this reason, it would be inappropriate to apply the ejusdem generis canon of construction, under which general words following specific ones are sometimes limited to the formers' objects.  The Supreme Court has said that the ejusdem generis canon \"cannot be employed to render general words meaningless.\"  United States v. Alpers, 338 U.S. 680, 682, 70 S.Ct. 352, 94 L.Ed. 457 (1950).  In the SR &amp; CC clause, losses \"in consequence of strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, civil commotion, riots, martial law, military or usurped power\" are already excluded from policy coverage.  That exclusion obviously applies to malicious as well as to other acts within the described generic categories.  Hence to limit the phrase, \"malicious acts,\" to just those activities related to the former categories would be to render the \"malicious acts\" provision redundant, an interpretation running counter to the customary assumption that all the words within a clause serve some purpose.  Compare Reiter v. Sonotone Corp., 442 U.S. 330, 339, 99 S.Ct. 2326, 60 L.Ed.2d 931 (1979) (\"In construing a statute we are obliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\");   see also 2A J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#167; 46.06.  Only by reading \"malicious acts\" as including malicious actions beyond those associated with the earlier categories does the phraseology add in a meaningful fashion to what has already been said.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the malicious acts in question are arson--and not, as a practical matter, arson by the owner or its agents, which are actions separately excluded from coverage by law, but the rarer acts of fire-setting by vandals or other malicious individuals.  Such acts fall within the general category of intentional third-party violence which can be said to be a principal overall theme of the SR &amp; CC clause.  The \"malicious acts\" category serves the relevant purpose of excluding destructive acts \"not public or tumultuous enough to be considered a riot or civil commotion.\"   Harry L. Haehl, Jr., The Hull Policy:  Coverages and Exclusions Frequently Employed:  F.C. &amp; S., War Risk, S.R. &amp; C.C., Automatic Termination, Cancellation, 41 Tulane L.Rev. 277, 286 (1967).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  In sum, the SR &amp; CC clause unambiguously excludes from coverage losses caused by \"malicious acts,\" including arson, whether or not the malicious acts occur in the context of one or more of the other events listed in the SR &amp; CC clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a>  Thus, on remand, the jury should be permitted to determine whether the fire on July 3, 1993 was deliberately set by third parties.  Should the jury answer that question in the affirmative, St. Paul would not be liable under the Hull policy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

Shortly after F &amp; D began to present its rebuttal case, the district court ruled from the bench that St. Paul had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of arson by the insured to reach the jury.  Accordingly, although the district court considered it \"a very close question,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> it granted F &amp; D's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the breach of contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo the district court's grant of F &amp; D's motion for judgment as a matter of law, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to St. Paul.  See Brennan v. GTE Government Sys., 150 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir.1998).  In order to present its arson defense to a jury, St. Paul must provide \"more than a scintilla of evidence and may not rely on conjecture or speculation.\"  Katz v. City Metal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 28 (1st Cir.1996).  However, the court \"must not consider the credibility of the witnesses, resolve the conflicts in testimony, or evaluate the weight of the evidence.\"  Andrade v. Jamestown Housing Auth., 82 F.3d 1179, 1186 (1st Cir.1996).  \"A verdict may be directed only if, applying these standards, the evidence does not permit a reasonable jury to find in favor of [St. Paul].\" Brennan, 150 F.3d at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Paul bore the burden of demonstrating at trial that servants or agents of F &amp; D deliberately set the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS.  More specifically, Massachusetts law requires that a party interposing an arson-by-the-insured defense prove the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence:  (1) that the fire was incendiary (deliberately set);  (2) that opportunity existed for servants or agents of the insured to set the fire;  and (3) that the insured had a motive to set the fire.  See, e.g., Osvaldo Varane, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 362 Mass. 864, 865, 284 N.E.2d 923 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that St. Paul had failed to carry its burden as to each of the above elements and, thus, could not reach the jury on its arson-by-the-insured defense.  With regard to motive, the district court concluded that since the benefit of the insurance proceeds would have gone to Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company and F &amp; D's creditors in the first instance, F &amp; D had no economic motive to burn the TWO FRIENDS.  Indeed, the court concluded that F &amp; D had strong reason not to burn the TWO FRIENDS.  The court stated:  \"Where was the advantage to the corporation or to the individuals of the family who owned it, in the destruction of their means of livelihood?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to opportunity, the court noted that the last agent of F &amp; D to be near the TWO FRIENDS was Leo Ferrara, Jr., who left the vessel approximately 11 hours before the fire started.  The court concluded that since St. Paul's witnesses could not place any agent or servant of F &amp; D near the TWO FRIENDS closer in time to the fire, the evidence of opportunity was too weak to go to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court rejected as untenable St. Paul's theory of incendiarism.  The court noted that both Malcolm and O'Donnell had testified that the fire located at the electrical panel in the engine room had ignited first.  Even assuming that the electrical panel fire had been deliberately set, the court concluded that it \"simply does not make sense\" that a person would set that fire and then proceed, at considerable danger to his own safety, to ignite fires in other areas of the boat.  Indeed, the court described this as an \"odd way to burn a boat.\"   The \"bottom line on liability,\" in the court's view, was that St. Paul's incendiarism theory required some evidence that the fire had been pre-arranged or planned.  As St. Paul did not present such evidence, the court concluded that it was \"too big a leap\" for a reasonable jury to find that F &amp; D had deliberately burned the TWO FRIENDS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not disagree with the district court that the arson-by-the-insured defense gives rise to close and difficult factual questions.  Nevertheless, after careful review of the entire record, we conclude that the district court erred in withdrawing the arson defense from the jury and directing a verdict in favor of F &amp; D. St. Paul presented sufficient circumstantial evidence as to each of the required elements of its arson defense to reach the jury.  The circumstantial evidence of motive was strong.  While it is true that the Ferrara family would not have pocketed the proceeds of the St. Paul policy directly, Carey testified that a complete loss of the TWO FRIENDS would have resulted in a payment of $350,000, a substantial portion of which would have gone to extinguish the debt to the Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company.  Carey also testified that this payment would have saved the personal guarantors' homes, which had been pledged as additional security to the bank.  Further, there was substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that F &amp; D had never been a profitable venture, and, given its considerable debt obligations, was in dire straits financially at the time of the fire.  This was sufficient evidence of motive to reach the jury.  See Osvaldo, 362 Mass. at 865, 284 N.E.2d 923 (insured's business experiencing financial difficulties, payments to mortgagees in arrears, accounts payable far exceeded accounts receivable, and home had suffered foreclosure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence with regard to opportunity was somewhat weaker.  The court found it significant that no servant or agent of F &amp; D had been seen near the TWO FRIENDS at or near the time of the fire.  Such direct evidence is not required to present an arson defense to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  There was undisputed testimony that there were only four keys to the TWO FRIENDS, three of which were in the possession of agents of F &amp; D, the other being in the possession of the wharf owner.  The evidence that access to the vessel was limited and that the Gloucester Fire Department had to force entry when it arrived on the scene may have led the jury, if permitted to consider it, to find that the arsonist had a key.  See Richardson v. Travelers' Fire Ins. Co., 288 Mass. 391, 396, 193 N.E. 40 (1934) (evidence warranted finding that insured alone had key which would permit person to enter house and leave it locked up as it was when firemen arrived);  see also Gregory's Continental Coiffures &amp; Boutique, Inc. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., 536 F.2d 1187, 1191 (7th Cir.1976) (reversing directed verdict for insured where evidence that access to premises was limited could have resulted in jury determination that insured had procured someone to start fire and had given individual a key).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the \"bottom line\" to the district court on liability was its concern that the jury would have to speculate or unreasonably \"leap\" in order to accept St. Paul's incendiarism theory.  It is true that if one fully accepts the testimony of Malcolm and O'Donnell that the fire at the electrical panel in the engine room ignited first, the timing of the fires appears somewhat \"odd.\"   We do not believe, however, that this was sufficient reason to withdraw the arson defense from the jury.  The jury, not the judge, is the fact-finder.  The incendiarism element of an arson defense does not require that the insurer prove the arsonist chose the most logical or safest method for setting a fire, or that the fire was carefully planned or pre-arranged by members of the corporation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does not matter that the trial judge drew a different inference or conclusion from the evidence presented or \"[felt] that other results [were] more reasonable.\"  Boston &amp; M.R.R. v. Cabana, 148 F.2d 150, 152 (1st Cir.1945).  It was for the jury to weigh the testimony of Malcolm and O'Donnell and all the other evidence in order to determine whether the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS was deliberately set.  Malcolm and O'Donnell both testified that at least three, and possibly four, separate fires had been set, and that there was no evidence of \"communication\" between them.  O'Donnell testified that some of the samples taken from the vessel showed traces of diesel fuel and that, in his opinion, the fire located on the port side of the engine room had been set by someone placing a container filled with accelerant in the forward port corner of the engine room next to the hydraulic tank hoses.  We cannot say that a jury presented with this evidence lacked sufficient basis from which to conclude that multiple fires were deliberately set aboard the TWO FRIENDS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that it was aware of no case \"where the evidence of fraud is, or arson, is as thin and slender as it is in this case.\"   However, the evidence of arson presented by St. Paul was similar in both substance and character to other evidence found sufficient under Massachusetts case law to sustain an arson defense.  See Osvaldo, 362 Mass. at 864-65, 284 N.E.2d 923 (expert evidence indicated presence of accelerant, insured's business experiencing financial difficulties, and insured seen near premises approximately one hour prior to fire);  see also Richardson, 288 Mass. at 396-97, 193 N.E. 40 (fire incendiary in origin, doors and windows locked when firemen arrived, and insured was \"in need of money\"), cf.  Demoranville v. Star Ins. Co. of America, 319 Mass. 214, 215, 65 N.E.2d 315 (1946) (finding of arson not warranted where no evidence that property burned was a bad investment, some of the windows could be opened from outside, and no evidence to show how the fire started).  As in Osvaldo and Richardson, the evidence in this case was circumstantial in nature.  Inferences can, of course, properly be drawn from circumstantial evidence.  Each case necessarily turns on its own facts, and evidence of opportunity, for example, may be stronger in one case than in another.  The question is whether, viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to St. Paul and giving it the benefit of every legitimate inference, reasonable jurors nonetheless could have come to but one conclusion, a conclusion adverse to St. Paul.  We conclude that reasonable jurors could determine that F &amp; D deliberately set fire to the TWO FRIENDS in order to fraudulently obtain the proceeds of the insurance policy.  Therefore, we reverse the directed verdict in favor of F &amp; D.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p>C.

Gen. Laws. ch.  176D, &#167; 3(9)(d).  F &amp; D does not assert that St. Paul failed to conduct a reasonable investigation before denying its claim, but rather bases its unfair practices claim solely upon St. Paul's failure to pay under the Hull policy when, after its investigation was completed, liability under the policy was \"reasonably clear.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F &amp; D has failed to point to sufficient evidence supporting its unfair practices claim to avoid summary judgment.

We have concluded that those opinions, along with the other evidence supporting St. Paul's arson-by-the-insured defense, entitle St. Paul to present the liability issue to the jury.  Under these circumstances, it cannot be said that liability is \"reasonably clear,\" even at this stage of the proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a>  Insurers are both encouraged and entitled to rely, as St. Paul did here, on the advice of expert consultants in evaluating liability.

As said, to sustain its arson defense, St. Paul must prove that an agent or servant of F &amp; D burned the vessel.  \"Corporate assent to arson may be proved by circumstantial evidence, and the scope of admissible relevant evidence is necessarily broad.\"  Id.  See also Cora Pub, Inc. v. Continental Casualty Co., 619 F.2d 482, 486 (5th Cir.1980) (proof of corporate assent \"is not likely to be found in the archives of the corporation\").  The jury is entitled to consider the fact that F &amp; D was a closely-held corporation controlled by only a few family members.  See Mississippi Lofts, 841 F.2d at 253 (\"Several courts have permitted a jury to find from circumstantial evidence that an arsonist acted at the request or with the assent of an insured corporation, especially where the corporation is closely-held and where principal officers or stockholders are implicated in the act.\").

Ferrara &amp; DiMercurio, Inc.  (\"F &amp; D\"), the owner of the vessel, sought to recover insurance under a Hull policy issued by St. Paul Mercury Insurance Company (\"St.Paul\").  St. Paul refused to pay, on the alternative grounds that either a third party had burned the vessel, an event that, in St. Paul's view, was expressly excluded from policy coverage, or else F &amp; D had committed fraud by intentionally burning its own vessel.  F &amp; D brought this action in the district court, under the diversity jurisdiction, claiming that St. Paul's refusal to pay was a breach of the insurance contract and constituted \"bad faith\" in violation of Massachusetts consumer protection laws (Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A).  Prior to trial, the district court ruled that the Hull policy covered losses caused by fires intentionally set by third parties.  After St. Paul presented its arson-by-the-insured defense at trial, the district court granted judgment as a matter of law for F &amp; D. The Chapter 93A claim was subsequently dismissed on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, St. Paul contends that the district court erred in ruling that losses caused by fires intentionally set by third parties are covered under the Hull policy.  St. Paul also appeals from the district court's grant of F &amp; D's motion for judgment as a matter of law.  F &amp; D cross-appeals from the district court's grant of St. Paul's motion for summary judgment on F &amp; D's Chapter 93A claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  For the reasons that follow, we reverse the district court's ruling that the Hull policy covers losses caused by third-party arson and reverse the directed verdict granted in favor of F &amp; D. We affirm the dismissal of the Chapter 93A claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F &amp; D was a closely-held, family corporation engaged in the commercial fishing trade.  The corporation had four officers:  Leonardo Ferrara, Sr., Vito Ferrara, Ambrose Ferrara, and Francesco DiMercurio.  Six individuals, all family members, owned shares in the company:  Leonardo Ferrara, Sr., Vito Ferrara, Ambrose Ferrara, Francesco DiMercurio, Vincenza Ferrara, and Enza DiMercurio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, F &amp; D purchased the commercial fishing vessel F/V TWO FRIENDS for $375,000 with the proceeds of a loan from the Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company.  As a condition of the loan, members of the Ferrara family agreed to act as personal guarantors of F &amp; D's note.  In addition, Vincenza Ferrara and Francesco DiMercurio pledged their homes as additional security.  The TWO FRIENDS was the sole physical asset owned by F &amp; D. It was insured for $350,000 under a Marine Hull and Machinery policy issued to F &amp; D in 1992 by St. Paul.  The Hull policy that was issued by St. Paul was an American Institute AHAB Form policy, revised as of July 1, 1962.  The TWO FRIENDS was also insured for $350,000 under a War Risk policy issued to F &amp; D by Underwriters at Lloyd's, London.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> James Carey, St. Paul's accounting and financial expert, testified that F &amp; D had operated at a loss from the moment of its formation.  Carey testified that F &amp; D had considerable difficulty in making timely loan payments to Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company.  Because F &amp; D was habitually late in making its payments, the bank made demand in July, 1991, for payment in full of the outstanding loan, an amount in excess of $290,000.  In November 1991, the bank made demand upon the personal guarantors of F &amp; D's note for payment in full of the outstanding loan.  Also in November 1991, the bank filed a lawsuit to foreclose on the residence of Vincenza Ferrara.  After a period of negotiation, the bank, F &amp; D, and the personal guarantors reached an agreement in January 1992, whereby the bank would forebear from proceeding to judgment in the foreclosure action so long as $15,000 was paid to the bank and monthly payments were kept current thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the January 1992 agreement, Carey testified that F &amp; D continued to have difficulty making timely payments to the bank.  At a meeting in April 1993, F &amp; D and representatives of Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company agreed that F &amp; D would attempt to sell the TWO FRIENDS for $225,000.  On April 15, 1993, F &amp; D entered into an exclusive brokerage agreement with Ahern Marine Agency, Inc. in an effort to sell the TWO FRIENDS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 2, 1993, the TWO FRIENDS returned to Gloucester from a five-day fishing trip with Leo Ferrara, Jr. and three crew members aboard.  Leo Ferrara, Jr., the ship's engineer, testified that he left the TWO FRIENDS at approximately 4:30 p.m., and that he was the last crew member to leave the vessel.  He further testified that prior to leaving the vessel, he had locked all of the doors both upstairs and downstairs.  He testified that the only way to gain access to the TWO FRIENDS once these doors were locked was through the door on the crew quarters level, which he had secured with a padlock.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 3, 1993, at approximately 2:30 a.m., the TWO FRIENDS caught fire while tied to her berth at the Frontiero Brothers, Inc. wharf.  When the Gloucester Fire Department arrived, firefighters discovered that the only door through which they could gain entry to the TWO FRIENDS was located on the crew quarters level and was padlocked.  The firefighters cut the padlock in order to enter.  The Gloucester Fire Department's preliminary report, which was prepared on July 4, 1993, indicated that the cause of the fire was electrical in nature, but the origin uncertain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Leo Ferrara, Jr. and Vito Ferrara both testified that at the time of the fire, there were only four keys to the padlock used to secure the door on the crew quarters level. One of the keys was in the possession of Leonardo Ferrara, Sr., the president of F &amp; D, one was in the possession of his son, Vito Ferrara, the vice-president of the corporation, one was in the possession of Leo Ferrara, Jr., and the final key was hanging, along with the keys to other vessels, inside a warehouse on the Frontiero Brothers, Inc. wharf.  Pasquale Frontiero, the owner of the wharf, testified that on the night of the fire he had locked the warehouse prior to going home for the evening.  He testified that a few days after the fire, he noticed that the key to the TWO FRIENDS was still hanging in its usual location inside the warehouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving notification of the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS, St. Paul retained Fred O'Donnell, a fire scene analyst, and John Malcolm, a forensic electrical fire consultant, to investigate the cause and origin of the fire.  O'Donnell and Malcolm first visited the fire scene on July 8, 1993.  They were accompanied by David DuBois, a marine surveyor who had also been retained by St. Paul.  On this initial visit, Malcolm, DuBois, and O'Donnell conducted a visual inspection of the TWO FRIENDS and O'Donnell took samples from the crew quarters and galley areas to determine whether an accelerant was present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malcolm and O'Donnell returned to the vessel on August 3, 1993, to obtain the electrical panels, ostensibly for inspection and possible subrogation claims.  At the request of counsel for St. Paul, but without obtaining authorization from F &amp; D, O'Donnell and Malcolm removed the electrical panels from the TWO FRIENDS.  The panels were placed in an evidence storage locker at Malcolm's laboratory and were provided to counsel for F &amp; D upon his request.  O'Donnell testified that based upon his examination of burn patterns, he was able to identify points of origin for at least three, and possibly four, separate fires aboard the TWO FRIENDS.  He testified that one point of origin was located adjacent to a bunk in the port side crew quarters bunkroom, and another point of origin was located one deck below the crew quarters in the engine room at an electrical panel on the forward starboard side bulkhead.  O'Donnell testified that a third point of origin was also located in the engine room, on the port side next to the main hydraulic tank.  Finally, O'Donnell testified that there was an area of \"heavy burn\" in the galley area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Donnell testified that two of the three samples he had taken from the crew's quarters contained traces of diesel fuel, but that none of the samples taken from the galley area contained evidence of an accelerant.  He further testified that, in his opinion, the fire on the port side of the engine room was set by someone placing a container filled with accelerant in the forward port corner of the engine room next to the hydraulic tank hoses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malcolm investigated the vessel's electrical system to determine whether it played any part in the fire.  He testified that based upon his interview of Leo Ferrara, Jr. on July 8, 1993, it did not appear that the TWO FRIENDS had experienced any electrical difficulties on the July 2, 1993 fishing trip.  Malcolm testified that he found no evidence that the electrical system had played any role in the fires in the bunkroom or in the fire that originated in the engine room on the port side.  He testified, however, that he did find evidence of the escape of electricity, or \"arcing,\" in the electrical panel on the forward starboard side bulkhead in the engine room.  Malcolm testified that, based upon his examination of the vessel's electrical system, it was his opinion that the fire in the electrical panel in the engine room was the first fire to ignite on July 3, 1993.  Malcolm also concluded in his written report, drafted on July 22, 1993, and testified at trial that the burn patterns in the area of the electrical panel were consistent with an accidental electrical fire.  He specifically noted in his report and testified that it was possible for persons to intentionally set up the burning of an electrical panel to make the fire appear accidental, but that he had discovered no electrical evidence that this had occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Donnell and Malcolm both testified that there was no evidence of \"communication,\" or connection, between either of the two fires in the engine room and the fires in the crew quarters or between the two fires in the engine room.  Based upon the arcing in the engine room electrical panel and the absence of arcing elsewhere in the ship's electrical system, Malcolm concluded that the fire in the crew quarters could not have ignited the fire in the electrical panel in the engine room.  Malcolm and O'Donnell both concluded that the fire at the electrical panel was not the source of the fire in the crew quarters, as there was no evidence that the electrical panel fire had spread upward from the panel.  Based upon his examination of the burn patterns on the engine room floor boards, O'Donnell concluded that the fire in the electrical panel on the starboard side of the engine room did not cause the fire on the port side of the engine room next to the hydraulic tank.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Given the absence of evidence of communication among the various fires originating at different locations on the vessel, as well as the evidence that an accelerant was present in the crew quarters and on the port side of the engine room, O'Donnell testified that, in his opinion, the fires aboard the TWO FRIENDS had been deliberately set by someone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carey, the accounting expert, testified that at the time of the fire, F &amp; D owed a total of $426,000 to various creditors.  He further testified that to meet its financial obligations at the time of the fire, F &amp; D would have had to generate revenues from its fishing operation of approximately $380,000 per year.  Carey testified that F &amp; D had never been that profitable in all its years of operation.  Carey also testified that had the July 3, 1993 fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS resulted in a total loss of the vessel, and had St. Paul paid the full proceeds of the Hull policy, F &amp; D would have gained $350,000 to be applied to its debts.  Carey stated that as a loss payee under the policy, the Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company would have had its note paid in full, and that this payment would have extinguished the personal liability of the guarantors of the note and avoided the loss of the personal guarantors' homes.  By contrast, Carey testified that had the vessel been sold for $225,000, the bank loans would not have been paid in full, the personal liability of the guarantors would not have been extinguished, and the homes of the personal guarantors would have remained in jeopardy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before trial, St. Paul requested a ruling of law that losses caused by arson committed by a party other than the insured were not covered under the Hull policy.  The \"Perils\" clause of the Hull policy under which the TWO FRIENDS was insured listed \"Fire\" as a covered peril.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  St. Paul argued, however, that only fires that are \"fortuitous\" and \"of the Sea\" are covered under the Perils clause, and that the fire in this case met neither requirement.  St. Paul argued, in the alternative, that the Strikes, Riots, and Civil Commotions(\"SR &amp; CC\") clause excluded arson by third parties from coverage under the Hull policy.  The SR &amp; CC clause stated:  \"Warranted free of loss, damage or expense in consequence of strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, civil commotion, riots, martial law, military or usurped power or malicious acts.\"  (emphasis supplied).  The district court ruled that all fires, with the exception of those intentionally set by the insured, were insured under the Perils clause.  The court further ruled that although arson by a third party was a \"malicious act,\" the SR &amp; CC clause did not exclude from coverage losses caused by fires intentionally set by third parties unless the arson was somehow \"connected with\" a strike, lockout, political or labor disturbance, riot, or some other event set forth in the SR &amp; CC clause.  As the arson alleged by St. Paul did not fit within any of these categories, the district court ruled that the Hull policy provided coverage for losses caused as a result of the burning of the TWO FRIENDS by a third party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Denied the opportunity to defend on the further ground that the vessel had been intentionally burned by unknown third parties, St. Paul concentrated at trial on the defense of arson-by-the-insured.  In order to prevail on this defense, Massachusetts law required that St. Paul prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that (1) the fire was incendiary in nature;  (2) F &amp; D had a motive to set the fire;  and (3) F &amp; D or its agents had an opportunity to set the fire.  See infra.   St. Paul presented the evidence recounted above, including its experts' opinions that multiple fires were deliberately set aboard the TWO FRIENDS, the evidence concerning the financial difficulties encountered by F &amp; D prior to the fire, and the limited availability of keys to the locked vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After St. Paul presented its arson defense,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> F &amp; D moved for judgment as a matter of law.  The district court denied the motion and ruled that whether St. Paul had proved its arson defense was \"a question for the jury.\"   However, shortly after F &amp; D had begun to put on its rebuttal case, the district court reconsidered its prior ruling and directed a verdict in favor of F &amp; D. While the court considered it \"a very close question,\" it concluded that the circumstantial evidence presented by St. Paul was not sufficient to allow a jury to return a verdict in its favor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the court allowed the parties to undertake additional discovery on F &amp; D's claim that St. Paul's refusal to settle under the Hull policy constituted an unfair or deceptive business practice under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A. During this additional discovery period, St. Paul produced, for the first time, a report that had been prepared by its marine surveyor, David DuBois, on July 9, 1993, in which DuBois concurred with the preliminary conclusion of the Gloucester Fire Department that the fire on July 3, 1993, was electrical in nature.  The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on F &amp; D's Chapter 93A claim.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of St. Paul.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the district court erred in ruling that losses caused by fires intentionally set by third parties were not excluded by the SR &amp; CC clause from coverage under the Hull policy.  We reverse the directed verdict granted in favor of F &amp; D on the breach of contract claim, but affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of St. Paul on the Chapter 93A claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.

Black, The Law of Admiralty, &#167; 2-9, p. 72 (2d ed.1975) (perils \"of the sea\" are \"fortuitous losses occurring through extraordinary action of the elements at sea, or any accident or mishap in navigation\").  St. Paul misreads the Perils clause.  See n. 6, supra.  \"Fire\" is specified as a covered peril in itself, separate and apart from the perils \"of the sea.\"   See Rosa v.

Indeed, St. Paul consistently disavowed such an interpretation below, contending instead that coverage was not available under the Hull policy because the loss had been caused by the intentional burning of the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Paul's focus on the Perils clause is misplaced, as F &amp; D carried its burden of proving that accidental fires fall within the grant of coverage under the Perils clause.  The burden shifted to St. Paul to demonstrate that a fire set deliberately by a third party was, as the Perils clause states, \"excluded by provisions elsewhere in the Policy or by endorsement.\"   St. Paul asserts that the SR &amp; CC clause, which excludes from coverage \"loss, damage or expense in consequence of strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, civil commotion, riots, martial law, military or usurped power or malicious acts,\" excludes losses caused by third-party arson.  The district court, however, construed the SR &amp; CC clause narrowly as excluding only losses caused by malicious acts that are performed within the context of \"strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, civil commotion, riots, martial law, military or usurped power.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">F &amp; D concedes that arson by a third party constitutes a \"malicious act.\"   F &amp; D urges us, however, to affirm the district court's constricted reading of the SR &amp; CC clause.  Like the district court, we have found little guidance in the case law as to the proper construction of the language at issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  The parties rely primarily upon the decision of the district court in O'DonnellUsen Fisheries v.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span> (D.Mass.1987).  In Bathurst, the F/V Ann C. Spencer was destroyed by fire.  A party unrelated to the insured was charged with arson of the vessel, but later acquitted.  The insurer argued that arson by a third party was not covered by the insurance policy.  The district court examined in some detail the interplay between marine Hull policies, such as the one at issue here, and War Risk policies.  The latter, as the court pointed out, provide coverage for those risks precluded from coverage under Hull clauses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  In Bathurst, the insured, unlike F &amp; D, did not have a Hull policy.  Nevertheless, the district court read the applicable War Risk policy to provide coverage for only those risks that a Hull policy would have covered but for the preclusion from coverage under its War, Strikes and Related Exclusions (\"WSRE\") clause.  The court utilized the WSRE clause from the 1970 version of the American Institute Hull Clauses (\"AIHC\") form, which excluded from coverage any losses caused by, inter alia, \"malicious acts or vandalism.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The insured conceded that arson was a \"malicious act or vandalism.\"   Thus, the court concluded that \"when malicious acts or vandalism occur in the form of arson the loss is precluded from coverage by the [WRSE clause].\"  Id. at 41.   Since the WRSE clause of the Hull policy excluded coverage for losses caused by arson perpetrated by a third party, the court held that the War Risk policy provided coverage for such losses.  See id. at 42.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">St. Paul argues that Bathurst supports its claim that arson by a third party is excluded under the SR &amp; CC clause, while F &amp; D asserts that Bathurst is distinguishable, as the court was interpreting a different insurance form than was used to insure the TWO FRIENDS.  The district court agreed with F &amp; D and distinguished Bathurst on the ground that the SR &amp; CC clause in the St. Paul policy was \"narrower\" than the WRSE clause construed by the court in Bathurst.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no important distinction, however, between the language used in the 1962 AHAB Form used by St. Paul and the 1970 AIHC Form construed by the district court in Bathurst.   The language used in the two policy forms is nearly identical.  Both clauses exclude coverage for losses caused by, inter alia, \"malicious acts,\" and both list \"malicious acts\" after a succession of others of different generic types.  We are, of course, not bound by Bathurst.   However, we believe that the Bathurst court's interpretation of \"malicious acts or vandalism\" in the WRSE clause, without any contextual limitation of the type found by the district court here, was sound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, we do not believe that the district court's instant construction of the SR &amp; CC clause was correct.  \"Malicious acts\" is set forth in the SR &amp; CC clause as a separate, unmodified exclusion from coverage.  To be sure, it appears in a clause labeled, \"Strikes, Riots, and Civil Commotions,\" and is preceded by other events certain of which fit generically under that label.  But nothing in the plain language and grammar of the clause supports the district court's constriction of excludable \"malicious acts\" to only those acts perpetrated within the context of one or more of the other co-listed events.  Nor, in our view, would an objectively reasonable insured interpret the \"malicious acts\" exclusion so narrowly.  Like the insured in Bathurst, F &amp; D concedes, as it must, that arson by a third party is a \"malicious act.\"   Accordingly, losses caused by third-party arson are excluded under the SR &amp; CC clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add that restricting \"malicious acts\" to only those malicious acts that also fall under the previously-listed generic categories of strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, etc. would render the \"malicious acts\" language superfluous.  For this reason, it would be inappropriate to apply the ejusdem generis canon of construction, under which general words following specific ones are sometimes limited to the formers' objects.  The Supreme Court has said that the ejusdem generis canon \"cannot be employed to render general words meaningless.\"  United States v. Alpers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104761\"><a href=\"/opinion/104761/united-states-v-alpers/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">680</span></a></span>, 682, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104761\"><a href=\"/opinion/104761/united-states-v-alpers/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In the SR &amp; CC clause, losses \"in consequence of strikes, lockouts, political or labor disturbances, civil commotion, riots, martial law, military or usurped power\" are already excluded from policy coverage.  That exclusion obviously applies to malicious as well as to other acts within the described generic categories.  Hence to limit the phrase, \"malicious acts,\" to just those activities related to the former categories would be to render the \"malicious acts\" provision redundant, an interpretation running counter to the customary assumption that all the words within a clause serve some purpose.

Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#167; 46.06.  Only by reading \"malicious acts\" as including malicious actions beyond those associated with the earlier categories does the phraseology add in a meaningful fashion to what has already been said.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the malicious acts in question are arson--and not, as a practical matter, arson by the owner or its agents, which are actions separately excluded from coverage by law, but the rarer acts of fire-setting by vandals or other malicious individuals.  Such acts fall within the general category of intentional third-party violence which can be said to be a principal overall theme of the SR &amp; CC clause.  The \"malicious acts\" category serves the relevant purpose of excluding destructive acts \"not public or tumultuous enough to be considered a riot or civil commotion.\"   Harry L.

Shortly after F &amp; D began to present its rebuttal case, the district court ruled from the bench that St. Paul had failed to adduce sufficient evidence of arson by the insured to reach the jury.

More specifically, Massachusetts law requires that a party interposing an arson-by-the-insured defense prove the following elements by a preponderance of the evidence:  (1) that the fire was incendiary (deliberately set);  (2) that opportunity existed for servants or agents of the insured to set the fire;  and (3) that the insured had a motive to set the fire.  See, e.g., Osvaldo Varane, Inc. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></span>, 865, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></span> (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled that St. Paul had failed to carry its burden as to each of the above elements and, thus, could not reach the jury on its arson-by-the-insured defense.  With regard to motive, the district court concluded that since the benefit of the insurance proceeds would have gone to Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company and F &amp; D's creditors in the first instance, F &amp; D had no economic motive to burn the TWO FRIENDS.  Indeed, the court concluded that F &amp; D had strong reason not to burn the TWO FRIENDS.  The court stated:  \"Where was the advantage to the corporation or to the individuals of the family who owned it, in the destruction of their means of livelihood?\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to opportunity, the court noted that the last agent of F &amp; D to be near the TWO FRIENDS was Leo Ferrara, Jr., who left the vessel approximately 11 hours before the fire started.  The court concluded that since St. Paul's witnesses could not place any agent or servant of F &amp; D near the TWO FRIENDS closer in time to the fire, the evidence of opportunity was too weak to go to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court rejected as untenable St. Paul's theory of incendiarism.  The court noted that both Malcolm and O'Donnell had testified that the fire located at the electrical panel in the engine room had ignited first.  Even assuming that the electrical panel fire had been deliberately set, the court concluded that it \"simply does not make sense\" that a person would set that fire and then proceed, at considerable danger to his own safety, to ignite fires in other areas of the boat.  Indeed, the court described this as an \"odd way to burn a boat.\"   The \"bottom line on liability,\" in the court's view, was that St. Paul's incendiarism theory required some evidence that the fire had been pre-arranged or planned.  As St. Paul did not present such evidence, the court concluded that it was \"too big a leap\" for a reasonable jury to find that F &amp; D had deliberately burned the TWO FRIENDS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not disagree with the district court that the arson-by-the-insured defense gives rise to close and difficult factual questions.  Nevertheless, after careful review of the entire record, we conclude that the district court erred in withdrawing the arson defense from the jury and directing a verdict in favor of F &amp; D. St. Paul presented sufficient circumstantial evidence as to each of the required elements of its arson defense to reach the jury.  The circumstantial evidence of motive was strong.  While it is true that the Ferrara family would not have pocketed the proceeds of the St. Paul policy directly, Carey testified that a complete loss of the TWO FRIENDS would have resulted in a payment of $350,000, a substantial portion of which would have gone to extinguish the debt to the Gloucester Bank &amp; Trust Company.  Carey also testified that this payment would have saved the personal guarantors' homes, which had been pledged as additional security to the bank.  Further, there was substantial evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that F &amp; D had never been a profitable venture, and, given its considerable debt obligations, was in dire straits financially at the time of the fire.  This was sufficient evidence of motive to reach the jury.  See Osvaldo, 362 Mass. at 865, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></span> (insured's business experiencing financial difficulties, payments to mortgagees in arrears, accounts payable far exceeded accounts receivable, and home had suffered foreclosure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence with regard to opportunity was somewhat weaker.  The court found it significant that no servant or agent of F &amp; D had been seen near the TWO FRIENDS at or near the time of the fire.  Such direct evidence is not required to present an arson defense to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>  There was undisputed testimony that there were only four keys to the TWO FRIENDS, three of which were in the possession of agents of F &amp; D, the other being in the possession of the wharf owner.  The evidence that access to the vessel was limited and that the Gloucester Fire Department had to force entry when it arrived on the scene may have led the jury, if permitted to consider it, to find that the arsonist had a key.  See Richardson v. Travelers' Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">391</span></span>, 396, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></span> (1934) (evidence warranted finding that insured alone had key which would permit person to enter house and leave it locked up as it was when firemen arrived);  see also Gregory's Continental Coiffures &amp; Boutique, Inc. v.

It is true that if one fully accepts the testimony of Malcolm and O'Donnell that the fire at the electrical panel in the engine room ignited first, the timing of the fires appears somewhat \"odd.\"   We do not believe, however, that this was sufficient reason to withdraw the arson defense from the jury.  The jury, not the judge, is the fact-finder.  The incendiarism element of an arson defense does not require that the insurer prove the arsonist chose the most logical or safest method for setting a fire, or that the fire was carefully planned or pre-arranged by members of the corporation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It does not matter that the trial judge drew a different inference or conclusion from the evidence presented or \"[felt] that other results [were] more reasonable.\"  Boston &amp; M.R.R. v.

It was for the jury to weigh the testimony of Malcolm and O'Donnell and all the other evidence in order to determine whether the fire aboard the TWO FRIENDS was deliberately set.  Malcolm and O'Donnell both testified that at least three, and possibly four, separate fires had been set, and that there was no evidence of \"communication\" between them.  O'Donnell testified that some of the samples taken from the vessel showed traces of diesel fuel and that, in his opinion, the fire located on the port side of the engine room had been set by someone placing a container filled with accelerant in the forward port corner of the engine room next to the hydraulic tank hoses.  We cannot say that a jury presented with this evidence lacked sufficient basis from which to conclude that multiple fires were deliberately set aboard the TWO FRIENDS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court stated that it was aware of no case \"where the evidence of fraud is, or arson, is as thin and slender as it is in this case.\"   However, the evidence of arson presented by St. Paul was similar in both substance and character to other evidence found sufficient under Massachusetts case law to sustain an arson defense.  See Osvaldo, 362 Mass. at 864-65, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">923</span></span> (expert evidence indicated presence of accelerant, insured's business experiencing financial difficulties, and insured seen near premises approximately one hour prior to fire);  see also Richardson, 288 Mass. at 396-97, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">193</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></span> (fire incendiary in origin, doors and windows locked when firemen arrived, and insured was \"in need of money\"), cf.

As in Osvaldo and Richardson, the evidence in this case was circumstantial in nature.  Inferences can, of course, properly be drawn from circumstantial evidence.  Each case necessarily turns on its own facts, and evidence of opportunity, for example, may be stronger in one case than in another.  The question is whether, viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to St. Paul and giving it the benefit of every legitimate inference, reasonable jurors nonetheless could have come to but one conclusion, a conclusion adverse to St. Paul.  We conclude that reasonable jurors could determine that F &amp; D deliberately set fire to the TWO FRIENDS in order to fraudulently obtain the proceeds of the insurance policy.
