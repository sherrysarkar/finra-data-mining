CHEMICALS AMERICA, INC.,\r\n\n               Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n   APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n          FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n  [Hon. Daniel R. Dominguez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                      Before\r\n\n               Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n            Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\nand DiClerico, District Judge.\r\n\nHarry Anduze-Montano, with whom Andres Guillemard-Noble and\r\nNachman, Santiago &amp; Guillemard were on brief for appellant.\r\nJohn F. Malley III, with whom McConnell Valdes was on brief for\r\nappellee.\r\n\n               June 11, 1998\r\n\n                                           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.  Able International Corp.\r\nbrought the present action for damages in the United States\r\nDistrict Court for the District of Puerto Rico claiming that B.P.\r\nChemicals America, Inc. (\"BP\") violated Act No. 21 of December 5,\r\n1990, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10,  279-279h (hereinafter \"Law 21\"),\r\nby terminating Able as its exclusive sales agent for barex resins\r\nin the Caribbean area.  BP moved to dismiss on the ground that Law\r\n21 is inapplicable to sales representation agreements formed prior\r\nto December 6, 1990.  See id.\r\nAble then submitted an amended complaint incorporating\r\nvarious documents  generated by BP in 1991, after Law 21 took\r\neffect  relating to two orders for barex resins which Able\r\nobtained from Rovipack International while the latter was experi\r\nencing acute financial problems.  Able maintained that the\r\namendatory documents evinced a tacit \"extinctive novation\" of the\r\n1988 sales representation agreement by shifting from BP to Able the\r\nfinancial risk entailed in releasing the two barex resin shipments\r\nto Rovipack in 1991.  As a result, Able argued, the substituted\r\nsales representation agreement entered into in 1991 became subject\r\nto Law 21.\r\nA magistrate judge converted the motion to dismiss and\r\nrecommended summary judgment for BP, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c), on\r\nthe ground that the amendatory documents demonstrated, at most, an\r\nintention to vary the 1988 sales representation agreement (i) in\r\nregard to only two barex resin shipments and (ii) solely in\r\nresponse to Rovipack's acute financial problems.  The district\r\ncourt entered summary judgment for BP and Able appealed.\r\n\n                      I\r\n\n                  DISCUSSION\r\n\nIt was up to Able to proffer sufficient competent\r\nevidence to generate a trialworthy issue on its novation claim. \r\nSee Union Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 793 F.2d 1, 13 (1stCir. 1986) (novation is an affirmative defense within scope of Fed.\r\nR. Civ. P. 8(c)); see also Nieves Domenech v. Dymax Corp., 952 F.\r\nSupp. 57, 62-64 (D.P.R. 1996) (discussing \"extinctive novation\"\r\nclaim under Puerto Rico law).  Accordingly, we must inquire, denovo, see Doyle v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., No. 97-1275, slip op.\r\nat 2 (1st Cir. June 2, 1998), whether the evidence proffered by Able\r\nwould permit a rational trier of fact to find that the revised\r\nfinancial terms governing BP's acceptance of the two purchase\r\norders Able obtained from Rovipack after the enactment of Law 21\r\nwere \"'absolutely incompatible'\" with the original 1988 sales\r\nrepresentation agreement, FDIC v. P.L.M. Int'l, Inc., 834 F.2d 248,\r\n251 (1st Cir. 1987) (quoting Francisco Garraton, Inc. v. Lanman &amp;\r\nKemp-Barclay &amp; Co., 559 F. Supp. 405, 407 (D.P.R. 1983)), thereby\r\ngiving rise to a tacit extinctive novation governed by Law 21. \r\nLike the district court, we conclude that Able failed to meet its\r\nburden of production in opposition to summary judgment.\r\nFor one thing, Able merely maintained that Rovipack was\r\nits \"main\" barex resin customer in Puerto Rico, but proffered no\r\ncompetent evidence that Rovipack was its only customer, either in\r\nPuerto Rico or elsewhere in the Caribbean.  Moreover, at oral\r\nargument on appeal Able attempted instead to foist upon BP the\r\nresponsibility for proffering evidence that Able had developed\r\nother barex resin customers for BP.  As we have seen, however, it\r\nwas for Able to proffer the evidence required to generate a\r\ntrialworthy issue on its novation claim.  See Union Mut. Life Ins.\r\nCo., 793 F.2d at 13.\r\nNor were these evidentiary omissions mere procedural\r\nlapses, particularly since the 1988 sales representation agreement\r\nexplicitly obligated Able \"to use its best efforts to promote the\r\nsales of and solicit orders for [barex resins] and otherwise\r\nprovide sales coverage satisfactory to [BP] in the Caribbean\r\nIslands (excepting Cuba) and Surinam.\"  Agreement at  4(a). \r\nRather, these omissions precluded any trialworthy showing that the\r\namendatory documents generated by BP in 1991  requiring Able to\r\npay BP in advance for the two barex resin orders thereafter\r\nobtained from Rovipack  were \"'absolutely incompatible'\" with the\r\n1988 sales representation agreement, see P.L.M. Int'l, Inc., 834\r\nF.2d at 251, since the revised terms (i) in no way affected orders\r\nfrom any other barex resin customers  existing or prospective \r\nwhich Able developed for BP under their exclusive agency agreement\r\nand (ii) left the 1988 sales representation agreement wholly intact\r\nin all other respects even as regards orders obtained from\r\nRovipack.  Rather than evincing a mutual intention to enter into a\r\nnew contractual relationship \"completely incompatible\" with the 1988\r\nsales representation agreement, the amendatory documents issued by\r\nBP in 1991 relating to orders from Rovipack plainly affirmed andfacilitated the continuation of BP's exclusive sales agency\r\nagreement with Able, without in any way disturbing its original\r\nterms in relation to other barex resin customers theretofore or\r\nthereafter obtained by Able.  Accordingly, we cannot conclude that\r\nAble succeeded in generating a trialworthy claim that these\r\namendatory documents worked \"'such a radical change . . . when\r\ncompared with the [original agreement] as to make them mutually\r\n[exclusive] and unable to coexist.'\"  Id. at 251 (quoting Francisco\r\nGarraton, Inc., 559 F. Supp. at 407).\r\n\n                      II\r\n\n                  CONCLUSION\r\n\nAs the parties acknowledge that Law 21 does not apply\r\nretroactively to their 1988 sales representation agreement, and\r\nsince Able failed to generate a trialworthy issue relating to its\r\nextinctive novation claim, the district court judgment must beaffirmed; costs to appellee.\r\nSO ORDERED.\n",

Rather than evincing a mutual intention to enter into a new contractual relationship \"completely incompatible\" with the 1988 sales representation agreement, the amendatory documents issued by BP in 1991 relating to orders from Rovipack plainly affirmed and facilitated the continuation of BP's exclusive sales agency agreement with Able, without in any way disturbing its original terms in relation to other barex resin customers theretofore or thereafter obtained by Able.  Accordingly, we cannot conclude that Able succeeded in generating a trialworthy claim that these amendatory documents worked \" 'such a radical change ... when compared with the [original agreement] as to make them mutually [exclusive] and unable to coexist.' \"  Id. at 251 (quoting Francisco Garraton, Inc., 559 F.Supp. at 407).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the parties acknowledge that Law 21 does not apply retroactively to their 1988 sales representation agreement, and since Able failed to generate a trialworthy issue relating to its extinctive novation claim, the district court judgment must be affirmed;  costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Able unhelpfully maintained below that despite an explicit provision in the 1988 sales representation agreement requiring the application of Ohio law, Puerto Rico law should govern if the court were to conclude that no novation had occurred.  As this reasoning conspicuously presumed that Able's novation claim would fare no differently under the law of either jurisdiction, and we have verified as much, see, e.g., Federal Land Bank v.
