Unquestionably, tobacco is\n\nsubject to heavy regulation by federal and state governments. This\n\ncase concerns one attempt, by Massachusetts, to further regulate\n\ntobacco products by requiring tobacco companies to submit to\n\nMassachusetts the ingredient lists for all cigarettes, snuffs, and\n\nchewing    tobaccos    sold   in     the   state.          For    each    brand,    the\n\nmanufacturer must list, by relative amount, all ingredients besides\n\ntobacco, water, or reconstituted tobacco sheet.                    Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 94, § 307B (2002).             Currently, the appellees, a group of\n\ntobacco companies, treat these ingredient lists as trade secrets\n\nand either do not disclose brand-specific information at all or do\n\nnot disclose it without some guarantee of confidentiality.\n\n            The tobacco companies brought suit claiming that the\n\nMassachusetts statute, which allows the public disclosure of these\n\ningredient lists whenever such disclosure \"could reduce risks to\n\npublic    health,\"    Mass.   Gen.    Laws    ch.    94,    §    307B,    creates    an\n\nunconstitutional      taking.         Appellees      also        argued    that     the\n\nMassachusetts    statute      violates       their   Due        Process   rights     by\n\neffecting a taking of their property without first providing a\n\nmeaningful opportunity to be heard.            The district court concurred\n\nand granted summary judgment in favor of the tobacco companies.\n\nA divided panel of this Court rejected appellees' arguments and\n\nreversed the district court's judgment.                After en banc review,\n\nhowever, Judge Selya and I agree with the district court and,\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ftherefore, affirm its grant of summary judgment and award of\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief in favor of plaintiffs-appellees.\n\n                                        I.\n\n                              Factual Background\n\n            Appellees are various manufacturers of cigarettes and\n\nsmokeless    tobacco     products.1      They      all   currently   sell   their\n\nproducts in Massachusetts and are potentially subject to the\n\nrequirements of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, § 307B (\"Disclosure Act\").\n\n            Defendants-appellants        are       the   Attorney    General     of\n\nMassachusetts and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health.\n\nA.   The Ingredient Lists\n\n            All of the tobacco products manufactured by appellees\n\ninclude a variety of additives (in addition to tobacco, water, and\n\nreconstituted tobacco sheet).            For example, common ingredients\n\ninclude sugars, glycerin, propylene glycol, cocoa, and licorice.\n\nThese various additives are used as solvents, processing aids, pH\n\nmodifiers,         formulation   aids        for     reconstituted      tobacco,\n\npreservatives, humectants, tobacco protection aids, \"plasticizing\"\n\nagents,     and,    perhaps   most    importantly,       flavorings.        It   is\n\nundisputed that appellees have spent millions of dollars developing\n\n\n\n1\n   The cigarette manufacturers joined in this case are Philip\nMorris Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Brown & Williamson Tobacco\nCorp., and Lorillard Tobacco Co. The smokeless tobacco companies\nare U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Co., Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.,\nNational Tobacco Co., Pinkerton Tobacco Co., and Swisher\nInternational, Inc.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fformulas for their different brands, and when successful, those\n\nbrands are worth billions of dollars.             A major factor of each\n\nbrand's success is its distinctive flavor, taste, and aroma.\n\n          While appellants argue that the added ingredients are\n\nneither pre-approved by regulators nor tested for safety, it is\n\nundisputed that most of the added ingredients are approved for\n\nconsumption in food or \"Generally Recognized As Safe\" by the Food\n\nand Drug Administration. The one additive not found on either list\n\nis denatured alcohol, and this has been approved by the Bureau of\n\nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms for use in the manufacture of\n\ntobacco products.\n\n          Each    of   the    appellees     closely   guards   its   valuable\n\ningredient lists.      For example, within each company, only a few\n\nindividuals are privy to the entire formula for any one brand.\n\nSuppliers are subject to confidentiality agreements and ship their\n\nproducts in packages which disguise their contents.\n\n          It is true that some ingredients of particular brands are\n\nknown, and all ingredients used in any tobacco product are publicly\n\navailable.     However, this does not mean that complete brand-\n\nspecific ingredient information can be obtained.          In fact, various\n\nappellees have tried to \"reverse engineer\" the formulas of their\n\ncompetitors,     but    these    attempts      have    been    unsuccessful.\n\nApparently,    they    have   been   able    to   determine    the   chemical\n\ncomposition of the various brands, but this information does not\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ftranslate into a formula to recreate the product.                     Appellees\n\nassert, however, that if they were able to combine the chemical\n\ncomposition derived from this \"reverse engineering\" with a list of\n\nspecific ingredients, arranged by relative amount, it would be much\n\neasier to discover a competitor's formula.            Therefore, the tobacco\n\ncompanies    argue    that    publication      of   their   ingredient      lists,\n\norganized by relative amount, on a brand-by-brand basis would\n\nlikely destroy the secrecy of their formulas.               This contention is\n\nnot disputed by appellants.\n\nB.   Current Federal and State Disclosure Requirements\n\n            Tobacco    companies     currently      have    to   disclose   their\n\ningredient lists to both the federal government and at least two\n\nstate governments.\n\n            The federal government requires only that an aggregate\n\nlist of all ingredients used in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco\n\nproducts    be    provided   to    the   Department    of    Health   and    Human\n\nServices.        15 U.S.C. § 1335a(a).         These lists, each of which\n\ncontains hundreds of ingredients, neither identify the ingredients\n\nin any particular brand nor reveal which ingredients are used by\n\nwhich manufacturer.          Id.    The Department of Health and Human\n\nServices can study and report to Congress on the health effects of\n\ntobacco additives, including information on specific ingredients\n\nwhich may pose a health risk to consumers.                  Id. at § 1335a(b)\n\n(1)(A)-(B).       However, without further legislation and disclosure,\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fthe federal government has no ability to warn consumers of the use\n\nof harmful additives in specific brands.\n\n            Two    states,       besides     Massachusetts,     require     some\n\ndisclosure of additives to tobacco products.             Minnesota mandates\n\nthat tobacco companies report only the use of several targeted\n\nadditives in their products.          Minn. Stat. § 461.17 (Supp. 1997).\n\nTexas requires that the tobacco companies report brand-specific\n\ningredient information, in descending quantities.               Tex. Health &\n\nSafety Code Ann. §§ 161.351-55 (West Supp. 2001).                  While this\n\nscheme   superficially       looks   like    the   challenged   Massachusetts\n\nlegislation, Texas protects the ingredient lists by prohibiting\n\npublic disclosure when those lists would be considered trade\n\nsecrets under either federal or state law.             Id. at § 161.254(c).\n\nThe tobacco companies have complied and continue to comply with\n\nthese disclosure requirements and have never challenged their\n\nvalidity.\n\nC.   The Disclosure Act\n\n            In    1996,   Massachusetts      enacted   the    Disclosure    Act,\n\nostensibly to promote public health.           Citing the fact that various\n\ntobacco product additives may have adverse health effects when\n\nburned, either alone or in combination with other additives,\n\nMassachusetts expressed an interest in being able to study more\n\naccurately the health effects of tobacco products on consumers.\n\nMassachusetts      was    also   concerned    that   certain    additives    may\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fincrease nicotine delivery and that those additives might be used\n\nin cigarettes advertised as having a lower nicotine content.\n\n            In Massachusetts’ view, previous disclosure requirements\n\ndid not allow it to investigate adequately these public health\n\nconcerns.    For example, the publicly available ingredient lists do\n\nnot   identify    additives    according      to   brand    or    manufacturer.\n\nTherefore,    Massachusetts    could    not    study   the       interaction   of\n\nadditives and know whether those additives are actually combined.\n\nNor could Massachusetts study the additives used in more popular\n\nbrands and those brands targeted to younger consumers.                   No one\n\ndisputes that these suggested studies are laudable and within the\n\nhealth and safety realm of the state's traditional police powers.\n\n             Massachusetts, however, has an additional goal to be\n\nrealized through the Disclosure Act: it hopes to publicize the\n\ningredient     lists   of     various     brands.          This    information,\n\nMassachusetts believes, will help consumers make more informed\n\nchoices about the tobacco products they choose to consume.                     The\n\nenvisioned effect is greater public awareness about the potential\n\nhealth effects of tobacco additives.\n\n             With these considerations in mind, Massachusetts enacted\n\nthe Disclosure Act, which reads, in relevant part:\n\n             For the purpose of protecting the public\n             health, any manufacturer of cigarettes, snuff\n             or chewing tobacco sold in the commonwealth\n             shall provide the department of public health\n             with an annual report, in a form and at a time\n             specified by that department, which lists for\n\n                                    -8-\n\f          each brand of such product sold the following\n          information:\n\n                 (a) The    identity   of   any   added\n                 constituent other than tobacco, water\n                 or reconstituted tobacco sheet made\n                 wholly from tobacco, to be listed in\n                 descending order according to weight,\n                 measure, or numerical count; and\n\n          . . . [Any] information in the annual reports\n          with   respect    to   which    the   department\n          determines   that    there   is   a   reasonable\n          scientific basis for concluding that the\n          availability of such information could reduce\n          risks to public health, shall be public\n          records; provided, however, that before any\n          public disclosure of such information the\n          department shall request the advice of the\n          attorney general whether such disclosure would\n          constitute an unconstitutional taking of\n          property,   and    shall   not   disclose   such\n          information unless and until the attorney\n          general advises that such disclosure would not\n          constitute an unconstitutional taking.2\n\nMass. Gen. Laws § 307B (emphasis added). Therefore, the Disclosure\n\nAct establishes two threshold requirements before an ingredient\n\nlist \"shall\" be made public: (1) there must be a finding that\n\npublication \"could reduce risks to public health;\" and (2) the\n\nMassachusetts Attorney General must find that disclosure would not\n\nbe an unconstitutional taking.    Id.\n\n\n\n\n2\n    The Disclosure Act also requires the tobacco companies to\ndisclose the nicotine yield ratings for each brand. Mass. Gen.\nLaws § 307B. This information may also be made public, according\nto the same guidelines governing the disclosure of the ingredient\nlists. The tobacco companies have not challenged this element of\nthe Disclosure Act and, in fact, have been complying with it.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f              Some   further   requirements        have   been    established   by\n\nregulations enacted under the Disclosure Act.                    Mass. Regs. Code\n\ntit. 105, § 660.200.         These regulations require the Massachusetts\n\nDepartment of Public Health (\"DPH\") to provide sixty days' notice\n\nto    the    manufacturer    before   the      proposed   disclosure.      Id. at\n\n§ 660.200(E).        To prevent disclosure, the manufacturer may remove\n\nits product from Massachusetts or reformulate it. Id. at § 660.200\n\n(F).    An amendment to the regulations also allows the manufacturer\n\nto suspend disclosure by filing a lawsuit.                Id. at § 660.200(G).\n\nFinally, until all requirements of the Disclosure Act and its\n\nenabling regulations have been met, the regulations provide that\n\nthe    DPH    will    keep   the   tobacco      companies'    ingredient    lists\n\nconfidential.        Id. at § 660.200(G)(2).\n\n                                         II.\n\n                             Procedural Background\n\n              The various tobacco companies filed this action in 1996,\n\nshortly after the Disclosure Act was enacted.3                    Their complaint\n\nalleges that the Disclosure Act violates various provisions of the\n\nUnited States Constitution: the Commerce, Takings, and Due Process\n\nClauses.      U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3, amend. V; amend. XIV.\n\n              A threshold issue arose as to whether the Disclosure Act\n\nis     preempted     by   either   the    Federal    Cigarette      Labeling    and\n\n\n3\n   The cigarette and smokeless tobacco manufacturers originally\nfiled two separate suits. They were consolidated for trial and on\nappeal.\n\n                                         -10-\n\fAdvertising     Act,    15   U.S.C.     §    1331-41,      or   the     Comprehensive\n\nSmokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. § 4401-\n\n08.   The district court held that there was no preemption, and we\n\naffirmed.     Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger, 122 F.3d 58 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) [hereinafter Philip Morris I].\n\n            Thereafter, the tobacco companies moved for a preliminary\n\ninjunction based on their constitutional claims.                   On December 10,\n\n1997, the district court entered an order that preliminarily\n\nenjoined    appellants       from    enforcing       the     ingredient-reporting\n\nprovisions of the Disclosure Act until further order of the court.\n\nOn an interlocutory appeal, we again affirmed. Philip Morris, Inc.\n\nv. Harshbarger, 159 F.3d 670 (1st Cir. 1998) [hereinafter Philip\n\nMorris   II].     We     found   that       the   district      court    had   neither\n\n\"committed a clear error of law [nor] an abuse of discretion\" in\n\nfinding that the tobacco companies showed a reasonable likelihood\n\nof success on their claim that the Disclosure Act violates the\n\nTakings Clause.        Id. at 680.\n\n            Following this affirmance, all parties filed motions for\n\nsummary judgment. On September 7, 2000, the district court entered\n\na Memorandum and Order granting the tobacco companies' motions and\n\ndenying appellants' motion for summary judgment.                      Philip Morris,\n\nInc. v. Reilly, 113 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D. Mass. 2000) [hereinafter\n\nPhilip Morris III].          The court found that the Disclosure Act\n\nviolates the Takings, Due Process, and Commerce Clauses and issued\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fa permanent injunction forbidding Massachusetts from requiring the\n\ndisclosure    of    brand-specific      ingredient      information     from   the\n\ntobacco companies.        Id. at 151.\n\n            Appellants filed timely appeals in which they challenged\n\nthe   district     court's   findings       on   the   constitutional    claims.\n\nAdditionally, they argued that the tobacco companies' claims are\n\nnot ripe because the Disclosure Act does not mandate publication of\n\nthe   submitted      ingredient   lists.         In    an   opinion   which    has\n\nsubsequently       been   withdrawn,    a    divided    panel   of    this    Court\n\nreversed.     It found that the tobacco companies' claims are ripe,\n\nbut agreed with appellants that the Disclosure Act does not violate\n\nthe Takings, Due Process, or Commerce Clauses.               The dissent agreed\n\nthat the claims are ripe and the Disclosure Act does not contravene\n\nthe Commerce Clause.         However, it found violations of both the\n\nTakings and Due Process Clauses.\n\n             After a timely petition, we granted en banc review as to\n\nwhether the Disclosure Act violates either the Takings or Due\n\nProcess Clauses. Our review does not include revisiting the issues\n\nof whether the tobacco companies' claims are ripe or whether the\n\nDisclosure Act violates the Commerce Clause.\n\n                                       III.\n\n                             Standard of Review\n\n             Because this case reaches us on appeal from a grant of\n\nsummary judgment, I review the district court's judgment de novo.\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fEuromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 869 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n                                         IV.\n\n                                   Takings Analysis\n\n             The tobacco companies allege, and the district court\n\nfound, that the Disclosure Act unconstitutionally takes the tobacco\n\ncompanies' property when it requires the tobacco companies to\n\ndisclose their ingredient lists to Massachusetts, which may, in\n\nturn, publish those lists.              To support this claim, the tobacco\n\ncompanies first argue that their ingredient lists are trade secrets\n\nand, as      such,   are    property    protected     by    the    Takings    Clause.\n\nSecond, they argue that the public disclosure of these trade\n\nsecrets      destroys      their    value,      thereby    effecting      a   taking.\n\nAppellants counter with two separate arguments.                   First, they claim\n\nthat the tobacco companies' interest in keeping their ingredient\n\nlists secret does not defeat the state's ability to require public\n\ndisclosure where, as here, the requirement is \"rationally related\n\nto a legitimate governmental interest.\"                   Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto\n\nCo.,   467    U.S.   986,     1007     (1984).       The     asserted     legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest is the health and safety of its citizens.\n\nSecond,   appellants        dispute     that    Massachusetts       law   creates   a\n\nproperty interest in trade secrets that are required by law to be\n\ndisclosed to public agencies.                  I begin with analysis of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fquestion     of   whether   Massachusetts   law   protects   the   tobacco\n\ncompanies' ingredient lists as trade secrets.\n\nA.   Trade Secret Protection in Massachusetts\n\n             In most states, trade secrets are property protected by\n\nthe Takings Clause, see Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1003-04 (holding that\n\nMissouri law, which follows the Restatement of Torts, creates\n\ncognizable property right in trade secrets), and neither side\n\ndisputes that Massachusetts has long recognized and protected trade\n\nsecrets.    See Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v. Crampton, 385 N.E.2d 1349,\n\n1354 (Mass. 1972) (noting that Massachusetts has protected trade\n\nsecrets based on public policy principles since at least 1868).\n\nAlso, neither side suggests that Massachusetts treats trade secrets\n\ndifferently from other states or argues that the district court's\n\napplication of the Restatement (First) of Torts was incorrect. See\n\nPhilip Morris III, 113 F. Supp. at 135-36.        Finally, appellants do\n\nnot contest that the tobacco companies' ingredient lists are trade\n\nsecrets.4\n\n            Rather, appellants make a more subtle, but nonetheless\n\nultimately    ineffective,    argument.     Despite   recognizing    that\n\nMassachusetts' laws provide a remedy for misappropriation of trade\n\n\n\n4\n   In regard to the ripeness issue, which is not currently before\nus, appellants did claim that elements of the ingredient lists are\nnot trade secrets as certain ingredients are widely known and\npublished by the tobacco companies, themselves.           However,\nappellants did not argue before the en banc court that the\ningredient lists, in their entirety, are other than trade secrets.\n\n                                   -14-\n\fsecrets by private actors, see Junker v. Plummer, 67 N.E.2d 667,\n\n669-70 (Mass. 1946), appellants argue that Massachusetts has long\n\nestablished that it can require public disclosure of trade secrets\n\nto advance public health and safety.\n\n           In support of this argument, appellants first point to\n\nthe Restatement (First) of Torts which says that the law may\n\nrequire the disclosure of a trade secret to \"promote some public\n\ninterest.\" § 757, cmt. d (1939).             Certainly, courts have long\n\nrecognized   that   trade    secrets     generally     can   be    subject   to\n\ndisclosure under certain limited circumstances.              See, e.g., Corn\n\nProds. Ref. Co. v. Eddy, 249 U.S. 427, 431-32 (1919) (upholding\n\nrequired disclosure of ingredient lists to prevent consumer fraud)\n\n[hereinafter Corn Prods. II].         However, the fact that the public\n\ninterest can sometimes override private property interests does not\n\nestablish that the tobacco companies have no cognizable property\n\ninterest when a state decides that publication of their trade\n\nsecrets   will   further    public   health.      In   fact,   Massachusetts\n\ncontinues to protect the integrity of many trade secrets despite\n\nthe potentially valuable impact on the public interest if those\n\ntrade secrets were to be placed in the public sphere.               See, e.g.,\n\nGen. Chem. Corp. v. Dep't of Env't Quality Eng'g, 474 N.E.2d 183,\n\n185 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985) (discussing Massachusetts statute which\n\nspecifically guarantees confidentiality of trade secrets belonging\n\nto   hazardous    waste     industries      and   submitted       pursuant   to\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fregulations).          Instead, the potential for mandated disclosure in\n\nthe public interest forms part of the inquiry as to whether a\n\nparticular disclosure requirement is constitutional.                    See Penn\n\nCent. Transp. Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978)\n\n(establishing reasonable investment-backed expectations as one\n\nprong     of    the    regulatory     takings    inquiry)     [hereinafter    Penn\n\nCentral].        Finally, the Supreme Court specifically found that\n\njurisdictions which follow the Restatement create a cognizable\n\nproperty interest in trade secrets. Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1003-04.\n\n               Second, appellants argue that General Chemical Corp.\n\nestablishes that the state may generally seize trade secrets in the\n\npublic interest.              That case established no such proposition.\n\nRather,        the    court    only   assumed,    arguendo,     that   the   state\n\nlegislature could deprive hazardous waste industries of certain\n\ntrade secrets in the context of regulating those industries.                    Id.\n\nat 185.    Therefore, the case provides no notice that trade secrets\n\nare subject to disclosure.\n\n               Third,    appellants    point     to   the   Massachusetts    public\n\nrecords law which establishes that when a law requires trade secret\n\ninformation to be filed with a state agency, nothing requires those\n\ntrade secrets to be treated as confidential.                 In fact, the public\n\nrecords law makes such information publicly available.                  See Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 4, § 7, cl. 26 (providing trade secret protection\n\nonly when the information is submitted voluntarily, to further\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fpublic    policy     development,        and        with      a        guarantee     of\n\nconfidentiality).     Therefore, appellants argue that the tobacco\n\ncompanies have no property interest in their ingredient lists once\n\na law requires them to submit that information to the state.\n\nWhether Massachusetts       guarantees        the    confidentiality        of     trade\n\nsecrets once they have been submitted to a state agency has no\n\nbearing on whether Massachusetts creates a property interest in\n\ntrade secrets that is protected by the Takings Clause.                     Holders of\n\ntrade secrets can always voluntarily submit their information to a\n\nstate, consequently losing their property right.                          See, e.g.,\n\nMonsanto, 467 U.S. at 1006-07 (noting that Monsanto had voluntarily\n\nsubmitted its trade secrets information, knowing it was subject to\n\npublic disclosure, as part of a regulatory scheme).                      The question\n\nis not whether trade secrets can be lost but whether trade secrets\n\nare a protected property interest in Massachusetts.\n\n           And the answer to that question is clear.                    Massachusetts\n\nprotects trade secrets, Gen. Chem. Corp., 474 N.E.2d at 185 (\"The\n\nwords 'trade secret' are commonly thought to carry a connotation of\n\na   property   interest.\"),      and   appellants          fail   to    identify    any\n\nbackground     principles   of   state    law       that    successfully      obviate\n\nappellees' property interest in their trade secrets. The fact that\n\ntrade secrets are potentially subject to disclosure does not\n\ndestroy the tobacco companies' interest because trade secrets still\n\nenjoy general protection.        See Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S.\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\f606, 630 (2001) (\"A regulation or common-law rule cannot be a\n\nbackground principle for some owners but not for others. The\n\ndetermination whether an existing, general law can limit all\n\neconomic use of property must turn on objective factors . . . \").\n\nSpecific laws simply cannot destroy property interests.            In fact,\n\nthis is precisely what the Takings Clause is designed to prevent:\n\n\"a State, by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into\n\npublic property without compensation. . . .      This is the very kind\n\nof thing that the Taking Clause of the Fifth Amendment was meant to\n\nprevent.    That clause stands as a shield against the arbitrary use\n\nof governmental power.\"      Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v.\n\nBeckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 164 (1980).      Massachusetts cannot provide\n\ntrade secret protection to some parties and then refuse others the\n\nsame   protections.    Therefore,   it   is   clear   that   the    tobacco\n\ncompanies have a property interest in their trade secrets that is\n\nimplicated by the Disclosure Act.      In light of this, I turn to the\n\nquestion of whether the Disclosure Act violates the Takings Clause.\n\n B.    The Takings Clause\n\n            The Supreme Court has distinguished between two branches\n\nof Takings Clause cases: physical takings and regulatory takings.\n\nSee Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning\n\nAgency, 122 S. Ct. 1465, 1479 (2002) (distinguishing \"between\n\nacquisitions of property for public uses . . . and regulations\n\nprohibiting private uses\") [hereinafter Tahoe-Sierra]; see also Yee\n\n\n                                -18-\n\fv. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 522 (1992) (delineating between\n\nclaims of physical occupation and mere regulation).                A physical\n\ntaking occurs either when there is a condemnation or a physical\n\nappropriation of property.          Tahoe-Sierra, 122 S. Ct. at 1478.\n\nGenerally,   courts    apply   \"straightforward\"        per   se   rules   when\n\naddressing physical takings.        Id.    A regulatory taking transpires\n\nwhen some significant restriction is placed upon an owner's use of\n\nhis   property   for   which   \"justice     and   fairness\"    require     that\n\ncompensation be given.     Goldbatt v. Hempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 594\n\n(1962); accord Penn. Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922)\n\n(\"The general rule at least is that while property may be regulated\n\nto a certain extent, if that regulation goes too far it will be\n\nrecognized as a taking.\").          For the most part, courts apply a\n\nthree-part   \"ad   hoc,   factual    inquiry\"     to    evaluate   whether    a\n\nregulatory taking has occurred: (1) what is the economic impact of\n\nthe regulation; (2) whether the government action interferes with\n\nreasonable investment-backed expectations; and (3) what is the\n\ncharacter of the government action. Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court has developed at least one per se rule\n\nin the regulatory takings sphere.         See Tahoe-Sierra, 122 S. Ct. at\n\n1480.   When a regulation denies all economically beneficial or\n\nproductive uses of land, it is a taking.               Lucas v. S.C. Coastal\n\nCouncil, 505 U.S. 1003, 1015 (1992).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\f          Here, there is an alleged taking of intellectual property\n\n-- trade secrets.      The Supreme Court has addressed an alleged\n\ntaking of trade secrets only once, in Monsanto.      There, the Court\n\nsimply applied   the   multi-factored   regulatory   takings   analysis\n\nenunciated in Penn Central.    Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1004-06.5       It\n\n\n5\n   The concurrence argues that the Supreme Court's application of\nthe Penn Central factors essentially created a special rule for\ntrade secrets that when \"a trade secret holder has a reasonable\ninvestment-backed expectation that its trade secrets will remain\nsecret, the sovereign's use or divulgement of that information\nconstitutes a taking.\" Infra pp. 50-51. This reading of Monsanto\nis too broad. First, the Supreme court has frequently found that\none of the Penn Central factors is dispositive. See, e.g., Hodel\nv. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 716 (1987) (finding that the character of\nthe government action involved determined the issues). This does\nnot transform the inquiry for all subsequent cases which bear a\nclose resemblance.    Penn Central still provides the relevant\ninquiry. Second, the concurrence's reading of Monsanto needlessly\ncalls into question the legitimacy of a whole host of statutes that\nmandate disclosure of private trade secret information under\ncertain limited circumstances. See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. § 2613(a)(3)\n(providing that the EPA shall disclose confidential business\ninformation if \"necessary to protect health of the environment\nagainst an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the\nenvironment.\").\n\n     The concurrence attempts to argue that the broad reading of\nMonsanto does not call into question the legitimacy of many\nregulatory regimes. Unfortunately, the concurrence's argument is\nsimply not persuasive. Section 2613(a)(3) provides for disclosures\nof data submitted under the Toxic Substances Control Act.       15\nU.S.C. § 2601-92.     Under this act, manufacturers of chemical\nsubstances are frequently required to submit data. For example,\nanyone who is going to manufacture or process a new chemical\nsubstance \"is required to submit test data for [that] substance.\"\n15 U.S.C. § 2604(b)(1)(A). The act provides no exemption for trade\nsecret information, either in terms of required submissions or\npossible disclosures. As will be discussed more thoroughly below,\nMonsanto clearly establishes that a manufacturer who submits trade\nsecret information under this provision will lose the right to\nsubsequently claim an unconstitutional taking. 467 U.S. at 1006-07\n                                                    (continued...)\n\n                                -20-\n\f5\n   (...continued)\n(holding that when a manufacturer chose to submit trade secrets\nunder statutes which allowed for future publication of that data,\nno taking occurred).      This, however, does not mean that a\nmanufacturer could not challenge the data submission and disclosure\nprovisions before complying.     That fact scenario is actually\nanalogous to the current case.\n\n     The tobacco companies are challenging the Disclosure Act\nbefore complying with its provisions. They point to general laws\nprotecting trade secrets as evidence of a reasonable investment-\nbacked expectation that those trade secrets will remain protected\nproperty.   The concurrence then wants to take that reasonable\ninvestment-backed expectation and say that Massachusetts can never\noverride the tobacco companies' property interest without violating\nthe Takings Clause:\n\n     [A]ctions speak louder than words.     Once the Monsanto\n     Court found that the trade secret holder possessed a\n     reasonable investment-backed expectation in its trade\n     secrets, the Court determined that such a taking, if not\n     justly compensated, would be unconstitutional. Monsanto,\n     467 U.S. at 1013-14. This treatment mirrors a per se\n     takings analysis.\n\nInfra p.57 n.26. This means that a chemical manufacturer could\nclaim that it has a reasonable investment-backed expectation under\nstate law and, therefore, the federal government may not require\nsubmission and possible publication of its trade secrets.       The\nsituation is indistinguishable from the current case, and the\nconcurrence's per se test leaves no room to consider the\ngovernment's substantial interests in disclosure (protecting public\nhealth and the environment) or if the chemical manufacturer\nreceives a valuable government benefit in return.\n\n     The concurrence asserts an additional distinction between the\nDisclosure Act and various federal statutes: \"the statute provides\nfair warning, and the trade secret holder can assess for itself the\nlikelihood that the government will reveal submitted information.\"\nInfra p. 51 n.23. At its heart, this argument boils down to a\ntiming issue. The federal statutes are not new, and trade secret\nholders know that their trade secrets are potentially subject to\ndisclosure.   In contrast, the Disclosure Act is new, and the\ntobacco companies invested in and developed their trade secrets\nlong before they became subject to disclosure. This, however is\n                                                     (continued...)\n\n                               -21-\n\ffailed to address any physical takings cases, id.,6 and therefore\n\nfailed to resolve whether trade secrets can be the subjects of\n\nphysical takings.   Since the Supreme Court has previously limited\n\n\n\n\n5\n   (...continued)\nnot a valid grounds on which to distinguish the Disclosure Act. In\nPalazzolo, the Court held that the fact a property owner acquired\ntitle to his land after the enactment of a regulation did not bar\nhis claim that the regulation worked an unconstitutional taking.\n\"It suffices to say that a regulation that otherwise would be\nunconstitutional absent compensation is not transformed into a\nbackground principle of the State's law by mere virtue of the\npassage of title.\" Id. at 629-30. Similarly, the fact that some\nstatutes have been on the books for years cannot make those\nstatutes constitutional and invalidate new statutes.\n\n     There is simply no persuasive distinction between many\nexisting regulatory regimes and the Disclosure Act when they are\nanalyzed only according to the trade secret holders' reasonable\ninvestment-backed expectations. A more nuanced inquiry is needed.\n6\n   At the time Monsanto was decided, the most recent Supreme Court\ndecision addressing the Takings Clause was Loretto v. Teleprompter\nManhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419 (1982). Loretto has often been\ncited as a paradigmatic physical takings case. See, e.g., Yee, 503\nU.S. at 522. Therefore, the fact that Monsanto failed to consider\nthe implications of Loretto could be read as a decision that trade\nsecrets may never be the subjects of physical takings. However, I\ndecline to adopt that interpretation. First, Loretto is factually\ninapposite to Monsanto, making its decision of little import to the\nresult in Monsanto.     Second, Loretto itself applied the Penn\nCentral framework which Monsanto relied upon. Loretto, 458 U.S. at\n426. So, it was unclear whether Loretto should be considered as\nbelonging to a separate line of cases.     The Supreme Court only\nlater clarified the distinctions between Loretto and Penn Central.\nSee Yee, 503 U.S. at 522 (articulating that there are, in fact, two\nlines of Takings Clause cases). Third, the Supreme Court has never\nsaid that intellectual property cannot be the subject of physical\ntakings, and I decline to read such a broad statement into the\nfailure of one case to speak to that issue.\n\n                               -22-\n\fits analysis to the regulatory takings sphere, I choose to begin\n\nthere.7\n\n          Before proceeding to the Penn Central analysis, I note\n\nthat the tobacco companies argue that the Lucas per se rule governs\n\nthis case.8   The decision in and reasoning behind Lucas certainly\n\nraise some interesting questions about the constitutionality of the\n\nDisclosure Act.   However, I am uncomfortable with the suggestion\n\nthat we simply import that per se rule into this case.   Lucas dealt\n\nwith real, not personal, property, and the Court cautioned that the\n\nvalue of personal property could be wiped out without triggering\n\nthe strictures of the Takings Clause.   505 U.S. at 1027-28.   This\n\nis not to say that Lucas is not relevant to the disposition of this\n\n\n7\n  I note that the tobacco companies raise a physical takings claim\nwhen they argue that the Disclosure Act deprives them of the right\nto exclude others from their property, namely, their trade secrets.\nIn Kaiser Aetna v. United States, 444 U.S. 164 (1979), the Supreme\nCourt stated that \"the 'right to exclude,' so universally held to\nbe a fundamental element of the property right, falls within this\ncategory of interests that the Government cannot take without\ncompensation.\" Id. at 179-80. Because the Disclosure Act gives\nMassachusetts the right to publish the ingredient lists, the\ntobacco companies say they have lost the ability to exclude others\nfrom their property. This, they claim, is a per se taking.\n8\n   As noted above, Lucas states that there is a per se taking\nwhenever regulation destroys all beneficial uses of land. 505 U.S.\nat 1015. Because they have lost the ability to exclude others from\nusing their trade secrets, the tobacco companies argue that their\nproperty has lost all value. As support for their argument, the\ntobacco companies cite Monsanto which holds that the main value of\ntrade secrets lies in the ability to exclude others. 467 U.S. at\n1012. Once a trade secret is disclosed to another who is under no\nobligation to protect the information, its value is gone.      Id.\nTherefore, according to the tobacco companies, the Disclosure Act\nworks a per se taking.\n\n                               -23-\n\fcase.   Cf. Nixon v. United States, 978 F.2d 1269, 1284-85 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1992) (arguing that there is no compelling distinction between\n\nreal and personal property as to make the application of per se\n\nrules inappropriate in regard to personal property).            Rather, I\n\nsimply choose to address these arguments while also considering the\n\nPenn Central factors.\n\n          Furthermore,   I   note    that   applying   the   Penn    Central\n\nregulatory takings framework is not practically different from\n\nutilizing per se rules.       Functionally, these per se rules are\n\nsimply shortcuts.     See Tahoe-Sierra, 122 S. Ct. at 1478 n.17\n\n(explaining that the same premise underlies both regulatory and\n\nphysical takings cases but that the analysis is simply more complex\n\nfor regulatory takings).     An example of this principle is Loretto,\n\na case which announced a per se rule in a physical takings context.\n\nSee Tahoe-Sierra, 122 S. Ct. at 1478-79 (identifying the situation\n\nin Loretto as one which categorically requires compensation).\n\nThere, the Court recited the Penn Central factors but then held\n\nthat \"when a physical intrusion reaches the extreme form of a\n\npermanent physical occupation, a taking has occurred.\"              Loretto,\n\n458 U.S. at 426.    The character of the government action was the\n\ndispositive factor, and the Court bypassed the remaining Penn\n\nCentral factors.     Id. at 435.        Similarly, in some regulatory\n\ntakings cases, one factor is frequently dispositive.           See Hodel,\n\n481 U.S. at 717 (focusing on the character of the government\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\faction);   see   also   Monsanto,    467   U.S.    at   1005   (finding   the\n\ninterference with reasonable investment-backed expectations to be\n\ndispositive).    There is, of course, one stark difference: once a\n\nper se rule has been announced, future courts do not have the\n\nluxury to consider the public interest, reasonable investment-\n\nbacked expectations, or economic impact.          Were I to import a per se\n\nrule into this case, either in a physical or regulatory takings\n\ncontext, I would ignore those Penn Central factors.                However,\n\nwhether I apply a regulatory takings analysis or a per se rule\n\nshould not impact the ultimate decision.           If the Disclosure Act's\n\nprovisions are so \"extraordinary,\" Hodel, 481 U.S. at 716, as to\n\nmake it properly subject to a per se rule, the considerations that\n\nled to adoption of that rule will also counsel me to find a taking\n\nunder the Penn Central framework. Therefore, the concerns of Lucas\n\nwill continue to inform my analysis.\n\n           As a final point before considering the Penn Central\n\nfactors as they apply to this case, I would like to address the\n\nheavy charge leveled by the concurrence: that application of the\n\nPenn Central framework to this case ignores principles of stare\n\ndecisis.   See infra p. 51.         I emphatically disagree with this\n\ncharacterization and am of the view that such a conclusion is only\n\npossible by the use of a self-serving definition of the term stare\n\ndecisis.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\f           As noted by the concurrence, the jurisprudence in this\n\narea is convoluted and subject to various interpretations.                         The\n\nfact that the concurrence and I understand Monsanto differently is\n\nnot surprising.        What is surprising is that the concurrence takes\n\nthat understandable difference in opinion and translates it into an\n\naccusation that I am ignoring stare decisis.                       The heart of our\n\ndisagreement lies with our conflicting interpretations of Monsanto,\n\nparticularly as to the Court's discussion of the second scheme.\n\nSee infra pp. 26-31, 35-43, 45-47. The concurrence finds that this\n\ndiscussion disposes of our current case and I simply do not agree,\n\nfor reasons explained elsewhere.                  I do not think that Monsanto\n\nestablished      a    per    se    rule   that     once   a   trade   secret   holder\n\nestablishes      a     reasonable         investment-backed         expectation    the\n\ngovernment    may      not   require      disclosure      without     triggering   the\n\nprotections of the Takings Clause.                 Since I interpret Monsanto to\n\nrequire courts to apply the Penn Central framework in cases like\n\nours, I now proceed with that analysis.\n\n           i.        Reasonable Investment-Backed Expectations\n\n           Despite the importance of reasonable investment-backed\n\nexpectations under the Penn Central framework, the courts have\n\nstruggled to adequately define this term.                      See generally R.S.\n\nRadford & J. David Breemer, Great Expectations: Will Palazzolo v.\n\nRhode   Island       Clarify      the   Murky     Doctrine    of   Investment-Backed\n\nExpectations in Regulatory Takings Law?, 99 N.Y.U. Envtl. L.J. 449,\n\n\n                                           -26-\n\f449-50 (2001).         Some very general contours are clear.                  Courts\n\nprotect    only    reasonable      expectations.         Ideally,    the    relevant\n\ninquiry    should      recognize     that    not   every    investment      deserves\n\nprotection and that some investors inevitably will be disappointed.\n\nSee Frank I. Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness: Comments\n\non the Ethical Foundations of \"Just Compensation\" Law, 80 Harv. L.\n\nRev. 1165, 1213 (1967).            However, beyond the general landscape,\n\nthere is a paucity of clear landmarks that can be used to navigate\n\nthe terrain.       Some recent decisions have added specific details,\n\nsee,    e.g.,   Palazzolo,     533    U.S.   at    627   (holding    that    whether\n\nproperty is acquired before or after a regulation is enacted does\n\nnot completely determine the owner's reasonable investment-backed\n\nexpectations), but many areas are still uncharted.                   As I proceed\n\ninto this quagmire, the first guidepost is Monsanto.\n\n            Monsanto answered a challenge to disclosures by the EPA\n\nof data which had been submitted under the Federal Insecticide,\n\nFungicide, and Rodenticide Act (\"FIFRA\").                  7 U.S.C. §§ 136-136y.\n\nFIFRA was enacted in 1947, amended in 1972, and amended again in\n\n1978, each time offering different protections to submitted data.\n\nMonsanto challenged disclosures of data which had been submitted\n\nunder    each     of   these   schemes,      and   the     Court   looked    at   the\n\nprotections provided by each scheme to determine whether applicants\n\nhad a reasonable investment-backed expectation that their trade\n\nsecrets would remain secret.           Following the Supreme Court's lead,\n\n\n                                       -27-\n\fI     recount   the   provisions    of    each   scheme   and   the    Court's\n\ncorresponding concerns.\n\n            In the period between 1947 and 1972, \"FIFRA was primarily\n\na licensing and labeling statute,\" Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 991, and\n\nit failed to specify the government's ability to use and disclose\n\ndata     submitted    by   pesticide     manufacturers.     Id.   at    1008.\n\nTherefore, manufacturers like Monsanto had no guarantee that their\n\ndata would be treated confidentially, nor did the government have\n\nspecific authority to disclose such data. Id. The Court concluded\n\nthat without a guarantee of confidentiality, Monsanto had no\n\nreasonable investment-backed expectation that its submitted data\n\nwould remain secret.       Id.   Therefore, any disclosures of this data\n\nby the government did not constitute an unconstitutional taking of\n\nproperty.\n\n            The 1972 amendments transformed FIFRA from a labeling\n\nstatute to a \"comprehensive regulatory statute.\"                Id. at 991.\n\nAdditional requirements were imposed on pesticides submitted for\n\nregistration, and the EPA, as the administrative agency in charge\n\nof such regulations, gained additional enforcement powers.              Id. at\n\n991-92.    Congress also amended FIFRA to provide for certain public\n\ndisclosures of data, but it explicitly prohibited the EPA from\n\ndisclosing information which was deemed to be a trade secret.              Id.\n\nat 992.    Another addition was a \"mandatory data-licensing scheme.\"\n\nId.    This allowed the EPA to use data submitted by one registrant\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\fwhen considering subsequent applications as long as those later\n\napplicants agreed to compensate the original registrant.                    Id.\n\n            It     was     this     second   scheme    that    raised   possible\n\nconstitutional problems.             Id. at 1010-14.      The difference arose\n\nbecause there was an \"explicit governmental guarantee [which]\n\nformed the basis of a reasonable investment-backed expectation\"\n\nthat submitted data, designated as trade secrets, would be kept\n\nconfidential.          Id. at 1011.     A trade secret's value lies in the\n\n\"right to exclude others.\"             Id.      If others are given the trade\n\nsecret, the \"holder of the trade secret has lost his property\n\ninterest.\"       Id.     Therefore, if the government discloses the data\n\nthat    Monsanto       submitted    during   this   second    period,   a   taking\n\npotentially occurs because the disclosure destroys the value of\n\nMonsanto's trade secrets.            Id. at 1013-14.      Whether such a taking\n\nis unconstitutional hinges on whether Monsanto received adequate\n\ncompensation, a question not before the Court.                Id.\n\n            The final amendments relevant to Monsanto occurred in\n\n1978.    They provided that any data submitted could be cited and\n\nconsidered by subsequent applications for fifteen years, so long as\n\nthe original submitter is compensated.               Id. at 994.    Finally, any\n\nqualified    person       could    request   that   all   health,    safety,      and\n\nenvironmental      data     be     disclosed,    regardless   of    whether    such\n\n\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\finformation had been designated a trade secret.9              Here, it was\n\ndispositive that Monsanto knew that the government might disclose\n\nany confidential data:\n\n          If, despite the data-consideration and data-\n          disclosure provisions in the statute, Monsanto\n          chose to submit the requisite data in order to\n          receive a registration, it can hardly argue\n          that    its    reasonable    investment-backed\n          expectations are disturbed when EPA acts to\n          use or disclose the data in a manner that was\n          authorized by law at the time of the\n          submission.\n\nId. at 1006-07.       This notice negated any reasonable investment-\n\nbacked expectations and, consequently, Monsanto's argument that a\n\ntaking had occurred.\n\n             Despite appellants' arguments to the contrary, neither\n\nthe first nor the third regime presented in Monsanto is directly\n\nanalogous to the Disclosure Act.          One stark difference sets them\n\nboth apart and undermines their usefulness in this case.            Monsanto\n\ncomplained    about    current   and   future   disclosures    of    already\n\nsubmitted data.       Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1004 (\"Having determined\n\nthat Monsanto has a property interest in the data it has submitted\n\nto EPA, we confront the difficult question whether a 'taking' will\n\n\n\n9\n    The 1978 amendments did provide some exclusions, including\nwhether disclosure \"would reveal 'manufacturing or quality control\nprocesses' or certain details about deliberately added inert\ningredients.\" Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 996 (quoting 7 U.S.C. § 136h\n(d)(1)(A)). However, even these prohibitions can be overridden if\nit is determined that \"'disclosure is necessary to protect against\nan unreasonable risk of injury to health or environment.'\" Id.\n(quoting 7 U.S.C. § 136h(d)(1)).\n\n                                   -30-\n\foccur when EPA discloses those data. . . .\" (emphasis added)).       In\n\nanswering that challenge, the Court measured Monsanto's reasonable\n\ninvestment-backed expectations at the time it submitted the data.\n\nBecause there was no promise by the government under these two\n\nschemes to keep the data confidential, Monsanto had no basis on\n\nwhich to expect that its data would remain secret.       In essence,\n\nMonsanto had \"constructive notice\" that its trade secrets might\n\nlater be made public.    Here, the tobacco companies challenge the\n\nability of Massachusetts to compel future submissions of data which\n\nwould be subject to disclosure.     The tobacco companies have not\n\nvoluntarily provided their ingredient lists.       Therefore, their\n\nsituation is fundamentally different from two of the scenarios that\n\nconfronted Monsanto.10\n\n            The second scheme addressed by the Monsanto Court does\n\nshed some light on the current case, but it is not entirely\n\ndispositive.     There, FIFRA provided Monsanto with an explicit\n\nguarantee   of   confidentiality.   This   guarantee   established    a\n\nreasonable investment-backed expectation that Monsanto's trade\n\n\n10\n   There is one element of the third Monsanto scheme which does not\nsuffer from the same timing problem.         467 U.S. at 1007-08\n(addressing Monsanto's argument that the final statutory scheme\ncreated an unconstitutional condition). I will return to this when\nI discuss whether the Disclosure Act is constitutional because it\noffers the tobacco companies a \"valuable government benefit\" in\nexchange for the submission of the ingredient lists. Nollan v.\nCal. Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 833 n.2 (1987). Here, I simply\nnote that this holding in Monsanto did not address Monsanto's\nreasonable investment-backed expectations. Monsanto, 467 U.S. at\n1008.\n\n                                -31-\n\fsecrets would remain protected.        When the Court decided that the\n\ngovernment   could   not   disclose    submitted   data   which   had   been\n\nguaranteed confidentiality, the Court simply enforced the terms of\n\nthe statute.    Here, Massachusetts only generally protects trade\n\nsecrets, establishing a right to recovery when a third party\n\ndiscloses or uses a trade secret without permission, Jet Spray\n\nCooler, 385 N.E.2d at 1354, and the Disclosure Act only provides\n\nfor publication of submitted data.         It explicitly disclaims any\n\nlong-term confidentiality.11      This distinction is important because\n\na trade secret is lost if its holder gives the trade secret to\n\nanother   without    extracting    a   guarantee    of    confidentiality.\n\nMonsanto, 467 U.S. at 1002.       Monsanto preserved its trade secrets\n\nbecause there was a promise of confidentiality.               The tobacco\n\ncompanies will lose their trade secrets because there is no similar\n\npromise here. Therefore, a slightly different question is posed by\n\nthe current case.      In Monsanto, the question was whether the\n\ngovernment could disclose trade secrets it had previously agreed to\n\n\n\n\n11\n   As the concurrence correctly notes, the tobacco companies are\nhardly in a position to force the Massachusetts legislature to\nguarantee confidentiality to submitted trade secrets. Furthermore,\nas this opinion addresses later, the tobacco companies are\ncurrently placed in the untenable position of having to choose\nbetween relinquishing their valuable trade secrets or pulling their\nproducts out of Massachusetts.       This is an unconstitutional\ncondition. However, the fact that Massachusetts is creating an\nunconstitutional condition has little, if anything, to do with\nwhether the tobacco companies have a reasonable investment-backed\nexpectation that their trade secrets will remain protected.\n\n                                   -32-\n\fkeep secret. Here, the question is whether Massachusetts can force\n\nthe tobacco companies to cede their trade secrets.\n\n           To answer that question I must look at the tobacco\n\ncompanies' reasonable investment-backed expectations that they can\n\nmaintain the integrity of their trade secrets.      The fact that the\n\nDisclosure Act has been enacted is not dispositive because, as\n\ndiscussed above, Massachusetts cannot simply redefine property\n\nrights without regard to previously existing protections.             See\n\nWebb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc., 449 U.S. at 164; cf. Palazzolo,\n\n533 U.S. at 627 (holding that enactment of a regulation inhibiting\n\ndevelopment before a purchaser acquires his property does not alone\n\nnegate the purchaser's reasonable investment-backed expectations\n\nbecause otherwise \"[a] State would be allowed, in effect, to put an\n\nexpiration date on the Takings Clause\").          I must examine the\n\ntobacco companies' reasonable investment-backed expectations \"in\n\nlight of the whole of our legal tradition,\" Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1035\n\n(Kennedy, J., concurring), not just in light of the provisions of\n\nthe Disclosure Act.\n\n           To understand that legal tradition, I begin with a\n\nSupreme Court case from the early twentieth century which arguably\n\nprovides   constructive   notice    that   ingredient   lists   are   not\n\ninviolable.   In Corn Products II, the Court considered whether it\n\nwas a taking to require a manufacturer to disclose its ingredient\n\nlist.   In a tersely worded decision, the Court simply said:\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\f          And it is too plain for argument that a\n          manufacturer or vendor has no constitutional\n          right to sell goods without giving to the\n          purchaser fair information of what it is that\n          is being sold. The right of a manufacturer to\n          maintain secrecy as to his compounds and\n          processes must be held subject to the right of\n          the state, in the exercise of its police power\n          and in promotion of fair dealing, to require\n          that the nature of the product be fairly set\n          forth.\n249 U.S. at 431-32 (emphasis added). While this language can be\n\nread   to   suggest    that    ingredient        lists   are    subject    to    full\n\ndisclosure, it refers only to \"fair information.\"                      Such \"fair\n\ninformation\" could be something short of complete disclosure of all\n\nadditives.     For example, if Massachusetts found that the addition\n\nof one or more ingredients to tobacco products presented a health\n\nrisk, disclosing when those specific ingredients are used might\n\nconstitute \"fair information.\" Cf. Minn. Stat. § 461.17 (requiring\n\nmanufacturers to report the use of ammonia, arsenic, cadmium,\n\nformaldehyde,    and    lead       in   tobacco   products      and   making     such\n\ninformation public record).\n\n             This second interpretation gains credence from a closer\n\nreading of Corn Products II.            The Court was addressing not a public\n\nhealth statute but a statute to prevent consumer deception.                      Corn\n\nProds.   II,   249    U.S.    at    431    (\"Evidently    the    purpose    of    the\n\n[labeling] requirement is to secure freedom from adulteration and\n\nmisbranding. . . .\").        To prevent deception, it might make sense to\n\nrequire a complete list of ingredients.              Only requiring a partial\n\nlist could, in fact, increase consumer deception.                     In contrast,\n\n                                          -34-\n\fthere is no evidence in the record that publication of only those\n\ningredients which create health risks undermines the goal of\n\npromoting public health.   In fact, such partial lists seem closest\n\nto the \"fair information\" referred to in the Corn Products II\n\ndecision.12\n\n          More   recent   regulation,   of   both   tobacco   and   other\n\nproducts, supports the idea that \"fair information\" is not always\n\na complete ingredient list. While the federal government and other\n\nstates worry about the health effects of tobacco additives, none of\n\ntheir regimes requires the publication of brand-specific ingredient\n\n\n\n12\n   I also note that the factual and procedural history of this case\ncautions me against a broad interpretation of its language. Corn\nProducts II reached the Court on appeal from a decision of the\nKansas Supreme Court. Corn Prods. Ref. Co. v. Eddy, 163 P. 615\n(Kan. 1916) [hereinafter Corn Prods. I]. The Kansas court had held\nthat its State Board of Health could enforce the state labeling\nlaws against the plaintiff, Corn Products.       The plaintiff was\nselling a syrup called \"Mary Jane\" which failed to comply with\nKansas law in two relevant respects: the label failed to identify\n\"Mary Jane\" as a compound and to specify its place of manufacture.\nId. at 615. The label did list the product's ingredients, in order\nof relative amount. Id. When the case reached the Supreme Court,\nthe plaintiff raised its claim that the Kansas statute, which\nrequired ingredients to be listed in order of relative amount,\nconstituted an unconstitutional taking. Corn Prods. II, 249 U.S.\nat 431. It was then that the Supreme Court held that a state may\nrequire accurate labeling of products. Id. However, this argument\nand, consequently, its result, is a little confusing. The formula\nfor \"Mary Jane\" was not a secret. It was clearly published on the\nlabel.   See Corn Prods. I, 163 P. at 615.        It had also been\nregistered with the Patent Office.     See id.     The dispute with\nKansas centered not on the requirement that ingredients be listed,\nbut on the need to add the word \"compound\" and the place of\nmanufacture to the label. Therefore, the claim that a state could\nnot require disclosure of a secret formula was not a well-developed\ncontroversy.\n\n                                -35-\n\flists.    They either do not require brand-specific disclosures, or\n\nthey   grant    the    tobacco     companies     protections      against         public\n\ndisclosure      of    ingredient      lists      submitted      to     the    states.\n\nFurthermore, regulations governing other products recognize the\n\ndifference     between     requiring      accurate     labeling      and   protecting\n\nsecret formulas.        For example, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act\n\nallows additives to be grouped as \"spices, flavoring, and coloring\"\n\nwithout specifically identifying the individual ingredients.                          21\n\nU.S.C. § 343(i)(2).           This allows many manufacturers to maintain\n\ntheir secret formulas.\n\n             Given     this     complex    background     and     the      fact     that\n\nMassachusetts has long protected trade secrets, see Jet Spray\n\nCooler,   385     N.E.2d   at    1354,    I   cannot    hold    that    the   tobacco\n\ncompanies have no reasonable investment-backed expectation that\n\ntheir ingredient lists will remain secret. Therefore, I proceed to\n\nthe other elements of the Penn Central inquiry.\n\n            ii.      Economic Impact\n\n            In contrast to reasonable investment-backed expectations,\n\nthe law regarding economic impact is fairly straightforward.                        The\n\ninquiry is whether the regulation \"impair[s] the value or use of\n\n[the] property\" according to the owners' general use of their\n\nproperty.      Pruneyard Shopping Ctr., 447 U.S. at 83.                    Not only is\n\nthe use to which the property owner puts her property important,\n\nbut the economic impact needs to be considered in the context of\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\fother laws and regulatory schemes. See Connolly v. Pension Benefit\n\nGuar. Corp., 475 U.S. 211, 225-26 (1986) (evaluating economic\n\nimpact of imposing withdrawal fees on employers who leave pension\n\nfunds within context of entire ERISA scheme).\n\n           The evidence presented here is similarly straightforward.\n\nThe appellees' have spent millions of dollars developing the\n\nformulas for different brands.         The evidence shows that public\n\ndisclosure of the appellees' ingredient lists, even in part, will\n\nmake it much easier to reverse engineer those formulas.                  If\n\ncompetitors   can   obtain   these     formulas,   they    can     replicate\n\nappellees' products, undermining the value of appellees' brands.\n\nSome of those brands, such as Marlboro, are worth billions of\n\ndollars.   While it is impossible to predict the exact economic\n\nimpact that   the   Disclosure   Act   will   have,   it   is    potentially\n\ntremendous.\n\n           iii.   Character of the Government Action\n\n           In this last section, I delve into how the Disclosure Act\n\nregulates and what that regulation does to the tobacco companies'\n\ntrade secrets.    See Hodel, 481 U.S. at 716 (examining the effect of\n\nthe escheat provisions of the Indian Land Consolidation Act of\n\n1983).   As mentioned above, the tobacco companies believe that the\n\nDisclosure Act regulations are so egregious that they rise to the\n\nlevel of a per se taking.    They ground this claim on the fact that\n\nthe Disclosure Act gives Massachusetts the right to publish the\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\fingredient lists.        The Act, in essence, prevents the tobacco\n\ncompanies     from    excluding   others     from   their    trade    secrets,\n\ndestroying their essential attribute. It also, allegedly, destroys\n\nthe entire value of the trade secrets.               I now address those\n\narguments in full.      However, I will also balance the effects of the\n\nDisclosure Act against Massachusetts' interests.                 See Keystone\n\nBituminous Coal Ass'n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 488 (1987)\n\n(considering    the    state's    asserted   interests      in   \"health,   the\n\nenvironment, and the fiscal integrity of the area\") [hereinafter\n\nKeystone].     Here, the asserted state interest is the promotion of\n\npublic health.\n\n             I begin with the tobacco companies' argument that they\n\nwill lose the right to exclude others from their trade secrets and,\n\nconsequently, their trade secrets will lose all value.               It appears\n\nparadigmatic that these assertions are true.                In Monsanto, the\n\nSupreme Court recognized that, \"[i]f an individual discloses his\n\ntrade secret to others who are under no obligation to protect the\n\nconfidentiality of the information, or otherwise publicly discloses\n\nthe secret, his property right is extinguished.\" 467 U.S. at 1002.\n\nThat is exactly what happens here. The Disclosure Act requires the\n\ntobacco companies to share their trade secrets with Massachusetts,\n\nwhich is under no obligation to keep the information secret.13               In\n\n\n13\n   The dissent argues that there is indeed \"an unambiguous promise\nof confidentiality\" given to the tobacco companies. In support of\nthis proposition, the dissent correctly notes that the tobacco\n\n                                    -38-\n\ffact,   the   Disclosure   Act   spells   out   the   terms   under   which\n\nMassachusetts will publish those trade secrets. It, thus, provides\n\nspecific notice to the tobacco companies that Massachusetts need\n\nnot respect their property rights.          Therefore, if the tobacco\n\ncompanies comply with the requirements of the Disclosure Act, their\n\nproperty right will be extinguished.            In the future, should a\n\n\ncompanies are promised confidentiality until the requirements for\ndisclosure are met. Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105 § 660.200(G)(2). As\npreviously identified, those requirements are simply (1) that\nMassachusetts finds that disclosure \"could reduce risks to public\nhealth\" and (2) that the Massachusetts Attorney General finds that\nsuch disclosure would not constitute an unconstitutional taking.\nMass. Gen. Laws § 307B. The enabling regulations also promise that\nthe confidentiality of the ingredient lists will be maintained\nduring any litigation challenging specific disclosures.      Mass.\nRegs. Code tit. 105 § 660.200(G)(2). While the dissent correctly\ndescribes the law, this does not undermine my point. Essentially,\nMassachusetts only promises confidentiality until it finds that\ndisclosure \"could\" benefit public health.     As discussed in the\ntext, it is this low burden that is problematic.        Should the\ntobacco companies comply with the Disclosure Act and Massachusetts\ndecide to publish some information from the submitted ingredient\nlists because such publication \"could\" benefit public health, the\ntobacco companies cannot complain that this standard is too low.\nThat is exactly the situation that confronted Monsanto, and the\nSupreme Court held that Monsanto was bound by the terms of the\nstatute in effect when its data had been submitted. Monsanto, 467\nU.S. 1006-07. Nothing distinguishes that situation from the one\nthat the dissent contemplates.\n\n     The dissent also finds that third parties will be unable to\ncompel disclosure of the ingredient lists under the public records\nstatute. Materials or data that are \"specifically or by necessary\nimplication exempted from disclosure by statute\" are clearly\nexempted from the definition of a public record. Mass. Gen. Laws\nch. 4, § 7, cl. 26(g).      However, whether the Disclosure Act\nprovides such a specific or necessary implication of exemption is\na question for the Massachusetts courts, not this court. Until the\nlower courts decide this question in the affirmative, the tobacco\ncompanies risk publication of their ingredient lists by complying\nwith the Disclosure Act.\n\n                                  -39-\n\fcompetitor use published data, the tobacco companies will have no\n\nability to enforce their rights.             See Jet Spray Cooler, 385 N.E.2d\n\nat 1354 (\"The essence of an action for the wrongful use of trade\n\nsecrets is the breach of the duty not to disclose or to use without\n\npermission      confidential    information        acquired    from   another.\").\n\nSimilarly, the value of the trade secrets will be lost because\n\ntheir value lies in the ability of the tobacco companies to exclude\n\nothers.     See Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1012.                 The Disclosure Act\n\nessentially destroys the tobacco companies' trade secrets.\n\n             This fact may very well prove to be dispositive in this\n\ncase.     In Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.S. 40 (1960), the\n\nSupreme Court considered the implications of a government action\n\nwhich, as a secondary effect, destroyed a private party's lien.\n\nThe     Court   held   that    this    was     a   taking     and   \"not   a    mere\n\n'consequential incidence' of a valid regulatory measure.\"                      Id. at\n\n48.     The Court then continued: \"Before the liens were destroyed,\n\nthe lienholders admittedly had compensable property.                   Immediately\n\nafterwards, they had none.            This was not because their property\n\nvanished into thin air.        It was because the Government for its own\n\nadvantage destroyed the value of the liens.\"                Id.     The Disclosure\n\nAct creates a similar situation.               The tobacco companies have a\n\n\n\n\n                                       -40-\n\fprotected     property     interest    which      the     Disclosure    Act   will\n\ncompletely destroy.14\n\n             On the other hand, in Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51\n\n(1979), the     Supreme     Court    made    it   clear   that   regulation    can\n\nseverely undermine the economic value of personal property and not\n\nrise to the level of a taking.              Id. at 66.      There, the federal\n\ngovernment had banned sales of all items containing eagle parts.\n\nId. at 56.    The end result was that some people who had artifacts\n\nmade   of   lawfully      acquired   eagle    parts     could    not   sell   their\n\nproducts.      Id.   at    62-63.      Consequently,       the   artifacts    lost\n\nessentially all of their economic value.              Id. at 66 (positing that\n\nsome value could be extracted by displaying the artifacts for an\n\nadmissions charge).         While this was a \"significant restriction,\"\n\nthe Court held that this \"destruction of one 'strand' of the\n\n\n14\n    One might acknowledge that the Disclosure Act destroys the\ntobacco companies' trade secrets but argue that because those trade\nsecrets are inexorably tied to the underlying formulas, their\ndestruction does not constitute an unconstitutional taking. In one\ncase, the Supreme Court suggested that certain property interests\ncan be completely extinguished so long as they are attendant to\nother property rights. Keystone, 480 U.S. at 501 (upholding a law\nwhich entirely destroyed the support estate because it \"has value\nonly insofar as it protects or enhances the value of the estate\nwith which it is associated.\").       That result simply is not\napplicable here. Keystone confronted an idiosyncratic regime which\nseparated the support estate from the surface estate. Id. at 500.\nThis odd scenario, alone, is probably sufficient to confine\nKeystone to its facts. Additionally, the Supreme Court has held\nthat trade secrets are entitled to their own protections under the\nTakings Clause. Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1001-04. Therefore, it is\nclear that the tobacco companies' trade secrets are not attendant\nrights which can be destroyed, at least, so long as the tobacco\ncompanies can continue to use their formulas.\n\n                                      -41-\n\fbundle\" of property rights did not constitute a taking.                Id.\n\nRather,   the    substantial   state   interest   in   preserving   eagles\n\njustified the regulation.      Id. at 58 (discussing policy rationale\n\nbehind the regulation) and 66-68 (upholding the regulation despite\n\nthe burden it places on lawful property owners).\n\n           The end result reached in Andrus, however, must be\n\ncompared with the result in Hodel.15       In Hodel, the Supreme Court\n\naddressed whether the Indian Land Consolidation Act of 1983 created\n\nan unconstitutional taking when it destroyed the rights of descent\n\nand devise which had previously attached to undivided fractional\n\ninterests in land.     481 U.S. at 706-10.   Congress had enacted this\n\nlegislation to attempt to revise an \"administratively unworkable\n\nand economically wasteful\" system of administering Indian lands.\n\nId. at 707.     To further that goal, the statute destroyed the rights\n\nof descent and devise for small fractional interests of land and,\n\ninstead, had those interests escheat to the tribe.           Id. at 709.\n\nThis, in fact, was such an \"extraordinary\" government action as to\n\nmake it a taking, despite the indeterminancy of the other Penn\n\n\n\n15\n   Whether these two cases can actually be reconciled is unclear.\nWhen Hodel was decided, the Court split on the implications that\nits decision had on the precedential value of Andrus.       Compare\nHodel, 481 U.S. at 719 (Scalia, J., concurring) (suggesting that\nHodel limits Andrus to its facts) with id. at 718 (Brennan, J.,\nconcurring) (suggesting that Hodel is a unique case which should be\nlimited to its facts). Both these concurrences imply that Hodel\nand Andrus cannot be fully reconciled, that one must be limited to\nits facts. Fortunately, that case does not force us to address the\nconflict that lies at the heart of this controversy.\n\n                                  -42-\n\fCentral   factors     and   the   \"serious    public   problem\"     which   the\n\nregulation addressed.        Id. at 714-18.\n\n            The question then arises as to which line of cases\n\ngoverns here.         The simple loss of economic value, alone, is\n\nprobably not enough.        See Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1027-28 (noting that\n\nregulations     can     constitutionally      render    personal     property\n\n\"economically        worthless\").          \"[G]overnment     regulation--by\n\ndefinition--involves the adjustment of rights for the public good.\n\nOften this adjustment curtails some potential for the use or\n\neconomic exploitation of private property. To require compensation\n\nin all such circumstances would effectively compel the government\n\nto regulate by purchase.\"         Andrus, 444 U.S. at 65.          There is a\n\npoint, however, at which compensation is due, see Penn. Coal Co.,\n\n260 U.S. at 415, and this is not simply a case where the tobacco\n\ncompanies' property has been rendered worthless.             Their property\n\nright has     been    \"extinguished.\"      Monsanto,   467   U.S.    at   1002.\n\nConsequently, it appears unconstitutional.\n\n            Appellants urge us, however, to consider the asserted\n\nstate interest, promoting public health, as a counterbalance.16               I\n\n\n16\n   The concurrence argues that the state's interest in disclosure\nshould not play a factor in the decision because Monsanto simply\nlooked to the reasonable investment-backed expectations despite\npublic health concerns. See infra pp. 54-55. However, Monsanto\npresented a different problem, as discussed above. In enacting the\nsecond scheme, Congress made an up-front decision to protect the\nintegrity of submitted trade secrets and promised confidentiality.\nThe government could not later decide that public health concerns\noverrode that explicit government promise.      Here, there is no\n\n                                    -43-\n\frecognize that appellants have asserted a significant, perhaps\n\ncompelling, state interest: a right for Massachusetts to protect\n\nand promote the health of its citizens.      If I was convinced that\n\nthis regulation was tailored to promote health and was the best\n\nstrategy to do so, I might reconsider our analysis. Numerous cases\n\nshow that a crucial part of the regulatory takings equation is the\n\ngovernment interest.   See, e.g., Keystone, 480 U.S. at 488 (\"[T]he\n\nnature of the State's interest is a critical factor in determining\n\nwhether a taking has occurred.\").       However, the cases also show\n\nthat the means should bear some reasonable relationship to the\n\nends.   See id. at 487 n.16 (noting that Pennsylvania Coal Co.\n\nrejected   the   legislature's   proffered   goal   in   enacting   the\n\nregulation when it found an unconstitutional taking).\n\n           I simply am not convinced that the Disclosure Act,\n\nparticularly the provisions about which the tobacco companies\n\ncomplain, really helps to promote public health.         The Disclosure\n\nAct allows for full disclosure of the ingredient lists when doing\n\nso \"could\" further public health.       This places an extremely low\n\nburden on Massachusetts.     Frankly, for a state to be able to\n\ncompletely destroy valuable trade secrets, it should be required to\n\nshow more than a possible beneficial effect.        Cf. Keystone, 480\n\nU.S. at 485-93 (explaining that courts should balance the public\n\n\nexplicit government promise of confidentiality, and the Supreme\nCourt has factored the public interest into the Penn Central\nframework.\n\n                                 -44-\n\fand private interests when evaluating regulatory takings claims).\n\nThe tremendous individual loss is simply not justified by such a\n\nspeculative public gain.         Furthermore, it is not at all clear that\n\nprotecting    the     overall    integrity    of     the   tobacco    companies'\n\ningredient    lists    will     interfere    with    Massachusetts'     goal    of\n\npromoting public health.           See Hodel, 481 U.S. at 717-18 (\"The\n\ndifference in this case is the fact that both descent and devise\n\nare    completely   abolished;     indeed    they    are   abolished    even   in\n\ncircumstances when the governmental purpose sought to be advanced,\n\nconsolidation of ownership of Indian lands, does not conflict with\n\nthe further descent of the property.\").              I note that the tobacco\n\ncompanies comply, without complaint, with regimes which require\n\nthem to make confidential disclosure of brand-specific, ingredient\n\ninformation, see Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 161.351-55, or\n\nwhich require public disclosures when specific ingredients are\n\nused, see Minn. Stat. § 461.17.        There is no evidence that suggests\n\nthat regimes similar to those adopted by Texas and Minnesota, or\n\nsome    combination    thereof,    would    not     achieve   the    goals   which\n\nappellants claim underlie the requirements of the Disclosure Act.17\n\n\n\n\n17\n   In fact, the regime adopted by Massachusetts may actually be\nless effective at promoting public health. If entire ingredient\nlists are published, those ingredients which might pose a danger to\nhealth may very well be buried in the middle or end of lengthy\nlists.   It appears from a lay perspective that making targeted\ndisclosures of certain ingredients and ingredient groupings might\nbe a more effective public health strategy.\n\n                                     -45-\n\f            Because this is a crucial point, I wish to further\n\nclarify what I have just concluded above.                   I am not requiring\n\nMassachusetts to adopt the narrowest regulation possible to address\n\nits laudable goals.         Rather, the tobacco companies complain about\n\na    specific     element     of    the      Disclosure     Act,     namely,   that\n\nMassachusetts can publish their entire ingredient lists if doing so\n\n\"could\" further public health.                A prior holding, which is not\n\ncurrently       before    us,      decided       that   under      this   standard,\n\nMassachusetts      will   publish     the     tobacco     companies'      ingredient\n\nlists.18    Philip Morris III, 113 F. Supp. 2d 129.                  I simply find\n\nthat this actual publication, or right to publish, under the\n\nminimal standard set forth, has not been shown to further the\n\nstated goal of promoting public health in such a way as to\n\ncounterbalance the tremendous private loss involved. Therefore, it\n\nis clear that the character of the government action weighs heavily\n\nagainst sustaining the Disclosure Act.\n\n            iv.    Conclusion -- Regulatory takings analysis\n\n            As I conclude my analysis of the Penn Central factors, I\n\nfirst note that there is no formula as to how to weigh the\n\nimportance of the various factors.                 As has been clear from the\n\n\n18\n   Under Monsanto, if the tobacco companies were to submit their\ntrade secret information without any guarantee of confidentiality,\nthey would lose all right to complain later about disclosure. 467\nU.S. at 1006-07. Therefore, it is not actually dispositive that\nMassachusetts will disclose these lists. It is sufficient that the\ntobacco companies are on constructive notice that if they comply\nwith the Disclosure Act, their trade secrets may not remain secret.\n\n                                          -46-\n\fpreceding discussion, different factors can be dispositive.                See,\n\ne.g., Hodel, 481 U.S. at 716 (resting on the character of the\n\ngovernment regulation which the Court found to be \"extraordinary\");\n\nMonsanto,   467   U.S.   at    1005   (finding    the   lack   of    reasonable\n\ninvestment-backed expectations to be dispositive).\n\n            Here, the tobacco companies have at least some reasonable\n\ninvestment-backed expectation that their trade secrets will remain\n\nsecret and the economic impact of revelation is likely to be great.\n\nThese factors, alone, may not be sufficient to raise this case to\n\nthe level of an unconstitutional taking. However, the character of\n\nthe government action determines the case.               The Disclosure Act\n\ncauses the tobacco companies to lose their trade secrets, entirely,\n\nand appellants advance no convincing public policy rationale to\n\njustify the taking itself.            Instead, they point to a general,\n\nlaudable goal which cannot justify the specific action of which the\n\ntobacco companies complain.       Therefore, I find that the Disclosure\n\nAct violates the Takings Clause by taking appellees' property\n\nwithout just compensation.\n\n            This, unfortunately, does not completely end the inquiry.\n\nI must turn briefly to the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.\n\nC.   Unconstitutional Conditions\n\n            The   Disclosure    Act    is    unlike   some   other   challenged\n\ngovernment actions because the tobacco companies do not need to\n\ncede their ingredient lists to Massachusetts.                They can opt out\n\n\n                                      -47-\n\fentirely, simply by not selling their products in Massachusetts.19\n\nTherefore, their claim is really that Massachusetts has placed an\n\nunconstitutional condition on their right to sell their products in\n\nMassachusetts.    If the Disclosure Act simply required the tobacco\n\ncompanies    to   submit    their     ingredient    lists     for   possible\n\npublication, it would be unconstitutional.          The question then is\n\nwhether Massachusetts can constitutionally condition the right to\n\nsell tobacco products in Massachusetts on submission to this\n\nscheme.\n\n            The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions is fairly\n\nwell-developed. \"[T]he government may not require a person to give\n\nup   a   constitutional    right--here     the   right   to   receive   just\n\ncompensation when property is taken for public use--in exchange for\n\ndiscretionary benefit conferred by the government where the benefit\n\nsought has little or no relationship to the property.\"              Dolan v.\n\nCity of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 385 (1994).           Beyond these general\n\ncontours,   different     inquiries   have   developed      which   apply   to\n\n\n\n\n19\n   Apparently when faced with disclosure regulations previously,\nsome tobacco companies have simply withdrawn from those markets or\nreformulated the brands sold within those jurisdictions so as to\navoid disclosures of certain ingredients.     See Robert K. Hur,\nTakings, Trade Secrets, and Tobacco: Mountain or Molehill?, 53\nStan. L. Rev. 447, 488 (2000) (discussing the reaction of various\ntobacco companies to regulations imposed by Canada).\n\n                                    -48-\n\fdifferent types of property. In the case of intellectual property,\n\nMonsanto provides the relevant standard.20\n\n           In the final element of Monsanto, the Court addressed\n\nwhether the government could require pesticide manufacturers to\n\nsubmit trade     secrets    which    could    then       be   disclosed     to   other\n\nparties.     Monsanto claimed that these data disclosure provisions\n\ncreated an unconstitutional condition. Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1007.\n\nIn respect to this claim, the Court said \"as long as Monsanto is\n\naware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the\n\nconditions    are   rationally      related    to    a    legitimate      Government\n\ninterest, a     voluntary   submission        of    data      by   an   applicant   in\n\nexchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly\n\nbe called a taking.\"       Id.   This holding depended on the fact that\n\nMonsanto submitted its data in exchange for a valuable government\n\nbenefit: a registration.         See Nollan v. Cal. Coastal Comm’n, 483\n\nU.S. 825, 833 n.2 (1987) (\"[W]e found merely that the Takings\n\nClause was not violated by giving effect to the Government's\n\nannouncement that application for 'the right to [the] valuable\n\n\n20\n     The tobacco companies argue that there must be a \"rough\nproportionality\" between means and ends, a standard which has\npreviously been used in evaluating unconstitutional conditions\nclaims in the Takings Clause sphere.     Dolan, 512 U.S. at 391.\nHowever, the Supreme Court has only applied this standard in cases\nwhere the state requires land to be dedicated to public use in\nexchange for permits to develop other portions of the property.\nCity of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S.\n687, 702 (1999). Therefore, I elect to follow the path laid out in\nMonsanto, which is, factually, fairly analogous to the current\ncase.\n\n                                      -49-\n\fGovernment benefit,' of obtaining registration of an insecticide\n\nwould confer upon the Government a license to use and disclose the\n\ntrade secrets contained in the application.\" (citations omitted)).21\n\nTherefore, as part of a regulatory scheme which confers some\n\ngovernment benefit upon a manufacturer, Monsanto establishes that\n\nthe government may require that manufacturer to relinquish its\n\nrights to a trade secret.\n\n            Appellants argue that this holding governs here.                   I\n\ndisagree.      They     claim   that    Massachusetts   has     a    \"legitimate\n\nGovernment interest\" in protecting the health and safety of its\n\ncitizens. I agree that this is indeed a legitimate state interest.\n\nMy disagreement lies, rather, with the other side of the equation.\n\nThe state must offer a valuable government benefit.             Id. The right\n\noffered     here   is    the    right     to   sell   tobacco       products   in\n\nMassachusetts.        In Nollan, the Supreme Court considered what\n\nconstitutes such a benefit with regard to land.                 The Court held\n\nthat the right to build upon one's land is not such a benefit that\n\n\n\n21\n    When the panel addressed this question, the panel majority\nignored the Court's directive in Nollan. The majority justified\ntheir approach by noting that Nollan quotes a portion of the\nMonsanto opinion, which is actually a quotation from appellee\nMonsanto's brief.    See Nollan, 483 U.S. at 833 n.2; see also\nMonsanto, 467 U.S. at 1007.    This is an insufficient ground on\nwhich to ignore the Supreme Court's later clarification of the\nMonsanto holding. Just because the Supreme Court decides to adopt\na party's terminology does not mean that the Court's reasoning is\nnon-binding on this Court. We must still follow the lead of the\nSupreme Court whether the Justices blaze their own path or adopt a\nwell-reasoned argument presented to them.\n\n                                        -50-\n\fwould allow a state to require a landowner to grant a public\n\neasement across his property.          Id. at 833 n.2.      In contrast, in\n\nMonsanto, the government granted a license, created a de jure data-\n\nlicensing scheme, and established a period of exclusive use for new\n\ningredients in exchange for the right to disclose some trade\n\nsecrets.    467 U.S. at 994.       Applying these two precedents to our\n\ncase, I conclude that allowing a manufacturer to simply sell its\n\nlegal product is more similar to building on one's land than to the\n\ncomplex regulatory scheme in Monsanto.            Therefore, Massachusetts\n\ncannot condition the right to sell tobacco on the forfeiture of any\n\nconstitutional     protections   the    appellees    have   to   their   trade\n\nsecrets.    As a result, the Disclosure Act is invalid because it\n\ncreates    an   unconstitutional    taking   of   the   tobacco   companies'\n\nproducts.\n\n                                       V.\n\n                          Due Process Analysis\n\n            Because I find that the Disclosure Act is invalid under\n\nthe Takings Clause, I will not address the question of whether it\n\nalso violates the Due Process Clause.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -51-\n\f                                   VI.\n\n                                Conclusion\n\n          For   the   reasons    discussed   above,    I   find   that   the\n\nDisclosure Act violates the Takings Clause.           Therefore, I affirm\n\nthe district court's judgment.22\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                        \"Concurrence follows\"\n\n\n\n\n22\n   I note that normally injunctive relief is not available under\nthe Takings Clause. \"Equitable relief is not available to enjoin\nan alleged taking of private property for public use, duly\nauthorized by law, when a suit for compensation can be brought\nagainst the sovereign subsequent to the taking.\" Monsanto, 467\nU.S. at 1016.     However, appellants failed to object to the\nappropriateness of injunctive relief before this Court. Therefore,\nthey have waived this argument, see García-Ayala v. Lederle\nParenterals, Inc., 212 F.3d 638, 645 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that\nfailure to brief an argument constitutes waiver), and the\ninjunction stands.\n\n                                   -52-\n\f          SELYA, Circuit Judge (Concurring in the judgment).         I\n\nagree with the ultimate conclusion reached by Judge Torruella in\n\nthe lead opinion:    the Disclosure Act (section 307B) works a\n\nregulatory taking of the tobacco companies' trade secrets and, in\n\nthe bargain, places an unconstitutional condition on their right to\n\nconduct business in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.        I write\n\nseparately, however, because of my doubts about the analysis that\n\nthe lead opinion uses to reach that result.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Judge Torruella and I start on common ground: both of us\n\nacknowledge the primacy of the Supreme Court's treatment of trade\n\nsecret takings in Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986 (1984).\n\nAt that point, we part company.        The lead opinion uses Monsanto\n\nprimarily as a stepping stone for applying the regulatory takings\n\nanalysis derived in Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York\n\nCity, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978).        With respect, I think that this\n\napproach unnecessarily complicates the matter.\n\n          Having articulated my complete position on the relevance\n\nof Monsanto to the resolution of this case in Philip Morris, Inc.\n\nv. Harshbarger, 159 F.3d 670 (1st Cir. 1998) (Philip Morris II), no\n\nuseful purpose would be served by rehearsing that position here.\n\nI do need to point out, however, that after discussing trade secret\n\nprotection in Massachusetts and concluding (persuasively, in my\n\nview) not only that Massachusetts protects trade secrets but also\n\n\n                               -53-\n\fthat the Disclosure Act implicates the tobacco companies' property\n\ninterests in their trade secrets, the lead opinion misses the turn\n\nthat the Monsanto Court took to shorten traditional regulatory\n\ntakings analysis in the trade secret context.                     The Monsanto Court\n\nspecifically found that investment-backed expectations ancillary to\n\nsafeguarded trade secrets so \"overwhelm[ed]\" the other customarily\n\nconsidered    factors    as    to    \"dispose[]           of   the   taking   question\n\nregarding    those    data.\"        467       U.S.   at   1005.      The   Court    then\n\nconcluded,    without     addressing           either      the    character    of   the\n\ngovernmental action or its economic impact, that the government's\n\nuse or disclosure of data in which a trade secret holder had a\n\nreasonable      investment-backed                expectation         of       continued\n\nconfidentiality      constituted          a    taking     that    would    offend    the\n\nConstitution absent adequate compensation.                     Id. at 1013-14.\n\n            In light of this express guidance, I am at a loss as to\n\nwhy the lead opinion does not simply stop after concluding that\n\n\"the tobacco companies have at least some reasonable investment-\n\nbacked expectation that their trade secrets will remain secret.\"\n\nLead Op. at 47.      Instead, that opinion proceeds to undertake a full\n\nPenn Central analysis, makes a series of unnecessary sub-holdings,\n\nand concludes (erroneously, in my view) that the tobacco companies'\n\nreasonable investment-backed expectations, even when coupled with\n\nthe likelihood of great economic impact, \"may not be sufficient to\n\nraise this case to the level of an unconstitutional taking.\"                         Id.\n\n\n                                          -54-\n\fAlthough the lead opinion then reaches the right result by finding\n\nthe character of the governmental action to be determinative, id.\n\nat 47, I cannot reconcile this reasoning with Monsanto (which\n\nteaches that as long as a trade secret holder has a reasonable\n\ninvestment-backed expectation that its trade secrets will remain\n\nsecret, the sovereign's use or divulgement of that information\n\nconstitutes a taking for which the Constitution requires just\n\ncompensation).23\n\n             I might add that the lead opinion seems to assume that\n\nwhen Penn Central applies, stare decisis does not.    Id. at 20 n.5.\n\nI disagree.     In general -- the exceptions are inapposite here --\n\nthat doctrine obliges us to follow the most current Supreme Court\n\nprecedent.    The lead opinion's application of Penn Central ignores\n\nthe manner in which the Monsanto Court treated those factors in a\n\nmaterially indistinguishable situation.     Stare decisis does not\n\nallow such hopscotching.\n\n\n\n23\n    Contrary to the lead opinion's assertion, Lead Op. at 20 n.5,\nthis reading of Monsanto does not call into question the\nconstitutionality of regulations such as 15 U.S.C. § 2613(a)(3).\nAccording to the Monsanto formulation, an entity subject to such a\nregulatory scheme would not have a reasonable investment-backed\nexpectation that its trade secrets would remain secret if it\nsubmitted the information under circumstances meeting the statutory\ncriteria for government divulgence. Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1006.\nIn such instances, the statute provides fair warning, and the trade\nsecret holder can assess for itself the likelihood that the\ngovernment will reveal submitted information.          The tobacco\ncompanies, however, are not subject to a scheme of this type, nor\ndoes the Commonwealth argue that it presently publishes such\nstatutory or regulatory notice.\n\n                                 -55-\n\f              To be sure, the lead opinion purports to distinguish\n\nMonsanto on the ground that the Disclosure Act offers no promise of\n\nlong-term confidentiality whereas FIFRA -- the federal statutory\n\nscheme at issue in Monsanto -- contained such a guarantee.                  The\n\nlead   opinion    then     concludes    that   FIFRA's   explicit    guarantee\n\n\"established     a   reasonable      investment-backed     expectation     that\n\nMonsanto's trade secrets would remain protected.\"            Lead Op. at 31-\n\n32.    This reads Monsanto out of context.          Although the \"explicit\n\ngovernmental guarantee formed the basis of a reasonable investment-\n\nbacked expectation\" anent \"trade secrets [already] submitted under\n\nthe statutory regime in force,\" Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1011, state\n\nproperty law established those expectations with respect to trade\n\nsecrets generally, see id. at 1001.             Thus, \"to the extent that\n\nMonsanto ha[d] an interest in its health, safety, and environmental\n\ndata cognizable as a trade-secret property right under Missouri\n\nlaw, that property right [wa]s protected by the Taking Clause of\n\nthe Fifth Amendment.\"         Id. at 1003-04 (emphasis supplied).           The\n\npromise in Monsanto was dispositive because it preserved the trade\n\nsecret status, protected under state law, of data Monsanto had\n\nroutinely submitted to the government throughout the relevant\n\nperiod.   See id. at 1010-11.          In contrast, the tobacco companies\n\nhave    not    submitted     their     protected   trade   secrets    to   the\n\nCommonwealth. Were they to do so without extracting a guarantee of\n\n\n\n\n                                       -56-\n\fconfidentiality,24 they would have no trade secrets (and, thus, no\n\ntakings claim).\n\n            Viewed from this perspective, it is plain that Monsanto's\n\ntrade secrets were its to lose, regardless of how the FIFRA was\n\nwritten.    This is why the Court found no taking with respect to the\n\nperiods during which \"Monsanto [wa]s aware of the conditions under\n\nwhich the data [we]re submitted,\" yet submitted the data anyway.\n\nId. at 1007.      The question in Monsanto, therefore, was not simply\n\n\"whether    the   government    could    disclose    trade   secrets   it   had\n\npreviously agreed to keep secret.\"            Lead Op. at 32-33.   More aptly\n\nphrased, the question was whether the data Monsanto turned over to\n\nthe government were, in fact, still trade secrets in which Monsanto\n\nhad a property interest protected by the Takings Clause.                    See\n\nMonsanto,   467    U.S.   at   1000.     The    Court   answered   this   query\n\naffirmatively with respect to the data submitted during the 1972-78\n\nregime.25   See id. at 1013-14.\n\n\n24\n   As a practical matter, the tobacco companies cannot extract a\npromise of confidentiality from the Massachusetts legislature.\nThey can only challenge the constitutionality of the laws passed by\nthat august body.\n25\n    Consistent with this holding, Monsanto was not entitled to\ncompensation for the pre-1972 period. The data revealed during\nthat time frame did not fit the definition of a trade secret under\nstate law because \"the owner of the secret [did not] protect[] his\ninterest from disclosure to others.\" Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1002.\nAs to the post-1978 period, the government's use of submitted data\n\"in a manner that was authorized by law at the time of the\nsubmission\" was not unconstitutional because it was justly\ncompensated; Monsanto was fully aware of the conditions attendant\nto submitting the data and nonetheless did so voluntarily \"in\n\n                                       -57-\n\f             Reading this record in light of Monsanto, I conclude,\n\nwithout    serious   question,    that    the    tobacco      companies   have    a\n\nreasonable investment-backed expectation that their trade secrets\n\nwill remain secret before submission to the Commonwealth.                     After\n\nall, a secret remains a secret when not divulged, and there is no\n\nlaw that forces the tobacco companies to reveal their trade secrets\n\nto   the   Commonwealth    if    they     decide    to     withdraw    from     the\n\nMassachusetts market.      In the end, the tobacco companies are left\n\nwith a Hobson's choice:     either comply with the Disclosure Act and\n\nforfeit your valuable trade secrets or withdraw from the lucrative\n\nMassachusetts    market.        This    constitutes      an    unconstitutional\n\ncondition on the tobacco companies' right to sell their products in\n\nthe Commonwealth, see Philip Morris II, 159 F.3d at 678-79, and\n\nthey challenge the Disclosure Act under that theory.                  The tobacco\n\ncompanies apparently understand that they will no longer have a\n\nreasonable      investment-backed             expectation       of      continued\n\nconfidentiality once they knuckle under and submit to the statutory\n\nregime.    For that reason, they seek a preliminary injunction under\n\nthe theory that enforcement of the statute will constitute a\n\ntaking.\n\n\n\n\nexchange for the economic advantages of a registration.\" Id. at\n1007. Thus, it was Monsanto's own actions, silhouetted against the\nbackdrop of state property law, that determined whether it\nmaintained a reasonable investment-backed expectation of continued\ntrade secret confidentiality.\n\n                                       -58-\n\f           It is possible, of course, that the lead opinion is\n\nasking whether the owner of any trade secret that raises public\n\nhealth and safety concerns has a reasonable investment-backed\n\nexpectation of continued secrecy in the absence of regulatory or\n\nstatutory notice.    If so, the answer is \"yes\" -- according to no\n\nless an authority than Monsanto. Unlike the lead opinion, Lead Op.\n\nat 43-46, the Monsanto Court did not weigh the character of the\n\ngovernment action to determine if it was tailored to achieve a\n\nlaudable goal.    Instead, the Court, even after acknowledging the\n\n\"mounting public concern about the safety\" of the products at\n\nissue, 467 U.S. at 991, found that government revelation of a trade\n\nsecret in which the owner had a reasonable investment-backed\n\nexpectation of continued confidentiality would be a taking (absent\n\njust   compensation),    id.     at   1013-14.       In   the   last   analysis,\n\nMassachusetts is free to pursue its praiseworthy goals in any\n\nlawful manner -- but if it chooses to enforce the Disclosure Act in\n\nits present form, it will have to compensate the tobacco companies\n\nfor expropriating their trade secrets.             See id.\n\n                                      II.\n\n           I have another doubt about the lead opinion's approach.\n\nThat opinion     gives   short    shrift     to   the   possibility    that   the\n\nDisclosure Act works a per se taking.             See Lead Op. at 23-26.      But\n\nper se takings analysis warrants very serious consideration in\n\nregard to the expropriation of trade secrets.\n\n\n                                      -59-\n\f          I need not wax longiloquent here, preferring instead, in\n\nthe interest of brevity, to reiterate what I said in my dissent to\n\nthe original panel opinion (now withdrawn).     See Philip Morris,\n\nInc. v. Reilly, Nos. 00-2425, 00-2449, slip op. at 50-56 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (Selya, J., dissenting), available at 2001 WL 1215365.\n\nSimply put, I see no principled reason to refrain from extending\n\nper se takings analysis to alleged takings of trade secrets.\n\nIndeed, the Supreme Court hinted at this result when it observed\n\nthat the term \"property\" in the Takings Clause is meant in its\n\n\"more accurate sense to denote the group of rights inhering in the\n\ncitizen's relation to the physical thing\" as opposed to its \"vulgar\n\nand untechnical sense of the physical thing\" itself. Monsanto, 467\n\nU.S. at 1003 (quoting United States v. Gen. Motors Corp., 323 U.S.\n\n373, 377-78 (1945)).\n\n          The Court further elucidated the conceptual nature of\n\nrights in physical property in Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council,\n\nInc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 122 S. Ct. 1465 (2002).\n\nThere, the Court reasoned that an \"interest in real property is\n\ndefined by the metes and bounds that describe its geographic\n\ndimensions and the term of years that describes the temporal aspect\n\nof the owner's interest.\"   Id. at 1484.   Realistically, however,\n\nsuch \"property\" exists principally in the minds of legal theorists;\n\nto the archetypical landowner, such concepts are meaningless unless\n\nand until the integrity of her rights are challenged.   In my view,\n\n\n                               -60-\n\fthis illustrates that property rights, in general, consist largely\n\nof legal fictions, and exist only to the extent that they are\n\nrecognized and enforceable in court -- and that verity holds true\n\nwhether   the     subject   matter   they   encompass    is   corporeal   or\n\nconceptual.\n\n           This     point   is   further    supported   by    comparing   the\n\nvaluation of real and intellectual property.            The basis of value\n\nfor both is the owner's right to exclude (relative to others'\n\ndemand for access).     For example, it is obvious that, other things\n\nbeing equal, ten acres of undeveloped land in rural Maine is not as\n\nvaluable as ten acres of undeveloped land in midtown Manhattan. If\n\nthe physical thing itself were the basis of value, these tracts of\n\nequal size and topographical characteristics should be worth the\n\nsame. The value differential results from the fact that people are\n\nwilling to pay a higher price for access to Manhattan.              Cf. The\n\nExecutive's Book of Quotations 168 (Oxford Univ. Press 1994)\n\n(citing the \"[l]ong-standing real estate principle\" of \"[l]ocation,\n\nlocation, location\").       So too trade secrets:       if I have a secret\n\nformula for, say, prune juice, people presumably will not be\n\nwilling to pay as high a price for the secret as they would for a\n\nsecret recipe for making Marlboro cigarettes.\n\n          In short, the value of trade secrets, like the value of\n\nland, is inextricably tied to both the demand of others for access\n\nand the legal enforceability of the owner's right to exclude.             In\n\n\n                                     -61-\n\feither case, if the right to exclude is diminished, the value\n\ndecreases.      And in either case, if the sovereign effectively\n\ndeprives the owner of the right to exclude, the value is destroyed\n\n-- and the Constitution requires just compensation.           Limiting per\n\nse takings analysis to cases involving real property is a crude\n\nboundary with no compelling basis in the law.           We should not be\n\nhesitant to take the next logical step when justice demands it.26\n\n                                    III.\n\n             I need go no further.    Even the most laconic observer of\n\nthe Supreme Court's Takings Clause jurisprudence knows that the\n\n\"question of what constitutes a 'taking' is one with which th[e]\n\nCourt has wrestled on many occasions.\" Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1004.\n\nAgainst that chiaroscuro backdrop, it should be no surprise if\n\njurists who agree on a conclusion disagree on the best route to get\n\nthere. Although our reasoning differs, I welcome Judge Torruella's\n\narrival   at   our   common    destination   and   gladly   concur   in   the\n\njudgment.\n\n\n\n                              \"Dissent follows\"\n\n\n\n26\n   The lead opinion reads Monsanto as confining its analysis to\nregulatory takings rather than extending per se rules to trade\nsecrets. Lead Op. at 20-23. But actions speak louder than words.\nOnce the Monsanto Court found that the trade secret holder\npossessed a reasonable investment-backed expectation in its trade\nsecrets, the Court determined that such a taking, if not justly\ncompensated, would be unconstitutional.    Monsanto, 467 U.S. at\n1013-14. This treatment mirrors a per se takings analysis.\n\n                                    -62-\n\f                LIPEZ, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).

However,\n\nI believe that reasoning compels the conclusion that the Disclosure\n\nAct   is    not     unconstitutional    on    its   face.

As\n\nJudge Torruella's opinion indicates, the constitutionality of any\n\ngiven disclosure under the Act depends on how much -- and what sort\n\nof -- ingredient information is made public.             The question of what\n\ninformation will be publicized cannot be answered by reference to\n\nthe terms of the Act and its implementing regulations, which\n\nindicate     only   that     Massachusetts     may   disclose    some   of    the\n\ninformation it receives.         Thus, there is nothing unconstitutional\n\nabout the Act itself.         What matters is how it is applied in each\n\nindividual case.\n\n                                        A.\n\n             Judge Torruella reasons that publication of the tobacco\n\ncompanies' \"entire ingredient lists\" constitutes a taking under the\n\nad hoc balancing test mandated by Penn Central Transportation Co.\n\nv. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104 (1978).                 Although I do not\n\nbelieve    we    need   to   decide   that    question   here,   I   agree   that\n\ndisclosure of the tobacco companies' entire ingredient lists almost\n\ncertainly would \"go[] too far,\" Penn. Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S.\n\n393, 415 (1922), and therefore would rise to the level of a taking.\n\nSuch a disclosure would come at an enormous cost, as it would\n\n\"completely destroy\" the secrecy of the companies' brand-specific\n\nformulas.       On the other side of the equation, \"it is not at all\n\n\n                                       -64-\n\fclear   that   protecting    the   overall        integrity   of    the   tobacco\n\ncompanies'     ingredient    lists\"    --    by   publicizing      only   certain\n\ningredients, for example -- would \"interfere with Massachusetts'\n\ngoal of promoting public health.\" Accordingly, it seems reasonable\n\nto conclude, as Judge Torruella does, that disclosure of the\n\ntobacco companies' entire ingredient lists would constitute a\n\ntaking for which compensation is due.\n\n             Judge Torruella recognizes, however, that a more limited\n\ndisclosure likely would not suffer from the same constitutional\n\ninfirmities.     Thus, he acknowledges that the tobacco companies\n\n\"comply, without complaint, with regimes which require them to make\n\nconfidential disclosures of brand-specific, ingredient information,\n\nsee Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 161.351-55, or which require\n\npublic disclosures when specific ingredients are used, see Minn.\n\nStat. § 461.17.\" Judge Torruella observes that ingredient-specific\n\ndisclosure, such as that required under Minnesota law, not only\n\nadequately serves the state's interest in protecting public health,\n\nbut actually does so more effectively than the across-the-board\n\ndisclosure permitted under the Disclosure Act.\n\n           Implicit in Judge Torruella's opinion, therefore, is the\n\nview that the outcome of the Penn Central analysis depends on\n\nwhether Massachusetts publicizes the tobacco companies' entire\n\ningredient     lists,   or   whether    it    engages   in    a    more   limited\n\ndisclosure.     I agree.      If Massachusetts were to disclose only\n\n\n                                      -65-\n\fcertain harmful ingredients, the economic burden on the companies\n\nwould be significantly reduced.          Although the fact that brand X\n\ncontains ingredient Y may be a secret, the tobacco companies do not\n\nallege that the disclosure of such limited information would permit\n\ntheir competitors to discover and recreate brand-specific formulas.\n\nThey   reserve   that    charge    for   a   disclosure      of    their    entire\n\ningredient lists, organized by relative amount on a brand-by-brand\n\nbasis.\n\n            Moreover, a more limited disclosure undeniably would\n\nserve the state's goal of protecting public health.                Under current\n\nlaw, the federal Department of Health and Human Services \"can study\n\nand report to Congress on the health effects of tobacco additives,\n\nincluding information on specific ingredients which may pose a\n\nhealth risk to consumers.\" However, neither the federal government\n\nnor -- as of yet -- most states, can inform consumers about the\n\npresence of harmful ingredients in specific brands.                       As Judge\n\nTorruella recognizes, Massachusetts has a \"significant\" interest in\n\npromoting the health of its citizens, and its desire to help\n\nconsumers     make    informed    choices    about     tobacco      products      is\n\n\"laudable.\"      If    Massachusetts     were   to    pursue      those    ends   by\n\ndisclosing    brand-specific      information        about     certain     harmful\n\ningredients, I believe the force of the state's interests would\n\noutweigh the costs to the tobacco companies in the balance of\n\n\n\n\n                                     -66-\n\ffactors.     See Keystone Bituminous Coal Ass'n, 480 U.S. at 488.\n\nNothing in Judge Torruella's opinion suggests otherwise.\n\n                                     B.\n\n            Thus,   under   Judge    Torruella's   own     reasoning,   the\n\nDisclosure Act will effect an unconstitutional taking only if\n\nMassachusetts discloses the tobacco companies' entire ingredient\n\nlists.     It follows that, in order to hold that the Disclosure Act\n\nis unconstitutional on its face, we would have to conclude that it\n\nmandates such broad disclosure in every case, or at least a \"large\n\nfraction\" of them.     Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 895\n\n(1992). However, the Act does not require disclosure of the entire\n\ningredient lists.      It says only that Massachusetts \"shall\" make\n\npublic certain \"information\" contained in those lists if the State\n\nDepartment of Health determines that publicizing \"such information\"\n\ncould reduce risks to public health.           Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94,\n\n§ 307B (2002).\n\n             Notwithstanding the express terms of the Act, Judge\n\nTorruella proceeds on the assumption that Massachusetts necessarily\n\nwill disclose the tobacco companies' entire ingredient lists.            He\n\njustifies that assumption by reference to the district court's\n\nopinion, stating that \"[a] prior holding, which is not currently\n\nbefore us, decided that under [the Disclosure Act], Massachusetts\n\nwill   publish   the   tobacco   companies'   ingredient    lists.\"     The\n\ndistrict court decided no such thing.         To the contrary, the court\n\n\n                                    -67-\n\fexplicitly acknowledged Massachusetts's argument that \"the DPH may\n\ndetermine that the public health will be served by disclosure of\n\nonly some of the ingredients on a list, not a whole list.\"27       Philip\n\nMorris III, 113 F. Supp. 2d at 139 n.27.              It held only that\n\nMassachusetts was bound to disclose some of the information in the\n\ntobacco companies' ingredient lists.\n\n           Perhaps recognizing the limited nature of the district\n\ncourt's holding, Judge Torruella emphasizes that the Act \"allows\n\nfor\" disclosure of the full ingredient lists.              But the mere\n\npossibility of such broad disclosure is not enough to render the\n\nAct facially invalid.    See Agins v. Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 259-60\n\n(1980) (rejecting, in the context of a facial challenge, the\n\nargument that the zoning ordinance at issue could be applied to\n\nprohibit   all   development,   where   the   terms   of   the   ordinance\n\n\n\n27\n    Although the district court did not question the accuracy of\nthat argument, it rejected Massachusetts's claim that the\npossibility of partial disclosure rendered the tobacco companies'\ntakings claims unripe. See Philip Morris III, 113 F. Supp. 2d at\n139 n.27. I agree that those claims are ripe for review. Indeed,\nthe Supreme Court has explained that a facial challenge such as\nthis one typically is ripe \"the moment the challenged regulation or\nordinance is passed.\" Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 520\nU.S. 725, 736 n.10 (1997). Accordingly, I agree that the tobacco\ncompanies' facial challenge is properly before us. As I explain in\nthe text, however, I think that challenge fails on the merits. See\nYee, 503 U.S. at 534 (concluding that facial, but not as-applied,\ntakings challenge was ripe, and rejecting it on the merits); Hodel\nv. Va. Surface Mining & Reclamation Ass'n, Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 295-\n97 (1981) (same); Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 225, 260\n(1980) (same); see also Kines v. Day, 754 F.2d 28, 29-31 (1st Cir.\n1985) (same, with respect to facial and as-applied challenges under\nthe First Amendment (citing similar cases)).\n\n                                 -68-\n\fpermitted appellants to construct up to five residences on their\n\nproperty); see also United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745\n\n(1987)     (\"The    fact   that    [a    legislative       act]     might    operate\n\nunconstitutionally under some conceivable set of circumstances is\n\ninsufficient to render it wholly invalid . . . .\").                     Rather, the\n\nfact that the Disclosure Act may result in a taking in certain\n\ncircumstances -- if Massachusetts decides to publish the tobacco\n\ncompanies' entire ingredient lists, for example -- means only that\n\nthe companies might well succeed in as-applied challenges to the\n\nAct.     See Tahoe-Sierra, 122 S. Ct. at 1485 (\"[I]f petitioners had\n\nchallenged the application of the moratoria to their individual\n\nparcels, instead of making a facial challenge, some of them might\n\nhave prevailed under a Penn Central analysis.\"); see also McGuire\n\nv. Reilly, 260 F.3d 36, 47 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"If, as the plaintiffs\n\npredict,    experience     shows    that      clinic     staffers    in     fact    are\n\nutilizing the exemption as a means either of proselytizing or of\n\nengaging in preferential pro-choice advocacy, the plaintiffs remain\n\nfree to challenge the Act, as applied, in a concrete factual\n\nsetting.\").\n\n                                         C.\n\n            Judge    Torruella     also       suggests    that    the     fact     that\n\nMassachusetts has the right to publish the entire ingredient lists\n\nrenders the Act facially invalid because the mere possibility of\n\ndisclosure is enough to put the companies on \"constructive notice\n\n\n                                        -69-\n\fthat if they comply with the Disclosure Act, their trade secrets\n\nmay not remain secret.\"    Since the Act makes clear that the state\n\nmight disclose trade secret information, the argument goes, the\n\ncompanies cannot submit their information to the state and then\n\nlater    claim   that   any   proposed      public     dissemination    is\n\nunconstitutional. On that view, if the tobacco companies choose to\n\nrun the risk of such public dissemination in order to continue\n\ndoing business in the state, they \"can hardly argue that [their]\n\nreasonable   investment-backed   expectations        are   disturbed   when\n\n[Massachusetts] acts to . . . disclose the data in a manner that\n\nwas authorized by law at the time of submission.\"           Ruckelshaus v.\n\nMonsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1006-07 (1984).\n\n           I do not think the choice is so stark.              Unlike the\n\nregulatory scheme at issue in Monsanto, the Disclosure Act contains\n\nmechanisms by which the tobacco companies can protect their trade\n\nsecrets from public dissemination even after submitting them to the\n\nstate.   If Massachusetts proposes to publicize any or all of the\n\ninformation contained in a tobacco company's annual report, the\n\ncompany can stay disclosure by filing an as-applied challenge in a\n\ncourt of competent jurisdiction.        See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105,\n\n§ 660.200(G) (1999).    In the alternative -- or in the event such a\n\nchallenge fails -- the company can withdraw its products from the\n\nMassachusetts market.     See id. § 660.200(F).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -70-\n\f            Nor   do   I   agree   that     future   as-applied   challenges\n\nnecessarily will fail because the tobacco companies' right to\n\nprotect the confidentiality of their trade secrets will dissolve\n\nthe moment they submit those secrets to the state.             Under the Act\n\nand   its   implementing     regulations,       a    public   disclosure   is\n\n\"authorized by law,\" Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1007, only if the\n\ntobacco companies do not exercise their right to stay disclosure by\n\nfiling a timely challenge in court.         See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105,\n\n§ 660.200(G)(2).       Indeed, the regulations state explicitly that\n\nMassachusetts \"shall treat [the ingredient lists] as confidential\n\nunless and until . . . a determination to release the information\n\nhas been made in accordance with [the Disclosure Act] . . . and no\n\ncomplaint has been filed in a court of competent jurisdiction\n\nchallenging disclosure of the information on the grounds that\n\ndisclosure would make available to the public a trade secret.\" Id.\n\nThus, Massachusetts's ability to disclose the tobacco companies'\n\ntrade secrets is expressly conditioned on the companies' right to\n\nresist any such disclosure through an as-applied challenge.                It\n\nwould border on the absurd to reject such a challenge on the ground\n\nthat the tobacco companies had \"implicitly consented\" to the very\n\ndisclosure being resisted.         Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1021 (O'Connor,\n\nJ., concurring in part).\n\n            In sum, I disagree with Judge Torruella's conclusion that\n\nthe Disclosure Act is facially unconstitutional because it requires\n\n\n                                     -71-\n\ftobacco companies to submit their trade secrets to the state\n\nwithout   any    guarantees    of    confidentiality.     The   implementing\n\nregulations contain an unambiguous promise of confidentiality.\n\nTherefore, the initial act of submission to the state is not enough\n\nto destroy the value of the trade secrets.            It is only when those\n\nsecrets actually are made available to the public that the tobacco\n\ncompanies' property interest dissolves. That, of course, brings us\n\nback to where we began:         the relevant event for purposes of the\n\nTakings Clause is the actual (or imminent) disclosure of the\n\ntobacco companies' trade secrets.            As I explained above -- and as\n\nJudge Torruella appears to recognize -- the constitutionality of\n\nany given disclosure depends on how much, and what sort of,\n\ninformation Massachusetts proposes to make public.              Accordingly,\n\nthe Act is not unconstitutional in every application, and the\n\ntobacco companies' facial challenge should fail.\n\n                               II.   DUE PROCESS\n\n              The tobacco companies also argue that the Disclosure Act\n\ndenies them due process of law by permitting the state to destroy\n\nthe   value     of   their   trade   secrets    without   an   adequate   pre-\n\ndeprivation hearing.         I agree that the Disclosure Act authorizes\n\nthe state to deprive the tobacco companies of a protected property\n\ninterest in their trade secrets.          However, I find no merit in the\n\ntobacco companies' contention that the Act fails to meet the\n\nstandards of the Due Process Clause.\n\n\n                                      -72-\n\f            As explained above, Massachusetts has enacted several\n\nregulations that contain important procedural safeguards.                     Under\n\nthe regulations, Massachusetts must provide the tobacco companies\n\nsixty days' written notice prior to publicizing any information in\n\nthe ingredient lists.          Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105, § 660.200(E).\n\nDuring     that    period,     the   tobacco   companies    may   comment       on\n\nMassachusetts's decision to disseminate the information.                  Id. at\n\n§ 660.200(A).       Moreover, the tobacco companies may forestall any\n\nthreatened disclosure by filing a lawsuit in a court of competent\n\njurisdiction.       Id. at § 660.200(G)(2).\n\n            Notwithstanding          the   unambiguous     language      of    the\n\nregulations, the tobacco companies complain that the Act fails to\n\n\"provide    a     meaningful   opportunity     for   judicial   review    before\n\nvaluable trade secrets concededly worth millions of dollars are\n\ndisclosed and destroyed.\"             In a footnote, they add that the\n\nprotections provided in § 660.200(G) -- which delays any proposed\n\ndisclosure until the completion of the sixty day notice period\n\nand/or any timely-filed lawsuit28 -- are inadequate because \"[t]he\n\n\n28\n     The regulations state, in pertinent part:\n\n      (G) The Department shall treat information submitted\n      pursuant to 105 CMR 660.101 as confidential unless and\n      until:\n           ...\n           (2) a determination to release the information is\n      made in accordance with 105 CMR 660.200(A) through (E),\n      the 60 day period referred to in 105 CMR 660.200(E) has\n      elapsed, and no complaint has been filed in a court of\n      competent jurisdiction challenging disclosure of the\n\n                                       -73-\n\fAct itself states that ingredient information 'shall be' a public\n\nrecord after the statutory determinations are made, and as such its\n\nproduction may be compelled by third parties regardless of the\n\n'pull back' option.\"    That is plainly incorrect.     Although reports\n\nsubmitted by the tobacco companies become public records by the\n\nterms of the Disclosure Act, that same Act states that \"before any\n\npublic   disclosure,\"    the   department   must    undertake   certain\n\nprocedures to ensure that the information being released to the\n\npublic will not violate the Takings Clause.        These procedures are\n\ndescribed both in the statute and in the regulations enacted\n\npursuant to it.   The department must abide by these procedures in\n\nconsidering its own disclosure under the Disclosure Act or in\n\n\n\n\n     information on the grounds that disclosure would make\n     available to the public a trade secret; [or]\n          (3) disclosure of the information is authorized by\n     judicial decision and the time for appeal in a court of\n     competent jurisdiction has passed;\n     ...\n     (H) In the event that a manufacturer files a complaint in\n     a court of competent jurisdiction within the 60 day\n     notice   period   specified   in  105   CMR   660.200(E),\n     challenging a proposed disclosure of information by the\n     Department on the grounds that disclosure would make\n     available to the public a trade secret, the Department\n     shall not disclose any of the information in question\n     unless and until:\n          (1) the parties agree in writing to disclosure; or\n          (2) the court renders a decision authorizing\n     disclosure; and\n          (3) the time has passed for filing an appeal of the\n     decision in a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nMass. Regs. Code tit. 105, § 660.200.\n\n                                 -74-\n\fresponding to requests for information from third parties under the\n\npublic records law, Mass. Gen. Laws, ch. 66, § 10(b).\n\n          The   tobacco       companies      argue      that    the    regulatory\n\namendments setting forth the \"pull-back\" option, § 660.200(G)(2),\n\nwill not preclude a third party from compelling inspection under\n\nthe public records law because the regulations contravene the terms\n\nof the Disclosure Act.      That is not so.          \"An administrative agency\n\nhas jurisdiction to establish regulations that bear a rational\n\nrelation to the statutory purpose.\" Globe News. Co. v. Beacon Hill\n\nArchitectural Comm., 659 N.E.2d 710, 717 (Mass. 1996).                   Although\n\nthe Disclosure Act contemplates the possibility that information\n\nsubmitted by the companies may be disclosed to the public, it also\n\ncontains provisions intended to protect the state from engaging in\n\nunconstitutional activity.       The statute requires the department to\n\n\"request the    advice   of    the   attorney        general\"   on    whether   the\n\nintended disclosure \"would constitute an unconstitutional taking of\n\nproperty.\"   Mass.   Gen.     Laws   ch.    94   §   307B.      The   \"pull-back\"\n\nregulations provide an extra layer of protection by allowing the\n\ntobacco companies to seek a judicial determination of the same\n\nquestion before there is any disclosure.              The Legislature's intent\n\nin addressing the takings issue is apparent -- at no point should\n\nthe department engage in any action that would violate the Takings\n\nClause.   Instead of contradicting the statute, as the companies\n\n\n\n\n                                     -75-\n\fargue, the regulations actually serve the unmistakable intent of\n\nthe Legislature.29\n\n          Therefore, it simply is not true that, notwithstanding\n\nthe regulations, \"third parties\" will be able to compel disclosure\n\nof the tobacco companies' trade secrets under Massachusetts's\n\npublic records statute.   As the Commonwealth argued in its briefs,\n\n\"the Disclosure Act actually limits the pre-existing reach of the\n\npublic records law, by providing that tobacco ingredients can be\n\nmade public only if the Act's conditions are met.\"       Thus, the\n\ntobacco companies will have an opportunity for \"meaningful judicial\n\nreview\" prior to any threatened deprivation.     Their due process\n\nchallenge fails on its own terms.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n29\n   Although the Disclosure Act explicitly states that the annual\nreports submitted by the tobacco companies pursuant to the Act are\npublic records, the additional provisions of the Act and the\nsupplemental regulations barring disclosure until there is\ncompliance with certain procedures produces a result that is\ncomparable to the result contemplated by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 4,\n§ 7, cl. 26(a) of the public records law. Under that subsection,\nmaterials or data \"specifically or by necessary implication\nexempted from disclosure by statute\" will not be considered public\nrecords, and therefore, are not open to inspection by the public.\nSee Ottaway News.

The district court held the statute to violate the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments by effecting an uncompensated taking, the Due Process Clause, and the Commerce Clause, and entered a permanent injunction. We have jurisdiction over this appeal and reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs-appellees are manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (the Manufacturers).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Since the late 1970s, when consumers began demanding lower tar and nicotine levels, the Manufacturers have increased the number of additives, other than tobacco, in their products, ostensibly to offset the lost flavor and taste. Today the Manufacturers report using approximately 700 additives, many of which are the focus of public health officials' concern. The Manufacturers assert that these additives, besides improving taste, flavor and aroma, serve as solvents, processing aids, and pH modifiers, and also fulfill other chemical functions. Each brand contains a combination of ingredients that substantially contributes to its distinctiveness and thus its competitive success. As such a formula gives a manufacturer a competitive advantage over other manufacturers who cannot, given the current state of technology, mimic it, the Manufacturers have invested many millions of dollars in creating their distinctive blends and take extensive precautions to protect the identity of the ingredients from disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal law requires the Manufacturers to submit to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) an aggregate list of ingredients used in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, without identification of the relevant manufacturer or brand or disclosure of quantities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Thus, although the lists compiled under the federal statutes are voluminous, they do not identify the ingredients (or the amounts) used in any particular brand nor do they enable public health experts to research how these ingredients might impact health when combined in particular amounts with others. See E.R. at 516 (Letter from David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D., Director of Centers for Disease Control, to Congress (\"Many of the approximately 700 ingredients added to tobacco could be causes of diseases or potential adverse health effects, if a sufficiently high dose is ingested. . . . [W]e do not know what potentially harmful byproducts may be produced when tobacco additives are burned alone or in combination, as they are in cigarettes.\")). In 1996, responding to what it perceived as this very problem, the Massachusetts legislature enacted the Massachusetts Tobacco Ingredients and Nicotine Yield Act (the Disclosure Act), the law at issue here. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, &#167; 307B (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Disclosure Act requires each manufacturer to provide the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) with an annual report listing, for each brand, \"the identity of any added constituent . . . in descending order according to weight, measure, or numerical count.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Disclosure Act further provides that both the brand's ingredient list and nicotine yield rating (the estimated amount of nicotine an average consumer would ingest when using the product) \"shall\" become a public record if two conditions are met. First, DPH must determine that \"there is a reasonable scientific basis for concluding that the availability of such information could reduce risks to public health.\" See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105, &#167;&#167; 660.200(A)-(C). Second, the Massachusetts Attorney General must advise DPH that the public release of the information would not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property. Id. 105, &#167;&#167; 660.200(D)-(E). The regulations require DPH to give the manufacturer sixty days' written notice of the information to be disclosed if the Attorney General decides that disclosure would not be a taking. Id. &#167; 660.200(E). The manufacturer may then cease sales in Massachusetts or remove the product from the Massachusetts market in order to reformulate it without the constituent(s) identified as problematic by DPH. Id. &#167; 660.200(F). Under a 1999 amendment to the regulations, all information provided to DPH is to remain confidential unless and until: (1) the manufacturer notifies DPH in writing that it does not consider the additive information it has submitted to be confidential; (2) sixty days has elapsed since DPH notified the manufacturer of the information to be disclosed and no complaint has been filed in a court of competent jurisdiction challenging disclosure on the grounds that it would make public a trade secret; (3) disclosure is authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction and the time for appeal has elapsed; or (4) disclosure is authorized by agreement of the parties. Id. &#167; 660.200(G).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Disclosure Act will enable DPH to study additives and the potential synergistic effects of certain ingredients in particular brands to determine whether they present health risks. If the requirements for public disclosure are met, DPH will be able to inform consumers whether a particular brand contains ingredients it has determined to be associated with adverse health effects, including enhanced nicotine delivery. In particular, it will be able to inform consumers whether the designation of several brands as \"light\" or \"ultra light\" (based upon estimates of low tar and nicotine delivery under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) machine testing method) is misleading. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44,970-79, 974 (Aug. 28, 1996) (noting that the Food and Drug Administration has found that \"the actual nicotine delivery to the smoker from some brands may be higher than the FTC yield because of the addition of ammonia or similar compounds to increase free nicotine\"); see also 61 Fed. Reg. 45,108-16 (Aug. 28, 1996) (detailing similar manipulation of nicotine delivery in smokeless tobacco). Even in the absence of public disclosure, DPH's study of additive safety could provide valuable information contributing to public health.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Texas has also enacted legislation requiring brand-specific reporting of ingredients.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 161.351-.355 (1999). The Texas statute obligates the Manufacturers to report the same information required by the Disclosure Act, but, like the federal statutes which require the Secretary of DHHS to treat the submitted information as \"trade secret or confidential information,\" see 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1335a(b)(2)(A); 15 U.S.C. &#167; 4403(b)(2)(A), the Texas statute provides explicit protection for trade secrets. See Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &#167; 161.354(d) (1999). It is the absence of such protection in the Disclosure Act, and the consequences that may ensue, that impel the Manufacturers' challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manufacturers initially filed this action in the fall of 1996. In separate suits which were later consolidated, the cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies claimed that the statute was preempted by federal law and that it ran afoul of the Takings Clause, the Commerce Clause, and the Due Process Clause. On February 7, 1997, the district court held that the Disclosure Act was not preempted by either the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331-41, or the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4401-08. After granting interlocutory review, this court affirmed. Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger (\"Philip Morris I\"), 122 F.3d 58 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1997, the Manufacturers moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the Disclosure Act's ingredient-reporting requirements. In December 1997, the district court, finding that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their taking claim and that they faced irreparable harm, enjoined the Commonwealth from enforcing these provisions. On interlocutory appeal, we once again affirmed. Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger (\"Philip Morris II\"), 159 F.3d 670 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1998, all parties filed summary judgment motions, and on September 7, 2000, the district court granted the Manufacturers' motions and denied the Commonwealth's. Finding that the ingredient-reporting provisions of the Disclosure Act would effect an uncompensated taking of the Manufacturers' trade secrets in violation of the Fifth Amendment, would impose an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, and would deny the Manufacturers due process by depriving them of a meaningful opportunity to argue against publication of their trade secrets prior to public release, the court permanently enjoined the Commonwealth from enforcing those provisions of the Disclosure Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The Commonwealth timely filed this appeal, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p>RIPENESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth first contends that this case is not ripe for review. Relying on Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), it argues that regulatory taking claims are not ripe until the government agency charged with implementing the challenged law has made a final decision about the application of the law to the property in question. Because DPH has not determined whether or to what extent to publicly release the ingredient lists, it argues, there has been no final decision with regard to disclosure of the Manufacturers' trade secrets and thus preenforcement review is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling on ripeness, the district court focused on the statute. With regard to the first condition to disclosure--that DPH determine that \"there is a reasonable scientific basis for concluding that the availability of such information could reduce risks to public health\"--the court found this threshold so low that an affirmative answer was all but a foregone conclusion. With regard to the second--that the Attorney General advise that disclosure would not constitute an unconstitutional taking--the court found that, given the Attorney General's position in this litigation, there was no question as to what his advice would be. Thus, the court concluded, there was no need for further \"ripening\" of the issues or factual development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point of the ripeness inquiry is primarily \"to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.\" Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148 (1967). We apply a two-part test to assess ripeness. See Stern v. United States District Court for the District of Mass., 214 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 2000). First, we must determine whether the issue presented is fit for judicial review--\"an inquiry that 'typically involves subsidiary queries concerning finality, definiteness, and the extent to which resolution of the challenge depends on facts that may not yet be sufficiently developed.'\" Id. (quoting Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d 530, 535 (1st Cir. 1995)). Second, we must evaluate the extent to which passing on the issue will impose hardship--\"an inquiry that 'typically turns upon whether the challenged action creates a \"direct and immediate\" dilemma for the parties.'\" Id. (quoting W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. EPA, 959 F.2d 360, 364 (1st Cir. 1992) (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first prong, the Commonwealth argues that the district court erred in treating disclosure as a foregone conclusion. We disagree. The Disclosure Act's accompanying regulations define the terms \"could reduce the risks to public health\" to mean \"that knowledge about an added constituent could result in reduced risk of adverse health effects associated with tobacco use, including but not limited to nicotine addiction and adverse health effects associated with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.\" Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105, &#167; 660.003. We agree with the district court that, given this low threshold, it is likely that at least with respect to some ingredients or combination of ingredients, DPH would find that there is a reasonable scientific basis to conclude that disclosure could reduce health risks, and hence that a recommendation in favor of disclosure is a probability. As for the Attorney General's resolution of the taking issue, here, too, we agree with the district court that, given his position in this litigation, it is predictable once the DPH makes the requisite determination based on reasonable scientific evidence. See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 151-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth argues that because a 1999 amendment to the regulations would require a stay of public disclosure if the Manufacturers filed a complaint, see Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105, &#167; 660.200(g)(2), disclosure is not inevitable. Whether this amendment will be effective has yet to be determined by the state courts. However, the Disclosure Act itself states that ingredient information \"shall be\" public records after DPH and the Attorney General have performed their respective tasks, and as a public record, its production and disclosure could be compelled, notwithstanding a claim to trade secret protection, by anyone requesting it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Moreover, the Manufacturers' taking claim is not limited to public disclosure by DPH. They contend that the required submission of ingredient information itself impairs their trade secrets because DPH has failed to adopt adequate security procedures to protect the information's confidentiality. Since their claim also turns on the submission without adequate security procedures (i.e., satisfactory encryption technology and fingerprint readers) and not simply on the public disclosure of ingredients, the sixty-day stay provision, even if valid, is not wholly dispositive. See United States v. Geophysical Corp. of Alaska, 732 F.2d 693, 698 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth further argues that under the Disclosure Act, DPH may release information about ingredients that are not trade secrets. Of course, as the Manufacturers point out, DPH does not need the Disclosure Act to publish information in the public domain. The Manufacturers, moreover, dispute that DPH could make such tailored disclosures without risk to trade secrets because they claim each ingredient in any particular brand alone to be a trade secret. In any event, even assuming that DPH could make ingredient disclosures that contain no secrets, this is not a case like Williamson County because there is \"no question here about how the regulations at issue [apply] to the particular [property] at issue.\" Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 520 U.S. 725, 739 (1997). Both sides moved for summary judgment and no claim is made that further administrative proceedings are contemplated before the Disclosure Act is applied to the Manufacturers. See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149. Whether the required disclosures encompass trade secrets and whether they constitute takings are questions of law ripe for adjudication. Knowing the exact nature and character of the property that may become implicated or the exact economic impact will not change the constitutional inquiry. No further factual development is shown to be necessary, particularly considering that the Manufacturers' claim rests not only on the ultimate disclosure by DPH but also on the adverse consequences of having to submit trade secret information to it without security precautions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the second ripeness prong--the hardship faced by the Manufacturers if decision is delayed. Delay would put the Manufacturers on the \"horns of a dilemma.\" Stern, 214 F.3d at 11. It would force the Manufacturers to choose between abandoning the Massachusetts market altogether or submitting trade secrets to DPH and risking their diminution or destruction. We conclude that, given \"the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration,\" Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149, the claims are ripe for review. See Suitum, 520 U.S. at 743-44 (\"'[W]here a regulation requires an immediate and significant change in the plaintiffs' conduct of their affairs with serious penalties attached to noncompliance,' hardship has been demonstrated.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The taking issue came before us in Philip Morris II in the context of the Commonwealth's appeal from the entry of a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Act. In affirming the injunction, we held that the Commonwealth's arguments did not \"satisf[y] its weighty burden of demonstrating the district court committed a clear error of law or an abuse of discretion [in granting the preliminary injunction].\" See Philip Morris II, 159 F.3d at 680. We made it clear that we did \"not rule definitively on the point,\" that our statements were of a \"probable outcome[],\" and that we \"cannot entirely dismiss the Commonwealth's argument.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now have before us the appeal from the summary judgment in favor of the Manufacturers, which we review de novo, Euromotion, Inc. v. BMW of N. Am., Inc., 136 F.3d 866, 869 (1st Cir. 1998), and we consider the issue with the benefit of additional briefing, argument, study and reflection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its summary judgment ruling, the district court held that by compelling public disclosure of trade secrets, the Disclosure Act will deprive the Manufacturers of their property interest in the trade secrets, resulting in a taking for which the Constitution requires that just compensation be made. In doing so, it relied on a line of cases addressing the validity of land use regulations, beginning with Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255 (1980), and on its interpretation of the decision in Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, which it held not to support the validity of the Disclosure Act. The district court's analysis reflects the two prongs of takings jurisprudence: per se (or categorical) takings and regulatory takings. Government action categorically violates the Takings Clause if it results in the permanent physical occupation of property or if it denies the owner all economically beneficial use of his property. See Lucas v. S. C. Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1015 (1992). In these instances, known as per se takings, just compensation is required, no matter how minor the invasion or how great the public purpose served by the regulation. Id. In contrast, in noncategorical regulatory takings cases, courts must engage in an ad hoc, factual inquiry to determine whether the government regulation goes too far. Id.; see also Penn. Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 415 (1922) (\"The general rule at least is that while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Per se Taking</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth contends that taking cases addressing land use regulations are inapposite. We agree. In Lucas, for example, the Court distinguished its taking analysis of a land use regulation from that of the government's exercise of its power to regulate, without compensation, the sale of goods in commerce. The Court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; \"[a]s long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power.\" And in the case of personal property, by reason of the State's traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to be aware of the possibility that new regulation might even render his property economically worthless (at least if the property's only economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale). In the case of land, however we think the notion pressed by the Council that title is somehow held subject to the \"implied limitation\" that the State may subsequently eliminate all economically valuable use is inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause that has become part of our constitutional culture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">505 U.S. 1027-28 (citations omitted). See also Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 396 (1994) (\"Cities have long engaged in the commendable task of land use planning, made necessary by increasing urbanization. . . .

Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 831-32 (1987) (\"[W]here governmental action results in '[a] permanent physical occupation' of the property, by the government itself or by others, 'our cases uniformly have found a taking to the extent of the occupation' . . . . We think a 'permanent physical occupation' has occurred, for purposes of that rule, where individuals are given a permanent and continuous right to pass to and fro, so that the real property may continuously be traversed . . . .\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential rationale of these cases is \"to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\" Nollan, 483 U.S. at 836 n.4 (quoting Armstrong v.

Because the Manufacturers are not asked to bear a burden that should instead be borne by Massachusetts citizens, this rationale has no relevance to the Disclosure Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other type of categorical taking occurs where the government denies all economically beneficial or productive use of the property. See Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1015. While a complete seizure of personal property may amount to a categorical taking, see, e.g., Armstrong, 364 U.S. at 46 (seizure of boats on which plaintiff held mechanics lien a taking); Nixon v. United States, 978 F.2d 1269, 1284 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (seizure of former President's papers a taking), we cannot conclude, under the reasoning of Lucas, that the regulation of personal property which may be destructive of the value of trade secret information can be regarded as such a taking. Rather, the Disclosure Act establishes a regulatory scheme conditioning the ability to sell tobacco products in Massachusetts on the reporting for potential public disclosure of trade secret information, deemed by the legislature to serve the interest of public health. Thus, in our view, the Disclosure Act does not result in a categorical taking. See Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 527 (1992) (noting the distinction between \"regulatory taking cases\" and cases of \"physical takings\"). Instead, we find instructive the Supreme Court's frequent observation that \"whether a particular restriction will be rendered invalid by the government's failure to pay for any [resulting] losses proximately caused by it depends largely 'upon the particular circumstances [in that] case'\"--that is, on \"essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries.\" Penn Cent. Trans. Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978) (citation omitted).

Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 991. FIFRA required all pesticides sold in interstate or foreign commerce for use within the United States to be registered with the Secretary of Agriculture and appropriately labeled. Id. It also empowered the Secretary to require applicants for registration to submit testing data, including pesticide formulae and data on a pesticide's health, safety, and environmental impact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Id. The first version of FIFRA, in effect from 1947 to 1972, specifically prohibited public disclosure of any formula information, but was silent as to disclosure of health and safety data submitted by manufacturers with applications for registration. Id. In 1972, due to \"mounting public concern about the safety of pesticides and their effect on the environment,\" Congress amended FIFRA's statutory scheme to provide for more comprehensive regulation. Id. It specifically prohibited the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from publicly disclosing any health, safety, and environmental data submitted by manufacturers which, both in its judgment and the submitting manufacturer's, contained or related to \"trade secrets or commercial or financial information.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Id. at 992. The third version, adopted in 1978, \"provide[d] for disclosure of all health, safety, and environmental data . . ., notwithstanding the prohibition against disclosure of trade secrets\" contained elsewhere in the statute. Id. at 995-96. The provision did not authorize disclosure of information that would reveal \"manufacturing or quality control processes\" or the identity or percentage quantity of deliberately added inert ingredients unless the EPA \"first determined that the disclosure is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Id. at 996.

Id. at 998-99. The Court acknowledged that to the extent that Monsanto had an interest in its health, safety, and environmental data cognizable as a trade-secret property right under state law, that property right was protected by the Takings Clause. Id. at 1003-04. It identified three factors to be taken into account in determining whether government action has gone beyond regulation and effects a taking: the character of the government action, its economic impact, and its interference with reasonable investment-backed expectations.

If Monsanto chose to submit the requisite data in order to receive a registration, it can hardly argue that its reasonable investment-backed expectations are disturbed when EPA acts to use or disclose the data in a manner that was authorized by law at the time of the submission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1006-07. The Manufacturers argue that the determining factor in this portion of the court's holding was not that the company had notice that its data might be disclosed but that it received compensating benefits for permitting the data to be used by the EPA. Their argument not only lacks textual support but also flies in the face of the plain language of the Court's opinion. The Manufacturers look for support in a footnote in the Nollan opinion which contains a passing reference to Monsanto, stating that there \"we found merely that the Takings Clause was not violated by giving effect to the Government's announcement that application for 'the right to [the] valuable Government benefit' of obtaining registration of an insecticide would confer upon the Government a license to use and disclose the trade secrets contained in the application.\" Nollan, 483 U.S. at 833 n.2 (citation omitted). This passage is somewhat misleading because the words it quotes are not those of the Monsanto Court but rather those of the appellee Monsanto. In its full context, the Court's statement is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Monsanto argues that the statute's requirement that a submitter give up its property interest in the data constitutes placing an unconstitutional condition on the right to a valuable Government benefit. See Brief for Appellee 29. But Monsanto has not challenged the ability of the Federal Government to regulate the marketing and use of pesticides. Nor could Monsanto successfully make such a challenge, for such restrictions are the burdens we all must bear in exchange for \"'the advantage of living and doing business in a civilized community.'\" This is particularly true in an area, such as pesticide sale and use, that has long been the source of public concern and the subject of government regulation. That Monsanto is willing to bear this burden in exchange for the ability to market pesticides in this country is evidenced by the fact that it has continued to expand its research and development and to submit data to EPA despite the enactment of the 1978 amendments to FIFRA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Thus as long as Monsanto is aware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the conditions are rationally related to a legitimate Government interest, a voluntary submission of data by an applicant in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking. See Corn Products Refining Co. v. Eddy, 249 U.S. 427, 431-432, 63 L. Ed. 689, 39 S.Ct. 325 (1919) (\"The right of a manufacturer to maintain secrecy as to his compounds and processes must be held subject to the right of the State, in the exercise of its police power and in promotion of fair dealing, to require that the nature of the product be fairly set forth\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. 1007-08 (some citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to imagine a more authoritative and compelling statement in support of the validity of the Disclosure Act.

Thus, in the case of information submitted during the pre-1972 scheme, the Court also found no taking. Certainly this conclusion cannot be rested on the receipt of any valuable Government benefits, for the pre-1972 scheme offered Monsanto none in exchange for submitting its information. And the generalized, nonspecific trade secret protection under the Trade Secrets Act is indistinguishable from that offered by Massachusetts law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, under the statutory scheme in effect in the 1972-78 period, Monsanto had an opportunity to protect its trade secrets from disclosure by designating them as trade secrets when submitted. The statute gave Monsanto explicit assurance that the EPA was prohibited from disclosing publicly any data submitted by an applicant if both the applicant and the EPA determined they were trade secrets. The Court held that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">with respect to trade secrets submitted under the statutory regime in force [during the 1972-78 period], the Federal Government had explicitly guaranteed to Monsanto and other registration applicants an extensive measure of confidentiality and exclusive use.

Id. at 1013. This analysis leaves no room to argue that Massachusetts' general statutory and common law protections of trade secrets create a reasonable, investment-backed expectation. See, e.g., Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v. Crampton, 282 N.E.2d 921, 925 (Mass. 1972); Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 4 &#167; 7, cl. 26(g) (exempting from protection trade secrets submitted as required by law).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> Those protections do not constitute \"explicit assurance of confidentiality\" binding on DPH with respect to the submission of data.

See Gen. Chemical Corp. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality Eng'g, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 287, 291 (1985) (\"We may assume that the legislature, in its regulation of hazardous waste industries, might prospectively deprive industries of a property right in the confidentiality of certain classes of records, even though they contain matter previously regarded as trade secrets); see generally restatement (third) of Unfair competition &#167; 40, cmt. c (1995) (commenting that a privilege to disclose trade secrets is likely to be recognized for \"information that is relevant to public health or safety . . .\"). Further, it is still an open question of state law \"what rights a submitter of information to a governmental entity may have to restrain disclosure of exempt information by that entity.\" Id. at 292-292 n.3 (quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v.

First, the court concluded, its practical effect would be to alter relationships in the market for tobacco products outside Massachussetts by depriving Manufacturers of the competitive advantage they would otherwise have in other markets by reason of their trade secrets. See Healy v. The Beer Inst., 491 U.S. 324, 339 (1989). Second, by conditioning the right to sell tobacco products on the surrender of valuable trade secrets, the Disclosure Act imposes a burden on commerce that exceeds its putative local benefits. See Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Extraterritorial Regulation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commerce Clause states: \"The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.  . . .\" U.S. Const. Art. I, &#167; 8 cl. 3. This affirmative grant of authority to Congress also encompasses an implicit \"dormant\" limitation on the authority of the states to enact legislation affecting interstate commerce. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 326. At the same time, the Supreme Court has long recognized that \"in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the state to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> So. Pac. Co. v. Arizona, ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U.S. 761, 767 (1945). While that \"residuum\" is particularly strong when a state acts in the interest of health and consumer protection, a finding that it has acted to further these matters of legitimate concern does not automatically end the inquiry. See Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 350 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted before that the prohibitions imposed upon state regulation by the Dormant Commerce Clause fall into three general categories. See Pharm. Research and Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon, 249 F.3d 66, 79 (1st Cir. 2001). First, a state statute which has an \"extraterritorial reach,\" whether intended or not, is a per se violation of the Clause. Id. Thus, when a state statute regulates commerce occurring wholly outside the state's borders or when it has a practical effect of requiring out-of-state conduct to be carried on according to in-state terms, it will be invalid. Id. Second, if a statute discriminates against out-of-state commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests, it will be held invalid unless the state can \"show that it advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.\" Or. Waste Sys., Inc. v. Dep't of Envtl. Quality of Or., 511 U.S. 93, 100-01 (1994) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). Lastly, we apply a lower level of scrutiny when the state statute does not discriminate but has incidental effects on interstate commerce. Concannon, 249 F.3d at 80. \"Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\" Pike, 397 U.S. at 142.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manufacturers first argue that to require public disclosure of commercially important trade secrets negates the protection afforded by every other state. But the cases principally relied on do not support a finding of extraterritorial regulation. Those cases involved a particularized regulatory scheme--so-called price affirmation--requiring out-of-state shippers to affirm that their posted in-state prices for products are no higher than those in the bordering states. Healy, 491 U.S. at 325; see also Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth., 476 U.S. 573 (1986); Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, 294 U.S. 511, 519 (1935). In Healy, the Court struck down a Connecticut requirement that out-of-state beer shippers affirm that their posted prices in Connecticut were no higher than their lowest prices in any border state. 491 U.S. at 329. The Court found the statute to have extraterritorial effect by \"preventing brewers from undertaking competitive pricing [out-of-state] based on prevailing market conditions . . . [and] requir[ing] out-of-state shippers to forgo the implementation of competitive-pricing schemes in out-of-state markets because those pricing decisions are imported by statute into the Connecticut market regardless of local competitive conditions.\" Id. at 338-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Healy and the other cases on which the Manufacturers rely to be inapposite. The reasoning underlying those decisions--all of which involved price controls, price affirmation, or price tying schemes--is wholly inapplicable to the Disclosure Act. A price control, affirmation or tying scheme restricts the advantage of interstate sellers in local markets by extending a state's control over prices across state lines, viz. to lower prices out-of-state, a shipper must lower its prices in the regulating state as well. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 326; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 582; Baldwin, 294 U.S. 519; see also Concannon, 249 F.3d at 81. The Disclosure Act (aside from having nothing to do with prices) does not purport to regulate across state lines, nor is it an attempt at economic protectionism by the Commonwealth; its out-of-state effect is merely incidental to an in-state (non-price) regulatory scheme and any resulting loss of competitive advantage is unrelated to interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions involving other interstate transactions also help to illumine the principle of extraterritoriality and its inapplicability here. Thus, in Nat'l Solid Wastes Mgmt. Ass'n v. Meyer, 63 F.3d 652 (7th Cir. 1995), the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a Wisconsin statute conditioning the use of Wisconsin landfills by non-Wisconsin waste generators on their home communities' adoption and enforcement of Wisconsin recycling standards, finding that \"the Wisconsin statute seeks to force Wisconsin's judgment with respect to solid waste recycling on communities in its sister states 'at the pain of an absolute ban on the flow of interstate commerce.'\" Id. at 660 (quoting Baldwin, 294 U.S. at 524). See also Fort Gratiot Sanitary Landfill, Inc. v. Mich. Dep't of Natural Res., 504 U.S. 353 (1992) (striking down waste import restriction); compare Cotto Waxo Co. v. Williams, 46 F.3d 790, 794 (8th Cir. 1995) (upholding statute prohibiting import into Minnesota of petroleum-based sweeping compounds, the court stated, \"Clearly, the Act has affected Cotto Waxo's participation in interstate commerce. Nevertheless, the Act itself is indifferent to sales occurring out-of-state.\"). The Disclosure Act does not require that out-of-state commerce in tobacco products be conducted according to in-state terms. It imposes no mandates or restrictions on other states. It simply requires that the Manufacturers, should they chose to do business in Massachusetts, provide additional ingredient information to the Commonwealth's health authorities. This may eventually impact the profits of some Manufacturers, but \"[s]imply because the manufacturers' profits might be negatively affected by the [statute], however, does not necessarily mean that the [statute] is regulating those profits.\" Concannon, 249 F.3d at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manufacturers' reliance on BMW of North America v. Gore, 517 U.S. 559 (1996), is also misplaced. Gore was a due process clause case, not a commerce clause case. It involved an Alabama punitive damage award against a national car distributor, BMW, whose policy of not informing dealers of minor pre-delivery damage was challenged by an Alabama customer. In the Supreme Court, Gore argued that the large punitive damage award was necessary to induce BMW to change a nationwide disclosure policy that, even if found unlawful in Alabama, was lawful in a number of states. The Court held that while Alabama could inflict penalties on those who transgress its laws, in the interest of protecting its consumers, it does not have the power to punish BMW for conduct that was lawful where it occurred and had no impact on Alabama or its residents. Id. at 572. Thus, Alabama could \"not impose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changing the tortfeasors' lawful conduct in other States.\" Id. at 572 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Disclosure Act bears no resemblance to the judgment imposed in Gore. First, the Commonwealth can hardly be deemed to be instituting \"economic penalties\" along the lines of those described in BMW. See S.D. Meyers, Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, 253 F.3d 461, 2001 WL 664233 *8 (9th Cir.(Cal.)). The Disclosure Act, by providing for disclosure, may economically harm the Manufacturers, but it does not impose a \"legislatively authorized fine.\" BMW, 517 U.S. at 571. Second, even if we accept the Manufacturers' proposition, nothing in the record indicates, nor do the Manufacturers seriously contend, that the Commonwealth intends to affect national tobacco policy. Rather, it aims to protect its own consumers and, presumably, through future savings in medical expenses should the education effort reduce tobacco use, its economy. BMW, 517 U.S. at 571.

Thus, the aggregate reporting required by the federal schemes, lumping together some 700 ingredients without indication which are found in which brand, would certainly not achieve \"the hoped-for benefit\" of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> This is so even though, as the court explained, \"consumers already have the ability to compare brands on the basis of the most notoriously harmful aspects of every brand, such as nicotine and tar.\" The aim of the Disclosure Act is educating Massachusetts consumers and helping them to choose less harmful brands, taking into account not only advertised nicotine and tar ratings but also the synergistic effects of various additives, such as those enhancing the delivery of \"free\" nicotine to the consumer (thus making deceptive the \"light\" and \"ultra light\" labels on many brands). Without brand-specific ingredient lists, researchers do not know which combinations to test and are left to guess which additives might co-exist in certain formulas on the market; like the Manufacturers' competitors, they cannot reverse engineer a formula and thus any health research they conduct is difficult and at best inexact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Brand-specific information in order of magnitude would enable DPH to use its resources most efficiently by targeting the most popular brands, focusing on those ingredients present in the highest quantity to serve the Act's purpose of providing information to consumers about the health risks of particular brands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, disclosure under the Disclosure Act will put consumers in a better position to know if their brand contains harmful additives, and to assess the health risks involved.

In turning a deaf ear to this constitutional compulsion, I fear that they have fallen into an ancient trap. See East India Co. v. Paul, 13 Eng. Rep. 811, 821 (P.C. 1849) (Campbell, L.J.) (admonishing that \"it is the duty of all Courts of Justice to take care, for the general good of the community, that hard cases do not make bad law\"). Because the majority's holding allows states to ransack the trade secrets of virtually any business without providing even minimal recompense, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before proceeding to address the takings issue, I think it is useful to narrow my differences with my colleagues. We agree that information provided to DPH under the Act inevitably will be disclosed to the public, and that such information will include valuable trade secrets, susceptible to destruction if so exposed. With this in mind, I believe that this court's prior opinion in Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger, 159 F.3d 670 (1st Cir. 1998) (Philip Morris II), provides the correct interpretation and application of the Takings Clause vis-a-vis the Manufacturers' trade secrets. As that opinion explains, the Supreme Court's multifaceted decision in Monsanto requires that the government provide a benefit of real value to a private party whenever the government divulges that party's trade secrets (and, thus, takes its property). See id. at 676.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than repastinating this well-ploughed ground, I think that my time (and the reader's) is better spent elaborating upon what I perceive to be the three major errors in the majority's analysis of this issue: (1) the failure to acknowledge the full extent of the Manufacturers' property interest in their trade secrets; (2) the restriction of the per se takings doctrine to real property interests; and (3) the conclusion, under the regulatory takings doctrine, that the Act comports with the teachings of Monsanto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the majority starts off on the wrong foot: my colleagues do not properly distinguish the Manufacturers' property interest in their trade secrets from the Manufacturers' property interest in their tobacco products. Massachusetts law long has protected trade secrets as property. See Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v. Crampton, 385 N.E.2d 1349, 1354-55 &amp; n.8 (Mass. 1979) (detailing the extensive historical case law and statutory protections of trade secrets in Massachusetts). Such a trade secret -- one that has achieved the status of a property interest under state law -- is, in and of itself, property for the purposes of the Takings Clause. See Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1003-04. Hence, the Takings Clause should apply to such trade secrets independent of the holders' property rights in the products that embody them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That seems fairly straightforward. It seems equally straightforward that the extent of the holder's interest in a trade secret typically is defined by the extent to which the holder protects that interest from disclosure to others. Id. at 1002. These verities, coupled with the majority's concession that the Act may well result in revealing the Manufacturers' trade secrets to the public, ante at 53-54, point unerringly to the conclusion that the Commonwealth, by making such revelations, will drain all economic value from the Manufacturers' property interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is most curious, then, that the majority writes around this rather blatant deprivation of a recognized property interest, treating the Manufacturers' interest in their trade secrets as a sort of quasi-interest, protected only to the extent that tobacco products are protected. To this end, the majority characterizes the Act as \"a regulatory scheme conditioning the ability to sell tobacco products in Massachusetts on the reporting for potential public disclosure of trade secret information, deemed by the legislature to serve the interest of public health,\" ante at 56, and declares that \"the Manufacturers have no cognizable property right in their brand-specific ingredient information in the face of state health and safety regulatory authority,\" id. at 32 n.21. Under the majority's interpretation, the property interest in a trade secret lasts only until the state determines that it will regulate the product in which the trade secret is incorporated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I cannot accede to this resupinate reasoning. Property interests are fashioned, and their contours etched, by state law. See Bd. of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). Under Massachusetts law, companies have interests in their trade secrets quite apart from their interests in the products to which those secrets relate, see Jet Spray, 385 Mass. at 166 n.8, and federal courts are obliged to follow this line of authority in determining whether the destruction of trade secrets constitutes a taking. Consequently, we must analyze a state's enforced disclosure of a trade secret without regard to the product in which that trade secret is embodied. When my colleagues note that the Manufacturers are regulated in other areas of their business and then treat that fact as dispositive of the takings claim, they act entirely without support in the reported cases and, in the bargain, violate a fundamental postulate of Takings Clause jurisprudence: that \"a sovereign, by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into public property without compensation.\" Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1012 (citation and internal punctuation omitted). And this extraordinary attempt to carve out a judge-made exception for cases in which a trade secret relates to a regulated product is bad policy as well as bad law: given that virtually every sector of life is subject to government regulation, the majority's holding would permit a state to violate the trade secrets of nearly every legitimate business without providing compensation so long as the state is acting under its police power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aligning the analytic framework in what I believe to be the proper fashion has important consequences. To the extent that a property interest in a trade secret is independent from the holder's property interest in its tobacco products, the Act is patently an expropriation of the former interest and requires compensation under the Takings Clause. See Lane v. Commonwealth, 517 N.E.2d 1281, 1283 (Mass. 1988) (\"The idea that agents of the government could properly seize and use property of a citizen without legislative or common law authority and without compensation is unacceptable. The likely unconstitutionality of such an uncompensated act is obvious.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's next error lies in its modest view of per se takings jurisprudence. Under the per se takings doctrine, as I understand it, government action is \"compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the restraint.\" Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1015 (1992). The doctrine applies whenever the government either effects a \"permanent physical occupation\" of a property, Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 441 102 S.Ct. 3164 (1982), or establishes a rule (as, say, by enacting a law or promulgating a regulation) that deprives the property of all economically viable use, Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1027. Because the majority now holds -- mistakenly, in my view -- that the per se takings doctrine does not apply to the confiscation of the Manufacturers' trade secrets, ante at 56-57, I discuss the matter here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In holding that the Act does not effect a per se taking, the majority rejects the Loretto branch of the per se takings doctrine, declaring that this case does not fit within the supposedly essential rationale of physical invasion cases: that an individual should not bear a public burden alone when that burden should be borne by the public as a whole. Ante at 56. My colleagues then reject the Lucas branch of the doctrine by repeating their original mistake: they see the deprivation of the Manufacturers' trade secrets as part of a larger picture involving the regulation of tobacco. Consistent with this approach, my colleagues read Lucas narrowly and limit per se takings under that doctrinal branch to claims involving land use regulations in contradistinction to claims arising out of \"the government's exercise of its power to regulate, without compensation, the sale of goods in commerce.\" Ante at 55-56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I take the position opposite to the majority. Even though state law defines the boundaries of property, \"a State may not sidestep the Takings Clause by disavowing traditional property interests long recognized under state law.\" Phillips v. Wash. Legal Found., 524 U.S. 156, 167 (1998). Here, then, we must analyze the per se takings doctrine in light of the long-recognized property interest imbued in trade secrets under Massachusetts law. That analysis indicates to me that the public disclosure of the Manufacturers' trade secrets likely constitutes a per se taking under both the Loretto and Lucas strands of the doctrine. On the one hand, the government has taken the valuable property of a business (i.e., its trade secrets) and converted that property to public use, much like an enforced permanent easement that works a physical occupation of a tract of land. See Nollan v. Cal. Coastal Comm'n, 483 U.S. 825, 831 (1987). On the other hand, the Act may be seen as a means of exhibiting the Manufacturers' trade secrets to the public at large and draining them of their inherent value, in the same way that an overly intrusive land use regulation may deprive a parcel of real property of all economically viable use. I discuss each of these scenarios in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Permanent occupation. In Loretto, the Court made clear the distinctions between a permanent occupation, a transient invasion, and a regulation that restricts the use of property. 458 U.S. at 430. It first distinguished a permanent occupation from a temporary one on the ground that, in the former case, no balancing test was needed; rather, the occupation, in and of itself, triggered the right to compensation. Id. at 432. The Court then distinguished a permanent occupation from a regulation restricting property use on the ground that, in the former situation, \"the government does not simply take a single 'strand' from the 'bundle' of property rights: it chops through the bundle, taking a slice of every strand.\" Id. at 435. Critical to this last analysis is the right to exclude others from the property, \"traditionally . . . considered one of the most treasured strands in an owner's bundle of property rights.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The public disclosure of a closely held trade secret is much like a permanent occupation. The disclosure is irreversible and the information thereafter is shared by all. Even though the Loretto Court routinely placed the adjective \"physical\" next to the term \"occupation,\" there is no logical rationale as to why such an occupation must be corporeal. Given that the relevant definition of property is found in an independent source of law -- in this case, the Massachusetts law of property -- a nonphysical occupation of nonphysical property should demand compensation just as much as a physical occupation of physical property. The property owner's right to exclude others -- the critical aspect of most property rights, and of crucial importance here -- has dissolved just as completely in the one case as in the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the case law on this point admittedly is sparse, I find Nixon v. United States, 978 F.2d 1269 (D.C. Cir. 1992), instructive. There, the court of appeals held that the government's taking of presidential papers constituted a per se taking. Id. at 1284-87. In so holding, the court rejected the argument that the per se takings doctrine applied only to the physical occupation of real property:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Government's inference that the per se doctrine must be limited to real property is without basis in the law, and we see no reason to give it one. One may be just as permanently and completely dispossessed of personal property as of real property. Any distinction along these lines would be purely artificial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1285. The court then proceeded to find a taking, stressing President Nixon's loss of his \"paramount property right\" -- the right to exclude others from his papers. See id. at 1286-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same rationale applies here. Even if the Act does not grant the Commonwealth exclusive control of the confiscated information, it nonetheless deprives the Manufacturers of the right to exclude others. Much like the landowner who is compelled to grant an unwanted easement, the Manufacturers still will have access to their hard-won property, but will be forced to share that property with the public (including their competitors). As such, the Act effects a permanent occupation and the Manufacturers must be compensated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Destruction of all economically viable use. Since the intrinsic value of a trade secret mounts in direct proportion to the extent that it is secret, the Act also works a per se taking by displaying trade secrets to the public at large and thus depriving the Manufacturers of the entire economic value of their property. Under the applicable precedents, the Commonwealth \"may resist compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into the nature of the owner's estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of [what he owned].\" Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1027. Given that the states have a traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings, a state may regulate the sale of personal property even though its only economically productive use is its sale and the regulation makes the property worthless. Id. at 1027-28. A good example of this phenomenon is the right to regulate the sale of narcotics or particular types of weapons. Apart from restrictions on sale, however, the justification for other limitations that deprive the property of all economic value must be found within the parameters of the property interest or within the background principles of the state's property law. See id. at 1029-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that in limiting Lucas and its progeny to land use cases, the majority has adopted an overly literal view. While Lucas, Dolan, and Nollan all involved land use regulations, there is no reason to think that their teachings pertain only to real property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> As said, state law defines property interests for purposes of the Takings Clause. Webb's Fabulous Pharms., Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 161 (1980). Thus, since Massachusetts defines a trade secret as property, common sense suggests that Lucas should apply. Indeed, the Lucas Court's avowed deference to background principles of state property law in determining whether the state has effected a total taking makes this conclusion nearly irresistible. Whether one looks at a taking of land or a taking of some other form of property, the critical question -- leaving aside the sale of personal property -- is whether the challenged regulation prohibits a productive use that previously was permissible under relevant principles of state property law. See Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1029-30. As such, Lucas speaks to the character of the governmental action, not the character of the affected property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Lucas branch of the per se takings doctrine, the Act fails. The Manufacturers own the trade secrets. Their property interest in the embodied data is irretrievably lost once the secrets are disclosed to others. See Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1011. That being so, the background principles of Massachusetts property law compel the conclusion that the government cannot destroy all economically valuable uses of the Manufacturers' trade secrets without providing compensation. After all, Massachusetts law traditionally has protected such secrets from invasion by outside parties, and there is no historical precedent for making an exception here. See Lane, 517 N.E.2d at 1282-83. Thus, if we are to pass on whether the Act effects a per se taking under the Lucas branch of the doctrine, we must answer in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I turn now to the majority's third major mistake. In Philip Morris II, we stated that \"the Commonwealth's unilateral announcement that the privilege of continuing to do business in Massachusetts henceforth will entail the yielding of a tobacco company's trade secrets cannot, in itself, establish a benefit sufficient to support a voluntary exchange within the Monsanto paradigm.\" 159 F.3d at 677. The majority now backtracks on this pronouncement, offering three reasons for doing so. In my judgment, none of these reasons warrant such resipiscence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the majority cites language from Monsanto purportedly establishing that the right to sell tobacco products within Massachusetts is a \"benefit.\" Ante at 59-60. Placing this argument into perspective requires an understanding of the tripartite structure of the Monsanto opinion. In the period before 1972, Monsanto and other pesticide manufacturers submitted trade secrets to federal authorities without any expectation that they would be kept secret. When the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revealed this data, there was no taking.  Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1013. In the period between 1972 and 1978, the EPA gave explicit assurances that it would not disclose the submitted trade secrets. Failure to keep this pledge, the Court held, would result in an unconstitutional taking unless the affected manufacturers were adequately compensated for the loss in market value engendered by the EPA's disclosure. Id. at 1013-14. In the period after 1978, the EPA in fact compensated the pesticide manufacturers for disclosure of their trade secrets, and the Court held that this arrangement did not effect an unconstitutional taking because the compensation was just. Id. at 1007-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority, in a somewhat misleading fashion, quotes language applicable to the third Monsanto period and deems it dispositive: \"as long as Monsanto is aware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the conditions are rationally related to a legitimate Government interest, a voluntary submission of data by an applicant in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking.\" Ante at 59 (quoting Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1007). Starting from this premise, the majority concludes that the \"benefit\" which Monsanto received in exchange for the submission of data -- the ability to market pesticides in this country -- is no different from the \"benefit\" that the Manufacturers receive under the Act, namely, \"the ability to market tobacco products in Massachusetts.\" Ante at 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a quantum leap, unjustified either in law or in logic. I think that we had it right the first time, when we stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he 1972-78 period presents the closest, most persuasive analogy to the situation created by Section 307B. The FIFRA scheme then in effect provided specific protections for trade secret information -- and the Court determined that pesticide registrants might reasonably rely on these protections. The statutory and common law protections for trade secret information in place in the Commonwealth create a very similar prophylaxis and thus form the basis for a reasonable expectation of continued confidentiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Philip Morris II, 159 F.3d at 678 (citation omitted). In the period after 1978, by contrast, the EPA provided compensation to pesticide manufacturers in the form of exclusive use rights to the data for ten years and compensation from later applicants for the next five years. Though the benefit was limited in scope and duration, Monsanto at least received something over and above the status quo: exclusive use rights and enforced compensation from competitors may not seem like much in the abstract, but they were more than what the pesticide manufacturers had before 1978.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority attempts to draw a parallel here, visualizing the Commonwealth as conferring a benefit on the Manufacturers when it allows them to continue selling tobacco products in Massachusetts. This creates a false dichotomy. As we have said, the privilege of continuing to conduct one's business \"simply is not analogous, either in kind or in degree, to the benefit that effected the exchange and extinguished the takings claim in Monsanto.\" Philip Morris II, 159 F.3d at 677. Because the Act does not offer the Manufacturers anything more than what they already have, it does not afford due compensation for a taking of valuable property rights. Id. at 678. We would not permit a valuable parcel of land to be taken at a zero valuation simply because the sovereign promised to let the owner use it in common with the general public. It follows inexorably that we should not permit the sovereign to take trade secrets at a zero valuation, publicly disclose them, and pay no compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second pillar on which the majority's Monsanto analysis rests is the holding in Corn Products Refining Company v. Eddy, 249 U.S. 427, 431-32 (1919), that a property right in a trade secret is subject to the state's police power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> Ante at 60-61. The majority touts Corn Products as \"a decision whose age has not staled its authority,\" and proclaims that it \"underlines the sweep of the Monsanto holding.\" Ante at 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I beg to differ. If Corn Products has not completely staled, there is at least some mildew around the edges. In the eighty-two years since the publication of that opinion, Takings Clause and trade secret jurisprudence has developed in ways not foreseen by the Corn Products Court. As part of this progression, Monsanto substantially limited the breadth of Corn Products, citing it only in the context of the third period (i.e., after the EPA fully compensated the pesticide manufacturers for the taking). Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1007-08. Had Corn Products been able to carry the weight attributed to it by the majority, then the EPA would not have been forced to compensate Monsanto for divulging trade secrets in the second period (1972-1978). To my mind, the portion of Corn Products cited in Monsanto and by the majority here -- one paragraph in all -- now stands only for the proposition that the state is free to use its police power to force a manufacturer to list product ingredients on the label so long as the state has compensated the manufacturer for the forced disclosure of any trade secrets. There is no such compensation here and, accordingly, Corn Products is inapposite.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the majority analogizes the Act to the pre-1972 regulatory scheme in Monsanto, presuming that the \"nonspecific trade secret protection under the [federal] Trade Secrets Act is indistinguishable from that offered by Massachusetts law.\" Ante at 60-61. The majority reasons that because the Act does not provide assurances to the Manufacturers that the trade secrets will be protected, the Commonwealth does not have to compensate them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> Ante at 61-62. Accordingly, the Act \"is a valid exercise of the police power and, in the absence of explicit guarantees of confidentiality from the Commonwealth, does not effect an unconstitutional taking.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rationale is alarming. As I understand the majority, any time the state chooses to deprive a corporation of a trade secret without compensation, its safest course, constitutionally speaking, will be to do so without offering the slightest assurance that the trade secret will remain confidential. This view of the law is wholly unsupported by Monsanto: in the period before 1972, the pesticide manufacturers were on notice that their trade secrets would not be kept confidential because the EPA engaged in the widespread practice of using data submitted by one pesticide manufacturer in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1009-10 &amp; n.14. Thus, this portion of the Monsanto opinion stands for the proposition that a party does not have a reasonable expectation that a trade secret will remain in the bosom of the lodge when the government has been disclosing the information all along. That is not the situation here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's reasoning on this point has a second fault: it presumes that courts measure the reasonable investment-backed expectation of an aggrieved party at the time the state promulgates a regulation that effects a taking. True to this presumption, the majority analyzes the reasonable investment-backed expectation here only after the Act has been passed, and accordingly, finds that there is no such expectation. I believe, however, that we should follow the Second Circuit's lead and hold that \"the critical time for considering investment-backed expectations is the time a property is acquired, not the time the challenged regulation is enacted.\" Meriden Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Co. v. FDIC, 62 F.3d 449, 454 (2d Cir. 1995). One sound reason for adhering to this view is that the majority's contrary interpretation robs the concept of \"reasonable investment-backed expectation\" of any meaning; if a reasonable investment-backed expectation only commences when the challenged regulation comes into play, then such expectations are always subject to the whims of the state. If this prong of the regulatory taking inquiry is to have any import, the court must examine the reasonable investment-backed expectations at the time that the investment is backed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pulling these threads together, I think it is perspicuous that the Act dashes the Manufacturers reasonable investment-backed expectations. Much like the pesticide manufacturers in Monsanto during the 1972-1978 period, the Manufacturers invested millions of dollars in developing ingredient combinations whilst relying on the trade secret protections embedded in Massachusetts law. Nothing in the Commonwealth's practice or in its jurisprudence gave them reason to suspect that the Commonwealth would later demand the revelation of the fruits of their labor for the public good.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the Manufacturers have gone to great lengths to keep their secrets and have done so without any reason to expect governmental interference, much less government-enforced dissemination of that confidential information. Yet the Commonwealth is on the brink of taking those secrets, without offering in return anything above what the Manufacturers already have.

Should it choose this course, however, the Commonwealth must accord the Manufacturers' property interests the same respect that it would show to the property interests of any other legitimate person, firm, or corporation. To that end, the Commonwealth must provide adequate compensation to the Manufacturers for the trade secrets that it destroys. Because the Act and this court's opinion permit the Commonwealth to shirk this obligation, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Monsanto Court did not address whether the taking of a trade secret could constitute a per se taking. We avoided that question in Philip Morris II, 159 F.3d at 674 n.4, finding the Manufacturers' challenge to the Act likely to succeed under the regulatory takings doctrine. I continue to believe that Philip Morris II stayed the proper course, but the majority's conclusory statement of views on the per se takings doctrine cannot be left unanswered.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To be sure, Lucas makes a brief distinction between personal property and landed interests, but the distinction is between the restrictions on commercial sale of personal property and the restrictions on commercial sale of land.

That case, which held that the federal government could prohibit the sale of bird feathers without offending the Takings Clause, id. at 64-68, has no bearing here: Massachusetts has not attempted a mere prohibition on the sale of trade secrets; instead, it has paved the way for the utter destruction of their value.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The majority implies that Massachusetts law has carved an exception to the inviolability of trade secrets when that information is submitted to government pursuant to law.

In any event, were we to follow Justice O'Connor's suggestion and look at the protections given to trade secrets by Massachusetts law (as opposed to how trade secrets are treated by the government in practice), we would reach the same conclusion: the Manufacturers have a reasonable investment-backed expectation that their trade secrets will remain inviolate.

Ante at 61-62 n.21. Because I believe that the Manufacturers have such a property interest, I also believe that the Commonwealth may not deprive them of that interest without the necessary procedural safeguards, i.e., a hearing. Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 (1976). The essential requirement of this hearing is that it affords notice and an opportunity to respond. Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 546 (1985). Whenever feasible, it must occur prior to the deprivation. Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 132 (1990). Those safeguards are not in evidence here, at least as to the procedures laid out by the Attorney General for the protection of trade secrets furnished by the Manufacturers.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The district court held the statute to violate the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments by effecting an uncompensated taking, the Due Process Clause, and the Commerce Clause, and entered a permanent injunction. We have jurisdiction over this appeal and reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs-appellees are manufacturers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco (the Manufacturers).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Since the late 1970s, when consumers began demanding lower tar and nicotine levels, the Manufacturers have increased the number of additives, other than tobacco, in their products, ostensibly to offset the lost flavor and taste. Today the Manufacturers report using approximately 700 additives, many of which are the focus of public health officials' concern. The Manufacturers assert that these additives, besides improving taste, flavor and aroma, serve as solvents, processing aids, and pH modifiers, and also fulfill other chemical functions. Each brand contains a combination of ingredients that substantially contributes to its distinctiveness and thus its competitive success. As such a formula gives a manufacturer a competitive advantage over other manufacturers who cannot, given the current state of technology, mimic it, the Manufacturers have invested many millions of dollars in creating their distinctive blends and take extensive precautions to protect the identity of the ingredients from disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal law requires the Manufacturers to submit to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) an aggregate list of ingredients used in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, without identification of the relevant manufacturer or brand or disclosure of quantities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Thus, although the lists compiled under the federal statutes are voluminous, they do not identify the ingredients (or the amounts) used in any particular brand nor do they enable public health experts to research how these ingredients might impact health when combined in particular amounts with others. See E.R. at 516 (Letter from David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D., Director of Centers for Disease Control, to Congress (\"Many of the approximately 700 ingredients added to tobacco could be causes of diseases or potential adverse health effects, if a sufficiently high dose is ingested. . . . [W]e do not know what potentially harmful byproducts may be produced when tobacco additives are burned alone or in combination, as they are in cigarettes.\")). In 1996, responding to what it perceived as this very problem, the Massachusetts legislature enacted the Massachusetts Tobacco Ingredients and Nicotine Yield Act (the Disclosure Act), the law at issue here. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 94, &#167; 307B (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Disclosure Act requires each manufacturer to provide the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (DPH) with an annual report listing, for each brand, \"the identity of any added constituent . . . in descending order according to weight, measure, or numerical count.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Disclosure Act further provides that both the brand's ingredient list and nicotine yield rating (the estimated amount of nicotine an average consumer would ingest when using the product) \"shall\" become a public record if two conditions are met. First, DPH must determine that \"there is a reasonable scientific basis for concluding that the availability of such information could reduce risks to public health.\" See Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105, &#167;&#167; 660.200(A)-(C). Second, the Massachusetts Attorney General must advise DPH that the public release of the information would not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property. Id. 105, &#167;&#167; 660.200(D)-(E). The regulations require DPH to give the manufacturer sixty days' written notice of the information to be disclosed if the Attorney General decides that disclosure would not be a taking. Id. &#167; 660.200(E). The manufacturer may then cease sales in Massachusetts or remove the product from the Massachusetts market in order to reformulate it without the constituent(s) identified as problematic by DPH. Id. &#167; 660.200(F). Under a 1999 amendment to the regulations, all information provided to DPH is to remain confidential unless and until: (1) the manufacturer notifies DPH in writing that it does not consider the additive information it has submitted to be confidential; (2) sixty days has elapsed since DPH notified the manufacturer of the information to be disclosed and no complaint has been filed in a court of competent jurisdiction challenging disclosure on the grounds that it would make public a trade secret; (3) disclosure is authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction and the time for appeal has elapsed; or (4) disclosure is authorized by agreement of the parties. Id. &#167; 660.200(G).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Disclosure Act will enable DPH to study additives and the potential synergistic effects of certain ingredients in particular brands to determine whether they present health risks. If the requirements for public disclosure are met, DPH will be able to inform consumers whether a particular brand contains ingredients it has determined to be associated with adverse health effects, including enhanced nicotine delivery. In particular, it will be able to inform consumers whether the designation of several brands as \"light\" or \"ultra light\" (based upon estimates of low tar and nicotine delivery under the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) machine testing method) is misleading. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44,970-79, 974 (Aug. 28, 1996) (noting that the Food and Drug Administration has found that \"the actual nicotine delivery to the smoker from some brands may be higher than the FTC yield because of the addition of ammonia or similar compounds to increase free nicotine\"); see also 61 Fed. Reg. 45,108-16 (Aug. 28, 1996) (detailing similar manipulation of nicotine delivery in smokeless tobacco). Even in the absence of public disclosure, DPH's study of additive safety could provide valuable information contributing to public health.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Texas has also enacted legislation requiring brand-specific reporting of ingredients.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> See Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &#167;&#167; 161.351-.355 (1999). The Texas statute obligates the Manufacturers to report the same information required by the Disclosure Act, but, like the federal statutes which require the Secretary of DHHS to treat the submitted information as \"trade secret or confidential information,\" see 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1335a(b)(2)(A); 15 U.S.C. &#167; 4403(b)(2)(A), the Texas statute provides explicit protection for trade secrets. See Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. &#167; 161.354(d) (1999). It is the absence of such protection in the Disclosure Act, and the consequences that may ensue, that impel the Manufacturers' challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manufacturers initially filed this action in the fall of 1996. In separate suits which were later consolidated, the cigarette and smokeless tobacco companies claimed that the statute was preempted by federal law and that it ran afoul of the Takings Clause, the Commerce Clause, and the Due Process Clause. On February 7, 1997, the district court held that the Disclosure Act was not preempted by either the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1331-41, or the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, 15 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 4401-08. After granting interlocutory review, this court affirmed. Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger (\"Philip Morris I\"), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744751\"><a href=\"/opinion/744751/philip-morris-incorporated-rj-reynolds-tobacco-company-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1997, the Manufacturers moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent enforcement of the Disclosure Act's ingredient-reporting requirements. In December 1997, the district court, finding that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their taking claim and that they faced irreparable harm, enjoined the Commonwealth from enforcing these provisions. On interlocutory appeal, we once again affirmed. Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger (\"Philip Morris II\"), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758794\"><a href=\"/opinion/758794/philip-morris-incorporated-v-scott-harshbarger-attorney-general-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1998, all parties filed summary judgment motions, and on September 7, 2000, the district court granted the Manufacturers' motions and denied the Commonwealth's. Finding that the ingredient-reporting provisions of the Disclosure Act would effect an uncompensated taking of the Manufacturers' trade secrets in violation of the Fifth Amendment, would impose an undue burden on interstate commerce in violation of the Commerce Clause, and would deny the Manufacturers due process by depriving them of a meaningful opportunity to argue against publication of their trade secrets prior to public release, the court permanently enjoined the Commonwealth from enforcing those provisions of the Disclosure Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The Commonwealth timely filed this appeal, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, and we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III.</p>\n    <p>RIPENESS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth first contends that this case is not ripe for review. Relying on Williamson County Regional Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span> (1985), it argues that regulatory taking claims are not ripe until the government agency charged with implementing the challenged law has made a final decision about the application of the law to the property in question. Because DPH has not determined whether or to what extent to publicly release the ingredient lists, it argues, there has been no final decision with regard to disclosure of the Manufacturers' trade secrets and thus preenforcement review is not warranted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ruling on ripeness, the district court focused on the statute. With regard to the first condition to disclosure--that DPH determine that \"there is a reasonable scientific basis for concluding that the availability of such information could reduce risks to public health\"--the court found this threshold so low that an affirmative answer was all but a foregone conclusion. With regard to the second--that the Attorney General advise that disclosure would not constitute an unconstitutional taking--the court found that, given the Attorney General's position in this litigation, there was no question as to what his advice would be. Thus, the court concluded, there was no need for further \"ripening\" of the issues or factual development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The point of the ripeness inquiry is primarily \"to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements.\" Abbott Labs. v. Gardner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span>, 148 (1967). We apply a two-part test to assess ripeness. See Stern v. United States District Court for the District of Mass., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768899\"><a href=\"/opinion/768899/donald-k-stern-v-united-states-district-court-for-the-district-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 2000). First, we must determine whether the issue presented is fit for judicial review--\"an inquiry that 'typically involves subsidiary queries concerning finality, definiteness, and the extent to which resolution of the challenge depends on facts that may not yet be sufficiently developed.'\" Id. (quoting Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195859\"><a href=\"/opinion/195859/ernst-young-v-depositors-economic/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span>, 535 (1st Cir. 1995)). Second, we must evaluate the extent to which passing on the issue will impose hardship--\"an inquiry that 'typically turns upon whether the challenged action creates a \"direct and immediate\" dilemma for the parties.'\" Id. (quoting W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. EPA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"579948\"><a href=\"/opinion/579948/wr-grace-co-conn-v-united-states-environmental-protection-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></a></span>, 364 (1st Cir. 1992) (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first prong, the Commonwealth argues that the district court erred in treating disclosure as a foregone conclusion. We disagree. The Disclosure Act's accompanying regulations define the terms \"could reduce the risks to public health\" to mean \"that knowledge about an added constituent could result in reduced risk of adverse health effects associated with tobacco use, including but not limited to nicotine addiction and adverse health effects associated with exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.\" Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105, &#167; 660.003. We agree with the district court that, given this low threshold, it is likely that at least with respect to some ingredients or combination of ingredients, DPH would find that there is a reasonable scientific basis to conclude that disclosure could reduce health risks, and hence that a recommendation in favor of disclosure is a probability. As for the Attorney General's resolution of the taking issue, here, too, we agree with the district court that, given his position in this litigation, it is predictable once the DPH makes the requisite determination based on reasonable scientific evidence. See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 151-52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth argues that because a 1999 amendment to the regulations would require a stay of public disclosure if the Manufacturers filed a complaint, see Mass. Regs. Code tit. 105, &#167; 660.200(g)(2), disclosure is not inevitable. Whether this amendment will be effective has yet to be determined by the state courts. However, the Disclosure Act itself states that ingredient information \"shall be\" public records after DPH and the Attorney General have performed their respective tasks, and as a public record, its production and disclosure could be compelled, notwithstanding a claim to trade secret protection, by anyone requesting it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Moreover, the Manufacturers' taking claim is not limited to public disclosure by DPH. They contend that the required submission of ingredient information itself impairs their trade secrets because DPH has failed to adopt adequate security procedures to protect the information's confidentiality. Since their claim also turns on the submission without adequate security procedures (i.e., satisfactory encryption technology and fingerprint readers) and not simply on the public disclosure of ingredients, the sixty-day stay provision, even if valid, is not wholly dispositive. See United States v. Geophysical Corp. of Alaska, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"434742\"><a href=\"/opinion/434742/united-states-of-america-v-geophysical-corporation-of-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">732</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span>, 698 (9th Cir. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth further argues that under the Disclosure Act, DPH may release information about ingredients that are not trade secrets. Of course, as the Manufacturers point out, DPH does not need the Disclosure Act to publish information in the public domain. The Manufacturers, moreover, dispute that DPH could make such tailored disclosures without risk to trade secrets because they claim each ingredient in any particular brand alone to be a trade secret. In any event, even assuming that DPH could make ingredient disclosures that contain no secrets, this is not a case like Williamson County because there is \"no question here about how the regulations at issue [apply] to the particular [property] at issue.\" Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118116\"><a href=\"/opinion/118116/suitum-v-tahoe-regional-planning-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 739 (1997). Both sides moved for summary judgment and no claim is made that further administrative proceedings are contemplated before the Disclosure Act is applied to the Manufacturers. See Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149. Whether the required disclosures encompass trade secrets and whether they constitute takings are questions of law ripe for adjudication. Knowing the exact nature and character of the property that may become implicated or the exact economic impact will not change the constitutional inquiry. No further factual development is shown to be necessary, particularly considering that the Manufacturers' claim rests not only on the ultimate disclosure by DPH but also on the adverse consequences of having to submit trade secret information to it without security precautions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the second ripeness prong--the hardship faced by the Manufacturers if decision is delayed. Delay would put the Manufacturers on the \"horns of a dilemma.\" Stern, 214 F.3d at 11. It would force the Manufacturers to choose between abandoning the Massachusetts market altogether or submitting trade secrets to DPH and risking their diminution or destruction. We conclude that, given \"the fitness of the issues for judicial decision and the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration,\" Abbott Labs., 387 U.S. at 149, the claims are ripe for review. See Suitum, 520 U.S. at 743-44 (\"'[W]here a regulation requires an immediate and significant change in the plaintiffs' conduct of their affairs with serious penalties attached to noncompliance,' hardship has been demonstrated.\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.</p>\n    <p>UNCONSTITUTIONAL TAKING</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The taking issue came before us in Philip Morris II in the context of the Commonwealth's appeal from the entry of a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the Act.

In doing so, it relied on a line of cases addressing the validity of land use regulations, beginning with Agins v. City of Tiburon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110299\"><a href=\"/opinion/110299/agins-v-city-of-tiburon/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span> (1980), and on its interpretation of the decision in Ruckelshaus v.

The district court's analysis reflects the two prongs of takings jurisprudence: per se (or categorical) takings and regulatory takings. Government action categorically violates the Takings Clause if it results in the permanent physical occupation of property or if it denies the owner all economically beneficial use of his property. See Lucas v. S. C. Coastal Council, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112787\"><a href=\"/opinion/112787/lucas-v-south-carolina-coastal-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></a></span>, 1015 (1992). In these instances, known as per se takings, just compensation is required, no matter how minor the invasion or how great the public purpose served by the regulation. Id. In contrast, in noncategorical regulatory takings cases, courts must engage in an ad hoc, factual inquiry to determine whether the government regulation goes too far. Id.; see also Penn. Coal Co. v.

In Lucas, for example, the Court distinguished its taking analysis of a land use regulation from that of the government's exercise of its power to regulate, without compensation, the sale of goods in commerce. The Court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It seems to us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State in legitimate exercise of its police powers; \"[a]s long recognized, some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power.\" And in the case of personal property, by reason of the State's traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings, he ought to be aware of the possibility that new regulation might even render his property economically worthless (at least if the property's only economically productive use is sale or manufacture for sale). In the case of land, however we think the notion pressed by the Council that title is somehow held subject to the \"implied limitation\" that the State may subsequently eliminate all economically valuable use is inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause that has become part of our constitutional culture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">505 U.S. 1027-28 (citations omitted).

While a complete seizure of personal property may amount to a categorical taking, see, e.g., Armstrong, 364 U.S. at 46 (seizure of boats on which plaintiff held mechanics lien a taking); Nixon v.

Cir. 1992) (seizure of former President's papers a taking), we cannot conclude, under the reasoning of Lucas, that the regulation of personal property which may be destructive of the value of trade secret information can be regarded as such a taking. Rather, the Disclosure Act establishes a regulatory scheme conditioning the ability to sell tobacco products in Massachusetts on the reporting for potential public disclosure of trade secret information, deemed by the legislature to serve the interest of public health. Thus, in our view, the Disclosure Act does not result in a categorical taking. See Yee v.

Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 991. FIFRA required all pesticides sold in interstate or foreign commerce for use within the United States to be registered with the Secretary of Agriculture and appropriately labeled. Id. It also empowered the Secretary to require applicants for registration to submit testing data, including pesticide formulae and data on a pesticide's health, safety, and environmental impact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Id. The first version of FIFRA, in effect from 1947 to 1972, specifically prohibited public disclosure of any formula information, but was silent as to disclosure of health and safety data submitted by manufacturers with applications for registration. Id. In 1972, due to \"mounting public concern about the safety of pesticides and their effect on the environment,\" Congress amended FIFRA's statutory scheme to provide for more comprehensive regulation. Id. It specifically prohibited the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from publicly disclosing any health, safety, and environmental data submitted by manufacturers which, both in its judgment and the submitting manufacturer's, contained or related to \"trade secrets or commercial or financial information.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Id. at 992. The third version, adopted in 1978, \"provide[d] for disclosure of all health, safety, and environmental data . . ., notwithstanding the prohibition against disclosure of trade secrets\" contained elsewhere in the statute. Id. at 995-96. The provision did not authorize disclosure of information that would reveal \"manufacturing or quality control processes\" or the identity or percentage quantity of deliberately added inert ingredients unless the EPA \"first determined that the disclosure is necessary to protect against an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Id. at 996.

The Manufacturers argue that the determining factor in this portion of the court's holding was not that the company had notice that its data might be disclosed but that it received compensating benefits for permitting the data to be used by the EPA. Their argument not only lacks textual support but also flies in the face of the plain language of the Court's opinion. The Manufacturers look for support in a footnote in the Nollan opinion which contains a passing reference to Monsanto, stating that there \"we found merely that the Takings Clause was not violated by giving effect to the Government's announcement that application for 'the right to [the] valuable Government benefit' of obtaining registration of an insecticide would confer upon the Government a license to use and disclose the trade secrets contained in the application.\" Nollan, 483 U.S. at 833 n.2 (citation omitted). This passage is somewhat misleading because the words it quotes are not those of the Monsanto Court but rather those of the appellee Monsanto.

See Brief for Appellee 29. But Monsanto has not challenged the ability of the Federal Government to regulate the marketing and use of pesticides. Nor could Monsanto successfully make such a challenge, for such restrictions are the burdens we all must bear in exchange for \"'the advantage of living and doing business in a civilized community.'\" This is particularly true in an area, such as pesticide sale and use, that has long been the source of public concern and the subject of government regulation. That Monsanto is willing to bear this burden in exchange for the ability to market pesticides in this country is evidenced by the fact that it has continued to expand its research and development and to submit data to EPA despite the enactment of the 1978 amendments to FIFRA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Thus as long as Monsanto is aware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the conditions are rationally related to a legitimate Government interest, a voluntary submission of data by an applicant in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking.

Certainly this conclusion cannot be rested on the receipt of any valuable Government benefits, for the pre-1972 scheme offered Monsanto none in exchange for submitting its information. And the generalized, nonspecific trade secret protection under the Trade Secrets Act is indistinguishable from that offered by Massachusetts law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, under the statutory scheme in effect in the 1972-78 period, Monsanto had an opportunity to protect its trade secrets from disclosure by designating them as trade secrets when submitted. The statute gave Monsanto explicit assurance that the EPA was prohibited from disclosing publicly any data submitted by an applicant if both the applicant and the EPA determined they were trade secrets. The Court held that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">with respect to trade secrets submitted under the statutory regime in force [during the 1972-78 period], the Federal Government had explicitly guaranteed to Monsanto and other registration applicants an extensive measure of confidentiality and exclusive use. This explicit governmental guarantee formed the basis of a reasonable investment-backed expectation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1011.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the Court concluded that only the use or disclosure of data submitted by Monsanto during the 1972-78 period, designated on submission as trade secrets and used or disclosed in \"conflict[] with the explicit assurance of confidentiality or exclusive use contained in the statute,\" effected a taking; disclosure of data submitted during the pre-1972 or post-1978 period did not. Id. at 1013. This analysis leaves no room to argue that Massachusetts' general statutory and common law protections of trade secrets create a reasonable, investment-backed expectation.

Crampton, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">921</span></span>, 925 (Mass. 1972); Mass. Gen.

First, the court concluded, its practical effect would be to alter relationships in the market for tobacco products outside Massachussetts by depriving Manufacturers of the competitive advantage they would otherwise have in other markets by reason of their trade secrets. See Healy v. The Beer Inst., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112301\"><a href=\"/opinion/112301/healy-v-beer-institute/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, 339 (1989). Second, by conditioning the right to sell tobacco products on the surrender of valuable trade secrets, the Disclosure Act imposes a burden on commerce that exceeds its putative local benefits. See Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 142 (1970).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Extraterritorial Regulation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commerce Clause states: \"The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.  . . .\" U.S. Const. Art. I, &#167; 8 cl. 3. This affirmative grant of authority to Congress also encompasses an implicit \"dormant\" limitation on the authority of the states to enact legislation affecting interstate commerce. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 326. At the same time, the Supreme Court has long recognized that \"in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the state to make laws governing matters of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> So.

While that \"residuum\" is particularly strong when a state acts in the interest of health and consumer protection, a finding that it has acted to further these matters of legitimate concern does not automatically end the inquiry. See Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109703\"><a href=\"/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span>, 350 (1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have noted before that the prohibitions imposed upon state regulation by the Dormant Commerce Clause fall into three general categories. See Pharm. Research and Mfrs. of Am. v.

First, a state statute which has an \"extraterritorial reach,\" whether intended or not, is a per se violation of the Clause. Id. Thus, when a state statute regulates commerce occurring wholly outside the state's borders or when it has a practical effect of requiring out-of-state conduct to be carried on according to in-state terms, it will be invalid. Id. Second, if a statute discriminates against out-of-state commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests, it will be held invalid unless the state can \"show that it advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.\" Or.

Lastly, we apply a lower level of scrutiny when the state statute does not discriminate but has incidental effects on interstate commerce. Concannon, 249 F.3d at 80. \"Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\" Pike, 397 U.S. at 142.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manufacturers first argue that to require public disclosure of commercially important trade secrets negates the protection afforded by every other state. But the cases principally relied on do not support a finding of extraterritorial regulation. Those cases involved a particularized regulatory scheme--so-called price affirmation--requiring out-of-state shippers to affirm that their posted in-state prices for products are no higher than those in the bordering states. Healy, 491 U.S. at 325; see also Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111683\"><a href=\"/opinion/111683/brown-forman-distillers-corp-v-new-york-state-liquor-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span> (1986); Baldwin v.

In Healy, the Court struck down a Connecticut requirement that out-of-state beer shippers affirm that their posted prices in Connecticut were no higher than their lowest prices in any border state. 491 U.S. at 329. The Court found the statute to have extraterritorial effect by \"preventing brewers from undertaking competitive pricing [out-of-state] based on prevailing market conditions . . . [and] requir[ing] out-of-state shippers to forgo the implementation of competitive-pricing schemes in out-of-state markets because those pricing decisions are imported by statute into the Connecticut market regardless of local competitive conditions.\" Id. at 338-39.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find Healy and the other cases on which the Manufacturers rely to be inapposite. The reasoning underlying those decisions--all of which involved price controls, price affirmation, or price tying schemes--is wholly inapplicable to the Disclosure Act. A price control, affirmation or tying scheme restricts the advantage of interstate sellers in local markets by extending a state's control over prices across state lines, viz. to lower prices out-of-state, a shipper must lower its prices in the regulating state as well. See Healy, 491 U.S. at 326; Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 582; Baldwin, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></span>; see also Concannon, 249 F.3d at 81. The Disclosure Act (aside from having nothing to do with prices) does not purport to regulate across state lines, nor is it an attempt at economic protectionism by the Commonwealth; its out-of-state effect is merely incidental to an in-state (non-price) regulatory scheme and any resulting loss of competitive advantage is unrelated to interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Decisions involving other interstate transactions also help to illumine the principle of extraterritoriality and its inapplicability here.

Nevertheless, the Act itself is indifferent to sales occurring out-of-state.\"). The Disclosure Act does not require that out-of-state commerce in tobacco products be conducted according to in-state terms. It imposes no mandates or restrictions on other states. It simply requires that the Manufacturers, should they chose to do business in Massachusetts, provide additional ingredient information to the Commonwealth's health authorities. This may eventually impact the profits of some Manufacturers, but \"[s]imply because the manufacturers' profits might be negatively affected by the [statute], however, does not necessarily mean that the [statute] is regulating those profits.\" Concannon, 249 F.3d at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manufacturers' reliance on BMW of North America v.

Gore was a due process clause case, not a commerce clause case. It involved an Alabama punitive damage award against a national car distributor, BMW, whose policy of not informing dealers of minor pre-delivery damage was challenged by an Alabama customer. In the Supreme Court, Gore argued that the large punitive damage award was necessary to induce BMW to change a nationwide disclosure policy that, even if found unlawful in Alabama, was lawful in a number of states. The Court held that while Alabama could inflict penalties on those who transgress its laws, in the interest of protecting its consumers, it does not have the power to punish BMW for conduct that was lawful where it occurred and had no impact on Alabama or its residents. Id. at 572. Thus, Alabama could \"not impose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changing the tortfeasors' lawful conduct in other States.\" Id. at 572 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Disclosure Act bears no resemblance to the judgment imposed in Gore. First, the Commonwealth can hardly be deemed to be instituting \"economic penalties\" along the lines of those described in BMW. See S.D. Meyers, Inc. v. City and County of San Francisco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773638\"><a href=\"/opinion/773638/sd-myers-inc-v-city-and-county-of-san-francisco-and-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2001</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">664233</span></span> *8 (9th Cir.(Cal.)). The Disclosure Act, by providing for disclosure, may economically harm the Manufacturers, but it does not impose a \"legislatively authorized fine.\" BMW, 517 U.S. at 571. Second, even if we accept the Manufacturers' proposition, nothing in the record indicates, nor do the Manufacturers seriously contend, that the Commonwealth intends to affect national tobacco policy. Rather, it aims to protect its own consumers and, presumably, through future savings in medical expenses should the education effort reduce tobacco use, its economy. BMW, 517 U.S. at 571. This surely does not offend the principles of comity and state sovereignty referred to in BMW. Moreover, even if the due process analysis were relevant in this context, we find Osborn v. Ozlin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103344\"><a href=\"/opinion/103344/osborn-v-ozlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span> (1940), more to the point:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the question is not whether what Virginia has done will restrict appellants' freedom of action outside Virginia by subjecting the exercise of such freedom to financial burdens.

Thus, the aggregate reporting required by the federal schemes, lumping together some 700 ingredients without indication which are found in which brand, would certainly not achieve \"the hoped-for benefit\" of the statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> This is so even though, as the court explained, \"consumers already have the ability to compare brands on the basis of the most notoriously harmful aspects of every brand, such as nicotine and tar.\" The aim of the Disclosure Act is educating Massachusetts consumers and helping them to choose less harmful brands, taking into account not only advertised nicotine and tar ratings but also the synergistic effects of various additives, such as those enhancing the delivery of \"free\" nicotine to the consumer (thus making deceptive the \"light\" and \"ultra light\" labels on many brands). Without brand-specific ingredient lists, researchers do not know which combinations to test and are left to guess which additives might co-exist in certain formulas on the market; like the Manufacturers' competitors, they cannot reverse engineer a formula and thus any health research they conduct is difficult and at best inexact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Brand-specific information in order of magnitude would enable DPH to use its resources most efficiently by targeting the most popular brands, focusing on those ingredients present in the highest quantity to serve the Act's purpose of providing information to consumers about the health risks of particular brands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, disclosure under the Disclosure Act will put consumers in a better position to know if their brand contains harmful additives, and to assess the health risks involved. Because we find that no less burdensome alternative has been shown to effect the Commonwealth's goal \"as well,\" Pike, 397 U.S. at 142, we hold that the Disclosure Act does not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause.

Unlike the additives in cigarettes and cigars, smokeless tobacco additives are not burned in a manner that creates additional dangerous byproducts. From this, the smokeless tobacco producers argue that the Commonwealth has a lesser interest in requiring the public disclosure of their ingredient lists. We disagree. Although the approved additives may be comparatively harmless when consumed alone and in unburned form, the DPH could conclude under the applicable standard that their use in smokeless tobacco products presents a public health concern. See, e.g., 61 Fed. Reg. 45.108-16 (analyzing manner in which smokeless tobacco additives have been utilized to manipulate the delivery of nicotine into the bloodstream). Thus, the Commonwealth has a significant interest in \"further[ing] the accumulation of knowledge about the health risks of smokeless tobacco use, particularly the possible hazards of substances added to tobacco to enhance flavor and for other purposes.\" Philip Morris I, 121 F.3d at 66 n.17 (quoting S.Rep.No. 99-209 at 14 (1986), reprinted in 1986 u.s.c.c.a.n.7, 13).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn25\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25_ref\">25</a>\n        <p> The Manufacturers also point to the Texas Statute as a less burdensome alternative.

My colleagues have grappled with it, and I share their view on two of the questions before us. First, the issues are ripe for determination. Second, the Act does not offend the Commerce Clause (in my judgment, it would be strange to hold that the Act unduly burdened commerce in trade secrets when there is no evidence that the trade secrets in dispute here are, or have been, traded or sold in commerce).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's resolution of the Takings Clause is another matter. In holding that the Commonwealth may use its police power to defeat the Manufacturers' takings claim, the majority sacrifices bedrock principles of individual property rights in order to uphold a creative, but at best marginally effective, response to a public health problem. Whatever one's personal feelings about smoking and the manufacturers of cigarettes and other tobacco products -- and I am no great fan of either -- the Constitution compels a state to compensate these manufacturers whenever it unabashedly takes their property for public use. In turning a deaf ear to this constitutional compulsion, I fear that they have fallen into an ancient trap. See East India Co. v. Paul, 13 Eng. Rep. 811, 821 (P.C. 1849) (Campbell, L.J.) (admonishing that \"it is the duty of all Courts of Justice to take care, for the general good of the community, that hard cases do not make bad law\"). Because the majority's holding allows states to ransack the trade secrets of virtually any business without providing even minimal recompense, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before proceeding to address the takings issue, I think it is useful to narrow my differences with my colleagues. We agree that information provided to DPH under the Act inevitably will be disclosed to the public, and that such information will include valuable trade secrets, susceptible to destruction if so exposed. With this in mind, I believe that this court's prior opinion in Philip Morris, Inc. v. Harshbarger, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758794\"><a href=\"/opinion/758794/philip-morris-incorporated-v-scott-harshbarger-attorney-general-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1998) (Philip Morris II), provides the correct interpretation and application of the Takings Clause vis-a-vis the Manufacturers' trade secrets. As that opinion explains, the Supreme Court's multifaceted decision in Monsanto requires that the government provide a benefit of real value to a private party whenever the government divulges that party's trade secrets (and, thus, takes its property). See id. at 676.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather than repastinating this well-ploughed ground, I think that my time (and the reader's) is better spent elaborating upon what I perceive to be the three major errors in the majority's analysis of this issue: (1) the failure to acknowledge the full extent of the Manufacturers' property interest in their trade secrets; (2) the restriction of the per se takings doctrine to real property interests; and (3) the conclusion, under the regulatory takings doctrine, that the Act comports with the teachings of Monsanto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In my view, the majority starts off on the wrong foot: my colleagues do not properly distinguish the Manufacturers' property interest in their trade secrets from the Manufacturers' property interest in their tobacco products. Massachusetts law long has protected trade secrets as property. See Jet Spray Cooler, Inc. v. Crampton, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1349</span></span>, 1354-55 &amp; n.8 (Mass. 1979) (detailing the extensive historical case law and statutory protections of trade secrets in Massachusetts). Such a trade secret -- one that has achieved the status of a property interest under state law -- is, in and of itself, property for the purposes of the Takings Clause. See Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1003-04. Hence, the Takings Clause should apply to such trade secrets independent of the holders' property rights in the products that embody them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That seems fairly straightforward. It seems equally straightforward that the extent of the holder's interest in a trade secret typically is defined by the extent to which the holder protects that interest from disclosure to others. Id. at 1002. These verities, coupled with the majority's concession that the Act may well result in revealing the Manufacturers' trade secrets to the public, ante at 53-54, point unerringly to the conclusion that the Commonwealth, by making such revelations, will drain all economic value from the Manufacturers' property interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is most curious, then, that the majority writes around this rather blatant deprivation of a recognized property interest, treating the Manufacturers' interest in their trade secrets as a sort of quasi-interest, protected only to the extent that tobacco products are protected. To this end, the majority characterizes the Act as \"a regulatory scheme conditioning the ability to sell tobacco products in Massachusetts on the reporting for potential public disclosure of trade secret information, deemed by the legislature to serve the interest of public health,\" ante at 56, and declares that \"the Manufacturers have no cognizable property right in their brand-specific ingredient information in the face of state health and safety regulatory authority,\" id. at 32 n.21. Under the majority's interpretation, the property interest in a trade secret lasts only until the state determines that it will regulate the product in which the trade secret is incorporated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I cannot accede to this resupinate reasoning. Property interests are fashioned, and their contours etched, by state law. See Bd. of Regents v. Roth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108608\"><a href=\"/opinion/108608/board-of-regents-of-state-colleges-v-roth/\"><span class=\"volume\">408</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 577 (1972). Under Massachusetts law, companies have interests in their trade secrets quite apart from their interests in the products to which those secrets relate, see Jet Spray, 385 Mass. at 166 n.8, and federal courts are obliged to follow this line of authority in determining whether the destruction of trade secrets constitutes a taking. Consequently, we must analyze a state's enforced disclosure of a trade secret without regard to the product in which that trade secret is embodied. When my colleagues note that the Manufacturers are regulated in other areas of their business and then treat that fact as dispositive of the takings claim, they act entirely without support in the reported cases and, in the bargain, violate a fundamental postulate of Takings Clause jurisprudence: that \"a sovereign, by ipse dixit, may not transform private property into public property without compensation.\" Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1012 (citation and internal punctuation omitted). And this extraordinary attempt to carve out a judge-made exception for cases in which a trade secret relates to a regulated product is bad policy as well as bad law: given that virtually every sector of life is subject to government regulation, the majority's holding would permit a state to violate the trade secrets of nearly every legitimate business without providing compensation so long as the state is acting under its police power.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aligning the analytic framework in what I believe to be the proper fashion has important consequences. To the extent that a property interest in a trade secret is independent from the holder's property interest in its tobacco products, the Act is patently an expropriation of the former interest and requires compensation under the Takings Clause. See Lane v. Commonwealth, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1281</span></span>, 1283 (Mass. 1988) (\"The idea that agents of the government could properly seize and use property of a citizen without legislative or common law authority and without compensation is unacceptable.

Under the per se takings doctrine, as I understand it, government action is \"compensable without case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced in support of the restraint.\" Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112787\"><a href=\"/opinion/112787/lucas-v-south-carolina-coastal-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1003</span></a></span>, 1015 (1992).

Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110783\"><a href=\"/opinion/110783/loretto-v-teleprompter-manhattan-catv-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span>, 441 <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110783\"><a href=\"/opinion/110783/loretto-v-teleprompter-manhattan-catv-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3164</span></a></span> (1982), or establishes a rule (as, say, by enacting a law or promulgating a regulation) that deprives the property of all economically viable use, Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1027. Because the majority now holds -- mistakenly, in my view -- that the per se takings doctrine does not apply to the confiscation of the Manufacturers' trade secrets, ante at 56-57, I discuss the matter here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In holding that the Act does not effect a per se taking, the majority rejects the Loretto branch of the per se takings doctrine, declaring that this case does not fit within the supposedly essential rationale of physical invasion cases: that an individual should not bear a public burden alone when that burden should be borne by the public as a whole. Ante at 56. My colleagues then reject the Lucas branch of the doctrine by repeating their original mistake: they see the deprivation of the Manufacturers' trade secrets as part of a larger picture involving the regulation of tobacco. Consistent with this approach, my colleagues read Lucas narrowly and limit per se takings under that doctrinal branch to claims involving land use regulations in contradistinction to claims arising out of \"the government's exercise of its power to regulate, without compensation, the sale of goods in commerce.\" Ante at 55-56.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I take the position opposite to the majority. Even though state law defines the boundaries of property, \"a State may not sidestep the Takings Clause by disavowing traditional property interests long recognized under state law.\" Phillips v. Wash. Legal Found., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118226\"><a href=\"/opinion/118226/phillips-v-washington-legal-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, 167 (1998). Here, then, we must analyze the per se takings doctrine in light of the long-recognized property interest imbued in trade secrets under Massachusetts law. That analysis indicates to me that the public disclosure of the Manufacturers' trade secrets likely constitutes a per se taking under both the Loretto and Lucas strands of the doctrine. On the one hand, the government has taken the valuable property of a business (i.e., its trade secrets) and converted that property to public use, much like an enforced permanent easement that works a physical occupation of a tract of land. See Nollan v. Cal. Coastal Comm'n, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111958\"><a href=\"/opinion/111958/nollan-v-california-coastal-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span>, 831 (1987). On the other hand, the Act may be seen as a means of exhibiting the Manufacturers' trade secrets to the public at large and draining them of their inherent value, in the same way that an overly intrusive land use regulation may deprive a parcel of real property of all economically viable use. I discuss each of these scenarios in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Permanent occupation. In Loretto, the Court made clear the distinctions between a permanent occupation, a transient invasion, and a regulation that restricts the use of property. 458 U.S. at 430. It first distinguished a permanent occupation from a temporary one on the ground that, in the former case, no balancing test was needed; rather, the occupation, in and of itself, triggered the right to compensation. Id. at 432. The Court then distinguished a permanent occupation from a regulation restricting property use on the ground that, in the former situation, \"the government does not simply take a single 'strand' from the 'bundle' of property rights: it chops through the bundle, taking a slice of every strand.\" Id. at 435. Critical to this last analysis is the right to exclude others from the property, \"traditionally . . . considered one of the most treasured strands in an owner's bundle of property rights.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The public disclosure of a closely held trade secret is much like a permanent occupation. The disclosure is irreversible and the information thereafter is shared by all. Even though the Loretto Court routinely placed the adjective \"physical\" next to the term \"occupation,\" there is no logical rationale as to why such an occupation must be corporeal. Given that the relevant definition of property is found in an independent source of law -- in this case, the Massachusetts law of property -- a nonphysical occupation of nonphysical property should demand compensation just as much as a physical occupation of physical property. The property owner's right to exclude others -- the critical aspect of most property rights, and of crucial importance here -- has dissolved just as completely in the one case as in the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the case law on this point admittedly is sparse, I find Nixon v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594395\"><a href=\"/opinion/594395/richard-nixon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1269</span></a></span> (D.C. Cir. 1992), instructive. There, the court of appeals held that the government's taking of presidential papers constituted a per se taking. Id. at 1284-87. In so holding, the court rejected the argument that the per se takings doctrine applied only to the physical occupation of real property:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he Government's inference that the per se doctrine must be limited to real property is without basis in the law, and we see no reason to give it one. One may be just as permanently and completely dispossessed of personal property as of real property. Any distinction along these lines would be purely artificial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1285. The court then proceeded to find a taking, stressing President Nixon's loss of his \"paramount property right\" -- the right to exclude others from his papers. See id. at 1286-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same rationale applies here. Even if the Act does not grant the Commonwealth exclusive control of the confiscated information, it nonetheless deprives the Manufacturers of the right to exclude others. Much like the landowner who is compelled to grant an unwanted easement, the Manufacturers still will have access to their hard-won property, but will be forced to share that property with the public (including their competitors). As such, the Act effects a permanent occupation and the Manufacturers must be compensated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Destruction of all economically viable use. Since the intrinsic value of a trade secret mounts in direct proportion to the extent that it is secret, the Act also works a per se taking by displaying trade secrets to the public at large and thus depriving the Manufacturers of the entire economic value of their property. Under the applicable precedents, the Commonwealth \"may resist compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into the nature of the owner's estate shows that the proscribed use interests were not part of [what he owned].\" Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1027. Given that the states have a traditionally high degree of control over commercial dealings, a state may regulate the sale of personal property even though its only economically productive use is its sale and the regulation makes the property worthless. Id. at 1027-28. A good example of this phenomenon is the right to regulate the sale of narcotics or particular types of weapons. Apart from restrictions on sale, however, the justification for other limitations that deprive the property of all economic value must be found within the parameters of the property interest or within the background principles of the state's property law. See id. at 1029-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I believe that in limiting Lucas and its progeny to land use cases, the majority has adopted an overly literal view. While Lucas, Dolan, and Nollan all involved land use regulations, there is no reason to think that their teachings pertain only to real property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> As said, state law defines property interests for purposes of the Takings Clause. Webb's Fabulous Pharms., Inc. v. Beckwith, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110362\"><a href=\"/opinion/110362/webbs-fabulous-pharmacies-inc-v-beckwith/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 161 (1980). Thus, since Massachusetts defines a trade secret as property, common sense suggests that Lucas should apply. Indeed, the Lucas Court's avowed deference to background principles of state property law in determining whether the state has effected a total taking makes this conclusion nearly irresistible. Whether one looks at a taking of land or a taking of some other form of property, the critical question -- leaving aside the sale of personal property -- is whether the challenged regulation prohibits a productive use that previously was permissible under relevant principles of state property law. See Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1029-30. As such, Lucas speaks to the character of the governmental action, not the character of the affected property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Lucas branch of the per se takings doctrine, the Act fails. The Manufacturers own the trade secrets. Their property interest in the embodied data is irretrievably lost once the secrets are disclosed to others. See Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1011. That being so, the background principles of Massachusetts property law compel the conclusion that the government cannot destroy all economically valuable uses of the Manufacturers' trade secrets without providing compensation. After all, Massachusetts law traditionally has protected such secrets from invasion by outside parties, and there is no historical precedent for making an exception here. See Lane, 517 N.E.2d at 1282-83. Thus, if we are to pass on whether the Act effects a per se taking under the Lucas branch of the doctrine, we must answer in the affirmative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I turn now to the majority's third major mistake. In Philip Morris II, we stated that \"the Commonwealth's unilateral announcement that the privilege of continuing to do business in Massachusetts henceforth will entail the yielding of a tobacco company's trade secrets cannot, in itself, establish a benefit sufficient to support a voluntary exchange within the Monsanto paradigm.\" 159 F.3d at 677. The majority now backtracks on this pronouncement, offering three reasons for doing so. In my judgment, none of these reasons warrant such resipiscence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the majority cites language from Monsanto purportedly establishing that the right to sell tobacco products within Massachusetts is a \"benefit.\" Ante at 59-60. Placing this argument into perspective requires an understanding of the tripartite structure of the Monsanto opinion. In the period before 1972, Monsanto and other pesticide manufacturers submitted trade secrets to federal authorities without any expectation that they would be kept secret. When the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) revealed this data, there was no taking.  Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1013. In the period between 1972 and 1978, the EPA gave explicit assurances that it would not disclose the submitted trade secrets. Failure to keep this pledge, the Court held, would result in an unconstitutional taking unless the affected manufacturers were adequately compensated for the loss in market value engendered by the EPA's disclosure. Id. at 1013-14. In the period after 1978, the EPA in fact compensated the pesticide manufacturers for disclosure of their trade secrets, and the Court held that this arrangement did not effect an unconstitutional taking because the compensation was just. Id. at 1007-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority, in a somewhat misleading fashion, quotes language applicable to the third Monsanto period and deems it dispositive: \"as long as Monsanto is aware of the conditions under which the data are submitted, and the conditions are rationally related to a legitimate Government interest, a voluntary submission of data by an applicant in exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can hardly be called a taking.\" Ante at 59 (quoting Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1007). Starting from this premise, the majority concludes that the \"benefit\" which Monsanto received in exchange for the submission of data -- the ability to market pesticides in this country -- is no different from the \"benefit\" that the Manufacturers receive under the Act, namely, \"the ability to market tobacco products in Massachusetts.\" Ante at 59.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a quantum leap, unjustified either in law or in logic. I think that we had it right the first time, when we stated that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he 1972-78 period presents the closest, most persuasive analogy to the situation created by Section 307B. The FIFRA scheme then in effect provided specific protections for trade secret information -- and the Court determined that pesticide registrants might reasonably rely on these protections. The statutory and common law protections for trade secret information in place in the Commonwealth create a very similar prophylaxis and thus form the basis for a reasonable expectation of continued confidentiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Philip Morris II, 159 F.3d at 678 (citation omitted). In the period after 1978, by contrast, the EPA provided compensation to pesticide manufacturers in the form of exclusive use rights to the data for ten years and compensation from later applicants for the next five years. Though the benefit was limited in scope and duration, Monsanto at least received something over and above the status quo: exclusive use rights and enforced compensation from competitors may not seem like much in the abstract, but they were more than what the pesticide manufacturers had before 1978.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority attempts to draw a parallel here, visualizing the Commonwealth as conferring a benefit on the Manufacturers when it allows them to continue selling tobacco products in Massachusetts. This creates a false dichotomy. As we have said, the privilege of continuing to conduct one's business \"simply is not analogous, either in kind or in degree, to the benefit that effected the exchange and extinguished the takings claim in Monsanto.\" Philip Morris II, 159 F.3d at 677. Because the Act does not offer the Manufacturers anything more than what they already have, it does not afford due compensation for a taking of valuable property rights. Id. at 678. We would not permit a valuable parcel of land to be taken at a zero valuation simply because the sovereign promised to let the owner use it in common with the general public. It follows inexorably that we should not permit the sovereign to take trade secrets at a zero valuation, publicly disclose them, and pay no compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second pillar on which the majority's Monsanto analysis rests is the holding in Corn Products Refining Company v. Eddy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"99354\"><a href=\"/opinion/99354/corn-products-refining-co-v-eddy/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">427</span></a></span>, 431-32 (1919), that a property right in a trade secret is subject to the state's police power.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a> Ante at 60-61. The majority touts Corn Products as \"a decision whose age has not staled its authority,\" and proclaims that it \"underlines the sweep of the Monsanto holding.\" Ante at 60.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I beg to differ. If Corn Products has not completely staled, there is at least some mildew around the edges. In the eighty-two years since the publication of that opinion, Takings Clause and trade secret jurisprudence has developed in ways not foreseen by the Corn Products Court. As part of this progression, Monsanto substantially limited the breadth of Corn Products, citing it only in the context of the third period (i.e., after the EPA fully compensated the pesticide manufacturers for the taking). Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1007-08. Had Corn Products been able to carry the weight attributed to it by the majority, then the EPA would not have been forced to compensate Monsanto for divulging trade secrets in the second period (1972-1978). To my mind, the portion of Corn Products cited in Monsanto and by the majority here -- one paragraph in all -- now stands only for the proposition that the state is free to use its police power to force a manufacturer to list product ingredients on the label so long as the state has compensated the manufacturer for the forced disclosure of any trade secrets. There is no such compensation here and, accordingly, Corn Products is inapposite.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1\" id=\"fn5-1_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the majority analogizes the Act to the pre-1972 regulatory scheme in Monsanto, presuming that the \"nonspecific trade secret protection under the [federal] Trade Secrets Act is indistinguishable from that offered by Massachusetts law.\" Ante at 60-61. The majority reasons that because the Act does not provide assurances to the Manufacturers that the trade secrets will be protected, the Commonwealth does not have to compensate them.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1\" id=\"fn6-1_ref\">6</a> Ante at 61-62. Accordingly, the Act \"is a valid exercise of the police power and, in the absence of explicit guarantees of confidentiality from the Commonwealth, does not effect an unconstitutional taking.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This rationale is alarming. As I understand the majority, any time the state chooses to deprive a corporation of a trade secret without compensation, its safest course, constitutionally speaking, will be to do so without offering the slightest assurance that the trade secret will remain confidential. This view of the law is wholly unsupported by Monsanto: in the period before 1972, the pesticide manufacturers were on notice that their trade secrets would not be kept confidential because the EPA engaged in the widespread practice of using data submitted by one pesticide manufacturer in evaluating the application of a subsequent applicant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1\" id=\"fn7-1_ref\">7</a> Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1009-10 &amp; n.14. Thus, this portion of the Monsanto opinion stands for the proposition that a party does not have a reasonable expectation that a trade secret will remain in the bosom of the lodge when the government has been disclosing the information all along. That is not the situation here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority's reasoning on this point has a second fault: it presumes that courts measure the reasonable investment-backed expectation of an aggrieved party at the time the state promulgates a regulation that effects a taking. True to this presumption, the majority analyzes the reasonable investment-backed expectation here only after the Act has been passed, and accordingly, finds that there is no such expectation. I believe, however, that we should follow the Second Circuit's lead and hold that \"the critical time for considering investment-backed expectations is the time a property is acquired, not the time the challenged regulation is enacted.\" Meriden Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Co. v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701737\"><a href=\"/opinion/701737/the-meriden-trust-and-safe-deposit-company-cenvest-inc-of-meriden/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 454 (2d Cir. 1995). One sound reason for adhering to this view is that the majority's contrary interpretation robs the concept of \"reasonable investment-backed expectation\" of any meaning; if a reasonable investment-backed expectation only commences when the challenged regulation comes into play, then such expectations are always subject to the whims of the state. If this prong of the regulatory taking inquiry is to have any import, the court must examine the reasonable investment-backed expectations at the time that the investment is backed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pulling these threads together, I think it is perspicuous that the Act dashes the Manufacturers reasonable investment-backed expectations. Much like the pesticide manufacturers in Monsanto during the 1972-1978 period, the Manufacturers invested millions of dollars in developing ingredient combinations whilst relying on the trade secret protections embedded in Massachusetts law. Nothing in the Commonwealth's practice or in its jurisprudence gave them reason to suspect that the Commonwealth would later demand the revelation of the fruits of their labor for the public good.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the Manufacturers have gone to great lengths to keep their secrets and have done so without any reason to expect governmental interference, much less government-enforced dissemination of that confidential information. Yet the Commonwealth is on the brink of taking those secrets, without offering in return anything above what the Manufacturers already have. I would find this to be a regulatory taking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1\" id=\"fn8-1_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I do not dispute that tobacco products are hazardous to health, or that the Commonwealth may regulate tobacco products, or that the Commonwealth may legislate with respect to the trade secrets of the Manufacturers, or even that the Commonwealth has the power under the Constitution to seize the trade secrets and then disclose them to the public at large in exact detail. Should it choose this course, however, the Commonwealth must accord the Manufacturers' property interests the same respect that it would show to the property interests of any other legitimate person, firm, or corporation. To that end, the Commonwealth must provide adequate compensation to the Manufacturers for the trade secrets that it destroys. Because the Act and this court's opinion permit the Commonwealth to shirk this obligation, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Monsanto Court did not address whether the taking of a trade secret could constitute a per se taking. We avoided that question in Philip Morris II, 159 F.3d at 674 n.4, finding the Manufacturers' challenge to the Act likely to succeed under the regulatory takings doctrine. I continue to believe that Philip Morris II stayed the proper course, but the majority's conclusory statement of views on the per se takings doctrine cannot be left unanswered.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> To be sure, Lucas makes a brief distinction between personal property and landed interests, but the distinction is between the restrictions on commercial sale of personal property and the restrictions on commercial sale of land. See Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1027-28.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Significant to this analysis, the Supreme Court found that these benefices were enough to compensate Monsanto because Monsanto had continued submitting trade secrets after 1978. Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1007. In other words, by silently capitulating to the exchange, Monsanto lost the right later to claim that the government had not provided proper compensation. Here, however, the Manufacturers have fought the Commonwealth's proffered exchange tooth and nail, without the slightest sign of acquiescence.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In Corn Products, the Court permitted Kansas to breach trade secrets, vouchsafing that \"[t]he right of a manufacturer to maintain secrecy as to his compounds and processes must be held subject to the right of the State, in the exercise of its police power and in the promotion of fair dealing, to require that the nature of the product be fairly set forth.\" 249 U.S. at 431-32.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5-1_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Despite the fact that the jurisprudence of the Takings Clause evolved rather dramatically during the second half of the twentieth century, the only Supreme Court case from the last sixty years cited by the majority to support its favorable interpretation of Corn Products is Andrus v. Allard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110156\"><a href=\"/opinion/110156/andrus-v-allard/\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span> (1979). That case, which held that the federal government could prohibit the sale of bird feathers without offending the Takings Clause, id. at 64-68, has no bearing here: Massachusetts has not attempted a mere prohibition on the sale of trade secrets; instead, it has paved the way for the utter destruction of their value.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6-1_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The majority implies that Massachusetts law has carved an exception to the inviolability of trade secrets when that information is submitted to government pursuant to law. Ante at 61-62. The citations provided, however, in no way support such a remarkable proposition. At most, these cases suggest that the state may deprive an individual of a property interest in his trade secret without offending state law. See Gen. Chem. Corp. v. Dep't of Env. Quality Eng'g, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1988602\"><a href=\"/opinion/1988602/general-chemical-v-dept-of-envtl-quality/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 185 (Mass. App. Ct. 1985). They do not (and could not) grant the state permission to ignore the mandates of the Takings Clause when it deprives the individual of this property interest.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7-1_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The majority's citation to Justice O'Connor's dissent as an explanation of the rationale adopted by the Monsanto majority, ante at 61 n.18 (citing Monsanto, 467 U.S. at 1023 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)), cannot be allowed to obfuscate what the Monsanto Court actually did and what it held. In any event, were we to follow Justice O'Connor's suggestion and look at the protections given to trade secrets by Massachusetts law (as opposed to how trade secrets are treated by the government in practice), we would reach the same conclusion: the Manufacturers have a reasonable investment-backed expectation that their trade secrets will remain inviolate. See Philip Morris II, 159 F.3d at 678.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8-1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8-1_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> The majority summarily disposes of the Manufacturers' due process claim, reasoning that the lack of a cognizable property interest in the trade secrets defeats such a claim. Ante at 61-62 n.21. Because I believe that the Manufacturers have such a property interest, I also believe that the Commonwealth may not deprive them of that interest without the necessary procedural safeguards, i.e., a hearing. Mathews v. Eldridge, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109382\"><a href=\"/opinion/109382/mathews-v-eldridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span>, 333 (1976). The essential requirement of this hearing is that it affords notice and an opportunity to respond. Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, 546 (1985). Whenever feasible, it must occur prior to the deprivation. Zinermon v. Burch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620710\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620710/zinermon-v-burch/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 132 (1990). Those safeguards are not in evidence here, at least as to the procedures laid out by the Attorney General for the protection of trade secrets furnished by the Manufacturers.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
