Clemente's   disability  retirement   and  group\r\n\ninsurance benefits because of his conviction of a crime  four\r\n\nyears earlier.   Clemente  had been federally  prosecuted and\r\n\nconvicted for his involvement in the theft and sale of police\r\n\npromotional  exams, a  scheme  popularly known  as the  \"Exam\r\n\nScam.\"  See generally  United States v. Doherty, 867  F.2d 47\r                                                           \r\n\n(1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 492  U.S. 918 (1989).   Clemente's\r                                     \r\n\ncrime, the Board reasoned, involved the  funds or property of\r\n\na state agency and so justified the termination of Clemente's\r\n\nbenefits under Mass. Gen. L. ch. 32,   15(1),  (3).  Clemente\r\n\ndid not receive prior notice of the impending termination  of\r\n\nbenefits; nor was he given an  opportunity to be heard.  Four\r\n\nyears after the termination,  after Clemente had appealed the\r\n\ndecision through the state administrative process,  the Board\r\n\nfinally held a hearing.  It then determined that Clemente was\r\n\nnot entitled  to receive the  benefits the Board  had earlier\r\n\nstopped paying.  The Board also determined that Clemente owed\r\n\nan  agency of  the  Commonwealth,  the Metropolitan  District\r\n\nCommission (\"MDC\"), sums in restitution for his crime.\r\n\n          In  the  interim, Clemente  had  filed  this action\r\n\nalleging  procedural and substantive  due process violations.\r\n\nThe district court held  that the Board's initial termination\r\n\nof  Clemente's  benefits  violated Clemente's  constitutional\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nright to procedural due process and  that the defendant Board\r\n\nmembers were individually liable.   The court determined that\r\n\nClemente's federal  damages were  the payments he  would have\r\n\nreceived  up  to the  time of  an  adequate hearing  and then\r\n\n\"offset\" the  damages by the restitutionary  amount the Board\r\n\nhad determined Clemente  owed to  the MDC on  account of  his\r\n\ncrimes,  an  amount  apparently   greater  than  the  damages\r\n\nsuffered.  Clemente  appeals from  the judgment,  complaining\r\n\nprimarily of the offset.  We affirm.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r\n\n          Clemente worked  as a  police officer with  the MDC\r\n\nuntil  May 28, 1983, when the Board granted him an accidental\r\n\ndisability   retirement  due   to  his   hypertension,  which\r\n\nprevented him  from working.  Clemente  thereafter received a\r\n\nmonthly allowance from the State Retirement System as well as\r\n\ngroup medical  insurance benefits  for himself and  his wife.\r\n\nIn  November  1986,  Clemente  pleaded guilty  to  a  federal\r\n\nracketeering charge.   He  had participated  in  a scheme  to\r\n\ndefraud  the  Commonwealth  by  stealing  police  promotional\r\n\nexams, giving or selling them to others, and altering scores.\r\n\nIn  1988,  the Board  requested  an  opinion from  the  State\r\n\nAttorney  General as  to  the  effect  of the  conviction  on\r\n\nClemente's entitlement  to  pension benefits.   The  Attorney\r\n\nGeneral  responded in June 1990, advising  the Board that the\r\n\nExam  Scam scheme, to the  extent that it actually succeeded,\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nwas  a crime that involved  MDC funds or  property within the\r\n\nmeaning of Mass. Gen. L. ch. 32,   15.1\r\n\n          In July  1990, without giving  Clemente notice that\r\n\nsuch an action was contemplated, the Board voted to terminate\r\n\nhis   benefits  based   upon  its   determination   that  his\r\n\nracketeering conviction was for an offense which involved the\r\n\nfunds  or property  of  the MDC.    The Board  then  notified\r\n\nClemente of its action and ceased paying benefits.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The relevant portions of Mass. Gen.  L. ch. 32,   15 read\r\nas follows:\r\n\n          (1)    Misappropriation  of Funds.    Any\r                                                       \r\n          member  who  has  been  charged  with the\r\n          misappropriation of funds or  property of\r\n          any  governmental  unit  in which  or  by\r\n          which he is employed  or was employed  at\r\n          the time of his retirement or termination\r\n          of service  . . . and who files a written\r\n          request  therefor  shall  be   granted  a\r\n          hearing  by the  board .  . .  .   If the\r\n          board after the hearing finds the charges\r\n          to be true, such member shall forfeit all\r\n          rights . . . to a retirement allowance or\r\n          to  a  return  of his  accumulated  total\r\n          deductions  . .  . to  the extent  of the\r\n          amount so found to be misappropriated and\r\n          to  the  extent  of   the  costs  of  the\r\n          investigation,  if any,  as found  by the\r\n          board. . . .\r\n\n          (3)      Forfeiture   of    Rights   upon\r                                                               \r\n          Conviction.  In no event shall any member\r                                \r\n          after  final  conviction  of  an  offense\r\n          involving  the  funds  or  property  of a\r\n          governmental  unit .  . . referred  to in\r\n          subdivision  (1)  of  this   section,  be\r\n          entitled   to    receive   a   retirement\r\n          allowance  or a return of his accumulated\r\n          total deductions  . . . unless  and until\r\n          full    restitution    for    any    such\r\n          misappropriation has been made.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          Clemente  appealed  to the  Contributory Retirement\r\n\nAppeal Board,  which, in September 1992,  remanded the matter\r\n\nto the  Board and  directed the  Board to  hold a  hearing if\r\n\nClemente so  requested.  In 1994, the  Board finally notified\r\n\nClemente of its intent  to initiate misappropriation  charges\r\n\nand then held  a hearing  upon his  request.   On January  4,\r\n\n1995,  the Board issued a  decision finding that Clemente had\r\n\nmisappropriated MDC funds and owed restitution to  the MDC in\r\n\nthe amount  of $239,146  plus interest and  ordered forfeited\r\n\nall his  rights to  his retirement allowance  and accumulated\r\n\ndeductions.2\r\n\n          In 1993,  while the state administrative action was\r\n\npending  but  before  the  Board  had  given  him  a hearing,\r\n\nClemente filed  this federal  action under  42 U.S.C.    1983\r\n\nagainst  the Commonwealth,  the  Board, and  the members  who\r\n\nserved on the Board  when Clemente's benefits were terminated\r\n\nin 1990.  Clemente claimed that the defendants terminated his\r\n\ndisability retirement allowance  and medical benefits without\r\n\nnotice  or  a  hearing, thus  violating  his  rights to  both\r\n\nsubstantive and procedural due process.  He also claimed that\r\n\nthe  termination  constituted   further  punishment  for  his\r\n\nparticipation in  the Exam Scam, thus violating  his right to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The Board found that \"Clemente misappropriated the amount\r\nof $216,175.00 from the  MDC, and that he is  responsible for\r\n$22,971.00 in  costs of investigation.   The total  amount of\r\nrestitution  due   the  MDC   is  the  principal   amount  of\r\n$239,146.00, plus interest.\"\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nbe free from double jeopardy.  He requested damages for these\r\n\nconstitutional violations.3  The district court dismissed the\r\n\nclaims against the Commonwealth and the Board, as well as the\r\n\nclaims  against   the  Board   members   in  their   official\r\n\ncapacities.  The Board members in their individual capacities\r\n\nare thus the only remaining defendants.\r\n\n          The district court withheld  decision on the matter\r\n\nuntil  after  the Board  issued  its  January 1995  decision.\r\n\nThereafter,  on  cross  motions  for  summary  judgment,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  held that  the Board had  violated Clemente's\r\n\nprocedural due process  rights by failing to give  him notice\r\n\nand  a   hearing  before  terminating  his   benefits.    The\r\n\ndefendants   did   not   dispute    that   Clemente   had   a\r\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest in the benefits,\r\n\nand that,  under state law, he was  entitled to notice and an\r\n\nopportunity  to  be heard  before  the  Board terminated  the\r\n\nbenefits.    The  district  court  rejected  the  defendants'\r\n\nargument  that   the  Board's   actions   were  \"random   and\r\n\nunauthorized\" acts that could  be cured by a post-deprivation\r\n\nhearing  under Parratt v.  Taylor, 451 U.S.  527, 541 (1981),\r                                             \r\n\noverruled in part on other  grounds, Daniels v. Williams, 474\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 327, 330 (1986), and rejected the defendants' claims  of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  In   his  complaint,  Clemente  also  sought  prospective\r\nrelief, but after  the Board  held a hearing  on the  matter,\r\nthese prayers were  not pursued, although they have  not been\r\nformally dismissed.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nqualified  immunity.    In  addition,  the  court  held  that\r\n\nClemente's  substantive  due  process  rights  had  not  been\r\n\nviolated,  and it  also rejected  his double  jeopardy claim,\r\n\nholding that  the termination  of payments was  not punitive,\r\n\nand  even if  it  were,  that  the  Board's  action  was  not\r\n\nunconstitutional  because the  criminal  prosecution and  the\r\n\ntermination  proceedings were brought by separate sovereigns.\r\n\n          The district court  accepted Clemente's  contention\r\n\nthat the \"deprivation decision could have been made no faster\r\n\nin  a  proper  fashion.\"     Therefore,  the  district  court\r\n\ncalculated damages from  the due process violation  to be the\r\n\npension benefits  Clemente would have received  from the time\r\n\nthe benefits were terminated until the January 1995 decision,\r\n\nas  well as  out-of-pocket medical  expenses that  would have\r\n\nbeen covered under  the health insurance  plan.  That  amount\r\n\nwas $104,064.85, plus interest.   However, the district court\r\n\nalso determined that \"[t]his amount may be used to offset the\r\n\nrestitution  amount   Clemente  owes  as  a   result  of  the\r\n\ndefendants'  January  4,  1995,   decision.\"    Clemente  has\r\n\nappealed  both the award of  the offset and  the rejection of\r\n\nhis double jeopardy claim.4\r\n\n                     II.  Double Jeopardy\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Defendants have not appealed from the judgment.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          Clemente  appeals the district court's holding that\r\n\nthe Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar the termination of his\r\n\nbenefits.     Even   assuming   arguendo  that   the  Board's\r                                                    \r\n\ntermination of Clemente's  benefits constituted  punishment,5\r\n\nthe  doctrine of  double  jeopardy does  not  apply to  suits\r\n\nbrought by separate sovereigns.  Abbate v. United States, 359\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 187, 194 (1959); United States v. 40 Moon Hill Road, 884\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 41, 43  (1st Cir.  1989).  Clemente  was convicted of  a\r\n\nfederal offense in federal court.  The Double Jeopardy Clause\r\n\ndoes not bar  later action by  the Commonwealth to  terminate\r\n\nbenefits and thereby recover sums it lost due to the offense,\r\n\neven if the termination were in part punitive.\r\n\n                       III.  The Offset\r\n\n          Clemente challenges  the  offset, arguing  that  it\r\n\nshould be  reversed because it  was not  timely pleaded6  and\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  The district court held  that the termination of benefits\r\nwas purely remedial because it found that \"[o]nce the MDC has\r\nbeen  fully reimbursed  for  the funds  or property  Clemente\r\nallegedly  misappropriated,  Clemente  will  be  entitled  to\r\nreceive the remainder of his pension payments.\"  This finding\r\nwas  apparently  based upon  a  1990  letter written  by  the\r\nBoard's  legal  counsel.     However,  in  its  January  1995\r\ndecision, the Board stated that \"[Clemente] is ineligible for\r\nany retirement allowance under  the provisions of sections 1-\r\n28,  regardless  of  whether  he ever  makes  restitution  or\r\nwhether  the Board  recovers  misappropriated funds  from the\r\nother  MDC  co-conspirators.\"     Because  we affirm  summary\r\njudgment  on  the  double  jeopardy  claim  on  the  separate\r\nsovereign theory, we need  not decide whether the termination\r\nwas punitive in nature.\r\n\n6.  Defendants  first raised  the  issue  in pleadings  filed\r\nafter  the summary judgment motion.  While the defendants ran\r\na risk in being  so dilatory, the district court  reached the\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nbecause  the  Board's  order  did  not  establish  a  legally\r\n\nenforceable  debt  for  the   amount  of  restitution.    The\r\n\ndefendants  counter by  characterizing  the district  court's\r\n\njudgment as a permanent injunction, warranted by the equities\r\n\nin the case,  and argue that the district court did not abuse\r\n\nits  equitable discretion  in formulating  such relief.   The\r\n\ndefendants  also argue  that  the offset  was appropriate  to\r\n\nprevent a windfall to Clemente.7\r\n\n          As the Supreme Court  said in Carey v.

The district  court order\r\n\nprovides a  mechanism for adjustment which,  depending on the\r\n\noutcome  of   that  appeal,  should  avoid   the  problem  of\r\n\noverpayment  to either  side.

Conclusion\r\n\n          We  conclude  that   the  district  court  properly\r\n\ngranted summary judgment  in favor of  the defendants on  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  double  jeopardy claim  and  did  not abuse  its\r\n\ndiscretion in fashioning the  remedial order.

For instance, if the  employer discovers\r\nthe after-acquired evidence  which would justify  termination\r\non  the  same  day  as  the  illegal  discharge,  or  shortly\r\nafterwards, plaintiff's back-pay damages would be nonexistent\r\nor minimal.\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n",

Clemente's disability retirement and group insurance benefits because of his conviction of a crime four years earlier.  Clemente had been federally prosecuted and convicted for his involvement in the theft and sale of police promotional exams, a scheme popularly known as the \"Exam Scam.\"  See generally United States v. Doherty, 867 F.2d 47 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 918 (1989).  Clemente's crime, the Board reasoned, involved the funds or property of a state agency and so justified the termination of Clemente's benefits under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 32, &#167; 15(1), (3).  Clemente did not receive prior notice of the impending termination of benefits;  nor was he given an opportunity to be heard.  Four years after the termination, after Clemente had appealed the decision through the state administrative process, the Board finally held a hearing.  It then determined that Clemente was not entitled to receive the benefits the Board had earlier stopped paying.  The Board also determined that Clemente owed an agency of the Commonwealth, the Metropolitan District Commission (\"MDC\"), sums in restitution for his crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interim, Clemente had filed this action alleging procedural and substantive due process violations.  The district court held that the Board's initial termination of Clemente's benefits violated Clemente's constitutional right to procedural due process and that the defendant Board members were individually liable.  The court determined that Clemente's federal damages were the payments he would have received up to the time of an adequate hearing and then \"offset\" the damages by the restitutionary amount the Board had determined Clemente owed to the MDC on account of his crimes, an amount apparently greater than the damages suffered.  Clemente appeals from the judgment, complaining primarily of the offset.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clemente worked as a police officer with the MDC until May 28, 1983, when the Board granted him an accidental disability retirement due to his hypertension, which prevented him from working.  Clemente thereafter received a monthly allowance from the State Retirement System as well as group medical insurance benefits for himself and his wife.  In November 1986, Clemente pleaded guilty to a federal racketeering charge.  He had participated in a scheme to defraud the Commonwealth by stealing police promotional exams, giving or selling them to others, and altering scores.  In 1988, the Board requested an opinion from the State Attorney General as to the effect of the conviction on Clemente's entitlement to pension benefits.  The Attorney General responded in June 1990, advising the Board that the Exam Scam scheme, to the extent that it actually succeeded, was a crime that involved MDC funds or property within the meaning of Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 32, &#167; 15.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1990, without giving Clemente notice that such an action was contemplated, the Board voted to terminate his benefits based upon its determination that his racketeering conviction was for an offense which involved the funds or property of the MDC. The Board then notified Clemente of its action and ceased paying benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clemente appealed to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board, which, in September 1992, remanded the matter to the Board and directed the Board to hold a hearing if Clemente so requested.  In 1994, the Board finally notified Clemente of its intent to initiate misappropriation charges and then held a hearing upon his request.  On January 4, 1995, the Board issued a decision finding that Clemente had misappropriated MDC funds and owed restitution to the MDC in the amount of $239,146 plus interest and ordered forfeited all his rights to his retirement allowance and accumulated deductions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, while the state administrative action was pending but before the Board had given him a hearing, Clemente filed this federal action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against the Commonwealth, the Board, and the members who served on the Board when Clemente's benefits were terminated in 1990.  Clemente claimed that the defendants terminated his disability retirement allowance and medical benefits without notice or a hearing, thus violating his rights to both substantive and procedural due process.  He also claimed that the termination constituted further punishment for his participation in the Exam Scam, thus violating his right to be free from double jeopardy.  He requested damages for these constitutional violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district court dismissed the claims against the Commonwealth and the Board, as well as the claims against the Board members in their official capacities.  The Board members in their individual capacities are thus the only remaining defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court withheld decision on the matter until after the Board issued its January 1995 decision.  Thereafter, on cross motions for summary judgment, the district court held that the Board had violated Clemente's procedural due process rights by failing to give him notice and a hearing before terminating his benefits.  The defendants did not dispute that Clemente had a constitutionally protected property interest in the benefits, and that, under state law, he was entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard before the Board terminated the benefits.  The district court rejected the defendants' argument that the Board's actions were \"random and unauthorized\" acts that could be cured by a post-deprivation hearing under Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 541 (1981), overruled in part on other grounds, Daniels v. Williams, 474 U.S. 327, 330 (1986), and rejected the defendants' claims of qualified immunity.  In addition, the court held that Clemente's substantive due process rights had not been violated, and it also rejected his double jeopardy claim, holding that the termination of payments was not punitive, and even if it were, that the Board's action was not unconstitutional because the criminal prosecution and the termination proceedings were brought by separate sovereigns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted Clemente's contention that the \"deprivation decision could have been made no faster in a proper fashion.\"   Therefore, the district court calculated damages from the due process violation to be the pension benefits Clemente would have received from the time the benefits were terminated until the January 1995 decision, as well as out-of-pocket medical expenses that would have been covered under the health insurance plan.  That amount was $104,064.85, plus interest.  However, the district court also determined that \"[t]his amount may be used to offset the restitution amount Clemente owes as a result of the defendants' January 4, 1995, decision.\"   Clemente has appealed both the award of the offset and the rejection of his double jeopardy claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clemente appeals the district court's holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause did not bar the termination of his benefits.  Even assuming arguendo that the Board's termination of Clemente's benefits constituted punishment,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> the doctrine of double jeopardy does not apply to suits brought by separate sovereigns.  Abbate v. United States, 359 U.S. 187, 194 (1959);  United States v. 40 Moon Hill Road, 884 F.2d 41, 43 (1st Cir.1989).  Clemente was convicted of a federal offense in federal court.  The Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar later action by the Commonwealth to terminate benefits and thereby recover sums it lost due to the offense, even if the termination were in part punitive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. The Offset</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clemente challenges the offset, arguing that it should be reversed because it was not timely pleaded<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> and because the Board's order did not establish a legally enforceable debt for the amount of restitution.  The defendants counter by characterizing the district court's judgment as a permanent injunction, warranted by the equities in the case, and argue that the district court did not abuse its equitable discretion in formulating such relief.  The defendants also argue that the offset was appropriate to prevent a windfall to Clemente.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Supreme Court said in Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 258-59 (1978):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>In order to further the purpose of &#167; 1983, the rules governing compensation for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights should be tailored to the interests protected by the particular right in question--just as the common-law rules of damages themselves were defined by the interests protected in the various branches of tort law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court was concerned about fashioning an award to the plaintiff that would \"redress,\" to use the language of &#167; 1983, his actual injuries.  The court's order was intended to permit \"judgment to be rendered that does justice in view of the one transaction as a whole.\"  Rothensies v. Electric Storage Battery Co., 329 U.S. 296, 299 (1946).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remedial order is to be read as a whole and provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The clerk is directed to enter judgment for the plaintiff directing defendants first to apply as an offset to the restitutionary award made against plaintiff by the defendants' decision of January 4, 1995, an amount equal to the [damages plaintiff suffered in terms of pension benefits and medical expenses].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order also establishes a mechanism that accommodates the fact that Clemente has appealed the Board's January 4, 1995 decision in state court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board's January 4, 1995 decision recites that such an offset would be \"far exceeded by the principle [sic] amount of restitution due.\"   Under the circumstances, it does not appear necessary for this court to calculate the precise offset in order to adjudicate the issues between the parties in this litigation.  Of course, if there is such a dispute, it may be resolved in light of the principles developed in this Memorandum, through the ordinary administrative process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By this mechanism, we understand that should the state court reject or revise the Board's decision, a corollary adjustment would be made in the amount, if any, recoverable under the federal order.  The issue here is whether such an order was within the power of the court and represented a proper exercise of its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clemente is correct that this is not a classic \"set-off,\" within the technical meaning of the term.  A \"set-off\" is a \" 'counter-claim demand which defendant holds against plaintiff, arising out of a transaction extrinsic of plaintiff's cause of action.' \"  United Structures of Am., Inc. v. G.R.G. Eng'g, S.E., 9 F.3d 996, 998 (1st Cir.1993) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1230 (5th ed.1979)).  In this case, however, the debts were not reciprocal, as is usually true in a set-off.  Clemente's damages ran only against the members of the Board in their individual capacities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> while the restitution award was due the MDC, an agency of the Commonwealth.  Thus, the mutuality of debt generally required to support a set-off was lacking.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  But Clemente's argument that it is not a set off<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> in the end proves nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite defendants' inappropriate characterization of the relief as injunctive relief, we believe the district court was exercising its equitable judgment in fashioning the remedy.  We start with the premise that \"[t]he measure of damages in section 1983 actions is a matter of federal common law.\"  Figueroa-Rodriguez v. Aquino, 863 F.2d 1037, 1045 (1st Cir.1988);  see also Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc. 396 U.S. 229, 240 (1969) (\"The rule of damages, whether drawn from federal or state sources, is a federal rule responsive to the need whenever a federal right is impaired.\").  We review the exercise of equitable jurisdiction under an abuse of discretion standard.  Ferrofluidics Corp. v.

Fed.R.Civ.P. 2.  Thus, Clemente's legal argument on set off does not cut back on the court's equitable remedial power.  One commentator has noted that \"[a]fter merger, a court having both law and equity powers may give the plaintiff any remedy justified by pleading and proof.\"   2 Dobbs, Law of Remedies &#167; 2.6(1), at 150 (2d ed.1993).  The ancient distinctions between law and equity, helpful in some contexts, see Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500 (1959), are less so here.  \"[W]ith the merger of law and equity it is difficult to see why equitable defenses should be limited to equitable suits anymore, and of course many are not so limited....\"  Byron v. Clay, 867 F.2d 1049, 1052 (7th Cir.1989) (Posner, J.).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  Courts also have articulated the broader principle \"that adjures a court to consider the third party effects of equitable relief and to shape that relief accordingly.\"  Id. at 1051.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fashioning a remedy under &#167; 1983, trial judges may consider the equities of the matter.  \"[T]he hallmark of equity is the ability to assess all relevant facts and circumstances and tailor appropriate relief on a case by case basis.\"  Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon, 889 F.2d 314, 321 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc) (whether to reinstate a public employee fired in violation of &#167; 1983 is within the discretion of trial court);  see also Walker v. Waltham Hous.  Auth., 44 F.3d 1042, 1048 (1st Cir.1995) (trial judge was \"unquestionably within her authority in holding that the equities did not warrant [reinstatement to public job]\").  \"The substantive scope of relief available is a matter of the equitable powers of the federal courts.  Accordingly, courts have exercised broad remedial power in civil rights actions.\"  Knecht v. Gillman, 488 F.2d 1136, 1140 (8th Cir.1973).  Whatever the limits of a federal court's equitable remedial power in an action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, we believe the \"restitution\" order here is well within that scope and was proper.  Restitution orders requiring criminals to restore the victim to the victim's original position are of venerable origin.  See Note, Victim Restitution in the Criminal Process;  A Procedural Analysis, 97 Harv.  L.Rev. 931, 933 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, due to the mechanisms implementing Eleventh Amendment guaranties, the damages were awarded against individual defendants, and the restitution was owed not to these defendants, but to a state agency.  See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.S. 21, 26-30 (1991).  However, we think the district court was entitled to consider the close relationship between the individual defendants--state officials--and the state.  In fact, defendants were exercising their responsibilities as state officials in the very activities that gave rise to this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the distinction between the individual defendants and the state agency, the district court could look to the underlying reality of the situation.  \"The essence of equity jurisdiction has been the power ... to mould each decree to the necessities of the particular case.\"  Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329 (1944).  This is an unusual case, with a fact pattern not likely to recur, and we think the district court was sensitive to the realities.  The alleged procedural due process violation and the basis for the assertion of the setoff arise from related questions as to what plaintiff is in fact due by way of benefits, questions arising from the statutory scheme the Commonwealth has created in Gen. L. ch. 30.  These are not unrelated parties or unrelated matters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Indeed, the order was entered against a backdrop in which the Board, after giving Clemente the hearing to which he was entitled, found that he was not entitled to benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clemente argues strenuously that reversing the offset will produce no windfall because there is no right of recoupment unless he wishes to have his pension rights reinstated under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 32, &#167; 15.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a>  The state courts will address the state law issues here on Clemente's appeal from the Board's order.  The district court order provides a mechanism for adjustment which, depending on the outcome of that appeal, should avoid the problem of overpayment to either side.  In any event, the state law issues, while informing the federal court's exercise of discretion, do not define the limits of that discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each side cites to us the Eighth Circuit decisions in Hankins v. Finnel, 964 F.2d 853 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1013 (1992) and Beeks v. Handley, 34 F.3d 658 (8th Cir.1994).  While neither Hankins nor Beeks is on point (and each raises issues extraneous to this case), we agree with the Eighth Circuit that &#167; 1983 relief must be consistent with the deterrence goal inherent in &#167; 1983.  An important purpose of &#167; 1983 is \"to serve as a deterrent against future constitutional deprivations.\"  Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 651 (1980).  Along with the Beeks court we conclude that \"victim restitution does not defeat &#167; 1983's deterrence goal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Beeks, 34 F.3d at 661;  see also Doe v. Morgenthau, 871 F.Supp. 605, 611 (S.D.N.Y.1994) (\"Any claim ... on behalf of plaintiff's victims would be an offset to plaintiff's claims against the People and could be asserted as of right.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, the deterrence argument must also accommodate \"the factual permutations and the equitable considerations they raise\" on a case by case basis.  McKennon v. Nashville Banner Pub. Co., 115 S.Ct. 879, 886 (1995).  While McKennon was an ADEA action, the related deterrence argument there did not trump a damages remedy which fairly accounts for a plaintiff's own wrongdoing.  McKennon holds that where after-acquired evidence demonstrates an employer would have terminated plaintiff anyway, even though the employer had a discriminatory motive, the plaintiff, as a general rule, is not entitled to front pay or reinstatement, nor to back-pay damages extending beyond the time the employer learned about the employee wrongdoing that would have led to legitimate discharge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Id.

However, in its January 1995 decision, the Board stated that \"[Clemente] is ineligible for any retirement allowance under the provisions of sections 1-28, regardless of whether he ever makes restitution or whether the Board recovers misappropriated funds from the other MDC co-conspirators.\"   Because we affirm summary judgment on the double jeopardy claim on the separate sovereign theory, we need not decide whether the termination was punitive in nature</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Defendants first raised the issue in pleadings filed after the summary judgment motion.

Clemente's disability retirement and group insurance benefits because of his conviction of a crime four years earlier.  Clemente had been federally prosecuted and convicted for his involvement in the theft and sale of police promotional exams, a scheme popularly known as the \"Exam Scam.\"  See generally United States v. Doherty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518089\"><a href=\"/opinion/518089/united-states-v-thomas-k-doherty-united-states-of-america-v-nelson-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span> (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></span> (1989).  Clemente's crime, the Board reasoned, involved the funds or property of a state agency and so justified the termination of Clemente's benefits under Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 32, &#167; 15(1), (3).  Clemente did not receive prior notice of the impending termination of benefits;  nor was he given an opportunity to be heard.  Four years after the termination, after Clemente had appealed the decision through the state administrative process, the Board finally held a hearing.  It then determined that Clemente was not entitled to receive the benefits the Board had earlier stopped paying.  The Board also determined that Clemente owed an agency of the Commonwealth, the Metropolitan District Commission (\"MDC\"), sums in restitution for his crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interim, Clemente had filed this action alleging procedural and substantive due process violations.  The district court held that the Board's initial termination of Clemente's benefits violated Clemente's constitutional right to procedural due process and that the defendant Board members were individually liable.  The court determined that Clemente's federal damages were the payments he would have received up to the time of an adequate hearing and then \"offset\" the damages by the restitutionary amount the Board had determined Clemente owed to the MDC on account of his crimes, an amount apparently greater than the damages suffered.  Clemente appeals from the judgment, complaining primarily of the offset.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clemente worked as a police officer with the MDC until May 28, 1983, when the Board granted him an accidental disability retirement due to his hypertension, which prevented him from working.  Clemente thereafter received a monthly allowance from the State Retirement System as well as group medical insurance benefits for himself and his wife.  In November 1986, Clemente pleaded guilty to a federal racketeering charge.  He had participated in a scheme to defraud the Commonwealth by stealing police promotional exams, giving or selling them to others, and altering scores.  In 1988, the Board requested an opinion from the State Attorney General as to the effect of the conviction on Clemente's entitlement to pension benefits.  The Attorney General responded in June 1990, advising the Board that the Exam Scam scheme, to the extent that it actually succeeded, was a crime that involved MDC funds or property within the meaning of Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 32, &#167; 15.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1990, without giving Clemente notice that such an action was contemplated, the Board voted to terminate his benefits based upon its determination that his racketeering conviction was for an offense which involved the funds or property of the MDC. The Board then notified Clemente of its action and ceased paying benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clemente appealed to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board, which, in September 1992, remanded the matter to the Board and directed the Board to hold a hearing if Clemente so requested.  In 1994, the Board finally notified Clemente of its intent to initiate misappropriation charges and then held a hearing upon his request.  On January 4, 1995, the Board issued a decision finding that Clemente had misappropriated MDC funds and owed restitution to the MDC in the amount of $239,146 plus interest and ordered forfeited all his rights to his retirement allowance and accumulated deductions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, while the state administrative action was pending but before the Board had given him a hearing, Clemente filed this federal action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 against the Commonwealth, the Board, and the members who served on the Board when Clemente's benefits were terminated in 1990.  Clemente claimed that the defendants terminated his disability retirement allowance and medical benefits without notice or a hearing, thus violating his rights to both substantive and procedural due process.  He also claimed that the termination constituted further punishment for his participation in the Exam Scam, thus violating his right to be free from double jeopardy.  He requested damages for these constitutional violations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district court dismissed the claims against the Commonwealth and the Board, as well as the claims against the Board members in their official capacities.  The Board members in their individual capacities are thus the only remaining defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court withheld decision on the matter until after the Board issued its January 1995 decision.  Thereafter, on cross motions for summary judgment, the district court held that the Board had violated Clemente's procedural due process rights by failing to give him notice and a hearing before terminating his benefits.  The defendants did not dispute that Clemente had a constitutionally protected property interest in the benefits, and that, under state law, he was entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard before the Board terminated the benefits.  The district court rejected the defendants' argument that the Board's actions were \"random and unauthorized\" acts that could be cured by a post-deprivation hearing under Parratt v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110478\"><a href=\"/opinion/110478/parratt-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span>, 541 (1981), overruled in part on other grounds, Daniels v.

In addition, the court held that Clemente's substantive due process rights had not been violated, and it also rejected his double jeopardy claim, holding that the termination of payments was not punitive, and even if it were, that the Board's action was not unconstitutional because the criminal prosecution and the termination proceedings were brought by separate sovereigns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted Clemente's contention that the \"deprivation decision could have been made no faster in a proper fashion.\"   Therefore, the district court calculated damages from the due process violation to be the pension benefits Clemente would have received from the time the benefits were terminated until the January 1995 decision, as well as out-of-pocket medical expenses that would have been covered under the health insurance plan.

Whatever the limits of a federal court's equitable remedial power in an action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, we believe the \"restitution\" order here is well within that scope and was proper.  Restitution orders requiring criminals to restore the victim to the victim's original position are of venerable origin.

This is an unusual case, with a fact pattern not likely to recur, and we think the district court was sensitive to the realities.  The alleged procedural due process violation and the basis for the assertion of the setoff arise from related questions as to what plaintiff is in fact due by way of benefits, questions arising from the statutory scheme the Commonwealth has created in Gen. L. ch. 30.  These are not unrelated parties or unrelated matters.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a>  Indeed, the order was entered against a backdrop in which the Board, after giving Clemente the hearing to which he was entitled, found that he was not entitled to benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clemente argues strenuously that reversing the offset will produce no windfall because there is no right of recoupment unless he wishes to have his pension rights reinstated under Mass.

While neither Hankins nor Beeks is on point (and each raises issues extraneous to this case), we agree with the Eighth Circuit that &#167; 1983 relief must be consistent with the deterrence goal inherent in &#167; 1983.

McKennon holds that where after-acquired evidence demonstrates an employer would have terminated plaintiff anyway, even though the employer had a discriminatory motive, the plaintiff, as a general rule, is not entitled to front pay or reinstatement, nor to back-pay damages extending beyond the time the employer learned about the employee wrongdoing that would have led to legitimate discharge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Id.

In United Structures, 9 F.3d at 999, then-Chief Judge Breyer pointed out the relevance of the doctrine of recoupment to cases such as Clemente's:</p>\n        <p>Recoupment ... is \"in the nature of a defense\" and is intended to \"permit ... judgment to be rendered that does justice in view of the one transaction as a whole.\"</p>\n        <p>Id. (quoting Rothensies, 329 U.S. at 299).   The court in United Structures further commented that the plaintiff \"has, in a sense, no right to funds subject to recoupment.\"  Id. at 998.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Upholding in Byron the dismissal of a &#167; 1983 action brought by a former government employee who had been discharged for political reasons and who sought reinstatement to a \"ghost job\" (a job for which no work was required but for which a salary was paid), Judge Posner noted:  \"It is enough to observe that a highwayman who decided to sue his partner for common law damages as well as for an equitable accounting for profits would surely have gotten no further with his 'legal' claim than with his 'equitable' one.\"  Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> As a result, we express no views on whether such a restitutionary order in favor of a truly independent third party, or based on unrelated transactions, could be used to set off a judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> This may or may not be a correct reading of state law.  For example, Mass.  Gen. L. ch. 32, &#167; 15(1) provides that \"[i]f the Board after the hearing finds the charges [of misappropriation] to be true, such member shall forfeit all rights....\"  Id.

That right is qualified, however, by G.L. c. 32 &#167; 15(3), which provides that, upon conviction of an offense involving misappropriation of any funds of the governmental unit in which the person was employed, such return is conditioned upon the making of full restitution of the funds misappropriated.\"), rev. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">617</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></span> (Mass.1993)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn14\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14_ref\">14</a>\n        <p> Indeed, Clemente was awarded attorney's fees, not subject to the offset.  Attorney's fee awards are themselves a deterrent.  Congress must have believed so when, in a related area of law, it enacted the 1991 Civil Rights Act, which provides for recovery of attorney's fees in mixed motive cases even when actual damages are unavailable.  42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g)(2)(B)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn15\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15_ref\">15</a>\n        <p> It is not difficult to imagine a situation where, under McKennon, an illegally discharged employee might win a civil rights suit, yet still walk away empty-handed, as Clemente does in this case.  For instance, if the employer discovers the after-acquired evidence which would justify termination on the same day as the illegal discharge, or shortly afterwards, plaintiff's back-pay damages would be nonexistent or minimal</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
