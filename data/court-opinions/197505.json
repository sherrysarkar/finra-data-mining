We\r\n\naffirm the district court judgment in all respects.\r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                           BACKGROUND1\r                                     BACKGROUND\r                                               \r\n\n          WorldCom,  a  corporation  with its principal  place of\r\n\nbusiness  in Jackson,  Mississippi,  and  an  office  in  Revere,\r\n\nMassachusetts,  provides   subscribers  with   specialized  long-\r\n\ndistance services, including toll-free \"800\"  numbers.2  Pursuant\r\n\nto industry standards,  toll-free \"800\" numbers  are stored in  a\r\n\ncentral  database  known  as the  800  Service  Management System\r\n\n(\"SMS/800\").   All \"800\"  numbers are  reserved  and assigned  to\r\n\nsubscribers by so-called Responsible  Organizations (\"RESP ORGs\")\r\n\nthrough SMS/800.  \r\n\n          In  March  1994,  Play  Time,  a   Massachusetts-based,\r\n\nfamily-owned  corporation  engaged in  selling art  supplies, was\r\n\nendeavoring to expand into nationwide telephonic networking aimed\r\n\nat the commercial real estate leasing market.  Michael Levosky, a\r\n\nPlay Time  shareholder and  co-manager,  envisioned a  nationwide\r\n\nreferral service through  which potential customers could  call a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1\"We recite the  facts as the jury and  district court could\r\nhave found them.\"  Roche v.  Royal Bank of Canada, 109 F.3d  820,\r                                                           \r\n821 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\n\n     2At the time of the  relevant events, its corporate name was\r\nLDDS Metromedia Communications, Inc.  \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\ntoll-free  \"800\" number and  enter information into  an automated\r\n\ncall router which  would link the caller to a  real estate office\r\n\nnear the place the caller wanted to lease commercial real estate.\r\n\nPlay Time would generate income from the fees charged real estate\r\n\nbrokers for  their advertising and  usage of the  toll-free \"800\"\r\n\nnumber.\r\n\n          To that  end, Play  Time set out  to obtain  a suitable\r\n\nvanity  number,  one  whose alphabetical  counterpart  conveyed a\r\n\nbusiness message  readily identified  and remembered  by targeted\r\n\ncustomers.   Levosky  decided  to  obtain 1-800-\"367-5327\"  (\"the\r\n\nNumber\"),  which  would  transpose  as \"FOR-LEAS[E].\"    WorldCom\r\n\nadvised  Levosky that  the Number,  though not  then in  use, was\r\n\nexpected to become available a few weeks later, on or about April\r\n\n20, 1994.3\r\n\n          Levosky   called   the  WorldCom   office   in  Revere,\r\n\nMassachusetts, which  handled other  telephone business  for Play\r\n\nTime, and  spoke with the  \"800\" coordinator, Martha  Burton, who\r\n\nconfirmed  that the Number  would become available  in mid-April.\r\n\nBurton assured Levosky  that she would obtain  the Number through\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3The SMS/800 system records the status of all \"800\" numbers.\r\nNormally, \"800\"  numbers fall into  one of five  main categories:\r\n\"assigned,\" \"working,\"  \"spare,\" \"disconnect,\"  or \"unavailable.\"\r\nAfter a subscriber  advises that it no longer  needs a particular\r\n\"800\" number, the number is  allowed to age for approximately six\r\nmonths  before reverting  to  \"spare\" status.    Only numbers  in\r\n\"spare\"  status are immediately available to the next subscriber.\r\nA number in \"spare\" status is not assigned to any particular RESP\r\nORG, but  can be assigned to a subscriber  by any RESP ORG simply\r\nby  reserving it  with SMS/800.   Once an  \"800\" number  has been\r\nassigned to a particular RESP ORG, however, no other RESP ORG can\r\ncontrol its status. \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nSMS/800  and assign  it to  Play  Time once  it attained  \"spare\"\r\n\nstatus.\r\n\n          On  April 20, 1994, one  week after WorldCom became the\r\n\nRESP ORG for the Number, and the day  the Number was to revert to\r\n\n\"spare\" status, Levosky reminded WorldCom to assign the Number to\r\n\nPlay  Time.4  Notwithstanding  that WorldCom had  been designated\r\n\nthe RESP ORG for the Number, however, it did not do so.   Levosky\r\n\ncalled WorldCom frequently between April  20 and May 10, 1994, to\r\n\nascertain  why the Number had not yet been assigned to Play Time,\r\n\nonly to be told essentially that WorldCom was checking into it.\r\n\n          On  May  11,  1994, Levosky  called  Joseph  Shannon, a\r\n\nsenior account executive in WorldCom's Revere office, who assured\r\n\nLevosky that the  Number could be assigned to Play  Time once the\r\n\nappropriate paperwork  had  been  completed.    Levosky  promptly\r\n\nexecuted the required documents and returned  them to Shannon the\r\n\nsame day; Shannon faxed  them to the WorldCom RESP ORG  office in\r\n\nSan Antonio on May 12. \r\n\n          Although  the WorldCom fax machine in the Revere office\r\n\nprinted a  receipt reflecting that  the fax had been  received in\r\n\nSan Antonio on May 12, when Shannon called the San Antonio office\r\n\non  May 13  he was  informed that  the documents  had never  been\r\n\nreceived.  Once again Shannon  faxed the documents.  Although the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Any  RESP  ORG  may  reserve  a number  in  \"spare\"  status\r\ndirectly through SMS/800.  The  number is then \"reported to\" that\r\nRESP ORG, in  \"reserve\" status.   At all times  relevant to  this\r\nappeal,  a number  could remain  in reserve status  for up  to 60\r\ndays.   Thereafter, it  automatically reverted to  \"spare\" status\r\nunless it had achieved \"assigned\" or \"working\" status.  \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nsecond set of documents was received in San Antonio on May 13, as\r\n\nconfirmed by telephone, still the Number was not assigned to Play\r\n\nTime.    Shannon was  told  the delay  was  due to  difficulty in\r\n\ngetting  the  Number released  from SMS/800,  notwithstanding the\r\n\nfact that WorldCom  was already the RESP ORG for the Number.  But\r                                                                           \r\n\nsee supra note 3.\r                   \r\n\n          Meanwhile,  one Michael  Eisemann had asked  a WorldCom\r\n\noffice  in Indiana  to  obtain  the Number  for  his real  estate\r\n\nbusiness.   Eisemann intended to  use the Number in  a nationwide\r\n\nreferral system  similar to that  envisioned by Levosky.   On May\r\n\n20, 1994,  approximately two months  after Levosky  first made  a\r\n\nverbal request for the Number and nine days after Levosky's first\r\n\nwritten request,  Eisemann submitted  the order  to the  WorldCom\r\n\noffice  in Indiana,  with  the  required  paperwork.    Levosky's\r\n\nearlier requests notwithstanding, WorldCom assigned the Number to\r\n\nEisemann, because its Revere office had never entered Play Time's\r\n\nrequest into SMS/800. \r\n\n          Unaware that Eisemann had obtained  the Number, Levosky\r\n\ncontinued to inquire into its  status.  Although Levosky was told\r\n\nthere  had been  some  delay due  to paperwork  problems, Shannon\r\n\nadvised him  that the problems  had been resolved and  the Number\r\n\nwould soon  be assigned to Play Time.   On May 26, Levosky dialed\r\n\nthe  Number to  determine whether  it would  ring at  Play Time's\r\n\noffice.   The  call  was answered  instead by  an  employee in  a\r\n\nDetroit,  Michigan,   maintenance  office.     Whereupon  Levosky\r\n\ncontacted WorldCom,  only to  be informed that  there had  been a\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\ncomputer \"glitch.\"\r\n\n          Although WorldCom switched  the Number to Play  Time on\r\n\nMay  27,  by May  31 it  was  once again  ringing at  the Detroit\r\n\nmaintenance office.  The Number changed hands between Levosky and\r\n\nEisemann four  more times between  May 31 and June  2, ultimately\r\n\nremaining with  Eisemann.   On June 2,  Shannon tracked  down the\r\n\nIndiana sales representative responsible for assigning the Number\r\n\nto Eisemann, and learned for the first time that Eisemann too had\r\n\nrequested the  Number.   After  Shannon informed  Levosky of  the\r\n\nproblem,   Levosky  complained   that  WorldCom   originally  had\r\n\nretrieved the Number  from SMS/800 at his request,  more than two\r\n\nmonths earlier.   Levosky then asked  WorldCom to disconnect  the\r\n\nNumber pending an investigation.\r\n\n          Shannon and  his supervisor,  Charles Hurd,  approached\r\n\nsenior WorldCom management in the Revere  office, urging that the\r\n\nNumber be  returned to Play  Time.  Hurd informed  Brady Buckley,\r\n\nVice President of  sales for the eastern region,  that the Number\r\n\nhad been taken from Play Time.  Buckley asked Hurd how much money\r\n\nthe  Number could be  expected to  produce.   Hurd was  unable to\r\n\nanswer the  question.  Buckley  finally told Hurd:   \"F--- it[;]\"\r\n\n\"leave it alone.\"\r\n\n          Upon  learning that  the Revere  office  was unable  or\r\n\nunwilling  to  assist  him  further,  Levosky  contacted  Deborah\r\n\nSurrette, WorldCom Vice President for the Northeast region.  When\r\n\nLevosky explained why  the Number was so important  to Play Time,\r\n\nSurrette promised to investigate the  matter and get back to him.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nSurrette asked  Kelle Reeves,  director of customer  provisioning\r\n\nand  RESP ORG,  to  determine whether  WorldCom  policy had  been\r\n\nfollowed in  regard to the  Number.  After speaking  with several\r\n\npeople,  but  without  attempting either  to  contact  the Revere\r\n\noffice  or to  ascertain which  customer had first  requested the\r                                                                       \r\n\nNumber, Reeves simply  concluded that WorldCom had  complied with\r\n\nindustry  guidelines requiring \"800\" numbers to be allocated on a\r\n\n\"first-come, first-served\"  basis, as Eisemann's request had been\r\n\nthe first to be entered into SMS/800.5\r\n\n          Levosky continued to urge WorldCom to return the Number\r\n\nto Play  Time, but was  told that industry  guidelines prohibited\r\n\nits reassignment.    See  supra note  5.    Levosky  nevertheless\r                                         \r\n\nmaintained  that Play  Time had  been  the first  to request  the\r\n\nNumber.   WorldCom  then  altered  course,  explaining  that  its\r\n\nrelationship  with  Levosky  was   not  controlled  by   industry\r                                                \r\n\nguidelines, which govern only the relationship between a RESP ORG\r\n\nand SMS/800.\r\n\n          At that point, WorldCom wrongly  represented to Levosky\r\n\nthat the problem had been caused by AT&amp;T.  According to WorldCom,\r\n\nAT&amp;T had  been the RESP ORG for the Number  on the date Play Time\r\n\nrequested  it,  but had  released  the Number  to  \"spare\" status\r\n\nrather than assigning it to  WorldCom.  To the contrary, however,\r\n\nAT&amp;T was never the RESP ORG  for the Number after 1993.   Rather,\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5Industry guidelines  provide  that:  \"Specific  800  Number\r\nrequests  are honored  based on  availability,  on a  first-come,\r\nfirst-served  basis, at  the  time  the  reservation  request  is\r\ninitiated by a  RESP ORG into SMS/800.\"   Industry Guidelines for\r\n800 Number Administration, 2.3.1 (Issue 3.0, December 1, 1993)\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nas we  have noted, WorldCom  itself had been the  designated RESP\r\n\nORG since April 13, 1994.\r\n\n          Finally, WorldCom informed  Levosky that the  documents\r\n\nhe had submitted  through Shannon, see supra  p. 4, had  not been\r                                                      \r\n\nreceived  by its  San Antonio  office  until after  the May  20th\r\n\nrequest from Eisemann,  even though  a WorldCom  employee in  San\r\n\nAntonio had confirmed receipt of the Levosky paperwork on May 13.\r\n\nPlay  Time brought  suit against  WorldCom on  November 9,  1994,\r\n\ndemanding  damages  and  specific  performance.    Shortly  after\r\n\nEisemann  was named  an indispensable  party in  relation to  the\r\n\nspecific performance  claim     because he  still controlled  the\r\n\nNumber    he  changed long-distance carriers to  prevent WorldCom\r\n\nfrom returning the Number to Play Time.\r\n\n          Play Time  then offered  Eisemann  an immediate  $5,000\r\n\nnon-refundable deposit and an additional $45,000 following trial,\r\n\nin  return for  the Number.    At the  same time,  it  offered to\r\n\ndismiss its  action against Eisemann  if he would testify  to the\r\n\nvalue of  the Number.   Eisemann  countered with  a demand for  a\r\n\n$10,000  non-refundable deposit and  $40,000 after trial.   Their\r\n\nnegotiations  ultimately fell through because Play Time could not\r\n\ncome up with the additional $5,000 non-refundable deposit.\r\n\n          Eisemann  nevertheless  testified  at  trial  that  the\r\n\nNumber did have inherent value, explaining that \"people would buy\r\n\nthe [vanity]  number for [its]  potential value.\"  He  produced a\r\n\npamphlet he had  developed for marketing the Number,  touting the\r\n\nimportance of  vanity  numbers in  reaching potential  customers.\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nAlthough Eisemann  acknowledged that  he was  motivated to  enter\r\n\ninto an agreement  with Levosky in part because he  wanted to get\r\n\nLevosky \"out of  his hair,\" he  consistently maintained that  the\r\n\nNumber had inherent value.\r\n\n          The jury returned verdicts for Play Time on all counts,\r\n\nawarding $50,000 in damages on each count, representing the value\r\n\nof  the  Number under  a  \"willing-transferor-willing-transferee\"\r\n\nstandard.   The  total  award was  limited  to $50,000,  however,\r\n\nbecause  the jury  determined that recovery  under more  than one\r\n\ncount would be redundant. \r\n\n          At  a later  hearing, the  presiding  judge found  that\r\n\nWorldCom had violated Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A,  11, which affords\r\n\ncivil  relief from unfair  or deceptive business  practices.  The\r\n\ncourt  determined WorldCom's  conduct both unfair  and deceptive,\r\n\nand  held  that  it had  occurred  \"primarily  and substantially\"\r\n\nwithin Massachusetts.  Accordingly, the court trebled the $50,000\r\n\ndamages award made by the jury, see Mass. Gen.

It maintains that \"800\" numbers\r\n\nare without  inherent value as  a matter  of law, since  it would\r\n\nviolate  industry guidelines and public policy to allow telephone\r\n\nnumbers to be bought and sold on the open market.  \r\n\n          Throughout the trial, Play Time made it very clear that\r\n\nit was demanding the value of the Number.  Early on, the district\r\n\ncourt set  itself  to the  task  of articulating  an  appropriate\r\n\nmeasure of damages.  WorldCom voiced no objection to the district\r\n\ncourt's proposed  articulation of  the measure  of damages  until\r\n\nafter the close of the evidence.  At that time, its trial counsel\r\n\noffered two cursory observations. \r\n\n          First, WorldCom stated  that the measure of  damages on\r\n\nthe  negligence  claim  should  be  different  from that  on  the\r\n\ncontract claim.   Its second observation appears in the following\r\n\nexchange: \r\n\n          WorldCom:  Your Honor, just for the record, I\r                                                                 \r\n          haven't  made  any comments  on  the willing-\r                                                                 \r\n          assignor-willing-assignee  theory.

What  amount of money, if any,  do you\r\n          find to be fair  and reasonable compensation,\r\n          of each  of the  following types,  for .  . .\r\n          breach . . . of contract?

If the reality is  that in\r\n          human experience a  property interest exactly\r\n          like  that transferred in  this case  has not\r\n          been   transferred    in   an    arm's-length\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n          transaction  between  real people,  you  must\r\n          imagine a  transaction not  exactly like  any\r\n          transaction described in  the evidence before\r\n          you.\r\n\n               These hypothetical persons,  the willing\r\n          transferor  and  willing  transferee,  always\r\n          come to an  agreement.  They never  end their\r\n          negotiations in failure.  They always  arrive\r\n          at a value they both agree upon.\r\n\n               The  aim of  factfinding  by using  this\r\n          willing-transferor-willing-transferee\r\n          standard is to help you evaluate the parties'\r\n          evidence, and their  arguments about evidence\r\n          and  about formulas  and  figures, and  about\r\n          other factors in evidence  that bear upon the\r\n          issue  of  value.     You  are  to   do  your\r\n          evaluation in  the way  you find  the willing\r\n          transferor  and   willing  transferee   would\r\n          evaluate the same factors and arguments.\r\n\n               To  these  persons   different  formulas\r\n          suggested   by  opposing   parties  are   not\r\n          binding.  They  are only tools.   The willing\r\n          transferor  and  willing  transferee  do  not\r\n          overlook relevant evidence.  They weigh every\r\n          relevant factor.   They are not experts,  but\r\n          they  are attentive to expert advice.  But in\r\n          the  end they make  a pragmatic decision that\r\n          enables  them to come to a common value after\r\n          evaluating all of the  evidence and arguments\r\n          before them.\r\n\n          After the jury charge had been delivered, the presiding\r\n\njudge invited  objections to the  charge and the  special verdict\r\n\nform.  At that point, WorldCom simply registered its objection to\r\n\nthe  \"instruction  on the  measure  of damages\"  relating  to the\r\n\n\"willing-transferor-willing-transferee\" standard.   The  district\r\n\ncourt overruled the objection. \r\n\n          Objections to jury instructions are governed by Fed. R.\r\n\nCiv. P. 51, which provides in relevant part that \"[n]o  party may\r\n\nassign as error  the giving or the failure to give an instruction\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nunless  that party  objects thereto  before the  jury retires  to\r\n\nconsider its verdict,  stating distinctly the matter  objected to\r                                                                           \r\n\nand the grounds of the objection.\"   Fed.

In  addition, Eisemann and  Levosky testified  to their\r\n\nefforts to  close the  deal whereby Levosky  was to  acquire from\r\n\nEisemann the right to use the Number at the agreed $50,000 price.\r\n\nAlthough  their deal could not be consummated,  it was not due to\r\n\ntheir inability to  agree on value:  Levosky  offered $50,000 for\r\n\nthe  Number;  Eisemann  was amenable  to  accepting  $50,000, but\r\n\nwanted  a  larger  downpayment,  which Play  Time  was  unable to\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nmanage.\r\n\n          WorldCom  focuses on an  admission by Eisemann  that he\r\n\nwas motivated, in  part, to release  his rights to the  Number in\r\n\norder to  get Levosky, who had named him  as a party defendant in\r\n\nthe lawsuit, \"out of his hair.\"  WorldCom relies also on a letter\r\n\nfrom Play Time's counsel to Eisemann,  which provided in relevant\r\n\npart: \r\n\n          My client, Play-Time, offers to enter into an\r\n          option agreement  whereby Play-Time  pays you\r\n          (or the  entity that controls the  Number, if\r\n          different from you), $5000.00 for the  option\r\n          to purchase the right to use the Number for a\r\n          total  of $50,000.00  (i.e., $45,000.00  plus\r\n          the  $5000.00 down  payment).

WorldCom  argues that  this letter  makes it\r\n\nclear  that  at least  a portion  of the  $50,000 agreed  upon by\r\n\nEisemann  and  Levosky  represented  the  value  of  Play  Time's\r\n\nagreement to drop its lawsuit against Eisemann.\r\n\n          Although  WorldCom  proposes   an  entirely  reasonable\r\n\ninterpretation,  another  is  that  the  letter  memorializes two\r\n\ndistinct  offers:  the  first  to  pay a  total  of  $50,000  for\r\n\nEisemann's rights  in the Number;  the second to drop  the claims\r\n\nagainst Eisemann in exchange for Eisemann's trial testimony as to\r\n\nthe value of the Number.   Thus, the WorldCom contention that the\r\n\n$50,000 figure had  not been based  entirely on the value  of the\r\n\nNumber  did  not  preclude  a  reasonable  jury  finding  to  the\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\ncontrary.  Accordingly, we conclude  that the evidence on damages\r\n\nwas  adequate  to  withstand  the  WorldCom  motion  for  summary\r\n\njudgment,  and  that the  district  court committed  no  error in\r\n\nsubmitting the case to the jury.13\r\n\n3.

WorldCom contends that  any unfair\r\n\naction in this  case did not occur  \"primarily and substantially\"\r\n\nwithin Massachusetts.\r\n\n          The  trial court findings  on the \"nature,  extent, and\r\n\nplace  of performance\"  of WorldCom's  actions  are reviewed  for\r\n\nclear error  only.

The  court also\r             \r\n\nrelied  on the testimony  of Charles Hurd,  Shannon's supervisor,\r\n\nwho  expressed the view  that WorldCom management  had mistreated\r\n\nPlay Time.  Finally, the court identified the off-color remark by\r\n\nBrady  Buckley, see  supra p.  6, as  \"perhaps the  most dramatic\r                                    \r\n\ndemonstration of [WorldCom]'s thumb-their-nose attitude.\"  As the\r\n\ndistrict  court determined, all these actions took place entirely\r\n\nwithin Massachusetts.  The district  court further found that the\r\n\ninvestigation  conducted  by Deborah  Surrette  and  Kelle Reeves\r\n\namounted  to  mere  \"window  dressing,\"  thereby   enhancing  the\r\n\ndeceptiveness and unfairness to Play Time. \r\n\n          WorldCom  mounts no serious challenge to these district\r\n\ncourt findings.

Although we agree  with the district court,\r\n\nother weightier  factors cut against  WorldCom as well.   All the\r\n\nunfair or  deceptive statements  made by  WorldCom's agents  were\r\n\nvisited  upon Play  Time in  Massachusetts.   It  was there  that\r\n\nLevosky dealt with Joseph Shannon; learned that WorldCom's Revere\r\n\noffice would not  try to retain the Number for  Play Time because\r\n\nBuckley  believed any  potential  revenues were  inconsequential;\r\n\nlearned the  results of Surrette's superficial investigation; and\r\n\nwas provided  with  the numerous  pretexts  by WorldCom  for  not\r\n\nobtaining the Number for Play Time.\r\n\n          WorldCom, on the other hand, misplaces primary reliance\r\n\non  the location  of the  WorldCom agents  who made  the ultimate\r\n\nadverse decision  (Surrette and Reeves  in New  Jersey), and  the\r\n\nWorldCom sales  office (Indiana)  which obtained  the Number  for\r\n\nEisemann.  But the district court did not find the actions of the\r                                                   \r\n\nIndiana  sales agent  part  and parcel  of  WorldCom's unfair  or\r\n\ndeceptive  conduct.15   Moreover,  as  we have  noted,  the first\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     15Similarly, WorldCom's  Indiana agent  would not have  been\r\nable   to  assign   the  Number   to   Eisemann  had   WorldCom's\r\nMassachusetts  employees followed  through on  the commitment  to\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\nBushkin factor  is the least  weighty.  Finally, the  location of\r                 \r\n\nSurrette and  Reeves is  insufficient to  overcome the  competing\r\n\nevidence which must be weighed under the other Bushkin factors   \r                                                                \r\n\nincluding  Levosky's receipt of  the results of  the Surrette and\r\n\nReeves \"investigation\" in Massachusetts    all of which indicates\r\n\nthat the unfair and  deceptive behavior took place  primarily and\r\n\nsubstantially within  Massachusetts.   Thus,  WorldCom failed  to\r\n\ncarry  its burden of  proving that the Chapter  93A claim was not\r\n\nactionable. \r\n\n                               III\r                                         III\r\n\n                            CONCLUSION\r                                      CONCLUSION\r                                                \r\n\n          As  we conclude that all contentions raised by WorldCom\r\n\non appeal were waived or  meritless, the district court  judgment\r\n\nis affirmed.

Michael Levosky, a Play Time shareholder and co-manager, envisioned a nationwide referral service through which potential customers could call a toll-free \"800\" number and enter information into an automated call router which would link the caller to a real estate office near the place the caller wanted to lease commercial real estate.  Play Time would generate income from the fees charged real estate brokers for their advertising and usage of the toll-free \"800\" number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To that end, Play Time set out to obtain a suitable vanity number, one whose alphabetical counterpart conveyed a business message readily identified and remembered by targeted customers.  Levosky decided to obtain 1-800-\"367-5327\" (\"the Number\"), which would transpose as \"FOR-LEAS[E].\"  WorldCom advised Levosky that the Number, though not then in use, was expected to become available a few weeks later, on or about April 20, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Levosky called the WorldCom office in Revere, Massachusetts, which handled other telephone business for Play Time, and spoke with the \"800\" coordinator, Martha Burton, who confirmed that the Number would become available in mid-April.  Burton assured Levosky that she would obtain the Number through SMS/800 and assign it to Play Time once it attained \"spare\" status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 20, 1994, one week after WorldCom became the RESP ORG for the Number, and the day the Number was to revert to \"spare\" status, Levosky reminded WorldCom to assign the Number to Play Time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Notwithstanding that WorldCom had been designated the RESP ORG for the Number, however, it did not do so.  Levosky called WorldCom frequently between April 20 and May 10, 1994, to ascertain why the Number had not yet been assigned to Play Time, only to be told essentially that WorldCom was checking into it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 1994, Levosky called Joseph Shannon, a senior account executive in WorldCom's Revere office, who assured Levosky that the Number could be assigned to Play Time once the appropriate paperwork had been completed.  Levosky promptly executed the required documents and returned them to Shannon the same day;  Shannon faxed them to the WorldCom RESP ORG office in San Antonio on May 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the WorldCom fax machine in the Revere office printed a receipt reflecting that the fax had been received in San Antonio on May 12, when Shannon called the San Antonio office on May 13 he was informed that the documents had never been received.  Once again Shannon faxed the documents.  Although the second set of documents was received in San Antonio on May 13, as confirmed by telephone, still the Number was not assigned to Play Time.  Shannon was told the delay was due to difficulty in getting the Number released from SMS/800, notwithstanding the fact that WorldCom was already the RESP ORG for the Number.  But see supra note 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, one Michael Eisemann had asked a WorldCom office in Indiana to obtain the Number for his real estate business.  Eisemann intended to use the Number in a nationwide referral system similar to that envisioned by Levosky.  On May 20, 1994, approximately two months after Levosky first made a verbal request for the Number and nine days after Levosky's first written request, Eisemann submitted the order to the WorldCom office in Indiana, with the required paperwork.  Levosky's earlier requests notwithstanding, WorldCom assigned the Number to Eisemann, because its Revere office had never entered Play Time's request into SMS/800.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unaware that Eisemann had obtained the Number, Levosky continued to inquire into its status.  Although Levosky was told there had been some delay due to paperwork problems, Shannon advised him that the problems had been resolved and the Number would soon be assigned to Play Time.  On May 26, Levosky dialed the Number to determine whether it would ring at Play Time's office.  The call was answered instead by an employee in a Detroit, Michigan, maintenance office.  Whereupon Levosky contacted WorldCom, only to be informed that there had been a computer \"glitch.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although WorldCom switched the Number to Play Time on May 27, by May 31 it was once again ringing at the Detroit maintenance office.  The Number changed hands between Levosky and Eisemann four more times between May 31 and June 2, ultimately remaining with Eisemann.  On June 2, Shannon tracked down the Indiana sales representative responsible for assigning the Number to Eisemann, and learned for the first time that Eisemann too had requested the Number.  After Shannon informed Levosky of the problem, Levosky complained that WorldCom originally had retrieved the Number from SMS/800 at his request, more than two months earlier.  Levosky then asked WorldCom to disconnect the Number pending an investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shannon and his supervisor, Charles Hurd, approached senior WorldCom management in the Revere office, urging that the Number be returned to Play Time.  Hurd informed Brady Buckley, Vice President of sales for the eastern region, that the Number had been taken from Play Time.  Buckley asked Hurd how much money the Number could be expected to produce.  Hurd was unable to answer the question.  Buckley finally told Hurd:  \"F--- it[;]\" \"leave it alone.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon learning that the Revere office was unable or unwilling to assist him further, Levosky contacted Deborah Surrette, WorldCom Vice President for the Northeast region.  When Levosky explained why the Number was so important to Play Time, Surrette promised to investigate the matter and get back to him.  Surrette asked Kelle Reeves, director of customer provisioning and RESP ORG, to determine whether WorldCom policy had been followed in regard to the Number.  After speaking with several people, but without attempting either to contact the Revere office or to ascertain which customer had first requested the Number, Reeves simply concluded that WorldCom had complied with industry guidelines requiring \"800\" numbers to be allocated on a \"first-come, first-served\" basis, as Eisemann's request had been the first to be entered into SMS/800.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Levosky continued to urge WorldCom to return the Number to Play Time, but was told that industry guidelines prohibited its reassignment.  See supra note 5. Levosky nevertheless maintained that Play Time had been the first to request the Number.  WorldCom then altered course, explaining that its relationship with Levosky was not controlled by industry guidelines, which govern only the relationship between a RESP ORG and SMS/800.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, WorldCom wrongly represented to Levosky that the problem had been caused by AT &amp; T. According to WorldCom, AT &amp; T had been the RESP ORG for the Number on the date Play Time requested it, but had released the Number to \"spare\" status rather than assigning it to WorldCom.  To the contrary, however, AT &amp; T was never the RESP ORG for the Number after 1993.  Rather, as we have noted, WorldCom itself had been the designated RESP ORG since April 13, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, WorldCom informed Levosky that the documents he had submitted through Shannon, see supra pp. 25-26, had not been received by its San Antonio office until after the May 20th request from Eisemann, even though a WorldCom employee in San Antonio had confirmed receipt of the Levosky paperwork on May 13.  Play Time brought suit against WorldCom on November 9, 1994, demanding damages and specific performance.  Shortly after Eisemann was named an indispensable party in relation to the specific performance claim--because he still controlled the Number--he changed long-distance carriers to prevent WorldCom from returning the Number to Play Time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Play Time then offered Eisemann an immediate $5,000 non-refundable deposit and an additional $45,000 following trial, in return for the Number.  At the same time, it offered to dismiss its action against Eisemann if he would testify to the value of the Number.  Eisemann countered with a demand for a $10,000 non-refundable deposit and $40,000 after trial.  Their negotiations ultimately fell through because Play Time could not come up with the additional $5,000 non-refundable deposit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eisemann nevertheless testified at trial that the Number did have inherent value, explaining that \"people would buy the [vanity] number for [its] potential value.\"   He produced a pamphlet he had developed for marketing the Number, touting the importance of vanity numbers in reaching potential customers.  Although Eisemann acknowledged that he was motivated to enter into an agreement with Levosky in part because he wanted to get Levosky \"out of his hair,\" he consistently maintained that the Number had inherent value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned verdicts for Play Time on all counts, awarding $50,000 in damages on each count, representing the value of the Number under a \"willing-transferor-willing-transferee\" standard.  The total award was limited to $50,000, however, because the jury determined that recovery under more than one count would be redundant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a later hearing, the presiding judge found that WorldCom had violated Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11, which affords civil relief from unfair or deceptive business practices.  The court determined WorldCom's conduct both unfair and deceptive, and held that it had occurred \"primarily and substantially\" within Massachusetts.  Accordingly, the court trebled the $50,000 damages award made by the jury, see Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11 (1984), and awarded attorney fees and costs under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A and the Federal Communications Act.  Finally, the equitable claim for specific performance was dismissed as moot.  WorldCom promptly appealed from the $233,334.84 judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>1. Jury Instructions and Verdict Form</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WorldCom claims the district court erred in instructing the jury to apply a \"willing-transferor-willing-transferee\" standard for measuring damages.  It maintains that \"800\" numbers are without inherent value as a matter of law, since it would violate industry guidelines and public policy to allow telephone numbers to be bought and sold on the open market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the trial, Play Time made it very clear that it was demanding the value of the Number.  Early on, the district court set itself to the task of articulating an appropriate measure of damages.  WorldCom voiced no objection to the district court's proposed articulation of the measure of damages until after the close of the evidence.  At that time, its trial counsel offered two cursory observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, WorldCom stated that the measure of damages on the negligence claim should be different from that on the contract claim.  Its second observation appears in the following exchange:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>WorldCom:  Your Honor, just for the record, I haven't made any comments on the willing-assignor-willing-assignee theory.

I don't think I do other than simply to ask you to instruct the jury in accordance with my requested instruction on damages, and I expect that's what I'll simply do after closings.  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record on appeal neither contains a proposed instruction by WorldCom nor reflects the grounds for its objection to the instruction given by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The special verdict form included a statement of the issues relating to the \"willing-transferor-willing-transferee\" standard, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>1(c).

You, as decisionmakers on this question of value, are directed to envision not the usual arm's-length transactions between real-life bargainers, but instead a transaction of the hypothetical variety--indeed of a contrary to fact variety.  If the reality is that in human experience a property interest exactly like that transferred in this case has not been transferred in an arm's-length transaction between real people, you must imagine a transaction not exactly like any transaction described in the evidence before you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These hypothetical persons, the willing transferor and willing transferee, always come to an agreement.

They are only tools.  The willing transferor and willing transferee do not overlook relevant evidence.  They weigh every relevant factor.  They are not experts, but they are attentive to expert advice.  But in the end they make a pragmatic decision that enables them to come to a common value after evaluating all of the evidence and arguments before them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury charge had been delivered, the presiding judge invited objections to the charge and the special verdict form.  At that point, WorldCom simply registered its objection to the \"instruction on the measure of damages\" relating to the \"willing-transferor-willing-transferee\" standard.  The district court overruled the objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Objections to jury instructions are governed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 51, which provides in relevant part that \"[n]o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless that party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 51 (emphasis added).

Here, however, WorldCom interposed no record objection to the special verdict form, as distinguished from the jury charge defining \"the measure of damages.\"   Moreover, WorldCom articulated no grounds whatsoever for its objection to the special verdict form or the jury charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Failure to object with the requisite particularity forfeits review under the \"harmless error \" rule.

See Scarfo, 54 F.3d at 940.   WorldCom can demonstrate no miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the \"fair market value\" standard defined by the district court, see supra 28-29, provided the jury with a just and reasonable measure of damages under Massachusetts law in these circumstances.  See Mechanics Nat'l.  Bank of Worcester v. Killeen, 377 Mass. 100, 384 N.E.2d 1231, 1239 (1979) (holding, in action for breach of contract caused by wrongful foreclosure and sale of shares of stock, plaintiff was \"entitled to recover the fair market value of the stock at the time of its sale\");  Hall v. Paine, 224 Mass. 62, 112 N.E. 153, 155 (1916) (holding that \"fair market value\" was proper measure of damages for stock broker's breach of margin agreement caused by sale of plaintiff's shares without authorization;  noting that, generally speaking, fair market value is proper measure of damages for breach of contract relating to sale of goods which have an ascertainable value on the market).  Thus, at the very least, the \"fair market value\" standard articulated by the district court effectively foreclosed WorldCom's claim of error under the \"plain error\" (\"miscarriage of justice.\") standard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  The failure [to] instruct the jury on a measure of damages other than the fair market value cannot meet either standard, however, especially since the challenged instruction outlined a fair and reasonable measure of damages, and no other standard was proposed below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WorldCom misses the mark with its argument that the Number had no market value because its sale, brokering, barter, or release for a consideration was prohibited.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  Quite the contrary, the pertinent Industry Guideline explicitly acknowledges the ultimate right of \"800 Service End-User Subscriber[s] ... to control their 800 Service, and their reserved, active, or assigned 800 Service Numbers.\"   Industry Guidelines for 800 Number Administration 2.2.1, p 3 (Issue 3.0, December 1, 1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Instead, industry guidelines prohibit only RESP ORGs and \"800\" Service Providers from trading \"800\" numbers for valuable consideration.

Consequently, WorldCom failed to establish that any right to use the Number was valueless as a matter of law, let alone that any \"error seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Lash, 943 F.2d at 152 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.

See Fed.R.Civ.P. 50.  It assigns two errors:  (i) Play Time failed to establish recoverable damages, and (ii) sustained no damages from any WorldCom negligence.  As WorldCom maintains that Play Time failed to prove to a reasonable certainty that it sustained any damages as a result of its failure to assign the Number to Play Time, we must inquire whether Play Time presented enough evidence to enable a reasonable jury to determine, to the requisite degree of certainty, the value of the Number.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our inquiry is guided by Massachusetts law:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p>The fundamental principle of law upon which damages for breach of contract are assessed is that the injured party shall be placed in the same position he would have been in, if the contract had been performed, so far as loss can be ascertained to have followed as a natural consequence and to have been within the contemplation of the parties as reasonable men as a probable result of the breach, and so far as compensation therefor in money can be computed by rational methods upon a firm basis of facts....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">John Hetherington &amp; Sons, Ltd. v.

Eisemann testified, based on his considerable experience in the real estate leasing field, that the Number, like other vanity numbers, had inherent value for which would-be users were willing to pay.  In addition, Eisemann and Levosky testified to their efforts to close the deal whereby Levosky was to acquire from Eisemann the right to use the Number at the agreed $50,000 price.  Although their deal could not be consummated, it was not due to their inability to agree on value:  Levosky offered $50,000 for the Number;  Eisemann was amenable to accepting $50,000, but wanted a larger downpayment, which Play Time was unable to manage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WorldCom focuses on an admission by Eisemann that he was motivated, in part, to release his rights to the Number in order to get Levosky, who had named him as a party defendant in the lawsuit, \"out of his hair.\"   WorldCom relies also on a letter from Play Time's counsel to Eisemann, which provided in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>My client, Play-Time, offers to enter into an option agreement whereby Play-Time pays you (or the entity that controls the Number, if different from you), $5000.00 for the option to purchase the right to use the Number for a total of $50,000.00 (i.e., $45,000.00 plus the $5000.00 down payment).  In addition, Play-Time would waive its claims against you for specific performance, in exchange for your full cooperation in providing credible testimony as to the fair market value of the Number, the details of which can be worked out later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)   WorldCom argues that this letter makes it clear that at least a portion of the $50,000 agreed upon by Eisemann and Levosky represented the value of Play Time's agreement to drop its lawsuit against Eisemann.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although WorldCom proposes an entirely reasonable interpretation, another is that the letter memorializes two distinct offers:  the first to pay a total of $50,000 for Eisemann's rights in the Number;  the second to drop the claims against Eisemann in exchange for Eisemann's trial testimony as to the value of the Number.  Thus, the WorldCom contention that the $50,000 figure had not been based entirely on the value of the Number did not preclude a reasonable jury finding to the contrary.  Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence on damages was adequate to withstand the WorldCom motion for summary judgment, and that the district court committed no error in submitting the case to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.

Clinton Hosp. Ass'n. v. Corson Group, Inc., 907 F.2d 1260, 1264 (1st Cir.1990).  On the other hand, the district court's ruling that WorldCom failed to carry its burden of proving that its conduct \"primarily and substantially\" occurred outside Massachusetts, see Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11, raises a question of law for de novo review.  Roche v. Royal Bank of Canada, 109 F.3d 820, 829 (1st Cir.1997);  see also Clinton Hosp., 907 F.2d at 1264.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining that WorldCom's actions were unfair and deceptive, the district court focused especially on the conduct of Joseph Shannon, which it considered entirely appropriate but for WorldCom's extant agreement with Levosky.  The court also relied on the testimony of Charles Hurd, Shannon's supervisor, who expressed the view that WorldCom management had mistreated Play Time.  Finally, the court identified the off-color remark by Brady Buckley, see supra p. 26, as \"perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of [WorldCom]'s thumb-their-nose attitude.\" As the district court determined, all these actions took place entirely within Massachusetts.  The district court further found that the investigation conducted by Deborah Surrette and Kelle Reeves amounted to mere \"window dressing,\" thereby enhancing the deceptiveness and unfairness to Play Time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WorldCom mounts no serious challenge to these district court findings.  Instead, it argues that most of the allegedly unfair and deceptive conduct took place outside Massachusetts.  In particular, it accurately points out that the Number was assigned to Eisemann by a salesperson in Indiana and that the ultimate decision to allow Eisemann to retain the Number was made in New Jersey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court has outlined a \"pragmatic, functional approach,\" Roche, 109 F.3d at 829;  see also Makino, U.S.A., Inc. v. Metlife Capital Credit Corp., 25 Mass.App.Ct. 302, 518 N.E.2d 519, 523-24 (1988), further app. rev. denied, 402 Mass. 1101, 521 N.E.2d 398 (1988), for determining whether alleged misconduct occurred \"primarily and substantially\" in Massachusetts.  See Bushkin Assocs., Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 393 Mass. 622, 473 N.E.2d 662, 672 (1985).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a>  Its approach has been distilled into three principal inquiries:  \"(1) where the defendant committed the deception;  (2) where plaintiff was deceived and acted on the deception;  and (3) the situs of plaintiff's losses due to the deception.\"  Roche, 109 F.3d at 829;  see also Clinton Hosp., 907 F.2d at 1265-66;  Bushkin, 473 N.E.2d at 672.   As we noted in Clinton Hospital, however, in approaching the second Bushkin inquiry the location of the person to whom the deceptive statements are made is of special significance, as distinguished from the location of the person who uttered the deceptive statements, since \"[t]he victim's ingestion of a deceptive statement and the subsequent effects from reliance on it are what give the deceptive statement its venomous sting.\"  Clinton Hosp., 907 F.2d at 1265-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court analyzed only the first Bushkin factor, finding that the conduct on which it focused--in particular, the actions of Joseph Shannon and Brady Buckley, see supra p. 25-26--all took place in Massachusetts.  We have explained, however, that the first Bushkin factor is the least weighty.  Roche, 109 F.3d at 829;  see also Compagnie De Reassurance D'Ile De France v. New England Reinsurance Corp., 57 F.3d 56, 90 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 564, 133 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995);  Clinton Hosp., 907 F.2d at 1265-66.   Although we agree with the district court, other weightier factors cut against WorldCom as well.  All the unfair or deceptive statements made by WorldCom's agents were visited upon Play Time in Massachusetts.  It was there that Levosky dealt with Joseph Shannon;  learned that WorldCom's Revere office would not try to retain the Number for Play Time because Buckley believed any potential revenues were inconsequential;  learned the results of Surrette's superficial investigation;  and was provided with the numerous pretexts by WorldCom for not obtaining the Number for Play Time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WorldCom, on the other hand, misplaces primary reliance on the location of the WorldCom agents who made the ultimate adverse decision (Surrette and Reeves in New Jersey), and the WorldCom sales office (Indiana) which obtained the Number for Eisemann.  But the district court did not find the actions of the Indiana sales agent part and parcel of WorldCom's unfair or deceptive conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Moreover, as we have noted, the first Bushkin factor is the least weighty.  Finally, the location of Surrette and Reeves is insufficient to overcome the competing evidence which must be weighed under the other Bushkin factors--including Levosky's receipt of the results of the Surrette and Reeves \"investigation\" in Massachusetts--all of which indicates that the unfair and deceptive behavior took place primarily and substantially within Massachusetts.  Thus, WorldCom failed to carry its burden of proving that the Chapter 93A claim was not actionable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we conclude that all contentions raised by WorldCom on appeal were waived or meritless, the district court judgment is affirmed.

Among the factors to be considered are:  whether the failure to raise the claim below deprived the reviewing court of helpful factfinding;  whether the issue is one of constitutional magnitude;  whether the omitted argument is highly persuasive;  whether the opponent would suffer any special prejudice;  whether the omission was inadvertent or deliberate;  and, perhaps most importantly, whether the issue is of great importance to the public.

See also 9 MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE &#167; 51.21. Our case, which implicates only the question of damages for breach of a private agreement between the litigants, presents no issue of great public importance or constitutional magnitude;  the Harwood factors, therefore, weigh in favor of Play Time.  Nor does the present case implicate the integrity of the judicial process, as the proceedings below were conducted with meticulous attention to the rights of both parties.

All \"800\" numbers are reserved and assigned to subscribers by so-called Responsible Organizations (\"RESP ORGs\") through SMS/800.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1994, Play Time, a Massachusetts-based, family-owned corporation engaged in selling art supplies, was endeavoring to expand into nationwide telephonic networking aimed at the commercial real estate leasing market.  Michael Levosky, a Play Time shareholder and co-manager, envisioned a nationwide referral service through which potential customers could call a toll-free \"800\" number and enter information into an automated call router which would link the caller to a real estate office near the place the caller wanted to lease commercial real estate.  Play Time would generate income from the fees charged real estate brokers for their advertising and usage of the toll-free \"800\" number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To that end, Play Time set out to obtain a suitable vanity number, one whose alphabetical counterpart conveyed a business message readily identified and remembered by targeted customers.  Levosky decided to obtain 1-800-\"367-5327\" (\"the Number\"), which would transpose as \"FOR-LEAS[E].\"  WorldCom advised Levosky that the Number, though not then in use, was expected to become available a few weeks later, on or about April 20, 1994.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Levosky called the WorldCom office in Revere, Massachusetts, which handled other telephone business for Play Time, and spoke with the \"800\" coordinator, Martha Burton, who confirmed that the Number would become available in mid-April.  Burton assured Levosky that she would obtain the Number through SMS/800 and assign it to Play Time once it attained \"spare\" status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 20, 1994, one week after WorldCom became the RESP ORG for the Number, and the day the Number was to revert to \"spare\" status, Levosky reminded WorldCom to assign the Number to Play Time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Notwithstanding that WorldCom had been designated the RESP ORG for the Number, however, it did not do so.  Levosky called WorldCom frequently between April 20 and May 10, 1994, to ascertain why the Number had not yet been assigned to Play Time, only to be told essentially that WorldCom was checking into it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 11, 1994, Levosky called Joseph Shannon, a senior account executive in WorldCom's Revere office, who assured Levosky that the Number could be assigned to Play Time once the appropriate paperwork had been completed.  Levosky promptly executed the required documents and returned them to Shannon the same day;  Shannon faxed them to the WorldCom RESP ORG office in San Antonio on May 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the WorldCom fax machine in the Revere office printed a receipt reflecting that the fax had been received in San Antonio on May 12, when Shannon called the San Antonio office on May 13 he was informed that the documents had never been received.  Once again Shannon faxed the documents.  Although the second set of documents was received in San Antonio on May 13, as confirmed by telephone, still the Number was not assigned to Play Time.  Shannon was told the delay was due to difficulty in getting the Number released from SMS/800, notwithstanding the fact that WorldCom was already the RESP ORG for the Number.  But see supra note 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, one Michael Eisemann had asked a WorldCom office in Indiana to obtain the Number for his real estate business.  Eisemann intended to use the Number in a nationwide referral system similar to that envisioned by Levosky.  On May 20, 1994, approximately two months after Levosky first made a verbal request for the Number and nine days after Levosky's first written request, Eisemann submitted the order to the WorldCom office in Indiana, with the required paperwork.  Levosky's earlier requests notwithstanding, WorldCom assigned the Number to Eisemann, because its Revere office had never entered Play Time's request into SMS/800.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unaware that Eisemann had obtained the Number, Levosky continued to inquire into its status.  Although Levosky was told there had been some delay due to paperwork problems, Shannon advised him that the problems had been resolved and the Number would soon be assigned to Play Time.  On May 26, Levosky dialed the Number to determine whether it would ring at Play Time's office.  The call was answered instead by an employee in a Detroit, Michigan, maintenance office.  Whereupon Levosky contacted WorldCom, only to be informed that there had been a computer \"glitch.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although WorldCom switched the Number to Play Time on May 27, by May 31 it was once again ringing at the Detroit maintenance office.  The Number changed hands between Levosky and Eisemann four more times between May 31 and June 2, ultimately remaining with Eisemann.  On June 2, Shannon tracked down the Indiana sales representative responsible for assigning the Number to Eisemann, and learned for the first time that Eisemann too had requested the Number.  After Shannon informed Levosky of the problem, Levosky complained that WorldCom originally had retrieved the Number from SMS/800 at his request, more than two months earlier.  Levosky then asked WorldCom to disconnect the Number pending an investigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shannon and his supervisor, Charles Hurd, approached senior WorldCom management in the Revere office, urging that the Number be returned to Play Time.  Hurd informed Brady Buckley, Vice President of sales for the eastern region, that the Number had been taken from Play Time.  Buckley asked Hurd how much money the Number could be expected to produce.  Hurd was unable to answer the question.  Buckley finally told Hurd:  \"F--- it[;]\" \"leave it alone.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon learning that the Revere office was unable or unwilling to assist him further, Levosky contacted Deborah Surrette, WorldCom Vice President for the Northeast region.  When Levosky explained why the Number was so important to Play Time, Surrette promised to investigate the matter and get back to him.  Surrette asked Kelle Reeves, director of customer provisioning and RESP ORG, to determine whether WorldCom policy had been followed in regard to the Number.  After speaking with several people, but without attempting either to contact the Revere office or to ascertain which customer had first requested the Number, Reeves simply concluded that WorldCom had complied with industry guidelines requiring \"800\" numbers to be allocated on a \"first-come, first-served\" basis, as Eisemann's request had been the first to be entered into SMS/800.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Levosky continued to urge WorldCom to return the Number to Play Time, but was told that industry guidelines prohibited its reassignment.  See supra note 5. Levosky nevertheless maintained that Play Time had been the first to request the Number.  WorldCom then altered course, explaining that its relationship with Levosky was not controlled by industry guidelines, which govern only the relationship between a RESP ORG and SMS/800.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that point, WorldCom wrongly represented to Levosky that the problem had been caused by AT &amp; T. According to WorldCom, AT &amp; T had been the RESP ORG for the Number on the date Play Time requested it, but had released the Number to \"spare\" status rather than assigning it to WorldCom.  To the contrary, however, AT &amp; T was never the RESP ORG for the Number after 1993.  Rather, as we have noted, WorldCom itself had been the designated RESP ORG since April 13, 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, WorldCom informed Levosky that the documents he had submitted through Shannon, see supra pp. 25-26, had not been received by its San Antonio office until after the May 20th request from Eisemann, even though a WorldCom employee in San Antonio had confirmed receipt of the Levosky paperwork on May 13.  Play Time brought suit against WorldCom on November 9, 1994, demanding damages and specific performance.  Shortly after Eisemann was named an indispensable party in relation to the specific performance claim--because he still controlled the Number--he changed long-distance carriers to prevent WorldCom from returning the Number to Play Time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Play Time then offered Eisemann an immediate $5,000 non-refundable deposit and an additional $45,000 following trial, in return for the Number.  At the same time, it offered to dismiss its action against Eisemann if he would testify to the value of the Number.  Eisemann countered with a demand for a $10,000 non-refundable deposit and $40,000 after trial.  Their negotiations ultimately fell through because Play Time could not come up with the additional $5,000 non-refundable deposit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eisemann nevertheless testified at trial that the Number did have inherent value, explaining that \"people would buy the [vanity] number for [its] potential value.\"   He produced a pamphlet he had developed for marketing the Number, touting the importance of vanity numbers in reaching potential customers.  Although Eisemann acknowledged that he was motivated to enter into an agreement with Levosky in part because he wanted to get Levosky \"out of his hair,\" he consistently maintained that the Number had inherent value.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned verdicts for Play Time on all counts, awarding $50,000 in damages on each count, representing the value of the Number under a \"willing-transferor-willing-transferee\" standard.  The total award was limited to $50,000, however, because the jury determined that recovery under more than one count would be redundant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a later hearing, the presiding judge found that WorldCom had violated Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11, which affords civil relief from unfair or deceptive business practices.  The court determined WorldCom's conduct both unfair and deceptive, and held that it had occurred \"primarily and substantially\" within Massachusetts.  Accordingly, the court trebled the $50,000 damages award made by the jury, see Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11 (1984), and awarded attorney fees and costs under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A and the Federal Communications Act.  Finally, the equitable claim for specific performance was dismissed as moot.  WorldCom promptly appealed from the $233,334.84 judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>1. Jury Instructions and Verdict Form</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WorldCom claims the district court erred in instructing the jury to apply a \"willing-transferor-willing-transferee\" standard for measuring damages.  It maintains that \"800\" numbers are without inherent value as a matter of law, since it would violate industry guidelines and public policy to allow telephone numbers to be bought and sold on the open market.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the trial, Play Time made it very clear that it was demanding the value of the Number.  Early on, the district court set itself to the task of articulating an appropriate measure of damages.  WorldCom voiced no objection to the district court's proposed articulation of the measure of damages until after the close of the evidence.  At that time, its trial counsel offered two cursory observations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, WorldCom stated that the measure of damages on the negligence claim should be different from that on the contract claim.

You, as decisionmakers on this question of value, are directed to envision not the usual arm's-length transactions between real-life bargainers, but instead a transaction of the hypothetical variety--indeed of a contrary to fact variety.  If the reality is that in human experience a property interest exactly like that transferred in this case has not been transferred in an arm's-length transaction between real people, you must imagine a transaction not exactly like any transaction described in the evidence before you.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These hypothetical persons, the willing transferor and willing transferee, always come to an agreement.

They are only tools.  The willing transferor and willing transferee do not overlook relevant evidence.  They weigh every relevant factor.  They are not experts, but they are attentive to expert advice.  But in the end they make a pragmatic decision that enables them to come to a common value after evaluating all of the evidence and arguments before them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury charge had been delivered, the presiding judge invited objections to the charge and the special verdict form.  At that point, WorldCom simply registered its objection to the \"instruction on the measure of damages\" relating to the \"willing-transferor-willing-transferee\" standard.

Eisemann testified, based on his considerable experience in the real estate leasing field, that the Number, like other vanity numbers, had inherent value for which would-be users were willing to pay.  In addition, Eisemann and Levosky testified to their efforts to close the deal whereby Levosky was to acquire from Eisemann the right to use the Number at the agreed $50,000 price.  Although their deal could not be consummated, it was not due to their inability to agree on value:  Levosky offered $50,000 for the Number;  Eisemann was amenable to accepting $50,000, but wanted a larger downpayment, which Play Time was unable to manage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WorldCom focuses on an admission by Eisemann that he was motivated, in part, to release his rights to the Number in order to get Levosky, who had named him as a party defendant in the lawsuit, \"out of his hair.\"   WorldCom relies also on a letter from Play Time's counsel to Eisemann, which provided in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p>My client, Play-Time, offers to enter into an option agreement whereby Play-Time pays you (or the entity that controls the Number, if different from you), $5000.00 for the option to purchase the right to use the Number for a total of $50,000.00 (i.e., $45,000.00 plus the $5000.00 down payment).  In addition, Play-Time would waive its claims against you for specific performance, in exchange for your full cooperation in providing credible testimony as to the fair market value of the Number, the details of which can be worked out later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis added.)   WorldCom argues that this letter makes it clear that at least a portion of the $50,000 agreed upon by Eisemann and Levosky represented the value of Play Time's agreement to drop its lawsuit against Eisemann.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although WorldCom proposes an entirely reasonable interpretation, another is that the letter memorializes two distinct offers:  the first to pay a total of $50,000 for Eisemann's rights in the Number;  the second to drop the claims against Eisemann in exchange for Eisemann's trial testimony as to the value of the Number.  Thus, the WorldCom contention that the $50,000 figure had not been based entirely on the value of the Number did not preclude a reasonable jury finding to the contrary.  Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence on damages was adequate to withstand the WorldCom motion for summary judgment, and that the district court committed no error in submitting the case to the jury.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>3.

Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11.  Chapter 93A generally proscribes \"[u]nfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 2 (1984).  An unfair or deceptive practice between businesspeople is not actionable under section 11 unless \"the actions and transactions constituting the alleged unfair method of competition or the unfair act or practice occurred primarily and substantially within the commonwealth.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11 (West Supp.1996).  WorldCom contends that any unfair action in this case did not occur \"primarily and substantially\" within Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court findings on the \"nature, extent, and place of performance\" of WorldCom's actions are reviewed for clear error only.

On the other hand, the district court's ruling that WorldCom failed to carry its burden of proving that its conduct \"primarily and substantially\" occurred outside Massachusetts, see Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  93A, &#167; 11, raises a question of law for de novo review.  Roche v. Royal Bank of Canada, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197279\"><a href=\"/opinion/197279/roche-v-royal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span>, 829 (1st Cir.1997);  see also Clinton Hosp., 907 F.2d at 1264.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining that WorldCom's actions were unfair and deceptive, the district court focused especially on the conduct of Joseph Shannon, which it considered entirely appropriate but for WorldCom's extant agreement with Levosky.  The court also relied on the testimony of Charles Hurd, Shannon's supervisor, who expressed the view that WorldCom management had mistreated Play Time.  Finally, the court identified the off-color remark by Brady Buckley, see supra p. 26, as \"perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of [WorldCom]'s thumb-their-nose attitude.\" As the district court determined, all these actions took place entirely within Massachusetts.  The district court further found that the investigation conducted by Deborah Surrette and Kelle Reeves amounted to mere \"window dressing,\" thereby enhancing the deceptiveness and unfairness to Play Time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WorldCom mounts no serious challenge to these district court findings.  Instead, it argues that most of the allegedly unfair and deceptive conduct took place outside Massachusetts.  In particular, it accurately points out that the Number was assigned to Eisemann by a salesperson in Indiana and that the ultimate decision to allow Eisemann to retain the Number was made in New Jersey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Judicial Court has outlined a \"pragmatic, functional approach,\" Roche, 109 F.3d at 829;  see also Makino, U.S.A., Inc. v.

As we noted in Clinton Hospital, however, in approaching the second Bushkin inquiry the location of the person to whom the deceptive statements are made is of special significance, as distinguished from the location of the person who uttered the deceptive statements, since \"[t]he victim's ingestion of a deceptive statement and the subsequent effects from reliance on it are what give the deceptive statement its venomous sting.\"  Clinton Hosp., 907 F.2d at 1265-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court analyzed only the first Bushkin factor, finding that the conduct on which it focused--in particular, the actions of Joseph Shannon and Brady Buckley, see supra p. 25-26--all took place in Massachusetts.  We have explained, however, that the first Bushkin factor is the least weighty.  Roche, 109 F.3d at 829;  see also Compagnie De Reassurance D'Ile De France v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></span> (1995);  Clinton Hosp., 907 F.2d at 1265-66.   Although we agree with the district court, other weightier factors cut against WorldCom as well.  All the unfair or deceptive statements made by WorldCom's agents were visited upon Play Time in Massachusetts.  It was there that Levosky dealt with Joseph Shannon;  learned that WorldCom's Revere office would not try to retain the Number for Play Time because Buckley believed any potential revenues were inconsequential;  learned the results of Surrette's superficial investigation;  and was provided with the numerous pretexts by WorldCom for not obtaining the Number for Play Time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WorldCom, on the other hand, misplaces primary reliance on the location of the WorldCom agents who made the ultimate adverse decision (Surrette and Reeves in New Jersey), and the WorldCom sales office (Indiana) which obtained the Number for Eisemann.  But the district court did not find the actions of the Indiana sales agent part and parcel of WorldCom's unfair or deceptive conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a>  Moreover, as we have noted, the first Bushkin factor is the least weighty.  Finally, the location of Surrette and Reeves is insufficient to overcome the competing evidence which must be weighed under the other Bushkin factors--including Levosky's receipt of the results of the Surrette and Reeves \"investigation\" in Massachusetts--all of which indicates that the unfair and deceptive behavior took place primarily and substantially within Massachusetts.  Thus, WorldCom failed to carry its burden of proving that the Chapter 93A claim was not actionable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we conclude that all contentions raised by WorldCom on appeal were waived or meritless, the district court judgment is affirmed.
