The main issues presented by this appeal\r\n\nare  whether the  jury's  verdict in  favor  of the  customer\r\n\ndictates that the  verdict against her employer  be reversed;\r\n\nwhether   the  court's   evidentiary  and   juror  peremptory\r\n\nchallenge rulings were  correct; whether  the district  court\r\n\nevinced  bias against the defendants; and whether the court's\r\n\nattorney's fees award was adequate.

See Ansin v. River Oaks Furniture, Inc.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n105 F.3d 745, 749 (1st  Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S.  Ct.\r                                                            \r\n\n70 (1997).\r\n\n          Rodriguez   worked   as  an   office   manager  for\r\n\nOccidental International, a Florida  company with offices  in\r\n\nFlorida  and  Puerto  Rico.   Rodriguez  started  working for\r\n\nOccidental  in  December of  1988 in  the Traffic  and Claims\r\n\ndivision of the Puerto Rico  office.  She was twice promoted,\r\n\nand was put  in charge of overseeing the  daily operations of\r\n\nher office in February of 1990.  While she was never formally\r\r\n\nevaluated during  her employment, Rodriguez  received regular\r\n\npraise for her work, and  before the suspension and dismissal\r\n\nthat led to this lawsuit,  she had never been the subject  of\r\n\ndisciplinary action.\r\n\n          Occidental  International   sells  electrical   and\r\n\nindustrial equipment.  Occidental's most important market was\r\n\nPuerto Rico, and its most  important customer was the  Puerto\r\n\nRico Electric  Power Authority  (\"PREPA\").   At  the time  of\r\n\nRodriguez's  dismissal,  approximately  80%  of  Occidental's\r\n\nbusiness in Puerto Rico was with PREPA.\r\n\n          Omar Chavez was the President and sole  shareholder\r\n\nof  Occidental.   Chavez  lived  in Florida,  and  would make\r\n\nmonthly  business trips  to Puerto  Rico.   Chavez pursued  a\r\n\nnumber  of strategies which he thought would ensure continued\r\n\ngood  relations   between  Occidental   and  its   customers,\r\n\nparticularly  with PREPA.  Evidence presented at trial showed\r\n\nthat Chavez primarily employed young, attractive women, known\r\n\nto customers as \"Occidental Gals,\" and  instructed them to be\r\n\nespecially cordial to PREPA employees.  \r\n\n          Good  relations  were particularly  important  with\r\n\nhigh-ranking PREPA  officials like  Edwin Miranda-Velez,  the\r\n\nChief  of  PREPA's  Materials  Management  Division  and  the\r\n\noverseer of  PREPA's public contracts  for the type  of goods\r\n\nsold  by Occidental.  Chavez introduced Rodriguez to Miranda,\r\n\nand told her that Miranda was very important for Occidental's\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nbusiness and that she and  the other employees should be nice\r\n\nto him and \"keep him satisfied.\"  She was instructed to visit\r\n\nMiranda every time she went to the PREPA offices.\r\n\n          Occidental  pursued  other  strategies.    It  made\r\n\npolitical contributions to  the Popular Democratic  Party, of\r\n\nwhich  Miranda  was  a  very  active  member,  and  solicited\r\n\ndonations on its  behalf.  Chavez financed  social activities\r\n\nfor  PREPA employees  and gave  Christmas  presents to  PREPA\r\n\nofficials.   In December  of 1990, Chavez  threw a  party for\r\n\nPREPA  officials  at a  local  hotel.    The members  of  the\r\n\nOccidental  Puerto Rico staff, all female, were instructed to\r\n\nattend the event unaccompanied, so they would be available to\r\n\ndance with the  PREPA executives.  The  night's entertainment\r\n\nat  that party included a dancing  show performed by scantily\r\n\nclad women.\r\n\n          The  close   relationship  with   PREPA  benefitted\r\n\nOccidental, and Chavez, in several  ways.  Chavez was able to\r\n\nlearn from  Miranda in advance  what bids would be  coming up\r\n\nand  how much Occidental's competitors were bidding.  Miranda\r\n\nhelped to steer  business to Occidental through  requests for\r\n\nproposals  that were  handled  outside  the ordinary  bidding\r\n\nprocess.   For example, Miranda helped Occidental to obtain a\r\n\ntransportation  contract  on an  \"emergency\" basis.   Miranda\r\n\nsigned all pertinent  documentation and recommended  payments\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nto suppliers.   There were also allegations that  Miranda was\r\n\nable to help Occidental avoid trouble over tax disclosures.\r\n\n          Miranda  began  to  make  unwelcome approaches  and\r\n\nsuggestive  comments to  Rodriguez.   He invited  her out  to\r\n\ndinner.  He  asked her to visit his office after hours and on\r\n\nFriday evenings.   He  anonymously sent  her flowers for  her\r\n\nbirthday  and included a  sexually explicit card.   Rodriguez\r\n\ncomplained to Chavez about this behavior; Chavez responded by\r\n\nstressing that Miranda  was an important client,  but assured\r\n\nher that he would deal with the problem.  \r\n\n          The culmination, as it were, of Miranda's  advances\r\n\ncame on February 28, 1992.  Miranda called Rodriguez and told\r\n\nher he  would  come pick  her  up to  take  her to  a  motel.\r\n\nRodriguez, upset  by Miranda's latest advance,  called Chavez\r\n\nto  complain about  Miranda's  call.    Chavez  responded  by\r\n\ndefending Miranda, and  saying that Rodriguez should  respond\r\n\nto Miranda  \"as a woman.\"   Rodriguez told Chavez  that if he\r\n\nwould  do  nothing about  the situation,  she would  take her\r\n\ncomplaints to the Director of PREPA.\r\n\n          That weekend, Chavez flew to Puerto Rico.  On March\r\n\n9, 1992, Chavez  gave Rodriguez a  letter informing her  that\r\n\nshe  was suspended  from work  for thirty  days.   The letter\r\n\nstated the reasons for her suspension as unauthorized  use of\r\n\ncompany property,  contracting  for services  in the  company\r\n\nname without  authorization, and  absenteeism.   On April  6,\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nRodriguez  received  a  second  letter  dismissing  her  from\r\n\nemployment at Occidental.  The grounds for her dismissal were\r\n\nan unexplained  imbalance of $157.00 in petty  cash funds and\r\n\nnegligence  in executing daily  functions such as  picking up\r\n\ncompany mail,  as well as the  problems noted in the  March 9\r\n\nletter.   Rodriguez  had  never been  notified  of  any  such\r\n\ndeficiencies before.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          In  September of 1992,  Rodriguez filed a complaint\r\n\nagainst Occidental  and Chavez  with the  Anti-Discrimination\r\n\nUnit  of the  Puerto Rico  Department of  Labor and  with the\r\n\nEqual  Employment  Opportunity  Commission.   In  November of\r\n\n1992, while that  complaint was before the  agency, Rodriguez\r\n\nsued Miranda  in district  court under 42  U.S.C.    1983 for\r\n\nviolations   of  her  rights  under  the  Fifth,  Ninth,  and\r\n\nFourteenth  Amendments, and sued both Miranda and PREPA under\r\n\nPuerto Rico tort law and the Puerto Rico Constitution.\r\n\n          After  exhausting   her  administrative   remedies,\r\n\nRodriguez received  a right-to-sue  letter from  the EEOC  in\r\n\nJune of  1993 and  amended her complaint  to name  Chavez and\r\n\nOccidental  as defendants.   The  amended complaint  asserted\r\n\nclaims under Title VII  of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964,  42\r\n\nU.S.C.    2000e-2000e-17, as well as claims under Puerto Rico\r\n\nlaw.  \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          In July of 1994, the district court issued an order\r\n\neliminating some of  Rodriguez's claims.  The  district court\r\n\ndismissed  the    1983 claim,  but  not the  Puerto Rico  law\r\n\nclaims, against  Miranda.  Thus  only Puerto Rico  law claims\r\n\nremained  against Miranda  and PREPA,  over  which the  court\r\n\nretained  jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.    1367.  The district\r\n\ncourt granted summary  judgment in favor of  defendant Chavez\r\n\non  Rodriguez's Title VII  claim against Chavez,  but allowed\r\n\nthe Puerto Rico law claims against Chavez to go to  the jury.\r\n\nThus the only federal claim that remained at the start of the\r\n\ntrial was Rodriguez's  Title VII claim against  her employer,\r\n\nOccidental.  The  only claims which went to  the jury against\r\n\nMiranda were based on commonwealth law.\r\n\n          The  trial   was  hotly  contested   and  extremely\r\n\ncontentious.  In the course  of the trial, the district court\r\n\nsanctioned  defense counsel for violating an order in limine.\r\n\nAfter a five week trial,  the jury held Occidental and Chavez\r\n\nliable  to  the plaintiff,  but found  Miranda and  PREPA not\r\n\nliable.   The jury form  simply asked that the  jurors answer\r\n\nyes or no as to whether each of the defendants was \"liable to\r\n\nplaintiff  Sandra Rodriguez.\"  Rodriguez received an award of\r\n\n$200,000  in   compensatory  and  punitive   damages  against\r\n\nOccidental  and Chavez.    The  jury answered  no  as to  the\r\n\ncommonwealth law claims against Miranda.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          The  district  court awarded  Rodriguez  attorney's\r\n\nfees.    But  in  the   face  of  a  documented  request  for\r\n\napproximately $440,000 in  fees and costs, the  court awarded\r\n\nonly $150,223.26.  The district court disallowed some work as\r\n\nduplicative,  some as having been performed by attorneys when\r\n\nthe court thought it should have been done by paralegals, and\r\n\nfurther reduced the award because of the plaintiff's \"lack of\r\n\nsuccess.\"\r\n\n          Occidental and Chavez appeal from  the jury verdict\r\n\nin cases  number  96-1416 and  97-1444,  alleging a  host  of\r\n\nerrors and  demanding a new  trial.  Defense  counsel Inserni\r\n\nappeals in case number 95-2027 from the contempt order issued\r\n\nagainst  him during the  trial.  Plaintiff  cross-appeals, in\r\n\ncase  number 97-1445, arguing that the district court's award\r\n\nof attorney's fees was in error and insufficient.\r\n\n            III.  Appeal of Occidental and Chavez\r\n\nA.  Jury Inconsistency Argument\r                                           \r\n\n          Occidental and  Chavez's flagship  argument, simply\r\n\nput, is that because the jury did not find either  Miranda or\r\n\nPREPA  liable to Rodriguez,  Chavez and Occidental  cannot be\r\n\nheld liable either.  Rodriguez  could not have been dismissed\r\n\nfor refusing  to submit to  (or threatening  to complain  of)\r\n\nMiranda's  advances,  defendants  argue,   because  the  jury\r\n\nverdict  shows that Miranda  never engaged in  the conduct of\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nwhich she  complains.   This  argument  is founded  upon  the\r\n\nerroneous assumption that the jury's verdict that Miranda and\r\n\nPREPA are not \"liable to plaintiff\" under Puerto Rico tort or\r\n\nconstitutional  law necessarily means  that the jury  did not\r\n\nbelieve  that  Miranda made  unwanted  sexual advances,  that\r\n\nRodriguez complained of these advances, and that her employer\r\n\nfired her in response.\r\n\n          The defendants'  argument fails, as the  jury could\r\n\nquite plausibly have  found a set of facts  that would render\r\n\nChavez  and Occidental, but not Miranda and PREPA, \"liable to\r\n\nplaintiff\" on the claims asserted.\r\n\n          In  order to evaluate the defendants' arguments, it\r\n\nis important to  understand the nature of  the claims brought\r\n\nagainst each of the four  defendants in this case.  Rodriguez\r\n\nsued  the  customer, Miranda  and  PREPA on  two  theories --\r\n\nliability  under  Puerto  Rico  tort  law  and  violation  of\r\n\nRodriguez's  rights to \"privacy and dignity\" under the Puerto\r\n\nRico Constitution.   The jury  was instructed  that, to  find\r\n\nMiranda liable to the plaintiff in negligence, it had to find\r\n\n\"that there was  an act or omission, by  fault or negligence,\r\n\nthat caused the plaintiff's injury.\"  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\r                                                     \r\n\n31,   5141  (1991) (\"A person who  by act or omission  causes\r\n\ndamage  to another  through  fault  or  negligence  shall  be\r\n\nobliged to repair  the damage so done.  Concurrent imprudence\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nof  the party aggrieved  does not exempt  from liability, but\r\n\nentails a reduction in the indemnity.\")\r\n\n          For  Miranda to be liable under the Constitution of\r\n\nPuerto Rico, the  jury was instructed that it  must find that\r\n\nMiranda \"engaged  in  conduct  against  the  plaintiff  which\r\n\nadversely affected her dignity, honor, or reputation . . . .\"\r\n\nSee P.R. Const. art. II,   1 (\"The dignity of the human being\r               \r\n\nis  inviolable. .  . .  No  discrimination shall  be made  on\r\n\naccount of .  . . sex  . . .  .\"); P.R. Const.  art. II,    8\r\n\n(\"Every person has the right to the protection of law against\r\n\nabusive  attacks  on  his honor,  reputation  and  private or\r\n\nfamily life.\").  \r\n\n          If  Miranda was not liable to Rodriguez under these\r\n\ntwo  theories,  then  PREPA  could  not  be  found liable  to\r\n\nRodriguez either.   PREPA's liability was only  in respondeat\r\n\nsuperior for the actions of Miranda.\r\n\n          Both of the claims as described to the jury contain\r\n\nan element  of causation.   The jury may simply  have decided\r\n\nthat  Rodriguez's   injuries  resulted  not   from  Miranda's\r\n\nactions, but from  those of Chavez and Occidental.   Thus the\r\n\njury may have  declined to hold  Miranda liable, not  because\r\n\nthe jurors did not believe  that he made sexual advances, but\r\n\nrather  because they  concluded that  this  behavior did  not\r\n\nitself cause the harms Rodriguez suffered.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          In contrast, the  plaintiff asserted four different\r\n\ntheories of liability  against Chavez under Puerto  Rico law,\r\n\nnone of which is inconsistent with the jury's refusal to hold\r\n\nMiranda  and PREPA  liable.    In addition  to  the tort  and\r\n\nconstitutional claims described above, Rodriguez sued  Chavez\r\n\nfor  sex discrimination  and retaliatory  discharge.   Puerto\r\n\nRico's Law 100  forbids sex discrimination by  employers, and\r\n\nprovides for civil liability and damages.  See P.R. Laws Ann.\r                                                          \r\n\ntit.  29,    146 (1995).   Puerto Rico's  Law 17  defines sex\r\n\nharassment  as  a  type of  sex  discrimination,  and forbids\r\n\nretaliation  against  persons  who  \"reject\"  the  employer's\r\n\nsexually discriminatory practices.   See P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.\r                                                    \r\n\n29,    155-155l  (1995).  Under Puerto Rico  law, an employer\r\n\nis  held responsible  for  \"the  acts  of  sexual  harassment\r\n\ntowards his  employees  in  the work  place  by  persons  not\r\n\nemployed by him if the  employer or his agents or supervisors\r\n\nknew or  should have known  of such conduct and  did not take\r\n\nimmediate  and adequate  action  to correct  the  situation.\"\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29,   155f.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff  also  sought  separation  pay  from\r\n\nChavez  and Occidental for unjust dismissal under Puerto Rico\r\n\nLaw 80.   See P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 29,   185a  (1995) (\"Every\r                         \r\n\nemployee  in  commerce .  .  .  who  is discharged  from  his\r\n\nemployment without good  cause, shall be entitled  to receive\r\n\nfrom  his employer,  in addition  to the  salary he  may have\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nearned:  (a)  The  salary  corresponding  to  one  month,  as\r\n\nindemnity; (b) An additional progressive indemnity equivalent\r\n\nto  one  week for  each  year  of  service.\").   Further,  in\r\n\naddition to the same four  causes of action under Puerto Rico\r\n\nlaw  asserted against  Chavez, Rodriguez sued  Occidental for\r\n\nsex discrimination under Title VII.\r\n\n          We  cannot, based on the jury form, determine which\r\n\nof   Rodriguez's  claims   against   Chavez  and   Occidental\r\n\nsucceeded.  The jury was asked only to answer yes or no as to\r\n\nwhether  each  defendant  was  \"liable  to  plaintiff  Sandra\r\n\nRodriguez.\"   The jury  could have  properly decided  to hold\r\n\nChavez  and  Occidental  liable  because  they  discriminated\r\n\nagainst Rodriguez  on the basis  of her sex, or  because they\r\n\nretaliated  against her  for her  complaints about  Miranda's\r\n\nbehavior.  \r\n\n          Sexual  harassment  is  an  unlawful  form  of  sex\r\n\ndiscrimination,  and both Chavez and Occidental could be held\r\n\nliable for sex  harassment on either of two  theories -- quid\r\n\npro quo or hostile work environment.  \r\n\n          Under  the   quid  pro   quo  theory,   Rodriguez's\r\n\ncontinued  employment  was  conditioned  on  coerced  sex,  a\r\n\ncondition that was  inherently linked to her  gender.  Puerto\r\n\nRico  law, see  P.R. Laws  Ann.  tit. 29,    155f,  and other\r                          \r\n\ncircuits,  interpreting Title VII,  have said  that employers\r\n\ncan be liable for a  customer's unwanted sexual advances,  if\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nthe  employer  ratifies  or   acquiesces  in  the  customer's\r\n\ndemands.  See  Folkerson v. Circus Circus  Enters., Inc., 107\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.3d 754,  756 (9th  Cir. 1997).   This  is a  case in  which\r\n\nRodriguez's employer  not only acquiesced  in the  customer's\r\n\ndemands, but explicitly told her  to give in to those demands\r\n\nand satisfy the customer.  This conduct is clearly an example\r\n\nof  quid pro quo  sexual harassment, as  Rodriguez's employer\r\n\nconditioned her  future with the company on her responding to\r\n\nthe unwanted sexual demands of a customer.\r\n\n          Under  the hostile work  environment theory  of sex\r\n\ndiscrimination,  the jury  could  have reasonably  found that\r\n\nChavez and Occidental  had established a  working environment\r\n\nhostile to women.   The jury was instructed  that this theory\r\n\nof  sex discrimination  \"involves  forms of  sexually-related\r\n\nmisconduct which  are severe  and pervasive  and unreasonably\r\n\ninterfere  with  work   performance  or  create  a   hostile,\r\n\nintimidating  or  offensive  working  environment.    It  can\r\n\ninclude  demeaning  comments  or  expectations  of  a certain\r\n\nsexual behavior in the workplace.\"  This environment would be\r\n\na product not  only of Chavez's refusal to  do anything about\r\n\nMiranda's advances, but  also of incidents  such as the  1990\r\n\nChristmas party.\r\n\n          Likewise, the success  of a retaliation claim  does\r\n\nnot  require  that  the alleged  wrongful  conduct  itself be\r\n\nillegal.   For her  retaliation claim  to succeed,  Rodriguez\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nmerely needed to show that she \"reasonably believed\" that the\r\n\nconduct of  which she  complained or  threatened to  complain\r\n\nviolated Title VII.  See Wyatt v. City of Boston, 35 F.3d 13,\r                                                            \r\n\n15 (1st Cir. 1994);  Petitti v. New England Tel.  &amp; Tel. Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n909 F.2d 28, 33 (1st  Cir. 1990); Drinkwater v. Union Carbide\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp.,  904 F.2d 853, 865 (3d  Cir. 1990) (noting that a long\r                 \r\n\nline  of  cases   holds  that  a  \"plaintiff   establishes  a\r\n\nretaliation claim  if she  shows that  she  had a  reasonable\r\n\nbelief  that  the   employer  was  engaged  in   an  unlawful\r\n\nemployment practice and that the employer  retaliated against\r\n\nher for protesting that practice.\").  The jury may have found\r\n\nthat the close relationship between PREPA and Occidental made\r\n\nit  reasonable   for  Rodriguez  to  believe  that  Miranda's\r\n\nunwanted  advances  constituted  unlawful  sexual  harassment\r\n\nabout which she had a right to complain.\r\n\nB.  Peremptory Challenges\r                                     \r\n\n          Defendants   challenge    the   district    court's\r\n\ndisallowance  of two of their peremptory challenges.  Because\r\n\nthis  determination is fact-sensitive, we review it for clear\r\n\nerror.   See Brewer v.  Marshall, 119 F.3d 993,  1004-05 (1st\r                                            \r\n\nCir.  1997); see  also Purkett  v.  Elem, 514  U.S. 765,  767\r                                                    \r\n\n(1995) (per  curiam).  Initial  juror selection in  this case\r\n\nbegan with a panel of  sixteen jurors containing nine men and\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\nseven   women.    The  court  then  granted  each  side  four\r\n\nperemptory challenges, leaving eight jurors.  \r\n\n          Plaintiff  objected to the  defendants' use  of all\r\n\nfour of their peremptory challenges to exclude women from the\r\n\njury panel, arguing  that these peremptory challenges  were a\r\n\nviolation  of the  Equal Protection  Clause  under J.E.B.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nAlabama ex rel. T.B., 511  U.S. 127 (1994) (extending  Batson\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Kentucky, 476 U.S.  79 (1986) to  gender-based peremptory\r                        \r\n\nchallenges in civil  cases).  The defendants  explained their\r\n\nchallenges on gender-neutral grounds, but the  district court\r\n\ndisallowed two of the peremptory challenges, stating that the\r\n\nexplanations   were   merely    a   pretext   for    unlawful\r\n\ndiscrimination.\r\n\n          The  district  court  noted,  properly,  that   its\r\n\ndecision  to disallow the two peremptory challenges was based\r\n\non the totality of the  circumstances of the litigation.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nHernandez  v. New  York,  500  U.S. 352,  364  (1991).

Evidentiary Rulings\r                                   \r\n\n          We review  a district  court's evidentiary  rulings\r\n\nfor abuse  of discretion.   See General Elec. Co.  v.

See Harrison v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 981 F.2d 25, 29-\r                                                       \r\n\n30 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\n\n1.  Rulings under Rule 412\r                                      \r\n\n          Defendants continually  sought to make an  issue of\r\n\nplaintiff's   sexual  history.     In  the  course   of  this\r\n\nlitigation, defendants attempted  to paint  the plaintiff  as\r\n\nsexually insatiable,  as  engaging in  multiple affairs  with\r\n\nmarried men, as  a lesbian, and as suffering  from a sexually\r\n\ntransmitted  disease.2  Defendants claimed that plaintiff had\r\n\nan  affair with  a  married  man that  caused  her to  become\r\n\ndistracted from work, and led to the lapses for which she was\r\n\nfired.\r\n\n          Fed. R. Evid. 412 was designed to prevent misuse of\r\n\na  complainant's sexual history  in cases  involving \"alleged\r\n\nsexual misconduct.\"   In a civil case, the  sole exception to\r\n\nRule 412's prohibition of evidence offered to prove \"that any\r\n\nalleged  victim engaged  in other  sexual  behavior\" or  \"any\r\n\nalleged victim's sexual predisposition\" is that\r\n\n        evidence offered to prove the sexual behavior\r\n        or  sexual  predisposition   of  any  alleged\r\n        victim  is  admissible  if  it  is  otherwise\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  During  discovery,  defendants requested  that  plaintiff\r\nsubmit  to an  AIDS test,  apparently  to substantiate  their\r\nallegations of promiscuity.  The request was denied.\r\n\n                             -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n        admissible   under   these  rules   and   its\r                                                                 \r\n        probative value  substantially outweighs  the\r                                                                 \r\n        danger  of harm to  any victim and  of unfair\r                                                                 \r\n        prejudice  to any  party.    Evidence  of  an\r                                            \r\n        alleged  victim's  reputation  is  admissible\r\n        only  if it has been placed in controversy by\r\n        the alleged victim.\r\n\nFed.  R. Evid.  412(b)(2)  (emphasis added).   Rule  412 thus\r\n\nreverses the usual  approach of the Federal Rules of Evidence\r\n\non admissibility  by requiring that the  evidence's probative\r\n\nvalue \"substantially outweigh\" its prejudicial effect.  \r\n\n          Rule  412  mandates procedural  safeguards  for the\r\n\nintroduction of such evidence under the  412(b)(2) exception.\r\n\nA party intending  to offer such evidence must  file a motion\r\n\nspecifically describing the evidence and its purpose at least\r\n\nfourteen days before trial, serve  the motion on all parties,\r\n\nand notify the alleged victim.  Before admitting the evidence\r\n\nthe court  must conduct  an in camera  hearing to  afford the\r\n\nvictim and parties  a right to be  heard.  See Fed.  R. Evid.\r                                                          \r\n\n412(c).\r\n\n          The district court  ruled that evidence  concerning\r\n\nplaintiff's  moral character  or promiscuity and  the marital\r\n\nstatus of her boyfriend was inadmissible under Rule 412.  But\r\n\nthe court  allowed defendants to introduce  evidence directly\r\n\nrelevant  to  their   theory  that  plaintiff's  relationship\r\n\ndistracted her from work.   The court also held that evidence\r\n\nconcerning plaintiff's allegedly  flirtatious behavior toward\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nMiranda  was   admissible  to  determine   whether  Miranda's\r\n\nadvances were in fact \"unwanted.\"\r\n\n          These  evidentiary  rulings  were  well within  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's discretion.  The court struck an acceptable\r\n\nbalance between the danger of undue prejudice and the need to\r\n\npresent  the  jury  with relevant  evidence,  particularly in\r\n\nlight of Rule 412's special standard of admissibility.\r\n\n2.  Rulings under Rule 403\r                                      \r\n\n          Nor  is  there  any  abuse  of  discretion  in  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's other evidentiary  rulings.  Under  Fed. R.\r\n\nEvid.  402,  all  relevant  evidence  is  admissible   unless\r\n\notherwise provided  by federal law.   See Fed. R.  Evid. 402.\r                                                     \r\n\nUnder Fed. R. Evid. 403, relevant evidence may be excluded if\r\n\nits  probative value  is  \"substantially  outweighed\" by  the\r\n\ndanger of prejudice or confusion.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403.  \r                                                  \r\n\n          Defendants  challenge  the   exclusion  of  certain\r\n\ntelephone  records, rebuttal evidence  by some of plaintiff's\r\n\nco-workers, and an answering machine tape.  We agree with the\r\n\ndistrict court  that the  testimony and  phone records  would\r\n\nhave been, at best, cumulative.  The district court conducted\r\n\nlengthy proceedings  over the  admissibility of  an answering\r\n\nmachine tape  produced by  Chavez that  purportedly contained\r\n\nseveral  messages from Rodriguez  to Chavez that  could imply\r\n\nthat they had been intimate.   The defendants argue that this\r\n\npiece  of evidence would  have shown that  \"plaintiff treated\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nChavez  affectionately and could not have been complaining of\r\n\nsexual harassment.\"  An FBI analysis of the voice on the tape\r\n\nwas  inconclusive.    The  court  ruled  that  the  tape  was\r\n\ninadmissible under Fed. R. Evid.  403, and we agree that this\r\n\ndubious evidence had  minimal probative value, and  had great\r\n\npotential to confuse the jury.\r\n\n          Defendants complain of  a \"double standard\" because\r\n\nthe  district   court  allowed   information  introduced   by\r\n\nplaintiff while excluding  evidence introduced by  defendant.\r\n\nThe  court allowed evidence concerning the close ties between\r\n\nOccidental  and   PREPA,  including  evidence   of  political\r\n\ndonations, Occidental's tax  status, the dancing show  at the\r\n\n1990  Christmas party,  and a  letter  regarding Occidental's\r\n\nsales volume.  In fact, as to the  excluded evidence, Fed. R.\r\n\nEvid. 412  required the  district court  to apply a  stricter\r                               \r\n\nstandard  with regard to admission of evidence of plaintiff's\r\n\nsexual history than to  the evidence admitted under the  more\r\n\nliberal standard of Fed. R.  Evid. 402 &amp; 403.   This evidence\r\n\nwas  directly relevant to  the theory of  Rodriguez's case --\r\n\nthat Chavez and Occidental were  willing to fire her when she\r\n\ncomplained about  Miranda in  order to  maintain their  close\r\n\nrelationship with Miranda and PREPA.\r\n\n          Having  examined  each  of  the  district   court's\r\n\nevidentiary rulings, we find none that represents an abuse of\r\n\nits discretion.  Even if  the court's exclusions were  error,\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nnone of the excluded evidence would have had an impact on the\r\n\noutcome  of  the  trial,  as  it  would  have  at  best  been\r\n\nduplicative of evidence that was admitted.\r\n\nD.  Claims of Judicial Bias\r                                       \r\n\n          Occidental and Chavez argue that the district court\r\n\njudge's  admonitions to  defense counsel  evince bias,  which\r\n\ntainted  the jury  verdict.   They claim  that this  bias was\r\n\nfurther  demonstrated  by  the  judge's  rulings  on  defense\r\n\ncounsel's peremptory  challenges, exclusion of  evidence, and\r\n\nhis sanctioning defense counsel for violating an  evidentiary\r\n\nruling under  Fed. R. Evid.  412.  The contested  rulings are\r\n\ndiscussed elsewhere, and they were  entirely proper.  Most of\r\n\nthe comments  appellants complain  of were  made outside  the\r\n\nhearing of the jury.  \r\n\n          At the  very latest,  this claim  should have  been\r\n\nraised  in defendants'  Rule 50  motion  before the  district\r\n\ncourt.   It is  therefore waived.   See In  re Abijoe  Realty\r                                                                         \r\n\nCorp.,  943 F.2d  121, 126-27  (1st  Cir. 1991).   Claims  of\r                 \r\n\njudicial partiality  must be  raised at  the earliest  moment\r\n\nthat a litigant becomes cognizant of the purported bias,  and\r\n\ncertainly not for the first time on appeal.  See id.;  cf. In\r                                                                         \r\n\nre Marisol Martinez-Catala, 129 F.3d 213, 219 (1st Cir. 1997)\r                                      \r\n\n(explaining  procedures  for  judicial  disqualification  and\r\n\nnoting that \"disqualification is almost never required  where\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nthe judge's opinions are based on the proceedings\").  A party\r\n\nmay not simply wait to see what outcome he or she receives in\r\n\na trial before an allegedly  biased judge.  See In re  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nShoe Mach.

The isolated, occasional comments cited by appellants\r\n\nfall  far  short  of  prejudice  and do  not  come  close  to\r\n\nsupporting  a contention that  defendants were deprived  of a\r\n\nfair trial.  See United States v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 294-95\r                                                   \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990); Aggarwal v. Ponce Sch. of Med., 837 F.2d 17,\r                                                           \r\n\n22 (1st Cir. 1988).  The judge's scattered critical  comments\r\n\nwere largely made out of the jury's hearing, and usually were\r\n\nin  direct response  to defense  counsel's interruptions  and\r\n\nunsuitable conduct.   See United States  v. Polito, 856  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n414,  418 (1st Cir.  1988) (\"Charges of  partiality should be\r\n\njudged  not on an isolated comment  or two, but on the record\r\n\nas a whole.\").  The  entirety of the record reveals  that the\r\n\njudge evinced  not bias, but  rather a desire to  conduct the\r\n\ntrial  in as  civil a manner  as possible.   That  desire was\r\n\nevidently  not  shared  by counsel  for  the  defendants, and\r\n\nrebukes for this lack of civility were entirely warranted.\r\n\n           IV.  The Sanction Order Against Counsel\r\n\n          Attorney  Inserni  appeals   the  district  court's\r\n\n                             -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\ndecision   to  sanction  him  for  violating  a  court  order\r\n\nprohibiting mention of matters such  as the marital status of\r\n\nplaintiff's boyfriend  without first  clearing such  evidence\r\n\nwith the  court to allow it to make  a final Rule 412 ruling.\r\n\nDuring  plaintiff's  testimony,  the  court  ruled  that  the\r\n\nmarital status of plaintiff's  boyfriend was not  admissible,\r\n\nand  admonished counsel to  approach the bench  before asking\r\n\nany  question that  might  raise  concerns  under  Rule  412.\r\n\nAttorney Inserni subsequently asked plaintiff's psychologist,\r\n\nin front  of the jury,  \"Did [the plaintiff] tell  you during\r\n\nyour interviews or during your clinical work on her case, did\r\n\nshe ever  mention to you that she  had multiple relationships\r                                                                         \r\n\nwith married men?\"3   The district court  properly noted that\r                            \r\n\nthis  question violated  its  ruling,  rebuked counsel  after\r\n\nfirst dismissing  the jury,  and fined him  $500.   The court\r\n\nlater instructed the jury that  counsel had violated a  court\r\n\norder  and  jurors  were to  disregard  the  question.   This\r\n\nresponse  was fully  justified, and  we find  no error.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nPolito, 856 F.2d at 418.  Inserni shall pay the costs  of his\r                  \r\n\nappeal to plaintiff.\r\n\n                    V.  Plaintiff's Appeal\r\n\n          Rodriguez appeals the district court's reduction of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  We  add, as the  district court understood,  that defense\r\ncounsel  knew from her deposition that the psychologist would\r\nanswer \"no\" to that question.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nher  attorney's  fees  and  costs  award  from  approximately\r\n\n$440,000 to $150,223.26.  As  noted above, the district court\r\n\njustified  this reduction on  several grounds: duplication of\r\n\neffort by  plaintiff's attorneys,  the use  of attorneys  for\r\n\n\"paralegal  work,\" and the plaintiff's lack  of success.  The\r\n\ncourt  uniformly cut the attorneys' requested hourly rates by\r\n\nfifteen  dollars, except  for Attorney  Berkan's out-of-court\r\n\nrate, which it cut by ten dollars.  The court reduced the fee\r\n\nrequest to $346,211.53, and then reduced this amount by sixty\r\n\npercent because of the plaintiff's \"lack of success.\"\r\n\n          Starting  with the  \"lodestar\"  calculation of  the\r\n\nhours  worked by each  attorney multiplied by  the attorney's\r\n\nhourly rate, the  court deducted time that  it determined was\r\n\nduplicative  or unnecessary.  The court  deducted 97 hours of\r\n\nattorney time because  it viewed the  time spent on  indexing\r\n\ndepositions as excessive, and agreed with defendants that the\r\n\nwork was  a \"paralegal task.\"   The court  noted a  number of\r\n\nentries on  plaintiff's counsels' time  sheets that suggested\r\n\nduplicative   efforts.    The  court  calculated  that  these\r\n\nduplicative  efforts  totaled  120 hours,  and  deducted this\r\n\namount.  Thirteen more hours were deducted for excessive time\r\n\nin preparing the attorney's fees petition.\r\n\n          The  court  determined that  it  was  excessive for\r\n\nthree  attorneys to  be present  at trial,  and  adjusted the\r\n\nhours so that  the time compensated amounted to  that of only\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\ntwo attorneys at any given time.  The court uniformly reduced\r\n\nthe  requested  hourly  rates  of  Rodriguez's  attorneys  by\r\n\nfifteen dollars,  except for  Attorney Berkan's  out-of-court\r\n\nhourly rate,  which it  reduced by ten  dollars.   Because it\r\n\ndetermined that the plaintiff enjoyed only limited success in\r\n\neach  of  her theories  of  recovery, the  court  reduced the\r\n\nlodestar figure by sixty percent of the total amount.\r\n\n          Fee awards are reviewed  deferentially, and will be\r\n\ndisturbed only for  mistake of  law or  abuse of  discretion.\r\n\nSee Coutin  v. Young  &amp; Rubicam Puerto  Rico, Inc.,  124 F.3d\r                                                              \r\n\n331, 336  (1st Cir. 1997);  Lipsett v. Blanco, 975  F.2d 934,\r                                                         \r\n\n936  (1st Cir. 1992)  (noting that \"because  determination of\r\n\nthe extent of a reasonable  fee necessarily involves a series\r\n\nof judgment calls,  an appellate court is far  more likely to\r\n\ndefer  to the trial court  in reviewing fee computations than\r\n\nin many  other situations.\").   Even  under this  deferential\r\n\nstandard, however,  we  conclude that  the  district  court's\r\n\nattorney's fees orders must be vacated.\r\n\nA.  Lack of Success\r                               \r\n\n          The district court  reduced the fee award  by sixty\r\n\npercent  for  \"lack  of success\"  because  Rodriguez  did not\r\n\nprevail on all of her claims and she did not receive the full\r\n\namount  of damages  she  sought.   According to  the district\r\n\ncourt,  the plaintiff \"ultimately  succeeded on her  claim of\r\n\nretaliation\" and  while the \"unsuccessful  claim, the  sexual\r\n\n                             -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nharassment  claim,  was  linked to  the  successful  claim of\r\n\nretaliation,  this fact alone does not preclude any reduction\r\n\nbased on the failure to establish sexual harassment.\"\r\n\n          The district court did not  explain how it had come\r\n\nto  the  conclusion  that the  jury  had  decided Rodriguez's\r\n\nclaims  in   this  way.     When  a  fee  award   is  reduced\r\n\nsubstantially, a more detailed explanation is in  order.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nBrewster v. Dukakis,  3 F.3d 488, 493 (1st Cir.  1993) (\"As a\r                               \r\n\ngeneral rule, a  fee-awarding court that makes  a substantial\r\n\nreduction  in either documented  time or  authenticated rates\r\n\nshould  offer reasonably explicit findings, for the court, in\r\n\nsuch circumstances, 'has  a burden to spell out  the whys and\r\n\nwherefores.'\") (quoting  United States v.  Metropolitan Dist.\r                                                                         \r\n\nComm'n, 847 F.2d 12, 18 (1st Cir. 1988)).   As our discussion\r                  \r\n\nin  part III.A above demonstrates,  the jury could have found\r\n\nthat  Rodriguez's  sex harassment  claims against  Chavez and\r\n\nOccidental  succeeded, on  either a  quid pro quo  or hostile\r\n\nenvironment theory.  \r\n\n          The district court  may have made the  same mistake\r\n\nthat  the defendants  have  made  in  arguing  that,  because\r\n\nMiranda was not  found liable, no \"sex  harassment\" occurred.\r\n\nAs  noted, this  conclusion  is not  mandated  by the  jury's\r\n\ngeneral verdict.   Neither did Rodriguez's sexual  harassment\r\n\nclaims  fail when  the district  court  dismissed her  claims\r\n\nunder  Title VII against  Chavez, as she  continued to pursue\r\n\n                             -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n\nsex  discrimination claims under Puerto Rico law.  Indeed, it\r\n\nappears Rodriguez has \"prevailed up and down the line\" on her\r\n\nclaims  against Chavez  and  Occidental,  in  which  case  \"a\r\n\nclaims-based,  results-obtained   fee  reduction   is  wholly\r\n\ninappropriate.\"  Coutin, 124 F.3d at 340.\r                                   \r\n\n          The  district  court's  reduction  of the  lodestar\r\n\nfigure  by  sixty  percent  of  the  total   because  of  the\r\n\nplaintiff's \"lack of success\"  was error.  Three measures  of\r\n\n\"success\" pertain to civil rights lawsuits  such as this one:\r\n\n\"plaintiff's success  claim  by  claim,  .  .  .  the  relief\r\n\nactually achieved, . . . [and] the societal importance of the\r\n\nright which has  been vindicated.\"  Coutin, 124  F.3d at 338.\r                                                      \r\n\nThe plaintiff  was clearly  successful under  the latter  two\r\n\ndefinitions.  \r\n\n          Rodriguez  received  a substantial  monetary  award\r\n\nconstituting full compensation  for her injuries, as  well as\r\n\npunitive damages.  The jury awarded Rodriguez all three types\r\n\nof  monetary compensation provided  for in the  verdict form:\r\n\ncompensation  for back pay and/or front pay and other related\r\n\njob benefits;  punitive damages; and compensatory damages for\r\n\nher emotional and/or mental suffering.\r\n\n          Congress  has encouraged  private suits  to counter\r\n\nsex  discrimination through the  award of attorney's  fees to\r\n\nsuccessful  litigants.  See City  of Riverside v. Rivera, 477\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 561, 574-75 (1986) (plurality opinion); Coutin, 124 F.3d\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -26-\r                                          26\r\r\n\nat  337.

Indeed, the close relationship\r                   \r\n\nbetween Occidental and PREPA, and between Chavez and Miranda,\r\n\nwas a foundational element  of her claims against Chavez  and\r\n\nOccidental, and would  have needed  to be  developed even  if\r\n\nplaintiff had not  sued Miranda or PREPA.  It  was this close\r\n\nrelationship  among   the  defendants   that  made   credible\r\n\nplaintiff's contentions that her boss asked her to respond to\r\n\nMiranda's  sexual advances  because  Miranda  and PREPA  were\r\n\nvalued customers,  and that he  fired her  when she  refused.\r\n\nSee id. at 440 (\"Where  a lawsuit consists of related claims,\r                   \r\n\na  plaintiff who has  won substantial relief  should not have\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nhis  attorney's fee reduced simply because the district court\r\n\ndid  not adopt each contention raised.\"); Scarfo v.

In the  \"gray areas,\"  such as\r\n\ndeciding  whether a  given task  is properly  entrusted  to a\r\n\nparalegal,  \"the   district  court's  judgment   carries  the\r\n\ngreatest weight.\"   Id. at 940.  Clerical tasks  ought not to\r                                   \r\n\nbe billed at lawyer's rates,  even if a lawyer performs them.\r\n\nSee id. \r                   \r\n\n          Time spent  by two  attorneys on  the same  general\r\n\ntask   is  not,  however,   per  se  duplicative.     Careful\r                                               \r\n\npreparation often  requires collaboration and  rehearsal, and\r\n\nthe court  should not  reward defendants  for their  vehement\r\n\n\"Stalingrad  defense,\" a tactic they have continued to employ\r\n\non  appeal.   Id.  at  939.    Indeed, because  a  litigant's\r                             \r\n\nstaffing  needs  and  preparation time  will  often  \"vary in\r\n\ndirect  proportion  to  the  ferocity  of  her   adversaries'\r\n\nhandling of  the  case, this  factor  weighs heavily  in  the\r\n\nbalance.\"  Id.   In this  case, the record  reveals that  the\r                          \r\n\ndefense was  indeed extreme.   As we  find that  the district\r\n\ncourt's   unexplained   reduction   for   lack   of   success\r\n\nindependently requires a remand, we consider the entire issue\r\n\nopen  for reconsideration  and need  not  decide whether  the\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nother  alleged errors  in calculating  attorney's fees  would\r\n\nalone prompt reversal.\r\n\n                       VI.  Conclusion\r\n\n          To conclude, we find any residuum of claimed errors\r\n\nto be without merit and unworthy of extended discussion.  The\r\n\njury verdict  is affirmed.   The award of attorney's  fees is\r                                     \r\n\nvacated,  and we  remand this  case for recalculation  of the\r                   \r\n\nattorney's fees award in accordance with this opinion.  Costs\r\n\nare awarded to Rodriguez.\r\n\n                             -30-\r                                          30\r\r\n",

Ct.\r                                                            \r\n\n70 (1997).\r\n\n          Rodriguez   worked   as  an   office   manager  for\r\n\nOccidental International, a Florida  company with offices  in\r\n\nFlorida  and  Puerto  Rico.   Rodriguez  started  working for\r\n\nOccidental  in  December of  1988 in  the Traffic  and Claims\r\n\ndivision of the Puerto Rico  office.  She was twice promoted,\r\n\nand was put  in charge of overseeing the  daily operations of\r\n\nher office in February of 1990.  While she was never formally\r\r\n\nevaluated during  her employment, Rodriguez  received regular\r\n\npraise for her work, and  before the suspension and dismissal\r\n\nthat led to this lawsuit,  she had never been the subject  of\r\n\ndisciplinary action.\r\n\n          Occidental  International   sells  electrical   and\r\n\nindustrial equipment.  Occidental's most important market was\r\n\nPuerto Rico, and its most  important customer was the  Puerto\r\n\nRico Electric  Power Authority  (\"PREPA\").   At  the time  of\r\n\nRodriguez's  dismissal,  approximately  80%  of  Occidental's\r\n\nbusiness in Puerto Rico was with PREPA.\r\n\n          Omar Chavez was the President and sole  shareholder\r\n\nof  Occidental.   Chavez  lived  in Florida,  and  would make\r\n\nmonthly  business trips  to Puerto  Rico.   Chavez pursued  a\r\n\nnumber  of strategies which he thought would ensure continued\r\n\ngood  relations   between  Occidental   and  its   customers,\r\n\nparticularly  with PREPA.  Evidence presented at trial showed\r\n\nthat Chavez primarily employed young, attractive women, known\r\n\nto customers as \"Occidental Gals,\" and  instructed them to be\r\n\nespecially cordial to PREPA employees.  \r\n\n          Good  relations  were particularly  important  with\r\n\nhigh-ranking PREPA  officials like  Edwin Miranda-Velez,  the\r\n\nChief  of  PREPA's  Materials  Management  Division  and  the\r\n\noverseer of  PREPA's public contracts  for the type  of goods\r\n\nsold  by Occidental.  Chavez introduced Rodriguez to Miranda,\r\n\nand told her that Miranda was very important for Occidental's\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nbusiness and that she and  the other employees should be nice\r\n\nto him and \"keep him satisfied.\"  She was instructed to visit\r\n\nMiranda every time she went to the PREPA offices.\r\n\n          Occidental  pursued  other  strategies.    It  made\r\n\npolitical contributions to  the Popular Democratic  Party, of\r\n\nwhich  Miranda  was  a  very  active  member,  and  solicited\r\n\ndonations on its  behalf.  Chavez financed  social activities\r\n\nfor  PREPA employees  and gave  Christmas  presents to  PREPA\r\n\nofficials.   In December  of 1990, Chavez  threw a  party for\r\n\nPREPA  officials  at a  local  hotel.    The members  of  the\r\n\nOccidental  Puerto Rico staff, all female, were instructed to\r\n\nattend the event unaccompanied, so they would be available to\r\n\ndance with the  PREPA executives.  The  night's entertainment\r\n\nat  that party included a dancing  show performed by scantily\r\n\nclad women.\r\n\n          The  close   relationship  with   PREPA  benefitted\r\n\nOccidental, and Chavez, in several  ways.  Chavez was able to\r\n\nlearn from  Miranda in advance  what bids would be  coming up\r\n\nand  how much Occidental's competitors were bidding.  Miranda\r\n\nhelped to steer  business to Occidental through  requests for\r\n\nproposals  that were  handled  outside  the ordinary  bidding\r\n\nprocess.   For example, Miranda helped Occidental to obtain a\r\n\ntransportation  contract  on an  \"emergency\" basis.   Miranda\r\n\nsigned all pertinent  documentation and recommended  payments\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nto suppliers.   There were also allegations that  Miranda was\r\n\nable to help Occidental avoid trouble over tax disclosures.\r\n\n          Miranda  began  to  make  unwelcome approaches  and\r\n\nsuggestive  comments to  Rodriguez.   He invited  her out  to\r\n\ndinner.  He  asked her to visit his office after hours and on\r\n\nFriday evenings.   He  anonymously sent  her flowers for  her\r\n\nbirthday  and included a  sexually explicit card.   Rodriguez\r\n\ncomplained to Chavez about this behavior; Chavez responded by\r\n\nstressing that Miranda  was an important client,  but assured\r\n\nher that he would deal with the problem.  \r\n\n          The culmination, as it were, of Miranda's  advances\r\n\ncame on February 28, 1992.  Miranda called Rodriguez and told\r\n\nher he  would  come pick  her  up to  take  her to  a  motel.\r\n\nRodriguez, upset  by Miranda's latest advance,  called Chavez\r\n\nto  complain about  Miranda's  call.    Chavez  responded  by\r\n\ndefending Miranda, and  saying that Rodriguez should  respond\r\n\nto Miranda  \"as a woman.\"   Rodriguez told Chavez  that if he\r\n\nwould  do  nothing about  the situation,  she would  take her\r\n\ncomplaints to the Director of PREPA.\r\n\n          That weekend, Chavez flew to Puerto Rico.  On March\r\n\n9, 1992, Chavez  gave Rodriguez a  letter informing her  that\r\n\nshe  was suspended  from work  for thirty  days.   The letter\r\n\nstated the reasons for her suspension as unauthorized  use of\r\n\ncompany property,  contracting  for services  in the  company\r\n\nname without  authorization, and  absenteeism.   On April  6,\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nRodriguez  received  a  second  letter  dismissing  her  from\r\n\nemployment at Occidental.  The grounds for her dismissal were\r\n\nan unexplained  imbalance of $157.00 in petty  cash funds and\r\n\nnegligence  in executing daily  functions such as  picking up\r\n\ncompany mail,  as well as the  problems noted in the  March 9\r\n\nletter.   Rodriguez  had  never been  notified  of  any  such\r\n\ndeficiencies before.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          In  September of 1992,  Rodriguez filed a complaint\r\n\nagainst Occidental  and Chavez  with the  Anti-Discrimination\r\n\nUnit  of the  Puerto Rico  Department of  Labor and  with the\r\n\nEqual  Employment  Opportunity  Commission.   In  November of\r\n\n1992, while that  complaint was before the  agency, Rodriguez\r\n\nsued Miranda  in district  court under 42  U.S.C.    1983 for\r\n\nviolations   of  her  rights  under  the  Fifth,  Ninth,  and\r\n\nFourteenth  Amendments, and sued both Miranda and PREPA under\r\n\nPuerto Rico tort law and the Puerto Rico Constitution.\r\n\n          After  exhausting   her  administrative   remedies,\r\n\nRodriguez received  a right-to-sue  letter from  the EEOC  in\r\n\nJune of  1993 and  amended her complaint  to name  Chavez and\r\n\nOccidental  as defendants.   The  amended complaint  asserted\r\n\nclaims under Title VII  of the Civil  Rights Act of 1964,  42\r\n\nU.S.C.    2000e-2000e-17, as well as claims under Puerto Rico\r\n\nlaw.  \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          In July of 1994, the district court issued an order\r\n\neliminating some of  Rodriguez's claims.  The  district court\r\n\ndismissed  the    1983 claim,  but  not the  Puerto Rico  law\r\n\nclaims, against  Miranda.  Thus  only Puerto Rico  law claims\r\n\nremained  against Miranda  and PREPA,  over  which the  court\r\n\nretained  jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.    1367.  The district\r\n\ncourt granted summary  judgment in favor of  defendant Chavez\r\n\non  Rodriguez's Title VII  claim against Chavez,  but allowed\r\n\nthe Puerto Rico law claims against Chavez to go to  the jury.\r\n\nThus the only federal claim that remained at the start of the\r\n\ntrial was Rodriguez's  Title VII claim against  her employer,\r\n\nOccidental.  The  only claims which went to  the jury against\r\n\nMiranda were based on commonwealth law.\r\n\n          The  trial   was  hotly  contested   and  extremely\r\n\ncontentious.  In the course  of the trial, the district court\r\n\nsanctioned  defense counsel for violating an order in limine.\r\n\nAfter a five week trial,  the jury held Occidental and Chavez\r\n\nliable  to  the plaintiff,  but found  Miranda and  PREPA not\r\n\nliable.   The jury form  simply asked that the  jurors answer\r\n\nyes or no as to whether each of the defendants was \"liable to\r\n\nplaintiff  Sandra Rodriguez.\"  Rodriguez received an award of\r\n\n$200,000  in   compensatory  and  punitive   damages  against\r\n\nOccidental  and Chavez.    The  jury answered  no  as to  the\r\n\ncommonwealth law claims against Miranda.\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          The  district  court awarded  Rodriguez  attorney's\r\n\nfees.    But  in  the   face  of  a  documented  request  for\r\n\napproximately $440,000 in  fees and costs, the  court awarded\r\n\nonly $150,223.26.  The district court disallowed some work as\r\n\nduplicative,  some as having been performed by attorneys when\r\n\nthe court thought it should have been done by paralegals, and\r\n\nfurther reduced the award because of the plaintiff's \"lack of\r\n\nsuccess.\"\r\n\n          Occidental and Chavez appeal from  the jury verdict\r\n\nin cases  number  96-1416 and  97-1444,  alleging a  host  of\r\n\nerrors and  demanding a new  trial.  Defense  counsel Inserni\r\n\nappeals in case number 95-2027 from the contempt order issued\r\n\nagainst  him during the  trial.  Plaintiff  cross-appeals, in\r\n\ncase  number 97-1445, arguing that the district court's award\r\n\nof attorney's fees was in error and insufficient.\r\n\n            III.  Appeal of Occidental and Chavez\r\n\nA.  Jury Inconsistency Argument\r                                           \r\n\n          Occidental and  Chavez's flagship  argument, simply\r\n\nput, is that because the jury did not find either  Miranda or\r\n\nPREPA  liable to Rodriguez,  Chavez and Occidental  cannot be\r\n\nheld liable either.  Rodriguez  could not have been dismissed\r\n\nfor refusing  to submit to  (or threatening  to complain  of)\r\n\nMiranda's  advances,  defendants  argue,   because  the  jury\r\n\nverdict  shows that Miranda  never engaged in  the conduct of\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nwhich she  complains.   This  argument  is founded  upon  the\r\n\nerroneous assumption that the jury's verdict that Miranda and\r\n\nPREPA are not \"liable to plaintiff\" under Puerto Rico tort or\r\n\nconstitutional  law necessarily means  that the jury  did not\r\n\nbelieve  that  Miranda made  unwanted  sexual advances,  that\r\n\nRodriguez complained of these advances, and that her employer\r\n\nfired her in response.\r\n\n          The defendants'  argument fails, as the  jury could\r\n\nquite plausibly have  found a set of facts  that would render\r\n\nChavez  and Occidental, but not Miranda and PREPA, \"liable to\r\n\nplaintiff\" on the claims asserted.\r\n\n          In  order to evaluate the defendants' arguments, it\r\n\nis important to  understand the nature of  the claims brought\r\n\nagainst each of the four  defendants in this case.  Rodriguez\r\n\nsued  the  customer, Miranda  and  PREPA on  two  theories --\r\n\nliability  under  Puerto  Rico  tort  law  and  violation  of\r\n\nRodriguez's  rights to \"privacy and dignity\" under the Puerto\r\n\nRico Constitution.   The jury  was instructed  that, to  find\r\n\nMiranda liable to the plaintiff in negligence, it had to find\r\n\n\"that there was  an act or omission, by  fault or negligence,\r\n\nthat caused the plaintiff's injury.\"  See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\r                                                     \r\n\n31,   5141  (1991) (\"A person who  by act or omission  causes\r\n\ndamage  to another  through  fault  or  negligence  shall  be\r\n\nobliged to repair  the damage so done.

Const. art. II,   1 (\"The dignity of the human being\r               \r\n\nis  inviolable. .  . .  No  discrimination shall  be made  on\r\n\naccount of .  . . sex  . . .  .\"); P.R. Const.  art. II,    8\r\n\n(\"Every person has the right to the protection of law against\r\n\nabusive  attacks  on  his honor,  reputation  and  private or\r\n\nfamily life.\").  \r\n\n          If  Miranda was not liable to Rodriguez under these\r\n\ntwo  theories,  then  PREPA  could  not  be  found liable  to\r\n\nRodriguez either.   PREPA's liability was only  in respondeat\r\n\nsuperior for the actions of Miranda.\r\n\n          Both of the claims as described to the jury contain\r\n\nan element  of causation.   The jury may simply  have decided\r\n\nthat  Rodriguez's   injuries  resulted  not   from  Miranda's\r\n\nactions, but from  those of Chavez and Occidental.   Thus the\r\n\njury may have  declined to hold  Miranda liable, not  because\r\n\nthe jurors did not believe  that he made sexual advances, but\r\n\nrather  because they  concluded that  this  behavior did  not\r\n\nitself cause the harms Rodriguez suffered.\r\n\n                             -10-\r                                          10\r\r\n\n          In contrast, the  plaintiff asserted four different\r\n\ntheories of liability  against Chavez under Puerto  Rico law,\r\n\nnone of which is inconsistent with the jury's refusal to hold\r\n\nMiranda  and PREPA  liable.    In addition  to  the tort  and\r\n\nconstitutional claims described above, Rodriguez sued  Chavez\r\n\nfor  sex discrimination  and retaliatory  discharge.   Puerto\r\n\nRico's Law 100  forbids sex discrimination by  employers, and\r\n\nprovides for civil liability and damages.  See P.R. Laws Ann.\r                                                          \r\n\ntit.  29,    146 (1995).   Puerto Rico's  Law 17  defines sex\r\n\nharassment  as  a  type of  sex  discrimination,  and forbids\r\n\nretaliation  against  persons  who  \"reject\"  the  employer's\r\n\nsexually discriminatory practices.   See P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.\r                                                    \r\n\n29,    155-155l  (1995).  Under Puerto Rico  law, an employer\r\n\nis  held responsible  for  \"the  acts  of  sexual  harassment\r\n\ntowards his  employees  in  the work  place  by  persons  not\r\n\nemployed by him if the  employer or his agents or supervisors\r\n\nknew or  should have known  of such conduct and  did not take\r\n\nimmediate  and adequate  action  to correct  the  situation.\"\r\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29,   155f.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff  also  sought  separation  pay  from\r\n\nChavez  and Occidental for unjust dismissal under Puerto Rico\r\n\nLaw 80.   See P.R. Laws Ann.  tit. 29,   185a  (1995) (\"Every\r                         \r\n\nemployee  in  commerce .  .  .  who  is discharged  from  his\r\n\nemployment without good  cause, shall be entitled  to receive\r\n\nfrom  his employer,  in addition  to the  salary he  may have\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nearned:  (a)  The  salary  corresponding  to  one  month,  as\r\n\nindemnity; (b) An additional progressive indemnity equivalent\r\n\nto  one  week for  each  year  of  service.\").   Further,  in\r\n\naddition to the same four  causes of action under Puerto Rico\r\n\nlaw  asserted against  Chavez, Rodriguez sued  Occidental for\r\n\nsex discrimination under Title VII.\r\n\n          We  cannot, based on the jury form, determine which\r\n\nof   Rodriguez's  claims   against   Chavez  and   Occidental\r\n\nsucceeded.  The jury was asked only to answer yes or no as to\r\n\nwhether  each  defendant  was  \"liable  to  plaintiff  Sandra\r\n\nRodriguez.\"   The jury  could have  properly decided  to hold\r\n\nChavez  and  Occidental  liable  because  they  discriminated\r\n\nagainst Rodriguez  on the basis  of her sex, or  because they\r\n\nretaliated  against her  for her  complaints about  Miranda's\r\n\nbehavior.  \r\n\n          Sexual  harassment  is  an  unlawful  form  of  sex\r\n\ndiscrimination,  and both Chavez and Occidental could be held\r\n\nliable for sex  harassment on either of two  theories -- quid\r\n\npro quo or hostile work environment.  \r\n\n          Under  the   quid  pro   quo  theory,   Rodriguez's\r\n\ncontinued  employment  was  conditioned  on  coerced  sex,  a\r\n\ncondition that was  inherently linked to her  gender.  Puerto\r\n\nRico  law, see  P.R. Laws  Ann.  tit. 29,    155f,  and other\r                          \r\n\ncircuits,  interpreting Title VII,  have said  that employers\r\n\ncan be liable for a  customer's unwanted sexual advances,  if\r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nthe  employer  ratifies  or   acquiesces  in  the  customer's\r\n\ndemands.

This  is a  case in  which\r\n\nRodriguez's employer  not only acquiesced  in the  customer's\r\n\ndemands, but explicitly told her  to give in to those demands\r\n\nand satisfy the customer.  This conduct is clearly an example\r\n\nof  quid pro quo  sexual harassment, as  Rodriguez's employer\r\n\nconditioned her  future with the company on her responding to\r\n\nthe unwanted sexual demands of a customer.\r\n\n          Under  the hostile work  environment theory  of sex\r\n\ndiscrimination,  the jury  could  have reasonably  found that\r\n\nChavez and Occidental  had established a  working environment\r\n\nhostile to women.   The jury was instructed  that this theory\r\n\nof  sex discrimination  \"involves  forms of  sexually-related\r\n\nmisconduct which  are severe  and pervasive  and unreasonably\r\n\ninterfere  with  work   performance  or  create  a   hostile,\r\n\nintimidating  or  offensive  working  environment.    It  can\r\n\ninclude  demeaning  comments  or  expectations  of  a certain\r\n\nsexual behavior in the workplace.\"  This environment would be\r\n\na product not  only of Chavez's refusal to  do anything about\r\n\nMiranda's advances, but  also of incidents  such as the  1990\r\n\nChristmas party.\r\n\n          Likewise, the success  of a retaliation claim  does\r\n\nnot  require  that  the alleged  wrongful  conduct  itself be\r\n\nillegal.   For her  retaliation claim  to succeed,  Rodriguez\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nmerely needed to show that she \"reasonably believed\" that the\r\n\nconduct of  which she  complained or  threatened to  complain\r\n\nviolated Title VII.

Rule  412 thus\r\n\nreverses the usual  approach of the Federal Rules of Evidence\r\n\non admissibility  by requiring that the  evidence's probative\r\n\nvalue \"substantially outweigh\" its prejudicial effect.  \r\n\n          Rule  412  mandates procedural  safeguards  for the\r\n\nintroduction of such evidence under the  412(b)(2) exception.\r\n\nA party intending  to offer such evidence must  file a motion\r\n\nspecifically describing the evidence and its purpose at least\r\n\nfourteen days before trial, serve  the motion on all parties,\r\n\nand notify the alleged victim.  Before admitting the evidence\r\n\nthe court  must conduct  an in camera  hearing to  afford the\r\n\nvictim and parties  a right to be  heard.  See Fed.  R. Evid.\r                                                          \r\n\n412(c).\r\n\n          The district court  ruled that evidence  concerning\r\n\nplaintiff's  moral character  or promiscuity and  the marital\r\n\nstatus of her boyfriend was inadmissible under Rule 412.  But\r\n\nthe court  allowed defendants to introduce  evidence directly\r\n\nrelevant  to  their   theory  that  plaintiff's  relationship\r\n\ndistracted her from work.   The court also held that evidence\r\n\nconcerning plaintiff's allegedly  flirtatious behavior toward\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nMiranda  was   admissible  to  determine   whether  Miranda's\r\n\nadvances were in fact \"unwanted.\"\r\n\n          These  evidentiary  rulings  were  well within  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's discretion.  The court struck an acceptable\r\n\nbalance between the danger of undue prejudice and the need to\r\n\npresent  the  jury  with relevant  evidence,  particularly in\r\n\nlight of Rule 412's special standard of admissibility.\r\n\n2.  Rulings under Rule 403\r                                      \r\n\n          Nor  is  there  any  abuse  of  discretion  in  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's other evidentiary  rulings.  Under  Fed. R.\r\n\nEvid.  402,  all  relevant  evidence  is  admissible   unless\r\n\notherwise provided  by federal law.   See Fed. R.  Evid. 402.\r                                                     \r\n\nUnder Fed. R. Evid. 403, relevant evidence may be excluded if\r\n\nits  probative value  is  \"substantially  outweighed\" by  the\r\n\ndanger of prejudice or confusion.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403.  \r                                                  \r\n\n          Defendants  challenge  the   exclusion  of  certain\r\n\ntelephone  records, rebuttal evidence  by some of plaintiff's\r\n\nco-workers, and an answering machine tape.  We agree with the\r\n\ndistrict court  that the  testimony and  phone records  would\r\n\nhave been, at best, cumulative.  The district court conducted\r\n\nlengthy proceedings  over the  admissibility of  an answering\r\n\nmachine tape  produced by  Chavez that  purportedly contained\r\n\nseveral  messages from Rodriguez  to Chavez that  could imply\r\n\nthat they had been intimate.   The defendants argue that this\r\n\npiece  of evidence would  have shown that  \"plaintiff treated\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nChavez  affectionately and could not have been complaining of\r\n\nsexual harassment.\"  An FBI analysis of the voice on the tape\r\n\nwas  inconclusive.    The  court  ruled  that  the  tape  was\r\n\ninadmissible under Fed. R. Evid.  403, and we agree that this\r\n\ndubious evidence had  minimal probative value, and  had great\r\n\npotential to confuse the jury.\r\n\n          Defendants complain of  a \"double standard\" because\r\n\nthe  district   court  allowed   information  introduced   by\r\n\nplaintiff while excluding  evidence introduced by  defendant.\r\n\nThe  court allowed evidence concerning the close ties between\r\n\nOccidental  and   PREPA,  including  evidence   of  political\r\n\ndonations, Occidental's tax  status, the dancing show  at the\r\n\n1990  Christmas party,  and a  letter  regarding Occidental's\r\n\nsales volume.  In fact, as to the  excluded evidence, Fed. R.\r\n\nEvid. 412  required the  district court  to apply a  stricter\r                               \r\n\nstandard  with regard to admission of evidence of plaintiff's\r\n\nsexual history than to  the evidence admitted under the  more\r\n\nliberal standard of Fed. R.  Evid. 402 &amp; 403.   This evidence\r\n\nwas  directly relevant to  the theory of  Rodriguez's case --\r\n\nthat Chavez and Occidental were  willing to fire her when she\r\n\ncomplained about  Miranda in  order to  maintain their  close\r\n\nrelationship with Miranda and PREPA.\r\n\n          Having  examined  each  of  the  district   court's\r\n\nevidentiary rulings, we find none that represents an abuse of\r\n\nits discretion.  Even if  the court's exclusions were  error,\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nnone of the excluded evidence would have had an impact on the\r\n\noutcome  of  the  trial,  as  it  would  have  at  best  been\r\n\nduplicative of evidence that was admitted.\r\n\nD.  Claims of Judicial Bias\r                                       \r\n\n          Occidental and Chavez argue that the district court\r\n\njudge's  admonitions to  defense counsel  evince bias,  which\r\n\ntainted  the jury  verdict.   They claim  that this  bias was\r\n\nfurther  demonstrated  by  the  judge's  rulings  on  defense\r\n\ncounsel's peremptory  challenges, exclusion of  evidence, and\r\n\nhis sanctioning defense counsel for violating an  evidentiary\r\n\nruling under  Fed. R. Evid.  412.  The contested  rulings are\r\n\ndiscussed elsewhere, and they were  entirely proper.  Most of\r\n\nthe comments  appellants complain  of were  made outside  the\r\n\nhearing of the jury.  \r\n\n          At the  very latest,  this claim  should have  been\r\n\nraised  in defendants'  Rule 50  motion  before the  district\r\n\ncourt.   It is  therefore waived.

The court\r\n\nlater instructed the jury that  counsel had violated a  court\r\n\norder  and  jurors  were to  disregard  the  question.   This\r\n\nresponse  was fully  justified, and  we find  no error.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nPolito, 856 F.2d at 418.

Plaintiff's Appeal\r\n\n          Rodriguez appeals the district court's reduction of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  We  add, as the  district court understood,  that defense\r\ncounsel  knew from her deposition that the psychologist would\r\nanswer \"no\" to that question.\r\n\n                             -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\nher  attorney's  fees  and  costs  award  from  approximately\r\n\n$440,000 to $150,223.26.  As  noted above, the district court\r\n\njustified  this reduction on  several grounds: duplication of\r\n\neffort by  plaintiff's attorneys,  the use  of attorneys  for\r\n\n\"paralegal  work,\" and the plaintiff's lack  of success.  The\r\n\ncourt  uniformly cut the attorneys' requested hourly rates by\r\n\nfifteen  dollars, except  for Attorney  Berkan's out-of-court\r\n\nrate, which it cut by ten dollars.  The court reduced the fee\r\n\nrequest to $346,211.53, and then reduced this amount by sixty\r\n\npercent because of the plaintiff's \"lack of success.\"\r\n\n          Starting  with the  \"lodestar\"  calculation of  the\r\n\nhours  worked by each  attorney multiplied by  the attorney's\r\n\nhourly rate, the  court deducted time that  it determined was\r\n\nduplicative  or unnecessary.  The court  deducted 97 hours of\r\n\nattorney time because  it viewed the  time spent on  indexing\r\n\ndepositions as excessive, and agreed with defendants that the\r\n\nwork was  a \"paralegal task.\"   The court  noted a  number of\r\n\nentries on  plaintiff's counsels' time  sheets that suggested\r\n\nduplicative   efforts.    The  court  calculated  that  these\r\n\nduplicative  efforts  totaled  120 hours,  and  deducted this\r\n\namount.  Thirteen more hours were deducted for excessive time\r\n\nin preparing the attorney's fees petition.\r\n\n          The  court  determined that  it  was  excessive for\r\n\nthree  attorneys to  be present  at trial,  and  adjusted the\r\n\nhours so that  the time compensated amounted to  that of only\r\n\n                             -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\ntwo attorneys at any given time.  The court uniformly reduced\r\n\nthe  requested  hourly  rates  of  Rodriguez's  attorneys  by\r\n\nfifteen dollars,  except for  Attorney Berkan's  out-of-court\r\n\nhourly rate,  which it  reduced by ten  dollars.   Because it\r\n\ndetermined that the plaintiff enjoyed only limited success in\r\n\neach  of  her theories  of  recovery, the  court  reduced the\r\n\nlodestar figure by sixty percent of the total amount.\r\n\n          Fee awards are reviewed  deferentially, and will be\r\n\ndisturbed only for  mistake of  law or  abuse of  discretion.\r\n\nSee Coutin  v.

Indeed, it\r\n\nappears Rodriguez has \"prevailed up and down the line\" on her\r\n\nclaims  against Chavez  and  Occidental,  in  which  case  \"a\r\n\nclaims-based,  results-obtained   fee  reduction   is  wholly\r\n\ninappropriate.\"  Coutin, 124 F.3d at 340.\r                                   \r\n\n          The  district  court's  reduction  of the  lodestar\r\n\nfigure  by  sixty  percent  of  the  total   because  of  the\r\n\nplaintiff's \"lack of success\"  was error.  Three measures  of\r\n\n\"success\" pertain to civil rights lawsuits  such as this one:\r\n\n\"plaintiff's success  claim  by  claim,  .  .  .  the  relief\r\n\nactually achieved, . . . [and] the societal importance of the\r\n\nright which has  been vindicated.\"  Coutin, 124  F.3d at 338.\r                                                      \r\n\nThe plaintiff  was clearly  successful under  the latter  two\r\n\ndefinitions.  \r\n\n          Rodriguez  received  a substantial  monetary  award\r\n\nconstituting full compensation  for her injuries, as  well as\r\n\npunitive damages.  The jury awarded Rodriguez all three types\r\n\nof  monetary compensation provided  for in the  verdict form:\r\n\ncompensation  for back pay and/or front pay and other related\r\n\njob benefits;  punitive damages; and compensatory damages for\r\n\nher emotional and/or mental suffering.\r\n\n          Congress  has encouraged  private suits  to counter\r\n\nsex  discrimination through the  award of attorney's  fees to\r\n\nsuccessful  litigants.

Indeed, the close relationship\r                   \r\n\nbetween Occidental and PREPA, and between Chavez and Miranda,\r\n\nwas a foundational element  of her claims against Chavez  and\r\n\nOccidental, and would  have needed  to be  developed even  if\r\n\nplaintiff had not  sued Miranda or PREPA.  It  was this close\r\n\nrelationship  among   the  defendants   that  made   credible\r\n\nplaintiff's contentions that her boss asked her to respond to\r\n\nMiranda's  sexual advances  because  Miranda  and PREPA  were\r\n\nvalued customers,  and that he  fired her  when she  refused.\r\n\nSee id. at 440 (\"Where  a lawsuit consists of related claims,\r                   \r\n\na  plaintiff who has  won substantial relief  should not have\r\n\n                             -27-\r                                          27\r\r\n\nhis  attorney's fee reduced simply because the district court\r\n\ndid  not adopt each contention raised.\"); Scarfo v.

Thus,  because  the district  court  failed to\r\n\narticulate its reasons for finding \"lack of  success,\" and no\r\n\nsound reasons are apparent in  the record, we must vacate its\r\n\norder and remand for reconsideration.\r\n\nB.

(quoting  Wagenmann v.

In the  \"gray areas,\"  such as\r\n\ndeciding  whether a  given task  is properly  entrusted  to a\r\n\nparalegal,  \"the   district  court's  judgment   carries  the\r\n\ngreatest weight.\"   Id. at 940.  Clerical tasks  ought not to\r                                   \r\n\nbe billed at lawyer's rates,  even if a lawyer performs them.\r\n\nSee id. \r                   \r\n\n          Time spent  by two  attorneys on  the same  general\r\n\ntask   is  not,  however,   per  se  duplicative.

Id.  at  939.    Indeed, because  a  litigant's\r                             \r\n\nstaffing  needs  and  preparation time  will  often  \"vary in\r\n\ndirect  proportion  to  the  ferocity  of  her   adversaries'\r\n\nhandling of  the  case, this  factor  weighs heavily  in  the\r\n\nbalance.\"  Id.   In this  case, the record  reveals that  the\r                          \r\n\ndefense was  indeed extreme.   As we  find that  the district\r\n\ncourt's   unexplained   reduction   for   lack   of   success\r\n\nindependently requires a remand, we consider the entire issue\r\n\nopen  for reconsideration  and need  not  decide whether  the\r\n\n                             -29-\r                                          29\r\r\n\nother  alleged errors  in calculating  attorney's fees  would\r\n\nalone prompt reversal.\r\n\n                       VI.  Conclusion\r\n\n          To conclude, we find any residuum of claimed errors\r\n\nto be without merit and unworthy of extended discussion.  The\r\n\njury verdict  is affirmed.   The award of attorney's  fees is\r                                     \r\n\nvacated,  and we  remand this  case for recalculation  of the\r                   \r\n\nattorney's fees award in accordance with this opinion.
