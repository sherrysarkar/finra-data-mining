Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                  \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                     Selya, Cyr and Lynch,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nCarlos Ferrer-Cruz on brief pro se.\r                              \r\nGuillermo Gil, United  States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco  and\r                                                                         \r\nNelson  Perez-Sosa, Assistant  United States  Attorneys, on  brief for\r                          \r\nappellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n     Per Curiam.   Following  his  conviction for  possession\r                           \r\r\n\nwith intent to  distribute cocaine, appellant Carlos  Ferrer-\r\n\nCruz filed  a motion under 28  U.S.C.   2255  seeking to have\r\n\nhis sentence vacated, set aside, or corrected.  The    motion\r\n\nwas assigned  to the  district  judge who  presided over  the\r\n\ntrial and sentencing  hearing.   See Rule 4(a)  of the  Rules\r                                                \r\n\nGoverning    2255 Proceedings.  Since  the sentencing hearing\r\n\nhad  never been  transcribed and  the court  reporter's notes\r\n\nwere  lost, appellant was  ordered to provide  a statement of\r\n\nhis  recollection of  the proceedings.   The motion  was then\r\n\nreferred to a magistrate,  who recommended that it  be denied\r\n\nand  dismissed.    Thereafter,  for  reasons  which  are  not\r\n\nentirely  clear based  on the  record, the  instant case  was\r\n\nadministratively  transferred  to   another  district   judge\r\n\n(hereinafter:   motion judge).   Appellant did not  object to\r\n\nthe  transfer.   After  a de  novo  review, the  motion judge\r                                              \r\n\nadopted  the  magistrate's   recommendation.    This   appeal\r\n\nfollowed.\r\n\n     Appellant's  sole argument  is that  it was error  for a\r\n\njudge  other than the sentencing judge to  rule on his   2255\r\n\nmotion.  This argument is waived since it was never presented\r\n\nto  the district court.  See, e.g., Carreiro v. Rhodes Gill &amp;\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo.,  68 F.3d 1443, 1449  (1st Cir. 1995);  Clauson v. Smith,\r                                                                        \r\n\n823  F.2d 660, 666 (1st Cir. 1987).  Similarly, appellant has\r\n\nabandoned any arguments on the merits of the issues raised in\r\n\nhis   2255 motion since he has failed to argue  the merits in\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nhis appellate brief.   See,  e.g., Willhauck  v. Halpin,  953\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 689, 700 (1st Cir. 1991).  \r\n\n     We  add simply  that we  are persuaded  that the  motion\r\n\njudge -- who  had the  benefit of the  trial transcript,  the\r\n\nPSR, and the  judgment -- was fully  in a position  to decide\r\n\nthe issues  raised in the  motion.   Contrary to  appellant's\r\n\nsuggestion, the motion judge  was in a position to  make, and\r\n\ndid make, an  independent assessment  of whether  appellant's\r\n\nsentence would likely have  been different if defense counsel\r\n\nhad  acted  differently.    Assuming  without  deciding  that\r\n\nappellant's  claims  premised  on  inadequate  opportunity to\r\n\nreview  the PSR  and failure  of the  court to  make findings\r\n\nregarding his  financial condition  are cognizable in    2255\r\n\nproceedings,  they are  arguably  procedurally  barred.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nKnight v. United  States, 37  F.3d 769, 774  (1st Cir.  1994)\r                                    \r\n\n(explaining cause and prejudice  requirement).  In any event,\r\n\nappellant failed to show  that he was prejudiced by  the lack\r\n\nof  an adequate  opportunity  to personally  review the  PSR.\r\n\nMoreover,  the PSR  thoroughly details  appellant's financial\r\n\ncondition, and the court's consideration of this condition is\r\n\nevinced by the fact  that it chose a fine  within appellant's\r\n\nthen ability  to pay and at  the lower end of  the applicable\r\n\nrange.  Cf.  United States  v. Wilfred Am.  Educ. Corp.,  953\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d 717,  719-20 (1st Cir.  1992) (reviewing court  will not\r\n\npresume  that sentencing  court ignored relevant  evidence in\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nthe  record).   Under the  circumstances, we  do not  think a\r\n\nsentencing  transcript was essential  to evaluate appellant's\r\n\nclaims.  \r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
