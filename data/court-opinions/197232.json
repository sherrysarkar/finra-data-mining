Pursuant  to a written plea agreement,\r                                \r\n\ndefendant pled guilty  to being  a felon in  possession of  a\r\n\nfirearm in violation of 18 U.S.C.    922(g)(1).   In exchange\r\n\nfor the plea, the government moved to withdraw an information\r\n\ncharging prior offenses under  the Armed Career Criminal Act,\r\n\n18 U.S.C.   924(e)(1)  (effectively recommending that the Act\r\n\nnot  be  applied);  offered  no opposition  to  a  sentencing\r\n\ndecrease  for defendant's  acceptance of  responsibility; and\r\n\nrecommended  a sentence  at  the low  end  of the  applicable\r\n\nrange.  The court accepted the recommendation as to the Armed\r\n\nCareer  Criminal Act,  and decreased defendant's  range three\r\n\nlevels for acceptance of  responsibility.  However, the court\r\n\nalso  increased  the  range  by  four  levels  under  USSG   \r\n\n2K2.1(b)(5),  and sentenced defendant  (within the applicable\r\n\nrange) to 120 months  imprisonment, the statutory maximum for\r\n\nthe offense.  \r\n\n          Defendant  now  appeals  from  the  sentence.
