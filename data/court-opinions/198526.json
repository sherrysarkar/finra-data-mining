Bond and The Kaplan/Bond\r\nGroup were on brief, for appellant.\r\nRobert E. Collins, with whom Thomas E. Clinton and Clinton &amp;\r\nMuzyka, P.C. were on brief, for appellee.\r\n\n                                  \r\n\n                 June 16, 1999\r\n                                           JOHN R. GIBSON, Senior Circuit Judge.  James P. Halpin\r\nappeals from an adverse judgment in his suit for personal injuries\r\nbrought under 33 U.S.C.  905(b) (1994).  He was employed by\r\nAtkinson-Kiewit and was seriously injured when a crane hook,\r\nreleased by one of his co-workers, struck his face.  This occurred\r\nwhen a supply vessel, the M/V Narragansett Eagle, owned by\r\nAtkinson, caused a barge to move away from a pier, resulting in one\r\nend of a gangway falling into the water.  Halpin argues that the\r\nmagistrate judge erred in finding no negligence on the part of\r\nTitus, the captain of the Eagle, and applied an erroneous standard\r\nof care in determining Halpin's comparative negligence.  We\r\nconclude the finding that Titus was not negligent is not clearly\r\nerroneous, and we need not reach the issue concerning Halpin's\r\nconduct.\r\n                       I.\r\nHalpin was a pile driver foreman and was working on the\r\nJamestown Bridge Project in Rhode Island.  On June 13, he, Mark\r\nNealand, and another coworker were securing twenty-five ton granite\r\npanels to a pier using angle irons.  While the crew was inside the\r\npier, Titus was attempting to deliver grout to a supply barge\r\nfloating parallel to the pier about 40 feet away from it.  Titus\r\napproached the barge from the windward side, rather than the\r\nleeward side.  The Eagle pushed the supply barge and the Barge 852\r\nadjacent to it away from the pier, which caused one end of the\r\ngangway connecting the pier and the supply barge to drop into the\r\nwater.  At some point, the stern of the Eagle came in contact with\r\nthe pier.\r\nThe gangway was the only means by which the crew could\r\nleave the pier, and when Halpin saw the gangway fall, he feared for\r\nthe safety of the crew.  His crew was in a position where a\r\ncollapse of the pier's panels caused by the contact of the vessel\r\ncould pose an extreme danger.  At Halpin's direction, one of the\r\nmen on the crew attached the eye of a spreader hook (a steel cable\r\nwith an eye in the middle and hooks on each side) to the top of a\r\ncrane's headache ball hook.  The crane operator then moved the\r\nheadache ball, spreader, and choke to Halpin on the pier.  Halpin\r\ngave one hook to Nealand, who was standing on the pier.  Halpin\r\ntook the choke and the other hook, and, using another piece of the\r\nsteel eye, made a loop in which he could put his foot.  He held\r\nonto the crane's headache ball with both hands, and several\r\nattempts were made to lower Halpin to an area where the gangway was\r\nin the water.  The attempts were unsuccessful, and Halpin gave a\r\nsignal to lift him to the deck of the barge.  While the crane\r\noperator raised Halpin, the other spreader hook, held by Nealand,\r\nwas pulled out of his grasp.  The hook struck Halpin on the side of\r\nhis face causing serious injuries.\r\nHalpin sued Atkinson under 33 U.S.C.  905(b), alleging\r\nthat the negligent operation of the Eagle caused his injuries.  At\r\ntrial, the parties presented evidence as to Titus's negligence.\r\nHalpin presented evidence of 35-40 knot per hour winds, rough sea\r\nconditions, and the testimony of Joe Voccola, another captain on\r\nthe project, and other employees who stated that approaching from\r\nthe leeward side was customary or that Titus should have approached\r\nfrom the leeward side.  Atkinson presented evidence that the wind\r\nconditions were only 10 knots per hour and that the sea was not\r\nparticularly rough.  Further, Titus testified that he chose to\r\napproach from the windward side because it offered better\r\nvisibility and more protective rubber tires and because it provided\r\neasier access to the area where grout was stored.   \r\nThe magistrate judge made three findings of disputed\r\nfact.  First, even though the Eagle once made contact with the\r\npier, the contact had ended by the time the gangway fell in the\r\nwater.  Thus, there was no danger of panel collapse and no\r\nemergency at the time Halpin took his actions, and Halpin's actions\r\nwere unjustified.  Secondly, Titus's actions were not negligent. \r\nThirdly, the gangway could have been replaced without Halpin riding\r\nthe crane ball.  Halpin argues that the magistrate judge's finding\r\nthat Titus was not negligent was clearly erroneous and that his\r\nfailure to apply a wanton or reckless standard in evaluating\r\nHalpin's comparative negligence was error.  We affirm.                               II.\r\nIf Titus was not negligent, Halpin cannot recover.  We\r\nreview the magistrate judge's finding that Titus was not negligent\r\nfor clear error, see Sierra Fria Corp. v. Donald J. Evans, P.C.,\r\n127 F.3d 175, 181 (1st Cir. 1997), which exists when we have a\r\ndefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. \r\nSee Strahan v. Coxe, 127 F.3d 155, 172 (1st Cir. 1997), cert.\r\ndenied, 119 S. Ct. 81 (1998).  We cannot conclude the magistrate\r\njudge's finding was clearly erroneous.\r\nHalpin claims that Titus's decision to use the windward\r\nside, rather than the leeward, was negligent.  As he puts it,\r\n\"Titus chose the more dangerous route, for no apparent good reason. \r\nThis is strong evidence of negligence.\"  His strongest support for\r\nthe argument that Titus's choice was unreasonable was the testimony\r\nof Voccola, another captain who worked at the bridge project.  When\r\nasked what the custom was for handling vessels at the project,\r\nVoccola stated, \"You would try to get it on the leeward side.  It\r\nwould be easier for you.\"  Voccola also testified that when picking\r\nup people, he would have used the leeward side.\r\nWe reject Halpin's argument.  Titus offered\r\njustifications for his choice.  Titus's testimony showed that he\r\napproached from the windward side, rather than the leeward, because\r\nthat approach offered more visibility and more protective rubber\r\ntires and provided easier access to the area where grout was\r\nstored.\r\nThe evidence of wind conditions was not as compelling as\r\nHalpin asserts.  There was testimony that the wind was 35-40 knots\r\nper hour at 1:00 P.M., the time of the accident.  However, the\r\nofficial records of the Castle Hill Station of the National Oceanic\r\nand Atmospheric Administration, located five miles from the scene,\r\nregistered the wind at 10 knots per hour at both 11:00 A.M. and\r\n2:00 P.M.  Jack Harper, pile driving superintendent at the bridge\r\nproject, testified that it was \"breezy but nothing . . .\r\nremarkable\" and that even if the winds were at 35-40 knots per\r\nhour, the sea would not be particularly rough.\r\nFinally, the testimony of Voccola does not convince us\r\nthat the magistrate judge clearly erred.  While the magistrate\r\njudge made contrary statements as to whether expert testimony was\r\nrequired in the case, he ultimately held that he \"need not decide,\r\nwhether or not, as a matter of law, [Halpin] needed to call an\r\nexpert witness . . . .\" and that he was \"unable to give the weight\r\nto the evidence presented\" which Halpin sought to have him give it. \r\nThe testimony was conflicting, and for the magistrate judge to\r\nassess, including the value of Voccola's testimony.  Halpin has\r\noffered no compelling argument that the magistrate judge clearly\r\nerred.  In this case, although Voccola made reference to the\r\nleeward side being calmer, his explanation for the custom was\r\nmerely that it was \"easier\" to approach from the leeward side.  He\r\ndid not explicitly address the specific justifications offered by\r\nTitus, nor did he state that Titus was negligent in the manner in\r\nwhich he approached from the windward side.  Some of his testimony\r\nreferred to the transportation of passengers, not grout.\r\nAfter carefully considering the evidence in the record,\r\nwe do not have a definite and firm conviction that the magistrate\r\njudge erred in concluding that Titus was not negligent in his\r\nchoice to approach the barge from the windward, rather than the\r\nleeward side.  The magistrate judge's finding is not clearly\r\nerroneous.\r\nHalpin next argues that even if Titus were not negligent\r\nin approaching from the windward side, he must have been negligent\r\nin some manner because he hit the pier, a stationary object.  We\r\nhave stated, \"when a vessel under its own power collides with an\r\nanchored vessel or a navigational structure, the burden of proving\r\nabsence of fault or vis major rests on the pilot vessel.\"  City of\r\nBoston v. S.S. Texaco Texas, 773 F.2d 1396, 1398 (1st Cir. 1985). \r\nHowever, Halpin did not establish this presumption below.  See 21\r\nCharles Alan Wright &amp; Kenneth W. Graham, Federal Practice and\r\nProcedure,  5125 at 596 (1977) (in order to establish a\r\npresumption, the proponent must first satisfy the court that the\r\npresumption exists).  Halpin failed to make any mention of the\r\npresumption, much less give any analysis or supply legal authority. \r\nSee McCoy v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 950 F.2d 13, 22\r\n(1st Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 910 (1992)(theory waived\r\nwhen at district court only passing mention made and no analysis or\r\npresentation of legal authority supporting the theory).  The\r\nmagistrate judge did not err in failing to apply the presumption.\r\nWithout the presumption, it was Halpin's burden to\r\npersuade the magistrate judge that Titus was negligent by his act\r\nor omission.  Contact with the pier may suggest a negligent act or\r\nomission, but the magistrate judge's failure to draw that inference\r\nis not clearly erroneous.  To hold that it is clearly erroneous, \r\nin effect, would be giving Halpin the benefit of the presumption\r\neven though he did not raise it.\r\nThe trial may well have proceeded on the mistaken premise\r\nthat Halpin carried the burden of persuasion, but it was Halpin's\r\nobligation to see that it did not.  Halpin, not Atkinson, must bear\r\nthe risk that the circumstantial evidence, without the presumption,\r\nwould not persuade the magistrate judge.\r\n                      III.\r\nOur conclusion that the magistrate judge did not clearly\r\nerr in finding that Titus was not negligent eliminates any need for\r\ndiscussion of the standard of care applicable to Halpin's\r\ncomparative negligence.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

To hold that it is clearly erroneous, \r\nin effect, would be giving Halpin the benefit of the presumption\r\neven though he did not raise it.\r\nThe trial may well have proceeded on the mistaken premise\r\nthat Halpin carried the burden of persuasion, but it was Halpin's\r\nobligation to see that it did not.  Halpin, not Atkinson, must bear\r\nthe risk that the circumstantial evidence, without the presumption,\r\nwould not persuade the magistrate judge.\r\n                      III.\r\nOur conclusion that the magistrate judge did not clearly\r\nerr in finding that Titus was not negligent eliminates any need for\r\ndiscussion of the standard of care applicable to Halpin's\r\ncomparative negligence.\r\nAffirmed.\n</pre>",
