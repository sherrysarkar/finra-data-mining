He now appeals\r\n\nboth  convictions,  raising as  his  sole  issue whether  the\r\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by allowing testimony at\r\n\ntrial  concerning  a  brutal  beating  in  which  Martin  had\r\n\nallegedly participated.1  After careful review, we affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Background\r                                      Background\r                                                \r\n\n          On January 25, 1994,  Roxann Sullivan was  arrested\r\n\nfor attempting to sell an eighth of an ounce of cocaine to an\r\n\nundercover  police  officer  and   another  individual  at  a\r\n\nCumberland  Farms store  in  Berwick, Maine.   Following  her\r\n\narrest, Sullivan agreed  to cooperate with  the police in  an\r\n\nattempt  to  arrest  her  cocaine  supplier.    Consequently,\r\n\nSullivan  paged  her supplier,  Aaron  Jamison (\"Aaron\"),  to\r\n\narrange  another illegal  drug  transaction  for  later  that\r\n\nevening.   After  several  subsequent phone  calls, in  which\r\n\nSullivan  spoke with  both  Aaron and  the appellant  Martin,\r\n\nAaron agreed  to meet Sullivan at the  Cumberland Farms store\r\n\nwhere the previous buy had taken place.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Codefendant  Aaron Jamison  initially filed  a notice  of\r\nappeal  but that appeal was dismissed for want of prosecution\r\non November 14, 1995.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          Following  these  phone  calls,   police  officials\r\n\nequipped Sullivan  with a hidden radio  transmitter, gave her\r\n\nsome serialized  currency, and  drove her, in  Sullivan's own\r\n\ncar,  to  the  Cumberland  Farms  store.    Several  officers\r\n\nfollowed  in a  separate  vehicle  to  provide  surveillance.\r\n\nSeveral minutes later, a  maroon van containing Martin, Aaron\r\n\nand Aaron's  brother, Harry  Jamison, entered  the Cumberland\r\n\nFarms  parking lot.  Martin drove the  van while Aaron sat in\r\n\nthe  front passenger  seat; Harry  Jamison occupied  the rear\r\n\nseat.  Once  she noticed  the van, Sullivan  exited her  car,\r\n\nwalked towards the van and climbed into its middle seat.  She\r\n\nthen  negotiated the  purchase of  an eighth  of an  ounce of\r\n\ncocaine,  eventually exchanging  the serialized  currency she\r\n\nhad been given for  two small packets of cocaine.   Following\r\n\nthe exchange, the police arrested the three occupants  of the\r\n\nvan.\r\n\n          Subsequently, the government tried Martin and Aaron\r\n\ntogether.  At their trial, the court allowed Sullivan and her\r\n\nformer boyfriend, Arthur Myers, to testify  that, in the fall\r\n\nof  1993, Martin and Aaron  had beaten an  individual who had\r\n\nsold  drugs for  Aaron and  had allegedly  cheated him.   The\r\n\ngovernment offered the testimony to prove the existence of an\r\n\nagreement between Martin and  Aaron to conspire to distribute\r\n\ndrugs.  Before  Sullivan took  the stand, the  court held  an\r\n\nextensive sidebar  conference with  the  government and  both\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\ndefense  counsel  concerning  Sullivan's proposed  testimony.\r\n\nDuring  the conference,  the parties  discussed not  only the\r\n\nalleged beating  but also the  fact that Sullivan  feared for\r\n\nher  life  because she  believed  that Martin  and  Aaron had\r\n\npreviously murdered someone in New York.  The court cautioned\r\n\nthe government that eliciting testimony about the alleged New\r\n\nYork  murder  would  be   highly  inflammatory  and  unfairly\r\n\nprejudicial.\r\n\n          With respect to the alleged beating, the government\r\n\noffered that Sullivan and Myers would testify that Martin and\r\n\nAaron had beaten an individual identified as Leon in the fall\r\n\nof  1993.  The government  explained that Leon,  who had sold\r\n\ndrugs  for Aaron, had become heavily indebted to Aaron due to\r\n\nhis own personal use  of cocaine.  Aaron also  suspected that\r\n\nLeon had been short-changing him on proceeds from Leon's drug\r\n\nsales.  The  government added further that Sullivan and Myers\r\n\nwould testify that, prior to the beating, Aaron had told them\r\n\nthat  he and Martin were  planning to straighten  Leon out so\r\n\nthat he would stop using cocaine.\r\n\n          Martin's   counsel   objected   to   the   proposed\r\n\ntestimony,  arguing that  it had no relevance to  the alleged\r\n\nconspiracy  to  distribute cocaine.    The  court denied  the\r\n\nobjection,  ruling that  the testimony  would be  relevant if\r\n\nLeon's debts  were tied to  cocaine.  Aaron's  counsel, while\r\n\nconceding  that the court had  broad discretion under Fed. R.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nEvid.  4032  to  decide   whether  to  allow  the  testimony,\r\n\nnonetheless  argued  that  the  prejudicial  impact   of  the\r\n\nproposed testimony outweighed its probative value.  The court\r\n\ndeclined to  prohibit the testimony, but  offered to instruct\r\n\nthe  jury  that \"this  defendant  is  not being  charged  for\r\n\nviolence  or any such activity, you may only consider this as\r\n\nit bears upon the charge of conspiracy or possession.\"\r\n\n          During  Sullivan's  and  Myer's ensuing  testimony,\r\n\nneither counsel raised any further objections on the basis of\r\n\nunfair prejudice.3  Following  the testimony of each witness,\r\n\nthe court sua sponte  gave an expanded cautionary instruction\r                                \r\n\ngenerally  along the  lines of  what it  had proposed  at the\r\n\nsidebar conference.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\n                          Discussion\r                                      Discussion\r                                                \r\n\n          On appeal, Martin  challenges the district  court's\r\n\nfailure  to exclude  the  testimony concerning  the  beating.\r\n\nMartin argues that the connection between the beating and any\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Fed. R. Evid 403 provides in relevant part:\r\n\n          Although   relevant,   evidence  may   be\r\n          excluded  if  its   probative  value   is\r\n          substantially outweighed by the danger of\r\n          unfair   prejudice,   confusion  of   the\r\n          issues, or misleading the jury . . . .\r\n\n3.  During  Sullivan's  testimony  about  the   beating,  two\r\nobjections were made, one on the basis of hearsay and another\r\non  the   basis  that  an   answer  given  by   Sullivan  was\r\nnonresponsive.   The  court  denied the  first objection  and\r\nsustained the second.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nalleged agreement to distribute  cocaine was tenuous at best,\r\n\nand  that the graphic details elicited about the brutality of\r\n\nthe   beating   were   highly   inflammatory   and   unfairly\r\n\nprejudicial.   At  the outset,  however, we note  that Martin\r\n\neffectively  forfeited   this  issue  by  failing  to  object\r\n\ncontemporaneously at  trial to the  now-challenged testimony.\r\n\nWhile  Martin initially  raised concerns  about the  proposed\r\n\ntestimony  during the  sidebar conference,  at that  point in\r\n\ntime, no witness was  before the jury, no questions  had been\r\n\nposed and no  evidence about  the beating  had been  adduced.\r\n\nLacking  such  context,  the  court  could  not  definitively\r\n\nbalance the  government's need  for the evidence  against any\r\n\ncorrespondent risk of unfair prejudice that it posed.   Thus,\r\n\nany  ruling  at  that  point was  preliminary,  and  Martin's\r\n\nfailure  to  raise   subsequent  contemporaneous   objections\r\n\nforfeited the issue.   See, e.g.,  United States v.  Griffin,\r                                                                        \r\n\n818  F.2d  97, 105  (1st Cir.),  cert.  denied, 484  U.S. 844\r                                                          \r\n\n(1987) (holding  that a  motion in  limine,  even one  raised\r                                                      \r\n\nduring  trial,  does  not  preserve  an  issue  for  appeal).\r\n\nIndeed, at oral argument before this court, Martin's counsel,\r\n\nnoting the absence of contemporaneous objections, essentially\r\n\nconceded  that  trial   counsel  had  forfeited  the   issue.\r\n\nAccordingly,  we review  only for  plain error.   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nUnited States v.  Winter, 70  F.3d 655, 659  (1st Cir.  1995)\r                                    \r\n\n(forfeited errors reviewed only for plain error).\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          In any event,  there is no  error, much less  plain\r\n\nerror,  in this  case.  Under  Rule 403, a  court may exclude\r\n\nrelevant evidence only if the evidence poses a risk of unfair\r\n\nprejudice that substantially  outweighs its probative  value.\r\n\nSee  Fed.  R. Evid  403.    We accord  great  deference to  a\r               \r\n\ndistrict  court's judgment  on such  issues, and  will review\r\n\neven properly preserved  assertions of error only for a clear\r\n\nabuse  of discretion.  See, e.g., United States v. Lopez, 944\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 33, 38 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n          The fact  that Martin had  previously helped  Aaron\r\n\nbeat  up a  former associate  who had  been taking  money and\r\n\ndrugs from Aaron tended to show Martin's participation in the\r\n\nconspiracy.  A factfinder  could reasonably infer that Martin\r\n\nwould not have helped Aaron in such an endeavor unless he had\r\n\na  personal interest in the success  of the drug distribution\r\n\nventure.   Thus, the  evidence was  clearly probative on  the\r\n\nissue of whether an agreement  existed.  Furthermore, as  the\r\n\ndistrict  court correctly  noted, the government  needed this\r\n\nevidence  to help  refute Martin's  contention that  his mere\r\n\npresence  in the van  during the cocaine  transaction did not\r\n\nestablish that he  had conspired  with Aaron.   On the  other\r\n\nside of the  scale, we  agree that the  testimony posed  some\r\n\nrisk of unfair  prejudice.4  Nonetheless, we  cannot say that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  Specifically, Martin points to Sullivan's statements that\r\nAaron told her that  they had left Leon \"dead  and stinking,\"\r\nand that she had  observed Aaron and Martin hitting  Leon and\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nthe risk so  outweighed the testimony's undeniable  probative\r\n\nvalue  as   to  constitute  a  clear   abuse  of  discretion.\r\n\nMoreover, we think the district court substantially minimized\r\n\nthe  risk by  carefully instructing the  jury that  it should\r\n\nconsider the  testimony only for the  purpose of establishing\r\n\nthe conspiracy.\r\n\n                             III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                          Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          For the  foregoing reasons, Martin's  conviction is\r\n\naffirmed.\r            affirmed\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\ntearing  off  his  clothes.   Martin  also  notes that  Myers\r\ntestified  that  Aaron  and   Martin  \"were  kicking  [Leon],\r\npunching him, threw a  bike at him, [and] they  made him take\r\noff all his clothes, [and] took his money.\"  \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n",

Following her arrest, Sullivan agreed to cooperate with the police in an attempt to arrest her cocaine supplier.   Consequently, Sullivan paged her supplier, Aaron Jamison (\"Aaron\"), to arrange another illegal drug transaction for later that evening.   After several subsequent phone calls, in which Sullivan spoke with both Aaron and the appellant Martin, Aaron agreed to meet Sullivan at the Cumberland Farms store where the previous buy had taken place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following these phone calls, police officials equipped Sullivan with a hidden radio transmitter, gave her some serialized currency, and drove her, in Sullivan's own car, to the Cumberland Farms store.

Following the exchange, the police arrested the three occupants of the van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the government tried Martin and Aaron together.   At their trial, the court allowed Sullivan and her former boyfriend, Arthur Myers, to testify that, in the fall of 1993, Martin and Aaron had beaten an individual who had sold drugs for Aaron and had allegedly cheated him.   The government offered the testimony to prove the existence of an agreement between Martin and Aaron to conspire to distribute drugs.   Before Sullivan took the stand, the court held an extensive sidebar conference with the government and both defense counsel concerning Sullivan's proposed testimony.   During the conference, the parties discussed not only the alleged beating but also the fact that Sullivan feared for her life because she believed that Martin and Aaron had previously murdered someone in New York.  The court cautioned the government that eliciting testimony about the alleged New York murder would be highly inflammatory and unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the alleged beating, the government offered that Sullivan and Myers would testify that Martin and Aaron had beaten an individual identified as Leon in the fall of 1993.   The government explained that Leon, who had sold drugs for Aaron, had become heavily indebted to Aaron due to his own personal use of cocaine.   Aaron also suspected that Leon had been short-changing him on proceeds from Leon's drug sales.   The government added further that Sullivan and Myers would testify that, prior to the beating, Aaron had told them that he and Martin were planning to straighten Leon out so that he would stop using cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Martin's counsel objected to the proposed testimony, arguing that it had no relevance to the alleged conspiracy to distribute cocaine.   The court denied the objection, ruling that the testimony would be relevant if Leon's debts were tied to cocaine.   Aaron's counsel, while conceding that the court had broad discretion under Fed.R.Evid. 403<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> to decide whether to allow the testimony, nonetheless argued that the prejudicial impact of the proposed testimony outweighed its probative value.   The court declined to prohibit the testimony, but offered to instruct the jury that \"this defendant is not being charged for violence or any such activity, you may only consider this as it bears upon the charge of conspiracy or possession.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Sullivan's and Myer's ensuing testimony, neither counsel raised any further objections on the basis of unfair prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Following the testimony of each witness, the court sua sponte gave an expanded cautionary instruction generally along the lines of what it had proposed at the sidebar conference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Martin challenges the district court's failure to exclude the testimony concerning the beating.   Martin argues that the connection between the beating and any alleged agreement to distribute cocaine was tenuous at best, and that the graphic details elicited about the brutality of the beating were highly inflammatory and unfairly prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, however, we note that Martin effectively forfeited this issue by failing to object contemporaneously at trial to the now-challenged testimony.   While Martin initially raised concerns about the proposed testimony during the sidebar conference, at that point in time, no witness was before the jury, no questions had been posed and no evidence about the beating had been adduced.   Lacking such context, the court could not definitively balance the government's need for the evidence against any correspondent risk of unfair prejudice that it posed.   Thus, any ruling at that point was preliminary, and Martin's failure to raise subsequent contemporaneous objections forfeited the issue.  See, e.g., United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 105 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844 (1987) (holding that a motion in limine, even one raised during trial, does not preserve an issue for appeal).   Indeed, at oral argument before this court, Martin's counsel, noting the absence of contemporaneous objections, essentially conceded that trial counsel had forfeited the issue.   Accordingly, we review only for plain error.  See, e.g., United States v. Winter, 70 F.3d 655, 659 (1st Cir.1995) (forfeited errors reviewed only for plain error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, there is no error, much less plain error, in this case.   Under Rule 403, a court may exclude relevant evidence only if the evidence poses a risk of unfair prejudice that substantially outweighs its probative value.   See Fed.  R. Evid 403.   We accord great deference to a district court's judgment on such issues, and will review even properly preserved assertions of error only for a clear abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 38 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Martin had previously helped Aaron beat up a former associate who had been taking money and drugs from Aaron tended to show Martin's participation in the conspiracy.   A factfinder could reasonably infer that Martin would not have helped Aaron in such an endeavor unless he had a personal interest in the success of the drug distribution venture.   Thus, the evidence was clearly probative on the issue of whether an agreement existed.   Furthermore, as the district court correctly noted, the government needed this evidence to help refute Martin's contention that his mere presence in the van during the cocaine transaction did not establish that he had conspired with Aaron.   On the other side of the scale, we agree that the testimony posed some risk of unfair prejudice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Nonetheless, we cannot say that the risk so outweighed the testimony's undeniable probative value as to constitute a clear abuse of discretion.   Moreover, we think the district court substantially minimized the risk by carefully instructing the jury that it should consider the testimony only for the purpose of establishing the conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, Martin's conviction is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Codefendant Aaron Jamison initially filed a notice of appeal but that appeal was dismissed for want of prosecution on November 14, 1995</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Fed.

He now appeals both convictions, raising as his sole issue whether the district court abused its discretion by allowing testimony at trial concerning a brutal beating in which Martin had allegedly participated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 25, 1994, Roxann Sullivan was arrested for attempting to sell an eighth of an ounce of cocaine to an undercover police officer and another individual at a Cumberland Farms store in Berwick, Maine.   Following her arrest, Sullivan agreed to cooperate with the police in an attempt to arrest her cocaine supplier.   Consequently, Sullivan paged her supplier, Aaron Jamison (\"Aaron\"), to arrange another illegal drug transaction for later that evening.   After several subsequent phone calls, in which Sullivan spoke with both Aaron and the appellant Martin, Aaron agreed to meet Sullivan at the Cumberland Farms store where the previous buy had taken place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following these phone calls, police officials equipped Sullivan with a hidden radio transmitter, gave her some serialized currency, and drove her, in Sullivan's own car, to the Cumberland Farms store.   Several officers followed in a separate vehicle to provide surveillance.   Several minutes later, a maroon van containing Martin, Aaron and Aaron's brother, Harry Jamison, entered the Cumberland Farms parking lot.   Martin drove the van while Aaron sat in the front passenger seat;  Harry Jamison occupied the rear seat.   Once she noticed the van, Sullivan exited her car, walked towards the van and climbed into its middle seat.   She then negotiated the purchase of an eighth of an ounce of cocaine, eventually exchanging the serialized currency she had been given for two small packets of cocaine.   Following the exchange, the police arrested the three occupants of the van.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequently, the government tried Martin and Aaron together.
