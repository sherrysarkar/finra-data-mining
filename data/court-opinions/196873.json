Upon careful  review of the record and\r                                \r\r\n\nappellate  briefs,  it clearly  appears  that  no substantial\r\n\nquestion is presented for review.  \r\n\n          Because appellant  did not ask  the district  court\r\n\nfor a  transfer and made no showing  that a transfer would be\r\n\nin the  interest of  justice, we  conclude that  the district\r\n\ncourt did not abuse  its discretion in failing to  order one.\r\n\nSee 28  U.S.C.    1406(a);  Cote v.
