Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n            Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nJesus Hernandez Snchez and Alberto Acevedo Colom on brief for\r\nappellant.\r\nFrancisco Chvere, Angel M. Cuevas-Trisn, and McConnell\r\nValdes on brief for appellee.\r\n\nSeptember 21, 1998\r\n\n                             Per Curiam.  In the suit that underlies this appeal,\r\nplaintiff-appellant Ana Snchez Seplveda (Snchez) sued her\r\nquondam employer, Motorola Electrnica de P.R., Inc. (Motorola),\r\nalleging that Motorola constructively discharged her in violation\r\nof the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C.A. \r\n621-634 (West Supp. 1998), and local law, specifically, P.R. Laws\r\nAnn. tit. 29,  146 (1995) (Law 100).  After a period of pretrial\r\ndiscovery, Motorola moved for summary judgment.  The district court\r\ngranted this motion and entered summary judgment for the defendant. \r\nSee Snchez Seplveda v. Motorola Electrnica de P.R., Inc., 988 F.\r\nSupp. 34 (D.P.R. 1997).  Snchez appeals.  Having determined that\r\noral argument would not advance the decisional process, we\r\nsummarily affirm.  See 1st Cir. R. 27.1.\r\nOn whole-record review, we believe that this is a\r\nsuitable case in which to act upon our long-held belief that \"when\r\na lower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision, an\r\nappellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other\r\nend than to hear its own words resonate.\"  Lawton v. State Mut.\r\nLife Assur. Co. of Am., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996); accordIn re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel Fire Litig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).  Hence, we affirm the judgment for substantially the\r\nreasons set forth in the opinion below.  We add only a small coda.\r\nIn her brief, Snchez rehashes the evidence and invites\r\nus to take a more expansive view of the facts than did Judge\r\nPieras.  We decline the invitation.  When summary judgment is at\r\nstake, we, like the trial court, must scrutinize the record in the\r\nlight most favorable to the nonmoving party, \"indulging all\r\nreasonable inferences in that party's favor,\" Griggs-Ryan v. Smith,\r\n904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir. 1990) (emphasis supplied), but\r\ndisregarding unsupported allegations, unreasonable inferences, and\r\nconclusory speculation.  See Smith v. F.W. Morse &amp; Co., 76 F.3d\r\n413, 428 (1st Cir. 1996); Medina-Muoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco\r\nCo., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).  If no genuine issue of\r\nmaterial fact percolates through the record, then summary judgment\r\nis proper.  After all, the core purpose of summary judgment is \"to\r\npierce the boilerplate of the pleadings\" and appraise the proof to\r\ndetermine whether a trial is needed.  Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of\r\nMed., 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir. 1992).  Here, there is no warrant\r\nto remit the case for trial.\r\nWe will not dawdle.  Despite the liberality of the Fed.\r\nR. Civ. P. 56 standard, the party opposing summary judgment is not\r\nentitled to the benefit of every inference that she can imagine;\r\nshe only entitled to the benefit of reasonable inferences.  SeeNational Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).  In this case, even assuming, arguendo, that Motorola\r\nconstructively discharged the appellant and that its reasons for\r\ndoing so were pretextual   both of which assumptions are\r\nproblematic   there is simply no significantly probative evidence\r\nof any age-related animus.\r\nWe need go no further.  Since such proof is an absolute\r\nprerequisite to recovery in an age discrimination case, see, e.g.,\r\nMesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 828 (1st Cir. 1991);\r\nMedina-Muoz, 896 F.2d at 9, the district court acted within its\r\nproper office in granting the summary judgment motion.\r\n\nAffirmed.\n",
