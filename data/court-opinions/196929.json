A\r\n\nsuperseding indictment  alleged  that appellants  belonged  to  a\r\n\ntwenty-six member gang that operated  a \"drug point\" in Toa Baja,\r\n\nPuerto Rico, and used firearms  to defend against rival gangs and\r\n\ndiscourage honest citizens from informing the police.\r\n\n          Appellants initially  pled not  guilty to  the charges.\r\n\nJust  before  trial,   however,  with  the  advice   of  counsel,\r\n\nappellants  entered guilty  pleas  to  the  drug  conspiracy  and\r\n\nfirearms   counts  and  the  government  agreed  to  dismiss  the\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nremaining counts.  After the district court accepted their guilty\r\n\npleas, and before  sentencing, see Appendix A,  appellants sought\r                                            \r\n\nto withdraw  their pleas.   See  Fed. R.  Crim. P.  32(e) (\"If  a\r                                         \r\n\nmotion to withdraw a plea of guilty . . . is made before sentence\r\n\nis imposed, the  court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if the\r\n\ndefendant shows any fair and  just reason.\").  The district court\r\n\ndenied  their motions and imposed sentences consistent with their\r\n\nrespective plea agreements.  \r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n A.  The Perez Appeal\r           A.  The Perez Appeal\r                               \r\n\n          Perez claims that he was denied effective assistance of\r\n\ncounsel  at the  hearing on  his pro  se motion  to withdraw  his\r                                                  \r\n\nguilty plea.  See U.S. Const. amend. VI.  The government responds\r                           \r\n\nthat Perez (1) did not ask the  court to appoint new counsel, and\r\n\n(2) has  not  shown  that  appointed  counsel,  Jos   R.  Aguayo,\r\n\nEsquire, labored under an actual  conflict of interest within the\r\n\nmeaning  of United  States v. Soldevila-Lopez,  17 F.3d  480 (1st\r                                                       \r\n\nCir. 1994).  \r\n\n          1.  Waiver\r                    1.  Waiver\r                              \r\n\n          The  Sixth Amendment  right to effective  assistance of\r\n\ncounsel inheres at all \"critical stages\" of a criminal proceeding\r\n\nunless competently waived.  United  States v. Mateo, 950 F.2d 44,\r                                                             \r\n\n47 (1st  Cir. 1991).   A plea  withdrawal hearing is  a \"critical\r\n\nstage\" in the criminal proceeding.  United States v. Crowley, 529\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 1066,  1069 (3d  Cir.), cert. denied,  425 U.S.  995 (1976).\r                                                   \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nThe right  to counsel  is not  contingent upon a  request by  the\r\n\ndefendant;  rather, \"we presume  that the defendant  requests the\r\n\nlawyer's  services at every  critical stage of  the prosecution.\"\r\n\nMichigan v.  Jackson, 475  U.S. 625, 633  &amp; n.6  (1986).   In all\r                              \r\n\nevents, Perez requested counsel  at the outset, and the  district\r\n\ncourt appointed  Jos  R. Aguayo, Esquire. \r                           \r\n\n          Thus, contrary to  the government's suggestion, nothing\r\n\nin  the  record  remotely  indicates  that  Perez  knowingly  and\r\n\nvoluntarily waived his  Sixth Amendment right  to counsel at  the\r\n\nplea withdrawal hearing.  Compare  United States v. Saccoccia, 58\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 754,  771-72 (1st  Cir. 1995)  (defendant repeatedly  waived\r\n\nrepresentation  by conflict-free counsel),  cert. denied,  116 S.\r                                                                  \r\n\nCt.  1322 (1996); see also United States v.

Finding no waiver, we next consider\r                \r\n\nwhether  Perez  has  demonstrated  that  court-appointed  counsel\r\n\nfailed  to afford  effective assistance  at  the plea  withdrawal\r\n\nhearing.\r\n\n          2.  Conflict of Interest\r                    2.  Conflict of Interest\r                                            \r\n\n          The government contends that Perez must demonstrate \"an\r\n\nactual  conflict of  interest adversely affect[ing]  his lawyer's\r\n\nperformance.\"  Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486 (quoting Cuyler v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nSullivan, 446 U.S.  335, 348 (1980)).  Thus,  the government says\r                  \r\n\nPerez was  required to  show that  court-appointed counsel  could\r\n\nhave pursued a  plausible alternative tactic or strategy  were it\r\n\nnot for an inherent conflict  of interest or other loyalties that\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ncaused him  not to do so.

Perez  further alleged  that  Aguayo had  not made  even\r\n\n\"minimum\" efforts  to \"act  as his counsel  or defender\"  and was\r\n\nonly interested  in a fee, but see infra  note 1, thus leaving no\r                                                  \r\n\ndoubt that Perez wanted replacement counsel.\r                                 \r\n\n          In United States  v.

The\r                                                          \r\n\ndistrict  court  neither  appointed new  counsel  nor  obtained a\r\n\ncompetent waiver, but instead rejected the plea-withdrawal motion\r\n\nbecause defense counsel denied Ellison's accusations at the plea-\r\n\nwithdrawal hearing.  \r\n\n          The Seventh Circuit held that defense counsel's \"repre-\r\n\nsentation\" at the plea-withdrawal hearing did not meet  the Sixth\r\n\nAmendment minima: \r\n\n          First,  counsel was  not  able to  pursue his\r\n          client's best interests free  from the influ-\r\n          ence of  his concern about  possible self-in-\r\n          crimination. . .  . [I]f  the allegations  in\r\n          defendant's  motion  were true,  his  actions\r\n          would be  tantamount  to  malpractice.    Any\r\n          contention   by   counsel   that  defendant's\r\n          allegations  were  not true  would  (and did)\r\n          contradict his client.  In testifying against\r\n          his client,  counsel acted as  both counselor\r\n          and witness for the prosecution.  These roles\r\n          are inherently inconsistent.   \r\n\nId. at 1107 (citation omitted); see also Lopez v.

The identical  logic fully warrants  the\r\n\nconclusion that  Aguayo may  have been  laboring under  an actual\r\n\nconflict of interest at the hearing on the pro se plea-withdrawal\r                                                           \r\n\nmotion, which alleged  that Aguayo had coerced Perez' guilty plea\r\n\nin order to conceal his unpreparedness for  trial.  Nevertheless,\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nwe  think the  appropriate course in  this case is  to remand for\r\n\nfurther  factfinding on  the  merits  of  the  Perez  allegations\r\n\nagainst Aguayo.

Moreover, the district court\r                      \r\n\nrecord is not \"sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consider-\r\n\nation\" of the merits of the pro se plea-withdrawal motion itself,\r                                            \r\n\nSoldevila-Lopez, 17  F.3d at  486 (quoting  Natanel, 938 F.2d  at\r                                                             \r\n\n309),  since  its   underlying  conflict-of-interest  allegations\r\n\nagainst  Aguayo  were  never  subjected  to  factfinding  in  the\r\n\ndistrict court. \r\n\n          The  district court failed  to determine, in  the first\r\n\ninstance,  whether Perez had  made \"an intelligent  and competent\r\n\nwaiver\" of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel before proceeding\r\n\nto hear the plea-withdrawal motion with Perez acting pro se.

Instead, it opened  the plea-withdrawal\r               \r\n\nhearing with questions to Aguayo about the pro se plea-withdrawal\r                                                           \r\n\nmotion.   Whereupon  Aguayo extolled  the  benefits of  the  plea\r\n\nagreement, stated that  there were no errors in  the earlier Rule\r\n\n11 plea colloquy  conducted by the district court,  nor any basis\r\n\nin  law for  Perez' pro  se plea-withdrawal  motion, and,  in all\r                                     \r\n\nevents, that  Perez was better  off with the plea  bargain, given\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nthe  unlikelihood the  he could  prevail at  trial.   Summing up,\r\n\nAguayo stated:   \"I really don't understand why  [Perez] wants to\r\n\nwithdraw [the plea agreement].\"  Compare United States v. Daniel,\r                                                                          \r\n\n962 F.2d 100, 102 (1st Cir. 1992) (attorney argued vigorously and\r\n\nsuccessfully  for  client  after  raising  potential   conflict).\r\n\nWhatever  their independent merit,1 the views expressed by Aguayo\r\n\nat the plea-withdrawal hearing directly contradicted the position\r\n\nadvocated  by Perez in  the pro se motion  to withdraw his guilty\r                                            \r\n\nplea.

In  all events, at the  outset of\r\nthe  plea-withdrawal hearing, Aguayo  promptly indicated  that he\r\nintended to  withdraw as counsel.  The district court nonetheless\r\nproceeded with the hearing, took no action on Aguayo's withdrawal\r\nsuggestion and, for all intents and  purposes, continued to treat\r\nAguayo  as Perez' counsel, without first determining the disputed\r\nfacts underlying the Perez allegations against Aguayo.

As the hearing transcript plainly demonstrates, the\r\n\nfailure to  conduct the required  factual inquiry resulted  in an\r\n\nunconstitutional  breakdown  in  the  adversarial process,  which\r\n\ncompels a remand  for further proceedings.

Under the well-established framework for  evaluating\r\n\nplea-withdrawal motions,  the district  court  considers all  the\r\n\ncircumstances, with particular attentionto four prominentfactors:\r\n\n          (1) the plausibility of the reasons prompting\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\n          the requested  change of plea; (2) the timing\r\n          of the defendant's motion;  (3) the existence\r\n          or nonexistence of an assertion of innocence;\r\n          and  (4) whether, when viewed in the light of\r\n          emergent circumstances, the  defendant's plea\r\n          appropriately   may   be   characterized   as\r\n          involuntary,    in    derogation    of    the\r\n          requirements imposed  by Fed.

If the defendant carries the burden of\r\n\npersuasion on these  four criteria, the district  court may still\r\n\ndecline  to allow the plea  to be withdrawn  if it would unfairly\r\n\nprejudice the government.

These\r                           \r\n\nappellants  uniformly have failed to identify any defect in their\r\n\nRule 11 plea  colloquies.  Rather, appellants  contend that their\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\npleas   were    rendered   involuntary   by    their   attorneys'\r\n\nrecommendations  to accept  the  plea  bargains  offered  by  the\r\n\ngovernment on  the morning trial  was scheduled to begin.   Their\r\n\ncontentions are meritless. \r\n\n          Special Rule  11  requirements have  been  designed  to\r\n\nminimize the significant risk that \"involuntary\" guilty pleas may\r\n\nbe tendered in response to \"package plea bargain\" offers from the\r\n\ngovernment.   See Martinez-Molina, 64  F.3d 732-34.

At  the sentencing,  the\r\n\ndistrict court  found that  the  agreed sentence  was within  the\r\n\napplicable  guideline range, see  U.S.S.G   6B1.2(c)(1), accepted\r                                          \r\n\nthe plea agreement, see  Ewing, 957 F.2d at 118,  and imposed the\r                                        \r\n\nsentence prescribed in the plea agreement.\r\n\n          Moreover, Arroyo has not squared his view of   6B1.1(c)\r\n\nwith Fed.

But see Olano, 507 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\nat 732-33 (appellant must establish \"error\" under Rule 52(b)).6 \r\n\n          Finally, we  reject  the frivolous  argument  that  the\r\n\nindictment barred  Arroyo from  stipulating to  the base  offense\r\n\nlevel  specified in  the plea  bargain.   Arroyo  pled guilty  to\r\n\nconspiring to distribute  \"not less\" than fifty  grams of cocaine\r\n\nbase,  five kilograms of cocaine, and one kilogram of heroin.  By\r\n\nits plain  language, the  indictment set no  upper limit  on drug\r\n\nquantity.   See United States  v. Lindia, 82 F.3d  1154, 1159 n.3\r                                                  \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996)  (indictment alleging drug dealing \"in excess\" of\r\n\n50 kilograms did not bar  sentence based on quantity greater than\r\n\n50  kilograms).   Although Arroyo  and  several other  appellants\r\n\nchallenge  the  factual  bases  for  the  district  court's  drug\r\n\nquantity determinations as well, their stipulations to their base\r\n\noffense  levels  constitute  admissions to  the  subsidiary  drug\r\n\nquantities,  see  U.S.S.G.    2D1.1(c) (determining  base offense\r                          \r\n\nlevel according to drug quantity).

See Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e).  We remand the Sixth Amendment claim presented by Perez and affirm the district court judgments against the remaining appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1994, a federal grand jury in Puerto Rico returned a five-count indictment charging appellants with, inter alia, conspiracy to distribute not less than fifty grams of cocaine base, five kilograms of cocaine, and one kilogram of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846 (1994), and with using or carrying firearms in connection with a drug offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1) (1994).  A superseding indictment alleged that appellants belonged to a twenty-six member gang that operated a \"drug point\" in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, and used firearms to defend against rival gangs and discourage honest citizens from informing the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants initially pled not guilty to the charges.  Just before trial, however, with the advice of counsel, appellants entered guilty pleas to the drug conspiracy and firearms counts and the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts.  After the district court accepted their guilty pleas, and before sentencing, see Appendix A, appellants sought to withdraw their pleas.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e) (\"If a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty ... is made before sentence is imposed, the court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows any fair and just reason.\").  The district court denied their motions and imposed sentences consistent with their respective plea agreements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. The Perez Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perez claims that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at the hearing on his pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  See U.S. Const. amend.  VI.  The government responds that Perez (1) did not ask the court to appoint new counsel, and (2) has not shown that appointed counsel, Jose R. Aguayo, Esquire, labored under an actual conflict of interest within the meaning of United States v. Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d 480 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Waiver</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel inheres at all \"critical stages\" of a criminal proceeding unless competently waived.  United States v. Mateo, 950 F.2d 44, 47 (1st Cir.1991).  A plea withdrawal hearing is a \"critical stage\" in the criminal proceeding.  United States v. Crowley, 529 F.2d 1066, 1069 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 995, 96 S.Ct. 2209, 48 L.Ed.2d 820 (1976).  The right to counsel is not contingent upon a request by the defendant;  rather, \"we presume that the defendant requests the lawyer's services at every critical stage of the prosecution.\"  Michigan v. Jackson, 475 U.S. 625, 633 &amp; n. 6, 106 S.Ct. 1404, 1409 &amp; n. 6, 89 L.Ed.2d 631 (1986).  In all events, Perez requested counsel at the outset, and the district court appointed Jose R. Aguayo, Esquire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, contrary to the government's suggestion, nothing in the record remotely indicates that Perez knowingly and voluntarily waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel at the plea withdrawal hearing.  Compare United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 771-72 (1st Cir.1995) (defendant repeatedly waived representation by conflict-free counsel), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1322, 134 L.Ed.2d 474 (1996);  see also United States v. Betancourt-Arretuche, 933 F.2d 89, 92 (1st Cir.)  (discussing waiver elements), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 959, 112 S.Ct. 421, 116 L.Ed.2d 441 (1991).  Finding no waiver, we next consider whether Perez has demonstrated that court-appointed counsel failed to afford effective assistance at the plea withdrawal hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Conflict of Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government contends that Perez must demonstrate \"an actual conflict of interest adversely affect[ing] his lawyer's performance.\"  Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486 (quoting Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980)).  Thus, the government says, Perez was required to show that court-appointed counsel could have pursued a plausible alternative tactic or strategy were it not for an inherent conflict of interest or other loyalties that caused him not to do so.  Id.; Guaraldi v. Cunningham, 819 F.2d 15, 17 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We noted in Soldevila-Lopez that \"[c]ourts have recognized actual conflicts of interest between an attorney and his client when pursuit of a client's interests would lead to evidence of an attorney's malpractice.\"  Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486 (citing United States v. Ellison, 798 F.2d 1102, 1106-08 (7th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1038, 107 S.Ct. 893, 93 L.Ed.2d 845 (1987), and Mathis v. Hood, 937 F.2d 790, 795 (2d Cir.1991)).  The absence of any malpractice or ethics complaint in Soldevila-Lopez nonetheless led us to conclude that a conflict-of-interest finding should not be based solely on an inference that the client might have benefited had defense counsel raised the client's mental incompetency claim prior to trial.  Id. at 486-87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's contention that Perez' Sixth Amendment claim is indistinguishable from that in Soldevila-Lopez is untenable, since Perez plainly alleged facts amounting to malpractice, if found to be true.  That is, the Perez motion to withdraw his guilty plea alleged that Aguayo had pressured him into pleading guilty at the earlier Rule 11 change-of-plea hearing in order to \"hide [Aguayo's] lack of preparation\" for trial.  Perez further alleged that Aguayo had not made even \"minimum\" efforts to \"act as his counsel or defender\" and was only interested in a fee, but see infra note 1, thus leaving no doubt that Perez wanted replacement counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Ellison, 798 F.2d 1102 (7th Cir.1986), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 1038, 107 S.Ct. 893, 93 L.Ed.2d 845 (1987), the district court was presented with a virtually identical situation in which the defendant had filed a pro se motion to withdraw a guilty plea, alleging that court-appointed counsel had persuaded him to forgo trial (despite Ellison's assertions of innocence) because counsel \"did not want to make waves with the federal prosecutors with whom he would be working in the future.\"  Id. at 1106.   The district court neither appointed new counsel nor obtained a competent waiver, but instead rejected the plea-withdrawal motion because defense counsel denied Ellison's accusations at the plea-withdrawal hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Seventh Circuit held that defense counsel's \"representation\" at the plea-withdrawal hearing did not meet the Sixth Amendment minima:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>First, counsel was not able to pursue his client's best interests free from the influence of his concern about possible self-incrimination....  [I]f the allegations in defendant's motion were true, his actions would be tantamount to malpractice.  Any contention by counsel that defendant's allegations were not true would (and did) contradict his client.  In testifying against his client, counsel acted as both counselor and witness for the prosecution.  These roles are inherently inconsistent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 1107 (citation omitted);  see also Lopez v. Scully, 58 F.3d 38, 41 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that a pro se motion to withdraw a guilty plea based on alleged attorney coercion created an actual conflict of interest).  The identical logic fully warrants the conclusion that Aguayo may have been laboring under an actual conflict of interest at the hearing on the pro se plea-withdrawal motion, which alleged that Aguayo had coerced Perez' guilty plea in order to conceal his unpreparedness for trial.  Nevertheless, we think the appropriate course in this case is to remand for further factfinding on the merits of the Perez allegations against Aguayo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we recognized in Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486, a claim that counsel was disabled by an actual conflict of interest at a critical stage in the criminal proceeding amounts to an ineffective assistance claim not normally appropriate for consideration on direct appeal.  See United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1079, 112 S.Ct. 986, 117 L.Ed.2d 148 (1992).  Moreover, the district court record is not \"sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration\" of the merits of the pro se plea-withdrawal motion itself, Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486 (quoting Natanel, 938 F.2d at 309), since its underlying conflict-of-interest allegations against Aguayo were never subjected to factfinding in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court failed to determine, in the first instance, whether Perez had made \"an intelligent and competent waiver\" of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel before the court proceeded to hear the plea-withdrawal motion with Perez acting pro se.  See Mateo, 950 F.2d at 47.   Instead, it opened the plea-withdrawal hearing with questions to Aguayo about the pro se plea-withdrawal motion.  Whereupon Aguayo extolled the benefits of the plea agreement, stated that there were no errors in the earlier Rule 11 plea colloquy conducted by the district court, nor bases in law for Perez' pro se plea-withdrawal motion, and, in all events, that Perez was better off with the plea bargain, given the unlikelihood that he could prevail at trial.  Summing up, Aguayo stated:  \"I really don't understand why [Perez] wants to withdraw [the plea agreement].\"  Compare United States v. Daniel, 962 F.2d 100, 102 (1st Cir.1992) (attorney argued vigorously and successfully for client after raising potential conflict).  Whatever their independent merit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the views expressed by Aguayo at the plea-withdrawal hearing directly contradicted the position advocated by Perez in the pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  Thus, the Rule 32(e) hearing record leaves no doubt that Perez was left to fend for himself, without representation by counsel.  But see Crowley, 529 F.2d at 1069 (plea withdrawal hearing is \"critical stage\" in criminal proceeding).  Consequently, Perez was denied effective assistance at the plea-withdrawal hearing.  See Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486;  Ellison, 798 F.2d at 1106-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In many instances a trial court may have no reason to question whether counsel's personal or professional interests might preclude \"effective assistance\" to the defendant.  In such circumstances, fair and efficient criminal justice may depend in significant part upon the ethical obligation of defense counsel to inform the court whenever a conflict of interest arises in the course of the proceedings.  Guaraldi, 819 F.2d at 18.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  On the other hand, when the trial court learns or has reason to know that there is a colorable conflict, it should initiate an appropriate inquiry to safeguard the accused's Sixth Amendment rights.  Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 487;  United States v. Allen, 789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir.)  (\"Where the accused voices objection to appointed counsel, the trial court should inquire into the reasons for the dissatisfaction.\"), cert. denied, 479 U.S. 846, 107 S.Ct. 164, 93 L.Ed.2d 103 (1986);  see generally 2 Wayne R. LaFave &amp; Jerold H. Israel, Criminal Procedure &#167; 11.4(b), at pp. 36-37 (1984) (replacement of appointed counsel);  cf. Fed.R.Crim.P. 44(c) (mandating inquiry into joint representation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the clarity and specificity of the malpractice allegations in the pro se plea-withdrawal motion filed by Perez, and Aguayo's sua sponte attempt to terminate his representation at the outset of the plea-withdrawal hearing, the appropriate course for the district court was to resolve the factual dispute in keeping with the adversarial nature of the plea-withdrawal request.  Moreover, absent a proper waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and a knowing and voluntary election to proceed pro se on the Rule 32(e) motion, see Ellison, 798 F.2d at 1108-09;  United States v. Wadsworth, 830 F.2d 1500, 1510-11 (9th Cir.1987), appointment of replacement counsel was the only appropriate course.  As the hearing transcript plainly demonstrates, the failure to conduct the required factual inquiry resulted in an unconstitutional breakdown in the adversarial process, which compels a remand for further proceedings.  See Cuyler, 446 U.S. at 349-50, 100 S.Ct. at 1718-19 (rejecting harmless error analysis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court shall appoint replacement counsel for Perez at a plea-withdrawal hearing reconvened for factfinding purposes to determine the merits of Perez' allegations against Aguayo, so as to enable its ultimate determination whether the guilty plea itself was rendered involuntary by a violation of Perez' Sixth Amendment right to counsel at all critical stages of the proceeding.  See Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56, 106 S.Ct. 366, 369, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985) (ineffective assistance during bargaining may render plea involuntary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>B. The Plea Withdrawal Motions by the Remaining Defendants</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the claims advanced by the remaining defendants.  Under the well-established framework for evaluating plea-withdrawal motions, the district court considers all the circumstances, with particular attention to four prominent factors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>(1) the plausibility of the reasons prompting the requested change of plea;  (2) the timing of the defendant's motion;  (3) the existence or nonexistence of an assertion of innocence;  and (4) whether, when viewed in the light of emergent circumstances, the defendant's plea appropriately may be characterized as involuntary, in derogation of the requirements imposed by Fed.R.Crim.P. 11, or otherwise legally suspect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d 368, 371 (1st Cir.1994) (footnote omitted).  If the defendant carries the burden of persuasion on these four criteria, the district court may still decline to allow the plea to be withdrawn if it would unfairly prejudice the government.  United States v. Doyle, 981 F.2d 591, 594 (1st Cir.1992).  Moreover, absent a demonstrable abuse of discretion, we will not reverse a district court decision granting or denying a request to withdraw a guilty plea filed before sentencing.  United States v. Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 732 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Voluntariness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most prominent single factor--whether these pleas were knowing, voluntary, and intelligent, within the meaning of Criminal Rule 11(d), United States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 94, 133 L.Ed.2d 49 (1995)--does not favor these appellants.  We have found no abuse of discretion in disallowing plea withdrawal motions where Rule 11 safeguards were scrupulously followed by the district court.  See, e.g., United States v. Austin, 948 F.2d 783, 787 (1st Cir.1991).  These appellants uniformly have failed to identify any defect in their Rule 11 plea colloquies.  Rather, appellants contend that their pleas were rendered involuntary by their attorneys' recommendations to accept the plea bargains offered by the government on the morning trial was scheduled to begin.  Their contentions are meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Special Rule 11 requirements have been designed to minimize the significant risk that \"involuntary\" guilty pleas may be tendered in response to \"package plea bargain\" offers from the government.  See Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d at 732-34.   The Rule 11 hearing transcripts in this case disclose that each appellant repeatedly informed the district court that his guilty plea had not been coerced by anyone, thereby substantiating the threshold voluntariness determination for Rule 11(d) purposes.  United States v. Martinez-Martinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1223 (1st Cir.1995) (inquiring whether anyone has coerced the plea satisfies Rule 11), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1343, 134 L.Ed.2d 492 (1996);  compare Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d at 733-34 (inquiry restricted to prosecutorial coercion insufficient).  Consequently, without more, their general allegations of coercion, based on the imminence of trial or conflict-free defense counsel's enthusiasm for the negotiated plea bargain, are insufficient to establish an abuse of discretion.  Austin, 948 F.2d at 786-87 (noting that court has discretion to refuse withdrawal of \"eleventh hour\" plea).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Timing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The delays in filing their Rule 32(e) motions likewise handicap appellants' challenges.  See Appendix A.  Even a request filed prior to sentencing, United States v. Isom, 85 F.3d 831, 838-39 (1st Cir.1996), must meet the challenge that \"the longer a defendant waits before moving to withdraw his plea, the more potency his motion must have in order to gain favorable consideration.\"  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373.   These appellants, on the other hand, offer neither plausible grounds for withdrawing their pleas, nor explanations for their extended delays in filing Rule 32(e) motions.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595 (\"the timing of a defendant's attempted plea withdrawal is highly probative of motive\");  United States v. Ramos, 810 F.2d 308, 312 (1st Cir.1987) (contemplating change of heart within days of plea).  Thus, the district court soundly concluded that their belated plea-withdrawal motions substantially weakened appellants' claims that their guilty pleas resulted from confusion or coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Claims of Innocence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their belated claims of innocence likewise fail to tilt the balance.  The district judge is better positioned to determine whether claims of innocence are credible.  See Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 371.   Defendants freely admitted their guilt during the flawless Rule 11 proceedings conducted below, and the subsequent Rule 32(e) hearing record evinces only weak and implausible assertions of innocence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district court need not credit bare protestations of legal innocence.  Isom, 85 F.3d at 839.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again we emphasize:  there is no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea, Austin, 948 F.2d at 786;  the decision is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 371 (noting that district judges possess special insight into the dynamics of their cases).  Thus, the totality of the circumstances fully supports the rulings that these appellants presented no fair and just reason to vacate their pleas.  No more was required.  Isom, 85 F.3d at 839 (failure to show good cause for withdrawal obviates prejudice-to-government inquiry).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Arroyo Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time, Arroyo contends that the district court violated U.S.S.G. &#167; 6B1.1(c) by allowing him to plead guilty before it considered his presentence report (\"PSR\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  As Arroyo concedes, however, the failure to raise this claim below mandates \"plain error\" review.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b);  see also United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaw in Arroyo's position is that he offers no reason for equating acceptance of his guilty plea with the acceptance of a plea agreement under &#167; 6B1.1(c).  See United States v. Ewing, 957 F.2d 115, 118 (4th Cir.)  (rejecting similar argument), cert. denied, 505 U.S. 1210, 112 S.Ct. 3008, 120 L.Ed.2d 882 (1992).  Arroyo entered a guilty plea on September 7, 1994, and, in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(2) (permitting district court to defer decision to accept or reject Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreements), the district court announced that its acceptance of the plea agreement was conditioned upon its review of the PSR.  See United States v. Johnson, 53 F.3d 831, 832-33 (7th Cir.1995) (finding, on similar facts, that defendant had not been sentenced at Rule 11 hearing).  A PSR was submitted to the district court in timely fashion prior to sentencing on February 13, 1995.  At the sentencing, the district court found that the agreed sentence was within the applicable guideline range, see U.S.S.G &#167; 6B1.2(c)(1), accepted the plea agreement, see Ewing, 957 F.2d at 118, and imposed the sentence prescribed in the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Arroyo has not squared his view of &#167; 6B1.1(c) with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(3), which prohibits submission of a PSR until the defendant has pleaded or been found guilty, unless the defendant consents in writing.  The overarching purpose served by the PSR is to assist the district court at sentencing.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.1 &amp; Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(1) (requiring completed PSR \"before the sentence is imposed\").  Nor are we persuaded that the district court erred.  But see Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-33, 113 S.Ct. at 1776-77 (appellant must establish \"error\" under Rule 52(b)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject the frivolous argument that the indictment barred Arroyo from stipulating to the base offense level specified in the plea bargain.  Arroyo pled guilty to conspiring to distribute \"not less\" than fifty grams of cocaine base, five kilograms of cocaine, and one kilogram of heroin.  By its plain language, the indictment set no upper limit on drug quantity.  See United States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154, 1159 n. 3 (1st Cir.1996) (indictment alleging drug dealing \"in excess\" of 50 kilograms did not bar sentence based on quantity greater than 50 kilograms).  Although Arroyo and several other appellants challenge the factual bases for the district court's drug quantity determinations as well, their stipulations to their base offense levels constitute admissions to the subsidiary drug quantities, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c) (determining base offense level according to drug quantity).  See Lindia, 82 F.3d at 1159-60, &amp; 1160 n. 3 (suggesting that guilty plea might preclude drug quantity challenge).  As the record otherwise discloses adequate factual support for the agreed-upon sentence, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f) (accuracy of plea), and Arroyo's remaining arguments merit no discussion, we affirm the district court judgment against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is remanded for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, see supra pp. 22-23, on the merits of the pro se plea-withdrawal motion filed by Perez, as to which we express no opinion.  Notwithstanding our confidence in the district judge who presided over these proceedings, whose conduct of the other plea-withdrawal proceedings was exemplary, we direct that the Perez matter be assigned to a different judge on remand.  Mateo, 950 F.2d at 50 n. 10.   As the five remaining appellants have demonstrated no error in their plea-withdrawal proceedings, and their remaining arguments are meritless, the district court judgments relating to those defendants are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <pre>APPENDIX A\n                        Withdrawal\nAppellant  Guilty Plea  Motion                 Reasons\nArroyo     9/07/94      12/27/94,              Didn't understand plea\n                          supplemented on        agreement; Rule 11 violations;\n                          1/09/95 and            claimed innocence.\n                          2/13/95.\nGarcia     9/07/94      11/28/94               Attorney coercion; thought it\n                                                 was all or none package deal;\n                                                 limited education.\nLopez      9/07/94      2/02/95                Mistakenly thought he had to\n                                                 plead guilty to both counts;\n                                                 innocent of firearms charge.\nQuintero   9/07/94      11/08/94               Attorney and familial coercion;\n                                                 innocent of firearms charge.\nSanchez    9/08/94      12/09/94               Attorney coercion; 18 years of\n                                                 age; preoccupied with federal\n                                                 carjacking trial; innocent of\n                                                 drug charge.</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record discloses cause for Aguayo's concerns for his client (and for the district court's concern as well) since upon conviction Perez would face a ninety-year minimum term of imprisonment, rather than the seventeen-year maximum term negotiated for him under the plea agreement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Were there any substance to Perez' allegations against Aguayo, a matter yet to be addressed by the district court, D.P.R.

See also id.   Rule 1.16(a)(1) (imposing duty to terminate representation).  In all events, at the outset of the plea-withdrawal hearing, Aguayo promptly indicated that he intended to withdraw as counsel.  The district court nonetheless proceeded with the hearing, took no action on Aguayo's withdrawal suggestion and, for all intents and purposes, continued to treat Aguayo as Perez' counsel, without first determining the disputed facts underlying the Perez allegations against Aguayo.  Thus, the linchpin to the ineffective assistance claim--whether Aguayo in fact labored under a conflict of interest--has yet to be subjected to factfinding</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> See Ramos, 810 F.2d at 313 (rejecting \"self-serving, unsupported claim of innocence raised judicially for the first time after the Rule 11 hearing\").

See, e.g., United States v. Velez Carrero, 77 F.3d 11 (1st Cir.1996).

A superseding indictment alleged that appellants belonged to a twenty-six member gang that operated a \"drug point\" in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico, and used firearms to defend against rival gangs and discourage honest citizens from informing the police.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants initially pled not guilty to the charges.  Just before trial, however, with the advice of counsel, appellants entered guilty pleas to the drug conspiracy and firearms counts and the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts.  After the district court accepted their guilty pleas, and before sentencing, see Appendix A, appellants sought to withdraw their pleas.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e) (\"If a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty ... is made before sentence is imposed, the court may permit the plea to be withdrawn if the defendant shows any fair and just reason.\").

Perez further alleged that Aguayo had not made even \"minimum\" efforts to \"act as his counsel or defender\" and was only interested in a fee, but see infra note 1, thus leaving no doubt that Perez wanted replacement counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v.

The identical logic fully warrants the conclusion that Aguayo may have been laboring under an actual conflict of interest at the hearing on the pro se plea-withdrawal motion, which alleged that Aguayo had coerced Perez' guilty plea in order to conceal his unpreparedness for trial.  Nevertheless, we think the appropriate course in this case is to remand for further factfinding on the merits of the Perez allegations against Aguayo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we recognized in Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486, a claim that counsel was disabled by an actual conflict of interest at a critical stage in the criminal proceeding amounts to an ineffective assistance claim not normally appropriate for consideration on direct appeal.

Moreover, the district court record is not \"sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration\" of the merits of the pro se plea-withdrawal motion itself, Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486 (quoting Natanel, 938 F.2d at 309), since its underlying conflict-of-interest allegations against Aguayo were never subjected to factfinding in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court failed to determine, in the first instance, whether Perez had made \"an intelligent and competent waiver\" of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel before the court proceeded to hear the plea-withdrawal motion with Perez acting pro se.  See Mateo, 950 F.2d at 47.   Instead, it opened the plea-withdrawal hearing with questions to Aguayo about the pro se plea-withdrawal motion.  Whereupon Aguayo extolled the benefits of the plea agreement, stated that there were no errors in the earlier Rule 11 plea colloquy conducted by the district court, nor bases in law for Perez' pro se plea-withdrawal motion, and, in all events, that Perez was better off with the plea bargain, given the unlikelihood that he could prevail at trial.  Summing up, Aguayo stated:  \"I really don't understand why [Perez] wants to withdraw [the plea agreement].\"  Compare United States v. Daniel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582532\"><a href=\"/opinion/582532/united-states-v-jose-daniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span>, 102 (1st Cir.1992) (attorney argued vigorously and successfully for client after raising potential conflict).  Whatever their independent merit,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> the views expressed by Aguayo at the plea-withdrawal hearing directly contradicted the position advocated by Perez in the pro se motion to withdraw his guilty plea.  Thus, the Rule 32(e) hearing record leaves no doubt that Perez was left to fend for himself, without representation by counsel.  But see Crowley, 529 F.2d at 1069 (plea withdrawal hearing is \"critical stage\" in criminal proceeding).  Consequently, Perez was denied effective assistance at the plea-withdrawal hearing.  See Soldevila-Lopez, 17 F.3d at 486;  Ellison, 798 F.2d at 1106-08.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In many instances a trial court may have no reason to question whether counsel's personal or professional interests might preclude \"effective assistance\" to the defendant.

Moreover, absent a proper waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and a knowing and voluntary election to proceed pro se on the Rule 32(e) motion, see Ellison, 798 F.2d at 1108-09;  United States v.

As the hearing transcript plainly demonstrates, the failure to conduct the required factual inquiry resulted in an unconstitutional breakdown in the adversarial process, which compels a remand for further proceedings.

These appellants uniformly have failed to identify any defect in their Rule 11 plea colloquies.

See Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d at 732-34.   The Rule 11 hearing transcripts in this case disclose that each appellant repeatedly informed the district court that his guilty plea had not been coerced by anyone, thereby substantiating the threshold voluntariness determination for Rule 11(d) purposes.

Austin, 948 F.2d at 786-87 (noting that court has discretion to refuse withdrawal of \"eleventh hour\" plea).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Timing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The delays in filing their Rule 32(e) motions likewise handicap appellants' challenges.  See Appendix A.  Even a request filed prior to sentencing, United States v. Isom, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196807\"><a href=\"/opinion/196807/united-states-v-isom/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span>, 838-39 (1st Cir.1996), must meet the challenge that \"the longer a defendant waits before moving to withdraw his plea, the more potency his motion must have in order to gain favorable consideration.\"  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 373.   These appellants, on the other hand, offer neither plausible grounds for withdrawing their pleas, nor explanations for their extended delays in filing Rule 32(e) motions.  See Doyle, 981 F.2d at 595 (\"the timing of a defendant's attempted plea withdrawal is highly probative of motive\");  United States v. Ramos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"482471\"><a href=\"/opinion/482471/united-states-v-hector-acevedo-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">810</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span>, 312 (1st Cir.1987) (contemplating change of heart within days of plea).  Thus, the district court soundly concluded that their belated plea-withdrawal motions substantially weakened appellants' claims that their guilty pleas resulted from confusion or coercion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Claims of Innocence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Their belated claims of innocence likewise fail to tilt the balance.  The district judge is better positioned to determine whether claims of innocence are credible.  See Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 371.   Defendants freely admitted their guilt during the flawless Rule 11 proceedings conducted below, and the subsequent Rule 32(e) hearing record evinces only weak and implausible assertions of innocence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The district court need not credit bare protestations of legal innocence.  Isom, 85 F.3d at 839.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again we emphasize:  there is no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea, Austin, 948 F.2d at 786;  the decision is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.  Parrilla-Tirado, 22 F.3d at 371 (noting that district judges possess special insight into the dynamics of their cases).  Thus, the totality of the circumstances fully supports the rulings that these appellants presented no fair and just reason to vacate their pleas.  No more was required.  Isom, 85 F.3d at 839 (failure to show good cause for withdrawal obviates prejudice-to-government inquiry).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The Arroyo Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time, Arroyo contends that the district court violated U.S.S.G. &#167; 6B1.1(c) by allowing him to plead guilty before it considered his presentence report (\"PSR\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  As Arroyo concedes, however, the failure to raise this claim below mandates \"plain error\" review.  See Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b);  see also United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The flaw in Arroyo's position is that he offers no reason for equating acceptance of his guilty plea with the acceptance of a plea agreement under &#167; 6B1.1(c).  See United States v. Ewing, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578220\"><a href=\"/opinion/578220/united-states-v-thomas-l-ewing/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 118 (4th Cir.)  (rejecting similar argument), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></span> (1992).  Arroyo entered a guilty plea on September 7, 1994, and, in accordance with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(e)(2) (permitting district court to defer decision to accept or reject Rule 11(e)(1)(C) plea agreements), the district court announced that its acceptance of the plea agreement was conditioned upon its review of the PSR.  See United States v. Johnson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695196\"><a href=\"/opinion/695196/united-states-v-arthur-r-johnson-aka-marcus-fuller/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span>, 832-33 (7th Cir.1995) (finding, on similar facts, that defendant had not been sentenced at Rule 11 hearing).  A PSR was submitted to the district court in timely fashion prior to sentencing on February 13, 1995.  At the sentencing, the district court found that the agreed sentence was within the applicable guideline range, see U.S.S.G &#167; 6B1.2(c)(1), accepted the plea agreement, see Ewing, 957 F.2d at 118, and imposed the sentence prescribed in the plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Arroyo has not squared his view of &#167; 6B1.1(c) with Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(3), which prohibits submission of a PSR until the defendant has pleaded or been found guilty, unless the defendant consents in writing.  The overarching purpose served by the PSR is to assist the district court at sentencing.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.1 &amp; Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(1) (requiring completed PSR \"before the sentence is imposed\").  Nor are we persuaded that the district court erred.  But see Olano, 507 U.S. at 732-33, 113 S.Ct. at 1776-77 (appellant must establish \"error\" under Rule 52(b)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we reject the frivolous argument that the indictment barred Arroyo from stipulating to the base offense level specified in the plea bargain.  Arroyo pled guilty to conspiring to distribute \"not less\" than fifty grams of cocaine base, five kilograms of cocaine, and one kilogram of heroin.  By its plain language, the indictment set no upper limit on drug quantity.  See United States v. Lindia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196710\"><a href=\"/opinion/196710/united-states-v-lindia/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1154</span></a></span>, 1159 n. 3 (1st Cir.1996) (indictment alleging drug dealing \"in excess\" of 50 kilograms did not bar sentence based on quantity greater than 50 kilograms).  Although Arroyo and several other appellants challenge the factual bases for the district court's drug quantity determinations as well, their stipulations to their base offense levels constitute admissions to the subsidiary drug quantities, see U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c) (determining base offense level according to drug quantity).  See Lindia, 82 F.3d at 1159-60, &amp; 1160 n. 3 (suggesting that guilty plea might preclude drug quantity challenge).  As the record otherwise discloses adequate factual support for the agreed-upon sentence, see Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(f) (accuracy of plea), and Arroyo's remaining arguments merit no discussion, we affirm the district court judgment against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case is remanded for further proceedings, consistent with this opinion, see supra pp. 22-23, on the merits of the pro se plea-withdrawal motion filed by Perez, as to which we express no opinion.  Notwithstanding our confidence in the district judge who presided over these proceedings, whose conduct of the other plea-withdrawal proceedings was exemplary, we direct that the Perez matter be assigned to a different judge on remand.  Mateo, 950 F.2d at 50 n. 10.   As the five remaining appellants have demonstrated no error in their plea-withdrawal proceedings, and their remaining arguments are meritless, the district court judgments relating to those defendants are affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <pre>APPENDIX A\n                        Withdrawal\nAppellant  Guilty Plea  Motion                 Reasons\nArroyo     9/07/94      12/27/94,              Didn't understand plea\n                          supplemented on        agreement; Rule 11 violations;\n                          1/09/95 and            claimed innocence.\n                          2/13/95.\nGarcia     9/07/94      11/28/94               Attorney coercion; thought it\n                                                 was all or none package deal;\n                                                 limited education.\nLopez      9/07/94      2/02/95                Mistakenly thought he had to\n                                                 plead guilty to both counts;\n                                                 innocent of firearms charge.\nQuintero   9/07/94      11/08/94               Attorney and familial coercion;\n                                                 innocent of firearms charge.\nSanchez    9/08/94      12/09/94               Attorney coercion; 18 years of\n                                                 age; preoccupied with federal\n                                                 carjacking trial; innocent of\n                                                 drug charge.</pre>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The record discloses cause for Aguayo's concerns for his client (and for the district court's concern as well) since upon conviction Perez would face a ninety-year minimum term of imprisonment, rather than the seventeen-year maximum term negotiated for him under the plea agreement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Were there any substance to Perez' allegations against Aguayo, a matter yet to be addressed by the district court, D.P.R.

See also id.   Rule 1.16(a)(1) (imposing duty to terminate representation).  In all events, at the outset of the plea-withdrawal hearing, Aguayo promptly indicated that he intended to withdraw as counsel.  The district court nonetheless proceeded with the hearing, took no action on Aguayo's withdrawal suggestion and, for all intents and purposes, continued to treat Aguayo as Perez' counsel, without first determining the disputed facts underlying the Perez allegations against Aguayo.  Thus, the linchpin to the ineffective assistance claim--whether Aguayo in fact labored under a conflict of interest--has yet to be subjected to factfinding</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> See Ramos, 810 F.2d at 313 (rejecting \"self-serving, unsupported claim of innocence raised judicially for the first time after the Rule 11 hearing\").
