Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Colleen E. Carafotes on brief for appellant.\r\n   Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and John M. Griffin,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJuly 20, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, it appears that only one of defendant's several issues\r\nwas raised below or preserved for appeal.  As to that issue\r\nconcerning a downward departure, the district court's decision,\r\nfairly read, was discretionary, and we lack jurisdiction to\r\nreview such a decision.  See United States v. Santos, 131 F.3d\r\n16, 21 (1st Cir. 1997).  In any event, the fact that\r\ndefendant's money laundering was not related to drug\r\ntrafficking or organized crime did not take it outside the\r\nheartland of money laundering offenses subject to U.S.S.G. \r\n2S1.1.  See United States v. Piero, 32 F.3d 611, 619-21 (1st\r\nCir. 1994).\r\n          The rest of defendant's issues were not raised before\r\nthe district court and so were waived for appeal.  See United\r\nStates v. LiCausi, 167 F.3d 36, 44-45 (1st Cir. 1999). \r\nNonetheless, we have reviewed those issues to the extent\r\npossible on the existing record, and we have found no plain\r\nerror that would lead us to disturb any part of the judgment. \r\nSee United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733-34 (1993).\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
