James H. Abernathy,\r                                                   \r\n\ndriving  a Massachusetts registered  car in Providence, Rhode\r\n\nIsland,  was stopped by two  policemen, one of  whom, when he\r\n\npeered into  defendant's vehicle, observed the butt  of a .45\r\n\ncaliber Colt  semi-automatic pistol  sticking out from  under\r\n\nthe driver's seat.  Indicted as a result, defendant initially\r\n\npleaded guilty to two counts:  Count I, as a convicted  felon\r\n\ncarrying a firearm that had  been in interstate commerce,  in\r\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C.   922(g)(1); Count II, carrying an arm\r\n\nthat  had been  in  interstate commerce  with an  obliterated\r\n\nserial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C.   922(k).  Defendant\r\n\nwas sentenced  to 110  months imprisonment followed  by three\r\n\nyears supervised release on  Count I, and to a  concurrent 60\r\n\nmonths imprisonment on Count  II.  Over one year  later, upon\r\n\ndefendant's motion, the entire  sentence was vacated in order\r\n\nto reinstate his right  to pursue a direct appeal,  which had\r\n\nbeen dismissed for want of prosecution.  Thereafter, prior to\r\n\nresentencing,  defendant moved  to  withdraw his  plea.   The\r\n\ncourt  denied the  motion  and resentenced  defendant to  the\r\n\noriginal terms.   This  appeal ensued, raising  the following\r\n\npoints: (1) the lawfulness of the stop; (2) whether defendant\r\n\nshould  have been  allowed  to  withdraw  his pleas  on  both\r\n\ncounts;  and  (3)  the  constitutionality  of   the  statutes\r\n\nproscribing his conduct.   We affirm on (1) and  (3).  On (2)\r\n\nwe reverse and vacate the sentence with respect to Count II.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n                          The Arrest\r                                                \r\n\n          The  officers were  in  an unmarked  car, in  plain\r\n\nclothes.   Some  of  the evidence  might support  defendant's\r\n\nclaim that this  was an unlawful  investigatory stop.   Ample\r\n\nevidence, however, supports the district court's finding of a\r\n\njustified  traffic violation  stop, including  testimony that\r\n\ndefendant travelled in the wrong lane of traffic and then ran\r\n\na stop sign.   No purpose would be  served in discussing  the\r\n\ndistrict court's careful  analysis and reasonable credibility\r\n\nresolutions.    The  fact  that  the   officers  were  on  an\r\n\nundercover  investigatory narcotics detail does not mean that\r\n\nthey could not lawfully make a proper traffic stop.\r\n\n                    Withdrawal of the Plea\r                                                      \r\n\n          Withdrawal of a guilty plea prior to sentencing may\r\n\nbe granted for \"fair and just  reason.\"  See Fed.

United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nAllard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1243 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                  \r\n\n          With respect to Count  I this is a routine  case --\r\n\nthe court  was well warranted in  finding no misunderstanding\r\n\nof the charge  by defendant, nor was there  any other flaw in\r\n\nthe plea proceedings.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(a)-(f).\r\n\n          There is a serious question, however,  with respect\r\n\nto Count II.  From the record, it appears that  the court, as\r\n\nwell  as counsel for  both the government  and the defendant,\r\n\nunderstood that  the government was not  obliged to establish\r\n\nactual knowledge  on defendant's part that  the serial number\r\n\nhad  been obliterated  at the  time of  his possession,1  and\r\n\ncommunicated this misunderstanding to the defendant.  We find\r\n\nthis  failure to  apprise defendant  of the  elements  of the\r\n\ncharge fundamentally  inconsistent with fair  procedure in an\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.

As the record contains strong\r\n\nsupport for defendant's claim that he lacked knowledge of the\r\n\nobliteration  -- at  the  very least  it  does not  establish\r\n\notherwise -- we cannot  say the error was harmless.   Compare\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v. Ferguson, 60 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995).

It  follows that  defendant has  a\r\n\nright to withdraw his plea on Count II.\r\n\n          Defendant's tangential suggestion that  the court's\r\n\nimposition of  a two-level  enhancement to his  offense level\r\n\nbased on the obliteration  also requires reversal ignores the\r\n\nfact that this enhancement explicitly applies \"whether or not\r\n\nthe  defendant knew or had reason to believe that the firearm\r\n\n. . .  had an  altered or obliterated  serial number.\"   USSG\r\n\n 2K2.1(b)(4), comment.

Indicted as a result, defendant initially pleaded guilty to two counts:  Count I, as a convicted felon carrying a firearm that had been in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1);  Count II, carrying an arm that had been in interstate commerce with an obliterated serial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k).

Over one year later, upon defendant's motion, the entire sentence was vacated in order to reinstate his right to pursue a direct appeal, which had been dismissed for want of prosecution.   Thereafter, prior to resentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea.   The court denied the motion and resentenced defendant to the original terms.

Abernathy, driving a Massachusetts registered car in Providence, Rhode Island, was stopped by two policemen, one of whom, when he peered into defendant's vehicle, observed the butt of a .45 caliber Colt semi-automatic pistol sticking out from under the driver's seat.   Indicted as a result, defendant initially pleaded guilty to two counts:  Count I, as a convicted felon carrying a firearm that had been in interstate commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1);  Count II, carrying an arm that had been in interstate commerce with an obliterated serial number, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k).   Defendant was sentenced to 110 months imprisonment followed by three years supervised release on Count I, and to a concurrent 60 months imprisonment on Count II.   Over one year later, upon defendant's motion, the entire sentence was vacated in order to reinstate his right to pursue a direct appeal, which had been dismissed for want of prosecution.   Thereafter, prior to resentencing, defendant moved to withdraw his plea.   The court denied the motion and resentenced defendant to the original terms.   This appeal ensued, raising the following points:  (1) the lawfulness of the stop;  (2) whether defendant should have been allowed to withdraw his pleas on both counts;  and (3) the constitutionality of the statutes proscribing his conduct.   We affirm on (1) and (3).   On (2) we reverse and vacate the sentence with respect to Count II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>The Arrest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers were in an unmarked car, in plain clothes.   Some of the evidence might support defendant's claim that this was an unlawful investigatory stop.   Ample evidence, however, supports the district court's finding of a justified traffic violation stop, including testimony that defendant travelled in the wrong lane of traffic and then ran a stop sign.   No purpose would be served in discussing the district court's careful analysis and reasonable credibility resolutions.   The fact that the officers were on an undercover investigatory narcotics detail does not mean that they could not lawfully make a proper traffic stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Withdrawal of the Plea</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Withdrawal of a guilty plea prior to sentencing may be granted for \"fair and just reason.\"   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(e) (1994);  United States v.

Although the United States attaches great significance to the category to which defendant ought to be assigned, whether defendant's plea was knowing and voluntary within the meaning of Criminal Rule 11 is the most significant factor under either standard.  United States v. Allard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556604\"><a href=\"/opinion/556604/united-states-v-raymond-p-allard/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span>, 1243 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Count I this is a routine case--the court was well warranted in finding no misunderstanding of the charge by defendant, nor was there any other flaw in the plea proceedings.

From the record, it appears that the court, as well as counsel for both the government and the defendant, understood that the government was not obliged to establish actual knowledge on defendant's part that the serial number had been obliterated at the time of his possession,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and communicated this misunderstanding to the defendant.   We find this failure to apprise defendant of the elements of the charge fundamentally inconsistent with fair procedure in an acceptance of plea proceeding.
