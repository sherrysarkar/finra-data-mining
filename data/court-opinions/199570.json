Pro se claimant Jorge Suárez-Maya\n\nappeals a district court judgment that orders the forfeiture\n\nof certain property to the government as the \"proceeds\" of\n\ndrug transactions, see 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(6), and requires\n\nthe government to pay claimant one third of the forfeiture\n\nsale's proceeds.       We have thoroughly reviewed the record and\n\nthe parties' briefs on appeal.              We vacate the forfeiture\n\njudgment   and    remand    for   further      proceedings     because    we\n\nconclude that claimant did not have fair notice that his\n\ntrial would begin less than twenty-four hours after he was\n\ntransferred      to   Puerto   Rico     from   the   federal   prison     in\n\nAllenwood, PA.        We address the parties' salient arguments.\n\nJurisdiction\n\n           We reject the parties's suggestion that this court\n\nlacks   jurisdiction       over   the   instant      appeal   because    the\n\nproperty   damage      claim   alleged    in    claimant's     \"Moción    En\n\nDemanda\", Docket #97, remained pending when the district\n\ncourt entered its forfeiture judgment on March 24, 2000.\n\nThis claim was not pending because it required no ruling.\n\nThe \"Moción En Demanda\" constituted an attempt to cure the\n\nlack-of-presentment defect that the district court identified\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f when it dismissed claimant's property damage claim under the\n\n Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and granted the government\n\n partial summary judgment. 1   Claimant had no right to bring\n\n suit on his property damage claim when he filed his \"Moción\n\n en Demanda\" because six months had not yet elapsed from the\n\n date of presentment suggested by his Standard Form 95 and the\n\n USMS had not administratively denied his claim.     Moreover,\n\n claimant never served his \"Moción en Demanda\" on opposing\n\n counsel.   Thus, the district court was required to do no more\n\n than \"note\" claimant's \"Moción En Demanda,\" as it did in its\n\n January 29, 1999 order, Docket #104.\n\n            We recognize that the trial judge purported to\n\n resurrect claimant's \"Moción En Demanda\" at the May 3, 2000\n\n hearing.    This action was a nullity.     By that time, the\n\n district court had lost jurisdiction over this case because\n\n the claimant had filed a valid notice of appeal, Docket #120,\n\n on February 28, 2000.   It is clear that claimant filed this\n\n notice to appeal from the decision that the district court\n\n\n\n    1  Claimant's \"Moción en Demanda\" included a Standard Form\n95 by which claimant purported to present his property damage\nclaim to the United States Marshal Service (USMS) in Hato Rey.\nClaimant obviously did this in response to the district court's\norder that dismissed his property damage claim based on\nclaimant's   failure   to  satisfy   the   FTCA's   presentment\nrequirement. See 28 U.S.C. § 2675(a).\n\n                               -4-\n\fannounced at the February 17, 2000 trial.                   See Becker v.\n\nMontgomery, 121 S.Ct. 1801, 1807 (2001).              The district court\n\nerred by failing to treat this document as a notice of\n\nappeal.       See, e.g., Hyche v. Christensen, 170 F.3d 769, 770\n\n(7th   Cir.    1999),   overruled    on    other    grounds   by    Lee   v.\n\nClinton, 209 F.3d 1025, 1027 (7th Cir. 2000); Dickerson v.\n\nMcClellan, 37 F.3d 251, 252 (6th Cir. 1994); 20 Moore's\n\nFederal Practice, §303.32[2][a][i] (3d ed. 1997).                  This was\n\nnot a case in which the claimant was trying to appeal an\n\nobviously unappealable order. Compare United States v. Mala,\n\n7 F.3d 1058, 1061 (1st Cir. 1993).           Rather, this was a case\n\nin which the claimant promptly filed a notice of appeal from\n\nrulings announced from the bench, as contemplated by Fed. R.\n\nApp. P. 4(a)(2)(\"a notice of appeal filed after the court\n\nannounces      a   decision   or   order   but     before   the   entry   of\n\njudgment ... shall be treated as if filed after such entry\n\nand on the date thereof[]\").         The district court clerk should\n\nhave recognized that although claimant filed his notice of\n\nappeal before judgment entered on March 24, 2000, the notice\n\nripened into effect on that date under Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(a)(2).       At that point, the clerk had the obligation to\n\nforward the notice of appeal and the docket entries to this\n\ncourt under Fed. R. App. P. 3(d)(1).\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f               Because   a   valid   notice    of    appeal     divests   the\n\n district court of jurisdiction over matters related to the\n\n appeal, see, e.g., Brandt v. Wand Partners, 242 F.3d 6, 14\n\n (1st Cir. 2001), the district court lacked jurisdiction to\n\n reopen the proceedings on the merits on May 3, 2000.                 Thus,\n\n orders issued with respect to claimant's property damage\n\n claim from that point on were a nullity.                 Accordingly, they\n\n do not defeat this court's jurisdiction.2\n\n The Merits\n\n               On appeal, claimant argues that the government\n\n failed   to    establish    probable      cause    for   the   forfeiture.3\n\n Alternatively, claimant contends that the district court\n\n deprived him of a fair opportunity to prepare and present his\n\n defense by requiring him to proceed with trial when he had\n\n\n    2   We pause to note that claimant's \"Moción En Demanda\" is\nin Spanish, as are a host of other documents that claimant filed\nin the district court. Claimant has failed to supply this court\nwith English translations of his Spanish documents as required\nby Local Rule 30(d). Ordinarily, we would hold that claimant\nhas waived any claim that is based on untranslated documents.\nSee, e.g., Ramos-Baez v. Bossolo-Lopez, 240 F.3d 92, 93-94 (1st\nCir. 2001); Lopez-Carrasquillo v. Rubianes, 230 F.3d 409, 413,\n414 & n. 3 (1 st Cir. 2000); Gonzales-Morales v. Hernandez-\nArencibia, 221 F.3d 45, 50 n. 4 (1st Cir. 2000). Here, however,\nthe record contains numerous documents that describe the\ncritical records in English.    Accordingly, we have relied on\nthese descriptions and hold that claimant has waived any claims\nthat call for a different translation.\n    3  We reject the government's suggestion that claimant did\nnot preserve this issue.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fnot been transferred to Puerto Rico in time to attend his\n\nfinal pretrial conference and further was not given notice\n\nthat his trial would begin on February 17, 2000.                 Claimant's\n\nfirst contention lacks merit, but we are compelled to agree\n\nwith his second point.\n\n              We conclude that the government has established\n\nprobable cause for the forfeiture.              To be sure, neither the\n\nstate   nor     the    federal     drug    offenses   identified      in   the\n\nverified forfeiture complaint could reasonably be thought to\n\nhave yielded the requisite \"proceeds.\" This is because these\n\noffenses were unsuccessful and too remote in time to the\n\nclaimant's      purchase      of     the    defendant      property   to    be\n\nreasonably thought to have funded it.               However, the evidence\n\nat claimant's federal trial disclosed that claimant admitted\n\nhis culpability in ferrying 16 kilograms of cocaine from Mona\n\nIsland to the main island of Puerto Rico and that he knew\n\nwhere an additional 250-270 kilograms was stashed on Mona\n\nIsland.       See United States v. Ramirez-Ferrer, 82 F.3d 1149\n\n(1st   Cir.    1996),    82   F.3d   1131    (1st   Cir.   1996)(en   banc),\n\nUnited States v. Ramirez-Ferrer, 1995 WESTLAW 237041 (1 st\n\nCir. 1995).           It is reasonable to conclude that someone\n\nentrusted with this amount of cocaine and knowledge was not\n\ncommitting his first drug offense in ten years (i.e., roughly\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f the amount of time between claimant's state and federal\n\n offenses). Rather, these circumstances suggest that claimant\n\n probably engaged in additional drug crimes that could have\n\n generated \"proceeds\" that at least partially funded his\n\n purchase of the defendant property.\n\n           Nevertheless, we are compelled to vacate and remand\n\n because the record discloses that claimant did not have fair\n\n notice that his trial would begin less than 24 hours after\n\n he arrived in Puerto Rico.      It is undisputed that claimant\n\n had notice of the district court order that first scheduled\n\n his trial for March 15, 2000.    Claimant further acknowledged\n\n that he had the court's February 1, 2000 order, which the\n\n district court construed as rescheduling claimant's trial for\n\n sometime between February 14-29, 2000.4    But the February 1 st\n\n order did not actually reschedule claimant's trial.     Rather,\n\n the final sentence of the order states, \"The non-jury trial,\n\n currently scheduled for MARCH 15, 2000 will be RESET for the\n\n period between FEBRUARY 14-29, 2000 by separate order.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied).   The remainder of the February 1 st order\n\n denied claimant's request for discovery, allowed claimant's\n\n\n\n    4   The February 1, 2000 order, Docket #115, was signed by\nJudge Cerezo on January 31, 2000.    Because the order was not\nentered until the following day, we refer to Docket #115 as the\n\"February 1st\" order.\n\n                              -8-\n\f motion to be transferred to Puerto Rico so that he could\n\n prepare for trial, ordered that claimant be transferred to\n\n Puerto Rico \"forthwith,\" and assigned the trial to a visiting\n\n judge.           The   February     1st   order   also      scheduled    a    status\n\n conference for February 11, 2000.\n\n                  We    think   it   clear       that   Judge    Cerezo       ordered\n\n claimant to be transferred to Puerto Rico \"forthwith\" so that\n\n he could attend the February 11th conference and have a\n\n modest amount of time in Puerto Rico to prepare for trial.\n\n But claimant was not transferred to Puerto Rico in time to\n\n attend the February 11th conference.                   Claimant's attendance\n\n at        this   conference       was     required     by    Fed.   R.   Civ.     P.\n\n 16(d)(providing that the final pretrial conference, \"shall\n\n be attended by ... any unrepresented parties.\" (emphasis\n\n supplied)).5           In accordance with the February 1st order, the\n\n trial judge issued a further scheduling order at the February\n\n 11th conference which advised the Assistant United States\n\n Attorney (AUSA) \"to be ready to go to trial any day after\n\n February 16, 2000.\"            There is no evidence that claimant was\n\n ever given notice of this third scheduling order.                        Thus, the\n\n record discloses that claimant arrived in Puerto Rico on the\n\n\n       5\n       Because of its close proximity to the trial, the February\n  th\n11   conference constituted a final pretrial conference that\nclaimant had the right to attend under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(d).\n\n                                           -9-\n\fevening of February 16th and that he was brought to court for\n\ntrial first thing in the morning on February 17th.                            But\n\nhaving missed the final pretrial conference, and lacking\n\nnotice   of    the    events   that      transpired        there,    claimant\n\nreasonably believed that his case remained scheduled for\n\ntrial on March 15th.\n\n           The   trial      judge   overlooked       the    fact    that      the\n\nFebruary 1st order did not actually reschedule the trial;\n\nrather, it stated that a separate order would issue that\n\nwould reschedule the trial.           The judge also overlooked the\n\nfact that because claimant had not been transferred to Puerto\n\nRico in time to attend the February 11th conference and was\n\nnot notified of the events that transpired there, he had no\n\nnotice of the order that the judge issued at the conference\n\nwhich resulted in the case being called for trial less than\n\n24 hours after claimant arrived in Puerto Rico.                Claimant was\n\nprejudiced by this chain of events.               Had he been transferred\n\nto    Puerto   Rico    in    time   to     attend     the    February         11 th\n\nconference, he would have had three days to line up his\n\nwitnesses and documents, for trial was then scheduled for\n\nFebruary 15th.       As it was, claimant had less than 24 hours.\n\nThe    trial   judge     recognized        that     claimant       was   at      a\n\ndisadvantage and endeavored to ameliorate the situation by\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fallowing a key witness, attorney Velez Rivera, to \"testify\"\n\nby speakerphone.         This was not sufficient.         Attorney Velez\n\nRivera was the only witness whom the claimant identified who\n\nappeared    to    have     personal   knowledge      of   many    of     the\n\ncircumstances      surrounding    claimant's       sale   of   his     other\n\nproperty.     Claimant was entitled to have a fair opportunity\n\nto bring attorney Velez Rivera, and any others witnesses who\n\ncould offer admissible evidence to support his claims, into\n\ncourt to testify.\n\n            In view of the foregoing, we think that the trial\n\njudge abused his discretion in concluding that claimant had\n\nfair notice of the trial date from the court's February 1,\n\n2000 order.      See, e.g., Casa Maria Hogar Geriatrico, Inc. v.\n\nRivera-Santis, 38 F.3d 615, 618 (1st Cir. 1994).                 We reject\n\nthe   government's       suggestion   that   the    claimant      was    not\n\nprejudiced by the foregoing course of events because he was\n\ngiven a second opportunity to present evidence at the May 3,\n\n2000 hearing.       For one thing, the notice that the court\n\nissued in scheduling that hearing described it as a hearing\n\non claimant's motion to stay the forfeiture sale.                It is not\n\nclear that claimant was told that he was going to get a\n\nsecond bite at the apple.         More importantly, by that time,\n\nthe court had no jurisdiction to offer such a bite, because\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe claimant had filed a valid notice of appeal.           Thus, the\n\nMay 3rd hearing was not a sufficient cure for the inadequate\n\nnotice that preceded the trial.\n\n             Since claimant unquestionably suffered prejudice,\n\nconsiderations of basic fairness dictate that we grant a new\n\ntrial.      Moreover, we are greatly concerned that the record\n\non appeal fails to indicate that the government ever provided\n\nthe district court with an explanation for its sixteen-day\n\ndelay in returning claimant to Puerto Rico (to enable him to\n\nprepare for trial), notwithstanding the explicit directive\n\nin   the    district   court's    February   1st   order   that    the\n\ngovernment do so \"forthwith.\"      Although the record obliquely\n\nsuggests that claimant may have required hospitalization\n\nduring this time, it was incumbent upon the government to\n\naccount for the seemingly inordinate delay, especially since\n\nits deferment deprived claimant of the right to attend the\n\npivotal February 11 status conference.\n\n             Where the claimant in a civil forfeiture proceeding\n\nis in federal custody and has not been made available in due\n\ncourse for trial, the district court should determine the\n\nreason for the tardy transfer.          Should the district court\n\ndetermine that there was government mischief or manipulation,\n\nor   that    the   explanation   proffered   for    the    delay   was\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\funsubstantiated or manifestly pretextual, it must exercise\n\nits discretion by imposing a sanction commensurate with the\n\nseriousness       of    the   misfeasance.       Any   such    sanction        may\n\ninclude     the    dismissal,        with    prejudice,       of   the     civil\n\nforfeiture complaint should the circumstances warrant.                         See\n\nFernandez    v.        Leonard,    963   F.2d   459,    462-63      (1st      Cir.\n\n1992)(noting that dismissal is potential sanction for \"fraud\n\non the court,\" defined to include any \"unconscionable scheme\n\ncalculated to ... unfairly hamper[] the presentation of the\n\nopposing party's claim or defense.\")(citation omitted).                         Of\n\ncourse, it is for the district court to determine in the\n\nfirst instance what, if any, sanction may be appropriate in\n\nthe circumstances.\n\n            The district court should proceed with its retrial\n\nof the forfeiture action only after it has made an explicit\n\nruling on the government's explanation for the delay in\n\ntransfer, and          it has determined in its discretion that the\n\nultimate    sanction          of   dismissal    is   unwarranted         in   the\n\ncircumstances.          At that juncture, the district court should\n\nprovide claimant adequate notice of the retrial date, as well\n\nas a reasonable time and opportunity to prepare for the\n\nretrial, to arrange for the court appearances of all material\n\nwitnesses, and for the translation of important documents\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f(e.g.,     deeds    of    sale)   which    purportedly   substantiate\n\nclaimant's defense.\n\n            While    we   need    not   reach   claimant's   remaining\n\narguments, we add the following comments to clarify certain\n\nmatters which could arise on remand should the district court\n\ndetermine that dismissal of the forfeiture complaint is not\n\nwarranted.     First, claimant cannot benefit from the Civil\n\nAsset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 because this law applies\n\nonly to cases that were commenced on or after August 23,\n\n2000.    See, e.g., United States v. Real Property Located at\n\n221 Dana Avenue, Hyde Park, MA, No. 00-1665, slip op. at 2,\n\nn.1 (1st Cir. Aug. 17, 2001);             United States v.    Quintana-\n\nAguayo, 235 F.3d 682, 687 n.9 (1st Cir. 2000).           Under the law\n\nthat governs this case, the government may use reliable\n\nhearsay to satisfy its burden of proving probable cause, but\n\nthe claimant cannot rely on hearsay to rebut the government's\n\nshowing. See United States v. One Lot of Currency ($68,000),\n\n927 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1991)(forfeiture claimant \"must\n\nproduce evidence which would be admissible at trial\" in\n\nopposing    the    government's    motion    for   summary   judgment).\n\nClaimant must do more than proffer possible innocent (i.e.,\n\nnon-drug related) sources of income to rebut the government's\n\ncase.    See United States v. Parcels of Property, 9 F.3d 1000,\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f 1005 (1st Cir. 1993).      Rather, claimant must prove that non-\n\n drug money funded his purchase of the defendant property by\n\n a preponderance of the evidence.            See United States v.\n\n Parcels of Land, 903 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1990).6\n\n            Second,   the    district     court    did   not   err   by\n\n disregarding the alleged legitimate sources of income that\n\n claimant identified at his trial and in his prior deposition.\n\n Absent evidence corroborating same, the district court was\n\n not obliged to credit claimant's trial testimony regarding\n\n his alleged sale of a boat.            Claimant also is under the\n\n mistaken   impression   that    the    entire    transcript   of    his\n\n deposition is part of the record.          It is not.     It is the\n\n responsibility of the claimant, not the district court, to\n\n identify evidence in support of his claims.         See Ruiz Rivera\n\n v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 27-28 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2000); Local\n\n Rule 311.12.7   The district court also did not err by relying\n\n\n    6   Although we need not reach the issue, we note that the\ntestimony of Mrs. Sor Carrera Rodriguez regarding claimant's\nalleged bolíta winnings was hearsay; therefore it added nothing\nto claimant's case.\n    7  On appeal, claimant argues that he earned between $4000-\n$5000 every three months from growing pumpkins and watermelons\non his property.   However, claimant failed to bring the page\nfrom his deposition that supports this claim to the attention of\nthe district court. Claimant's motion to take judicial notice\nis denied insofar as it seeks to add this page to the record on\nappeal. The remaining items addressed in that motion are part\nof the record which we have reviewed; therefore there is no need\n\n                                 -15-\n\f on the fact that claimant did not file tax returns in\n\n reaching its decision.          The fact that claimant's alleged\n\n income    sources   are   not   corroborated   by   tax   returns   is\n\n relevant even if claimant's failure to file tax returns did\n\n not violate Puerto Rico law (a matter on which we express no\n\n opinion). 8   Finally, the district court did not err in its\n\n treatment of Magistrate-Judge Delgado-Colon's June 17, 1998\n\n report.\n\n            In view of the foregoing, the judgment of the\n\n district court      is vacated and the case is remanded for\n\n further\n\n proceedings consistent with this opinion.           See Local Rule\n\n 27(c).\n\n\n\n\nfor claimant to seek judicial notice of these documents. The\nsuggestion in claimant's reply brief that his October 27, 1998\ncomplaint, Docket #98, remains pending is waived because\nclaimant did not present this claim clearly in his opening\nbrief. See, e.g., United States v. Coviello, 225 F.3d 54, 70\nn.10 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 839 (2001).\n    8   The record of the May 3, 2000 hearing indicates that the\ntrial judge gave claimant the benefit of the doubt on this\nissue. We assume that this means that he credited claimant's\ncontention that independent fisherman are not required to file\ntax returns in Puerto Rico. Even if this is so, it does not\nhelp claimant's case.     If claimant fails to corroborate his\nclaims regarding the non-drug related sources of income that he\nhas identified, the district court may rely on this fact on\nremand.\n\n                                  -16-\n\f-17-\n\f",

Pro se claimant Jorge Suárez-Maya\n\nappeals a district court judgment that orders the forfeiture\n\nof certain property to the government as the \"proceeds\" of\n\ndrug transactions, see 21 U.S.C. § 881(a)(6), and requires\n\nthe government to pay claimant one third of the forfeiture\n\nsale's proceeds.       We have thoroughly reviewed the record and\n\nthe parties' briefs on appeal.              We vacate the forfeiture\n\njudgment   and    remand    for   further      proceedings     because    we\n\nconclude that claimant did not have fair notice that his\n\ntrial would begin less than twenty-four hours after he was\n\ntransferred      to   Puerto   Rico     from   the   federal   prison     in\n\nAllenwood, PA.        We address the parties' salient arguments.\n\nJurisdiction\n\n           We reject the parties's suggestion that this court\n\nlacks   jurisdiction       over   the   instant      appeal   because    the\n\nproperty   damage      claim   alleged    in    claimant's     \"Moción    En\n\nDemanda\", Docket #97, remained pending when the district\n\ncourt entered its forfeiture judgment on March 24, 2000.\n\nThis claim was not pending because it required no ruling.\n\nThe \"Moción En Demanda\" constituted an attempt to cure the\n\nlack-of-presentment defect that the district court identified\n\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f when it dismissed claimant's property damage claim under the\n\n Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) and granted the government\n\n partial summary judgment. 1   Claimant had no right to bring\n\n suit on his property damage claim when he filed his \"Moción\n\n en Demanda\" because six months had not yet elapsed from the\n\n date of presentment suggested by his Standard Form 95 and the\n\n USMS had not administratively denied his claim.     Moreover,\n\n claimant never served his \"Moción en Demanda\" on opposing\n\n counsel.   Thus, the district court was required to do no more\n\n than \"note\" claimant's \"Moción En Demanda,\" as it did in its\n\n January 29, 1999 order, Docket #104.\n\n            We recognize that the trial judge purported to\n\n resurrect claimant's \"Moción En Demanda\" at the May 3, 2000\n\n hearing.    This action was a nullity.     By that time, the\n\n district court had lost jurisdiction over this case because\n\n the claimant had filed a valid notice of appeal, Docket #120,\n\n on February 28, 2000.   It is clear that claimant filed this\n\n notice to appeal from the decision that the district court\n\n\n\n    1  Claimant's \"Moción en Demanda\" included a Standard Form\n95 by which claimant purported to present his property damage\nclaim to the United States Marshal Service (USMS) in Hato Rey.\nClaimant obviously did this in response to the district court's\norder that dismissed his property damage claim based on\nclaimant's   failure   to  satisfy   the   FTCA's   presentment\nrequirement.

The district court clerk should\n\nhave recognized that although claimant filed his notice of\n\nappeal before judgment entered on March 24, 2000, the notice\n\nripened into effect on that date under Fed.

Here, however,\nthe record contains numerous documents that describe the\ncritical records in English.    Accordingly, we have relied on\nthese descriptions and hold that claimant has waived any claims\nthat call for a different translation.\n    3  We reject the government's suggestion that claimant did\nnot preserve this issue.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fnot been transferred to Puerto Rico in time to attend his\n\nfinal pretrial conference and further was not given notice\n\nthat his trial would begin on February 17, 2000.                 Claimant's\n\nfirst contention lacks merit, but we are compelled to agree\n\nwith his second point.\n\n              We conclude that the government has established\n\nprobable cause for the forfeiture.              To be sure, neither the\n\nstate   nor     the    federal     drug    offenses   identified      in   the\n\nverified forfeiture complaint could reasonably be thought to\n\nhave yielded the requisite \"proceeds.\" This is because these\n\noffenses were unsuccessful and too remote in time to the\n\nclaimant's      purchase      of     the    defendant      property   to    be\n\nreasonably thought to have funded it.               However, the evidence\n\nat claimant's federal trial disclosed that claimant admitted\n\nhis culpability in ferrying 16 kilograms of cocaine from Mona\n\nIsland to the main island of Puerto Rico and that he knew\n\nwhere an additional 250-270 kilograms was stashed on Mona\n\nIsland.

Ramirez-Ferrer, 1995 WESTLAW 237041 (1 st\n\nCir. 1995).           It is reasonable to conclude that someone\n\nentrusted with this amount of cocaine and knowledge was not\n\ncommitting his first drug offense in ten years (i.e., roughly\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f the amount of time between claimant's state and federal\n\n offenses). Rather, these circumstances suggest that claimant\n\n probably engaged in additional drug crimes that could have\n\n generated \"proceeds\" that at least partially funded his\n\n purchase of the defendant property.\n\n           Nevertheless, we are compelled to vacate and remand\n\n because the record discloses that claimant did not have fair\n\n notice that his trial would begin less than 24 hours after\n\n he arrived in Puerto Rico.      It is undisputed that claimant\n\n had notice of the district court order that first scheduled\n\n his trial for March 15, 2000.    Claimant further acknowledged\n\n that he had the court's February 1, 2000 order, which the\n\n district court construed as rescheduling claimant's trial for\n\n sometime between February 14-29, 2000.4    But the February 1 st\n\n order did not actually reschedule claimant's trial.     Rather,\n\n the final sentence of the order states, \"The non-jury trial,\n\n currently scheduled for MARCH 15, 2000 will be RESET for the\n\n period between FEBRUARY 14-29, 2000 by separate order.\"\n\n (emphasis supplied).   The remainder of the February 1 st order\n\n denied claimant's request for discovery, allowed claimant's\n\n\n\n    4   The February 1, 2000 order, Docket #115, was signed by\nJudge Cerezo on January 31, 2000.    Because the order was not\nentered until the following day, we refer to Docket #115 as the\n\"February 1st\" order.\n\n                              -8-\n\f motion to be transferred to Puerto Rico so that he could\n\n prepare for trial, ordered that claimant be transferred to\n\n Puerto Rico \"forthwith,\" and assigned the trial to a visiting\n\n judge.           The   February     1st   order   also      scheduled    a    status\n\n conference for February 11, 2000.\n\n                  We    think   it   clear       that   Judge    Cerezo       ordered\n\n claimant to be transferred to Puerto Rico \"forthwith\" so that\n\n he could attend the February 11th conference and have a\n\n modest amount of time in Puerto Rico to prepare for trial.\n\n But claimant was not transferred to Puerto Rico in time to\n\n attend the February 11th conference.                   Claimant's attendance\n\n at        this   conference       was     required     by    Fed.   R.   Civ.     P.\n\n 16(d)(providing that the final pretrial conference, \"shall\n\n be attended by ... any unrepresented parties.\" (emphasis\n\n supplied)).5           In accordance with the February 1st order, the\n\n trial judge issued a further scheduling order at the February\n\n 11th conference which advised the Assistant United States\n\n Attorney (AUSA) \"to be ready to go to trial any day after\n\n February 16, 2000.\"            There is no evidence that claimant was\n\n ever given notice of this third scheduling order.                        Thus, the\n\n record discloses that claimant arrived in Puerto Rico on the\n\n\n       5\n       Because of its close proximity to the trial, the February\n  th\n11   conference constituted a final pretrial conference that\nclaimant had the right to attend under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(d).\n\n                                           -9-\n\fevening of February 16th and that he was brought to court for\n\ntrial first thing in the morning on February 17th.                            But\n\nhaving missed the final pretrial conference, and lacking\n\nnotice   of    the    events   that      transpired        there,    claimant\n\nreasonably believed that his case remained scheduled for\n\ntrial on March 15th.\n\n           The   trial      judge   overlooked       the    fact    that      the\n\nFebruary 1st order did not actually reschedule the trial;\n\nrather, it stated that a separate order would issue that\n\nwould reschedule the trial.           The judge also overlooked the\n\nfact that because claimant had not been transferred to Puerto\n\nRico in time to attend the February 11th conference and was\n\nnot notified of the events that transpired there, he had no\n\nnotice of the order that the judge issued at the conference\n\nwhich resulted in the case being called for trial less than\n\n24 hours after claimant arrived in Puerto Rico.                Claimant was\n\nprejudiced by this chain of events.               Had he been transferred\n\nto    Puerto   Rico    in    time   to     attend     the    February         11 th\n\nconference, he would have had three days to line up his\n\nwitnesses and documents, for trial was then scheduled for\n\nFebruary 15th.       As it was, claimant had less than 24 hours.\n\nThe    trial   judge     recognized        that     claimant       was   at      a\n\ndisadvantage and endeavored to ameliorate the situation by\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fallowing a key witness, attorney Velez Rivera, to \"testify\"\n\nby speakerphone.         This was not sufficient.         Attorney Velez\n\nRivera was the only witness whom the claimant identified who\n\nappeared    to    have     personal   knowledge      of   many    of     the\n\ncircumstances      surrounding    claimant's       sale   of   his     other\n\nproperty.     Claimant was entitled to have a fair opportunity\n\nto bring attorney Velez Rivera, and any others witnesses who\n\ncould offer admissible evidence to support his claims, into\n\ncourt to testify.\n\n            In view of the foregoing, we think that the trial\n\njudge abused his discretion in concluding that claimant had\n\nfair notice of the trial date from the court's February 1,\n\n2000 order.

We reject\n\nthe   government's       suggestion   that   the    claimant      was    not\n\nprejudiced by the foregoing course of events because he was\n\ngiven a second opportunity to present evidence at the May 3,\n\n2000 hearing.       For one thing, the notice that the court\n\nissued in scheduling that hearing described it as a hearing\n\non claimant's motion to stay the forfeiture sale.                It is not\n\nclear that claimant was told that he was going to get a\n\nsecond bite at the apple.         More importantly, by that time,\n\nthe court had no jurisdiction to offer such a bite, because\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe claimant had filed a valid notice of appeal.           Thus, the\n\nMay 3rd hearing was not a sufficient cure for the inadequate\n\nnotice that preceded the trial.\n\n             Since claimant unquestionably suffered prejudice,\n\nconsiderations of basic fairness dictate that we grant a new\n\ntrial.      Moreover, we are greatly concerned that the record\n\non appeal fails to indicate that the government ever provided\n\nthe district court with an explanation for its sixteen-day\n\ndelay in returning claimant to Puerto Rico (to enable him to\n\nprepare for trial), notwithstanding the explicit directive\n\nin   the    district   court's    February   1st   order   that    the\n\ngovernment do so \"forthwith.\"      Although the record obliquely\n\nsuggests that claimant may have required hospitalization\n\nduring this time, it was incumbent upon the government to\n\naccount for the seemingly inordinate delay, especially since\n\nits deferment deprived claimant of the right to attend the\n\npivotal February 11 status conference.\n\n             Where the claimant in a civil forfeiture proceeding\n\nis in federal custody and has not been made available in due\n\ncourse for trial, the district court should determine the\n\nreason for the tardy transfer.          Should the district court\n\ndetermine that there was government mischief or manipulation,\n\nor   that    the   explanation   proffered   for    the    delay   was\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\funsubstantiated or manifestly pretextual, it must exercise\n\nits discretion by imposing a sanction commensurate with the\n\nseriousness       of    the   misfeasance.       Any   such    sanction        may\n\ninclude     the    dismissal,        with    prejudice,       of   the     civil\n\nforfeiture complaint should the circumstances warrant.                         See\n\nFernandez    v.        Leonard,    </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583332\"><a href=\"/opinion/583332/oscar-j-fernandez-v-francis-t-leonard/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>   <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,    462-63      (1st      Cir.\n\n1992)(noting that dismissal is potential sanction for \"fraud\n\non the court,\" defined to include any \"unconscionable scheme\n\ncalculated to ... unfairly hamper[] the presentation of the\n\nopposing party's claim or defense.\")(citation omitted).                         Of\n\ncourse, it is for the district court to determine in the\n\nfirst instance what, if any, sanction may be appropriate in\n\nthe circumstances.\n\n            The district court should proceed with its retrial\n\nof the forfeiture action only after it has made an explicit\n\nruling on the government's explanation for the delay in\n\ntransfer, and          it has determined in its discretion that the\n\nultimate    sanction          of   dismissal    is   unwarranted         in   the\n\ncircumstances.          At that juncture, the district court should\n\nprovide claimant adequate notice of the retrial date, as well\n\nas a reasonable time and opportunity to prepare for the\n\nretrial, to arrange for the court appearances of all material\n\nwitnesses, and for the translation of important documents\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f(e.g.,     deeds    of    sale)   which    purportedly   substantiate\n\nclaimant's defense.\n\n            While    we   need    not   reach   claimant's   remaining\n\narguments, we add the following comments to clarify certain\n\nmatters which could arise on remand should the district court\n\ndetermine that dismissal of the forfeiture complaint is not\n\nwarranted.     First, claimant cannot benefit from the Civil\n\nAsset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 because this law applies\n\nonly to cases that were commenced on or after August 23,\n\n2000.    See, e.g., United States v. Real Property Located at\n\n221 Dana Avenue, Hyde Park, MA, No. 00-1665, slip op. at 2,\n\nn.1 (1st Cir. Aug. 17, 2001);             United States v.

Under the law\n\nthat governs this case, the government may use reliable\n\nhearsay to satisfy its burden of proving probable cause, but\n\nthe claimant cannot rely on hearsay to rebut the government's\n\nshowing. See United States v. One Lot of Currency ($68,000),\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556639\"><a href=\"/opinion/556639/united-states-v-one-lot-of-us-currency-68000-etc-giovanni/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 32 (1st Cir. 1991)(forfeiture claimant \"must\n\nproduce evidence which would be admissible at trial\" in\n\nopposing    the    government's    motion    for   summary   judgment).\n\nClaimant must do more than proffer possible innocent (i.e.,\n\nnon-drug related) sources of income to rebut the government's\n\ncase.    See United States v. Parcels of Property, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195052\"><a href=\"/opinion/195052/united-states-v-parcels-of-property/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f 1005 (1st Cir. 1993).      Rather, claimant must prove that non-\n\n drug money funded his purchase of the defendant property by\n\n a preponderance of the evidence.            See United States v.\n\n Parcels of Land, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541731\"><a href=\"/opinion/541731/united-states-v-parcels-of-land-etc-appeal-of-lionel-laliberte/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 38 (1st Cir. 1990).6\n\n            Second,   the    district     court    did   not   err   by\n\n disregarding the alleged legitimate sources of income that\n\n claimant identified at his trial and in his prior deposition.\n\n Absent evidence corroborating same, the district court was\n\n not obliged to credit claimant's trial testimony regarding\n\n his alleged sale of a boat.            Claimant also is under the\n\n mistaken   impression   that    the    entire    transcript   of    his\n\n deposition is part of the record.          It is not.     It is the\n\n responsibility of the claimant, not the district court, to\n\n identify evidence in support of his claims.         See Ruiz Rivera\n\n v. Riley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198879\"><a href=\"/opinion/198879/ruiz-rivera-v-dept-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27-28 & n.2 (1st Cir. 2000); Local\n\n Rule 311.12.7   The district court also did not err by relying\n\n\n    6   Although we need not reach the issue, we note that the\ntestimony of Mrs. Sor Carrera Rodriguez regarding claimant's\nalleged bolíta winnings was hearsay; therefore it added nothing\nto claimant's case.\n    7  On appeal, claimant argues that he earned between $4000-\n$5000 every three months from growing pumpkins and watermelons\non his property.   However, claimant failed to bring the page\nfrom his deposition that supports this claim to the attention of\nthe district court. Claimant's motion to take judicial notice\nis denied insofar as it seeks to add this page to the record on\nappeal. The remaining items addressed in that motion are part\nof the record which we have reviewed; therefore there is no need\n\n                                 -15-\n\f on the fact that claimant did not file tax returns in\n\n reaching its decision.          The fact that claimant's alleged\n\n income    sources   are   not   corroborated   by   tax   returns   is\n\n relevant even if claimant's failure to file tax returns did\n\n not violate Puerto Rico law (a matter on which we express no\n\n opinion). 8   Finally, the district court did not err in its\n\n treatment of Magistrate-Judge Delgado-Colon's June 17, 1998\n\n report.\n\n            In view of the foregoing, the judgment of the\n\n district court      is vacated and the case is remanded for\n\n further\n\n proceedings consistent with this opinion.           See Local Rule\n\n 27(c).\n\n\n\n\nfor claimant to seek judicial notice of these documents. The\nsuggestion in claimant's reply brief that his October 27, 1998\ncomplaint, Docket #98, remains pending is waived because\nclaimant did not present this claim clearly in his opening\nbrief. See, e.g., United States v. Coviello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199074\"><a href=\"/opinion/199074/united-states-v-coviello/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 70\nn.10 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We assume that this means that he credited claimant's\ncontention that independent fisherman are not required to file\ntax returns in Puerto Rico. Even if this is so, it does not\nhelp claimant's case.     If claimant fails to corroborate his\nclaims regarding the non-drug related sources of income that he\nhas identified, the district court may rely on this fact on\nremand.\n\n                                  -16-\n\f-17-\n\f</pre>",
