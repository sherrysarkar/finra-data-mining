Leavey, Assistant U.S. Attorney,\r                                                    \r\non Appellee's Motion to  Dismiss For Failure to Obtain  Certificate of\r\nAppealability and To  Vacate the  Order Requiring Appellee  to File  A\r\nBrief.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                      November 13, 1996\r\n                                         \r\r\n\n     Per Curiam.  Upon  careful review of petitioner's brief,\r                           \r\n\nthe  government's  motion  to  dismiss, and  the  record,  we\r\n\nconclude   that   the   district   court   correctly   denied\r\n\npetitioner's  motion.     For  the  reasons   stated  in  the\r\n\nmagistrate judge's report and  recommendation, we agree  that\r\n\npetitioner  did   not  sustain   his  claim   of  ineffective\r\n\nassistance  of counsel during sentencing.   We add only these\r\n\ncomments.\r\n\n     1.   The  government asserts that  this appeal should be\r\n\ndismissed  because   petitioner  has  failed   to  obtain   a\r\n\ncertificate of  appealability as  required  under the  recent\r\n\nhabeas  amendments,  the  Antiterrorism and  Effective  Death\r\n\nPenalty Act of 1996,  Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat.  1214 (April\r\n\n24, 1996).   There is some uncertainty  about the application\r\n\nof  those amendments  to  this proceeding,  but  we need  not\r\n\nresolve it here.  The result of this appeal would be the same\r\n\nunder  any  analysis:    we  would  deny   a  certificate  of\r\n\nappealability were  one required, and we  also have concluded\r\n\nthat  the  district court  order  should be  affirmed  on the\r\n\nmerits.   Hence, we  do not address  the government's motion.\r\n\nSee United  States v. Connell,  6 F.3d 27,  29 n.3 (1st  Cir.\r                                         \r\n\n1993) (forgoing resolution of a jurisdictional question where\r\n\nan uncomplicated  appeal is easily  resolved in favor  of the\r\n\nparty challenging jurisdiction).  \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n     2.   For  the  first  time  in this  appeal,  petitioner\r\n\ncontends that his attorney provided ineffective assistance by\r\n\nfailing  to appeal  from the  sentencing court's  decision to\r\n\naccept certain facts stated in the presentence report.   That\r\n\nissue was not mentioned in petitioner's   2255 motion and was\r\n\nnot  ruled  on by  the  district court,  and so  we  will not\r\n\nconsider it.   See  United States   v. La  Guardia, 902  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n1010, 1013 (1st Cir.  1990) (issues not raised below  will be\r\n\nconsidered on appeal only in exceptional cases). \r\n\n     3.   Similarly,  we do  not  consider the  new affidavit\r\n\nattached to petitioner's brief,  because it was not presented\r\n\nto the district court.\r\n\n     For  the foregoing  reasons,  we need  not consider  the\r\n\ngovernment's motion  to dismiss this  appeal and to  vacate a\r\n\nbriefing order.\r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
