In this interlocutory appeal,\n\ndefendant-appellant Joel Keene beseeches us to reverse an order\n\nof the district court refusing to dismiss an indictment                        on\n\ndouble jeopardy grounds.           The appellant asseverates that the\n\ndistrict    court   should    have      acknowledged     that   it    acted    too\n\nhastily in declaring a mistrial, over the appellant's objection,\n\ninstead    of   exhorting    the   jury       to   deliberate   further,      and,\n\naccordingly,      should    have   barred      further   prosecution    of    the\n\ncharges against him.        Finding this asseveration unpersuasive, we\n\naffirm the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            A federal grand jury sitting in the District of Maine\n\nindicted    the     appellant      on    drug-trafficking       and    criminal\n\nforfeiture charges.        See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 853.            Trial on\n\nthe drug-trafficking counts commenced on June 25, 2001.                         By\n\nearly afternoon, the government had completed its case in chief.\n\nThe court adjourned at that juncture.                The jurors returned the\n\nnext morning and the appellant began to present his defense.\n\nLater that day, the appellant rested, the attorneys made their\n\nclosing arguments, and the court charged the jury.\n\n            The jurors began deliberating at approximately 1:00\n\np.m. on June 26.      Shortly thereafter they sent the judge a note.\n\nFinding the note opaque, the judge conferred with counsel.                      An\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fexchange of notes followed, punctuated by periodic conferences\n\nbetween    the    judge    and    the   lawyers.      Eventually,      the    jury\n\nrequested that certain testimony be read back.                   After again\n\nconferring with counsel, the judge acceded to the request but\n\nlimited the scope of the read-back.                The jury then retired to\n\ncontinue its deliberations.\n\n            Within a relatively short time, the foreperson informed\n\nthe court that the members of the jury could not agree upon a\n\nverdict.         The   judge     consulted     with   counsel,   who    jointly\n\nsuggested that the jurors be allowed to go home for the day and\n\nresume deliberations the next morning.                 Concerned that this\n\ncourse of action, unexplained, might lead jurors to conclude\n\nthat they would be obliged to deliberate indefinitely, the judge\n\ntold the lawyers that he preferred to provide the jurors with\n\ninstructions of the sort customarily given to deadlocked juries\n\nand offer them the opportunity to choose between going home or\n\ncontinuing their deliberations.               The attorneys agreed to this\n\nproposal.\n\n            The    judge    thereupon     returned     the   jurors     to     the\n\ncourtroom and gave a modified Allen charge.              See Allen v. United\n\nStates, 164 U.S. 492, 501 (1896).              He concluded his remarks by\n\npresenting the jurors with a choice of how to proceed.                       After\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fwhispered consultations in the jury box, the foreperson advised\n\nthe court that the jurors wished to continue deliberating.\n\n           Approximately an hour and a half later — at 6:22 p.m.\n\n— the jurors sent a note to the judge, reporting that they were\n\n\"truly deadlocked.\"       To emphasize the point, the foreperson\n\nunderlined a word fragment in the phrase \"cannot come to a\n\nunanimous decision.\"     The judge conferred with counsel, and all\n\nparties concurred that it would be premature to abandon hope for\n\na unanimous verdict.     The judge, with the lawyers' approbation,\n\nagreed to send the jurors home and bring them back the next\n\nmorning to resume deliberations.         However, defense counsel asked\n\nfor something more:      a supplemental instruction that would in\n\nessence amount to a second modified Allen charge.               The judge\n\ndemurred, citing this court's decision           in   United States v.\n\nBarone, 114 F.3d 1284, 1305 (1st Cir. 1997), and dismissed the\n\njury for the day without giving the requested instruction.\n\n           The jurors reconvened on June 27.         Almost immediately,\n\nthey   asked   that   additional   testimony    be   read   back.   After\n\nsoliciting the attorneys' views and engaging in an exchange of\n\nnotes with the jury, the court permitted a read-back of certain\n\ntestimony.     The jury retired to continue its deliberations at\n\nabout 10:44 a.m.      Around noontime, the jurors transmitted yet\n\nanother note to the judge declaring that \"we cannot come to a\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\funanimous decision\" (emphasis in the original).       This time, each\n\njuror signed the communiqué.\n\n            The judge promptly conferred with counsel. The defense\n\nattorney renewed his request for a second modified Allen charge.\n\nThe judge denied the request, explaining that the case did not\n\npresent special circumstances of a type or kind that would\n\nwarrant such an unusual measure.        Instead, the judge sent the\n\njury a note inquiring whether there was any possibility that, in\n\ntime, it might arrive at a unanimous decision on either of the\n\ntwo counts.    In a reply note, the jury responded in the negative\n\n(again     emphasizing   the   word   fragment   \"not\").   Over   the\n\nappellant's objection, the judge declared the jury hopelessly\n\ndeadlocked and ordered a mistrial.\n\n            In due course, the appellant moved to dismiss the\n\nindictment, arguing that a retrial would offend the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause.    The district court wrote a thoughtful rescript\n\nin which it denied the motion.        United States v. Keene, 158 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 93, 95 (D. Me. 2001).           This interlocutory appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nII.     ANALYSIS\n\n            Under ordinary circumstances, a defendant cannot take\n\nan immediate appeal from an interlocutory order in a criminal\n\ncase.      There is a well-recognized exception, however, that\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fmaterializes when the defendant is able to mount a colorable\n\nclaim     that    further    proceedings        in   the   trial   court   will\n\nconstitute double jeopardy.              See Abney v. United States, 431\n\nU.S. 651, 662 (1977); United States v. Stoller, 78 F.3d 710, 714\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).         This is such a case.\n\n            We divide our analysis into segments.                  We begin by\n\nlimning    the    manner    in   which    the   district    court's   power   to\n\ndeclare mistrials implicates double jeopardy principles.                      We\n\nthen turn to the merits of the appellant's claim.\n\n                    A.     Double Jeopardy Principles.\n\n            The Double Jeopardy Clause ensures that no \"person be\n\nsubject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life\n\nor limb.\"        U.S. Const. amend. V.          This provision \"embodies a\n\ntriumvirate of safeguards,\" United States v. Ortiz-Alarcon, 917\n\nF.2d 651, 653 (1st Cir. 1990), including protection against\n\nserial attempts by the government to convict a defendant on a\n\nsingle charge.       The concept behind this branch of the Double\n\nJeopardy Clause \"is that the State with all its resources and\n\npower should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict\n\nan individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to\n\nembarrassment, expense and ordeal, and . . . enhancing the\n\npossibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\"\n\nGreen v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187-88 (1957).\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f            When a mistrial is declared prior to the rendition of\n\na jury verdict, double jeopardy principles sometimes may bar\n\nfurther prosecution of the charge.         E.g., United    States v.\n\nPierce, 593 F.2d 415, 419-20 (1st Cir. 1979) (foreclosing a\n\nretrial, on double jeopardy grounds, following the declaration\n\nof a mistrial over objection and without sufficient exploration\n\nof available alternatives).     But that is the exception to the\n\nrule:   an    appropriately   declared   mistrial   does   not   insult\n\nprinciples of double jeopardy (and, therefore, does not bar\n\nretrial).    See Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 505 (1978);\n\nUnited States v. Simonetti, 998 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nConsequently, the denial of a motion to dismiss after a jury\n\ndeadlock usually will not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.\n\nRichardson v. United States, 468 U.S. 317, 324 (1984); United\n\nStates v. Barbioni, 62 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1995).      It is against\n\nthis backdrop that we evaluate the merits of the instant appeal.\n\n            Our standard of review is intricate.     Technically, we\n\nare called upon to review the district court's denial of a\n\nmotion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.       On its face, that\n\nmotion presents a pure question of law.      As such, it ordinarily\n\nwould engender de novo review.     E.g., United States v. Morris,\n\n99 F.3d 476, 478 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f               Here, however, there is a wrinkle.               In certain cases,\n\nthe correctness of the district court's decision ultimately\n\nhinges    on    the    justification      for       ordering    a    mistrial.     The\n\ndecision as to whether to declare a mistrial speaks to the\n\ninformed discretion of the district court, and is customarily\n\nreviewed only for abuse of that discretion.                     See United States\n\nv. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir. 1994).                        Where, as here, a\n\nmotion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds trails in the wake\n\nof the district court's declaration of a mistrial, both the\n\nSupreme Court and this court have consistently applied an abuse\n\nof discretion standard in reviewing appeals from the denial of\n\nsuch motions.          E.g., Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. at 514\n\n(explaining that, in such situations, \"reviewing courts have an\n\nobligation to satisfy themselves that . . . the trial judge\n\nexercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial\") (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted); United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470,\n\n486   (1971)     (finding      preclusion       on    double    jeopardy     grounds\n\nbecause    \"the       trial   judge   .   .     .    abused    his    discretion   in\n\ndischarging the jury\"); Barbioni, 62 F.3d at 7 (adopting abuse\n\nof discretion standard in similar circumstances); Simonetti, 998\n\nF.2d at 42 (same).            We therefore review the district court's\n\ndecision here for abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\f            We caution however, that in cases of this genre, review\n\nfor abuse of discretion entails heightened rigor.                    See Jorn, 400\n\nU.S.   at   485       (demanding     a    \"scrupulous    exercise    of   judicial\n\ndiscretion\"       in     this   context).          As   we   use   the    term,   it\n\nencompasses multiple layers of inquiry.                      See Koon v. United\n\nStates, 518 U.S. 81, 98-100 (1996).                     In the course of such\n\nreview, \"we accept the trial court's factual findings only to\n\nthe extent that they are not clearly erroneous.\"                     United States\n\nv. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 291 (1st Cir. 2002).                    In contrast, we\n\nevaluate the district court's articulation of applicable legal\n\nrules de novo, cognizant that a mistake of law is equivalent to\n\nan abuse of discretion.              In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 138 F.3d\n\n442, 444 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65,\n\n67 (1st Cir. 1998).         Only then do we inquire whether, in view of\n\nall the facts and circumstances, the trial court's finding of a\n\nmanifest necessity to discharge the jury and declare a mistrial\n\nconstitutes       a    misuse   of       its   discretion.     See    Illinois    v.\n\nSomerville, 410 U.S. 458, 462-63 (1973); Brady v. Samaha, 667\n\nF.2d 224, 228 (1st Cir. 1981).\n\n                                B.       The Merits.\n\n            The defendant's right to have a particular jury, once\n\nsworn, conclude the trial of his case is of a high order of\n\nimportance.       Consequently, the prosecution bears the burden of\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fjustifying the declaration of a mistrial in a criminal case.\n\nArizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. at 505.             The shorthand reference\n\nfor the requisite quantum of justification has come to be known\n\nas \"manifest necessity.\"           The Supreme Court enunciated this\n\nstandard nearly two centuries ago:\n\n            [I]n all cases of this nature, the law has\n            invested   Courts   of  justice   with   the\n            authority to discharge a jury from giving\n            any verdict, whenever, in their opinion,\n            taking    all   the    circumstances    into\n            consideration, there is a manifest necessity\n            for the act, or the ends of public justice\n            would otherwise be defeated. . . .     [T]he\n            power ought to be used with the greatest\n            caution, under urgent circumstances, and for\n            very plain and obvious causes . . . .\n\nUnited States v. Perez, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580 (1824).\n\n            In previous cases, we have deemed a variety of factors\n\nrelevant    to   the   trier's     determination      of    whether     manifest\n\nnecessity existed.       These include:           (1) whether counsel were\n\nafforded an opportunity to be heard on the issue; (2) whether\n\nalternatives to a mistrial were explored; and (3) whether the\n\njudge's     decision     was     made     after     sufficient      reflection.\n\nSimonetti, 998 F.2d at 41.         While this enumeration is not etched\n\nin stone — each case is different, and the situations that may\n\narise are simply too diverse to render a mechanical checklist\n\ndesirable    —   the   Simonetti    factors       often    serve   as   a   useful\n\nstarting point.\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\f            Here,   those    factors   strongly     support     the    district\n\ncourt's   chosen    course    of    action.        At    each   step    in   the\n\ndeliberative process, the judge went to great lengths to meet\n\nwith the attorneys, solicit their views, and share his thoughts\n\nwith them.     Prior to making critical decisions, he afforded both\n\nlawyers   an    opportunity    to    be    heard   and    considered      their\n\ninsights.      Moreover, the judge and jury exchanged notes on no\n\nfewer than nine separate occasions, and after each exchange, the\n\njudge hewed to our recommended praxis for the handling of such\n\nmissives.      See United States v. Hernandez, 146 F.3d 30, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (discussing that praxis).\n\n            The record also reflects that the second and third\n\nSimonetti criteria were satisfied.            The trial judge carefully\n\nstudied all the available options and reflected not only on the\n\nparties' positions but also on the various ways in which he\n\nmight permissibly nudge the jurors toward a verdict without\n\nunduly pressuring them.        Although the option of a mistrial was\n\navailable the second time that the jury declared itself at an\n\nimpasse, the judge, in close consultation with counsel, eschewed\n\nthat option in favor of a plan of action reasonably calculated\n\nto enhance the possibility of a verdict.           Only when he concluded\n\nthat all hope was lost did he discharge the jury.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f                 In a case such as this, an appellate court's inquiry\n\ninevitably reduces to whether the district judge's declaration\n\nof     a     mistrial          was     reasonably     necessary        under    all   the\n\ncircumstances.            Considering what transpired here — the brevity\n\nof     the       trial,    the        relative    simplicity     of     the    questions\n\nconfronting the jury, the length of deliberations, the fact that\n\nthe court already had given a modified                         Allen charge without\n\nsuccess, and the increasingly adamant manner in which the jurors\n\nannounced that they were deadlocked — the judge's decision to\n\ndeclare          a    mistrial        seems   well    within     the    realm    of   his\n\ndiscretion.            Put another way, the record manifests the \"high\n\ndegree\" of necessity that is required before the presiding judge\n\nlawfully can declare a mistrial, over the defendant's objection,\n\nin a criminal case.                  Barbioni, 62 F.3d at 7.\n\n                 The appellant attempts to blunt the force of this\n\nreasoning by insisting that the judge's failure to give a second\n\nmodified Allen charge before dismissing the jury constituted a\n\nfailure to consider a viable alternative (and, thus, undermined\n\nboth       his       finding    of     manifest      necessity    and    his    eventual\n\ndeclaration of a mistrial).                       This contention is meritless.\n\nAfter all, the requirement that a judge consider alternatives is\n\nnot    tantamount         to     a     requirement     that    the     judge    employ   a\n\nparticular alternative upon demand.\n\n\n                                              -13-\n\f           Though useful in certain circumstances, a modified\n\nAllen charge — colloquially called a \"dynamite charge\" — is not\n\nrisk-free.     Jurors, particularly those who advocate minority\n\nviews, may feel pressured to relinquish conscientiously-held\n\nbeliefs.     See Barone, 114 F.3d at 1304.    We have warned that\n\n\"the problem is exacerbated when the charge is given a second\n\ntime, after the jury has already been told to reconsider and\n\nagain has found itself in deadlock.\"   Id.   Thus, we have made it\n\npellucid that the giving of successive Allen charges is an\n\nextraordinary measure — and one that should be shunned absent\n\nspecial circumstances.    See id. at 1305.\n\n           Here, the record belies any claim that the trial judge\n\nabused his discretion in this regard.        The appellant twice\n\nrequested a second modified Allen charge — once on the early\n\nevening of June 26 and again at midday on June 27 — and the\n\njudge gave each of those requests serious consideration.       He\n\nexplained in some detail why he declined to take so unusual a\n\nstep.   We explain briefly why, on this record, the judge's\n\ndeclination was eminently reasonable.1\n\n\n\n    1The court's refusal, on June 26, to repeat the modified\nAllen charge need not detain us, as the court allowed\ndeliberations to continue at that time.      We therefore focus\nexclusively on the court's refusal to give the requested\ninstruction on June 27 (when it discharged the jury and declared\na mistrial).\n\n                               -14-\n\f           By the end of the deliberations in this case, the\n\nprospects for unanimity were inauspicious — and the judge knew\n\nas much.   See     Keene, 158 F. Supp. 2d at 96.         He also knew that\n\nthe jurors had deliberated for about as long as they had heard\n\nevidence; that the dispute was sharply focused; that the first\n\nmodified Allen charge had proven futile; and that the jurors had\n\nbeen increasingly emphatic in declaring themselves deadlocked.2\n\nThe   appellant,    though    ably   represented,       has   identified    no\n\nspecial circumstances favoring the utterance of yet another\n\nmodified   Allen    charge.      Nor   is   this   an    oversight:        our\n\nindependent scrutiny of the record leaves us unconvinced that\n\nany benefit likely to be derived from a second modified Allen\n\ncharge would have offset the obvious risk of jury coercion\n\ninherent in pressing forward with such an instruction.                Given\n\nthis mise-en-scène, there is simply no basis for finding that\n\nthe judge abused his discretion in refusing to reiterate the\n\nmodified Allen charge.\n\n           In a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, the appellant\n\nargues that the district court erred in giving the modified\n\nAllen charge at too early a time.           This argument is both too\n\nlate and too little.         First, the appellant consented to that\n\n\n      2\n     Indeed, the trial judge — a seasoned veteran — informed the\nlawyers \"that for the first time in my professional career, all\n12 jurors separately have signed the [deadlock] note.\"\n\n                                     -15-\n\finstruction when it was given, and he cannot now be heard to\n\ncomplain that it should have been withheld.       See Barbioni, 62\n\nF.3d at 7 n.2.    Second, the circumstances at that time were not\n\ninimical to the giving of such a charge, and we discern no error\n\n— plain or otherwise — in the trial court's decision to follow\n\nthat course.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.    No less an authority than the\n\nSupreme Court has emphasized that \"the trial court is in the\n\nbest position to assess all the factors which must be considered\n\nin making a necessarily discretionary determination whether the\n\njury will be able to reach a just verdict if it continues to\n\ndeliberate.\"    Arizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. at 510 n.28.   This\n\ncase is a paradigmatic example of that tenet:      the trial judge\n\nreached a plausible conclusion and acted upon it.        Since the\n\nrecord supports the view that manifest necessity existed for the\n\ndistrict court's order, the appellant's post-trial motion to\n\ndismiss the indictment was properly denied.       Accordingly, the\n\nDouble Jeopardy Clause does not bar the government from retrying\n\nthe appellant.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -16-\n\f",

The appellant asseverates that the district court should have acknowledged that it acted too hastily in declaring a mistrial, over the appellant's objection, instead of exhorting the jury to deliberate further, and, accordingly, should have barred further prosecution of the charges against him. Finding this asseveration unpersuasive, we affirm the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury sitting in the District of Maine indicted the appellant on drug-trafficking and criminal forfeiture charges. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 853. Trial on the drug-trafficking counts commenced on June 25, 2001. By early afternoon, the government had completed its case in chief. The court adjourned at that juncture. The jurors returned the next morning and the appellant began to present his defense. Later that day, the appellant rested, the attorneys made their closing arguments, and the court charged the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurors began deliberating at approximately 1:00 p.m. on June 26. Shortly thereafter they sent the judge a note. Finding the note opaque, the judge conferred with counsel. An exchange of notes followed, punctuated by periodic conferences between the judge and the lawyers. Eventually, the jury requested that certain testimony be read back. After again conferring with counsel, the judge acceded to the request but limited the scope of the read-back. The jury then retired to continue its deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a relatively short time, the foreperson informed the court that the members of the jury could not agree upon a verdict. The judge consulted with counsel, who jointly suggested that the jurors be allowed to go home for the day and resume deliberations the next morning. Concerned that this course of action, unexplained, might lead jurors to conclude that they would be obliged to deliberate indefinitely, the judge told the lawyers that he preferred to provide the jurors with instructions of the sort customarily given to deadlocked juries and offer them the opportunity to choose between going home or continuing their deliberations. The attorneys agreed to this proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge thereupon returned the jurors to the courtroom and gave a modified <i>Allen</i> charge. <i>See Allen v. United States,</i> 164 U.S. 492, 501, 17 S.Ct. 154, 41 L.Ed. 528 (1896). He concluded his remarks by presenting the jurors with a choice of how to proceed. After whispered consultations in the jury box, the foreperson advised the court that the jurors wished to continue deliberating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately an hour and a half later &#8212; at 6:22 p.m. &#8212; the jurors sent a note to the judge, reporting that they were \"truly deadlocked.\" To emphasize the point, the foreperson underlined a word fragment in the phrase \"can<i>not</i> come to a unanimous decision.\" The judge conferred with counsel, and all parties concurred that it would be premature to abandon hope for a unanimous verdict. The judge, with the lawyers' approbation, agreed to send the jurors home and bring them back the next morning to resume deliberations. However, defense counsel asked for something more: a supplemental instruction that would in essence amount to a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge. The judge demurred, citing this court's decision in <i>United States v. Barone,</i> 114 F.3d 1284, 1305 (1st Cir. 1997), and dismissed the jury for the day without giving the requested instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurors reconvened on June 27. Almost immediately, they asked that additional testimony be read back. After soliciting the attorneys' views and engaging in an exchange of notes with the jury, the court permitted a read-back of certain testimony. The jury retired to continue its deliberations at about 10:44 a.m. Around noontime, the jurors transmitted yet another note to the judge declaring that \"we cannot come to a unanimous decision\" (emphasis in the original). This time, each juror signed the communiqu&#233;.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge promptly conferred with counsel. The defense attorney renewed his request for a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge. The judge denied the request, explaining that the case did not present special circumstances of a type or kind that would warrant such an unusual measure. Instead, the judge sent the jury a note inquiring whether there was any possibility that, in time, it might arrive at a unanimous decision on either of the two counts. In a reply note, the jury responded in the negative (again emphasizing the word fragment \"<i>not</i>\"). Over the appellant's objection, the judge declared the jury hopelessly deadlocked and ordered a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the appellant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that a retrial would offend the Double Jeopardy Clause. The district court wrote a thoughtful rescript in which it denied the motion. <i>United States v. Keene,</i> 158 F.Supp.2d 93, 95 (D.Me.2001). This interlocutory appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under ordinary circumstances, a defendant cannot take an immediate appeal from an interlocutory order in a criminal case. There is a well-recognized exception, however, that materializes when the defendant is able to mount a colorable claim that further proceedings in the trial court will constitute double jeopardy. <i>See Abney v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 651, 662, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977); <i>United States v. Stoller,</i> 78 F.3d 710, 714 (1st Cir.1996). This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our analysis into segments. We begin by limning the manner in which the district court's power to declare mistrials implicates double jeopardy principles. We then turn to the merits of the appellant's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Double Jeopardy Principles.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause ensures that no \"person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. This provision \"embodies a triumvirate of safeguards,\" <i>United States v. Ortiz-Alarcon,</i> 917 F.2d 651, 653 (1st Cir.1990), including protection against serial attempts by the government to convict a defendant on a single charge. The concept behind this branch of the Double Jeopardy Clause \"is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal, and ... enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\" <i>Green v. United States,</i> 355 U.S. 184, 187-88, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a mistrial is declared prior to the rendition of a jury verdict, double jeopardy principles sometimes may bar further prosecution of the charge. <i>E.g., United States v. Pierce,</i> 593 F.2d 415, 419-20 (1st Cir.1979) (foreclosing a retrial, on double jeopardy grounds, following the declaration of a mistrial over objection and without sufficient exploration of available alternatives). But that is the exception to the rule: an appropriately declared mistrial does not insult principles of double jeopardy (and, therefore, does not bar retrial). <i>See Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. 497, 505, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717 (1978); <i>United States v. Simonetti,</i> 998 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir.1993). Consequently, the denial of a motion to dismiss after a jury deadlock usually will not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. <i>Richardson v. United States,</i> 468 U.S. 317, 324, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (1984); <i>United States v. Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1995). It is against this backdrop that we evaluate the merits of the instant appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our standard of review is intricate. Technically, we are called upon to review the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. On its face, that motion presents a pure question of law. As such, it ordinarily would engender de novo review. <i>E.g., United States v. Morris,</i> 99 F.3d 476, 478 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, there is a wrinkle. In certain cases, the correctness of the district court's decision ultimately hinges on the justification for ordering a mistrial. The decision as to whether to declare a mistrial speaks to the informed discretion of the district court, and is customarily reviewed only for abuse of that discretion. <i>See United States v. Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir.1994). Where, as here, a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds trails in the wake of the district court's declaration of a mistrial, both the Supreme Court and this court have consistently applied an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing appeals from the denial of such motions. <i>E.g., Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. at 514, 98 S.Ct. 824 (explaining that, in such situations, \"reviewing courts have an obligation to satisfy themselves that ... the trial judge exercised sound discretion in declaring a mistrial\") (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>United States v. Jorn,</i> 400 U.S. 470, 486, 91 S.Ct. 547, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971) (finding preclusion on double jeopardy grounds because \"the trial judge ... abused his discretion in discharging the jury\"); <i>Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d at 7 (adopting abuse of discretion standard in similar circumstances); <i>Simonetti,</i> 998 F.2d at 42 (same). We therefore review the district court's decision here for abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We caution however, that in cases of this genre, review for abuse of discretion entails heightened rigor. <i>See Jorn,</i> 400 U.S. at 485, 91 S.Ct. 547 (demanding a \"scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion\" in this context). As we use the term, it encompasses multiple layers of inquiry. <i>See Koon v. United States,</i> 518 U.S. 81, 98-100, 116 S.Ct. 2035, 135 L.Ed.2d 392 (1996). In the course of such review, \"we accept the trial court's factual findings only to the extent that they are not clearly erroneous.\" <i>United States v. Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d 278, 291 (1st Cir. 2002). In contrast, we evaluate the district court's articulation of applicable legal rules de novo, cognizant that a mistake of law is equivalent to an abuse of discretion. <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena,</i> 138 F.3d 442, 444 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Snyder,</i> 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir.1998). Only then do we inquire whether, in view of all the facts and circumstances, the trial court's finding of a manifest necessity to discharge the jury and declare a mistrial constitutes a misuse of its discretion. <i>See</i> <i>Illinois v. Somerville,</i> 410 U.S. 458, 462-63, 93 S.Ct. 1066, 35 L.Ed.2d 425 (1973); <i>Brady v. Samaha,</i> 667 F.2d 224, 228 (1st Cir.1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Merits.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant's right to have a particular jury, once sworn, conclude the trial of his case is of a high order of importance. Consequently, the prosecution bears the burden of justifying the declaration of a mistrial in a criminal case. <i>Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. at 505, 98 S.Ct. 824. The shorthand reference for the requisite quantum of justification has come to be known as \"manifest necessity.\" The Supreme Court enunciated this standard nearly two centuries ago:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]n all cases of this nature, the law has invested Courts of justice with the authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict, whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.... [T]he power ought to be used with the greatest caution, under urgent circumstances, and for very plain and obvious causes....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Perez,</i> 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 579, 580, 6 L.Ed. 165 (1824).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In previous cases, we have deemed a variety of factors relevant to the trier's determination of whether manifest necessity existed. These include: (1) whether counsel were afforded an opportunity to be heard on the issue; (2) whether alternatives to a mistrial were explored; and (3) whether the judge's decision was made after sufficient reflection. <i>Simonetti,</i> 998 F.2d at 41. While this enumeration is not etched in stone &#8212; each case is different, and the situations that may arise are simply too diverse to render a mechanical checklist desirable &#8212; the <i>Simonetti</i> factors often serve as a useful starting point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, those factors strongly support the district court's chosen course of action. At each step in the deliberative process, the judge went to great lengths to meet with the attorneys, solicit their views, and share his thoughts with them. Prior to making critical decisions, he afforded both lawyers an opportunity to be heard and considered their insights. Moreover, the judge and jury exchanged notes on no fewer than nine separate occasions, and after each exchange, the judge hewed to our recommended praxis for the handling of such missives. <i>See United States v. Hernandez,</i> 146 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.1998) (discussing that praxis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also reflects that the second and third <i>Simonetti</i> criteria were satisfied. The trial judge carefully studied all the available options and reflected not only on the parties' positions but also on the various ways in which he might permissibly nudge the jurors toward a verdict without unduly pressuring them. Although the option of a mistrial was available the second time that the jury declared itself at an impasse, the judge, in close consultation with counsel, eschewed that option in favor of a plan of action reasonably calculated to enhance the possibility of a verdict. Only when he concluded that all hope was lost did he discharge the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case such as this, an appellate court's inquiry inevitably reduces to whether the district judge's declaration of a mistrial was reasonably necessary under all the circumstances. Considering what transpired here &#8212; the brevity of the trial, the relative simplicity of the questions confronting the jury, the length of deliberations, the fact that the court already had given a modified <i>Allen</i> charge without success, and the increasingly adamant manner in which the jurors announced that they were deadlocked &#8212; the judge's decision to declare a mistrial seems well within the realm of his discretion. Put another way, the record manifests the \"high degree\" of necessity that is required before the presiding judge lawfully can declare a mistrial, over the defendant's objection, in a criminal case. <i>Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant attempts to blunt the force of this reasoning by insisting that the judge's failure to give a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge before dismissing the jury constituted a failure to consider a viable alternative (and, thus, undermined both his finding of manifest necessity and his eventual declaration of a mistrial). This contention is meritless. After all, the requirement that a judge consider alternatives is not tantamount to a requirement that the judge employ a particular alternative upon demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though useful in certain circumstances, a modified <i>Allen</i> charge &#8212; colloquially called a \"dynamite charge\" &#8212; is not risk-free. Jurors, particularly those who advocate minority views, may feel pressured to relinquish conscientiously-held beliefs. <i>See Barone,</i> 114 F.3d at 1304. We have warned that \"the problem is exacerbated when the charge is given a second time, after the jury has already been told to reconsider and again has found itself in deadlock.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, we have made it pellucid that the giving of successive <i>Allen</i> charges is an extraordinary measure &#8212; and one that should be shunned absent special circumstances. <i>See id.</i> at 1305.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the record belies any claim that the trial judge abused his discretion in this regard. The appellant twice requested a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge &#8212; once on the early evening of June 26 and again at midday on June 27 &#8212; and the judge gave each of those requests serious consideration. He explained in some detail why he declined to take so unusual a step. We explain briefly why, on this record, the judge's declination was eminently reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the end of the deliberations in this case, the prospects for unanimity were inauspicious &#8212; and the judge knew as much. <i>See Keene,</i> 158 F.Supp.2d at 96. He also knew that the jurors had deliberated for about as long as they had heard evidence; that the dispute was sharply focused; that the first modified <i>Allen</i> charge had proven futile; and that the jurors had been increasingly emphatic in declaring themselves deadlocked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The appellant, though ably represented, has identified no special circumstances favoring the utterance of yet another modified <i>Allen</i> charge. Nor is this an oversight: our independent scrutiny of the record leaves us unconvinced that any benefit likely to be derived from a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge would have offset the obvious risk of jury coercion inherent in pressing forward with such an instruction. Given this mise-en-sc&#232;ne, there is simply no basis for finding that the judge abused his discretion in refusing to reiterate the modified <i>Allen</i> charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, the appellant argues that the district court erred in giving the modified <i>Allen</i> charge at too early a time. This argument is both too late and too little. First, the appellant consented to that instruction when it was given, and he cannot now be heard to complain that it should have been withheld. <i>See Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d at 7 n. 2. Second, the circumstances at that time were not inimical to the giving of such a charge, and we discern no error &#8212; plain or otherwise &#8212; in the trial court's decision to follow that course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. No less an authority than the Supreme Court has emphasized that \"the trial court is in the best position to assess all the factors which must be considered in making a necessarily discretionary determination whether the jury will be able to reach a just verdict if it continues to deliberate.\" <i>Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. at 510 n. 28, 98 S.Ct. 824. This case is a paradigmatic example of that tenet: the trial judge reached a plausible conclusion and acted upon it. Since the record supports the view that manifest necessity existed for the district court's order, the appellant's post-trial motion to dismiss the indictment was properly denied. Accordingly, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the government from retrying the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court's refusal, on June 26, to repeat the modified<i>Allen</i> charge need not detain us, as the court allowed deliberations to continue at that time.

The appellant asseverates that the district court should have acknowledged that it acted too hastily in declaring a mistrial, over the appellant's objection, instead of exhorting the jury to deliberate further, and, accordingly, should have barred further prosecution of the charges against him. Finding this asseveration unpersuasive, we affirm the district court's denial of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal grand jury sitting in the District of Maine indicted the appellant on drug-trafficking and criminal forfeiture charges. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 853. Trial on the drug-trafficking counts commenced on June 25, 2001. By early afternoon, the government had completed its case in chief. The court adjourned at that juncture. The jurors returned the next morning and the appellant began to present his defense. Later that day, the appellant rested, the attorneys made their closing arguments, and the court charged the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurors began deliberating at approximately 1:00 p.m. on June 26. Shortly thereafter they sent the judge a note. Finding the note opaque, the judge conferred with counsel. An exchange of notes followed, punctuated by periodic conferences between the judge and the lawyers. Eventually, the jury requested that certain testimony be read back. After again conferring with counsel, the judge acceded to the request but limited the scope of the read-back. The jury then retired to continue its deliberations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a relatively short time, the foreperson informed the court that the members of the jury could not agree upon a verdict. The judge consulted with counsel, who jointly suggested that the jurors be allowed to go home for the day and resume deliberations the next morning. Concerned that this course of action, unexplained, might lead jurors to conclude that they would be obliged to deliberate indefinitely, the judge told the lawyers that he preferred to provide the jurors with instructions of the sort customarily given to deadlocked juries and offer them the opportunity to choose between going home or continuing their deliberations. The attorneys agreed to this proposal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge thereupon returned the jurors to the courtroom and gave a modified <i>Allen</i> charge. <i>See Allen v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94565\"><a href=\"/opinion/94565/allen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 501, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94565\"><a href=\"/opinion/94565/allen-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span> (1896). He concluded his remarks by presenting the jurors with a choice of how to proceed. After whispered consultations in the jury box, the foreperson advised the court that the jurors wished to continue deliberating.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately an hour and a half later &#8212; at 6:22 p.m. &#8212; the jurors sent a note to the judge, reporting that they were \"truly deadlocked.\" To emphasize the point, the foreperson underlined a word fragment in the phrase \"can<i>not</i> come to a unanimous decision.\" The judge conferred with counsel, and all parties concurred that it would be premature to abandon hope for a unanimous verdict. The judge, with the lawyers' approbation, agreed to send the jurors home and bring them back the next morning to resume deliberations. However, defense counsel asked for something more: a supplemental instruction that would in essence amount to a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge. The judge demurred, citing this court's decision in <i>United States v. Barone,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197399\"><a href=\"/opinion/197399/united-states-v-barone/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1284</span></a></span>, 1305 (1st Cir. 1997), and dismissed the jury for the day without giving the requested instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jurors reconvened on June 27. Almost immediately, they asked that additional testimony be read back. After soliciting the attorneys' views and engaging in an exchange of notes with the jury, the court permitted a read-back of certain testimony. The jury retired to continue its deliberations at about 10:44 a.m. Around noontime, the jurors transmitted yet another note to the judge declaring that \"we cannot come to a unanimous decision\" (emphasis in the original). This time, each juror signed the communiqu&#233;.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judge promptly conferred with counsel. The defense attorney renewed his request for a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge. The judge denied the request, explaining that the case did not present special circumstances of a type or kind that would warrant such an unusual measure. Instead, the judge sent the jury a note inquiring whether there was any possibility that, in time, it might arrive at a unanimous decision on either of the two counts. In a reply note, the jury responded in the negative (again emphasizing the word fragment \"<i>not</i>\"). Over the appellant's objection, the judge declared the jury hopelessly deadlocked and ordered a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the appellant moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing that a retrial would offend the Double Jeopardy Clause. The district court wrote a thoughtful rescript in which it denied the motion. <i>United States v. Keene,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2415031\"><a href=\"/opinion/2415031/united-states-v-keene/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under ordinary circumstances, a defendant cannot take an immediate appeal from an interlocutory order in a criminal case. There is a well-recognized exception, however, that materializes when the defendant is able to mount a colorable claim that further proceedings in the trial court will constitute double jeopardy. <i>See Abney v.

This is such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our analysis into segments. We begin by limning the manner in which the district court's power to declare mistrials implicates double jeopardy principles. We then turn to the merits of the appellant's claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Double Jeopardy Principles.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Double Jeopardy Clause ensures that no \"person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\" U.S. Const. amend. V. This provision \"embodies a triumvirate of safeguards,\" <i>United States v. Ortiz-Alarcon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550642\"><a href=\"/opinion/550642/united-states-v-pedro-ortiz-alarcon/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">651</span></a></span>, 653 (1st Cir.1990), including protection against serial attempts by the government to convict a defendant on a single charge. The concept behind this branch of the Double Jeopardy Clause \"is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal, and ... enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\" <i>Green v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105594\"><a href=\"/opinion/105594/green-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></a></span>, 187-88, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105594\"><a href=\"/opinion/105594/green-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">199</span></a></span> (1957).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a mistrial is declared prior to the rendition of a jury verdict, double jeopardy principles sometimes may bar further prosecution of the charge. <i>E.g., United States v. Pierce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"363840\"><a href=\"/opinion/363840/united-states-v-james-d-pierce-and-patrick-a-lanning-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 419-20 (1st Cir.1979) (foreclosing a retrial, on double jeopardy grounds, following the declaration of a mistrial over objection and without sufficient exploration of available alternatives). But that is the exception to the rule: an appropriately declared mistrial does not insult principles of double jeopardy (and, therefore, does not bar retrial). <i>See Arizona v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109773\"><a href=\"/opinion/109773/arizona-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span>, 505, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109773\"><a href=\"/opinion/109773/arizona-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Consequently, the denial of a motion to dismiss after a jury deadlock usually will not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. <i>Richardson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111246\"><a href=\"/opinion/111246/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span>, 324, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111246\"><a href=\"/opinion/111246/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is against this backdrop that we evaluate the merits of the instant appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our standard of review is intricate. Technically, we are called upon to review the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. On its face, that motion presents a pure question of law. As such, it ordinarily would engender de novo review. <i>E.g., United States v. Morris,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197063\"><a href=\"/opinion/197063/united-states-v-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 478 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, however, there is a wrinkle. In certain cases, the correctness of the district court's decision ultimately hinges on the justification for ordering a mistrial. The decision as to whether to declare a mistrial speaks to the informed discretion of the district court, and is customarily reviewed only for abuse of that discretion. <i>See United States v. Pierro,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 617 (1st Cir.1994). Where, as here, a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds trails in the wake of the district court's declaration of a mistrial, both the Supreme Court and this court have consistently applied an abuse of discretion standard in reviewing appeals from the denial of such motions. <i>E.g., Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. at 514, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109773\"><a href=\"/opinion/109773/arizona-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We therefore review the district court's decision here for abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We caution however, that in cases of this genre, review for abuse of discretion entails heightened rigor. <i>See Jorn,</i> 400 U.S. at 485, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108233\"><a href=\"/opinion/108233/united-states-v-jorn/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span> (demanding a \"scrupulous exercise of judicial discretion\" in this context). As we use the term, it encompasses multiple layers of inquiry. <i>See Koon v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 98-100, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118044\"><a href=\"/opinion/118044/koon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In contrast, we evaluate the district court's articulation of applicable legal rules de novo, cognizant that a mistake of law is equivalent to an abuse of discretion. <i>In re Grand Jury Subpoena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197848\"><a href=\"/opinion/197848/in-re-v-grand-jury/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">442</span></a></span>, 444 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v.

Only then do we inquire whether, in view of all the facts and circumstances, the trial court's finding of a manifest necessity to discharge the jury and declare a mistrial constitutes a misuse of its discretion. <i>See</i> <i>Illinois v.

These include: (1) whether counsel were afforded an opportunity to be heard on the issue; (2) whether alternatives to a mistrial were explored; and (3) whether the judge's decision was made after sufficient reflection. <i>Simonetti,</i> 998 F.2d at 41. While this enumeration is not etched in stone &#8212; each case is different, and the situations that may arise are simply too diverse to render a mechanical checklist desirable &#8212; the <i>Simonetti</i> factors often serve as a useful starting point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, those factors strongly support the district court's chosen course of action. At each step in the deliberative process, the judge went to great lengths to meet with the attorneys, solicit their views, and share his thoughts with them. Prior to making critical decisions, he afforded both lawyers an opportunity to be heard and considered their insights. Moreover, the judge and jury exchanged notes on no fewer than nine separate occasions, and after each exchange, the judge hewed to our recommended praxis for the handling of such missives. <i>See United States v. Hernandez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198013\"><a href=\"/opinion/198013/united-states-v-hernandez-favale/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.1998) (discussing that praxis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also reflects that the second and third <i>Simonetti</i> criteria were satisfied. The trial judge carefully studied all the available options and reflected not only on the parties' positions but also on the various ways in which he might permissibly nudge the jurors toward a verdict without unduly pressuring them. Although the option of a mistrial was available the second time that the jury declared itself at an impasse, the judge, in close consultation with counsel, eschewed that option in favor of a plan of action reasonably calculated to enhance the possibility of a verdict. Only when he concluded that all hope was lost did he discharge the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a case such as this, an appellate court's inquiry inevitably reduces to whether the district judge's declaration of a mistrial was reasonably necessary under all the circumstances. Considering what transpired here &#8212; the brevity of the trial, the relative simplicity of the questions confronting the jury, the length of deliberations, the fact that the court already had given a modified <i>Allen</i> charge without success, and the increasingly adamant manner in which the jurors announced that they were deadlocked &#8212; the judge's decision to declare a mistrial seems well within the realm of his discretion. Put another way, the record manifests the \"high degree\" of necessity that is required before the presiding judge lawfully can declare a mistrial, over the defendant's objection, in a criminal case. <i>Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant attempts to blunt the force of this reasoning by insisting that the judge's failure to give a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge before dismissing the jury constituted a failure to consider a viable alternative (and, thus, undermined both his finding of manifest necessity and his eventual declaration of a mistrial). This contention is meritless. After all, the requirement that a judge consider alternatives is not tantamount to a requirement that the judge employ a particular alternative upon demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Though useful in certain circumstances, a modified <i>Allen</i> charge &#8212; colloquially called a \"dynamite charge\" &#8212; is not risk-free. Jurors, particularly those who advocate minority views, may feel pressured to relinquish conscientiously-held beliefs. <i>See Barone,</i> 114 F.3d at 1304. We have warned that \"the problem is exacerbated when the charge is given a second time, after the jury has already been told to reconsider and again has found itself in deadlock.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, we have made it pellucid that the giving of successive <i>Allen</i> charges is an extraordinary measure &#8212; and one that should be shunned absent special circumstances. <i>See id.</i> at 1305.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the record belies any claim that the trial judge abused his discretion in this regard. The appellant twice requested a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge &#8212; once on the early evening of June 26 and again at midday on June 27 &#8212; and the judge gave each of those requests serious consideration. He explained in some detail why he declined to take so unusual a step. We explain briefly why, on this record, the judge's declination was eminently reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the end of the deliberations in this case, the prospects for unanimity were inauspicious &#8212; and the judge knew as much. <i>See Keene,</i> 158 F.Supp.2d at 96. He also knew that the jurors had deliberated for about as long as they had heard evidence; that the dispute was sharply focused; that the first modified <i>Allen</i> charge had proven futile; and that the jurors had been increasingly emphatic in declaring themselves deadlocked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The appellant, though ably represented, has identified no special circumstances favoring the utterance of yet another modified <i>Allen</i> charge. Nor is this an oversight: our independent scrutiny of the record leaves us unconvinced that any benefit likely to be derived from a second modified <i>Allen</i> charge would have offset the obvious risk of jury coercion inherent in pressing forward with such an instruction. Given this mise-en-sc&#232;ne, there is simply no basis for finding that the judge abused his discretion in refusing to reiterate the modified <i>Allen</i> charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a last-ditch effort to stem the tide, the appellant argues that the district court erred in giving the modified <i>Allen</i> charge at too early a time. This argument is both too late and too little. First, the appellant consented to that instruction when it was given, and he cannot now be heard to complain that it should have been withheld. <i>See Barbioni,</i> 62 F.3d at 7 n. 2. Second, the circumstances at that time were not inimical to the giving of such a charge, and we discern no error &#8212; plain or otherwise &#8212; in the trial court's decision to follow that course.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. No less an authority than the Supreme Court has emphasized that \"the trial court is in the best position to assess all the factors which must be considered in making a necessarily discretionary determination whether the jury will be able to reach a just verdict if it continues to deliberate.\" <i>Arizona v. Washington,</i> 434 U.S. at 510 n. 28, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109773\"><a href=\"/opinion/109773/arizona-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span>. This case is a paradigmatic example of that tenet: the trial judge reached a plausible conclusion and acted upon it. Since the record supports the view that manifest necessity existed for the district court's order, the appellant's post-trial motion to dismiss the indictment was properly denied. Accordingly, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the government from retrying the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The court's refusal, on June 26, to repeat the modified<i>Allen</i> charge need not detain us, as the court allowed deliberations to continue at that time. We therefore focus exclusively on the court's refusal to give the requested instruction on June 27 (when it discharged the jury and declared a mistrial).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Indeed, the trial judge &#8212; a seasoned veteran &#8212; informed the lawyers \"that for the first time in my professional career, all 12 jurors separately have signed the [deadlock] note.\"</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
