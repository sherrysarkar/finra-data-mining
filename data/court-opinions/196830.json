It arises out of the actions\r\n\nof various employers alleged to have violated the  National Labor\r\n\nRelations  Act, 29  U.S.C.    151  et  seq. (\"Act\").    The Board\r                                                     \r\n\noriginally  found   that  the  employers  violated   the  Act  by\r\n\nconditioning  continued   employment  on  union   membership  and\r\n\nterminating  employees who failed to join the union.  We remanded\r\n\nto the  Board to make additional  findings.  NLRB v.  Acme Tile &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nTerrazzo Co., 984  F.2d 555 (1st Cir. 1993).   After doing so, it\r                      \r\n\nreached the same conclusion.   Satisfied that the Board  made the\r\n\nnecessary  additional  findings  and  that  those   findings  are\r\n\nsupported  by substantial evidence, we now  hold that the Board's\r\n\norder should be enforced.\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n          Acme Tile  and Terrazzo Co. and Roman Tile and Terrazzo\r\n\n(\"Companies\")  are  members  of  the  Ceramic  Tile,  Marble  and\r\n\nTerrazzo   Contractors   Association   of   Rhode   Island  Corp.\r\n\n(\"Association\"),   a   multi-employer  association   representing\r\n\ncontractors headquartered  in Rhode  Island.  The  Association is\r\n\nthe  authorized  collective  bargaining  representative   of  the\r\n\nCompanies.  The Companies  employ both \"finishers\" and \"setters.\"\r\n\nUntil  December 1988, the finishers  were represented by Local 36\r\n\nof the  Tile, Marble,  Terrazzo Finishers, Shopworkers  &amp; Granite\r\n\nCutters  International Union (\"Local 36\").  Local 36 was party to\r\n\nvarious pre-hire agreements with the Association, the most recent\r\n\nof which  was effective  April 1, 1988, through  March 31,  1989.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nThe setters  were represented  by  Local 1  of the  International\r\n\nUnion  of  Bricklayers  and  Allied  Craftsmen  of  Rhode  Island\r\n\n(\"Bricklayers Union\").   The  Association and the  Companies were\r\n\nalso  parties  to  collective  bargaining  agreements   with  the\r\n\nBricklayers  Union, the most recent of which was effective May 1,\r\n\n1988, through April 30, 1990.\r\n\n          In 1988, Local 36's International Union affiliated with\r\n\nthe International Brotherhood of Carpenters  (\"Carpenters Union\")\r\n\nand  Local 36 was newly designated \"Local 36-T\" of the Carpenters\r\n\nUnion.    A  struggle  between  the  Bricklayers  Union  and  the\r\n\nCarpenters Union  ensued.  In  early 1989, David  Barricelli, the\r\n\nBricklayers Union  Business Manager, approached  Local 36-T about\r\n\nmerging  into  Local   1  of  the  Bricklayers  Union.    Without\r\n\nassurances that their local would retain its autonomy, Local 36-T\r\n\nrejected  the  proposal.   Attempting  to  \"change their  minds,\"\r\n\nBarricelli met with Local 36-T members in February 1989.  He told\r\n\nthem that  if they did  not join the Bricklayers  Union, he would\r\n\nspeak  to  the  local  bricklayer  unions  in  Massachusetts  and\r\n\nConnecticut and  tell them  that  the Local  36-T finishers  were\r\n\ncarpenters  and  should  not  be   permitted  to  work  in  those\r\n\njurisdictions.     The  members  were  unpersuaded.    Barricelli\r\n\nsubsequently wrote the  local bricklayer unions and asked them to\r\n\nreplace the  finishers represented  by the Carpenters  Union with\r\n\nhelpers  belonging to the Bricklayers  Union.  He  sent copies of\r\n\nthe letters to the Companies.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          On March  29, 1989,  the Association members  signed an\r\n\naddendum to its contract with  the Bricklayers Union covering the\r\n\ntile  finishers; the  addendum  became effective  April 1,  1989.\r\n\nRepresentatives of  the Companies  were told that  Barricelli was\r\n\nclaiming  jurisdiction   over  all  finishers'   work  and   that\r\n\nBricklayer Union setters would not work with the Carpenters Union\r\n\nafter  March 31, 1989.  Thus  it appears that  the Companies felt\r\n\nsome compulsion to sign  the addendum to ensure that  the setters\r\n\nwould  not strike.    The agreement  that  the addendum  modified\r\n\ncontained a union security  clause, which required that employees\r\n\nof the  Association's members  become members of  the Bricklayers\r\n\nUnion within eight days of the agreement's execution.\r\n\n          After  signing the addendum with the Bricklayers Union,\r\n\nthe Association and the Companies  notified Local 36-T that  they\r\n\nwere terminating their collective bargaining agreement with Local\r\n\n36-T.   Furthermore, the Companies notified  their employees that\r\n\nthey would have  to contact the Bricklayers Union  business agent\r\n\nand be  referred by the Bricklayers Union to be permitted to work\r\n\non Monday, April 3, 1989.  None of the finishers  showed for work\r\n\nthat  day and the Companies replaced them with finishers from the\r\n\nBricklayers Union.\r\n\n          Local 36-T filed unfair  labor practice charges against\r\n\nthe Companies,  alleging that the Companies  forced the finishers\r\n\nto join  the Bricklayers  Union, contributed unlawful  support to\r\n\nthe Bricklayers  Union,  and terminated  their employees  because\r\n\nthey  refused to join the  Bricklayers Union.   In April 1991, an\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nadministrative law judge issued a decision and recommended order,\r\n\nconcluding that the Companies  had not violated the Act.  The ALJ\r\n\nfound  that the Companies told  the employees on  March 31, 1989,\r\n\nthat  they had to secure a referral from the Bricklayers Union by\r                                             \r\n\nApril 3 if they wanted  to continue working.  The  National Labor\r\n\nRelations  Board (\"Board\")  reversed  the ALJ,  holding that  the\r\n\nCompanies had committed unfair  labor practices.  In  so holding,\r\n\nthe  Board erroneously stated that the ALJ had credited testimony\r\n\nthat on March 31  the Companies required their employees  to join\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe union  by April 3.   The Board ordered that  the employees be\r\n\nreinstated and compensated.\r\n\n          The Board thereafter sought enforcement in this  Court.\r\n\nWe  noted  that the  Act requires  a  seven-day grace  period for\r\n\nemployees   to   join   an  employer-recognized   union   in  the\r\n\nconstruction industry.   29 U.S.C.    158(f).   Thus only if  the\r\n\nCompanies required the employees to join  the union by April 3 --\r                                                  \r\n\ntwo days  into that grace  period --  did they  violate the  Act.\r\n\nDespite the existence of testimony  that could have supported the\r\n\nBoard's conclusion, it relied instead on an erroneous reading  of\r\n\nthe  ALJ's opinion,  as noted  above.   We therefore  vacated the\r\n\nBoard's order  and remanded \"for  a determination of  whether the\r\n\nemployers   explicitly   or   implicitly  conditioned   continued\r\n\nemployment on immediate membership in the Union.\"  Acme Tile, 984\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 556.\r\n\n          The   Board  remanded   the   case  to   the  ALJ   for\r\n\nclarification.  The ALJ reaffirmed its original decision that the\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nCompanies  did not  violate the Act,  and the  Board subsequently\r\n\nreversed.    The  Board  concluded that  the  Companies  violated\r\n\nSection 8(a)(1) and (2) of the  Act, 29 U.S.C.   158(a)(1) &amp; (2),\r\n\nby   conditioning   continued  employment   on   immediate  union\r\n\nmembership in derogation of  the seven-day grace period contained\r\n\nin Section 8(f), 29 U.S.C.   158(f).  It also  concluded that the\r\n\nCompanies violated Section 8(a)(3) and (1), 29 U.S.C.   158(a)(3)\r\n\n&amp; (1),  of the Act by  discharging employees who refused  to join\r\n\nthe  union.    The  Board  again  ordered,  among  other  things,\r\n\nreinstatement with backpay.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          We  will enforce  an  order by  the  Board only  if  it\r\n\ncorrectly  applied  the law  and  if  its  factual  findings  are\r\n\nsupported  by  substantial  evidence  on the  record.    Penntech\r                                                                           \r\n\nPapers,  Inc. v.  NLRB,  706 F.2d  18,  22-23 (1st  Cir.),  cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 464 U.S. 892 (1983).   The Act grants employees the right\r                \r\n\nto \"form,  join, or  assist labor organizations\"  and to  refrain\r\n\nfrom such activity, 29 U.S.C.   157, and makes it an unfair labor\r\n\npractice for  employers to  \"interfere with, restrain,  or coerce\r\n\nemployees  in the  exercise\"  of  those  rights.    29  U.S.C.   \r\n\n158(a)(1).     The  Act  specifically  prohibits  employers  from\r\n\ndiscriminating  \"in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any\r\n\nterm  or  condition  of  employment to  encourage  or  discourage\r\n\nmembership in  any labor organization.\"   29 U.S.C.    158(a)(3).\r\n\nThe Act makes an exception to this broad prohibition that permits\r\n\nan employer  to enter certain union  security contracts requiring\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nunion  membership  as a  condition of  employment.   29  U.S.C.  \r\n\n158(a)(3) (proviso).  But this exception is itself limited by the\r\n\nAct:  a union security agreement in the construction industry may\r\n\nonly require  union membership  \"after the seventh  day following\r\n\nthe beginning of  such employment  or the effective  date of  the\r\n\nagreement, whichever is  later.\"   29 U.S.C.   158(f).   Thus  an\r\n\nemployer commits an  unfair labor  practice if  it terminates  an\r\n\nemployee  during the seven-day  grace period for  failure to join\r\n\nthe  union despite  the  existence of  an  otherwise valid  union\r\n\nsecurity agreement.   In  addition,  an employer  who coerces  an\r\n\nemployee into joining  a union  may also commit  an unfair  labor\r\n\npractice under 29 U.S.C.    158(a)(2) if the coercion  amounts to\r\n\nunlawful \"support\" for that union.\r\n\n          The   Board  concluded  that   the  Companies  violated\r\n\nSections  158(a)(1), (2), and (3).   Key to  that conclusion, and\r\n\ncontrary  to the ALJ's decision, was its factual finding that the\r\n\nCompanies  \"implicitly  conditioned  their  employees'  continued\r\n\nemployment on  immediate  membership in  the Bricklayers  Union.\"\r\n\n318 N.L.R.B. No. 47, 1995 WL 496836.  The Board reasoned that the\r\n\nCompanies'  requirement that  the employees obtain  a \"referral,\"\r\n\n\"approval,\"  or  \"clearance\" from  the  union  was tantamount  to\r\n\nrequiring  immediate   membership  in  the  union,   because  the\r\n\nemployers'  statements  would  \"reasonably  and  foreseeably lead\r\n\ntheir  employees to  believe that  membership in  the Bricklayers\r\n\nUnion by April 3 was required in order to continue working.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          The Companies initially contend  that the Board did not\r\n\ncomply  with this  Court's remand  instruction from  the original\r\n\nappeal.  On remand, we required the Board to make a determination\r\n\nas  to  whether  the   Companies  had  explicitly  or  implicitly\r\n\nconditioned continued  employment on union membership.   984 F.2d\r\n\nat  556.   In  its original  opinion,  the Board  had essentially\r\n\nstated  that  the Companies  made  union  membership an  explicit\r\n\ncondition,  but we  found that  determination to  be based  on an\r\n\nerroneous reading of the ALJ's findings.  We noted that testimony\r\n\nexisted that  might demonstrate  an explicit condition,  but that\r\n\nthe Board had not relied on that testimony.  It is quite apparent\r\n\nfrom  any fair  reading of  the Board's  latest decision  that it\r\n\ncomplied with this  Court's remand instructions.  Deciding not to\r\n\nbase its  holding  on the  testimony  just mentioned,  which  was\r\n\ncontradicted  by  other  testimony,  the  Board  found  that  the\r\n\nevidence supported  a finding  that the Companies  had implicitly\r\n\nconditioned continued employment on  union membership.  The Board\r\n\ncomplied with our remand instructions to the letter, and the only\r\n\nremaining question is whether  its determination was supported by\r\n\nsubstantial evidence.\r\n\n          On  the issue  of substantial  evidence,  the Companies\r\n\nfirst argue that  the Board  lacked any basis  for rejecting  the\r\n\nALJ's finding  that the Companies merely  advised their employees\r\n\nof the procedures under the new contract rather than coerced them\r\n\ninto joining the Bricklayers  Union.  The ALJ concluded  that the\r\n\nemployers'  statements were  simply  observations of  the natural\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nconsequences of the union security provision in the new  contract\r\n\nand  that the  employees  were merely  informed  of how  the  new\r\n\nprocedures  would affect  them  when they  returned  to work  the\r\n\nfollowing  Monday.   While  it is  true  that we  afford  the ALJ\r\n\ndeference  on questions  of  witness credibility,  see  Universal\r                                                                           \r\n\nCamera Corp.  v. NLRB, 340  U.S. 474, 496-497  (1951), we  do not\r                               \r\n\nagree with the  Companies that the  Board necessarily rejected  a\r\n\ncredibility determination of the ALJ to reach its conclusion, nor\r\n\nwould it necessarily  be dispositive  if it had.   Id.  (implying\r                                                                \r\n\nthat deference  to the factfinder is subsumed  in the substantial\r\n\nevidence test).  The Board accepted testimony credited by the ALJ\r\n\nto the  effect that the  Companies had not  expressly conditioned\r\n\ncontinued employment  on union  membership -- that  the Companies\r\n\nonly required  a \"referral,\" \"approval,\" or  \"clearance\" from the\r\n\nunion.   In determining that even these statements amounted to an\r\n\nunlawful  implicit  condition,  the Board  relied  on  additional\r\n\nevidence regarding the  circumstances in  which these  statements\r\n\nwere  made.  The Board  did not reverse  any credibility findings\r\n\nmade by the ALJ.\r\n\n          Furthermore, substantial evidence supports  the Board's\r\n\nfindings  on  the  circumstances surrounding  the  statements and\r\n\ntheir  implicit message to the employees.  The Board first turned\r\n\nto the governing contract and noted that there was no contractual\r\n\nreason  why the Companies needed to require a \"referral\" from the\r\n\nUnion.  The contract provided that employers could freely hire or\r\n\nreject  qualified journeymen  at a  job site.   Thus  requiring a\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n\"referral\" from  the Union implied that the  employees would have\r\n\nto join the Bricklayers Union in order to remain on the job.  The\r\n\nBoard then recounted the  Bricklayers Union's ongoing campaign to\r\n\nforce all finishers into the Union.  Both employers and employees\r\n\nwere  generally aware  of  Barricelli's efforts  in this  regard,\r\n\nincluding his  threatening letters and oral statements.  Based on\r\n\nBarricelli's actions, the employees would assume that in order to\r\n\nobtain  a \"referral,\"  they would  have  to join  the Bricklayers\r\n\nUnion;  the  Companies  could  reasonably  have  drawn  the  same\r\n\nconclusion.   Thus viewing the  statements in the  context of the\r\n\nongoing  campaign,  the Board  had  substantial  support for  its\r\n\nconclusion  that   requiring  a  \"referral\"   was  tantamount  to\r\n\nconditioning continued employment on union membership.\r\n\n          The Companies acknowledge in  their brief to this Court\r\n\nthat the  record evidence could  support an inference  that union\r\n\nmembership was necessary for continued employment, but they state\r\n\nthat the evidence equally supports the opposite inference -- that\r\n\nunion  membership was  not  necessary so  long  as the  employees\r\n\nobtained   a  referral.    (Pet.  Br.  at  31).    The  Companies\r\n\nmisconstrue  the substantial evidence test.   Out task  is to ask\r\n\nwhether the Board's conclusion rests on substantial evidence, not\r\n\nwhether some other conclusion  is equally supportable.

NLRB,\r                                                                          \r\n\n825 F.2d 608, 612 (1st Cir.  1987); Andino v. NLRB, 619 F.2d 147,\r                                                            \r\n\n151 (1st Cir. 1980).  The Companies' additional argument that the\r\n\nBoard's  conclusions relate to two employers not involved in this\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nappeal is  also without  merit.   The  Board mentioned  testimony\r\n\nspecific  to those  two companies,  but the  substantial evidence\r\n\noutlined above relates equally to the present Companies.\r\n\n          Finally,  substantial  evidence  supports  the  Board's\r\n\nfinding that the Companies terminated their employees for failing\r\n\nto  join the  Bricklayers  Union.   The  ALJ had  concluded  that\r\n\nemployees  failed to  show  up for  work  only because  of  their\r\n\nloyalty  to the Carpenters  Union.  The  Board properly concluded\r\n\nthat  the  ALJ's finding  was  merely  speculative.   The  record\r\n\nindicated that some finishers  later joined the Bricklayers Union\r\n\nand  returned to  work,  undercutting the  ALJ's conclusion  that\r\n\nloyalty  prevented  employees  from  working.   The  record  also\r\n\ncontained statements  by the Companies that  work stoppages could\r\n\noccur in Massachusetts and Connecticut, where they had collective\r\n\nbargaining agreements with the Bricklayers Union, if employees in\r\n\nthose states did  not join  the Bricklayers Union.   The  Board's\r\n\nconclusion  that employees failed to show  up for work based on a\r\n\nbelief that  they would  not be  allowed to do  so without  first\r\n\njoining  the   Bricklayers  Union  was   therefore  supported  by\r\n\nsubstantial evidence.\r\n\n                               III.\r\n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons,   the  Board's  order  is\r\n\nENFORCED.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n",

After doing so, it\r                      \r\n\nreached the same conclusion.   Satisfied that the Board  made the\r\n\nnecessary  additional  findings  and  that  those   findings  are\r\n\nsupported  by substantial evidence, we now  hold that the Board's\r\n\norder should be enforced.\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n          Acme Tile  and Terrazzo Co. and Roman Tile and Terrazzo\r\n\n(\"Companies\")  are  members  of  the  Ceramic  Tile,  Marble  and\r\n\nTerrazzo   Contractors   Association   of   Rhode   Island  Corp.\r\n\n(\"Association\"),   a   multi-employer  association   representing\r\n\ncontractors headquartered  in Rhode  Island.  The  Association is\r\n\nthe  authorized  collective  bargaining  representative   of  the\r\n\nCompanies.  The Companies  employ both \"finishers\" and \"setters.\"\r\n\nUntil  December 1988, the finishers  were represented by Local 36\r\n\nof the  Tile, Marble,  Terrazzo Finishers, Shopworkers  &amp; Granite\r\n\nCutters  International Union (\"Local 36\").  Local 36 was party to\r\n\nvarious pre-hire agreements with the Association, the most recent\r\n\nof which  was effective  April 1, 1988, through  March 31,  1989.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nThe setters  were represented  by  Local 1  of the  International\r\n\nUnion  of  Bricklayers  and  Allied  Craftsmen  of  Rhode  Island\r\n\n(\"Bricklayers Union\").   The  Association and the  Companies were\r\n\nalso  parties  to  collective  bargaining  agreements   with  the\r\n\nBricklayers  Union, the most recent of which was effective May 1,\r\n\n1988, through April 30, 1990.\r\n\n          In 1988, Local 36's International Union affiliated with\r\n\nthe International Brotherhood of Carpenters  (\"Carpenters Union\")\r\n\nand  Local 36 was newly designated \"Local 36-T\" of the Carpenters\r\n\nUnion.    A  struggle  between  the  Bricklayers  Union  and  the\r\n\nCarpenters Union  ensued.  In  early 1989, David  Barricelli, the\r\n\nBricklayers Union  Business Manager, approached  Local 36-T about\r\n\nmerging  into  Local   1  of  the  Bricklayers  Union.    Without\r\n\nassurances that their local would retain its autonomy, Local 36-T\r\n\nrejected  the  proposal.   Attempting  to  \"change their  minds,\"\r\n\nBarricelli met with Local 36-T members in February 1989.  He told\r\n\nthem that  if they did  not join the Bricklayers  Union, he would\r\n\nspeak  to  the  local  bricklayer  unions  in  Massachusetts  and\r\n\nConnecticut and  tell them  that  the Local  36-T finishers  were\r\n\ncarpenters  and  should  not  be   permitted  to  work  in  those\r\n\njurisdictions.     The  members  were  unpersuaded.    Barricelli\r\n\nsubsequently wrote the  local bricklayer unions and asked them to\r\n\nreplace the  finishers represented  by the Carpenters  Union with\r\n\nhelpers  belonging to the Bricklayers  Union.  He  sent copies of\r\n\nthe letters to the Companies.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          On March  29, 1989,  the Association members  signed an\r\n\naddendum to its contract with  the Bricklayers Union covering the\r\n\ntile  finishers; the  addendum  became effective  April 1,  1989.\r\n\nRepresentatives of  the Companies  were told that  Barricelli was\r\n\nclaiming  jurisdiction   over  all  finishers'   work  and   that\r\n\nBricklayer Union setters would not work with the Carpenters Union\r\n\nafter  March 31, 1989.  Thus  it appears that  the Companies felt\r\n\nsome compulsion to sign  the addendum to ensure that  the setters\r\n\nwould  not strike.    The agreement  that  the addendum  modified\r\n\ncontained a union security  clause, which required that employees\r\n\nof the  Association's members  become members of  the Bricklayers\r\n\nUnion within eight days of the agreement's execution.\r\n\n          After  signing the addendum with the Bricklayers Union,\r\n\nthe Association and the Companies  notified Local 36-T that  they\r\n\nwere terminating their collective bargaining agreement with Local\r\n\n36-T.   Furthermore, the Companies notified  their employees that\r\n\nthey would have  to contact the Bricklayers Union  business agent\r\n\nand be  referred by the Bricklayers Union to be permitted to work\r\n\non Monday, April 3, 1989.  None of the finishers  showed for work\r\n\nthat  day and the Companies replaced them with finishers from the\r\n\nBricklayers Union.\r\n\n          Local 36-T filed unfair  labor practice charges against\r\n\nthe Companies,  alleging that the Companies  forced the finishers\r\n\nto join  the Bricklayers  Union, contributed unlawful  support to\r\n\nthe Bricklayers  Union,  and terminated  their employees  because\r\n\nthey  refused to join the  Bricklayers Union.   In April 1991, an\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nadministrative law judge issued a decision and recommended order,\r\n\nconcluding that the Companies  had not violated the Act.  The ALJ\r\n\nfound  that the Companies told  the employees on  March 31, 1989,\r\n\nthat  they had to secure a referral from the Bricklayers Union by\r                                             \r\n\nApril 3 if they wanted  to continue working.  The  National Labor\r\n\nRelations  Board (\"Board\")  reversed  the ALJ,  holding that  the\r\n\nCompanies had committed unfair  labor practices.  In  so holding,\r\n\nthe  Board erroneously stated that the ALJ had credited testimony\r\n\nthat on March 31  the Companies required their employees  to join\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe union  by April 3.   The Board ordered that  the employees be\r\n\nreinstated and compensated.\r\n\n          The Board thereafter sought enforcement in this  Court.\r\n\nWe  noted  that the  Act requires  a  seven-day grace  period for\r\n\nemployees   to   join   an  employer-recognized   union   in  the\r\n\nconstruction industry.   29 U.S.C.    158(f).   Thus only if  the\r\n\nCompanies required the employees to join  the union by April 3 --\r                                                  \r\n\ntwo days  into that grace  period --  did they  violate the  Act.\r\n\nDespite the existence of testimony  that could have supported the\r\n\nBoard's conclusion, it relied instead on an erroneous reading  of\r\n\nthe  ALJ's opinion,  as noted  above.   We therefore  vacated the\r\n\nBoard's order  and remanded \"for  a determination of  whether the\r\n\nemployers   explicitly   or   implicitly  conditioned   continued\r\n\nemployment on immediate membership in the Union.\"  Acme Tile, 984\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 556.\r\n\n          The   Board  remanded   the   case  to   the  ALJ   for\r\n\nclarification.  The ALJ reaffirmed its original decision that the\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nCompanies  did not  violate the Act,  and the  Board subsequently\r\n\nreversed.    The  Board  concluded that  the  Companies  violated\r\n\nSection 8(a)(1) and (2) of the  Act, 29 U.S.C.   158(a)(1) &amp; (2),\r\n\nby   conditioning   continued  employment   on   immediate  union\r\n\nmembership in derogation of  the seven-day grace period contained\r\n\nin Section 8(f), 29 U.S.C.   158(f).  It also  concluded that the\r\n\nCompanies violated Section 8(a)(3) and (1), 29 U.S.C.   158(a)(3)\r\n\n&amp; (1),  of the Act by  discharging employees who refused  to join\r\n\nthe  union.    The  Board  again  ordered,  among  other  things,\r\n\nreinstatement with backpay.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          We  will enforce  an  order by  the  Board only  if  it\r\n\ncorrectly  applied  the law  and  if  its  factual  findings  are\r\n\nsupported  by  substantial  evidence  on the  record.

The Act grants employees the right\r                \r\n\nto \"form,  join, or  assist labor organizations\"  and to  refrain\r\n\nfrom such activity, 29 U.S.C.   157, and makes it an unfair labor\r\n\npractice for  employers to  \"interfere with, restrain,  or coerce\r\n\nemployees  in the  exercise\"  of  those  rights.    29  U.S.C.   \r\n\n158(a)(1).     The  Act  specifically  prohibits  employers  from\r\n\ndiscriminating  \"in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any\r\n\nterm  or  condition  of  employment to  encourage  or  discourage\r\n\nmembership in  any labor organization.\"   29 U.S.C.    158(a)(3).\r\n\nThe Act makes an exception to this broad prohibition that permits\r\n\nan employer  to enter certain union  security contracts requiring\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nunion  membership  as a  condition of  employment.   29  U.S.C.  \r\n\n158(a)(3) (proviso).  But this exception is itself limited by the\r\n\nAct:  a union security agreement in the construction industry may\r\n\nonly require  union membership  \"after the seventh  day following\r\n\nthe beginning of  such employment  or the effective  date of  the\r\n\nagreement, whichever is  later.\"   29 U.S.C.   158(f).   Thus  an\r\n\nemployer commits an  unfair labor  practice if  it terminates  an\r\n\nemployee  during the seven-day  grace period for  failure to join\r\n\nthe  union despite  the  existence of  an  otherwise valid  union\r\n\nsecurity agreement.   In  addition,  an employer  who coerces  an\r\n\nemployee into joining  a union  may also commit  an unfair  labor\r\n\npractice under 29 U.S.C.    158(a)(2) if the coercion  amounts to\r\n\nunlawful \"support\" for that union.\r\n\n          The   Board  concluded  that   the  Companies  violated\r\n\nSections  158(a)(1), (2), and (3).   Key to  that conclusion, and\r\n\ncontrary  to the ALJ's decision, was its factual finding that the\r\n\nCompanies  \"implicitly  conditioned  their  employees'  continued\r\n\nemployment on  immediate  membership in  the Bricklayers  Union.\"\r\n\n318 N.L.R.B. No. 47, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">496836</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.  The Board reasoned that the\r\n\nCompanies'  requirement that  the employees obtain  a \"referral,\"\r\n\n\"approval,\"  or  \"clearance\" from  the  union  was tantamount  to\r\n\nrequiring  immediate   membership  in  the  union,   because  the\r\n\nemployers'  statements  would  \"reasonably  and  foreseeably lead\r\n\ntheir  employees to  believe that  membership in  the Bricklayers\r\n\nUnion by April 3 was required in order to continue working.\"  Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\n          The Companies initially contend  that the Board did not\r\n\ncomply  with this  Court's remand  instruction from  the original\r\n\nappeal.  On remand, we required the Board to make a determination\r\n\nas  to  whether  the   Companies  had  explicitly  or  implicitly\r\n\nconditioned continued  employment on union membership.   984 F.2d\r\n\nat  556.   In  its original  opinion,  the Board  had essentially\r\n\nstated  that  the Companies  made  union  membership an  explicit\r\n\ncondition,  but we  found that  determination to  be based  on an\r\n\nerroneous reading of the ALJ's findings.  We noted that testimony\r\n\nexisted that  might demonstrate  an explicit condition,  but that\r\n\nthe Board had not relied on that testimony.  It is quite apparent\r\n\nfrom  any fair  reading of  the Board's  latest decision  that it\r\n\ncomplied with this  Court's remand instructions.  Deciding not to\r\n\nbase its  holding  on the  testimony  just mentioned,  which  was\r\n\ncontradicted  by  other  testimony,  the  Board  found  that  the\r\n\nevidence supported  a finding  that the Companies  had implicitly\r\n\nconditioned continued employment on  union membership.  The Board\r\n\ncomplied with our remand instructions to the letter, and the only\r\n\nremaining question is whether  its determination was supported by\r\n\nsubstantial evidence.\r\n\n          On  the issue  of substantial  evidence,  the Companies\r\n\nfirst argue that  the Board  lacked any basis  for rejecting  the\r\n\nALJ's finding  that the Companies merely  advised their employees\r\n\nof the procedures under the new contract rather than coerced them\r\n\ninto joining the Bricklayers  Union.  The ALJ concluded  that the\r\n\nemployers'  statements were  simply  observations of  the natural\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nconsequences of the union security provision in the new  contract\r\n\nand  that the  employees  were merely  informed  of how  the  new\r\n\nprocedures  would affect  them  when they  returned  to work  the\r\n\nfollowing  Monday.   While  it is  true  that we  afford  the ALJ\r\n\ndeference  on questions  of  witness credibility,  see  Universal\r                                                                           \r\n\nCamera Corp.  v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104856\"><a href=\"/opinion/104856/universal-camera-corp-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496-497  (1951), we  do not\r                               \r\n\nagree with the  Companies that the  Board necessarily rejected  a\r\n\ncredibility determination of the ALJ to reach its conclusion, nor\r\n\nwould it necessarily  be dispositive  if it had.   Id.  (implying\r                                                                \r\n\nthat deference  to the factfinder is subsumed  in the substantial\r\n\nevidence test).  The Board accepted testimony credited by the ALJ\r\n\nto the  effect that the  Companies had not  expressly conditioned\r\n\ncontinued employment  on union  membership -- that  the Companies\r\n\nonly required  a \"referral,\" \"approval,\" or  \"clearance\" from the\r\n\nunion.   In determining that even these statements amounted to an\r\n\nunlawful  implicit  condition,  the Board  relied  on  additional\r\n\nevidence regarding the  circumstances in  which these  statements\r\n\nwere  made.  The Board  did not reverse  any credibility findings\r\n\nmade by the ALJ.\r\n\n          Furthermore, substantial evidence supports  the Board's\r\n\nfindings  on  the  circumstances surrounding  the  statements and\r\n\ntheir  implicit message to the employees.  The Board first turned\r\n\nto the governing contract and noted that there was no contractual\r\n\nreason  why the Companies needed to require a \"referral\" from the\r\n\nUnion.  The contract provided that employers could freely hire or\r\n\nreject  qualified journeymen  at a  job site.   Thus  requiring a\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n\"referral\" from  the Union implied that the  employees would have\r\n\nto join the Bricklayers Union in order to remain on the job.  The\r\n\nBoard then recounted the  Bricklayers Union's ongoing campaign to\r\n\nforce all finishers into the Union.  Both employers and employees\r\n\nwere  generally aware  of  Barricelli's efforts  in this  regard,\r\n\nincluding his  threatening letters and oral statements.  Based on\r\n\nBarricelli's actions, the employees would assume that in order to\r\n\nobtain  a \"referral,\"  they would  have  to join  the Bricklayers\r\n\nUnion;  the  Companies  could  reasonably  have  drawn  the  same\r\n\nconclusion.   Thus viewing the  statements in the  context of the\r\n\nongoing  campaign,  the Board  had  substantial  support for  its\r\n\nconclusion  that   requiring  a  \"referral\"   was  tantamount  to\r\n\nconditioning continued employment on union membership.\r\n\n          The Companies acknowledge in  their brief to this Court\r\n\nthat the  record evidence could  support an inference  that union\r\n\nmembership was necessary for continued employment, but they state\r\n\nthat the evidence equally supports the opposite inference -- that\r\n\nunion  membership was  not  necessary so  long  as the  employees\r\n\nobtained   a  referral.    (Pet.  Br.  at  31).    The  Companies\r\n\nmisconstrue  the substantial evidence test.   Out task  is to ask\r\n\nwhether the Board's conclusion rests on substantial evidence, not\r\n\nwhether some other conclusion  is equally supportable.  Universal\r                                                                           \r\n\nCamera, 340 U.S. at  488; Teamsters Local  Union No. 42 v.  NLRB,\r                                                                          \r\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492356\"><a href=\"/opinion/492356/teamsters-local-union-no-42-aw-international-brotherhood-of-teamsters/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 612 (1st Cir.  1987); Andino v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"376981\"><a href=\"/opinion/376981/jaime-andino-dba-jaime-andino-trucking-v-national-labor-relations-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r                                                            \r\n\n151 (1st Cir. 1980).  The Companies' additional argument that the\r\n\nBoard's  conclusions relate to two employers not involved in this\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nappeal is  also without  merit.   The  Board mentioned  testimony\r\n\nspecific  to those  two companies,  but the  substantial evidence\r\n\noutlined above relates equally to the present Companies.\r\n\n          Finally,  substantial  evidence  supports  the  Board's\r\n\nfinding that the Companies terminated their employees for failing\r\n\nto  join the  Bricklayers  Union.   The  ALJ had  concluded  that\r\n\nemployees  failed to  show  up for  work  only because  of  their\r\n\nloyalty  to the Carpenters  Union.  The  Board properly concluded\r\n\nthat  the  ALJ's finding  was  merely  speculative.   The  record\r\n\nindicated that some finishers  later joined the Bricklayers Union\r\n\nand  returned to  work,  undercutting the  ALJ's conclusion  that\r\n\nloyalty  prevented  employees  from  working.   The  record  also\r\n\ncontained statements  by the Companies that  work stoppages could\r\n\noccur in Massachusetts and Connecticut, where they had collective\r\n\nbargaining agreements with the Bricklayers Union, if employees in\r\n\nthose states did  not join  the Bricklayers Union.   The  Board's\r\n\nconclusion  that employees failed to show  up for work based on a\r\n\nbelief that  they would  not be  allowed to do  so without  first\r\n\njoining  the   Bricklayers  Union  was   therefore  supported  by\r\n\nsubstantial evidence.\r\n\n                               III.\r\n\n          For  the  foregoing  reasons,   the  Board's  order  is\r\n\nENFORCED.\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n</pre>",
