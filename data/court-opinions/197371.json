She claims that  her trial  was\r\n\nflawed  in that the court  gave an improper  Allen charge and\r                                                              \r\n\nthat  there   was  insufficient   evidence  to  support   her\r\n\nconviction.   She  also  argues error  in  the trial  court's\r\n\ndenial of her motion for a new trial.  Finally, she  disputes\r\n\nthe court's determination of her sentence.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          Ortega  was charged with distributing crack cocaine\r\n\nin violation  of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.   2, and\r\n\nconspiracy  to distribute  crack cocaine  in violation  of 21\r\n\nU.S.C.     841(a)(1),  846.    Her  arrest resulted  from  an\r\n\nongoing   undercover   operation   conducted   by   the  Drug\r\n\nEnforcement Agency (\"DEA\").\r\n\n          Between  December  18  and  19,  1994,  Hector  San\r\n\nMartin, a DEA informant,  made arrangements to purchase crack\r\n\nfrom Julio Valdez at a Providence, Rhode Island, Burger King.\r\n\nAlthough Valdez himself had made a  previous drug delivery to\r\n\nSan  Martin several days  earlier, Valdez told  San Martin by\r\n\nphone  that this  time the  crack would  be delivered  in the\r\n\nBurger King  parking lot on  December 19  by a boy,  girl, or\r\n\nwoman.  The Burger King was located about a quarter mile from\r\n\nthe  apartment  Valdez  was  using  at  37  Labin  Street  in\r\n\nProvidence.    \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          On the day of  the deal, Valdez told San  Martin by\r\n\nphone that  a lady  in white  would deliver the  drugs.   The\r\n\n\"lady in white\" turned out to be Ortega.\r\n\n          That afternoon, DEA agents  conducting surveillance\r\n\nobserved  Valdez  and Ortega  emerge  from  the Labin  Street\r\n\napartment and walk together to the Burger King.  After Valdez\r\n\npointed  to San Martin's car, Ortega got into the front seat.\r\n\nValdez remained nearby to keep a lookout. \r\n\n          According  to San  Martin's testimony,  when Ortega\r\n\nentered  the car, he asked Ortega if she had \"the stuff,\" and\r\n\nshe replied \"yes.\"   She then pulled out a  clear plastic bag\r\n\ncontaining cocaine base from her inside jacket pocket.  After\r\n\nSan  Martin explained  that he wanted  to check  the quality,\r\n\nOrtega answered \"okay\" and handed the bag to him.  \r\n\n          Leaving  the crack bag on the floor of the car, San\r\n\nMartin told Ortega  that the money was  in the trunk  and got\r\n\nout.  At the sight of the raised trunk door -- the signal for\r\n\narrest  -- DEA agents moved  in to arrest  Valdez and Ortega.\r\n\nAfter  a  few seconds,  Ortega got  out  of the  car  and ran\r\n\nscreaming;  she was caught and arrested by one of the agents.\r\n\nValdez, who had also tried to run, was caught and arrested as\r\n\nwell. \r\n\n          In  her statement to  police, Ortega  complained of\r\n\nsevere neck pain due to a thyroid condition and said that she\r\n\nhad been at 37 Labin Street, her girlfriend's apartment, only\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nto rest.   She explained her  walk to the  Burger King as  an\r\n\nattempt to ease the pain.  As for the drug delivery, she said\r\n\nonly that  at some point  she was asked  to do a  \"favor\" and\r\n\nthat  because  of her  physical  pain, she  was  not thinking\r\n\nclearly.\r\n\n          On the second day of jury deliberations at Ortega's\r\n\ntrial,  the jury  informed the  court that  it had  reached a\r\n\nverdict  on all counts  but was deadlocked  on the conspiracy\r\n\ncount.     The  court  then  issued   a  supplemental  charge\r\n\ninstructing the jury to  go back and try to  reach a verdict.\r\n\nThirty minutes later,  the jury returned a guilty  verdict on\r\n\nthe conspiracy charge.\r\n\n          At sentencing,  the court  found that Ortega  had a\r\n\nbase offense level  of 32 based on the quantity  of crack she\r\n\nwas delivering  (84.3 grams) and a  criminal history category\r\n\nof  I.  The court then granted a two-level reduction pursuant\r\n\nto U.S.S.G.   5C1.2 and  a four-level reduction for  Ortega's\r\n\nminimal role in  the offense.   Thus, the  offense level  was\r\n\nreduced  from 32  to 26,  and defendant  was sentenced  to 63\r\n\nmonths in prison and 5 years of supervised release.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Ortega's   motion   for  acquittal   based   on  an\r\n\ninsufficient evidence  argument  was denied  by the  district\r\n\ncourt.  Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the\r\n\ngovernment,  a rational jury could  have found guilt beyond a\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nreasonable doubt.   See United  States v.  Dockray, 943  F.2d\r                                                              \r\n\n152, 157 (1st Cir.  1991).  We therefore affirm  the district\r\n\ncourt's  denial of Ortega's Rule  29(c) motion.   See Fed. R.\r                                                                 \r\n\nCrim. P. 29(c).\r\n\n          To prove  conspiracy, the government must show that\r\n\nthe  defendant had the intent to agree and that the defendant\r\n\nhad  an  intent  to  distribute cocaine  --  the  substantive\r\n\noffense.  See  United States  v. DeLutis, 722  F.2d 902,  905\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1983).  Viewing the evidence and drawing inferences\r\n\ntherefrom, a rational jury  member could certainly have found\r\n\nguilt  beyond  a reasonable  doubt.    See  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nMontas, 41 F.3d 775,  778 (1st Cir. 1994), cert.  denied, 115\r                                                                    \r\n\nS.  Ct.  1986  (1995).     Such  evidence  included  Valdez's\r\n\nstatement  to San  Martin that  a woman  wearing white  would\r\n\ndeliver the  drugs, Ortega's walk  with Valdez to  the Burger\r\n\nKing, Ortega's entrance into a stranger's car, and her prompt\r\n\ndelivery of a bag containing  crack previously hidden on  her\r\n\nbody, when asked for \"the stuff.\"   \r\n\n          This  case is  unlike  those Ortega  cites for  the\r\n\nproposition that  a single  drug transaction  is insufficient\r\n\nevidence of conspiracy.  See, e.g., Delutis, 722 F.2d at 906;\r                                                       \r\n\nUnited States v. Izzi,  613 F.2d 1205, 1210 (1st  Cir. 1980).\r                                 \r\n\nThere is no such per se rule in any event; we look at all the\r\n\nfacts in  the case.  DeLutis merely held that the single sale\r                                        \r\n\nthere  was insufficient  to tie  the defendant  buyer  to the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nsellers' drug distribution  conspiracies.   See DeLutis,  722\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d at  905-06;  see also United States v. Acevedo, 842 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n502,  505-06 (1st  Cir.  1988) (rejecting  the argument  that\r\n\nevidence of conspiracy  between sellers must  be insufficient\r\n\nbecause it involved only a single  sale).  A single sale  can\r\n\nestablish  a common  purpose on  the part  of the  sellers --\r\n\nhere, Ortega  and Valdez.   See Acevedo,  842 F.2d  at 506.  \r                                                   \r\n\nMoreover, in  DeLutis, there was no  direct or circumstantial\r                                 \r\n\nevidence that defendant intended  to agree to become involved\r\n\nin a larger supplier/distributor relationship, and there  was\r\n\nno basis  to infer based on  the single act in  question.  In\r\n\nIzzi,  there  was  no   evidence  of  agreement  linking  the\r                \r\n\ndefendant to the broader  conspiracy during the dates charged\r\n\nin the indictment.  Here, there  were only two members of the\r\n\nconspiracy, and  it is not  difficult to infer  knowledge and\r\n\nagreement.   \r\n\n          Other  cases  Ortega  cites  for  support  are also\r\n\ndistinguishable.   See,  e.g., United  States v.  Ocampo, 964\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 80 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Mehtala, 578 F.2d 6\r                                                             \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1978).  The evidence here shows that Ortega's level\r\n\nof  involvement  was  greater  than  mere  knowledge  of  the\r\n\nsubstantive  crime and  thus suffices  to support  the jury's\r\n\nfinding that  there was an  intent to agree and  an intent to\r\n\ndistribute.   See United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 439-\r                                                      \r\n\n40  (1st Cir. 1994) (explaining  that Ocampo and Mehtala held\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nonly that defendant's mere presence at scene of crime or mere\r\n\nassociation  with  criminals  was  insufficient   to  support\r\n\nconspiracy conviction). \r\n\n          Ortega  also challenges the supplemental charge the\r\n\njudge  gave to  the  jury  when  it  announced  that  it  was\r\n\ndeadlocked  on  the  conspiracy   count.    The  trial  court\r\n\ncommitted  no error.  In fact, the judge recited verbatim the\r\n\nAllen-type charge recommended by  this court in United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Angiulo,  485 F.2d 37, 40  n.3 (1st Cir. 1973).   That the\r                      \r\n\njury  returned  a verdict  thirty  minutes later  is  not, as\r\n\nOrtega asserts, evidence of \"coercion.\" \r\n\n          Ortega's appeal of the  trial court's denial of her\r\n\nmotion  for new  trial fares no  better.  We  review only for\r\n\nabuse of  discretion or  misapplication of  law.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Rodriguez,  738 F.2d 13,  17 (1st Cir. 1984).   The\r                               \r\n\ndistrict court need only  order a new trial if  a miscarriage\r\n\nof justice  would  otherwise result.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nIndelicato,  611  F.2d  376, 387  (1st  Cir.  1979).   Ortega\r                      \r\n\npresents  no  claim  that  even  suggests  a  miscarriage  of\r\n\njustice.  Moreover, she does not recount any prejudicial acts\r\n\nthat  resulted in an unfair trial, see Payton v. Abbott Labs,\r                                                                        \r\n\n780  F.2d 147, 152-53 (1st  Cir. 1985), nor  does she contend\r\n\nthat the verdict was seriously  erroneous, see Borras v. Sea-\r                                                                         \r\n\nLand Serv., Inc., 586 F.2d 881,  887 (1st Cir. 1978).  It was\r                            \r\n\nwell within the court's discretion to deny the motion. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          Lastly,  Ortega  challenges  her  sentence  on  two\r\n\nequally  unsuccessful grounds, arguing  first that  the judge\r\n\nshould have  used the base  offense level for  powder cocaine\r\n\ninstead of  crack cocaine and, second, that  the court should\r\n\nhave  allowed a  downward departure  for  diminished capacity\r\n\nunder U.S.S.G.   5K2.13.   There is absolutely no support for\r\n\nOrtega's first  claim: the court, pursuant  to the Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines, calculated  the base  offense level based  on the\r\n\ndrug  involved in  the  crime.    See  U.S.S.G.     2D1.1(c).\r                                                 \r\n\nEvidence at trial showed that the drug was crack cocaine. \r\n\n          As  for  Ortega's  second  claim,  we  are  without\r\n\njurisdiction  to review  a discretionary  refusal  to depart.\r\n\nSee United States  v. Morrison,  46 F.3d 127,  130 (1st  Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1995);  see also United States v. Saldana, 109 F.3d 100, 102-\r                                                     \r\n\n03  (1st  Cir.  1997).   While  the  district  court did  not\r\n\nexplicitly  address  Ortega's   request  for  departure   for\r\n\ndiminished capacity, it is clear from the total circumstances\r\n\nof  the case  as well  as the  court's remarks  at sentencing\r\n\nthat, rather  than believing  it lacked authority  to depart,\r\n\nthe court simply declined to do so.  See Morrison, 46 F.3d at\r                                                             \r\n\n130.  Ortega has  advanced no colorable claim of  legal error\r\n\nthat would lead us to exercise jurisdiction here.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n",

She claims that  her trial  was\r\n\nflawed  in that the court  gave an improper  Allen charge and\r                                                              \r\n\nthat  there   was  insufficient   evidence  to  support   her\r\n\nconviction.   She  also  argues error  in  the trial  court's\r\n\ndenial of her motion for a new trial.  Finally, she  disputes\r\n\nthe court's determination of her sentence.  We affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          Ortega  was charged with distributing crack cocaine\r\n\nin violation  of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C.   2, and\r\n\nconspiracy  to distribute  crack cocaine  in violation  of 21\r\n\nU.S.C.     841(a)(1),  846.    Her  arrest resulted  from  an\r\n\nongoing   undercover   operation   conducted   by   the  Drug\r\n\nEnforcement Agency (\"DEA\").\r\n\n          Between  December  18  and  19,  1994,  Hector  San\r\n\nMartin, a DEA informant,  made arrangements to purchase crack\r\n\nfrom Julio Valdez at a Providence, Rhode Island, Burger King.\r\n\nAlthough Valdez himself had made a  previous drug delivery to\r\n\nSan  Martin several days  earlier, Valdez told  San Martin by\r\n\nphone  that this  time the  crack would  be delivered  in the\r\n\nBurger King  parking lot on  December 19  by a boy,  girl, or\r\n\nwoman.  The Burger King was located about a quarter mile from\r\n\nthe  apartment  Valdez  was  using  at  37  Labin  Street  in\r\n\nProvidence.    \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          On the day of  the deal, Valdez told San  Martin by\r\n\nphone that  a lady  in white  would deliver the  drugs.   The\r\n\n\"lady in white\" turned out to be Ortega.\r\n\n          That afternoon, DEA agents  conducting surveillance\r\n\nobserved  Valdez  and Ortega  emerge  from  the Labin  Street\r\n\napartment and walk together to the Burger King.  After Valdez\r\n\npointed  to San Martin's car, Ortega got into the front seat.\r\n\nValdez remained nearby to keep a lookout. \r\n\n          According  to San  Martin's testimony,  when Ortega\r\n\nentered  the car, he asked Ortega if she had \"the stuff,\" and\r\n\nshe replied \"yes.\"   She then pulled out a  clear plastic bag\r\n\ncontaining cocaine base from her inside jacket pocket.  After\r\n\nSan  Martin explained  that he wanted  to check  the quality,\r\n\nOrtega answered \"okay\" and handed the bag to him.  \r\n\n          Leaving  the crack bag on the floor of the car, San\r\n\nMartin told Ortega  that the money was  in the trunk  and got\r\n\nout.  At the sight of the raised trunk door -- the signal for\r\n\narrest  -- DEA agents moved  in to arrest  Valdez and Ortega.\r\n\nAfter  a  few seconds,  Ortega got  out  of the  car  and ran\r\n\nscreaming;  she was caught and arrested by one of the agents.\r\n\nValdez, who had also tried to run, was caught and arrested as\r\n\nwell. \r\n\n          In  her statement to  police, Ortega  complained of\r\n\nsevere neck pain due to a thyroid condition and said that she\r\n\nhad been at 37 Labin Street, her girlfriend's apartment, only\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nto rest.   She explained her  walk to the  Burger King as  an\r\n\nattempt to ease the pain.  As for the drug delivery, she said\r\n\nonly that  at some point  she was asked  to do a  \"favor\" and\r\n\nthat  because  of her  physical  pain, she  was  not thinking\r\n\nclearly.\r\n\n          On the second day of jury deliberations at Ortega's\r\n\ntrial,  the jury  informed the  court that  it had  reached a\r\n\nverdict  on all counts  but was deadlocked  on the conspiracy\r\n\ncount.     The  court  then  issued   a  supplemental  charge\r\n\ninstructing the jury to  go back and try to  reach a verdict.\r\n\nThirty minutes later,  the jury returned a guilty  verdict on\r\n\nthe conspiracy charge.\r\n\n          At sentencing,  the court  found that Ortega  had a\r\n\nbase offense level  of 32 based on the quantity  of crack she\r\n\nwas delivering  (84.3 grams) and a  criminal history category\r\n\nof  I.  The court then granted a two-level reduction pursuant\r\n\nto U.S.S.G.   5C1.2 and  a four-level reduction for  Ortega's\r\n\nminimal role in  the offense.   Thus, the  offense level  was\r\n\nreduced  from 32  to 26,  and defendant  was sentenced  to 63\r\n\nmonths in prison and 5 years of supervised release.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Ortega's   motion   for  acquittal   based   on  an\r\n\ninsufficient evidence  argument  was denied  by the  district\r\n\ncourt.  Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the\r\n\ngovernment,  a rational jury could  have found guilt beyond a\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nreasonable doubt.

Such  evidence  included  Valdez's\r\n\nstatement  to San  Martin that  a woman  wearing white  would\r\n\ndeliver the  drugs, Ortega's walk  with Valdez to  the Burger\r\n\nKing, Ortega's entrance into a stranger's car, and her prompt\r\n\ndelivery of a bag containing  crack previously hidden on  her\r\n\nbody, when asked for \"the stuff.\"   \r\n\n          This  case is  unlike  those Ortega  cites for  the\r\n\nproposition that  a single  drug transaction  is insufficient\r\n\nevidence of conspiracy.

DeLutis merely held that the single sale\r                                        \r\n\nthere  was insufficient  to tie  the defendant  buyer  to the\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nsellers' drug distribution  conspiracies.

A single sale  can\r\n\nestablish  a common  purpose on  the part  of the  sellers --\r\n\nhere, Ortega  and Valdez.   See Acevedo,  842 F.2d  at 506.  \r                                                   \r\n\nMoreover, in  DeLutis, there was no  direct or circumstantial\r                                 \r\n\nevidence that defendant intended  to agree to become involved\r\n\nin a larger supplier/distributor relationship, and there  was\r\n\nno basis  to infer based on  the single act in  question.  In\r\n\nIzzi,  there  was  no   evidence  of  agreement  linking  the\r                \r\n\ndefendant to the broader  conspiracy during the dates charged\r\n\nin the indictment.  Here, there  were only two members of the\r\n\nconspiracy, and  it is not  difficult to infer  knowledge and\r\n\nagreement.   \r\n\n          Other  cases  Ortega  cites  for  support  are also\r\n\ndistinguishable.

It was\r                            \r\n\nwell within the court's discretion to deny the motion. \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          Lastly,  Ortega  challenges  her  sentence  on  two\r\n\nequally  unsuccessful grounds, arguing  first that  the judge\r\n\nshould have  used the base  offense level for  powder cocaine\r\n\ninstead of  crack cocaine and, second, that  the court should\r\n\nhave  allowed a  downward departure  for  diminished capacity\r\n\nunder U.S.S.G.   5K2.13.   There is absolutely no support for\r\n\nOrtega's first  claim: the court, pursuant  to the Sentencing\r\n\nGuidelines, calculated  the base  offense level based  on the\r\n\ndrug  involved in  the  crime.    See  U.S.S.G.     2D1.1(c).\r                                                 \r\n\nEvidence at trial showed that the drug was crack cocaine. \r\n\n          As  for  Ortega's  second  claim,  we  are  without\r\n\njurisdiction  to review  a discretionary  refusal  to depart.\r\n\nSee United States  v.

While  the  district  court did  not\r\n\nexplicitly  address  Ortega's   request  for  departure   for\r\n\ndiminished capacity, it is clear from the total circumstances\r\n\nof  the case  as well  as the  court's remarks  at sentencing\r\n\nthat, rather  than believing  it lacked authority  to depart,\r\n\nthe court simply declined to do so.
