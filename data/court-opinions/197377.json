Appellant Vallejo-Serrano filed this employment\r                         \r\n\ndiscrimination lawsuit  against Cigna  Insurance Co.  and several\r\n\nsupervisors claiming  that he  was transferred to  an undesirable\r\n\nposition, and later refused  reinstatement after a medical leave,\r\n\nbecause  of his age and  disability.  The  district court granted\r\n\nsummary judgment for defendants.   It concluded that Vallejo  had\r\n\nfailed  to  establish  a  prima  facie  case  of  either  age  or\r\n\ndisability  discrimination, and that  he had failed  to show that\r\n\nthe company's proffered reasons  for its actions were pretextual.\r\n\nWe conclude that appellant failed to establish a prima facie case\r\n\non  the  disability  claim,  and  that  the  evidence  is  wholly\r\n\ninadequate to support an age discrimination claim.   We therefore\r\n\naffirm.  \r\n\n     The  parties  both  maintain  that  the  appropriateness  of\r\n\nsummary  judgment  turns  on  whether Vallejo  made  an  adequate\r\n\nshowing under the fourth  prong of the McDonnell  Douglas burden-\r                                                                   \r\n\nshifting paradigm, the first  three prongs concededly having been\r\n\nsatisfied.  See McDonnell  Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411  U.S. 792,\r                                                           \r\n\n802-05  (1973).   They  further  agree that,  for  the disability\r\n\ndiscrimination   claim,   this   model   required   appellant  to\r\n\ndemonstrate  that  he  was  replaced by  a  non-disabled  person.\r\n\nAlthough  appellant  asserts that  there  is at  least  a factual\r\n\ndispute concerning  whether he was \"replaced\"  by Felix Vazquez,1\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  Although Vallejo's  complaint  also asserts  that he  was\r\nreplaced  by Josefina  Bermudez and  her temporary  assistant, he\r\ndoes  not press this position on appeal, apparently because their\r\nduties were quite distinct.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nthe evidence does not  support his contention.  It  is undisputed\r\n\nthat Vazquez already held a position equivalent to appellant's in\r\n\nthe Accounting Department, and  that appellant was the accounting\r\n\nclerk  with the least seniority.   The fact  that Vazquez assumed\r\n\nmost  of  appellant's  tasks,   along  with  his  own  diminished\r\n\nworkload,   is  insufficient  to  establish  that  appellant  was\r\n\n\"replaced.\"   See LeBlanc v. Great American Ins. Co., 6 F.3d 836,\r                                                              \r\n\n846 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"A discharged employee `is not replaced when\r\n\nanother employee is assigned to perform the plaintiff's duties in\r\n\naddition to other duties, or when the work is redistributed among\r\n\nother    existing    employees    already   performing    related\r\n\nwork.'\"(citation omitted)).\r\n\n     As  for  the age  discrimination  claim,  which involves  an\r\n\nalleged   reduction  in  force,   the  burden-shifting  framework\r\n\nrequired  appellant to show either  that Cigna did  not treat age\r\n\nneutrally  or  that  it  retained  younger persons  in  the  same\r\n\nposition.    Arguably, Vallejo's  evidence  satisfied  the fourth\r\n\nprong  because  it  showed  that   the  others  retained  in  the\r\n\naccounting clerk positions were younger than him.  The  company's\r\n\nrationale,  however, was that he  was the least  senior person in\r\n\nthat position -- a fact he does not dispute.  Under the McDonnell\r                                                                           \r\n\nDouglas framework,  Vallejo needs to respond  to that explanation\r                 \r\n\nby  demonstrating that it  is a  pretext for  age discrimination.\r\n\nThe record,  however, makes  reference to  only  a single  remark\r\n\nconcerning age allegedly made by appellant's supervisor more than\r\n\na  year before his transfer from the Accounting Department.  This\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nis  insufficient to go to the jury.2   See LeBlanc, 6 F.3d at 843\r                                                            \r\n\n(\"[T]he plaintiff cannot avert summary  judgment if the record is\r\n\ndevoid  of  adequate   direct  or   circumstantial  evidence   of\r\n\ndiscriminatory animus on the part of the employer.\").3\r\n\n     The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.4\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2 Indeed, plaintiff did not make reference to this remark in\r\nhis  memorandum in  support  of  his  opposition to  the  summary\r\njudgment motion.\r\n\n     3 Although the district court's opinion in certain instances\r\nuses language that suggests factfinding, see, e.g., Opinion at 13\r                                                            \r\n(\"We  believe that plaintiff's age or disability was not a factor\r\nwhen Cigna decided to eliminate Mr. Vallejo's position, and later\r\ndeny him reinstatement\"; \"Cigna eliminated Mr. Vallejo's position\r\nbecause  the  Accounting  Department  could  operate  efficiently\r\nwithout  the  extra  accounting  clerk  position.\");  id.  at  15\r                                                                   \r\n(\"Cigna's refusal  to reinstate plaintiff after  his release from\r\nthe SIF  was not of a discriminatory  animus.\"), it is clear from\r\nthe opinion as a  whole that the court  found as a matter of  law\r                                                                           \r\nthat Vallejo had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to send the\r\ncase  to a factfinder.   We note  that the court's  task was made\r\nmore difficult by  the plaintiff's failure  to file the  required\r\nseparate statement of contested facts.\r\n\n     4 Vallejo  also alleged  a  retaliation claim  based on  his\r\nhaving filed a complaint with the Anti-Discrimination Unit of the\r\nLabor Department  following his  transfer in September  1993, and\r\nthe company's  subsequent refusal  to reinstate him  in September\r\n1994.   The  decision not  to reinstate  him was  consistent with\r\nCommonwealth  law, however, and there is no support in the record\r\nfor a finding that it was motivated by retaliatory animus.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n",
