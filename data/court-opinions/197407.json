Jack Markarian, against whom\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nappellee  Aetna  Casualty  and  Surety Company  has  a  civil\r\n\njudgment,  appeals from  the  entry of  a  writ of  ne  exeat\r                                                                         \r\n\nagainst  him.   The  writ, which  is  essentially a  form  of\r\n\nequitable  bail,  was issued  ex  parte  in the  District  of\r\n\nMassachusetts in  February 1995.  It  prohibits Markarian, an\r\n\nAmerican citizen who is employed and lives with his family in\r\n\nMassachusetts, from leaving the state or removing  any of his\r\n\nassets from  the state without  the court's permission.   The\r\n\nwrit required Markarian to surrender his passport to a United\r\n\nStates Marshal, and  violation of its terms is  punishable by\r\n\ndetention in a federal facility.\r\n\n          Markarian    raises     federal    statutory    and\r\n\nconstitutional objections  to the issuance  of the writ.   We\r\n\nvacate the writ  without reaching the constitutional  issues,\r\n\nalthough  they  are not  frivolous.   The  writ of  ne exeat,\r                                                                        \r\n\ngoverned by Fed. R. Civ.  P. 69 and Mass. R. Civ.  P. 4.3(c),\r\n\nis  not available as a  tool in an  ordinary civil collection\r\n\naction like this.   It  may only issue  in furtherance of  \"a\r\n\njudgment  or order requiring  the performance of  an act, the\r\n\nneglect or  refusal to perform  which would be  punishable by\r\n\nthe court as a contempt.\"  Mass. R. Civ. P. 4.3(c).   The All\r\n\nWrits  Act, 28  U.S.C.    1651, does  not  negate this  state\r\n\nrequirement for issuance of the writ.\r\n\n                              I.\r\r\n\n          The facts of the underlying civil action brought by\r\n\nAetna  against  Markarian are  of  little  importance to  the\r\n\npresent appeal.  Suffice it to  say that Aetna was the victim\r\n\nof  a fraudulent  autobody insurance  claim scheme,  and that\r\n\nMarkarian along  with some  relatives and the  companies they\r\n\ncontrolled were the perpetrators of the scheme.  A e t n a\r\n\nbrought  suit in  federal  district  court in  Massachusetts,\r\n\nasserting claims under civil RICO,  Massachusetts common law,\r\n\nand the  Massachusetts deceptive trade practices  statute.  A\r\n\njury  found in  Aetna's favor  on most of  the claims  in the\r\n\ncomplaint, and  in November  1993 the district  court entered\r\n\njudgment holding Markarian and  his 22 co-defendants  jointly\r\n\nand severally liable for over $6 million.  Markarian and some\r\n\nof  the defendants  were also  found individually  liable for\r\n\nover $1.5 million under Mass. Gen. Laws Ch. 93A.   This court\r\n\naffirmed  the judgment in December  1994.  Aetna  Cas. &amp; Sur.\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo. v. P &amp; B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                 \r\n\n          Judgment  in  hand, Aetna  sought  to identify  and\r\n\nseize  assets.     It   commenced  a  supplementary   process\r\n\nproceeding  in federal  court under  Fed. R.  Civ. P.  69 and\r\n\nMass. Gen. Laws Ch.  224,   14 seeking an  order transferring\r\n\nownership of Markarian's non-exempt assets.  Aetna also filed\r\n\nan  ex parte  application  for  the  writ  of  ne  exeat  and\r                                                                    \r\n\nsupported it  with an   affidavit stating that  Markarian and\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nhis co-defendants were secreting assets to render them immune\r\n\nto supplementary process.\r\n\n          The district court  issued the writ of  ne exeat in\r                                                                      \r\n\nFebruary 1995, finding  that Markarian and  his co-defendants\r\n\nhad been moving  assets out of the jurisdiction as part of an\r\n\neffort to prevent enforcement of the judgment and  that there\r\n\nwas  a strong likelihood that  they would continue  to do so.\r\n\nThe  district court also  found that  there was  an immediate\r\n\nlikelihood   that   the   co-defendants  would   depart   the\r\n\njurisdiction or the United States.\r\n\n          In March 1995, Markarian appealed from the writ and\r\n\nfiled  a suggestion  of  bankruptcy.   The bankruptcy  filing\r\n\nresulted in  an automatic  stay of the  supplementary process\r\n\nproceedings,  see 11  U.S.C.    362(a), and  later in  March,\r                             \r\n\nMarkarian moved this court to stay the appeal from the writ.1\r\n\nThis court issued an order holding the appeal in abeyance and\r\n\ndirecting counsel to report back after the  decision from the\r\n\nbankruptcy court.   Markarian then  moved to vacate  the writ\r\n\nbefore the bankruptcy court,  which denied the motion without\r\n\nprejudice in November 1995 and referred Markarian back to the\r\n\ndistrict  court.   See  In re  Jack  Markarian, No.  95-40961\r                                                          \r\n\n(Bankr. D. Mass. Nov. 20, 1995).\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  The writ does not appear to fall within  the terms of the\r\nAutomatic  Stay  provision of  the  Bankruptcy  Code, see  11\r                                                                     \r\nU.S.C.    362, and thus the writ and the appeal from the writ\r\nwere not stayed automatically by the bankruptcy filing.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n          The district court in March 1996 denied Markarian's\r\n\nmotion   to  vacate   the  writ,   stating  that   it  lacked\r\n\njurisdiction   over  the   matter.     Markarian   moved  for\r\n\nclarification of this ruling.  While that motion was pending,\r\n\nin  July 1996,  the bankruptcy  court ruled  that Markarian's\r\n\ndebts to Aetna were not dischargeable because they  arose out\r\n\nof fraud.  See In re Jack Markarian, No. 95-40961 (Bankr.  D.\r                                               \r\n\nMass. Jul. 31, 1996).   However, the bankruptcy court  deemed\r\n\nthe   issue  close   enough  to   stay  the  order   of  non-\r\n\ndischargeability and  certify the  case to the  First Circuit\r\n\nBankruptcy  Appellate Panel,  where it  is  now pending.   In\r\n\nOctober  1996, the  district  court,  ruling  on  Markarian's\r\n\nmotion for clarification of the refusal to vacate the writ of\r\n\nne exeat, denied  the motion \"on the  merits\" without opinion\r                    \r\n\nor findings.  This appeal followed.\r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n          Aetna   argues   that   there   is   no   appellate\r\n\njurisdiction,   saying  the   writ   is  no   more  than   an\r\n\ninterlocutory  order to  preserve assets  until  its separate\r\n\nsupplementary  process  proceedings  against   Markarian  are\r\n\ncompleted.2   We disagree.   At issue is  not a supplementary\r\n\nprocess order but a writ of  ne exeat:  Aetna's motion papers\r                                                 \r\n\nand  the  order  issuing  the   writ  make  no  reference  to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The supplementary process proceedings cannot resume until\r\nthe conclusion of the  bankruptcy proceedings unless the stay\r\nis lifted.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nsupplementary process, and the  writ, by its terms,  does not\r\n\nexpire with  the  termination of  the  supplementary  process\r\n\nproceedings.   The  writ  is effectively  an injunction  over\r\n\nwhich  this  court has  jurisdiction  pursuant  to 28  U.S.C.\r\n\n  1292(a).  See  United States v. Shaheen, 445 F.2d 6, 7 (7th\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1971).  We also note Markarian's argument  that issuance\r\n\nof the  writ was an error of law,  and thus the writ may well\r\n\nbe an appealable collateral order.  See id. at 7 n.2.\r                                                       \r\n\n                             III.\r\n\n          Where a money judgment  has been entered in federal\r\n\ncourt, enforcement  of the  judgment is governed  by Fed.  R.\r\n\nCiv. P. 69, which provides that the procedures to be used are\r\n\nthose of the state  in which the district court  sits, unless\r\n\nthere is an applicable federal statute.  Aetna availed itself\r\n\nof state process, seeking a writ of ne exeat.\r                                                        \r\n\n          Massachusetts  procedure  permits  issuance of  the\r\n\nwrit only in support of an order punishable by the court as a\r\n\ncontempt.  See Mass. R. Civ.  P. 4.3(c).  A money judgment is\r                          \r\n\nnot  such an order.3  \"[T]he writ  of ne exeat has never been\r                                                          \r\n\nissued  in aid  of  legal, as  distinguished from  equitable,\r\n\nprocess,  or for  the purpose  of obtaining  security from  a\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  The Massachusetts supplementary process statute, however,\r\nprovides that violation of  a supplementary process order may\r\nbe punishable as a contempt.  See Mass. Gen. Laws  Ch. 224,  \r                                             \r\n16.   We do not reach the question of whether the writ may be\r\nused  after a supplementary process order has been issued and\r\nthere has been a violation.  That is not the case here.\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\ndefendant in  at action of  law.\"   Moore v.

Lundy, 584  F.2d 559, 560  (1st\r                                               \r\n\nCir.  1978)   (failure   to  comply   with  state   procedure\r\n\ninvalidated writ of execution).\r\n\n          These  are not  mere formalisms.    The writ  of ne\r                                                                         \r\n\nexeat is an ancient writ.   It hearkens back to the days when\r                 \r\n\ndebtors  were imprisoned for failure to pay their debts.  The\r\n\nwrit is itself a form  of civil arrest.  Caselaw on  the writ\r\n\nhas narrowed  its use to situations  resulting from equitable\r\n\ndebt rather than  debts recoverable at law.  See 65 C.J.S. Ne\r                                                                         \r\n\nExeat    4,  at  396  (1966).

The  Massachusetts  courts, recognizing  that the  writ\r\n\noperates in  restraint of personal liberties,  have held that\r\n\nthe writ  \"is to  be  granted with  caution\"  and \"is  to  be\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\ncontinued  in force with caution.\"  Cohen v.

Rule  69 does  not provide  that\r\n\nground independently, because it  directs that \"[p]rocess  to\r\n\nenforce a judgment for  the payment of money shall be  a writ\r\n\nof  execution,  unless  the  court directs  otherwise.

One such  situation is where an  action for contempt has\r\nbeen instituted for  failure to pay an  obligation imposed by\r\nstatute in order to  enforce the public policies  embodied in\r\nthe  statutory scheme.    See, e.g.,  McComb v.  Jacksonville\r                                                                         \r\nPaper Co., 336  U.S. 187,  193-95 (1949).

A third is where the judgment is against a\r\nstate which  refuses to appropriate funds  through the normal\r\nprocess  provided  by  state  law.     See,  e.g.,  Spain  v.\r                                                                     \r\nMountanos, 690 F.2d 742,  744-45 (9th Cir. 1982); Gary  W. v.\r                                                                      \r\nLouisiana, 622 F.2d 804,  806 (5th Cir. 1980).

The  All Writs Act \"does not  authorize [federal\r\n\ncourts]  to  issue  ad  hoc writs  whenever  compliance  with\r\n\nstatutory   procedures   appears    inconvenient   or    less\r\n\nappropriate.\"   Pennsylvania Bureau  of Correction  v.

Where,  as\r                                 \r\n\nhere, there  is  a statutory  procedure  which  \"specifically\r\n\naddresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority,\r\n\nand  not  the  All Writs  Act,  that  is  controlling.\"   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\nIndeed, there is every  reason not to reach  to find the  All\r\n\nWrits Act applicable where \"the courts have consistently read\r\n\nRule 69(a) as limiting all federal process on money judgments\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\nuncooperativeness of the judgment debtor are not the types of\r\nextraordinary  circumstances which warrant departure from the\r\ngeneral rule  that money judgments  are enforced by  means of\r\nwrits  of execution  rather than  by  resort to  the contempt\r\npower of the courts.

The writ, which is essentially a form of equitable bail, was issued ex parte in the District of Massachusetts in February 1995.  It prohibits Markarian, an American citizen who is employed and lives with his family in Massachusetts, from leaving the state or removing any of his assets from the state without the court's permission.  The writ required Markarian to surrender his passport to a United States Marshal, and violation of its terms is punishable by detention in a federal facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Markarian raises federal statutory and constitutional objections to the issuance of the writ.  We vacate the writ without reaching the constitutional issues, although they are not frivolous.  The writ of ne exeat, governed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 69 and Mass.  R. Civ. P. 4.3(c), is not available as a tool in an ordinary civil collection action like this.  It may only issue in furtherance of \"a judgment or order requiring the performance of an act, the neglect or refusal to perform which would be punishable by the court as a contempt.\"  Mass. R. Civ. P. 4.3(c).  The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, does not negate this state requirement for issuance of the writ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of the underlying civil action brought by Aetna against Markarian are of little importance to the present appeal.  Suffice it to say that Aetna was the victim of a fraudulent autobody insurance claim scheme, and that Markarian along with some relatives and the companies they controlled were the perpetrators of the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aetna brought suit in federal district court in Massachusetts, asserting claims under civil RICO, Massachusetts common law, and the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices statute.  A jury found in Aetna's favor on most of the claims in the complaint, and in November 1993 the district court entered judgment holding Markarian and his 22 co-defendants jointly and severally liable for over $6 million.  Markarian and some of the defendants were also found individually liable for over $1.5 million under Mass.  Gen. Laws Ch. 93A.  This court affirmed the judgment in December 1994.  Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. P &amp; B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment in hand, Aetna sought to identify and seize assets.  It commenced a supplementary process proceeding in federal court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 69 and Mass.  Gen. Laws Ch. 224, &#167; 14 seeking an order transferring ownership of Markarian's non-exempt assets.  Aetna also filed an ex parte application for the writ of ne exeat and supported it with an affidavit stating that Markarian and his co-defendants were secreting assets to render them immune to supplementary process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued the writ of ne exeat in February 1995, finding that Markarian and his co-defendants had been moving assets out of the jurisdiction as part of an effort to prevent enforcement of the judgment and that there was a strong likelihood that they would continue to do so.  The district court also found that there was an immediate likelihood that the co-defendants would depart the jurisdiction or the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1995, Markarian appealed from the writ and filed a suggestion of bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy filing resulted in an automatic stay of the supplementary process proceedings, see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a), and later in March, Markarian moved this court to stay the appeal from the writ.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This court issued an order holding the appeal in abeyance and directing counsel to report back after the decision from the bankruptcy court.  Markarian then moved to vacate the writ before the bankruptcy court, which denied the motion without prejudice in November 1995 and referred Markarian back to the district court.  See In re Jack Markarian, No. 95-40961 (Bankr.D.Mass. Nov. 20, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in March 1996 denied Markarian's motion to vacate the writ, stating that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter.  Markarian moved for clarification of this ruling.  While that motion was pending, in July 1996, the bankruptcy court ruled that Markarian's debts to Aetna were not dischargeable because they arose out of fraud.  See In re Jack Markarian, No. 95-40961 (Bankr.D.Mass. Jul. 31, 1996).  However, the bankruptcy court deemed the issue close enough to stay the order of non-dischargeability and certify the case to the First Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, where it is now pending.  In October 1996, the district court, ruling on Markarian's motion for clarification of the refusal to vacate the writ of ne exeat, denied the motion \"on the merits\" without opinion or findings.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aetna argues that there is no appellate jurisdiction, saying the writ is no more than an interlocutory order to preserve assets until its separate supplementary process proceedings against Markarian are completed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We disagree.  At issue is not a supplementary process order but a writ of ne exeat:  Aetna's motion papers and the order issuing the writ make no reference to supplementary process, and the writ, by its terms, does not expire with the termination of the supplementary process proceedings.  The writ is effectively an injunction over which this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;   1292(a).  See United States v. Shaheen, 445 F.2d 6, 7 (7th Cir.1971).  We also note Markarian's argument that issuance of the writ was an error of law, and thus the writ may well be an appealable collateral order.  See id. at 7 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a money judgment has been entered in federal court, enforcement of the judgment is governed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 69, which provides that the procedures to be used are those of the state in which the district court sits, unless there is an applicable federal statute.  Aetna availed itself of state process, seeking a writ of ne exeat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts procedure permits issuance of the writ only in support of an order punishable by the court as a contempt.  See Mass.  R. Civ. P. 4.3(c).  A money judgment is not such an order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  \"[T]he writ of ne exeat has never been issued in aid of legal, as distinguished from equitable, process, or for the purpose of obtaining security from a defendant in at action of law.\"  Moore v. Valda, 151 Mass. 363, 23 N.E. 1102, 1103 (1890) (per curiam).  \"[W]hen a party fails to satisfy a court-imposed money judgment the appropriate remedy is a writ of execution, not a finding of contempt.\"  Combs v. Ryan's Coal Co., 785 F.2d 970, 980 (11th Cir.1986);  see also Shuffler v. Heritage Bank, 720 F.2d 1141, 1147-48 (9th Cir.1983).  It follows that the issuance of the writ was error.  See Gabovitch v. Lundy, 584 F.2d 559, 560 (1st Cir.1978) (failure to comply with state procedure invalidated writ of execution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are not mere formalisms.  The writ of ne exeat is an ancient writ.  It hearkens back to the days when debtors were imprisoned for failure to pay their debts.  The writ is itself a form of civil arrest.  Caselaw on the writ has narrowed its use to situations resulting from equitable debt rather than debts recoverable at law.  See 65 C.J.S. Ne Exeat &#167; 4, at 396 (1966).  The Massachusetts rule is similarly circumscribed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Reporter's Notes to the Massachusetts rule providing for the writ of ne exeat express concern about the constitutionality of the writ, even circumscribed as it is.  The Massachusetts courts, recognizing that the writ operates in restraint of personal liberties, have held that the writ \"is to be granted with caution\" and \"is to be continued in force with caution.\"  Cohen v. Cohen, 319 Mass. 31, 64 N.E.2d 689, 693 (1946).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aetna's motion for a writ of ne exeat finds no ground on which to rest.  Rule 69 does not provide that ground independently, because it directs that \"[p]rocess to enforce a judgment for the payment of money shall be a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise.  The procedure on execution ... shall be in accordance with the practice and procedure of the state in which the district court is held....\"  The \"otherwise\" clause is narrowly construed.  See Combs, 785 F.2d at 980.   It does not authorize enforcement of a civil money judgment by methods other than a writ of execution, except where \"well established principles [so] warrant.\"   13 J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice p 69.02, at 69-5 to -7 (3d ed.1997);  see also Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, 95 F.3d 848, 854 (9th Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has held that \"the legislative history and judicial application of Rule 69(a) make clear that the first sentence of the Rule expresses a limitation on the means of enforcement of money judgments and does not create a general power to issue writs of execution in disregard of the state law incorporated by the rest of the Rule.\"  Gabovitch, 584 F.2d at 560-61.   The state remedy is the exclusive route here.  See id. at 561.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aetna also points to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, but does not develop its argument.  The point is not well taken.  The All Writs Act \"does not authorize [federal courts] to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.\"  Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 43, 106 S.Ct. 355, 361, 88 L.Ed.2d 189 (1985).  Where, as here, there is a statutory procedure which \"specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\"  Id. Indeed, there is every reason not to reach to find the All Writs Act applicable where \"the courts have consistently read Rule 69(a) as limiting all federal process on money judgments to the type of process available under state law.\"  Gabovitch, 584 F.2d at 561.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This opinion does not condone Markarian's failure to pay his judgment debt, nor does it fail to appreciate Aetna's frustration.

See Mass.  Gen. Laws Ch. 224, &#167; 16.  We do not reach the question of whether the writ may be used after a supplementary process order has been issued and there has been a violation.  That is not the case here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> One such situation is where an action for contempt has been instituted for failure to pay an obligation imposed by statute in order to enforce the public policies embodied in the statutory scheme.  See, e.g., McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. 187, 193-95, 69 S.Ct. 497, 500-01, 93 L.Ed. 599 (1949).  Another is where there has been a congressional determination to provide the government with the ability to seek a writ of ne exeat in furtherance of enforcing tax obligations.  See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7402(a).  A third is where the judgment is against a state which refuses to appropriate funds through the normal process provided by state law.  See, e.g., Spain v. Mountanos, 690 F.2d 742, 744-45 (9th Cir.1982);  Gary W. v. Louisiana, 622 F.2d 804, 806 (5th Cir.1980).  In contrast, the size of the award and the difficulties in enforcing the judgment due to the location of the assets and the uncooperativeness of the judgment debtor are not the types of extraordinary circumstances which warrant departure from the general rule that money judgments are enforced by means of writs of execution rather than by resort to the contempt power of the courts.

The writ, which is essentially a form of equitable bail, was issued ex parte in the District of Massachusetts in February 1995.  It prohibits Markarian, an American citizen who is employed and lives with his family in Massachusetts, from leaving the state or removing any of his assets from the state without the court's permission.  The writ required Markarian to surrender his passport to a United States Marshal, and violation of its terms is punishable by detention in a federal facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Markarian raises federal statutory and constitutional objections to the issuance of the writ.  We vacate the writ without reaching the constitutional issues, although they are not frivolous.  The writ of ne exeat, governed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 69 and Mass.  R. Civ. P. 4.3(c), is not available as a tool in an ordinary civil collection action like this.  It may only issue in furtherance of \"a judgment or order requiring the performance of an act, the neglect or refusal to perform which would be punishable by the court as a contempt.\"  Mass. R. Civ. P. 4.3(c).  The All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, does not negate this state requirement for issuance of the writ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of the underlying civil action brought by Aetna against Markarian are of little importance to the present appeal.  Suffice it to say that Aetna was the victim of a fraudulent autobody insurance claim scheme, and that Markarian along with some relatives and the companies they controlled were the perpetrators of the scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aetna brought suit in federal district court in Massachusetts, asserting claims under civil RICO, Massachusetts common law, and the Massachusetts deceptive trade practices statute.  A jury found in Aetna's favor on most of the claims in the complaint, and in November 1993 the district court entered judgment holding Markarian and his 22 co-defendants jointly and severally liable for over $6 million.  Markarian and some of the defendants were also found individually liable for over $1.5 million under Mass.  Gen. Laws Ch. 93A.  This court affirmed the judgment in December 1994.  Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. P &amp; B Autobody, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686425\"><a href=\"/opinion/686425/aetna-casualty-surety-company-v-p-b-autobody-arsenal-auto-repairs/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1546</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Judgment in hand, Aetna sought to identify and seize assets.  It commenced a supplementary process proceeding in federal court under Fed.R.Civ.P. 69 and Mass.  Gen. Laws Ch. 224, &#167; 14 seeking an order transferring ownership of Markarian's non-exempt assets.  Aetna also filed an ex parte application for the writ of ne exeat and supported it with an affidavit stating that Markarian and his co-defendants were secreting assets to render them immune to supplementary process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued the writ of ne exeat in February 1995, finding that Markarian and his co-defendants had been moving assets out of the jurisdiction as part of an effort to prevent enforcement of the judgment and that there was a strong likelihood that they would continue to do so.  The district court also found that there was an immediate likelihood that the co-defendants would depart the jurisdiction or the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1995, Markarian appealed from the writ and filed a suggestion of bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy filing resulted in an automatic stay of the supplementary process proceedings, see 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a), and later in March, Markarian moved this court to stay the appeal from the writ.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  This court issued an order holding the appeal in abeyance and directing counsel to report back after the decision from the bankruptcy court.  Markarian then moved to vacate the writ before the bankruptcy court, which denied the motion without prejudice in November 1995 and referred Markarian back to the district court.  See In re Jack Markarian, No. 95-40961 (Bankr.D.Mass. Nov. 20, 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court in March 1996 denied Markarian's motion to vacate the writ, stating that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter.  Markarian moved for clarification of this ruling.  While that motion was pending, in July 1996, the bankruptcy court ruled that Markarian's debts to Aetna were not dischargeable because they arose out of fraud.  See In re Jack Markarian, No. 95-40961 (Bankr.D.Mass. Jul. 31, 1996).  However, the bankruptcy court deemed the issue close enough to stay the order of non-dischargeability and certify the case to the First Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel, where it is now pending.  In October 1996, the district court, ruling on Markarian's motion for clarification of the refusal to vacate the writ of ne exeat, denied the motion \"on the merits\" without opinion or findings.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aetna argues that there is no appellate jurisdiction, saying the writ is no more than an interlocutory order to preserve assets until its separate supplementary process proceedings against Markarian are completed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  We disagree.  At issue is not a supplementary process order but a writ of ne exeat:  Aetna's motion papers and the order issuing the writ make no reference to supplementary process, and the writ, by its terms, does not expire with the termination of the supplementary process proceedings.  The writ is effectively an injunction over which this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167;   1292(a).  See United States v. Shaheen, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"297671\"><a href=\"/opinion/297671/united-states-v-thomas-a-shaheen/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 7 (7th Cir.1971).  We also note Markarian's argument that issuance of the writ was an error of law, and thus the writ may well be an appealable collateral order.  See id. at 7 n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a money judgment has been entered in federal court, enforcement of the judgment is governed by Fed.R.Civ.P. 69, which provides that the procedures to be used are those of the state in which the district court sits, unless there is an applicable federal statute.  Aetna availed itself of state process, seeking a writ of ne exeat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts procedure permits issuance of the writ only in support of an order punishable by the court as a contempt.  See Mass.  R. Civ. P. 4.3(c).  A money judgment is not such an order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  \"[T]he writ of ne exeat has never been issued in aid of legal, as distinguished from equitable, process, or for the purpose of obtaining security from a defendant in at action of law.\"  Moore v. Valda, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">363</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></span>, 1103 (1890) (per curiam).  \"[W]hen a party fails to satisfy a court-imposed money judgment the appropriate remedy is a writ of execution, not a finding of contempt.\"  Combs v. Ryan's Coal Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"466181\"><a href=\"/opinion/466181/harrison-combs-john-j-oconnell-and-paul-r-dean-as-trustees-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">785</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></a></span>, 980 (11th Cir.1986);  see also Shuffler v. Heritage Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"427080\"><a href=\"/opinion/427080/rex-l-shuffler-and-betty-l-shuffler-v-heritage-bank-a-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">720</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span>, 1147-48 (9th Cir.1983).  It follows that the issuance of the writ was error.  See Gabovitch v. Lundy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"359877\"><a href=\"/opinion/359877/william-gabovitch-v-maurice-a-lundy/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">559</span></a></span>, 560 (1st Cir.1978) (failure to comply with state procedure invalidated writ of execution).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These are not mere formalisms.  The writ of ne exeat is an ancient writ.  It hearkens back to the days when debtors were imprisoned for failure to pay their debts.  The writ is itself a form of civil arrest.  Caselaw on the writ has narrowed its use to situations resulting from equitable debt rather than debts recoverable at law.  See 65 C.J.S. Ne Exeat &#167; 4, at 396 (1966).  The Massachusetts rule is similarly circumscribed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, the Reporter's Notes to the Massachusetts rule providing for the writ of ne exeat express concern about the constitutionality of the writ, even circumscribed as it is.  The Massachusetts courts, recognizing that the writ operates in restraint of personal liberties, have held that the writ \"is to be granted with caution\" and \"is to be continued in force with caution.\"  Cohen v. Cohen, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></span>, 693 (1946).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aetna's motion for a writ of ne exeat finds no ground on which to rest.  Rule 69 does not provide that ground independently, because it directs that \"[p]rocess to enforce a judgment for the payment of money shall be a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise.  The procedure on execution ... shall be in accordance with the practice and procedure of the state in which the district court is held....\"  The \"otherwise\" clause is narrowly construed.  See Combs, 785 F.2d at 980.   It does not authorize enforcement of a civil money judgment by methods other than a writ of execution, except where \"well established principles [so] warrant.\"   13 J. Moore, Moore's Federal Practice p 69.02, at 69-5 to -7 (3d ed.1997);  see also Hilao v. Estate of Marcos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"726149\"><a href=\"/opinion/726149/celsa-hilao-v-estate-of-ferdinand-e-marcos-and-swiss-bank-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span>, 854 (9th Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has held that \"the legislative history and judicial application of Rule 69(a) make clear that the first sentence of the Rule expresses a limitation on the means of enforcement of money judgments and does not create a general power to issue writs of execution in disregard of the state law incorporated by the rest of the Rule.\"  Gabovitch, 584 F.2d at 560-61.   The state remedy is the exclusive route here.  See id. at 561.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aetna also points to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, but does not develop its argument.  The point is not well taken.  The All Writs Act \"does not authorize [federal courts] to issue ad hoc writs whenever compliance with statutory procedures appears inconvenient or less appropriate.\"  Pennsylvania Bureau of Correction v. United States Marshals Serv., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111538\"><a href=\"/opinion/111538/pa-bureau-of-correction-v-us-marshals-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111538\"><a href=\"/opinion/111538/pa-bureau-of-correction-v-us-marshals-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span> (1985).  Where, as here, there is a statutory procedure which \"specifically addresses the particular issue at hand, it is that authority, and not the All Writs Act, that is controlling.\"  Id. Indeed, there is every reason not to reach to find the All Writs Act applicable where \"the courts have consistently read Rule 69(a) as limiting all federal process on money judgments to the type of process available under state law.\"  Gabovitch, 584 F.2d at 561.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This opinion does not condone Markarian's failure to pay his judgment debt, nor does it fail to appreciate Aetna's frustration.  It simply holds that the legal predicate for issuance of the extraordinary writ of ne exeat is lacking and so issuance of the writ was error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order granting the writ is reversed and the writ is vacated.

See Mass.  Gen. Laws Ch. 224, &#167; 16.  We do not reach the question of whether the writ may be used after a supplementary process order has been issued and there has been a violation.  That is not the case here</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> One such situation is where an action for contempt has been instituted for failure to pay an obligation imposed by statute in order to enforce the public policies embodied in the statutory scheme.  See, e.g., McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104630\"><a href=\"/opinion/104630/mccomb-v-jacksonville-paper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 193-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104630\"><a href=\"/opinion/104630/mccomb-v-jacksonville-paper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></span> (1949).  Another is where there has been a congressional determination to provide the government with the ability to seek a writ of ne exeat in furtherance of enforcing tax obligations.  See, e.g., 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7402(a).  A third is where the judgment is against a state which refuses to appropriate funds through the normal process provided by state law.  See, e.g., Spain v. Mountanos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409481\"><a href=\"/opinion/409481/johnny-l-spain-v-louis-mountanos-and-kenneth-cory-controller-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">690</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 744-45 (9th Cir.1982);  Gary W. v. Louisiana, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"378894\"><a href=\"/opinion/378894/gary-w-etc-v-state-of-louisiana-etc-dr-william-cherry-secretary-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 806 (5th Cir.1980).  In contrast, the size of the award and the difficulties in enforcing the judgment due to the location of the assets and the uncooperativeness of the judgment debtor are not the types of extraordinary circumstances which warrant departure from the general rule that money judgments are enforced by means of writs of execution rather than by resort to the contempt power of the courts.
