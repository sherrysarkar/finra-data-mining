McCloskey, United States Attorney, James Moore,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and F. Mark Terison, Assistant U.S.\r\nAttorney, on brief for appellee. \r\n\nSEPTEMBER 11, 1998\r\n\n                                                Per Curiam.  Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we find no reason to disturb the sentence imposed on\r\nremand after defendant's first appeal, United States v. Damon,\r\n127 F.3d 139 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\n          We reject defendant's contention that he was entitled\r\nto the benefit of U.S.S.G.  2K2.1(b)(2).  In light of the\r\nrelevant surrounding circumstances, including defendant's prior\r\nconviction for threatening a victim by pointing a Colt .45 at\r\nhis head, the district court did not clearly err in determining\r\nthat defendant did not possess the same or similar Colt .45\r\nsolely as a collector or that he had used it for unlawful\r\npurposes.  See  2K2.1, application note 10; United States v.\r\nCousens, 942 F.2d 800, 802 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n          We also reject defendant's contention that the\r\ndistrict court was required to explain its choice of a sentence\r\nn the middle of the applicable guideline range.  See Williamsv. United States, 503 U.S. 193, 205 (1992).  Nothing in the\r\nrecord suggests to us any retaliatory motive.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
