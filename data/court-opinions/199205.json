Martineau and Richard D. Hewes, with whom Hewes\n& Hewes was on brief, for appellant.\n     William D. Hewitt, with whom Catherine R. Connors and Pierce\nAtwood were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         December 21, 2000\n\n\n\n____________\n*Of the District of Rhode Island, sitting by designation.\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge.         This appeal evolves from a\n\ntragic highway accident in which a motorcycle driven by David M.\n\nMaurice collided with an automobile operated by Bonnie Pike.\n\nMaurice    was   killed.    After   securing   an   appointment   as    the\n\npersonal representative of his estate, his widow, plaintiff-\n\nappellant Tina L. Maurice, asserted a variety of claims arising\n\nout of her husband's death.\n\n            Pike had only modest insurance.         Her carrier paid the\n\nappellant its policy limit:     $50,000.    The appellant then turned\n\nto defendant-appellee State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance\n\nCompany (State Farm).      At the time of the accident, the Maurices\n\nowned three vehicles (including the motorcycle).               Each was\n\ncovered by a separate State Farm policy.        The appellant tried to\n\n\"stack\" the policies, demanding payment of the policy limits for\n\nuninsured/underinsured motorist (UM) coverage under all three\n\npolices.     As regards the non-motorcycle policies, State Farm\n\nrefused, citing the so-called other owned vehicle exclusion (the\n\nOOV exclusion) that appeared in each of those policies.1               That\n\nexclusion reads:\n\n\n\n    1State Farm did, however, pay for property damage to the\nmotorcycle as provided under the motorcycle policy.     It also\npaid an accidental death benefit of $5,000 under one of the\nother policies. Neither of those payments is in dispute in this\nappeal, nor is the availability of UM coverage under the\nmotorcycle policy.\n\n                                    -2-\n\f            THERE IS NO COVERAGE\n                         *        *       *\n            2. FOR BODILY INJURY TO AN INSURED:\n                   a.   WHILE OCCUPYING A MOTOR\n                   VEHICLE OWNED BY YOU, YOUR\n                   SPOUSE OR ANY RELATIVE IF IT\n                   IS   NOT  INSURED   FOR   THIS\n                   COVERAGE UNDER THIS POLICY . .\n                   . .\n\n(Emphasis omitted).\n\n            Undaunted by the plain language of the OOV exclusion,\n\nthe appellant sued.    Acting on her own behalf and on behalf of\n\nher late husband's estate, she brought an action for damages\n\nagainst State Farm in a Maine court.      She cited State Farm's\n\nrefusal to pay under the UM coverages and alleged, inter alia,\n\nbreach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair\n\ndealing.    State Farm removed the action to the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Maine.       See 28 U.S.C. §§\n\n1332(a), 1441.    In due course, it moved for dismissal.   Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).      In an unpublished memorandum, Magistrate\n\nJudge Cohen recommended granting the motion.    At the same time,\n\nhe recommended denying the appellant's motion for leave to file\n\nan amended complaint (the ostensible purpose of which was to add\n\na count for respondeat     superior liability based on certain\n\nactions of the insurance agent who had handled the Maurices'\n\naccount).\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f              The appellant objected to the recommended rulings.2\n\nThe district court nonetheless adopted them in toto and entered\n\njudgment for State Farm.          This appeal followed.\n\n              In adjudicating this dispute, Magistrate Judge Cohen\n\nwrote     a   thoughtful,    meticulously        reasoned   rescript,    dated\n\nFebruary 24, 2000, in which he concluded that the OOV exclusion\n\nwas   valid    and    foreclosed    the    appellant's      claims.     Having\n\nentertained oral argument, perused the record, and carefully\n\nconsidered the parties' briefs, we find no principled basis for\n\ndisagreement.        To the contrary, we regard this as a near-perfect\n\nsituation      in    which   to    put    into     practice    our    previous\n\npronouncement that \"when a lower court produces a comprehensive,\n\nwell-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from\n\nwriting at length to no other end than to hear its own words\n\nresonate.\"      Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 101 F.3d 218,\n\n220 (1st Cir. 1996); accord Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas, 74\n\nF.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); In re San Juan Dupont Plaza Hotel\n\nFire Litig., 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).               Consequently, we\n\n\n\n\n      2\n     The magistrate judge had the authority to decide the motion\nto amend outright.   See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) (empowering\nmagistrate judges to rule on non-dispositive motions); Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 72(a) (same).     Here, however, the magistrate chose\nmerely to make a recommendation to the district court.        We\ndescry no error and, in all events, neither party has complained\nabout this procedure.\n\n                                     -4-\n\faffirm the judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated in\n\nthe decision below.             We add only six brief comments.\n\n              First:      The OOV exclusion that appears in the two State\n\nFarm policies is nose-on-the-face plain.                  Since the motorcycle\n\nwhich the decedent was driving at the time of the accident was\n\nowned    by    him       but    insured   under   a   separate   policy,     this\n\nexclusion, by its terms, avoids coverage for the appellant's\n\nclaims.\n\n              Second:          We reject the appellant's      argument that a\n\nstate statute, 24-A M.R.S.A. § 2902-D, renders the OOV exclusion\n\nvoid.     That statute provides:\n\n                     An insurer may not sell or renew a\n              motor vehicle liability insurance policy on\n              or after January 1, 1994 with a provision\n              that excludes coverage for injury to the\n              insured or any family member of the insured.\n\n24-A M.R.S.A. § 2902-D.              The statute's reference to liability\n\ninsurance is not a mere fortuity.                 Maine's highest court has\n\nauthoritatively interpreted the statute, albeit in an earlier\n\niteration, to apply only to third-party liability coverages.\n\nCash v.    Green Mountain Ins. Co., 644 A.2d 456, 457-58 (Me.\n\n1994).        In    so    holding,    Cash   explicitly    rejected    the   same\n\nargument that the appellant advances here.                   Id. at 457.       To\n\ncinch matters, Cash is merely one in a long line of Maine cases\n\nthat    have       upheld      substantially    similar   exclusions    to     UM\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fcoverage.    E.g., Daigle v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., 573 A.2d 791,\n\n792 (Me. 1990); Bear v. United States Fid. & Guar. Co., 519 A.2d\n\n180, 182 (Me. 1986); Gross v. Green Mountain Ins. Co., 506 A.2d\n\n1139, 1142 (Me. 1986); Brackett v. Middlesex Ins. Co., 486 A.2d\n\n1188, 1191 (Me. 1985); Hare v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 471\n\nA.2d 1041, 1043 (Me. 1984).\n\n            Third:     The    appellant's   effort   to    undermine     Cash\n\nbecause that case dealt with an earlier version of the Maine\n\nstatute is unavailing.        We have carefully examined the statutory\n\namendment, effected in 1993, and find it to be inconsequential\n\nfor present purposes.         The recodification of the statute, in\n\nitself, proves nothing.        Moreover, the only substantive import\n\nof   the   amendment   relates     to   interspousal      immunity.      The\n\namendment does not in any way implicate UM coverages.            Thus, the\n\ndistinction that the appellant suggests is a distinction that\n\nmakes no difference.\n\n            Fourth:     The    appellant    asks   that   we   certify    the\n\ncoverage question to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.                    Our\n\npractice, however, has been to refrain from certification of\n\nstate-law issues when we can discern without difficulty the\n\ncourse that the state's highest court likely would follow.\n\nPorter v. Nutter, 913 F.2d 37, 41 n.4 (1st Cir. 1990).                 Given\n\nthe telling precedent of Cash, we think that certification of\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fthe coverage question that the appellant seeks to raise would be\n\nan empty exercise.\n\n            Fifth:    The   appellant's      attempt    to   fashion    a   new\n\nargument for invalidation of the OOV exclusion based on the\n\npublic policy of Maine, as expressed in the state's wrongful\n\ndeath statute, 18-A M.R.S.A. § 2-804, is procedurally defaulted.\n\nThe law is clear that when a dispositive motion is heard before\n\na magistrate judge, the movant must make all her arguments then\n\nand there, and cannot later add new arguments at subsequent\n\nstages of the proceeding.         Maine Green Party v. Maine Sec'y of\n\nState, 173 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1999) (refusing to review, as\n\nunpreserved,    an   argument     not     seasonably    presented      to   the\n\nmagistrate judge);     Paterson-Leitch Co. v.           Massachusetts Mun.\n\nWholesale    Elec.   Co.,   840    F.2d    985,   991    (1st   Cir.    1988)\n\n(similar).     Because the appellant did not make this argument to\n\nthe magistrate judge, she cannot make it here.3\n\n            Sixth:   The appellant's challenge to the denial of her\n\nmotion for leave to amend is meritless.                For one thing, the\n\nproposed amendment fails to allege any \"special relationship\"\n\nbetween the insurance agent and State Farm — and such a special\n\n\n    3 In all events, we find the argument unpersuasive on the\nmerits.\n\n                                    -7-\n\frelationship is a necessary concomitant of respondeat superior\n\nliability in insurance cases under Maine law.                 Szelenyi v.\n\nMorse, Payson & Noyes Ins., 594 A.2d 1092, 1095 (Me. 1991); Ghiz\n\nv. Richard S. Bradford, Inc., 573 A.2d 379, 380-81 (Me. 1990).\n\nFor   that    reason,   we   concur    with    Magistrate   Judge   Cohen's\n\ncharacterization of the proposed amendment as futile.                   See\n\ngenerally Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir.\n\n1988) (discussing pleader's burden to allege \"each material\n\nelement necessary to sustain recovery\").\n\n             For another thing, not only had the time for amendments\n\nstipulated in the district court's scheduling order expired by\n\nthe time that the appellant filed her motion, but State Farm's\n\nmotion for brevis disposition already was pending.            Under these\n\ncircumstances, the appellant's motion for leave to amend was\n\nuntimely.     E.g., RTC v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n             We need go no further.           For the reasons stated, we\n\naffirm the judgment below.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f",

The statute's reference to liability  insurance is not a mere fortuity.

Our  practice, however, has been to refrain from certification of  state-law issues when we can discern without difficulty the  course that the state's highest court likely would follow. Porter v. Nutter, 913 F.2d 37, 41 n.4 (1st Cir. 1990).  Given  the telling precedent of Cash, we think that certification of  the coverage question that the appellant seeks to raise would be  an empty exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth:  The appellant's attempt to fashion a new  argument for invalidation of the OOV exclusion based on the  public policy of Maine, as expressed in the state's wrongful  death statute, 18-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 2-804, is procedurally defaulted. The law is clear that when a dispositive motion is heard before  a magistrate judge, the movant must make all her arguments then  and there, and cannot later add new arguments at subsequent  stages of the proceeding.  Maine Green Party v. Maine Sec'y of  State, 173 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 1999) (refusing to review, as  unpreserved, an argument not seasonably presented to the  magistrate judge); Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Massachusetts Mun.  Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 991 (1st Cir. 1988)  (similar).  Because the appellant did not make this argument to  the magistrate judge, she cannot make it here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixth:  The appellant's challenge to the denial of her  motion for leave to amend is meritless.  For one thing, the  proposed amendment fails to allege any \"special relationship\"  between the insurance agent and State Farm -- and such a special  relationship is a necessary concomitant of respondeat superior liability in insurance cases under Maine law.  Szelenyi v. Morse, Payson &amp; Noyes Ins., 594 A.2d 1092, 1095 (Me. 1991); Ghiz v. Richard S. Bradford, Inc., 573 A.2d 379, 380-81 (Me. 1990). For that reason, we concur with Magistrate Judge Cohen's  characterization of the proposed amendment as futile.  Seegenerally Gooley v. Mobil Oil Corp., 851 F.2d 513, 515 (1st Cir.  1988) (discussing pleader's burden to allege \"each material  element necessary to sustain recovery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, not only had the time for amendments  stipulated in the district court's scheduling order expired by  the time that the appellant filed her motion, but State Farm's  motion for brevis disposition already was pending.  Under these  circumstances, the appellant's motion for leave to amend was  untimely.  E.g., RTC v. Gold, 30 F.3d 251, 253 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.

Maurice collided with an automobile operated by Bonnie Pike. Maurice was killed.  After securing an appointment as the  personal representative of his estate, his widow, plaintiff-appellant Tina L. Maurice, asserted a variety of claims arising  out of her husband's death.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pike had only modest insurance.  Her carrier paid the  appellant its policy limit:  $50,000.  The appellant then turned  to defendant-appellee State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance  Company (State Farm).  At the time of the accident, the Maurices  owned three vehicles (including the motorcycle).  Each was  covered by a separate State Farm policy.  The appellant tried to  \"stack\" the policies, demanding payment of the policy limits for  uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM) coverage under all three  polices.  As regards the non-motorcycle policies, State Farm  refused, citing the so-called other owned vehicle exclusion (the  OOV exclusion) that appeared in each of those policies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  That  exclusion reads:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>THERE IS NO COVERAGE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">*   *  *</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2.

WHILE OCCUPYING A MOTOR  VEHICLE OWNED BY YOU, YOUR  SPOUSE OR ANY RELATIVE IF IT  IS NOT INSURED FOR THIS  COVERAGE UNDER THIS POLICY . .  . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undaunted by the plain language of the OOV exclusion,  the appellant sued.  Acting on her own behalf and on behalf of  her late husband's estate, she brought an action for damages  against State Farm in a Maine court.  She cited State Farm's  refusal to pay under the UM coverages and alleged, inter alia,  breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair  dealing.  State Farm removed the action to the United States  District Court for the District of Maine.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167;  1332(a), 1441.  In due course, it moved for dismissal.  Fed. R.  Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  In an unpublished memorandum, Magistrate  Judge Cohen recommended granting the motion.  At the same time,  he recommended denying the appellant's motion for leave to file  an amended complaint (the ostensible purpose of which was to add  a count for respondeat superior liability based on certain  actions of the insurance agent who had handled the Maurices'  account).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant objected to the recommended rulings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The district court nonetheless adopted them in toto and entered  judgment for State Farm.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In adjudicating this dispute, Magistrate Judge Cohen  wrote a thoughtful, meticulously reasoned rescript, dated  February 24, 2000, in which he concluded that the OOV exclusion  was valid and foreclosed the appellant's claims.  Having  entertained oral argument, perused the record, and carefully  considered the parties' briefs, we find no principled basis for  disagreement.  To the contrary, we regard this as a near-perfect  situation in which to put into practice our previous  pronouncement that \"when a lower court produces a comprehensive,  well-reasoned decision, an appellate court should refrain from  writing at length to no other end than to hear its own words  resonate.\"  Lawton v.

Consequently, we  affirm the judgment for substantially the reasons elucidated in  the decision below.  We add only six brief comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First:  The OOV exclusion that appears in the two State  Farm policies is nose-on-the-face plain.  Since the motorcycle  which the decedent was driving at the time of the accident was  owned by him but insured under a separate policy, this  exclusion, by its terms, avoids coverage for the appellant's  claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second:  We reject the appellant's  argument that a  state statute, 24-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 2902-D, renders the OOV exclusion  void.  That statute provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An insurer may not sell or renew a  motor vehicle liability insurance policy on  or after January 1, 1994 with a provision  that excludes coverage for injury to the  insured or any family member of the insured.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">24-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 2902-D.  The statute's reference to liability  insurance is not a mere fortuity.  Maine's highest court has  authoritatively interpreted the statute, albeit in an earlier  iteration, to apply only to third-party liability coverages. Cash v. Green Mountain Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></span>, 457-58 (Me.  1994).  In so holding, Cash explicitly rejected the same  argument that the appellant advances here.  Id. at 457.  To  cinch matters, Cash is merely one in a long line of Maine cases  that have upheld substantially similar exclusions to  UM  coverage.  E.g., Daigle v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></span>,  792 (Me. 1990); Bear v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">180</span></span>, 182 (Me. 1986); Gross v. Green Mountain Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1139</span></span>, 1142 (Me. 1986); Brackett v. Middlesex Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1188</span></span>, 1191 (Me. 1985); Hare v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1041</span></span>, 1043 (Me. 1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third:  The appellant's effort to undermine Cash because that case dealt with an earlier version of the Maine  statute is unavailing.  We have carefully examined the statutory  amendment, effected in 1993, and find it to be inconsequential  for present purposes.  The recodification of the statute, in  itself, proves nothing.  Moreover, the only substantive import  of the amendment relates to interspousal immunity.  The  amendment does not in any way implicate UM coverages.  Thus, the  distinction that the appellant suggests is a distinction that  makes no difference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth:  The appellant asks that we certify the  coverage question to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court.  Our  practice, however, has been to refrain from certification of  state-law issues when we can discern without difficulty the  course that the state's highest court likely would follow. Porter v. Nutter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547470\"><a href=\"/opinion/547470/john-s-porter-v-harold-nutter/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 41 n.4 (1st Cir. 1990).  Given  the telling precedent of Cash, we think that certification of  the coverage question that the appellant seeks to raise would be  an empty exercise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth:  The appellant's attempt to fashion a new  argument for invalidation of the OOV exclusion based on the  public policy of Maine, as expressed in the state's wrongful  death statute, 18-A M.R.S.A. &#167; 2-804, is procedurally defaulted. The law is clear that when a dispositive motion is heard before  a magistrate judge, the movant must make all her arguments then  and there, and cannot later add new arguments at subsequent  stages of the proceeding.
