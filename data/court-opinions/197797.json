An exception from total liability is provided\r\n\nto employers under   8(f) of the LHWCA when the employer  proves,\r\n\namong other things,  that a permanent partial  disability existed\r\n\nprior  to the work-related  injury.   33 U.S.C.A.    908(f).   In\r\n\nconstruing this exception,  this court, along with  other circuit\r\n\ncourts of appeals, has required the employer to come forward with\r\n\nproof,  which is  not specifically  elucidated  in the  statutory\r\n\nlanguage, that the  pre-existing disability was \"manifest  to the\r\n\nemployer\" before   8(f) relief can obtain.  See Part II, infra.  \r                                                                        \r\n\n          In 1984  the LHWCA was  amended, inter alia,  to permit\r\n\nclaimants to receive compensation when a long-latent occupational\r\n\ndisease does  not become  apparent until after  the employee  has\r\n\nretired.  This appeal  presents a novel  question in the wake  of\r\n\nthat amendment:  may an employer  obtain   8(f) relief  when both\r\n\nthe claimed pre-existing  disability and compensable occupational\r\n\ndisease do not become manifest until after the worker has retired\r\n\nfrom  employment  with   the  responsible  employer?     In  such\r\n\ninstances, of  course,  the employer  cannot show  that the  pre-\r\n\nexisting  disability  was  \"manifest  to  the  employer\"  because\r\n\nemployment has ceased by the time both disabilities arise.\r\n\n          Because the  question before  us is  purely legal,  the\r\n\nfacts  underlying  the  worker's  claim  need  only  be  sketched\r\n\n                               -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nbriefly.   Phillip  J. Reno  voluntarily retired  from Bath  Iron\r\n\nWorks (\"BIW\")1 in  1985, after a total of  thirty-eight years2 in\r\n\nvarious  positions.  It is  uncontroverted that at various stages\r\n\nof his employment at BIW, Reno was exposed to asbestos.   In 1989\r\n\nor  1990,  several  years after  his  retirement,  Reno  began to\r\n\nexperience shortness  of breath.   He was diagnosed at  that time\r\n\nwith  chronic  obstructive   pulmonary  disease  (emphysema)  and\r\n\ninterstitial lung disease.  Reno had been a cigarette smoker.  In\r\n\nJune of  1991, Reno  was referred to  a pulmonary  specialist who\r\n\ndiagnosed obstructive pulmonary disease,  primarily the result of\r\n\ncigarette smoking,  and restrictive  pulmonary disease  resulting\r\n\nfrom Reno's  asbestos  exposure.   Reno  was  assessed  a  twenty\r\n\npercent  whole person  impairment due  to  the overall  pulmonary\r\n\nimpairments.  Reno filed a timely claim for workers' compensation\r\n\nbenefits on the basis of his partial pulmonary disability.\r\n\n          BIW in  turn gave notice  of its intent to  seek relief\r\n\nfrom the compensation liability under   8(f) of the LHWCA on  the\r\n\ntheory  that  Reno's smoking-related  emphysema  was  a permanent\r\n\npartial disability  which  predated the  work-related  injury  of\r\n\nasbestosis.   On December 3,  1993, the Administrative  Law Judge\r\n\n(\"ALJ\")  awarded benefits  to  Reno  and denied  BIW  the    8(f)\r\n\nrelief.  Relying on our precedent, the ALJ held that in  order to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1.   We  refer to  Petitioners BIW  and Liberty  Mutual Insurance\r\nCompany collectively as BIW.\r\n\n2.  We feel compelled to note that, contrary to BIW's description\r\nof  Reno's work  history,  thirty-eight  years  is  not  properly\r\ncharacterized  as \"employ[ment]  for  several  years.\"    Br.  of\r                                                       \r\nPetitioner at 2 (emphasis added).\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nobtain such  relief, an employer  must demonstrate that  the pre-\r\n\nexisting  disability  was  manifest  to  the  employer  prior  to\r\n\nretirement.  \r\n\n          BIW appealed the legal basis  of the   8(f) decision to\r\n\nthe  Department  of  Labor's Benefits  Review  Board.    After no\r\n\naction, the ALJ's decision became the final order of the Board on\r\n\nSeptember 12,  1996.   See Omnibus  Consolidated Rescissions  and\r                                                                           \r\n\nAppropriations Act  of 1996,  Pub. L.

Because the  issue before us\r\n\nis purely a question of law, we exercise de novo review.  Liberty\r                                                                           \r\n\nMut.  Ins.

Based on\r\n\nthis postulate, BIW points to both the plain language of    8(f),\r\n\nand the substance and legislative history of the 1984  Amendments\r\n\nto argue  that it is entitled to relief under   8(f).  In Newport\r                                                                           \r\n\nNews Shipbuilding  &amp; Dry Dock  Co. v.

The\r\n\nfirst sentence of  the section contains  the language crucial  to\r\n\nall  requests for relief:    8(f)  cases are  those \"in  which an\r\n\nemployee having an existing permanent partial disability  suffers\r                                                                  \r\n\ninjury.\"\r\n\n          The  statute,  however,  is silent  on  the  meaning of\r\n\n\"existing permanent partial disability.\"   See 33 U.S.C.A.    902\r                                                        \r\n\n(definitions).  At  first blush then,  BIW's argument makes  some\r\n\nsense;  it is,  at least,  an  arguable reading  to suggest  that\r\n\nReno's  emphysema was an  \"existing permanent partial disability\"\r\n\n                               -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nby the  time the asbestosis made itself known.  Leaving aside the\r\n\nquestion  of when  injury  occurs  for  purposes  of  long-latent\r\n\noccupational diseases,4 the issue turns  to a large degree on how\r\n\none interprets the word \"existing.\"  For purposes of this appeal,\r\n\ndoes  it  mean  existing during  employment,  or  existing before\r\n\nanother   disability   becomes  apparent?      The  manifestation\r\n\nrequirement,  to which  we now  turn,  was in  large measure  the\r\n\nresult of  courts' determinations  on the  meaning of  \"existing\"\r\n\ndisability.\r\n\n                               II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          The font of the manifestation requirement can be traced\r\n\nto the  Supreme Court's opinion in Lawson v. Suwanee Fruit &amp; S.S.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCo.,  336  U.S. 198  (1949).    There,  the  Court was  asked  to\r             \r\n\ndetermine the proper meaning of  \"disability\" in the context of  \r\n\n8(f)'s  coverage  for  \"previous disabilit[ies].\"    Id.  at 200.\r                                                                  \r\n\nBecause   the  definitional   portion   of   the  LHWCA   defined\r\n\n\"disability\" in relation to an injury \"arising out of and in  the\r\n\ncourse  of  employment,\" id.  (quoting  LHWCA    2(2)),  a thorny\r                                      \r\n\nquestion of statutory interpretation emerged: must  the \"previous\r\n\ndisability\"  also  arise  out  of  an  employment-related injury?\r\n\nAfter a review  of the Act's legislative history,  id. at 201-04,\r                                                                \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n4.   Our inquiry  would be simplified  if the  statutory language\r\nexplicitly defined  the time of  injury in such cases.   Instead,\r\nthe definition of \"injury\" includes \"such occupational disease or\r\ninfection  as  arises  naturally  out  of  such  employment,\"  33\r\nU.S.C.A.   902(2), and as we examine infra, wage calculations for\r                                                    \r\noccupational disease reference  the onset of disabling  effect as\r\nthe time of \"injury,\" 33 U.S.C.A.   910(i).

As one example  of the flavor of the debate,\r\n\nit was  stated that  compensation systems  without second  injury\r\n\nprovisions, \"would become  an instrument of persecution .  . . of\r\n\nmen  who  are  physically  handicapped.\"    Id. at  203  (quoting\r                                                         \r\n\ntestimony  of Joseph  Parks of Massachusetts  Industrial Accident\r\n\nCommission, United States  Bureau of Labor Statistics,  Bull.

The legislative history of\r\n\nthe  Act demonstrates that  Congress responded to  the unintended\r\n\neffect of non-apportionment  by including a \"second  injury fund\"\r\n\nin  the statute.    See Johnson,  129 F.3d  at  50 (stating  that\r                                         \r\n\nconclusion); Ceres Marine, 118 F.3d at 389 (same).   Although the\r                                   \r\n\nlegislative history of  the original Act is  not voluminous, what\r\n\n                               -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\ndoes exist  drives our conclusion that   8(f) was included in the\r\n\nLHWCA   specifically   to   ameliorate  the   effects   of   non-\r\n\napportionment.  Discriminatory  effect  was  certainly  seriously\r\n\nconsidered.

Mr.  E.  M. Braxton  of  the  Newport  News\r\n\nShipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock  Company reiterated his concern  that the\r\n\nAct would require employers to \"examine every man who applies for\r\n\nwork; and the  poor dog that is suffering  from some disease will\r\n\nbe turned away from our  plant because . . . as a  matter of life\r\n\nand death financially we will  have to turn him down.\"   Hearings\r                                                                           \r\n\non  S.3170 Before  the  House Committee  on  the Judiciary,  69th\r                                                                    \r\n\nCong., 1st Sess. at 196 (1926).   In rebuttal, a witness in favor\r\n\nof the legislation testified as follows:\r\n\n          The second  injury proposition is as  much to\r\n          the  advantage   of  the  employer   and  his\r\n          interests as  it is  for the  benefit of  the\r\n          employee.   It protects that employer who has\r\n          hired, say, a  one-eyed worker  who goes  and\r\n          loses  his other  eye  and  becomes  a  total\r\n          disability.   The employer without  this sort\r\n          of thing  would have  to pay  total permanent\r\n\n                               -16-\r                                          16\r\r\n\n          disability compensation.   Then, on the other\r\n          hand, this also protects the worker  with one\r\n          eye from  being denied employment  on account\r\n          of  his being an  extra risk.   Now by simply\r\n          taking this up  in this way it is possible to\r\n          protect  both the employer and to protect the\r\n          one-eyed employee  also.   It is  one of  the\r\n          best  social  inventions  in  legislation  of\r\n          which I have knowledge.\r\n\nId. at 208 (testimony of Mr. Andrews).

Because  the legislative  history of  the original  Act\r\n\ndemonstrates that   8(f) was specifically designed to  reduce the\r\n\nincentive for discrimination,  it makes logical sense  that \"only\r\n\npotential discriminators [are] eligible for Section 8(f) relief.\"\r\n\nLockhart, 980 F.2d at 82.\r                  \r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r\n\n          In 1972, the LHWCA was amended,9 see Longshoreman's and\r                                                        \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n9.   There were, of course, other amendments  to the Act prior to\r\n1972.   According to  one Report  generated as  part of the  1984\r\nAmendments,\r\n            [O]ther  employee  groups   were  [eventually]\r\n       covered  under the Act.   The District  of Columbia\r\n       Workmen's Compensation Act (1928) extended coverage\r\n       to  employees of  private employers  in Washington,\r\n       D.C.  The Defense Base Act (1941) extended coverage\r\n       to  employees of  federal  contractors at  military\r\n       bases or on public works contracts performed in any\r\n       place  outside the continental  United States.  The\r\n       Nonappropriated Fund  Instrumentalities Act  (1952)\r\n       applied   the  LHWCA   to  civilian   employees  of\r\n       nonappropriated fund instrumentalities of the Armed\r\n       Forces  (such as  post exchanges).    In 1953,  the\r\n       Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act extended coverage\r\n       to employees  on the  U.S. Outer Continental  Shelf\r\n       involved in  exploring for  and developing  natural\r\n       resources.\r\n\n                               -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\nHarbor Workers' Compensation Act Amendments  of 1972, Pub.

Rep. No. 92-1125, at  1 (1972).  As\r\n\npart of the 1972  Amendments, the language of   8(f) was changed,\r\n\nsubstituting  the  language  of  \"previous  disability\"  for  the\r\n\ncurrent  language of \"existing permanent partial disability.\"  86\r\n\nStat. at 1257.

Thus,  the Harris court deduced that an expansion of\r                                        \r\n\nan  individual's right  to file  a claim  should be  coupled with\r\n\ncorresponding relief  for the employer.   934 F.2d  at 552.   But\r\n\nreview  of  the   entirety  of  that  House   Report,  and  other\r\n\nlegislative documents,  demonstrates  that  the  quoted  language\r\n\ncannot support the weight ascribed to it.\r\n\n          First, there  is compelling evidence  that Congress was\r\n\nwell  aware   of,  and  in  fact  endorsed,  application  of  the\r\n\nmanifestation  requirement  to    8(f)  cases.   A  Senate Report\r\n\nstates  that \"[a]n employer able to demonstraate [sic] actual or,\r                                                                       \r\n\nin some cases, constructive knowledge  that an injured worker had\r                                               \r\n\na  permanent disability which  pre-dated a compensable  injury is\r\n\noften able  to shift to  the Special Fund the  responsibility for\r\n\npaying a very  substantial portion of the amounts  payable to the\r\n\nworker.\"  S.  Rep. No. 97-498, at 35  (1982)(emphases added); see\r                                                                           \r\n\nalso  S. Rep.  No.  98-81, at  34  (1983)(same).   We think  this\r              \r\n\nlanguage is  most reasonably read  as referring to the  manner in\r\n\nwhich courts of appeals had analyzed disputes concerning   8(f) -\r\n\n- by requiring a showing of actual or constructive knowledge with\r\n\nevidence of  \"manifestation.\"   Similarly, the  House and  Senate\r\n\n                               -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nReports on  the 1984  bill expressly  recognized that  \"[s]ection\r\n\n8(f) of the  Act was designed to encourage employers  to hire and\r\n\nretain  disabled workers by  distributing much of  the additional\r\n\ncost of industrial injury attributable  to pre-existing permanent\r\n\ndisabilities  among all  employers and  carriers  subject to  the\r\n\nAct.\"  S. Rep.  No. 97-498, at  34-35; S. Rep.  No. 98-81, at  34\r\n\n(same  language).  Thus  \"[t]he goals of  Section 8(f) remain[ed]\r\n\nvalid,\" S.Rep.97-498, at35, aspartand parcelofthe 1984Amendments.\r\n\n          Ultimately  fatal   to  BIW's   position  is   evidence\r\n\nconcerning  how Congress  conceptualized  its amendment  allowing\r\n\nclaims  for  long-latent  occupational  diseases.   Consider  the\r\n\nfollowing language from the House Report:\r\n\n          The first  change to the  body which  results\r\n          from exposure to a  harmful physical agent or\r\n          a  toxic substance  often  is not  disabling.\r\n          Since  it  is  the  disability  which  should\r\n          trigger the compensation claim, the Committee\r\n          notes that unlike  traumatic occurrences, the\r                                                                 \r\n          period of  time between the 'injury'  and the\r                                                                 \r\n          arising  of a  compensation  claim in  such a\r                                                      \r\n          long-latency occupational disease case may be\r\n          so long as  to make the requirement  that the\r\n          employee  file  a  Notice  of  Injury  within\r\n          thirty days  of the 'injury' nonsensical. . .\r\n          .\r\n\n            To the same effect, triggering the  statute\r\n          of limitations for the filing of compensation\r\n          claims on the  date of 'injury'  makes little\r\n          sense  in  the  context  of  an  occupational\r                                                                 \r\n          disease in  which the disabling  condition or\r                                                                 \r\n          the death does not follow immediately  on the\r                                                                 \r\n          \"injury.\"\r                            \r\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 98-570, at 10-11 (emphases added).  \r\n\n          What  is  important  here  is  that  in  crafting  this\r\n\nparticular  amendment concerning  occupational disease,  Congress\r\n\n                               -21-\r                                          21\r\r\n\nconceptualized the \"injury\" as occurring  at the time of exposure\r\n\nto the  causative agent, which  would necessarily  have to  occur\r\n\nduring  employment.   At  the  very least,  this  Report language\r\n\nprecludes   the   argument  that   Congress   was   removing  the\r\n\nmanifestation  requirement  in  instances  involving  these   new\r\n\noccupational  disease claims.  Because the \"injury\" was conceived\r\n\nas occurring  during  employment,    8(f)  retained  its  regular\r\n\nmeaning   --  applying  when  \"an  employee  having  an  existing\r\n\npermanent  partial  disability  suffers injury.\"  33  U.S.C.A.   \r\n\n8(f)(1). \r\n\n          This  Report  language  is  affirmed   by  the  amended\r\n\nstatutory language itself; and we  must read statutes as a whole,\r\n\nrather than focus  on isolated phrases.  Conroy  v. Aniskoff, 507\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  511, 515  (1993).    As part  of  the occupational  disease\r\n\namendment, there also had to be a determination made as to how to\r\n\ncalculate the amount of compensation paid in such cases.  Because\r\n\nthe  existing   formula  generally  calculated   compensation  in\r\n\nreference  to \"the average weekly  wage . . .  at the time of the\r\n\ninjury,\" 33  U.S.C.A.    910, there was  concern that  very long-\r\n\nlatent  diseases would  leave  disabled  retirees  in  an  unfair\r\n\neconomic situation because  wages increased over time,  H.R. Rep.\r\n\nNo. 98-570,  at 11-12.   It was  therefore decided  that in  such\r\n\ninstances, \"the time  of injury shall be deemed to be the date on\r                                                         \r\n\nwhich  the  employee  becomes aware,  or  . . . should  have been\r\n\naware, of the  relationship between the employment,  the disease,\r\n\nand the death or disability.\"   98 Stat. at 1647-48 (codified  at\r\n\n                               -22-\r                                          22\r\r\n\n33 U.S.C.A.   910(i))(emphasis added).  Thus, by establishing the\r\n\ntime of  injury at a  time closer to  the onset of  the disabling\r\n\nsymptoms for  purposes of  wage calculation,  Congress implicitly\r\n\nrecognized  that the injury-in-fact to the physical body occurred\r\n\nduring  the occupational exposure,  but did not  become disabling\r\n\nuntil later.   Although the 1984  Amendments were most  certainly\r\n\ndesigned  in part  to \"reduce  the  cost of  . .  .  coverage for\r\n\nemployers in  the covered industries,\"   H.R. Rep. 98-570,  at 3,\r\n\nquoted in Harris, 934 F.2d at 552,  they did so in a multitude of\r                          \r\n\nways.10  Providing   8(f) relief to employers under facts such as\r\n\nthese was simply not one of them. \r\n\n          We point out additional authority for our ruling.  Just\r\n\nafter  the 1984 Amendments,  the Department of  Labor amended the\r\n\nregulations  interpreting the  LHWCA to  include,  for the  first\r\n\ntime, the manifestation  requirement.  50  Fed. Reg. 401  (1985),\r\n\namended, 51  Fed.  Reg.  4285  (1986)(codified  at  20  C.F.R.   \r\n\n702.321(a) (1)(1997)).   Thus, if  we found that  the legislative\r\n\nhistory provided guidance less clear  than it does, we would have\r\n\nlittle  trouble  deferring  to the  Department's  interpretation,\r\n\ngiven our finding -- in Part III, supra -- that the manifestation\r                                                 \r\n\nrequirement  \"is based  on  a  permissible  construction  of  the\r\n\nstatute.\"    Chevron  U.S.A. Inc.  v.  Natural  Resources Defense\r                                                                           \r\n\nCouncil, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984).\r                       \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10.   For example, the  definition of \"employee\" was  modified to\r\nexclude  clerical workers and others  whose \"work does not expose\r\nthem to traditional maritime hazards.\"   H.R. Rep. No. 98-570, at\r\n3; see 98 Stat. at 1639.  \r                \r\n\n                               -23-\r                                          23\r\r\n\n          The argument has also been made that, in instances such\r\n\nas  these, the manifestation requirement serves no useful purpose\r\n\nbecause  there is  no  potential  for  discrimination  where  the\r\n\nemployee  has  already  retired.     It  is  not,  however,   the\r\n\nmanifestation   requirement  that   has  an   anti-discrimination\r\n\npurpose, but   8(f) which has such a purpose.  The requirement is\r\n\nonly  a  judicially created  tool,  developed  in  order to  help\r\n\ndetermine when  the purpose of    8(f) is  being served.   As our\r\n\nanalysis demonstrates,    8(f) was designed  for a very  specific\r\n\nreason  --  to  remove the  discriminatory  incentive  created by\r\n\nholding   the  last  employer  liable  for   the  results  of  an\r\n\naggravating  injury.  The  manifestation requirement ensures that\r\n\nrequests for    8(f) relief  remain within the intended  scope of\r\n\nthe Section.   The requirement  is not an additional  hurdle, but\r\n\nrather an  integral part  of    8(f).   We are  therefore not  at\r\n\nliberty to either  apply or discard the requirement  as different\r\n\nfacts are presented,  especially in the absence  of congressional\r\n\ndirective.  \r\n\n          We do not think it  is either unreasonable or unfair to\r\n\npreclude access  by the  employer to the  Special Fund  under the\r\n\nfacts of this  case.   There can  be little doubt  that Reno  was\r\n\nexposed to asbestos during his working career at BIW, and BIW has\r\n\nnot  contested  that  Reno's  exposure  to  asbestos  during  his\r\n\nemployment  at  BIW caused  his asbestosis.   They  are therefore\r\n\nproperly  liable for  the results  of  this work-related  injury.\r\n\n                               -24-\r                                          24\r\r\n\nBecause they have not met their burden of establishing a right to\r\n\n  8(f) relief, the decision of the Board is affirmed.  \r                                                      affirmed.\r                                                               \r\n\n                               -25-\r                                          25\r\r\n",

An exception from total liability is provided to employers under &#167; 8(f) of the LHWCA when the employer proves, among other things, that a permanent partial disability existed prior to the work-related injury.  33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 908(f).  In construing this exception, this court, along with other circuit courts of appeals, has required the employer to come forward with proof, which is not specifically elucidated in the statutory language, that the pre-existing disability was \"manifest to the employer\" before &#167; 8(f) relief can obtain.  See Part II, infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984 the LHWCA was amended, inter alia, to permit claimants to receive compensation when a long-latent occupational disease does not become apparent until after the employee has retired.  This appeal presents a novel question in the wake of that amendment:  may an employer obtain &#167; 8(f) relief when both the claimed pre-existing disability and compensable occupational disease do not become manifest until after the worker has retired from employment with the responsible employer?   In such instances, of course, the employer cannot show that the pre-existing disability was \"manifest to the employer\" because employment has ceased by the time both disabilities arise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the question before us is purely legal, the facts underlying the worker's claim need only be sketched briefly.  Phillip J. Reno voluntarily retired from Bath Iron Works (\"BIW\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in 1985, after a total of thirty-eight years<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in various positions.  It is uncontroverted that at various stages of his employment at BIW, Reno was exposed to asbestos.  In 1989 or 1990, several years after his retirement, Reno began to experience shortness of breath.  He was diagnosed at that time with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema) and interstitial lung disease.  Reno had been a cigarette smoker.  In June of 1991, Reno was referred to a pulmonary specialist who diagnosed obstructive pulmonary disease, primarily the result of cigarette smoking, and restrictive pulmonary disease resulting from Reno's asbestos exposure.  Reno was assessed a twenty percent whole person impairment due to the overall pulmonary impairments.  Reno filed a timely claim for workers' compensation benefits on the basis of his partial pulmonary disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW in turn gave notice of its intent to seek relief from the compensation liability under &#167; 8(f) of the LHWCA on the theory that Reno's smoking-related emphysema was a permanent partial disability which predated the work-related injury of asbestosis.  On December 3, 1993, the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") awarded benefits to Reno and denied BIW the &#167; 8(f) relief.  Relying on our precedent, the ALJ held that in order to obtain such relief, an employer must demonstrate that the pre-existing disability was manifest to the employer prior to retirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW appealed the legal basis of the &#167; 8(f) decision to the Department of Labor's Benefits Review Board.  After no action, the ALJ's decision became the final order of the Board on September 12, 1996.  See Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. at 1321-219 (April 26, 1996).  Our jurisdiction over the appeal is proper under 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 921(c).  Because the issue before us is purely a question of law, we exercise de novo review.  Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 978 F.2d 750, 757 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW posits that Reno's emphysema is a pre-existing permanent disability which, when combined with his occupational disease of asbestosis, created a greater disability.  Based on this postulate, BIW points to both the plain language of &#167; 8(f), and the substance and legislative history of the 1984 Amendments to argue that it is entitled to relief under &#167; 8(f).  In Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Harris, 934 F.2d 548 (4th Cir.1991), the Fourth Circuit examined a similar situation, and concluded that \"adherence to the [manifestation] requirement [in instances of a long-latent occupational disease] would defeat the real purposes of the [1984] amendments,\" id. at 553.   In cases such as these, the Harris court determined that \"the manifestation requirement will not be applied.\"  Id.  BIW urges adoption of the Harris holding,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> as a basis for overturning the decision of the Board below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to follow the Fourth Circuit and therefore affirm the decision of the Board.  We find the manifestation requirement a necessary prerequisite to &#167; 8(f) relief even where the compensation claim is based on a post-retirement long-latent occupational disease.  Our analysis follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 8(f) of the Act, \"the liability for permanent partial and permanent total disability, and death benefits, [is shifted] from employer to the Special Fund when the disability or death is not due solely to the injury which is the subject of the claim.\"   A2 Benefits Review Board Service, Longshore Reporter Desk Book &#167; D8.20, at 248 (Matthew Bender, 1996).  In these instances, after an initial period of employer liability, the employee is \"paid the remainder of the compensation that would be due out of the special fund established in section 944 of\" the LHWCA.  33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 908(f)(2)(A).  The Special Fund is currently financed by assessments on all covered employers, part of which is prorated according to the extent to which that particular employer's compensated employees make use of the Fund. 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 944(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn initially to the words of the statute.  If these are not clear, \"we next examine the legislative history, albeit skeptically, in search of an unmistakable expression of congressional intent.\"  Strickland v. Commissioner, Me.  Dep't of Human Servs., 48 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 8(f) currently reads, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Injury increasing disability:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) In any case in which an employee having an existing permanent partial disability suffers injury, the employer shall provide compensation for such disability as is found to be attributable to that injury based upon the average weekly wages of the employee at the time of the injury.  If following [certain statutorily scheduled] ... injur[ies] ..., the employee is totally and permanently disabled, and the disability is found not to be due solely to that injury, the employer shall provide compensation for the applicable prescribed period of weeks provided for in that section for the subsequent injury, or for one hundred and four weeks, whichever is the greater....  In all other cases of total permanent disability or of death, found not to be due solely to that injury, of an employee having an existing permanent partial disability, the employer shall provide ... compensation payments or death benefits for one hundred and four weeks only.  If, following [a statutorily scheduled] injury ..., the employee has a permanent partial disability and the disability is found not to be due solely to that injury, and such disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer shall provide compensation for the applicable period of weeks ..., or for one hundred and four weeks, whichever is the greater....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all other cases in which the employee has a permanent partial disability, found not to be due solely to that injury, and such disability is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer shall provide in addition to [statutorily mandated compensation], compensation for one hundred and four weeks only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 908(f)(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus two categories of resulting disability are covered under &#167; 8(f):  (1) total permanent disability found to be the result of the workplace injury (statutorily scheduled or otherwise) combined with the existing disability;  and (2) partial permanent disability found to be the result of the workplace injury (statutorily scheduled or otherwise) combined with the existing disability, where the resulting disability is \"materially and substantially greater\" because of the combined effect.  Reno's situation falls under the latter category.  The first sentence of the section contains the language crucial to all requests for relief:  &#167; 8(f) cases are those \"in which an employee having an existing permanent partial disability suffers injury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute, however, is silent on the meaning of \"existing permanent partial disability.\"   See 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 902 (definitions).  At first blush then, BIW's argument makes some sense;  it is, at least, an arguable reading to suggest that Reno's emphysema was an \"existing permanent partial disability\" by the time the asbestosis made itself known.  Leaving aside the question of when injury occurs for purposes of long-latent occupational diseases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the issue turns to a large degree on how one interprets the word \"existing.\"   For purposes of this appeal, does it mean existing during employment, or existing before another disability becomes apparent?   The manifestation requirement, to which we now turn, was in large measure the result of courts' determinations on the meaning of \"existing\" disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The font of the manifestation requirement can be traced to the Supreme Court's opinion in Lawson v. Suwanee Fruit &amp; S.S. Co., 336 U.S. 198, 69 S.Ct. 503, 93 L.Ed. 611 (1949).  There, the Court was asked to determine the proper meaning of \"disability\" in the context of &#167; 8(f)'s coverage for \"previous disabilit[ies].\"  Id. at 200, 69 S.Ct. at 504.   Because the definitional portion of the LHWCA defined \"disability\" in relation to an injury \"arising out of and in the course of employment,\" id.  (quoting LHWCA &#167; 2(2)), a thorny question of statutory interpretation emerged:  must the \"previous disability\" also arise out of an employment-related injury?   After a review of the Act's legislative history, id. at 201-04, 69 S.Ct. at 504-06, the Court answered in the negative, id. at 206, 69 S.Ct. at 506-07.  \"If we read the definition [of disability] into &#167; 8(f)(1) in a mechanical fashion, we create obvious incongruities in the language, and we destroy one of the major purposes of the second injury provision:  the prevention of employer discrimination against handicapped workers.\"  Id. at 201, 69 S.Ct. at 504 (emphasis added).  It was Lawson generally, and this emphasized language in particular which the courts of appeals have seized upon in developing the manifestation requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1970, the D.C. Circuit interpreted &#167; 8(f) as it then existed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and formally extracted for the first time what has come to be known as the \"manifestation\" requirement--requiring the employer to show that the pre-existing disability was manifest to the employer before &#167; 8(f) relief can obtain.  American Mut. Ins. Co. of Boston v. Jones, 426 F.2d 1263 (D.C.Cir.1970).  Denying &#167; 8(f) relief to the employer, the court stated that \"nothing in the record gives any indication that [the claimant], up to the time of his [work-related] injuries, showed a sufficient degree of social maladaption due to limited intelligence that his disability could be fairly classed as 'manifest.' \"  Id. at 1268.   The American Mutual court's construction of &#167; 8(f) was informed by what it determined to be the primary purpose of the &#167; 8(f) exception:  \"to remove that aspect of discrimination against the disabled which would otherwise be encouraged by the very statute intended to protect them.\"  Id. at 1267.   Thus, it was reasoned, \"discrimination ... must rest upon knowledge of the characteristic upon which the discrimination is to be based.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was not long before other circuit courts of appeals adopted the same requirement.  See e.g., Dillingham Corp. v. Massey, 505 F.2d 1126, 1128 (9th Cir.1974);  Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores, Inc. v. Director, OWCP, 542 F.2d 602, 606 (3d Cir.1976);  Duluth, M. and I.R. Ry. Co. v. United States Dep't of Labor, 553 F.2d 1144, 1148-51 (8th Cir.1977).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has required the employer to meet the manifestation requirement since General Dynamics Corp. v. Sacchetti, 681 F.2d 37, 39-40 (1st Cir.1982).  We required a showing of \"manifest[ation] to the employer,\" because we observed that &#167; 8(f) \"was designed to encourage employers to hire or continue to employ handicapped workers by ensuring that the employer would not have to compensate in full for a subsequently incurred permanent disability when that disability was attributable in part to a previously existing handicap.\"  Id. We have steadfastly adhered to this requirement.  Director, OWCP v. General Dynamics Corp., 980 F.2d 74, 76 (1st Cir.1992)  (Lockhart );<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Bath Iron Works Corp. v. Director, OWCP, 950 F.2d 56, 58 (1st Cir.1991);  CNA Ins. Co. v. Legrow, 935 F.2d 430, 435 (1st Cir.1991);  White v. Bath Iron Works Corp., 812 F.2d 33, 35 (1st Cir.1987);  Director, OWCP v. General Dynamics Corp., 787 F.2d 723, 725 (1st Cir.1986)(Fantucchio ).  See also Director, OWCP v. Bath Iron Works Corp.  (Johnson ), 129 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir.1997)(reiterating nondiscrimination purpose behind &#167; 8(f)).  Our current jurisprudence therefore dictates that, in order \"[t]o prove that it is entitled to Section 8(f) relief, an employer must show that, (1) the employee had a permanent partial disability that existed prior to the second injury;  (2) the second injury contributed to that disability;  and (3) the prior disability was 'manifest' to the employer.\"  Lockhart, 980 F.2d at 76.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have noted, we turned to what has been consistently elucidated as the core purpose of &#167; 8(f)--prevention of discrimination--to inform our adoption of the manifestation requirement.  Sacchetti, 681 F.2d at 40.   Indeed, our most extensive analysis of the manifestation requirement to date reiterated that the \"crucial issue [in &#167; 8(f) relief], ... is the potential for discrimination against the disabled.\"  Lockhart, 980 F.2d at 81.   We stated that \"[t]he centrality of this issue is emphasized in all our cases interpreting the [LHWCA].\"  Id.  The challenged standard employed by the Board in Lockhart's case, which involved a question concerning the permanency of the pre-existing disability, queried whether there was \"sufficient information regarding the existence of a serious lasting problem which would motivate a cautious employer to consider terminating the employee.\"  Id. at 80.   We held the standard proper because \"[i]t effectuates the purpose of the manifest requirement and Section 8(f) by making only potential discriminators eligible for Section 8(f) relief.\"  Id. at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To date, eight other circuits besides ours apply this requirement:  the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, Eleventh and District of Columbia.  Sealand Terminals, Inc. v. Gasparic, 7 F.3d 321, 323 (2d Cir.1993)(per curiam);  Director, OWCP v. Universal Terminal &amp; Stevedoring Corp., 575 F.2d 452, 455 (3d Cir.1978);  Director, OWCP v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co.  (Langley ), 676 F.2d 110, 114 (4th Cir.1982);  Ceres Marine Terminal v. Director, OWCP, 118 F.3d 387, 392 (5th Cir.1997);  Duluth, 553 F.2d at 1149-51 (8th Cir.1977);  Director, OWCP v. Cargill, Inc., 709 F.2d 616, 618-19 (9th Cir.1983)(en banc);  C.G. Willis, Inc. v.

Only the Sixth Circuit has rejected the manifestation requirement, substituting instead the directive that the pre-existing disability be manifest to someone--not necessarily the employer--prior to the work-related injury.  American Ship Bldg. Co. v. Director, OWCP, 865 F.2d 727, 732 (6th Cir.1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say that the requirement is by now well-ensconced within the rubric of the LHWCA would be an understatement.  We must note, however, that despite the Benefits Review Board's description of the manifestation requirement as a \"well-settled concept,\" Caudill v. Sea Tac Alaska Shipbuilding, 25 BRBS 92, 99 (1991), the Supreme Court has not yet decided its validity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The manifestation requirement has been properly characterized as \"a 'judicial gloss' which Congress has not acted to erase.\"  American Ship Building, 865 F.2d at 730.   Nor could we erase it if we wanted to.  It is well settled that, \"[i]n a multi-panel circuit, newly constituted panels, generally speaking, are bound by prior panel decisions on point.\"  Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Auth., 991 F.2d 935, 939 n. 3 (1st Cir.1993).  We are, however, confronted with a situation made novel by congressional amendment, and must therefore determine whether those amendments should effectuate a change in our traditional analysis of requests for &#167; 8(f) relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we remain convinced that application of the manifestation requirement to requests for &#167; 8(f) relief is the proper way to give the Section its intended meaning.  We think the LHWCA's legislative history shows that &#167; 8(f) was designed to serve a very specific and limited purpose with regards to the operation of the compensation scheme as a whole.  Because the manifestation requirement effectuates this limited purpose, we affirm our adherence to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original LHWCA was passed in 1927 in response to a series of Supreme Court decisions that invalidated prior attempts to cover maritime workers under existing state compensation structures.  See G. Bober &amp; M. Wible, Compensable Injury or Death Arising Under the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 35 Loyola L.Rev. 1129, 1131 (1990).  \"It was held that the matter [of maritime compensation] was outside state cognizance and exclusively within federal maritime jurisdiction....\"  Calbeck v. Travelers Ins. Co., 370 U.S. 114, 117, 82 S.Ct. 1196, 1198-99, 8 L.Ed.2d 368 (1962)(discussing Southern Pac.  Co. v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205, 37 S.Ct. 524, 61 L.Ed. 1086 (1917)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Around the time the LHWCA was debated and crafted, workers' compensation schemes had become so popular that \"[b]y 1920, all but eight states had adopted Compensation Acts.\"  A.

By holding the last employer liable for the results of accumulated injury, it was argued, employers had a significant incentive to discriminate against those workers already physically disabled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  Johnson, 129 F.3d at 50.   The most commonly reiterated example of this effect derives from the Oklahoma experience.

After the decision, Mr. Huber [of Oklahoma] reports, \"thousands of one-eyed, one-legged, one-armed, one-handed men in the State of Oklahoma were let out and can not get employment coming under the workmen's compensation law of Oklahoma....

No. 536 at 268, 272 (1931))(first two alterations added).  As one example of the flavor of the debate, it was stated that compensation systems without second injury provisions, \"would become an instrument of persecution ... of men who are physically handicapped.\"  Id. at 203, 69 S.Ct. at 505 (quoting testimony of Joseph Parks of Massachusetts Industrial Accident Commission, United States Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bull.

The legislative history of the Act demonstrates that Congress responded to the unintended effect of non-apportionment by including a \"second injury fund\" in the statute.  See Johnson, 129 F.3d at 50 (stating that conclusion);  Ceres Marine, 118 F.3d at 389 (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the legislative history of the original Act is not voluminous, what does exist drives our conclusion that &#167; 8(f) was included in the LHWCA specifically to ameliorate the effects of non-apportionment.  Discriminatory effect was certainly seriously considered.  For instance, Representative Bowling stated during a colloquy on a potential apportionment scheme that even under such a system, the disabled employee was likely to remain jobless.  To Provide Compensation for Employees Injured and Dependents of Employees Killed in Certain Maritime Employments:  Hearings on H.R. 9498 Before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. at 74 (1926) (\"Well, that sounds like 'good-by' [sic] for the [disabled employee]\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perhaps the most telling exchange on point occurred during hearings over the Senate version of the bill, which would later be enacted.  Mr. E.M. Braxton of the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company reiterated his concern that the Act would require employers to \"examine every man who applies for work;  and the poor dog that is suffering from some disease will be turned away from our plant because ... as a matter of life and death financially we will have to turn him down.\"   Hearings on S.3170 Before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. at 196 (1926).  In rebuttal, a witness in favor of the legislation testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>The second injury proposition is as much to the advantage of the employer and his interests as it is for the benefit of the employee.  It protects that employer who has hired, say, a one-eyed worker who goes and loses his other eye and becomes a total disability.  The employer without this sort of thing would have to pay total permanent disability compensation.  Then, on the other hand, this also protects the worker with one eye from being denied employment on account of his being an extra risk. Now by simply taking this up in this way it is possible to protect both the employer and to protect the one-eyed employee also.  It is one of the best social inventions in legislation of which I have knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 208 (testimony of Mr. Andrews).

Because the legislative history of the original Act demonstrates that &#167; 8(f) was specifically designed to reduce the incentive for discrimination, it makes logical sense that \"only potential discriminators [are] eligible for Section 8(f) relief.\"  Lockhart, 980 F.2d at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1972, the LHWCA was amended,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> see Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. 92-576, 86 Stat. 1251 (1972), \"[t]he principle purpose of ...

As part of the 1972 Amendments, the language of &#167; 8(f) was changed, substituting the language of \"previous disability\" for the current language of \"existing permanent partial disability.\"   86 Stat. at 1257.  The Amendments also opened the door for employers to &#167; 8(f) relief where the resulting combined disability was not total, but partial.

See Duluth, 553 F.2d at 1149 (making that determination);  C &amp; P Telephone, 564 F.2d at 512 (same).  To the contrary, both the Senate and House Report stated that the chosen \"method of spreading the risk among all employers is intended by the committee to encourage the employment of handicapped workers.\"   S.Rep.

No. 98-426, 98 Stat. 1639 (1984), required abolishing the application of the manifestation requirement to &#167; 8(f) requests in cases where an occupational disease or injury does not appear until after employment has ceased.  One of the principles of statutory interpretation is that a \"settled construction of an important federal statute should not be disturbed unless and until Congress so decides.\"  Reves v.

Harris, 934 F.2d at 552.   As part of the introductory summary of the bill, the Report stated that the Amendments were \"intended to reduce the cost of Longshore coverage for employers in the covered industries in a manner which will disturb, to the most limited extent possible, the rights and benefits which the Longshore Act provides.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 98-570, at 3 (1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2734, 2736.   Thus, the Harris court deduced that an expansion of an individual's right to file a claim should be coupled with corresponding relief for the employer.  934 F.2d at 552.   But review of the entirety of that House Report, and other legislative documents, demonstrates that the quoted language cannot support the weight ascribed to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there is compelling evidence that Congress was well aware of, and in fact endorsed, application of the manifestation requirement to &#167; 8(f) cases.  A Senate Report states that \"[a]n employer able to demonstraate [sic] actual or, in some cases, constructive knowledge that an injured worker had a permanent disability which pre-dated a compensable injury is often able to shift to the Special Fund the responsibility for paying a very substantial portion of the amounts payable to the worker.\"   S.Rep. No. 97-498, at 35 (1982)(emphases added);  see also S.Rep. No. 98-81, at 34 (1983)(same).  We think this language is most reasonably read as referring to the manner in which courts of appeals had analyzed disputes concerning &#167; 8(f)--by requiring a showing of actual or constructive knowledge with evidence of \"manifestation.\"   Similarly, the House and Senate Reports on the 1984 bill expressly recognized that \"[s]ection 8(f) of the Act was designed to encourage employers to hire and retain disabled workers by distributing much of the additional cost of industrial injury attributable to pre-existing permanent disabilities among all employers and carriers subject to the Act.\"  S.Rep. No. 97-498, at 34-35;  S.Rep. No. 98-81, at 34 (same language).  Thus \"[t]he goals of Section 8(f) remain[ed] valid,\" S. Rep. 97-498, at 35, as part and parcel of the 1984 Amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately fatal to BIW's position is evidence concerning how Congress conceptualized its amendment allowing claims for long-latent occupational diseases.  Consider the following language from the House Report:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>The first change to the body which results from exposure to a harmful physical agent or a toxic substance often is not disabling.  Since it is the disability which should trigger the compensation claim, the Committee notes that unlike traumatic occurrences, the period of time between the 'injury' and the arising of a compensation claim in such a long-latency occupational disease case may be so long as to make the requirement that the employee file a Notice of Injury within thirty days of the 'injury' nonsensical....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the same effect, triggering the statute of limitations for the filing of compensation claims on the date of 'injury' makes little sense in the context of an occupational disease in which the disabling condition or the death does not follow immediately on the \"injury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.Rep. No. 98-570, at 10-11, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 2743-44 (emphases added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is important here is that in crafting this particular amendment concerning occupational disease, Congress conceptualized the \"injury\" as occurring at the time of exposure to the causative agent, which would necessarily have to occur during employment.  At the very least, this Report language precludes the argument that Congress was removing the manifestation requirement in instances involving these new occupational disease claims.  Because the \"injury\" was conceived as occurring during employment, &#167; 8(f) retained its regular meaning--applying when \"an employee having an existing permanent partial disability suffers injury.\"  33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 908(f)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Report language is affirmed by the amended statutory language itself;  and we must read statutes as a whole, rather than focus on isolated phrases.  Conroy v. Aniskoff, 507 U.S. 511, 515, 113 S.Ct. 1562, 1564-65, 123 L.Ed.2d 229 (1993).  As part of the occupational disease amendment, there also had to be a determination made as to how to calculate the amount of compensation paid in such cases.  Because the existing formula generally calculated compensation in reference to \"the average weekly wage ... at the time of the injury,\" 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 910, there was concern that very long-latent diseases would leave disabled retirees in an unfair economic situation because wages increased over time, H.R.Rep. No. 98-570, at 11-12.  It was therefore decided that in such instances, \"the time of injury shall be deemed to be the date on which the employee becomes aware, or ... should have been aware, of the relationship between the employment, the disease, and the death or disability.\"   98 Stat. at 1647-48 (codified at 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 910(i))(emphasis added).  Thus, by establishing the time of injury at a time closer to the onset of the disabling symptoms for purposes of wage calculation, Congress implicitly recognized that the injury-in-fact to the physical body occurred during the occupational exposure, but did not become disabling until later.  Although the 1984 Amendments were most certainly designed in part to \"reduce the cost of ... coverage for employers in the covered industries,\" H.R. Rep. 98-570, at 3, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 2736, quoted in Harris, 934 F.2d at 552, they did so in a multitude of ways.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Providing &#167; 8(f) relief to employers under facts such as these was simply not one of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We point out additional authority for our ruling.  Just after the 1984 Amendments, the Department of Labor amended the regulations interpreting the LHWCA to include, for the first time, the manifestation requirement.  50 Fed.Reg. 401 (1985), amended, 51 Fed.Reg. 4285 (1986)(codified at 20 C.F.R. &#167; 702.321(a)(1)(1997)).  Thus, if we found that the legislative history provided guidance less clear than it does, we would have little trouble deferring to the Department's interpretation, given our finding--in Part III, supra--that the manifestation requirement \"is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\"  Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument has also been made that, in instances such as these, the manifestation requirement serves no useful purpose because there is no potential for discrimination where the employee has already retired.  It is not, however, the manifestation requirement that has an anti-discrimination purpose, but &#167; 8(f) which has such a purpose.  The requirement is only a judicially created tool, developed in order to help determine when the purpose of &#167; 8(f) is being served.  As our analysis demonstrates, &#167; 8(f) was designed for a very specific reason--to remove the discriminatory incentive created by holding the last employer liable for the results of an aggravating injury.  The manifestation requirement ensures that requests for &#167; 8(f) relief remain within the intended scope of the Section.  The requirement is not an additional hurdle, but rather an integral part of &#167; 8(f).  We are therefore not at liberty to either apply or discard the requirement as different facts are presented, especially in the absence of congressional directive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think it is either unreasonable or unfair to preclude access by the employer to the Special Fund under the facts of this case.  There can be little doubt that Reno was exposed to asbestos during his working career at BIW, and BIW has not contested that Reno's exposure to asbestos during his employment at BIW caused his asbestosis.  They are therefore properly liable for the results of this work-related injury.  Because they have not met their burden of establishing a right to &#167; 8(f) relief, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We refer to Petitioners BIW and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company collectively as BIW</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We feel compelled to note that, contrary to BIW's description of Reno's work history, thirty-eight years is not properly characterized as \"employ[ment] for several years.\"   Br. of Petitioner at 2 (emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Harris is the only circuit court of appeals decision to reach this issue as of yet.

An exception from total liability is provided to employers under &#167; 8(f) of the LHWCA when the employer proves, among other things, that a permanent partial disability existed prior to the work-related injury.  33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 908(f).  In construing this exception, this court, along with other circuit courts of appeals, has required the employer to come forward with proof, which is not specifically elucidated in the statutory language, that the pre-existing disability was \"manifest to the employer\" before &#167; 8(f) relief can obtain.  See Part II, infra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1984 the LHWCA was amended, inter alia, to permit claimants to receive compensation when a long-latent occupational disease does not become apparent until after the employee has retired.  This appeal presents a novel question in the wake of that amendment:  may an employer obtain &#167; 8(f) relief when both the claimed pre-existing disability and compensable occupational disease do not become manifest until after the worker has retired from employment with the responsible employer?   In such instances, of course, the employer cannot show that the pre-existing disability was \"manifest to the employer\" because employment has ceased by the time both disabilities arise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the question before us is purely legal, the facts underlying the worker's claim need only be sketched briefly.  Phillip J. Reno voluntarily retired from Bath Iron Works (\"BIW\")<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> in 1985, after a total of thirty-eight years<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> in various positions.  It is uncontroverted that at various stages of his employment at BIW, Reno was exposed to asbestos.  In 1989 or 1990, several years after his retirement, Reno began to experience shortness of breath.  He was diagnosed at that time with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (emphysema) and interstitial lung disease.  Reno had been a cigarette smoker.  In June of 1991, Reno was referred to a pulmonary specialist who diagnosed obstructive pulmonary disease, primarily the result of cigarette smoking, and restrictive pulmonary disease resulting from Reno's asbestos exposure.  Reno was assessed a twenty percent whole person impairment due to the overall pulmonary impairments.  Reno filed a timely claim for workers' compensation benefits on the basis of his partial pulmonary disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW in turn gave notice of its intent to seek relief from the compensation liability under &#167; 8(f) of the LHWCA on the theory that Reno's smoking-related emphysema was a permanent partial disability which predated the work-related injury of asbestosis.  On December 3, 1993, the Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") awarded benefits to Reno and denied BIW the &#167; 8(f) relief.  Relying on our precedent, the ALJ held that in order to obtain such relief, an employer must demonstrate that the pre-existing disability was manifest to the employer prior to retirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BIW appealed the legal basis of the &#167; 8(f) decision to the Department of Labor's Benefits Review Board.  After no action, the ALJ's decision became the final order of the Board on September 12, 1996.  See Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-134, 110 Stat. at 1321-219 (April 26, 1996).  Our jurisdiction over the appeal is proper under 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 921(c).

Reno's situation falls under the latter category.  The first sentence of the section contains the language crucial to all requests for relief:  &#167; 8(f) cases are those \"in which an employee having an existing permanent partial disability suffers injury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute, however, is silent on the meaning of \"existing permanent partial disability.\"   See 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 902 (definitions).  At first blush then, BIW's argument makes some sense;  it is, at least, an arguable reading to suggest that Reno's emphysema was an \"existing permanent partial disability\" by the time the asbestosis made itself known.  Leaving aside the question of when injury occurs for purposes of long-latent occupational diseases,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> the issue turns to a large degree on how one interprets the word \"existing.\"   For purposes of this appeal, does it mean existing during employment, or existing before another disability becomes apparent?   The manifestation requirement, to which we now turn, was in large measure the result of courts' determinations on the meaning of \"existing\" disability.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The font of the manifestation requirement can be traced to the Supreme Court's opinion in Lawson v.

There, the Court was asked to determine the proper meaning of \"disability\" in the context of &#167; 8(f)'s coverage for \"previous disabilit[ies].\"  Id. at 200, 69 S.Ct. at 504.   Because the definitional portion of the LHWCA defined \"disability\" in relation to an injury \"arising out of and in the course of employment,\" id.  (quoting LHWCA &#167; 2(2)), a thorny question of statutory interpretation emerged:  must the \"previous disability\" also arise out of an employment-related injury?   After a review of the Act's legislative history, id. at 201-04, 69 S.Ct. at 504-06, the Court answered in the negative, id. at 206, 69 S.Ct. at 506-07.  \"If we read the definition [of disability] into &#167; 8(f)(1) in a mechanical fashion, we create obvious incongruities in the language, and we destroy one of the major purposes of the second injury provision:  the prevention of employer discrimination against handicapped workers.\"  Id. at 201, 69 S.Ct. at 504 (emphasis added).  It was Lawson generally, and this emphasized language in particular which the courts of appeals have seized upon in developing the manifestation requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1970, the D.C.

Denying &#167; 8(f) relief to the employer, the court stated that \"nothing in the record gives any indication that [the claimant], up to the time of his [work-related] injuries, showed a sufficient degree of social maladaption due to limited intelligence that his disability could be fairly classed as 'manifest.' \"  Id. at 1268.   The American Mutual court's construction of &#167; 8(f) was informed by what it determined to be the primary purpose of the &#167; 8(f) exception:  \"to remove that aspect of discrimination against the disabled which would otherwise be encouraged by the very statute intended to protect them.\"  Id. at 1267.

Braxton of the Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company reiterated his concern that the Act would require employers to \"examine every man who applies for work;  and the poor dog that is suffering from some disease will be turned away from our plant because ... as a matter of life and death financially we will have to turn him down.\"   Hearings on S.3170 Before the House Committee on the Judiciary, 69th Cong., 1st Sess. at 196 (1926).  In rebuttal, a witness in favor of the legislation testified as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>The second injury proposition is as much to the advantage of the employer and his interests as it is for the benefit of the employee.  It protects that employer who has hired, say, a one-eyed worker who goes and loses his other eye and becomes a total disability.  The employer without this sort of thing would have to pay total permanent disability compensation.  Then, on the other hand, this also protects the worker with one eye from being denied employment on account of his being an extra risk. Now by simply taking this up in this way it is possible to protect both the employer and to protect the one-eyed employee also.  It is one of the best social inventions in legislation of which I have knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 208 (testimony of Mr. Andrews).

Because the legislative history of the original Act demonstrates that &#167; 8(f) was specifically designed to reduce the incentive for discrimination, it makes logical sense that \"only potential discriminators [are] eligible for Section 8(f) relief.\"  Lockhart, 980 F.2d at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1972, the LHWCA was amended,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> see Longshoreman's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act Amendments of 1972, Pub.L. 92-576, 86 Stat. 1251 (1972), \"[t]he principle purpose of ...

No. 92-1125, at 1 (1972).  As part of the 1972 Amendments, the language of &#167; 8(f) was changed, substituting the language of \"previous disability\" for the current language of \"existing permanent partial disability.\"   86 Stat. at 1257.  The Amendments also opened the door for employers to &#167; 8(f) relief where the resulting combined disability was not total, but partial.

Harris, 934 F.2d at 552.   As part of the introductory summary of the bill, the Report stated that the Amendments were \"intended to reduce the cost of Longshore coverage for employers in the covered industries in a manner which will disturb, to the most limited extent possible, the rights and benefits which the Longshore Act provides.\"   H.R.Rep. No. 98-570, at 3 (1983), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2734, 2736.   Thus, the Harris court deduced that an expansion of an individual's right to file a claim should be coupled with corresponding relief for the employer.  934 F.2d at 552.   But review of the entirety of that House Report, and other legislative documents, demonstrates that the quoted language cannot support the weight ascribed to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there is compelling evidence that Congress was well aware of, and in fact endorsed, application of the manifestation requirement to &#167; 8(f) cases.  A Senate Report states that \"[a]n employer able to demonstraate [sic] actual or, in some cases, constructive knowledge that an injured worker had a permanent disability which pre-dated a compensable injury is often able to shift to the Special Fund the responsibility for paying a very substantial portion of the amounts payable to the worker.\"   S.Rep. No. 97-498, at 35 (1982)(emphases added);  see also S.Rep. No. 98-81, at 34 (1983)(same).  We think this language is most reasonably read as referring to the manner in which courts of appeals had analyzed disputes concerning &#167; 8(f)--by requiring a showing of actual or constructive knowledge with evidence of \"manifestation.\"   Similarly, the House and Senate Reports on the 1984 bill expressly recognized that \"[s]ection 8(f) of the Act was designed to encourage employers to hire and retain disabled workers by distributing much of the additional cost of industrial injury attributable to pre-existing permanent disabilities among all employers and carriers subject to the Act.\"  S.Rep. No. 97-498, at 34-35;  S.Rep. No. 98-81, at 34 (same language).  Thus \"[t]he goals of Section 8(f) remain[ed] valid,\" S. Rep. 97-498, at 35, as part and parcel of the 1984 Amendments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately fatal to BIW's position is evidence concerning how Congress conceptualized its amendment allowing claims for long-latent occupational diseases.  Consider the following language from the House Report:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>The first change to the body which results from exposure to a harmful physical agent or a toxic substance often is not disabling.  Since it is the disability which should trigger the compensation claim, the Committee notes that unlike traumatic occurrences, the period of time between the 'injury' and the arising of a compensation claim in such a long-latency occupational disease case may be so long as to make the requirement that the employee file a Notice of Injury within thirty days of the 'injury' nonsensical....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To the same effect, triggering the statute of limitations for the filing of compensation claims on the date of 'injury' makes little sense in the context of an occupational disease in which the disabling condition or the death does not follow immediately on the \"injury.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">H.R.Rep. No. 98-570, at 10-11, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 2743-44 (emphases added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is important here is that in crafting this particular amendment concerning occupational disease, Congress conceptualized the \"injury\" as occurring at the time of exposure to the causative agent, which would necessarily have to occur during employment.  At the very least, this Report language precludes the argument that Congress was removing the manifestation requirement in instances involving these new occupational disease claims.  Because the \"injury\" was conceived as occurring during employment, &#167; 8(f) retained its regular meaning--applying when \"an employee having an existing permanent partial disability suffers injury.\"  33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 908(f)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Report language is affirmed by the amended statutory language itself;  and we must read statutes as a whole, rather than focus on isolated phrases.  Conroy v. Aniskoff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112840\"><a href=\"/opinion/112840/conroy-v-aniskoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 515, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112840\"><a href=\"/opinion/112840/conroy-v-aniskoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span> (1993).  As part of the occupational disease amendment, there also had to be a determination made as to how to calculate the amount of compensation paid in such cases.  Because the existing formula generally calculated compensation in reference to \"the average weekly wage ... at the time of the injury,\" 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 910, there was concern that very long-latent diseases would leave disabled retirees in an unfair economic situation because wages increased over time, H.R.Rep. No. 98-570, at 11-12.  It was therefore decided that in such instances, \"the time of injury shall be deemed to be the date on which the employee becomes aware, or ... should have been aware, of the relationship between the employment, the disease, and the death or disability.\"   98 Stat. at 1647-48 (codified at 33 U.S.C.A. &#167; 910(i))(emphasis added).  Thus, by establishing the time of injury at a time closer to the onset of the disabling symptoms for purposes of wage calculation, Congress implicitly recognized that the injury-in-fact to the physical body occurred during the occupational exposure, but did not become disabling until later.  Although the 1984 Amendments were most certainly designed in part to \"reduce the cost of ... coverage for employers in the covered industries,\" H.R. Rep. 98-570, at 3, U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News at 2736, quoted in Harris, 934 F.2d at 552, they did so in a multitude of ways.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a>  Providing &#167; 8(f) relief to employers under facts such as these was simply not one of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We point out additional authority for our ruling.  Just after the 1984 Amendments, the Department of Labor amended the regulations interpreting the LHWCA to include, for the first time, the manifestation requirement.  50 Fed.Reg. 401 (1985), amended, 51 Fed.Reg. 4285 (1986)(codified at 20 C.F.R. &#167; 702.321(a)(1)(1997)).  Thus, if we found that the legislative history provided guidance less clear than it does, we would have little trouble deferring to the Department's interpretation, given our finding--in Part III, supra--that the manifestation requirement \"is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\"  Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span>, 843, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It is not, however, the manifestation requirement that has an anti-discrimination purpose, but &#167; 8(f) which has such a purpose.  The requirement is only a judicially created tool, developed in order to help determine when the purpose of &#167; 8(f) is being served.  As our analysis demonstrates, &#167; 8(f) was designed for a very specific reason--to remove the discriminatory incentive created by holding the last employer liable for the results of an aggravating injury.  The manifestation requirement ensures that requests for &#167; 8(f) relief remain within the intended scope of the Section.  The requirement is not an additional hurdle, but rather an integral part of &#167; 8(f).  We are therefore not at liberty to either apply or discard the requirement as different facts are presented, especially in the absence of congressional directive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not think it is either unreasonable or unfair to preclude access by the employer to the Special Fund under the facts of this case.  There can be little doubt that Reno was exposed to asbestos during his working career at BIW, and BIW has not contested that Reno's exposure to asbestos during his employment at BIW caused his asbestosis.  They are therefore properly liable for the results of this work-related injury.  Because they have not met their burden of establishing a right to &#167; 8(f) relief, the decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> We refer to Petitioners BIW and Liberty Mutual Insurance Company collectively as BIW</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We feel compelled to note that, contrary to BIW's description of Reno's work history, thirty-eight years is not properly characterized as \"employ[ment] for several years.\"   Br. of Petitioner at 2 (emphasis added)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Harris is the only circuit court of appeals decision to reach this issue as of yet.
