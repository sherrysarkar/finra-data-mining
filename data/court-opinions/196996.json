Jerome  Washington appeals  from the\r                                 \r\n\ndistrict court's  grant  of summary  judgment in  defendants'\r\n\nfavor  on   his  claim  that   defendants  were  deliberately\r\n\nindifferent to  his medical needs and safety  in violation of\r\n\nthe  Eighth Amendment  to the  Constitution.   We affirm  for\r\n\nsubstantially  the  reasons  given in  the  district  court's\r\n\ndecision dated May 8, 1995, adding only a brief comment.  \r\n\n          Washington   correctly   claims   on  appeal   that\r\n\ndefendants'  affidavit in support  of summary judgment failed\r\n\nto  recite   facts  which  suggested   that  defendant   John\r\n\nMcClintock had reason to suspect that Washington might injure\r\n\nhimself  if left  in a  cold cell.   Nonetheless,  the record\r\n\nsupports the  court's determination that defendants  were not\r\n\ndeliberately   indifferent  to  Washington's   needs  by  not\r\n\nproviding him with a blanket.  Washington had told McClintock\r\n\nthat he  had placed  a noose around  his neck, made  from his\r\n\nbedding,  because his  cell  was cold.    At the  same  time,\r\n\nhowever, he had also told McClintock that he did not want  to\r\n\nreturn to the general prison population because he feared for\r\n\nhis  safety.    McClintock's   notes  indicate  that  he  was\r\n\nconcerned that  Washington might hurt himself  because of his\r\n\nfear about  being returned to the general  population.  Under\r\n\nthe   circumstances,  McClintock's   decision  not   to  give\r\n\nWashington a  blanket was reasonable,  even if  he knew  that\r\n\nWashington had once placed a noose around his neck because he\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nwas cold, especially  since he continued regular  observation\r\n\nof Washington and informed  him that he could have  a blanket\r\n\nthe next day if  the night passed \"without incident.\"   Under\r\n\nthe circumstances,  McClintock  did  not  act  in  deliberate\r\n\nindifference to Washington's needs,  and summary judgment  in\r\n\ndefendants' favor was proper.  \r\n\n          Affirmed.  \r                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
