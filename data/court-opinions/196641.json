On appeal, plaintiffs  challenge several trial\r\n\ncourt rulings,  including  the denial  of  their motion  for  new\r\n\ntrial.  We affirm the district court judgment.\r\n\n                                I\r                                          I\r\n\n                            BACKGROUND\r                                      BACKGROUND\r                                                \r\n\n          On November 4, 1991, Hiram  Fernandez was taken to  the\r\n\nemergency room  of Federico  Trilla Hospital in  Carolina, Puerto\r\n\nRico, after awakening  with chest pains,  severe leg cramps,  and\r\n\nvomiting.   The 64-year-old  Fernandez informed Dr.  Pedro Rivera\r\n\nBermudez  (\"Dr. Rivera\") that the chest pain had stopped after he\r\n\nvomited,  but  the severe  leg pain  had  not abated.   Fernandez\r\n\nfailed to tell  Dr. Rivera that he was taking medication for both\r\n\nasthma and  hypertension.  Since  Fernandez did  not complain  of\r\n\nrecurring chest pain, and his vital statistics were within normal\r\n\nor borderline  range, Dr. Rivera tentatively  diagnosed a pinched\r\n\nnerve  but  nonetheless  ordered an  electrocardiogram  (EKG),  a\r\n\nurinalysis, and an x-ray  of the lumbosacral region and  the left\r\n\nleg.  All tests were negative.\r\n\n          A  few hours  later,  Dr. Rivera  was  relieved in  the\r\n\nemergency room by Dr.  Ricardo Martinez Cortinez (\"Dr. Martinez\")\r\n\nwhose examination  confirmed that Fernandez was  in stable condi-\r\n\ntion, with no complaints of chest pain.  As a blood test showed a\r\n\nslightly  elevated  white blood  count,  Dr.  Martinez ordered  a\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nsecond urinalysis,  as well  as a chest  x-ray, to  rule out  any\r\n\nurinary or  pulmonary infection which  might have been  caused by\r\n\nthe vomiting.  The chest x-ray coincidently revealed that Fernan-\r\n\ndez  had a dilated aorta, which Dr. Martinez attributed to normal\r\n\nborderline hypertension  in a  patient of Fernandez'  age, rather\r\n\nthan  an  emergent  symptom  of aortal  dissection,  a  condition\r\n\nusually accompanied by excruciating  and unrelenting chest  pain,\r\n\nfainting  spells, profuse  sweating, and  tachycardia.   Like Dr.\r\n\nRivera, Dr. Martinez diagnosed a pinched nerve.  Shortly thereaf-\r\n\nter Dr. Martinez referred  Fernandez to a neuropathic specialist,\r\n\nand discharged him. \r\n\n          The next  day, when  Fernandez was unable  to recognize\r\n\nfamily  members,  he was  taken  to his  personal  physician, Dr.\r\n\nAbelardo Vargas, who performed a physical examination and another\r\n\nEKG (also negative), and ordered an upper gastrointestinal series\r\n\nto  determine whether there was a hiatal  hernia.   The next day,\r\n\non  his way to undergo these tests, Fernandez collapsed and died.\r\n\nAn autopsy  revealed the cause of  death as a  dissected aorta, a\r\n\ncondition treatable with surgery in more than 90% of cases.\r\n\n          The  decedent's  spouse,  children,  and  grandchildren\r\n\nfiled  a  medical  malpractice  suit in  federal  district  court\r\n\npursuant  to 28  U.S.C.    1332 (diversity  jurisdiction) against\r\n\nDrs. Rivera,  Martinez, and Vargas, and  against various insurers\r\n\nof  the  Federico  Trilla  Hospital, including  Global  Insurance\r\n\nCompany.    Subsequently, Dr.  Vargas  was dismissed  as  a party\r\n\ndefendant.  \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          At trial,  Dr. William T. Brown,  a Miami-based cardiac\r\n\nspecialist, provided expert testimony  in behalf of plaintiffs on\r\n\nthe  applicable duty of care.  Drs. Rivera and Martinez testified\r\n\nin  their  own  defense,  but presented  no  independent  medical\r\n\ntestimony.  After the jury returned a verdict for all defendants,\r\n\nplaintiffs unsuccessfully  filed a motion for  new trial pursuant\r\n\nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59, then brought this appeal.\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\n          Appellants challenge  four trial court rulings.  First,\r\n\nthey focus  on the denial  of their request  for rebuttal  to the\r\n\nclosing argument  made  by the  defense.   Although  trial  court\r\n\nrulings on the conduct, timing, and ordering of closing arguments\r\n\nare  reviewed only for abuse of discretion, see Bonilla v. Yamaha\r                                                                           \r\n\nMotors Corp., 955  F.2d 150, 155 (1st Cir. 1992); see also United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Wood, 982 F.2d 1, 4  (1st Cir. 1992), appellants insist\r                        \r\n\nthat civil-action plaintiffs  have an absolute right to rebut the\r                                                        \r\n\nclosing argument  of  the defense.   See  Martin v.  Chesebrough-\r                                                                           \r\n\nPond's, Inc., 614 F.2d  498 (5th Cir. 1980) (noting  that \"[n]or-\r                      \r\n\nmally the  party with the burden  of proof has the  right to open\r\n\nand  close,\" but  holding that  a  particular codefendant  had no\r                                                                   \r\n\nright to  rebuttal as against  another codefendant where  the two\r\n\nhad asserted mutual cross-claims).  \r                             \r\n\n          Appellants  are mistaken.    The Martin  court did  not\r                                                           \r\n\ndescribe  a  civil-action  plaintiff's  \"right\"  to  rebuttal  as\r\n\nabsolute,  but merely  reconfirmed  that the  decision to  permit\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nrebuttal is  a procedural  matter  which rests  within the  sound\r\n\ndiscretion  of the trial judge, id. at  501, and rarely (if ever)\r                                             \r\n\nprovides fertile  ground for appeal.   See Lancaster  v. Collins,\r                                                                          \r\n\n115 U.S. 222,  225 (1885);  Montwood Corp. v.

Defense\r\n\ncounsel  argued to the jury that Dr. Vargas, the decedent's long-\r\n\ntime personal physician,  was the  one most likely  to have  been\r\n\nnegligent  since he  was the  last to  treat Fernandez,  and more\r\n\nfamiliar  with  his medical  history.    Defense counsel  further\r\n\nargued that  Dr. Vargas,  like the defendant-physicians,  had not\r\n\nsuspected  that the  Fernandez  symptoms indicated  an  incipient\r\n\naortal dissection but rather a  hiatal hernia.  Appellants there-\r\n\nfore  contend that  they  were entitled  to  remind the  jury  in\r\n\nrebuttal that:  (1)  the defendants had the right to  implead Dr.\r\n\nVargas if they  believed he was the only  negligent party and the\r\n\nsole  proximate cause of Fernandez' death, and (2) Dr. Vargas had\r\n\nnot  treated Fernandez  in a  hospital; thus,  unlike defendants,\r\n\ncould not as readily have obtained a chest x-ray.  \r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n            As plaintiffs failed to challenge the statements made\r\n\nby  defense counsel in closing argument, we review only for plain\r\n\nerror.   See Johnson  v. National Sea Prods.,  Ltd., 35 F.3d 626,\r                                                             \r\n\n631 (1st  Cir. 1994).   The  statements  made by  the defense  in\r\n\nclosing were  in  no sense  inflammatory, but  rather a  measured\r\n\nresponse to earlier observations by plaintiffs' counsel that \"Dr.\r\n\nVargas [is not] responsible  for anything here simply  because he\r\n\ndid not have the x-rays that  these defendants had the benefit of\r\n\nhaving because he was not in a position of having a full clinical\r\n\npicture.\"    Indeed,  plaintiffs  not only  invited  the  defense\r\n\nresponse they now claim gave rise to  a vital need for rebuttal,1\r\n\nbut their  invitation was itself  a sufficient \"reminder\"  to the\r\n\njury that plaintiffs had adduced evidence that Dr. Vargas did not\r\n\ntreat Fernandez in a hospital  setting where x-rays were  readily\r\n\nobtainable.   Thus, the district court ruling was well within its\r\n\nsound discretion.  \r\n\n          In  addition,  though Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. 14(a)  permits\r                                                                           \r\n\ndefendants to implead a joint tortfeasor, see also Reyes-Lopez v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMisener Marine  Constr. Co., 854  F.2d 529,  535 n. 23  (1st Cir.\r                                     \r\n\n1988) (citing  to Puerto Rico case  law allowing joint-tortfeasor\r\n\ncontribution), Rule 14 is not mandatory.  Appellants do not cite,\r\n\nnor have we found, any authority for  the proposition that a jury\r\n\nmust be permitted to draw an adverse inference from a defendant's\r\n\ndecision  to forego a Rule  14 impleader.   We therefore conclude\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In fact,  defense counsel expressly noted  in closing argu-\r\nment:  \"This is the same Dr.  Abelardo Vargas and I refer to this\r\nbecause brother counsel did refer to it [in his closing].\"\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nthat there was no plain error.\r\n\n          Second,  appellants  claim  that  it was  an  abuse  of\r\n\ndiscretion to  refuse their timely  request to instruct  the jury\r\n\nthat defendants could have impleaded Dr. Vargas.  For the reasons\r\n\ndiscussed above,  we find no abuse  of discretion.  See  Makuc v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAmerican  Honda Motor Co., 835 F.2d  389, 393 n.1 (1st Cir. 1987)\r                                   \r\n\n(noting that proponent  must cite to  some legal authority  which\r\n\nwould support its proposed jury instruction).\r\n\n          Third, appellants  contend that over-repetition  of the\r\n\ndistrict court's unexceptionable jury instruction     that plain-\r\n\ntiffs must establish  all elements of their  negligence claims   \r\n\nconstituted reversible error because it exaggerated the burden of\r\n\nproof in the minds  of the jury.  See United  States v. Assi, 748\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  62, 66  (2d Cir.  1984).   Similar reversible  error arose,\r\n\nplaintiffs say, from the  district court's over-repetition of its\r\n\n\"error in judgment\"  instruction, viz., that  a physician is  not\r                                                \r\n\nliable under Puerto Rico law for a faulty diagnosis or failure to\r\n\ntreat if  there existed \"a reasonable or educated doubt as to the\r\n\n[appropriate]  medical  course  to  [have]  follow[ed].\"2    Once\r\n\nagain, we must disagree.\r\n\n           As appellants  failed to object to the burden-of-proof\r\n\ninstructions  before the jury retired  to deliberate, see Fed.

See Kerr-Selgas  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Appellants  also argue that no \"error-in-judgment\" instruc-\r\ntion was  appropriate because defendants failed  to adduce expert\r\nmedical testimony to support a jury finding that \"a reasonable or\r\neducated doubt\" existed.  But see infra pp. 8-10. \r                                                 \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nAmerican Airlines,  Inc., 69  F.3d  1205, 1213  (1st Cir.  1995).\r                                  \r\n\nEven though there may be a threshold beyond which further repeti-\r\n\ntion of an otherwise proper jury instruction creates an unaccept-\r\n\nable risk that the  jury will be misled, see  Davet v. Maccarone,\r                                                                          \r\n\n973 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.  1992), appellants do not approach such\r\n\na showing by citing three brief references to the burden of proof\r\n\nin the eleven-page jury charge.  \r\n\n          Similarly, though plaintiffs asserted a contemporaneous\r\n\nobjection to the \"multiple\" error-in-judgment instructions, there\r\n\nwas no  error.  A correct understanding  of the error-in-judgment\r\n\nprinciple, the  seminal legal concept  defining the duty  of care\r\n\nincumbent upon  physicians under Puerto  Rico medical malpractice\r\n\nlaw, was vital  to a  proper jury verdict.   Moreover, the  trial\r\n\ncourt's  error-in-judgment  instructions,  individually   and  in\r\n\ncombination, were neither suggestive nor prejudicial.\r\n\n          Finally, appellants claim that the district court erred\r\n\nin denying  their motion for new  trial. See Fed. R.  Civ. P. 59.\r                                                      \r\n\nPlaintiffs'  independent expert, Dr.  Brown, testified  that Drs.\r\n\nRivera and  Martinez were negligent in failing  to record Fernan-\r\n\ndez'  past medical history on the hospital charts; and in failing\r\n\nto diagnose the  aortal dissection  on November 4,  based on  the\r\n\ncomplaints of earlier  chest pain, and the chest x-ray disclosing\r\n\naortal dilation.    Appellants argue  that the  jury verdict  was\r\n\nagainst the weight of the evidence  because the duty of care in a\r\n\nmalpractice  action can  only  be proven  through expert  medical\r\n\ntestimony;  their expert,  Dr.  Brown, was  the only  independent\r                                                              \r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nmedical expert to testify at trial; and the self-serving,  biased\r\n\ntestimony by the defendant-physicians themselves concerning their\r\n\nown duties of care was inherently untrustworthy. \r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n            A Rule  59 ruling,  denying  a motion  for new  trial\r\n\nbased on  an alleged insufficiency  of evidence, is  reviewed for\r\n\nabuse of discretion.   See Lama v. Borras, 16  F.3d 473, 477 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1994).  A new trial should  be granted only if the verdict,\r\n\nthough rationally based on the evidence, \"was  so clearly against\r\n\nthe weight of the evidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage\r\n\nof  justice.\"   Id.  But  where there is  substantial evidence to\r                             \r\n\nsupport the verdict,  it is \"'only in a very  unusual case'\" that\r\n\ndenial of a Rule 59 motion  will be ruled an abuse of discretion.\r\n\nWagenmann v. Adams, 829  F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.  1987) (citation\r                            \r\n\nomitted).  This is not such a case. \r\n\n          At  trial, plaintiffs had to establish:   (1) the basic\r\n\nnorms of knowledge and medical care applicable to general practi-\r\n\ntioners or  specialists;   (2) that the  defendant-physicians did\r\n\nnot  meet these basic norms in their treatment of Fernandez;  and\r\n\n(3) a causal relation between the  defendants' acts or omissions,\r\n\nand  Fernandez' death.  See Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San\r                                                                           \r\n\nJuan, 1 F.3d 74, 77 n.2  (1st Cir. 1993).  Although jurors rarely\r              \r\n\nare  able to  determine the applicable  standard of  medical care\r\n\nwithout the  benefit of expert  testimony, under Puerto  Rico law\r\n\n\"there exists  always a presumption that  the treating physicians\r                                             \r\n\nhave observed a reasonable degree of care . . . in the process of\r\n\ngiving medical attention and  treatment.

Thus, appellants' premise    that malpractice defendants\r\n\nmust  invariably introduce  independent  expert testimony  on the\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\napplicable duty of care    is flawed.  Although  defendant-physi-\r\n\ncians often do adduce independent  expert testimony on the appli-\r\n\ncable standard of medical care, the jury's implicit  rejection of\r\n\nDr.  Brown's  testimony in  this  case was  itself  sufficient to\r\n\nsupport  a  verdict  for  defendants because  of  the  rebuttable\r\n\npresumption of due care indulged under Puerto Rico law, see id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n          The  jury  was  not  compelled to  credit  Dr.  Brown's\r\n\ntestimony.  \"While not allowed to speculate, the factfinder is of\r\n\ncourse  free to  find some  experts more  credible than  others.\"\r\n\nLama, 16 F.3d at  478.  On cross-examination, Dr.  Brown admitted\r              \r\n\nthat he was not able  to read or speak Spanish fluently,  that he\r\n\nhad not  been provided initially with  certified English transla-\r\n\ntions of the  hospital and medical records relating to Fernandez,\r\n\nand that until  shortly before  trial he had  relied on  informal\r\n\ntranslations    whose accuracy was seriously disputed at trial   \r\n\nprepared by his  secretary and plaintiffs'  counsel.3  Given  the\r\n\ninfirmities in the only expert testimony presented by plaintiffs,\r\n\nthere was no abuse of discretion in denying a new trial.4 \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3For example, the hospital records stated that Fernandez had\r\nvomited before  arriving at the  hospital, and that  this \"ended\"\r\nhis  chest pain, while the informal translations relied on by Dr.\r\nBrown  merely indicated that the  chest pain had  \"improved.\"  In\r\naddition,  presented with a  medical treatise  describing typical\r\nsymptoms  of an  impending  aortal dissection,  Dr. Brown's  only\r\nresponse was  the unexplicated assertion  that he simply  did not\r\ncare what the medical treatise provided.  \r\n\n     4As concerns the contention by Dr. Brown that the defendant-\r\nphysicians were negligent in failing to record Fernandez' medical\r\nhistory  on the medical charts,  the jury was  entitled to credit\r\nthe defendant-physicians'  testimony that they left  the \"medical\r\nhistory\" section  of the hospital record  blank because Fernandez\r\ninformed them  (inaccurately) that he had  no significant medical\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\n          The  district court  judgment is  affirmed.

On appeal, plaintiffs challenge several trial court rulings, including the denial of their motion for new trial.   We affirm the district court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 4, 1991, Hiram Fernandez was taken to the emergency room of Federico Trilla Hospital in Carolina, Puerto Rico, after awakening with chest pains, severe leg cramps, and vomiting.   The 64-year-old Fernandez informed Dr. Pedro Rivera Bermudez (\"Dr. Rivera\") that the chest pain had stopped after he vomited, but the severe leg pain had not abated.   Fernandez failed to tell Dr. Rivera that he was taking medication for both asthma and hypertension.   Since Fernandez did not complain of recurring chest pain, and his vital statistics were within normal or borderline range, Dr. Rivera tentatively diagnosed a pinched nerve but nonetheless ordered an electrocardiogram (EKG), a urinalysis, and an x-ray of the lumbosacral region and the left leg.   All tests were negative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few hours later, Dr. Rivera was relieved in the emergency room by Dr. Ricardo Martinez Cortinez (\"Dr. Martinez\") whose examination confirmed that Fernandez was in stable condition, with no complaints of chest pain.   As a blood test showed a slightly elevated white blood count, Dr. Martinez ordered a second urinalysis, as well as a chest x-ray, to rule out any urinary or pulmonary infection which might have been caused by the vomiting.   The chest x-ray coincidently revealed that Fernandez had a dilated aorta, which Dr. Martinez attributed to normal borderline hypertension in a patient of Fernandez' age, rather than an emergent symptom of aortal dissection, a condition usually accompanied by excruciating and unrelenting chest pain, fainting spells, profuse sweating, and tachycardia.   Like Dr. Rivera, Dr. Martinez diagnosed a pinched nerve.   Shortly thereafter Dr. Martinez referred Fernandez to a neuropathic specialist, and discharged him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, when Fernandez was unable to recognize family members, he was taken to his personal physician, Dr. Abelardo Vargas, who performed a physical examination and another EKG (also negative), and ordered an upper gastrointestinal series to determine whether there was a hiatal hernia.   The next day, on his way to undergo these tests, Fernandez collapsed and died.   An autopsy revealed the cause of death as a dissected aorta, a condition treatable with surgery in more than 90% of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decedent's spouse, children, and grandchildren filed a medical malpractice suit in federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332 (diversity jurisdiction) against Drs. Rivera, Martinez, and Vargas, and against various insurers of the Federico Trilla Hospital, including Global Insurance Company.   Subsequently, Dr. Vargas was dismissed as a party defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Dr. William T. Brown, a Miami-based cardiac specialist, provided expert testimony in behalf of plaintiffs on the applicable duty of care.   Drs. Rivera and Martinez testified in their own defense, but presented no independent medical testimony.   After the jury returned a verdict for all defendants, plaintiffs unsuccessfully filed a motion for new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59, then brought this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge four trial court rulings.   First, they focus on the denial of their request for rebuttal to the closing argument made by the defense.   Although trial court rulings on the conduct, timing, and ordering of closing arguments are reviewed only for abuse of discretion, see Bonilla v. Yamaha Motors Corp., 955 F.2d 150, 155 (1st Cir.1992);  see also United States v. Wood, 982 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1992), appellants insist that civil-action plaintiffs have an absolute right to rebut the closing argument of the defense.   See Martin v. Chesebrough-Pond's, Inc., 614 F.2d 498 (5th Cir.1980) (noting that \"[n]ormally the party with the burden of proof has the right to open and close,\" but holding that a particular codefendant had no right to rebuttal as against another codefendant where the two had asserted mutual cross-claims).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants are mistaken.   The Martin court did not describe a civil-action plaintiff's \"right\" to rebuttal as absolute, but merely reconfirmed that the decision to permit rebuttal is a procedural matter which rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge, id. at 501, and rarely (if ever) provides fertile ground for appeal.   See Lancaster v. Collins, 115 U.S. 222, 225, 6 S.Ct. 33, 34-35, 29 L.Ed. 373 (1885);  Montwood Corp. v. Hot Springs Theme Park, 766 F.2d 359, 364 (8th Cir.1985);  Moreau v. Oppenheim, 663 F.2d 1300, 1311 (5th Cir.1981), cert. denied, 458 U.S. 1107, 102 S.Ct. 3486, 73 L.Ed.2d 1368 (1982);  Commercial Iron &amp; Metal Co. v. Bache Halsey Stuart, Inc., 581 F.2d 246, 249 (10th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 914, 99 S.Ct. 1229, 59 L.Ed.2d 463 (1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants further argue that rebuttal was vital to counteract the \"inflammatory\" statements made in argument by defense counsel, who portrayed, as inexplicable, plaintiffs' voluntary dismissal of their claims against Dr. Vargas.   Defense counsel argued to the jury that Dr. Vargas, the decedent's long-time personal physician, was the one most likely to have been negligent since he was the last to treat Fernandez, and more familiar with his medical history.   Defense counsel further argued that Dr. Vargas, like the defendant-physicians, had not suspected that the Fernandez symptoms indicated an incipient aortal dissection but rather a hiatal hernia.   Appellants therefore contend that they were entitled to remind the jury in rebuttal that:  (1) the defendants had the right to implead Dr. Vargas if they believed he was the only negligent party and the sole proximate cause of Fernandez' death, and (2) Dr. Vargas had not treated Fernandez in a hospital;  thus, unlike defendants, could not as readily have obtained a chest x-ray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As plaintiffs failed to challenge the statements made by defense counsel in closing argument, we review only for plain error.   See Johnson v. National Sea Prods., Ltd., 35 F.3d 626, 631 (1st Cir.1994).   The statements made by the defense in closing were in no sense inflammatory, but rather a measured response to earlier observations by plaintiffs' counsel that \"Dr. Vargas [is not] responsible for anything here simply because he did not have the x-rays that these defendants had the benefit of having because he was not in a position of having a full clinical picture.\"   Indeed, plaintiffs not only invited the defense response they now claim gave rise to a vital need for rebuttal,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but their invitation was itself a sufficient \"reminder\" to the jury that plaintiffs had adduced evidence that Dr. Vargas did not treat Fernandez in a hospital setting where x-rays were readily obtainable.   Thus, the district court ruling was well within its sound discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, though Fed.R.Civ.P. 14(a) permits defendants to implead a joint tortfeasor, see also Reyes-Lopez v. Misener Marine Constr.  Co., 854 F.2d 529, 535 n. 23 (1st Cir.1988) (citing to Puerto Rico case law allowing joint-tortfeasor contribution), Rule 14 is not mandatory.   Appellants do not cite, nor have we found, any authority for the proposition that a jury must be permitted to draw an adverse inference from a defendant's decision to forego a Rule 14 impleader.   We therefore conclude that there was no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellants claim that it was an abuse of discretion to refuse their timely request to instruct the jury that defendants could have impleaded Dr. Vargas.   For the reasons discussed above, we find no abuse of discretion.   See Makuc v. American Honda Motor Co., 835 F.2d 389, 393 n. 1 (1st Cir.1987) (noting that proponent must cite to some legal authority which would support its proposed jury instruction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, appellants contend that over-repetition of the district court's unexceptionable jury instruction--that plaintiffs must establish all elements of their negligence claims--constituted reversible error because it exaggerated the burden of proof in the minds of the jury.   See United States v. Assi, 748 F.2d 62, 66 (2d Cir.1984).   Similar reversible error arose, plaintiffs say, from the district court's over-repetition of its \"error in judgment\" instruction, viz., that a physician is not liable under Puerto Rico law for a faulty diagnosis or failure to treat if there existed \"a reasonable or educated doubt as to the [appropriate] medical course to [have] follow[ed].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Once again, we must disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As appellants failed to object to the burden-of-proof instructions before the jury retired to deliberate, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 51, we review for plain error.   See Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., 69 F.3d 1205, 1213 (1st Cir.1995).   Even though there may be a threshold beyond which further repetition of an otherwise proper jury instruction creates an unacceptable risk that the jury will be misled, see Davet v. Maccarone, 973 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir.1992), appellants do not approach such a showing by citing three brief references to the burden of proof in the eleven-page jury charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, though plaintiffs asserted a contemporaneous objection to the \"multiple\" error-in-judgment instructions, there was no error.   A correct understanding of the error-in-judgment principle, the seminal legal concept defining the duty of care incumbent upon physicians under Puerto Rico medical malpractice law, was vital to a proper jury verdict.   Moreover, the trial court's error-in-judgment instructions, individually and in combination, were neither suggestive nor prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellants claim that the district court erred in denying their motion for new trial.   See Fed.R.Civ.P. 59.   Plaintiffs' independent expert, Dr. Brown, testified that Drs. Rivera and Martinez were negligent in failing to record Fernandez' past medical history on the hospital charts;  and in failing to diagnose the aortal dissection on November 4, based on the complaints of earlier chest pain, and the chest x-ray disclosing aortal dilation.   Appellants argue that the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence because the duty of care in a malpractice action can only be proven through expert medical testimony;  their expert, Dr. Brown, was the only independent medical expert to testify at trial;  and the self-serving, biased testimony by the defendant-physicians themselves concerning their own duties of care was inherently untrustworthy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Rule 59 ruling, denying a motion for new trial based on an alleged insufficiency of evidence, is reviewed for abuse of discretion.   See Lama v. Borras, 16 F.3d 473, 477 (1st Cir.1994).   A new trial should be granted only if the verdict, though rationally based on the evidence, \"was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"  Id.  But where there is substantial evidence to support the verdict, it is \" 'only in a very unusual case' \" that denial of a Rule 59 motion will be ruled an abuse of discretion.  Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987) (citation omitted).   This is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, plaintiffs had to establish:  (1) the basic norms of knowledge and medical care applicable to general practitioners or specialists;  (2) that the defendant-physicians did not meet these basic norms in their treatment of Fernandez;  and (3) a causal relation between the defendants' acts or omissions, and Fernandez' death.   See Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 77 n. 2 (1st Cir.1993).   Although jurors rarely are able to determine the applicable standard of medical care without the benefit of expert testimony, under Puerto Rico law \"there exists always a presumption that the treating physicians have observed a reasonable degree of care ... in the process of giving medical attention and treatment.  [And] [p]laintiff bears the burden of refuting this presumption.\"  Id. at 78 (emphasis added).   Thus, appellants' premise--that malpractice defendants must invariably introduce independent expert testimony on the applicable duty of care--is flawed.   Although defendant-physicians often do adduce independent expert testimony on the applicable standard of medical care, the jury's implicit rejection of Dr. Brown's testimony in this case was itself sufficient to support a verdict for defendants because of the rebuttable presumption of due care indulged under Puerto Rico law, see id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was not compelled to credit Dr. Brown's testimony.  \"While not allowed to speculate, the factfinder is of course free to find some experts more credible than others.\"  Lama, 16 F.3d at 478.

On appeal, plaintiffs challenge several trial court rulings, including the denial of their motion for new trial.   We affirm the district court judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p>* BACKGROUND</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 4, 1991, Hiram Fernandez was taken to the emergency room of Federico Trilla Hospital in Carolina, Puerto Rico, after awakening with chest pains, severe leg cramps, and vomiting.   The 64-year-old Fernandez informed Dr. Pedro Rivera Bermudez (\"Dr. Rivera\") that the chest pain had stopped after he vomited, but the severe leg pain had not abated.   Fernandez failed to tell Dr. Rivera that he was taking medication for both asthma and hypertension.   Since Fernandez did not complain of recurring chest pain, and his vital statistics were within normal or borderline range, Dr. Rivera tentatively diagnosed a pinched nerve but nonetheless ordered an electrocardiogram (EKG), a urinalysis, and an x-ray of the lumbosacral region and the left leg.   All tests were negative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few hours later, Dr. Rivera was relieved in the emergency room by Dr. Ricardo Martinez Cortinez (\"Dr. Martinez\") whose examination confirmed that Fernandez was in stable condition, with no complaints of chest pain.   As a blood test showed a slightly elevated white blood count, Dr. Martinez ordered a second urinalysis, as well as a chest x-ray, to rule out any urinary or pulmonary infection which might have been caused by the vomiting.   The chest x-ray coincidently revealed that Fernandez had a dilated aorta, which Dr. Martinez attributed to normal borderline hypertension in a patient of Fernandez' age, rather than an emergent symptom of aortal dissection, a condition usually accompanied by excruciating and unrelenting chest pain, fainting spells, profuse sweating, and tachycardia.   Like Dr. Rivera, Dr. Martinez diagnosed a pinched nerve.   Shortly thereafter Dr. Martinez referred Fernandez to a neuropathic specialist, and discharged him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day, when Fernandez was unable to recognize family members, he was taken to his personal physician, Dr. Abelardo Vargas, who performed a physical examination and another EKG (also negative), and ordered an upper gastrointestinal series to determine whether there was a hiatal hernia.   The next day, on his way to undergo these tests, Fernandez collapsed and died.   An autopsy revealed the cause of death as a dissected aorta, a condition treatable with surgery in more than 90% of cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The decedent's spouse, children, and grandchildren filed a medical malpractice suit in federal district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332 (diversity jurisdiction) against Drs. Rivera, Martinez, and Vargas, and against various insurers of the Federico Trilla Hospital, including Global Insurance Company.   Subsequently, Dr. Vargas was dismissed as a party defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Dr. William T. Brown, a Miami-based cardiac specialist, provided expert testimony in behalf of plaintiffs on the applicable duty of care.   Drs. Rivera and Martinez testified in their own defense, but presented no independent medical testimony.   After the jury returned a verdict for all defendants, plaintiffs unsuccessfully filed a motion for new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59, then brought this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge four trial court rulings.   First, they focus on the denial of their request for rebuttal to the closing argument made by the defense.   Although trial court rulings on the conduct, timing, and ordering of closing arguments are reviewed only for abuse of discretion, see Bonilla v. Yamaha Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577014\"><a href=\"/opinion/577014/jorge-l-bonilla-v-yamaha-motors-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span>, 155 (1st Cir.1992);  see also United States v.

See Martin v. Chesebrough-Pond's, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"374080\"><a href=\"/opinion/374080/lori-byrd-martin-v-chesebrough-ponds-inc-defendant-third-party-foster/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">498</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1980) (noting that \"[n]ormally the party with the burden of proof has the right to open and close,\" but holding that a particular codefendant had no right to rebuttal as against another codefendant where the two had asserted mutual cross-claims).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants are mistaken.   The Martin court did not describe a civil-action plaintiff's \"right\" to rebuttal as absolute, but merely reconfirmed that the decision to permit rebuttal is a procedural matter which rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge, id. at 501, and rarely (if ever) provides fertile ground for appeal.

Defense counsel argued to the jury that Dr. Vargas, the decedent's long-time personal physician, was the one most likely to have been negligent since he was the last to treat Fernandez, and more familiar with his medical history.   Defense counsel further argued that Dr. Vargas, like the defendant-physicians, had not suspected that the Fernandez symptoms indicated an incipient aortal dissection but rather a hiatal hernia.   Appellants therefore contend that they were entitled to remind the jury in rebuttal that:  (1) the defendants had the right to implead Dr. Vargas if they believed he was the only negligent party and the sole proximate cause of Fernandez' death, and (2) Dr. Vargas had not treated Fernandez in a hospital;  thus, unlike defendants, could not as readily have obtained a chest x-ray.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As plaintiffs failed to challenge the statements made by defense counsel in closing argument, we review only for plain error.   See Johnson v. National Sea Prods., Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"678494\"><a href=\"/opinion/678494/michael-johnson-v-national-sea-products-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span>, 631 (1st Cir.1994).   The statements made by the defense in closing were in no sense inflammatory, but rather a measured response to earlier observations by plaintiffs' counsel that \"Dr. Vargas [is not] responsible for anything here simply because he did not have the x-rays that these defendants had the benefit of having because he was not in a position of having a full clinical picture.\"   Indeed, plaintiffs not only invited the defense response they now claim gave rise to a vital need for rebuttal,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but their invitation was itself a sufficient \"reminder\" to the jury that plaintiffs had adduced evidence that Dr. Vargas did not treat Fernandez in a hospital setting where x-rays were readily obtainable.   Thus, the district court ruling was well within its sound discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, though Fed.R.Civ.P. 14(a) permits defendants to implead a joint tortfeasor, see also Reyes-Lopez v. Misener Marine Constr.  Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510216\"><a href=\"/opinion/510216/felix-manuel-reyes-lopez-v-misener-marine-construction-co-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">854</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span>, 535 n. 23 (1st Cir.1988) (citing to Puerto Rico case law allowing joint-tortfeasor contribution), Rule 14 is not mandatory.   Appellants do not cite, nor have we found, any authority for the proposition that a jury must be permitted to draw an adverse inference from a defendant's decision to forego a Rule 14 impleader.   We therefore conclude that there was no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, appellants claim that it was an abuse of discretion to refuse their timely request to instruct the jury that defendants could have impleaded Dr. Vargas.   For the reasons discussed above, we find no abuse of discretion.   See Makuc v. American Honda Motor Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498702\"><a href=\"/opinion/498702/anne-m-makuc-v-american-honda-motor-company-inc-john-d-makuc/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 393 n. 1 (1st Cir.1987) (noting that proponent must cite to some legal authority which would support its proposed jury instruction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, appellants contend that over-repetition of the district court's unexceptionable jury instruction--that plaintiffs must establish all elements of their negligence claims--constituted reversible error because it exaggerated the burden of proof in the minds of the jury.   See United States v. Assi, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444359\"><a href=\"/opinion/444359/united-states-v-fathi-assi-aka-karlet-and-judith-charres/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 66 (2d Cir.1984).   Similar reversible error arose, plaintiffs say, from the district court's over-repetition of its \"error in judgment\" instruction, viz., that a physician is not liable under Puerto Rico law for a faulty diagnosis or failure to treat if there existed \"a reasonable or educated doubt as to the [appropriate] medical course to [have] follow[ed].\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Once again, we must disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As appellants failed to object to the burden-of-proof instructions before the jury retired to deliberate, see Fed.R.Civ.P. 51, we review for plain error.   See Kerr-Selgas v. American Airlines, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707599\"><a href=\"/opinion/707599/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-944-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43780-mary-jane/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span>, 1213 (1st Cir.1995).   Even though there may be a threshold beyond which further repetition of an otherwise proper jury instruction creates an unacceptable risk that the jury will be misled, see Davet v. Maccarone, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589645\"><a href=\"/opinion/589645/richard-f-davet-v-enrico-maccarone/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1992), appellants do not approach such a showing by citing three brief references to the burden of proof in the eleven-page jury charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, though plaintiffs asserted a contemporaneous objection to the \"multiple\" error-in-judgment instructions, there was no error.   A correct understanding of the error-in-judgment principle, the seminal legal concept defining the duty of care incumbent upon physicians under Puerto Rico medical malpractice law, was vital to a proper jury verdict.   Moreover, the trial court's error-in-judgment instructions, individually and in combination, were neither suggestive nor prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellants claim that the district court erred in denying their motion for new trial.   See Fed.R.Civ.P. 59.   Plaintiffs' independent expert, Dr. Brown, testified that Drs. Rivera and Martinez were negligent in failing to record Fernandez' past medical history on the hospital charts;  and in failing to diagnose the aortal dissection on November 4, based on the complaints of earlier chest pain, and the chest x-ray disclosing aortal dilation.   Appellants argue that the jury verdict was against the weight of the evidence because the duty of care in a malpractice action can only be proven through expert medical testimony;  their expert, Dr. Brown, was the only independent medical expert to testify at trial;  and the self-serving, biased testimony by the defendant-physicians themselves concerning their own duties of care was inherently untrustworthy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Rule 59 ruling, denying a motion for new trial based on an alleged insufficiency of evidence, is reviewed for abuse of discretion.   See Lama v. Borras, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195226\"><a href=\"/opinion/195226/lama-romero-v-asociacion/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 477 (1st Cir.1994).   A new trial should be granted only if the verdict, though rationally based on the evidence, \"was so clearly against the weight of the evidence as to amount to a manifest miscarriage of justice.\"  Id.  But where there is substantial evidence to support the verdict, it is \" 'only in a very unusual case' \" that denial of a Rule 59 motion will be ruled an abuse of discretion.  Wagenmann v. Adams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 200 (1st Cir.1987) (citation omitted).   This is not such a case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, plaintiffs had to establish:  (1) the basic norms of knowledge and medical care applicable to general practitioners or specialists;  (2) that the defendant-physicians did not meet these basic norms in their treatment of Fernandez;  and (3) a causal relation between the defendants' acts or omissions, and Fernandez' death.   See Rolon-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194861\"><a href=\"/opinion/194861/rolon-alvarado-v-municipality-of-sj/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 77 n. 2 (1st Cir.1993).   Although jurors rarely are able to determine the applicable standard of medical care without the benefit of expert testimony, under Puerto Rico law \"there exists always a presumption that the treating physicians have observed a reasonable degree of care ... in the process of giving medical attention and treatment.  [And] [p]laintiff bears the burden of refuting this presumption.\"  Id. at 78 (emphasis added).   Thus, appellants' premise--that malpractice defendants must invariably introduce independent expert testimony on the applicable duty of care--is flawed.   Although defendant-physicians often do adduce independent expert testimony on the applicable standard of medical care, the jury's implicit rejection of Dr. Brown's testimony in this case was itself sufficient to support a verdict for defendants because of the rebuttable presumption of due care indulged under Puerto Rico law, see id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury was not compelled to credit Dr. Brown's testimony.  \"While not allowed to speculate, the factfinder is of course free to find some experts more credible than others.\"  Lama, 16 F.3d at 478.   On cross-examination, Dr. Brown admitted that he was not able to read or speak Spanish fluently, that he had not been provided initially with certified English translations of the hospital and medical records relating to Fernandez, and that until shortly before trial he had relied on informal translations--whose accuracy was seriously disputed at trial--prepared by his secretary and plaintiffs' counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Given the infirmities in the only expert testimony presented by plaintiffs, there was no abuse of discretion in denying a new trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court judgment is affirmed.   Costs are awarded to appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In fact, defense counsel expressly noted in closing argument:  \"This is the same Dr. Abelardo Vargas and I refer to this because brother counsel did refer to it [in his closing].\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Appellants also argue that no \"error-in-judgment\" instruction was appropriate because defendants failed to adduce expert medical testimony to support a jury finding that \"a reasonable or educated doubt\" existed.   But see infra pp. 211-12</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> For example, the hospital records stated that Fernandez had vomited before arriving at the hospital, and that this \"ended\" his chest pain, while the informal translations relied on by Dr. Brown merely indicated that the chest pain had \"improved.\"   In addition, presented with a medical treatise describing typical symptoms of an impending aortal dissection, Dr. Brown's only response was the unexplicated assertion that he simply did not care what the medical treatise provided</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> As concerns the contention by Dr. Brown that the defendant-physicians were negligent in failing to record Fernandez' medical history on the medical charts, the jury was entitled to credit the defendant-physicians' testimony that they left the \"medical history\" section of the hospital record blank because Fernandez informed them (inaccurately) that he had no significant medical history.
