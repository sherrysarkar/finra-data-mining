PETRICCA,\r\n\n               Defendant, Appellee.\r\n\n   APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n         FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n   [Hon. Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                      Before\r\n\n              Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n            Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n        and Pollak, Senior District Judge.\r\n\nChase A. Caro, with whom Caro &amp; Associates, P.C., Thomas J. Butters\r\nand Butters, Brazilian &amp; Small, LLP were on brief for appellant.\r\nKathryn W. Kyle, with whom Michael E. MacDonald and Cain, Hibbard,\r\nMyers &amp; Cook, P.C. were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                   July 7, 1999\r\n\nCYR, Senior Circuit Judge.  On December 18, 1997, an\r\narbitration panel convened by the National Association of\r\nSecurities Dealers (NASD) ordered appellant Salvatore A. Fradella\r\nto pay appellee Richard T. Petricca $25,000 in compensatory\r\ndamages.  In subscribing the award the arbitrators purported to act\r\npursuant to New York law.  One month later Fradella's attorney\r\nwrote to NASD counsel, advising that the December 18 award was\r\n\"imperfect as to form,\" in that \"it should reflect that the\r\n[arbitrators'] decision was made in accordance with Massachusetts,\r\nnot New York, practice.\"   \r\nOn February 23, NASD counsel sent Fradella revised\r\nsignature pages, which deleted the earlier references to New York\r\nlaw but continued to reflect the date of the arbitral award as\r\nDecember 18, 1997.  Thereafter, Fradella's attorney again wrote to\r\nNASD counsel, advising that the date of the \"final\" arbitral award\r\nshould be February 23, 1998, rather than December 18, 1997.  On\r\nFebruary 27, NASD counsel notified Fradella that the earlier date\r\nremained in effect, and that Fradella should refer to it in any\r\nmotion to vacate the award.\r\nFradella moved to vacate the award on March 25, 1998. \r\nSee Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C.  10(a).  Petricca\r\nresponded by moving for summary judgment on the ground that the\r\nmotion to vacate was seven days late.  See id.  12 (\"Notice of a\r\nmotion to vacate, modify, or correct an award must be served upon\r\nthe adverse party or his attorney within three months after the\r\naward is filed or delivered.\").  The district court entered summary\r\njudgment for Petricca after determining that the December 18\r\narbitral award was \"final\" because it had resolved all claims\r\nsubmitted in the demand for arbitration, and the arbitrators'\r\nsubsequent correction of the award as to mere  \"ministerial\" or\r\n\"uncontroversial\" details (i.e., the ambiguity concerning choice of\r\nlaw) did not impede the finality of the December 18 award.\r\nOn appeal, Fradella first contends that the December 18\r\naward did not become final for FAA  12 purposes, because, contrary\r\nto the district court's characterization, the arbitrators' February\r\n23 amendment was both substantive and substantial, rather than\r\n\"ministerial.\"  We do not agree.\r\nThe primary purpose served by the arbitration process is\r\nexpeditious dispute resolution.  See United Paperworkers Int'l\r\nUnion, AFL-CIO v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987). \r\nConsequently, somewhat different standards govern the finality of\r\njudgments and arbitral awards.  See Dreis &amp; Krump Mfg. Co. v.\r\nInternational Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 802 F.2d\r\n247, 251 (7th Cir. 1986).   Normally, an arbitral award is deemed\r\n\"final\" provided it evidences the arbitrators' intention to resolve\r\nall claims submitted in the demand for arbitration, even though the\r\narbitrators purport to retain jurisdiction in the event the need\r\narises to resolve some subsidiary matter, such as damages or\r\nbackpay calculations.  See, e.g., id. (noting that unresolved\r\ncalculation of \"the precise amount of backpay . . . was, therefore,\r\na 'ministerial' detail, such as would not have prevented the\r\n[award] from being deemed final\").  Accordingly, under the\r\napplicable finality standard, the arbitral award to Petricca\r\nunquestionably became \"final\" on December 18, since it\r\nunambiguously determined that Fradella owed Petricca $25,000 on the\r\nsecurities claim and Fradella does not contend that it left any\r\nother \"claim\" unresolved.\r\nThe one remaining question is whether either the\r\nerroneous signature page and/or its subsequent amendment on\r\nFebruary 23 cast doubt upon the arbitrators' intention that the\r\nDecember 18 award resolved all \"claims\" submitted to arbitration. \r\nSince the choice-of-law issue itself in no sense constituted an\r\narbitrable \"claim,\" as distinguished from a subsidiary\r\ndetermination regarding the legal regimen under which the\r\nsecurities \"claim\" was to be decided, we conclude that the December\r\n18 arbitral award finally resolved the only \"claim\" Petricca\r\nsubmitted to arbitration   i.e., the securities claim   because\r\nthere is no suggestion that any counterclaim or affirmative defense\r\nremained undecided.\r\nIn all events the finality vel non of the arbitral award\r\nitself could not have been affected by any mistaken indication as\r\nto the governing law.  Were such alleged subsidiary \"mistakes\"\r\nsufficient to divest an arbitral award of its finality, the running\r\nof the limitations period prescribed in FAA  12 could be postponed\r\nor suspended indefinitely.  In the process, the \"finality\" test\r\napplicable to arbitral awards would be severely undermined, along\r\nwith the central purpose served by arbitration proceedings.\r\nThat is to say, if the limitations period prescribed in\r\nFAA  12 were subject to suspension simply because an arbitral\r\naward contained error, even though the arbitrators had intended to\r\nresolve all submitted \"claims,\" an unsuccessful party could\r\npreclude the commencement   or suspend the running   of the\r\nlimitations period simply by alleging subsidiary errors in their\r\nFAA  10 motions to vacate an adverse arbitral award. Thus, the\r\ncontention that mere error   whether ministerial, procedural or\r\nsubstantive   renders an arbitral award non-\"final\" is fatally\r\nflawed.\r\nAs the present appeal demonstrates, see supra note 3, the\r\nfinality standard suggested by Fradella would immerse reviewing\r\ncourts in highly subjective, ad hoc assessments as to which\r\narbitral errors are sufficiently \"important\" to preclude or suspend\r\nthe running of the limitations period under FAA  12.  Clearly,\r\nhowever, the parties to arbitration proceedings need reliable\r\nguidelines to enable timely compliance with the FAA  12\r\nlimitations period.  See International Ass'n of Bridge, Structural\r\nand Ornamental Iron Workers v. Burtman Iron Works, Inc., 928 F.\r\nSupp. 83, 89 (D. Mass. 1996)(\"[T]he court is unpersuaded that the\r\ndistinction between ministerial tasks and significant issues\r\nprovides a sufficiently clear guide for determining whether a\r\nvacatur action has accrued.\").  It is not surprising, therefore,\r\nthat Fradella cites no authority for the finality standard he\r\nadvocates, since it would run directly counter to the dominant\r\npolicy goal of the FAA:  promoting the expeditious and final\r\nresolution of arbitral claims.  As the arbitrators plainly\r\nintended, their December 18 award resolved the securities claim\r\nsubmitted against Fradella, and the three-month limitations period\r\ncommenced running immediately upon entry of the arbitral award.\r\nNext, Fradella argues that even if the award became\r\n\"final\" upon entry, federal law conclusively establishes that an\r\napplication to modify or clarify an arbitral award tolls the FAA \r\n12 limitations period.  We reject this contention as well, since\r\nthe authorities cited in support are clearly inapposite.\r\n\nFinally, Fradella suggests that the filing deadline in\r\nFAA  12 is subject to equitable or \"due diligence\" tolling. \r\nNormally, a statutory limitations period is tolled only if, for\r\nexample, extraordinary circumstances beyond the claimant's control\r\nprevented timely filing, or the claimant was materially misled into\r\nmissing the deadline.  See, e.g., Alvarez-Machain v. United States,\r\n107 F.3d 696, 701 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 60\r\n(1997).  We need not consider whether the deadline prescribed in\r\nFAA  12 is subject to such equitable tolling, since Fradella has\r\nnot generated a trialworthy issue as to his entitlement to invoke\r\ntolling.\r\nFradella was not victimized by fate or wile.  No\r\nstatutory or judicial authority supported his contention that the\r\nDecember 18 award was other than \"final,\" nor that his application\r\nto correct the award tolled the FAA  12 limitations period.  See,\r\ne.g., International Ass'n, 928 F. Supp. at 86-87 (\"Nor does a party\r\nmoving for reconsideration of an arbitration award toll the running\r\nof the limitations period.\") (citing Dreis); supra note 4.  Rather,\r\nin the application to correct the arbitral award, Fradella directly\r\nstated that the December 18 award was \"imperfect as to form,\" and\r\nflatly conceded that the arbitrators had in fact applied\r\nMassachusetts law (i.e., \"the [arbitrators'] decision was made in\r\naccordance with Massachusetts, not New York, practice\").  (Emphasis\r\nadded.)   Moreover, in a February 27, 1998 letter, NASD counsel\r\nexplicitly alerted Fradella's counsel that the official date of the\r\narbitral award remained December 18, 1997, notwithstanding its\r\nsubsequent correction on February 23, and that Fradella \"should\r\nrefer to the earlier date when [filing his] Motion to Vacate.\" \r\nThus, neither the NASD nor Petricca misled Fradella in any\r\nrespect.  The decision to delay the motion to vacate was made by\r\nFradella.\r\nAFFIRMED; costs to defendant-appellee.\n",

Furthermore, Fradella neither suggests that Massachusetts and New York respondeat superior principles differ, nor that any choice-of-law issue would have been dispositive of the securities claim itself. Instead, Fradella conceded that the error was one of \"form,\" see supra, and that the arbitrators had applied Massachusetts law in the first instance.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In re Warner-Chappell Music, Inc., 638 N.Y.S.2d 35, 35 (App. Div. 1996), interpreted the New York Arbitration Act, see N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7509, 7510, 7511. Unlike the FAA, both the New York Arbitration Act and the Uniform Arbitration Act (&#167; 9) expressly authorize the parties to apply to the arbitrators for modification within twenty days after an arbitral award. Based on the legislative history of the New York Arbitration Act, the courts have held that the legislature intended that the limitations period for filing a motion to vacate an award commence upon entry of an arbitral order disposing of such a post-award application, rather than upon entry of the original award. See In re Belli, 263 N.Y.S.2d 846, 848 (1965) (per curiam), cited in Warner-Chappell, 638 N.Y.S.2d at 302; see also In re Harry Hoffman Printing, Inc., 912 F.2d 608, 614 (2d Cir. 1990) (applying Belli); cf. also Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) (tolling appeal period pending federal district court's disposition of postjudgment motion for reconsideration).</p>\n        <p>There is no comparable FAA provision. The only specified recourse for an aggrieved party under the FAA is to file a motion to vacate or modify the award in the district court, see 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(4) (The court \"may make an order vacating the award . . . (4) [w]here the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\"), which can only remand an ambiguous arbitral award for clarification. See Olympia &amp; York Fla. Equity Corp. v. Gould, 776 F.2d 42, 45 (2d Cir. 1985). This vital distinction between the FAA, on the one hand, and the New York Arbitration Act and Fed. R.

Lanier involved a motion to remand filed in the district court as an alternative to a FAA &#167; 10 motion to vacate, and although the court noted that the time for filing a motion to vacate may have lapsed, FAA &#167; 12 by its express terms does not apply to remand motions. See id. at 843. Importantly, the court did not hold that the remand motion tolled the deadline under FAA &#167; 12. By contrast, Fradella filed no remand motion with the district court. Nor is the timeliness of Fradella's application to correct the arbitral award a matter at issue. The only issue is whether the application he filed with the arbitrators to correct the December 18 award tolled the FAA &#167; 12 limitations period, an issue on which Lanier is silent.</p>\n        <p>Fradella cites Taylor v.

Instead, it simply noted that the aggrieved party had not filed a motion to vacate within three months of either the initial arbitral award or the clarifying arbitral decision entered after the court-ordered remand. Given so complete a waiver, there was no need for the Fourth Circuit to consider whether a motion to vacate filed within three months of the clarifying order would have been timely, even assuming the appellee had filed no previous motion to vacate within three months of the original arbitral decision.

Fradella to pay appellee Richard T. Petricca $25,000 in compensatory damages. In subscribing the award the arbitrators purported to act pursuant to New York law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> One month later Fradella's attorney wrote to NASD counsel, advising that the December 18 award was \"imperfect as to form,\" in that \"it should reflect that the [arbitrators'] decision was made in accordance with Massachusetts, not New York, practice.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 23, NASD counsel sent Fradella revised signature pages, which deleted the earlier references to New York law but continued to reflect the date of the arbitral award as December 18, 1997. Thereafter, Fradella's attorney again wrote to NASD counsel, advising that the date of the \"final\" arbitral award should be February 23, 1998, rather than December 18, 1997. On February 27, NASD counsel notified Fradella that the earlier date remained in effect, and that Fradella should refer to it in any motion to vacate the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fradella moved to vacate the award on March 25, 1998. See Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a). Petricca responded by moving for summary judgment on the ground that the motion to vacate was seven days late. See id. &#167; 12 (\"Notice of a motion to vacate, modify, or correct an award must be served upon the adverse party or his attorney within three months after the award is filed or delivered.\"). The district court entered summary judgment for Petricca after determining that the December 18 arbitral award was \"final\" because it had resolved all claims submitted in the demand for arbitration, and the arbitrators' subsequent correction of the award as to mere \"ministerial\" or \"uncontroversial\" details (i.e., the ambiguity concerning choice of law) did not impede the finality of the December 18 award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Fradella first contends that the December 18 award did not become final for FAA &#167; 12 purposes, because, contrary to the district court's characterization, the arbitrators' February 23 amendment was both substantive and substantial, rather than \"ministerial.\" We do not agree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The primary purpose served by the arbitration process is expeditious dispute resolution. See United Paperworkers Int'l Union, AFL-CIO v. Misco, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111965\"><a href=\"/opinion/111965/paperworkers-v-misco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 38 (1987). Consequently, somewhat different standards govern the finality of judgments and arbitral awards. See Dreis &amp; Krump Mfg. Co. v. International Ass'n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476876\"><a href=\"/opinion/476876/dreis-krump-manufacturing-company-plaintiff-counterdefendant-appellant-/\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span>, 251 (7th Cir. 1986). Normally, an arbitral award is deemed \"final\" provided it evidences the arbitrators' intention to resolve all claims submitted in the demand for arbitration, even though the arbitrators purport to retain jurisdiction in the event the need arises to resolve some subsidiary matter, such as damages or backpay calculations. See, e.g., id. (noting that unresolved calculation of \"the precise amount of backpay . . . was, therefore, a 'ministerial' detail, such as would not have prevented the [award] from being deemed final\"). Accordingly, under the applicable finality standard, the arbitral award to Petricca unquestionably became \"final\" on December 18, since it unambiguously determined that Fradella owed Petricca $25,000 on the securities claim and Fradella does not contend that it left any other \"claim\" unresolved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The one remaining question is whether either the erroneous signature page and/or its subsequent amendment on February 23 cast doubt upon the arbitrators' intention that the December 18 award resolved all \"claims\" submitted to arbitration. Since the choice-of-law issue itself in no sense constituted an arbitrable \"claim,\" as distinguished from a subsidiary determination regarding the legal regimen under which the securities \"claim\" was to be decided, we conclude that the December 18 arbitral award finally resolved the only \"claim\" Petricca submitted to arbitration -- i.e., the securities claim -- because there is no suggestion that any counterclaim or affirmative defense remained undecided.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events the finality vel non of the arbitral award itself could not have been affected by any mistaken indication as to the governing law. Were such alleged subsidiary \"mistakes\" sufficient to divest an arbitral award of its finality, the running of the limitations period prescribed in FAA &#167; 12 could be postponed or suspended indefinitely. In the process, the \"finality\" test applicable to arbitral awards would be severely undermined, along with the central purpose served by arbitration proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is to say, if the limitations period prescribed in FAA &#167; 12 were subject to suspension simply because an arbitral award contained error, even though the arbitrators had intended to resolve all submitted \"claims,\" an unsuccessful party could preclude the commencement -- or suspend the running -- of the limitations period simply by alleging subsidiary errors in their FAA &#167; 10 motions to vacate an adverse arbitral award. Thus, the contention that mere error -- whether ministerial, procedural or substantive -- renders an arbitral award non-\"final\" is fatally flawed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the present appeal demonstrates, see supra note 3, the finality standard suggested by Fradella would immerse reviewing courts in highly subjective, ad hoc assessments as to which arbitral errors are sufficiently \"important\" to preclude or suspend the running of the limitations period under FAA &#167; 12. Clearly, however, the parties to arbitration proceedings need reliable guidelines to enable timely compliance with the FAA &#167; 12 limitations period. See International Ass'n of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers v. Burtman Iron Works, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1446831\"><a href=\"/opinion/1446831/intern-assn-iron-workers-v-burtman-iron-works/\"><span class=\"volume\">928</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 89 (D. Mass. 1996)(\"[T]he court is unpersuaded that the distinction between ministerial tasks and significant issues provides a sufficiently clear guide for determining whether a vacatur action has accrued.\"). It is not surprising, therefore, that Fradella cites no authority for the finality standard he advocates, since it would run directly counter to the dominant policy goal of the FAA: promoting the expeditious and final resolution of arbitral claims. As the arbitrators plainly intended, their December 18 award resolved the securities claim submitted against Fradella, and the three-month limitations period commenced running immediately upon entry of the arbitral award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Fradella argues that even if the award became \"final\" upon entry, federal law conclusively establishes that an application to modify or clarify an arbitral award tolls the FAA &#167; 12 limitations period. We reject this contention as well, since the authorities cited in support are clearly inapposite.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Fradella suggests that the filing deadline in FAA &#167; 12 is subject to equitable or \"due diligence\" tolling. Normally, a statutory limitations period is tolled only if, for example, extraordinary circumstances beyond the claimant's control prevented timely filing, or the claimant was materially misled into missing the deadline. See, e.g., Alvarez-Machain v. United States, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></span>, 701 (9th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></span> (1997). We need not consider whether the deadline prescribed in FAA &#167; 12 is subject to such equitable tolling, since Fradella has not generated a trialworthy issue as to his entitlement to invoke tolling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fradella was not victimized by fate or wile. No statutory or judicial authority supported his contention that the December 18 award was other than \"final,\" nor that his application to correct the award tolled the FAA &#167; 12 limitations period. See, e.g., International Ass'n, 928 F. Supp. at 86-87 (\"Nor does a party moving for reconsideration of an arbitration award toll the running of the limitations period.\") (citing Dreis); supra note 4. Rather, in the application to correct the arbitral award, Fradella directly stated that the December 18 award was \"imperfect as to form,\" and flatly conceded that the arbitrators had in fact applied Massachusetts law (i.e., \"the [arbitrators'] decision was made in accordance with Massachusetts, not New York, practice\"). (Emphasis added.) Moreover, in a February 27, 1998 letter, NASD counsel explicitly alerted Fradella's counsel that the official date of the arbitral award remained December 18, 1997, notwithstanding its subsequent correction on February 23, and that Fradella \"should refer to the earlier date when [filing his] Motion to Vacate.\" Thus, neither the NASD nor Petricca misled Fradella in any respect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The decision to delay the motion to vacate was made by Fradella.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED; costs to defendant-appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The arbitrators' signatures appear below the following language: \"[the undersigned] hereby affirm, pursuant to Article 7505 of the New York Civil Practice Laws and Rules, that [we are] the individual[s] described herein, and who executed this instrument which is [our] decision in the above-referenced matter.\" Article 7505 invests arbitrators with the powers to issue subpoenas and administer oaths, which powers are conferred by the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure as well.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Treating the evidence in the light most favorable to Fradella, we review the summary judgment ruling de novo in order to determine whether there existed a triable issue of material fact or Petricca was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Brennan v. King, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197854\"><a href=\"/opinion/197854/brennan-v-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">139</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 262 (1st Cir. 1998). We review the district court's interpretation of the FAA de novo as well. See Strickland v. Commissioner, Me. Dep't of Human Servs., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196992\"><a href=\"/opinion/196992/strickland-v-comm-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 545 (1st Cir. 1996).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Simply as an aside, we note also that it is not possible to determine whether the arbitrators applied New York Law in their December 18 decision. The clause deleted on February 23 may have signified either that the arbitrators (1) mistakenly applied New York respondeat superior principles in resolving the securities claim in the first instance; (2) correctly applied Massachusetts respondeat superior principles to the merits of the securities claim in the first instance, but merely treated New York procedural law as the source for their authority to issue subpoenas and administer oaths; or (3) decided the case under Massachusetts law only, but inadvertently included the reference to New York practice. Furthermore, Fradella neither suggests that Massachusetts and New York respondeat superior principles differ, nor that any choice-of-law issue would have been dispositive of the securities claim itself. Instead, Fradella conceded that the error was one of \"form,\" see supra, and that the arbitrators had applied Massachusetts law in the first instance.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> In re Warner-Chappell Music, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">638</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></span>, 35 (App. Div. 1996), interpreted the New York Arbitration Act, see N.Y. C.P.L.R. 7509, 7510, 7511. Unlike the FAA, both the New York Arbitration Act and the Uniform Arbitration Act (&#167; 9) expressly authorize the parties to apply to the arbitrators for modification within twenty days after an arbitral award. Based on the legislative history of the New York Arbitration Act, the courts have held that the legislature intended that the limitations period for filing a motion to vacate an award commence upon entry of an arbitral order disposing of such a post-award application, rather than upon entry of the original award. See In re Belli, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></span>, 848 (1965) (per curiam), cited in Warner-Chappell, 638 N.Y.S.2d at 302; see also In re Harry Hoffman Printing, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547211\"><a href=\"/opinion/547211/in-the-matter-of-an-arbitration-between-harry-hoffman-printing-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span>, 614 (2d Cir. 1990) (applying Belli); cf. also Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) (tolling appeal period pending federal district court's disposition of postjudgment motion for reconsideration).</p>\n        <p>There is no comparable FAA provision. The only specified recourse for an aggrieved party under the FAA is to file a motion to vacate or modify the award in the district court, see 9 U.S.C. &#167; 10(a)(4) (The court \"may make an order vacating the award . . . (4) [w]here the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\"), which can only remand an ambiguous arbitral award for clarification. See Olympia &amp; York Fla. Equity Corp. v. Gould, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460237\"><a href=\"/opinion/460237/olympia-york-florida-equity-corp-and-o-y-equity-corp-v-theodore-b/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span>, 45 (2d Cir. 1985). This vital distinction between the FAA, on the one hand, and the New York Arbitration Act and Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) on the other, clearly indicates that Congress never intended that FAA &#167; 12 be tolled by an application for reconsideration filed with the arbitrators. See, e.g., Dreis, 802 F.2d at 250.</p>\n        <p>Fradella cites Lanier v. Old Republic Ins.
