The court below thought not and entered summary\r\n\njudgment in favor of the noteholder.  We affirm.\r\n\nI.  A TALE OF TWO LETTERS\r          I.  A TALE OF TWO LETTERS\r\n\n          In  the  summer  of 1990,  defendant-appellant  John J.\r\n\nHayes, III, executed a promissory note for $150,000, secured by a\r\n\nmortgage  on  premises  owned by  a  real  estate  trust that  he\r\n\ncontrolled.1    The  lender  subsequently failed  and  plaintiff-\r\n\nappellee Cadle Company (C-Co.) acquired  the note (which was then\r\n\nin  arrears)  from  the  Federal  Deposit  Insurance  Corporation\r\n\n(FDIC).  Cecil C. Cadle (Cadle), C-Co.'s vice president, informed\r\n\nHayes  of the  transfer and  the parties  commenced negotiations.\r\n\nThe preliminary haggling is of no consequence because the parties\r\n\nreached an  agreement and reduced it  to writing.  Cadle  wrote a\r\n\nletter on February 2, 1993, which stated in pertinent part:\r\n\n               This will confirm our agreement that The\r\n          Cadle Company will delay the repayment period\r\n          of the  subject loan until  February 10, 1994\r\n          if we receive $80,000 by March 2, 1993.\r\n               The  Cadle  Company purchased  your loan\r\n          from the FDIC in liquidation  of Boston Trade\r\n          Bank and  has full  authority to release  the\r\n          lien on  the real  estate in return  for this\r\n          $80,000 payment.  We  hereby agree to release\r\n          the lien upon payment of the $80,000 by March\r\n          2, 1993.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1There is  some uncertainty  about whether Hayes  signed the\r\nnote personally  or  in his  capacity as  a trustee  of the  real\r\nestate trust.  The point is of purely academic interest, however,\r\nas  Hayes,  acting  for   himself,  also  executed  an  unlimited\r\nguaranty.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nThe appellant signed the letter the same day, thereby  indicating\r\n\nhis assent to the proposed terms.\r\n\n          On  March 3,  Landmark  Bank mailed  a  bank check  for\r\n\n$80,000 to C-Co.2   The accompanying transmittal letter, over the\r\n\nsignature of James Goodrich, a Landmark vice president, stated in\r\n\nits entirety:   \"Enclosed is  a check for  $80,000 to  satisfy in\r\n\nfull the loan you acquired from the FDIC between the Boston Trade\r\n\nBank and  John J. Hayes.  Please execute a release and forward it\r\n\nto me as soon  as possible.  Thank you very  much for your help.\"\r\n\nCadle endorsed and deposited the check and forwarded a release of\r\n\nthe  mortgage lien as previously  agreed.  Hayes  made no further\r\n\npayments.\r\n\n          In September 1994 C-Co.  sued Hayes and a co-guarantor,\r\n\nKevin O'Reilly, in federal district court, seeking to recover the\r\n\nbalance  due on  the promissory  note, plus accrued  interest and\r\n\ncollection costs.3  The  battle lines were quickly drawn:   Hayes\r\n\ninsisted that  the  $80,000 payment  had  satisfied in  full  his\r\n\nobligations  under the  note, whereas  C-Co. insisted  with equal\r\n\nadamance that the payment did no  more than comply with the terms\r\n\nof the February 2 letter agreement (which merely deferred, rather\r\n\nthan  canceled, the obligation to  pay the balance  due under the\r\n\nnote).\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Although this check was sent one day later than the outside\r\ndate specified  in the February 2 letter agreement, neither party\r\ncontends that this delay  matters and we deem any  discrepancy to\r\nbe waived.\r\n\n     3O'Reilly  is not a party  to this appeal  and we abjure any\r\nfurther reference to him.\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          To  make a  tedious tale  tolerably terse,  the parties\r\n\nagreed  to have a magistrate judge, rather than a district judge,\r\n\npreside over the case.  See 28 U.S.C.   636(c)(1) (1994); Fed. R.\r                                     \r\n\nCiv. P.  73(b).   Thereafter, C-Co.  moved for summary  judgment,\r\n\nproffering,  among other  supporting  documents, the  February  2\r\n\nletter agreement.   Hayes filed  an opposition and  an affidavit.\r\n\nWhen C-Co. produced  Goodrich's sworn statement  that he had  not\r\n\nnegotiated with either Hayes or Cadle about repayment of the loan\r\n\nand that he had not been  privy to any agreement that the $80,000\r\n\npayment  would   discharge  the   entire  debt,  Hayes   filed  a\r\n\nsupplemental affidavit.  The  magistrate reviewed these and other\r\n\nmaterials, discerned  no genuine issue of  material fact, granted\r\n\nC-Co.'s motion, and  entered judgment  for a sum  certain.   This\r\n\nappeal followed.\r\n\nII.  ANALYSIS\r          II.  ANALYSIS\r\n\n          This appeal  requires little more than  an inquiry into\r\n\nthe permutations of the summary judgment standard.  We begin with\r\n\nsome general  principles and  then move  to a  more case-specific\r\n\nappraisal.\r\n\n                                A.\r                                          A.\r                                            \r\n\n          At the summary judgment stage, the trial court examines\r\n\nthe  entire record \"in the light most flattering to the nonmovant\r\n\nand indulg[es] all reasonable  inferences in that party's favor.\"\r\n\nMaldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir.\r                                               \r\n\n1994).   Only if  the record, viewed  in that  manner and without\r\n\nregard to credibility determinations, reveals no genuine issue as\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nto any material  fact may the court enter  summary judgment.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nGreenburg v.

Once this showing has  been made, the\r\n\nburden shifts  to the nonmovant to  demonstrate, through specific\r\n\nfacts,  that   a  trialworthy   issue  remains.     See  National\r                                                                           \r\n\nAmusements, Inc. v.

For the same purpose, \"material\" facts\r\n\nare those which possess \"the capacity  to sway the outcome of the\r\n\nlitigation under  the applicable  law.\"  National  Amusements, 43\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 735.   Still,  establishing a genuine  issue of  material\r\n\nfact requires more than effusive rhetoric and optimistic surmise.\r\n\n\"If  the evidence [adduced in opposition to the motion] is merely\r\n\ncolorable, or  is not  significantly probative, summary  judgment\r\n\nmay be granted.\"  Anderson v. Liberty  Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242,\r                                                            \r\n\n249-50 (1986) (citations omitted).  In other words, the \"evidence\r\n\nillustrating  the  factual controversy  cannot be  conjectural or\r\n\nproblematic;  it must have substance  in the sense  that it limns\r\n\ndiffering versions of  the truth which a factfinder  must resolve\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nat an  ensuing trial.\"  Mack  v.

See Garside  v. Osco Drug, Inc.,  895 F.2d 46, 48  (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir. 1990).\r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r                                            \r\n\n          The  case   for   summary  judgment   is   simple   and\r\n\nstraightforward.    C-Co.  says  that  Hayes  owed  money on  the\r\n\npromissory  note;  that  it agreed  to  defer  a  portion of  the\r                                                       \r\n\nindebtedness and  release  a security  interest if  Hayes made  a\r\n\npartial  payment of $80,000; that the terms of this deferral were\r\n\ncommemorated in the  February 2 letter  agreement; and that,  the\r\n\nperiod  of the deferment having  elapsed, Hayes must  now pay the\r\n\nbalance due under the note.  Hayes does not deny the authenticity\r\n\nof the February 2 letter agreement4 but nonetheless contends that\r\n\na genuine issue of fact exists as to whether the  $80,000 payment\r\n\nwas  made  and  accepted  in  full  satisfaction  of  the  entire\r\n\nindebtedness.  We  think that the  purported \"proof\" which  Hayes\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4To be  sure, the appellant alludes vaguely to certain prior\r\nnegotiations, but these cannot influence our decision as any such\r\nnegotiations  were  clearly  superseded  by  the   execution  and\r\ndelivery of the letter  agreement.  See, e.g., Brennan  v. Carvel\r                                                                           \r\nCorp., 929 F.2d 801,  806 (1st Cir. 1991); Amerada  Hess Corp. v.\r                                                                        \r\nGarabedian, 617 N.E.2d 630, 634 (Mass. 1993).\r                    \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nhas  assembled to substantiate his position is of a caliber which\r\n\ncourts  regularly  have held  insufficient  to  defeat a  summary\r\n\njudgment motion.\r\n\n          On this record,  certain facts cannot be gainsaid:  the\r\n\npromissory note was validly executed,  it was not paid  according\r\n\nto its tenor, and its ownership was properly transferred to C-Co.\r\n\nThe February 2 letter  agreement commemorates the parties' mutual\r\n\nassent to  an alternative  payment arrangement and  that document\r\n\ncontains the signatures of both  parties   signatures which Hayes\r\n\ndoes  not allege  were  procured by  fraud, chicanery,  coercion,\r\n\nduress, or other untoward means.  That agreement, on its face, is\r\n\nclear and unambiguous.  Moreover, it reflects valid consideration\r\n\ngiven  and received.  It nowhere suggests that an $80,000 payment\r\n\nby  Hayes  will  discharge  the  indebtedness  in  full;  to  the\r\n\ncontrary,  it states quite plainly that the receipt of $80,000 on\r\n\nor  before a  day  certain  will  enable  the  obligor  to  defer\r\n\nrepayment of the  underlying debt for approximately one  year and\r\n\nwill bring about the immediate release of the mortgage lien which\r\n\nsecured the debt.\r\n\n          The  short of  it  is that,  by  presenting the  letter\r\n\nagreement in support of its motion for brevis  disposition, C-Co.\r                                                       \r\n\ndischarged its initial burden under Rule 56.  The question, then,\r\n\nis  whether  Hayes,  as  the  party  opposing  summary  judgment,\r\n\nsucceeded  in  adducing  specific  facts   demonstrating  that  a\r\n\ntrialworthy issue remains on some material fact.\r\n\n          Hayes  argues that there is  a genuine issue  as to the\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nnature  of the $80,000 payment.  But this argument comprises more\r\n\ncry than wool.   First, he labors to  create the impression  that\r\n\nthe  parties entered into a series of negotiations apart from the\r\n\nFebruary   2  letter  agreement,   and  that  these  negotiations\r\n\nculminated in  a  new understanding  that a  one-time payment  of\r\n\n$80,000 would discharge the  entire debt.  The problem  with this\r\n\napproach  is that it consists entirely of gauzy generalities:  in\r\n\nhis affidavits, Hayes does  not say when or how  this arrangement\r                                                         \r\n\nwas consummated.   Moreover, he does not  claim that he and Cadle\r\n\nentered into such an arrangement personally; indeed, he does  not\r\n\neven suggest that  the two of  them discussed  the matter at  all\r\n\nbetween February  2 and March  3.  He  does state that  Cadle and\r\n\nGoodrich  \"had numerous  conversations\" during February  of 1993,\r\n\nbut this statement   which  in all events is apparently based  on\r\n\nsomething less than personal  knowledge   proves nothing.   Hayes\r\n\nnowhere relates the details  of any such conversations,  nor does\r\n\nhe indicate  that Goodrich was  authorized to act as  an agent on\r\n\nhis behalf.  In the absence of specific facts, Hayes' innuendoes,\r\n\nheatedly denied by C-Co. and refuted by Goodrich, are  inadequate\r\n\nto block summary judgment.5   See, e.g., Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat 583; Vega  v.

General  Elec. Co., 950  F.2d 816, 825-26\r                                                    \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n          The appellant's ace in the hole, as he envisions it, is\r\n\nGoodrich's  transmittal  letter.   We  do not  believe  that this\r\n\ncommuniqu ,  repudiated by its  author, can trump  the February 2\r\n\nletter agreement.   After all,  Goodrich has signed  an affidavit\r\n\nflatly rejecting Hayes' interpretation of his (Goodrich's) letter\r\n\nand  asserting that he never negotiated any agreement with either\r\n\nparty as to the nature of the $80,000 payment.   Since Goodrich's\r\n\nMarch  3 epistle  lacks  any evidence  of  mutual assent  by  the\r\n\nparties,  and since the record does not otherwise supply any such\r\n\nevidence, the epistle cannot carry the day.6\r\n\n          To be sure,  Hayes states in the climactic paragraph of\r\n\nhis main affidavit that:\r\n\n          I  believe that  the Cadle  Company took  the\r                              \r\n          $80,000.00 from Landmark Bank under the terms\r\n          of an agreement between the Cadle Company and\r\n          the Bank that the $80,000.00 would constitute\r\n          payment in full of  all of the obligations of\r\n          the trust  and the guarantors under the terms\r\n          of the Note.  [Emphasis supplied.]\r\n\nHowever,  neither Cadle  nor Landmark  acknowledge that  any such\r\n\nagreement ever  existed.  Thus, Hayes'  contrary conclusion lacks\r\n\nforce.   Statements made upon information  and belief, as opposed\r\n\nto  personal knowledge, are not entitled to weight in the summary\r\n\njudgment balance.  See Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 117-18\r                                                     \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1990); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\r                                   \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6The  fact that  C-Co.  deposited the  $80,000 check  proves\r\nnothing,  as  that  action   was  entirely  consistent  with  the\r\nprovisions of the February 2 letter agreement.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n          In  sum, Hayes'  \"proof\" is  bereft of  any significant\r\n\nprobative value.   Consequently,  we agree  with the  lower court\r\n\nthat a  reasonable factfinder could  not conclude on  this record\r\n\nthat the clear and unambiguous agreement between the parties made\r\n\nin February 1993 had been varied thereafter.\r\n\n                                C.\r                                          C.\r                                            \r\n\n          Shifting  rhetorical gears, the appellant makes another\r\n\ntour around the track,  attempting to persuade us that  an accord\r\n\nand satisfaction  existed between the parties  which relieved him\r\n\nof  any further obligations under  the promissory note.   This is\r\n\nthe same old whine in a slightly different bottle.\r\n\n          Under  Massachusetts law,  an  accord and  satisfaction\r\n\nexists when:\r\n\n               (1)  []  there  has  arisen  between the\r\n          parties  a  bona  fide  dispute  as   to  the\r\n          existence  or  extent  of liability;  (2)  []\r\n          subsequent to the arising of that dispute the\r\n          parties entered into  an agreement under  the\r\n          terms  of which the dispute is compromised by\r\n          the payment by  one party of a sum  in excess\r\n          of  that  which he  admits  he  owed and  the\r\n          receipt by the  other party of a  sum less in\r\n          amount than he claims is due him, all for the\r\n          purpose of  settling the dispute;  and (3)  a\r\n          performance by the parties of that agreement.\r\n\nRust Eng'g Co. v. Lawrence Pumps, Inc., 401 F. Supp. 328, 333 (D.\r                                                \r\n\nMass.  1975).  The  evidence before us  shows as a  matter of law\r\n\nthat no accord and satisfaction transpired here.\r\n\n          In the first place, the record reveals no dispute as to\r\n\nthe extent of Hayes'  liability under the promissory note  at the\r\n\ntime  of this asserted accord; the amount of indebtedness was not\r\n\nthen  in question,  merely the  method by  which  repayment would\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\noccur.    In the  second place,  the  appellant has  proffered no\r\n\nsignificantly probative evidence    only Hayes' bare allegations,\r\n\nalready  considered and found wanting    that the parties entered\r\n\ninto the sort of  mutual agreement that could form  the basis for\r\n\nan accord and satisfaction.7  Massachusetts law is pellucid that,\r\n\nin the  absence of  convincing evidence  of  mutual assent,  mere\r\n\npartial payment of an existing debt does not constitute an accord\r\n\nand satisfaction.  See Emerson v. Deming, 23 N.E.2d 1016, 1018-19\r                                                  \r\n\n(Mass. 1939);  Lipson v.

A party  faced with a properly\r\n\ndocumented summary judgment motion should not be able to keep his\r\n\ncase on life support merely by hurling  conclusory allegations in\r\n\nthe  movant's direction.    So  it  is  here:    the  appellant's\r\n\nrhetorical flourishes are not  sufficiently probative to create a\r\n\ngenuine issue  of  material fact  concerning  the nature  of  the\r\n\n$80,000 payment.

The court below thought not and entered summary judgment in favor of the noteholder.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. A TALE OF TWO LETTERS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1990, defendant-appellant John J. Hayes, III, executed a promissory note for $150,000, secured by a mortgage on premises owned by a real estate trust that he controlled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The lender subsequently failed and plaintiff-appellee Cadle Company (C-Co.) acquired the note (which was then in arrears) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Cecil C. Cadle (Cadle), C-Co.'s vice president, informed Hayes of the transfer and the parties commenced negotiations.  The preliminary haggling is of no consequence because the parties reached an agreement and reduced it to writing.  Cadle wrote a letter on February 2, 1993, which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This will confirm our agreement that The Cadle Company will delay the repayment period of the subject loan until February 10, 1994 if we receive $80,000 by March 2, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cadle Company purchased your loan from the FDIC in liquidation of Boston Trade Bank and has full authority to release the lien on the real estate in return for this $80,000 payment.  We hereby agree to release the lien upon payment of the $80,000 by March 2, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant signed the letter the same day, thereby indicating his assent to the proposed terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 3, Landmark Bank mailed a bank check for $80,000 to C-Co.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The accompanying transmittal letter, over the signature of James Goodrich, a Landmark vice president, stated in its entirety:  \"Enclosed is a check for $80,000 to satisfy in full the loan you acquired from the FDIC between the Boston Trade Bank and John J. Hayes.  Please execute a release and forward it to me as soon as possible.  Thank you very much for your help.\"   Cadle endorsed and deposited the check and forwarded a release of the mortgage lien as previously agreed.  Hayes made no further payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1994 C-Co. sued Hayes and a co-guarantor, Kevin O'Reilly, in federal district court, seeking to recover the balance due on the promissory note, plus accrued interest and collection costs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The battle lines were quickly drawn:  Hayes insisted that the $80,000 payment had satisfied in full his obligations under the note, whereas C-Co. insisted with equal adamance that the payment did no more than comply with the terms of the February 2 letter agreement (which merely deferred, rather than canceled, the obligation to pay the balance due under the note).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, the parties agreed to have a magistrate judge, rather than a district judge, preside over the case.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(c)(1) (1994);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 73(b).  Thereafter, C-Co. moved for summary judgment, proffering, among other supporting documents, the February 2 letter agreement.  Hayes filed an opposition and an affidavit.  When C-Co. produced Goodrich's sworn statement that he had not negotiated with either Hayes or Cadle about repayment of the loan and that he had not been privy to any agreement that the $80,000 payment would discharge the entire debt, Hayes filed a supplemental affidavit.  The magistrate reviewed these and other materials, discerned no genuine issue of material fact, granted C-Co.'s motion, and entered judgment for a sum certain.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal requires little more than an inquiry into the permutations of the summary judgment standard.  We begin with some general principles and then move to a more case-specific appraisal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the summary judgment stage, the trial court examines the entire record \"in the light most flattering to the nonmovant and indulg[es] all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\"  Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 581 (1st Cir.1994).  Only if the record, viewed in that manner and without regard to credibility determinations, reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact may the court enter summary judgment.  See Greenburg v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth., 835 F.2d 932, 936 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The summary judgment machinery operates in two phases.  First, the movant must make a preliminary showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact which requires resolution in the crucible of a trial.  Once this showing has been made, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to demonstrate, through specific facts, that a trialworthy issue remains.  See National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.1995);  Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purpose of summary judgment, an issue of fact is \"genuine\" if it \"may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.\"  Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  For the same purpose, \"material\" facts are those which possess \"the capacity to sway the outcome of the litigation under the applicable law.\"  National Amusements, 43 F.3d at 735.   Still, establishing a genuine issue of material fact requires more than effusive rhetoric and optimistic surmise.  \"If the evidence [adduced in opposition to the motion] is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2511, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (citations omitted).  In other words, the \"evidence illustrating the factual controversy cannot be conjectural or problematic;  it must have substance in the sense that it limns differing versions of the truth which a factfinder must resolve at an ensuing trial.\"  Mack v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac.  Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 181 (1st Cir.1989).  \"[C]onclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation\" will not suffice.  Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We proceed to apply these tested principles to the record before us, mindful that we review the lower court's order de novo.  See Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case for summary judgment is simple and straightforward.  C-Co. says that Hayes owed money on the promissory note;  that it agreed to defer a portion of the indebtedness and release a security interest if Hayes made a partial payment of $80,000;  that the terms of this deferral were commemorated in the February 2 letter agreement;  and that, the period of the deferment having elapsed, Hayes must now pay the balance due under the note.  Hayes does not deny the authenticity of the February 2 letter agreement<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> but nonetheless contends that a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether the $80,000 payment was made and accepted in full satisfaction of the entire indebtedness.  We think that the purported \"proof\" which Hayes has assembled to substantiate his position is of a caliber which courts regularly have held insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, certain facts cannot be gainsaid:  the promissory note was validly executed, it was not paid according to its tenor, and its ownership was properly transferred to C-Co. The February 2 letter agreement commemorates the parties' mutual assent to an alternative payment arrangement and that document contains the signatures of both parties--signatures which Hayes does not allege were procured by fraud, chicanery, coercion, duress, or other untoward means.  That agreement, on its face, is clear and unambiguous.  Moreover, it reflects valid consideration given and received.  It nowhere suggests that an $80,000 payment by Hayes will discharge the indebtedness in full;  to the contrary, it states quite plainly that the receipt of $80,000 on or before a day certain will enable the obligor to defer repayment of the underlying debt for approximately one year and will bring about the immediate release of the mortgage lien which secured the debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, by presenting the letter agreement in support of its motion for brevis disposition, C-Co. discharged its initial burden under Rule 56.  The question, then, is whether Hayes, as the party opposing summary judgment, succeeded in adducing specific facts demonstrating that a trialworthy issue remains on some material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hayes argues that there is a genuine issue as to the nature of the $80,000 payment.  But this argument comprises more cry than wool.  First, he labors to create the impression that the parties entered into a series of negotiations apart from the February 2 letter agreement, and that these negotiations culminated in a new understanding that a one-time payment of $80,000 would discharge the entire debt.  The problem with this approach is that it consists entirely of gauzy generalities:  in his affidavits, Hayes does not say when or how this arrangement was consummated.  Moreover, he does not claim that he and Cadle entered into such an arrangement personally;  indeed, he does not even suggest that the two of them discussed the matter at all between February 2 and March 3. He does state that Cadle and Goodrich \"had numerous conversations\" during February of 1993, but this statement--which in all events is apparently based on something less than personal knowledge--proves nothing.  Hayes nowhere relates the details of any such conversations, nor does he indicate that Goodrich was authorized to act as an agent on his behalf.  In the absence of specific facts, Hayes' innuendoes, heatedly denied by C-Co. and refuted by Goodrich, are inadequate to block summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 583;  Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., 3 F.3d 476, 479-81 (1st Cir.1993);  Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825-26 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's ace in the hole, as he envisions it, is Goodrich's transmittal letter.  We do not believe that this communique, repudiated by its author, can trump the February 2 letter agreement.  After all, Goodrich has signed an affidavit flatly rejecting Hayes' interpretation of his (Goodrich's) letter and asserting that he never negotiated any agreement with either party as to the nature of the $80,000 payment.  Since Goodrich's March 3 epistle lacks any evidence of mutual assent by the parties, and since the record does not otherwise supply any such evidence, the epistle cannot carry the day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Hayes states in the climactic paragraph of his main affidavit that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>I believe that the Cadle Company took the $80,000.00 from Landmark Bank under the terms of an agreement between the Cadle Company and the Bank that the $80,000.00 would constitute payment in full of all of the obligations of the trust and the guarantors under the terms of the Note.  [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, neither Cadle nor Landmark acknowledge that any such agreement ever existed.

A party faced with a properly documented summary judgment motion should not be able to keep his case on life support merely by hurling conclusory allegations in the movant's direction.  So it is here:  the appellant's rhetorical flourishes are not sufficiently probative to create a genuine issue of material fact concerning the nature of the $80,000 payment.  Hence, the magistrate appropriately granted C-Co.'s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

See Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, 990 F.2d 701, 706 (1st Cir.1993).

The court below thought not and entered summary judgment in favor of the noteholder.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. A TALE OF TWO LETTERS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1990, defendant-appellant John J. Hayes, III, executed a promissory note for $150,000, secured by a mortgage on premises owned by a real estate trust that he controlled.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The lender subsequently failed and plaintiff-appellee Cadle Company (C-Co.) acquired the note (which was then in arrears) from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Cecil C. Cadle (Cadle), C-Co.'s vice president, informed Hayes of the transfer and the parties commenced negotiations.  The preliminary haggling is of no consequence because the parties reached an agreement and reduced it to writing.  Cadle wrote a letter on February 2, 1993, which stated in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This will confirm our agreement that The Cadle Company will delay the repayment period of the subject loan until February 10, 1994 if we receive $80,000 by March 2, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Cadle Company purchased your loan from the FDIC in liquidation of Boston Trade Bank and has full authority to release the lien on the real estate in return for this $80,000 payment.  We hereby agree to release the lien upon payment of the $80,000 by March 2, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant signed the letter the same day, thereby indicating his assent to the proposed terms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 3, Landmark Bank mailed a bank check for $80,000 to C-Co.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The accompanying transmittal letter, over the signature of James Goodrich, a Landmark vice president, stated in its entirety:  \"Enclosed is a check for $80,000 to satisfy in full the loan you acquired from the FDIC between the Boston Trade Bank and John J. Hayes.  Please execute a release and forward it to me as soon as possible.  Thank you very much for your help.\"   Cadle endorsed and deposited the check and forwarded a release of the mortgage lien as previously agreed.  Hayes made no further payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1994 C-Co. sued Hayes and a co-guarantor, Kevin O'Reilly, in federal district court, seeking to recover the balance due on the promissory note, plus accrued interest and collection costs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The battle lines were quickly drawn:  Hayes insisted that the $80,000 payment had satisfied in full his obligations under the note, whereas C-Co. insisted with equal adamance that the payment did no more than comply with the terms of the February 2 letter agreement (which merely deferred, rather than canceled, the obligation to pay the balance due under the note).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make a tedious tale tolerably terse, the parties agreed to have a magistrate judge, rather than a district judge, preside over the case.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(c)(1) (1994);  Fed.R.Civ.P. 73(b).  Thereafter, C-Co. moved for summary judgment, proffering, among other supporting documents, the February 2 letter agreement.  Hayes filed an opposition and an affidavit.  When C-Co. produced Goodrich's sworn statement that he had not negotiated with either Hayes or Cadle about repayment of the loan and that he had not been privy to any agreement that the $80,000 payment would discharge the entire debt, Hayes filed a supplemental affidavit.  The magistrate reviewed these and other materials, discerned no genuine issue of material fact, granted C-Co.'s motion, and entered judgment for a sum certain.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

Only if the record, viewed in that manner and without regard to credibility determinations, reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact may the court enter summary judgment.  See Greenburg v. Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"499045\"><a href=\"/opinion/499045/laurence-b-greenburg-etc-v-puerto-rico-maritime-shipping-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">835</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">932</span></a></span>, 936 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The summary judgment machinery operates in two phases.  First, the movant must make a preliminary showing that there is no genuine issue of material fact which requires resolution in the crucible of a trial.  Once this showing has been made, the burden shifts to the nonmovant to demonstrate, through specific facts, that a trialworthy issue remains.  See National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195818\"><a href=\"/opinion/195818/national-amusements-v-town-of-dedham/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 735 (1st Cir.1995);  Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the purpose of summary judgment, an issue of fact is \"genuine\" if it \"may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.\"  Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 581 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  For the same purpose, \"material\" facts are those which possess \"the capacity to sway the outcome of the litigation under the applicable law.\"  National Amusements, 43 F.3d at 735.   Still, establishing a genuine issue of material fact requires more than effusive rhetoric and optimistic surmise.  \"If the evidence [adduced in opposition to the motion] is merely colorable, or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\"  Anderson v.

In other words, the \"evidence illustrating the factual controversy cannot be conjectural or problematic;  it must have substance in the sense that it limns differing versions of the truth which a factfinder must resolve at an ensuing trial.\"  Mack v.

See Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 48 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case for summary judgment is simple and straightforward.  C-Co. says that Hayes owed money on the promissory note;  that it agreed to defer a portion of the indebtedness and release a security interest if Hayes made a partial payment of $80,000;  that the terms of this deferral were commemorated in the February 2 letter agreement;  and that, the period of the deferment having elapsed, Hayes must now pay the balance due under the note.  Hayes does not deny the authenticity of the February 2 letter agreement<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> but nonetheless contends that a genuine issue of fact exists as to whether the $80,000 payment was made and accepted in full satisfaction of the entire indebtedness.  We think that the purported \"proof\" which Hayes has assembled to substantiate his position is of a caliber which courts regularly have held insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, certain facts cannot be gainsaid:  the promissory note was validly executed, it was not paid according to its tenor, and its ownership was properly transferred to C-Co. The February 2 letter agreement commemorates the parties' mutual assent to an alternative payment arrangement and that document contains the signatures of both parties--signatures which Hayes does not allege were procured by fraud, chicanery, coercion, duress, or other untoward means.  That agreement, on its face, is clear and unambiguous.  Moreover, it reflects valid consideration given and received.  It nowhere suggests that an $80,000 payment by Hayes will discharge the indebtedness in full;  to the contrary, it states quite plainly that the receipt of $80,000 on or before a day certain will enable the obligor to defer repayment of the underlying debt for approximately one year and will bring about the immediate release of the mortgage lien which secured the debt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, by presenting the letter agreement in support of its motion for brevis disposition, C-Co. discharged its initial burden under Rule 56.  The question, then, is whether Hayes, as the party opposing summary judgment, succeeded in adducing specific facts demonstrating that a trialworthy issue remains on some material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hayes argues that there is a genuine issue as to the nature of the $80,000 payment.  But this argument comprises more cry than wool.  First, he labors to create the impression that the parties entered into a series of negotiations apart from the February 2 letter agreement, and that these negotiations culminated in a new understanding that a one-time payment of $80,000 would discharge the entire debt.  The problem with this approach is that it consists entirely of gauzy generalities:  in his affidavits, Hayes does not say when or how this arrangement was consummated.  Moreover, he does not claim that he and Cadle entered into such an arrangement personally;  indeed, he does not even suggest that the two of them discussed the matter at all between February 2 and March 3. He does state that Cadle and Goodrich \"had numerous conversations\" during February of 1993, but this statement--which in all events is apparently based on something less than personal knowledge--proves nothing.  Hayes nowhere relates the details of any such conversations, nor does he indicate that Goodrich was authorized to act as an agent on his behalf.  In the absence of specific facts, Hayes' innuendoes, heatedly denied by C-Co. and refuted by Goodrich, are inadequate to block summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See, e.g., Maldonado-Denis, 23 F.3d at 583;  Vega v. Kodak Caribbean, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628958\"><a href=\"/opinion/628958/62-fair-emplpraccas-1198-62-empl-prac-dec-p-42530-17-employee/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 479-81 (1st Cir.1993);  Mesnick v.

We do not believe that this communique, repudiated by its author, can trump the February 2 letter agreement.  After all, Goodrich has signed an affidavit flatly rejecting Hayes' interpretation of his (Goodrich's) letter and asserting that he never negotiated any agreement with either party as to the nature of the $80,000 payment.  Since Goodrich's March 3 epistle lacks any evidence of mutual assent by the parties, and since the record does not otherwise supply any such evidence, the epistle cannot carry the day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Hayes states in the climactic paragraph of his main affidavit that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>I believe that the Cadle Company took the $80,000.00 from Landmark Bank under the terms of an agreement between the Cadle Company and the Bank that the $80,000.00 would constitute payment in full of all of the obligations of the trust and the guarantors under the terms of the Note.

This is the same old whine in a slightly different bottle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, an accord and satisfaction exists when:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) [ ] there has arisen between the parties a bona fide dispute as to the existence or extent of liability;  (2)[ ] subsequent to the arising of that dispute the parties entered into an agreement under the terms of which the dispute is compromised by the payment by one party of a sum in excess of that which he admits he owed and the receipt by the other party of a sum less in amount than he claims is due him, all for the purpose of settling the dispute;  and (3) a performance by the parties of that agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rust Eng'g Co. v. Lawrence Pumps, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1604301\"><a href=\"/opinion/1604301/rust-engineering-company-v-lawrence-pumps-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">401</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span>, 333 (D.Mass.1975).  The evidence before us shows as a matter of law that no accord and satisfaction transpired here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the record reveals no dispute as to the extent of Hayes' liability under the promissory note at the time of this asserted accord;  the amount of indebtedness was not then in question, merely the method by which repayment would occur.  In the second place, the appellant has proffered no significantly probative evidence--only Hayes' bare allegations, already considered and found wanting--that the parties entered into the sort of mutual agreement that could form the basis for an accord and satisfaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Massachusetts law is pellucid that, in the absence of convincing evidence of mutual assent, mere partial payment of an existing debt does not constitute an accord and satisfaction.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  A party faced with a properly documented summary judgment motion should not be able to keep his case on life support merely by hurling conclusory allegations in the movant's direction.  So it is here:  the appellant's rhetorical flourishes are not sufficiently probative to create a genuine issue of material fact concerning the nature of the $80,000 payment.  Hence, the magistrate appropriately granted C-Co.'s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. Costs to appellee.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There is some uncertainty about whether Hayes signed the note personally or in his capacity as a trustee of the real estate trust.  The point is of purely academic interest, however, as Hayes, acting for himself, also executed an unlimited guaranty</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Although this check was sent one day later than the outside date specified in the February 2 letter agreement, neither party contends that this delay matters and we deem any discrepancy to be waived</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> O'Reilly is not a party to this appeal and we abjure any further reference to him</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the appellant alludes vaguely to certain prior negotiations, but these cannot influence our decision as any such negotiations were clearly superseded by the execution and delivery of the letter agreement.  See, e.g., Brennan v. Carvel Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"558569\"><a href=\"/opinion/558569/robert-brennan-and-joanne-brennan-v-carvel-corporation-and-raymond/\"><span class=\"volume\">929</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></a></span>, 806 (1st Cir.1991);  Amerada Hess Corp. v.

A party's own affidavit, containing relevant information of which he has first-hand knowledge, may be self-serving, but it is nonetheless competent to support or defeat summary judgment.  See Nereida-Gonzalez v. Tirado-Delgado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"604127\"><a href=\"/opinion/604127/carmen-nereida-gonzalez-v-cirilo-tirado-delgado/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span>, 706 (1st Cir.1993).  The difficulty with Hayes' affidavits is not that they are self-serving but that they neither contain enough specifics nor speak meaningfully to matters within Hayes' personal knowledge</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The fact that C-Co. deposited the $80,000 check proves nothing, as that action was entirely consistent with the provisions of the February 2 letter agreement</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> On this point, Hayes' case stands in stark contrast to Bud McDevitt Real Estate, Inc. v. Corona, 27 Mass.App.Ct. 1129, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></span>, 609 (1989), in which the Appeals Court held that a letter from one party to another, explicitly stating that cashing an enclosed check would constitute settlement of any and all claims, ripened into an accord and satisfaction when the check was deposited</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
