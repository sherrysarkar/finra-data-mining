Although  Travelers contends that  Reidy\r\n\nproved incapable of performing his  work as a claims  representa-\r\n\ntive despite  a reasonable  accommodation  of his  stress-related\r\n\n\"disability,\"  Reidy  asserts that  Travelers'  justification was\r\n\npretextual.

See Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  151B,     4(1.B),\r                                   \r\n\n4(16), 5, 9; Clarke v. Kentucky Fried Chicken of Calif., Inc., 57\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 1995); Andrews v. Arkwright Mut. Ins.  Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n673 N.E.2d 40, 41  (Mass. 1996).  Reidy contends that his counsel\r\n\nmailed  a formal complaint  to the MCAD  on August  30, 1991, but\r\n\nthere is  no evidence to  confirm its receipt  by the MCAD.   The\r\n\nofficial  MCAD  record  itself   reflects  no  formal  complaint.\r\n\nMoreover,  on September  20,  the MCAD  compliance officer  wrote\r\n\nReidy  and  confirmed  the   receipt  of  his  letter  describing\r               \r\n\nTravelers'  alleged discriminatory  conduct,  but advised  that a\r                                                                           \r\n\nformal  complaint  would  still  be necessary  to  initiate  MCAD\r                           \r\n\naction.   A  copy of  the  MCAD letter  was  provided to  Reidy's\r\n\ncounsel as well.  \r\n\n          Although the MCAD letter  plainly placed both Reidy and\r\n\ncounsel on notice that the MCAD had received a letter from Reidy,\r                                                                          \r\n\nrather than any August 30 letter from Reidy's counsel enclosing a\r\n\nformal MCAD complaint,  neither Reidy nor counsel followed  up on\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nthis obvious discrepancy or on the formal advice contained in the\r\n\nletter  from  the MCAD  compliance  officer.2   Accordingly,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  lacked  jurisdiction  and  the  employment-based\r\n\ndiscrimination claims were properly dismissed.3\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                                                                 \r                                                                           \r\n\n     2Thus,  Reidy's insistence that  the summary judgment ruling\r               2\r\npenalized him for MCAD's administrative incompetence lacks record\r                                \r\nsupport.  Of course, if cognizable, such unsubstantiated \"defens-\r\nes\" would all but eviscerate the exhaustion requirement.\r\n\n     3Since Reidy no longer holds actionable employment discrimi-\r               3\r\nnation  claims  against  Travelers, the  district  court properly\r\ndismissed  the related claims by the spouse and children as well.\r\nSee Tauriac v.

Reidy contends that his counsel\r\n\nmailed  a formal complaint  to the MCAD  on August  30, 1991, but\r\n\nthere is  no evidence to  confirm its receipt  by the MCAD.   The\r\n\nofficial  MCAD  record  itself   reflects  no  formal  complaint.\r\n\nMoreover,  on September  20,  the MCAD  compliance officer  wrote\r\n\nReidy  and  confirmed  the   receipt  of  his  letter  describing\r               \r\n\nTravelers'  alleged discriminatory  conduct,  but advised  that a\r                                                                           \r\n\nformal  complaint  would  still  be necessary  to  initiate  MCAD\r                           \r\n\naction.   A  copy of  the  MCAD letter  was  provided to  Reidy's\r\n\ncounsel as well.  \r\n\n          Although the MCAD letter  plainly placed both Reidy and\r\n\ncounsel on notice that the MCAD had received a letter from Reidy,\r                                                                          \r\n\nrather than any August 30 letter from Reidy's counsel enclosing a\r\n\nformal MCAD complaint,  neither Reidy nor counsel followed  up on\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nthis obvious discrepancy or on the formal advice contained in the\r\n\nletter  from  the MCAD  compliance  officer.2   Accordingly,  the\r\n\ndistrict  court  lacked  jurisdiction  and  the  employment-based\r\n\ndiscrimination claims were properly dismissed.3\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                    Affirmed.\r                            \r\n\n                                                                 \r                                                                           \r\n\n     2Thus,  Reidy's insistence that  the summary judgment ruling\r               2\r\npenalized him for MCAD's administrative incompetence lacks record\r                                \r\nsupport.  Of course, if cognizable, such unsubstantiated \"defens-\r\nes\" would all but eviscerate the exhaustion requirement.\r\n\n     3Since Reidy no longer holds actionable employment discrimi-\r               3\r\nnation  claims  against  Travelers, the  district  court properly\r\ndismissed  the related claims by the spouse and children as well.\r\nSee Tauriac v.
