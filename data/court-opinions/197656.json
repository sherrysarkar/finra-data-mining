James  A.   Crochiere,   a\r                  LYNCH,   Circuit  Judge.\r                                         \r\n\ncorrectional officer at  the Worcester County Jail  and House\r\n\nof  Correction,  was  indicted on  charges  of  violating and\r\n\nconspiring  to  violate  the  civil  rights  of  a  pre-trial\r\n\ndetainee  at  the jail.    See  18  U.S.C.     2,  241,  242.\r                                          \r\n\nCrochiere was charged with the  act of and conspiracy to pour\r\n\nboiling water  on the groin  and upper thigh of  Jose Nieves,\r\n\nwho had  been arrested  on the charges  of murdering  a young\r\n\ngirl.  A jury found  Crochiere guilty of the conspiracy count\r\n\nand acquitted him of the substantive count.  \r\n\n      Crochiere   makes  three   arguments  on   appeal.    He\r\n\nchallenges the district  court's denial of  his motion for  a\r\n\njury view  of the  scene of the  crime.   He contends  that a\r\n\nportion  of the  district court's  jury  instructions on  the\r\n\nconspiracy  count  was  erroneous in  that  the  instructions\r\n\ncharged  that no \"overt  act\" is required  under the criminal\r\n\ncivil rights  conspiracy statute, 18  U.S.C.   241.   He also\r\n\nargues that the evidence  was insufficient to convict  him on\r\n\nthe conspiracy  count.  We affirm  and hold that 18  U.S.C.  \r\n\n241, the civil rights conspiracy statute, does not require an\r\n\novert act.  \r\n\n                             I.  \r\n\n      We state  the facts in the  light most favorable to  the\r\n\nverdict.  See United  States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 778 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir.  1994).  On  April 18, 1993, Jose  Nieves was brought to\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nthe jail to await trial on charges that he murdered a  twelve\r\n\nyear old  girl.  Nieves,  a heroin addict who  was undergoing\r\n\ndetoxification, became  highly agitated  and unruly,  banging\r\n\nhis head  against the bars of his cell.   Nieves cut open his\r\n\nforehead.   Several  correctional  officers, Crochiere  among\r\n\nthem, came  to Nieves's cell  to restrain him.   The officers\r\n\nhandcuffed  Nieves and strapped  him into a  restraint chair.\r\n\nNieves  strongly resisted; the officers placed a blanket over\r\n\nNieves's head to  prevent him from spitting.   The first time\r\n\nthe officers  placed Nieves  in the restraint  chair, he  was\r\n\nable to free himself from the arm straps.  The second attempt\r\n\nat  restraint  was  more  successful,  and  once  Nieves  was\r\n\nsecurely in the chair he was no longer a threat to himself or\r\n\nto the officers.  \r\n\n      Rodney Lambert  was another pre-trial  detainee; he  was\r\n\nindicted   on  the  same  federal  civil  rights  charges  as\r\n\nCrochiere.   He pled  guilty, cooperated with  the government\r\n\nand testified against Crochiere.  His  cell was located three\r\n\ncells down from Nieves's cell.  Lambert had a hot pot  in his\r\n\ncell, and after Nieves was  restrained and the commotion died\r\n\ndown,  Lambert began  boiling  water  for  soup.    Crochiere\r\n\napproached Lambert's  cell and  asked Lambert  if he  had any\r\n\nsalt.  Crochiere wanted  to rub salt  into the open wound  on\r\n\nNieves's forehead.  Lambert said that he did not, but offered\r\n\nCrochiere  an alternative  weapon: a  cup  of boiling  water.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nCrochiere initially declined the offer, but soon returned and\r\n\nrequested  the  boiling liquid.    Lambert  poured a  cup  of\r\n\nsteaming  water for  Crochiere, who took  the cup  and walked\r\n\ntoward Nieves's cell.  Moments  later, Nieves screamed out in\r\n\npain, exclaiming that \"[t]hey burned my pee pee,\" and that he\r\n\nwas hurt.   Following these screams, another voice said, \"Now\r\n\nyou know how the little girl felt.\"  \r\n\n      Among the government's witnesses who testified to  these\r\n\nevents were Michael Robichaud, a correctional officer on duty\r\n\non  the  evening  of  April  18, 1993;  Foimai  Tau,  a  Unit\r\n\nSupervisor  on  duty  the same  evening;  and  Scott Croteau,\r\n\nAnibal  Antuna, and Rodney Lambert, three inmates whose cells\r\n\nwere located in the same tier as Nieves's cell.\r\n\n      Nieves complained  to Officer Robichaud  of pain  in his\r\n\ngroin.  Robichaud related this information to Lieutenant Tau,\r\n\nthe Unit Supervisor.  Lieutenant  Tau went to see Nieves, who\r\n\nasked to see a nurse because someone had poured  hot water on\r\n\nhim.   Lieutenant Tau  summoned Nurse  Elaine Gustafson,  who\r\n\nspoke with Nieves but, being at the end of her shift, refused\r\n\nto examine him.  Nurse  Dorothy Hester, the supervising nurse\r\n\nat  the jail,  did  examine  Nieves  the  following  morning.\r\n\nBecause Nieves told her  he had an injury in his  groin area,\r\n\nshe examined that area and observed a second-degree burn with\r\n\nblisters.   The burn extended  down to his inner  thigh area,\r\n\nand upwards to his testicles.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n      On  April 20,  two days  after  the burning,  Nieves was\r\n\ntaken  to  Bridgewater  State  Hospital for  a  psychological\r\n\nexamination  as  to his  competence  to stand  trial  for the\r\n\ncharge  of murder.   A  correctional  officer at  Bridgewater\r\n\nState conducted a routine strip search of Nieves and observed\r\n\nblisters  and injury  in Nieves's  groin area.    Pursuant to\r\n\nroutine practice the officer photographed the injury, and the\r\n\nphotograph  was  later  sent, along  with  a  report,  to the\r\n\nWorcester County Sheriff's Office.  Kevin   Foley,  Assistant\r\n\nDeputy  Superintendent  of  the  Worcester  County  Sheriff's\r\n\nOffice, then  commendably initiated an  investigation of  the\r\n\nburning.  Foley  requested reports regarding  Nieves's injury\r\n\nfrom  several  individuals,  including  Crochiere,  Tau,  and\r\n\nGustafson.  All  of them denied that Nieves  had been burned,\r\n\nor  that Nieves had complained of pain and of being burned by\r\n\na correctional officer.  The following year, around September\r\n\nof  1994, the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigations  began  an\r\n\ninvestigation into  the events  surrounding Nieves's  injury,\r\n\nwhich, in turn,  led to the prosecution of this  case.  Nurse\r\n\nGustafson and Supervisor Tau  eventually testified that  they\r\n\nhad previously reported  falsely on the  events of April  18,\r\n\n1993, and stated that Nieves actually did complain of pain in\r\n\nhis groin  and told  them that he  had been  burned with  hot\r\n\nwater.\r\n\n                            II.  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nJury View\r                     \r\n\n      On the  second day  of trial, Crochiere  filed a  motion\r\n\nfor a jury view  of the lower left tier of cells at the jail,\r\n\nthe location of  these events.  Crochiere argued  that it was\r\n\nonly  by viewing  the tier  of  cells that  the jurors  could\r\n\nproperly  assess the  validity  of  the  statements  made  by\r\n\nseveral  of the witnesses -- specifically inmates Croteau and\r\n\nLambert -- about  what they saw and heard on that night.  The\r\n\ndistrict judge initially  deferred the decision on  the view,\r\n\nso that he could hear more of the evidence and \"have a better\r\n\nsense of whether  a view [would be]  important and worthwhile\r\n\nin the context of the case.\"  The court ultimately denied the\r\n\nview, reasoning that it would be \"not just an unnecessary use\r\n\nof  time, but actually potentially confusing and  misleading,\r\n\nbecause neither Croteau  nor Lambert said that they could see\r\n\nanybody  going into Nieves's  cell or  see anything  that was\r\n\ngoing on in the cell.\"\r\n\n      The decision to permit a view is entrusted to the  sound\r\n\ndiscretion  of  the  trial  court.    See  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nPettiford, 962 F.2d 74, 76  (1st Cir. 1992); United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nPassos-Paternina, 918 F.2d 979, 986 (1st Cir. 1990).  A court\r                            \r\n\ngenerally acts within that discretion in denying a motion for\r\n\na view when there is sufficient evidence describing the scene\r\n\nin  the form  of testimony,  diagrams, or  photographs.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nPettiford, 962 F.2d at 76; United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n8, 31  (1st Cir.  1984).  In  making this  determination, the\r\n\ncourt may  consider such  factors as  the orderliness  of the\r\n\ntrial, whether the jury would be confused or misled,  whether\r\n\nit  would be  time-consuming  or logistically  difficult, and\r\n\nwhether cross-examination  had been  permitted regarding  the\r\n\ndetails of  the scene.   See id.; Pettiford, 962  F.2d at 76;\r                                                       \r\n\nPassos-Paternina, 918 F.2d at 986; Bundy v.  Dugger, 850 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n1402, 1422 (11th Cir. 1988). \r\n\n      Crochiere  made a  non-frivolous argument in  support of\r\n\nthe view as to the events in Nieves's cell which underlay the\r\n\nviolation  of  civil   rights  charge,  as  opposed   to  the\r\n\nconspiracy charge.  Inmates Croteau and Lambert did at  times\r\n\ntestify to having been able  to see beyond what was happening\r\n\nin front of their own  cells.  For example, Lambert testified\r\n\nthat he could  see officers walking into and  out of Nieves s\r\n\ncell, and that he could see Crochiere \"in front of one of the\r\n\ncells  to  [his] right.\"    The  evidence  in this  case  was\r\n\nsomewhat inconsistent, and the credibility of each  witness s\r\n\nstory as to what he saw and when he saw it was critical.  The\r\n\naverage juror has not seen a jail cell block, and  might well\r\n\nhave  difficulty understanding the layout and the ability (or\r\n\ninability) of inmates  to see up and down  the corridor where\r\n\nNieves's  cell  was   located.    Crochiere  contended   that\r\n\nphotographs  and charts could not  do adequate justice to the\r\n\nlayout and  spacial  arrangements of  the  cell block.    Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nPettiford, 962  F.2d at  76 (upholding denial  of view  where\r                     \r\n\nview would not have provided  clearer portrayal of scene than\r\n\nphotographs did).\r\n\n      It  is also  true, as  the  district judge  noted,  that\r\n\nneither Croteau  nor Lambert  testified that  they could  see\r\n\ninto Nieves's  cell.  Most  of the inmates' testimony  was of\r\n\nwhat they heard, and what  they saw happen in front  of their\r\n\nown cells.   A view would  not have helped to  discredit this\r\n\ntestimony.  Additionally, the defendant had ample opportunity\r\n\nto  cross-examine the various  government witnesses  on their\r\n\nability to perceive  what they claimed to see.   The question\r\n\nof  the view was  not an easy  one, and the  district judge's\r\n\ndecision was considered.\r\n\n      In  light of  the  acquittal  on  the substantive  civil\r\n\nrights charge,  we need  not decide  the question of  whether\r\n\nthere was  an abuse of discretion  in denying the view.   Any\r\n\nerror Crochiere may  claim in this ruling was  harmless.  \"In\r\n\nthe usual  case, a non-constitutional  evidentiary error will\r\n\nbe  treated as  harmless if  it is  highly probable  that the\r\n\nerror did not contribute to  the verdict.\"  See United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1414 (1st Cir. 1997).  The government\r                   \r\n\nbears the burden of persuasion  in a harmless error analysis.\r\n\nSee id.        The  view   was  relevant  primarily   to  the\r                   \r\n\nsubstantive    242 Count,  of which Crochiere  was acquitted,\r\n\nand not to the conspiracy count.  The  evidence was more than\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nadequate  to support the conspiracy count that Crochiere took\r\n\nboiling water  from Lambert after  saying he wanted a  way to\r\n\nhurt Nieves.  View or  no view, Lambert plainly was competent\r\n\nto  testify about what he did in his own cell and what he and\r\n\nCrochiere said there.  Inmate Croteau also testified  that he\r\n\nsaw  Crochiere  walk  past  his  cell  in  the  direction  of\r\n\nLambert's cell, which was directly  to the left of  Croteau's\r\n\ncell.   Croteau stated  that he then  heard Crochiere  say to\r\n\nLambert,  \"Can  I  get  some  of  that?\"  and  then  observed\r\n\nCrochiere walk past Croteau's cell again, in the direction of\r\n\nNieves's cell, this  time carrying a cup  of steaming liquid.\r\n\nA view  would not  have undercut any  of this  testimony, all\r\n\ndirectly relevant to the conspiracy count.\r\n\n      Crochiere  argues that  the  view  was  relevant to  the\r\n\nconspiracy   count   because  it   directly   implicated  the\r\n\nwitnesses' credibility.  Although a view might  have had some\r\n\nindirect   impact  on  the   jury's  assessment   of  witness\r\n\ncredibility,  Crochiere had  ample  opportunity to,  and did,\r\n\nimpeach  the witnesses' credibility  in a variety  of ways at\r\n\ntrial.  The  jury nevertheless chose to  believe the evidence\r\n\nsupporting the  conspiracy count, and a view  was unlikely to\r\n\nhave altered this outcome.\r\n\nJury Instructions:  Overt Acts\r                                          \r\n\n      Crochiere argues  that the district court gave erroneous\r\n\njury  instructions on the  elements of  a conspiracy  under  \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\n241, because  the court  stated that the  government was  not\r\n\nrequired  to  prove   the  existence  of  an   overt  act  in\r\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.  Crochiere did not submit  any\r\n\nproposed  instructions on    241,  nor did  he object  to the\r\n\nabsence   of  an  overt  act  instruction  when  specifically\r\n\nquestioned on  this issue  by the district  judge.

In none of  the Fifth  Circuit\r\n\ncases, however, was the question a central issue in the case.\r\n\nThe Sixth Circuit has stated, also in dictum, that   241 does\r\n\nrequire proof of  an overt act.

In Shabani,  the  Court found  that\r                                                \r\n\nthere was no overt act  requirement where the language of the\r\n\ndrug  conspiracy statute,  there 21  U.S.C.    846,1  did not\r\n\nrequire  proof  of  an  overt  act, and  the  common  law  of\r\n\nconspiracy  at the  time  the  statute  was enacted  did  not\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n1.  21 U.S.C.   846 provides:\r\n\n      Any person who attempts or conspires to commit any\r\n      offense  defined  in   this  subchapter  shall  be\r\n      subject to  the same penalties as those prescribed\r\n      for the offense,  the commission of which  was the\r\n      object of the attempt or conspiracy.\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nrequire an  overt act.

The Supreme Court noted that\r\n\nthe language of  the statute does not require  \"that an overt\r\n\nact be  committed to further  the conspiracy, and  [the Court\r\n\nhas] not  inferred  such  a  requirement  from  congressional\r\n\nsilence in other  conspiracy statutes.\"  Shabani, 513 U.S. at\r                                                            \r\n\n13 (citing Nash v.

In  response to  Shabani's  argument that  the  law does  not\r\npunish  criminal  thoughts,   the  Court   replied  that   \"[t]he\r\nprohibition against criminal conspiracy, however, does not punish\r\nmere thought; the criminal agreement itself is the actus reus . .\r\n. .\"  Shabani, 813 U.S. at 16.\r                       \r\n\n                             -12-\r                                          12\r\r\n\nunderstanding of conspiracy when it used the word \"conspire.\"\r\n\nThe legislative history of    241 reveals no contrary intent,\r\n\nand at common law \"it was neither necessary to aver nor prove\r\n\nan overt  act in furtherance  of the conspiracy.\"   Bannon v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nUnited  States, 156 U.S. 464, 468  (1895), quoted in Shabani,\r                                                                        \r\n\n513 U.S. at 14.\r\n\n      In Shabani,  the Court compared the language of the drug\r                            \r\n\nconspiracy  statute,  which  contains no  express  overt  act\r\n\nrequirement,  with  the language  of  the  general conspiracy\r\n\nstatute,  18 U.S.C.    371,3  which  does contain  an express\r\n\novert  act requirement.    The  Court  found  this  dichotomy\r\n\n\"instructive,\" noting  that \"[i]n  light  of this  additional\r\n\nelement in  the general conspiracy statute, Congress' silence\r\n\nin   846  speaks volumes.  After all,  the general conspiracy\r\n\nstatute preceded  and presumably  provided the  framework for\r\n\nthe more  specific drug  conspiracy statute.\"   Shabani,  513\r                                                                   \r\n\nU.S. at 14.  \r\n\n      The general  conspiracy statute, 18  U.S.C.    371, with\r\n\nits   explicit  overt  act  requirement,  also  preceded  the\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n3.  18 U.S.C.   371 provides, in relevant part:\r\n\n      If two or  more persons conspire either  to commit\r\n      any offense against the United States . . . or any\r\n      agency thereof in  any manner or for  any purpose,\r\n      and  one or  more of  such persons  do any  act to\r                                                                    \r\n      effect the object  of the  conspiracy, each  shall\r                                                       \r\n      [be subject to criminal penalties].\r\n\n(emphasis added)\r\n\n                             -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nenactment of     241.   The  general conspiracy  statute  was\r\n\noriginally enacted  by Congress in  1867, 14 Stat.  484, Add.\r\n\n25,  and  remains  essentially unchanged  today.    The civil\r\n\nrights conspiracy  statute, 18 U.S.C.    241, was  enacted in\r\n\n1870, \"as  part of what came  to be known as  the Enforcement\r\n\nAct of  1870,\"  United  States v.  Price, 383  U.S. 787,  801\r                                                    \r\n\n(1966) (footnote omitted), and  also remains in substantially\r\n\nthe same  form today.  By  the time it enacted what  is now  \r\n\n241,  Congress had,  when it  wanted to  import an  overt act\r\n\nrequirement, made it explicit.   But Congress chose not to do\r\n\nso in    241.   We  recognize, but  are not  persuaded by,  a\r\n\ncontrary  argument that Congress, having placed the overt act\r\n\nrequirement  in  the  general  conspiracy  statute,  felt  it\r\n\nunnecessary  to  place  such language  in  future  conspiracy\r\n\nstatutes although it fully intended the overt act requirement\r\n\nto apply.   This argument cannot be squared  with the Shabini\r                                                                         \r\n\nCourt's interpretation of congressional silence. \r\n\n      Our conclusion that Congress did  not intend to  require\r\n\nan overt  act in    241 is  bolstered by Supreme  Court cases\r\n\nthat have  emphasized the breadth of     241 and 242, and the\r\n\nprosecutorial force that Congress intended to give them.   In\r\n\nPrice, the  Court discussed  the history of     241  and 242.\r                 \r\n\nThe Court noted that the statutes \r\n\n      must  be viewed against the events and passions of\r\n      the time.  The Civil  War had ended in April 1865.\r\n      Relations   between   Negroes  and   whites   were\r\n      increasingly  turbulent.     Congress   had  taken\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n      control  of  the  entire governmental  process  in\r\n      former Confederate States. \r\n\n            . . . .\r\n\n            Within  the  Congress pressures  mounted  in\r\n      the period between the end of the war and 1870 for\r\n      drastic  measures.  . .  .  On May  31,  1870, the\r\n      Enforcement  Act  of  1870  [current     241]  was\r\n      enacted.  \r\n            In  this context,  it is  hardly conceivable\r\n      that Congress  intended   241  to apply only  to a\r\n      narrow  and  relatively  unimportant  category  of\r\n      rights.\r\n\nId.  at 803-05  (footnotes  omitted).    Although  the  Price\r                                                                         \r\n\nCourt's focus was on  the rights that   241  protects and not\r\n\non the existence  of an overt act requirement, its discussion\r\n\nprovides  strong   support  for  the  proposition   that  the\r\n\nReconstruction Era  Congress did not  intend   241 to  have a\r\n\nnarrow  scope.    Given this  backdrop,  it  is difficult  to\r\n\nimagine that  Congress could  have intended  a definition  of\r\n\nconspiracy in    241  that was narrower  than the  common law\r                                                   \r\n\ndefinition  of the  term.   Were we  to judicially  import on\r\n\novert  act requirement,  we would  be narrowing  the type  of\r\n\nactivity that  Congress intended to  reach when it  enacted  \r\n\n241.  This we are not authorized to do.\r\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence\r                                       \r\n\n      Crochiere's final challenge  to his conviction  rests on\r\n\nthe contentions that  his conviction on the  conspiracy count\r\n\ncannot stand because it is inconsistent with the acquittal on\r\n\nthe substantive count, and that  in any event the evidence on\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\nthe  conspiracy count  was  insufficient  for  a  finding  of\r\n\nguilty.  We reject these claims.   \r\n\n      Even  if  the  verdicts were  inconsistent,  the Supreme\r\n\nCourt  and this court  have clearly stated  that inconsistent\r\n\nverdicts are no  basis for setting aside a  conviction.4  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited  States v.

A guilty  verdict  on Count  Two would  have\r\n\nrequired the  jury to find that Crochiere  himself poured the\r\n\n                  \r                              \r\n\n4.

The jury  was not\r\n\nrequired to find either of these elements beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt to  convict on  the conspiracy count  alone.   The jury\r\n\ncould  easily  have  concluded  that  there  was  not  enough\r\n\nevidence  to prove beyond  a reasonable doubt  that Crochiere\r\n\nwas  the individual who  actually poured the  scalding liquid\r\n\nonto  Nieves's  lap.    There  was  no  eyewitness  testimony\r\n\nregarding this act.  On  the other hand, there was eyewitness\r\n\ntestimony on the conspiracy count.  Lambert testified that he\r\n\ngave the  cup of steaming  water to Crochiere  intending that\r\n\nthe water be  used to hurt Nieves.   There was ample evidence\r\n\nfrom which the jury could have concluded that Crochiere was a\r\n\nwilling participant, and harbored the same unlawful intent to\r\n\npunish  Nieves.  Crochiere  had previously asked  Lambert for\r\n\nsalt  to  rub  into  Nieves's  bleeding  forehead.    Croteau\r\n\ntestified that he heard Crochiere  say \"give me some of that\"\r\n\nto  Lambert, and  that moments  later  Crochiere walked  past\r\n\nCroteau's cell with a cup  of steaming water in the direction\r\n\nof  Nieves's cell.    Robichaud testified  that  he saw  this\r\n\nexchange occur between Lambert and Crochiere.  \r\n\n      In  sum,  a  jury  could  easily  have  found sufficient\r\n\nevidence  for a  conviction  on  the  conspiracy  count,  and\r\n\ninsufficient evidence  for  a conviction  on the  substantive\r\n\ncount,  without  these  different  outcomes  being  logically\r\n\n                             -17-\r                                          17\r\r\n\ninconsistent.   This  analysis also  disposes of  Crochiere's\r\n\nclaim that his motion for a judgment of acquittal should have\r\n\nbeen granted  by the district court because  the evidence was\r\n\ninsufficient to support a finding of guilty on the conspiracy\r\n\ncount.

Crochiere, a correctional officer at the Worcester County Jail and House of Correction, was indicted on charges of violating and conspiring to violate the civil rights of a pre-trial detainee at the jail.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 241, 242.  Crochiere was charged with the act of and conspiracy to pour boiling water on the groin and upper thigh of Jose Nieves, who had been arrested on the charges of murdering a young girl.  A jury found Crochiere guilty of the conspiracy count and acquitted him of the substantive count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crochiere makes three arguments on appeal.  He challenges the district court's denial of his motion for a jury view of the scene of the crime.  He contends that a portion of the district court's jury instructions on the conspiracy count was erroneous in that the instructions charged that no \"overt act\" is required under the criminal civil rights conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241.  He also argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on the conspiracy count.  We affirm and hold that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241, the civil rights conspiracy statute, does not require an overt act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United States v. Montas, 41 F.3d 775, 778 (1st Cir.1994).  On April 18, 1993, Jose Nieves was brought to the jail to await trial on charges that he murdered a twelve year old girl.  Nieves, a heroin addict who was undergoing detoxification, became highly agitated and unruly, banging his head against the bars of his cell.  Nieves cut open his forehead.  Several correctional officers, Crochiere among them, came to Nieves's cell to restrain him.  The officers handcuffed Nieves and strapped him into a restraint chair.  Nieves strongly resisted;  the officers placed a blanket over Nieves's head to prevent him from spitting.  The first time the officers placed Nieves in the restraint chair, he was able to free himself from the arm straps.  The second attempt at restraint was more successful, and once Nieves was securely in the chair he was no longer a threat to himself or to the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodney Lambert was another pre-trial detainee;  he was indicted on the same federal civil rights charges as Crochiere.  He pled guilty, cooperated with the government and testified against Crochiere.  His cell was located three cells down from Nieves's cell.  Lambert had a hot pot in his cell, and after Nieves was restrained and the commotion died down, Lambert began boiling water for soup.  Crochiere approached Lambert's cell and asked Lambert if he had any salt.  Crochiere wanted to rub salt into the open wound on Nieves's forehead.  Lambert said that he did not, but offered Crochiere an alternative weapon:  a cup of boiling water.  Crochiere initially declined the offer, but soon returned and requested the boiling liquid.  Lambert poured a cup of steaming water for Crochiere, who took the cup and walked toward Nieves's cell.  Moments later, Nieves screamed out in pain, exclaiming that \"[t]hey burned my pee pee,\" and that he was hurt.  Following these screams, another voice said, \"Now you know how the little girl felt.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the government's witnesses who testified to these events were Michael Robichaud, a correctional officer on duty on the evening of April 18, 1993;  Foimai Tau, a Unit Supervisor on duty the same evening;  and Scott Croteau, Anibal Antuna, and Rodney Lambert, three inmates whose cells were located in the same tier as Nieves's cell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nieves complained to Officer Robichaud of pain in his groin.  Robichaud related this information to Lieutenant Tau, the Unit Supervisor.  Lieutenant Tau went to see Nieves, who asked to see a nurse because someone had poured hot water on him.  Lieutenant Tau summoned Nurse Elaine Gustafson, who spoke with Nieves but, being at the end of her shift, refused to examine him.  Nurse Dorothy Hester, the supervising nurse at the jail, did examine Nieves the following morning.  Because Nieves told her he had an injury in his groin area, she examined that area and observed a second-degree burn with blisters.  The burn extended down to his inner thigh area, and upwards to his testicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 20, two days after the burning, Nieves was taken to Bridgewater State Hospital for a psychological examination as to his competence to stand trial for the charge of murder.  A correctional officer at Bridgewater State conducted a routine strip search of Nieves and observed blisters and injury in Nieves's groin area.  Pursuant to routine practice the officer photographed the injury, and the photograph was later sent, along with a report, to the Worcester County Sheriff's Office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kevin Foley, Assistant Deputy Superintendent of the Worcester County Sheriff's Office, then commendably initiated an investigation of the burning.  Foley requested reports regarding Nieves's injury from several individuals, including Crochiere, Tau, and Gustafson.  All of them denied that Nieves had been burned, or that Nieves had complained of pain and of being burned by a correctional officer.  The following year, around September of 1994, the Federal Bureau of Investigations began an investigation into the events surrounding Nieves's injury, which, in turn, led to the prosecution of this case.  Nurse Gustafson and Supervisor Tau eventually testified that they had previously reported falsely on the events of April 18, 1993, and stated that Nieves actually did complain of pain in his groin and told them that he had been burned with hot water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Jury View</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second day of trial, Crochiere filed a motion for a jury view of the lower left tier of cells at the jail, the location of these events.  Crochiere argued that it was only by viewing the tier of cells that the jurors could properly assess the validity of the statements made by several of the witnesses --specifically inmates Croteau and Lambert--about what they saw and heard on that night.  The district judge initially deferred the decision on the view, so that he could hear more of the evidence and \"have a better sense of whether a view [would be] important and worthwhile in the context of the case.\"   The court ultimately denied the view, reasoning that it would be \"not just an unnecessary use of time, but actually potentially confusing and misleading, because neither Croteau nor Lambert said that they could see anybody going into Nieves's cell or see anything that was going on in the cell.\"The decision to permit a view is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.  See United States v. Pettiford, 962 F.2d 74, 76 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Passos-Paternina, 918 F.2d 979, 986 (1st Cir.1990).  A court generally acts within that discretion in denying a motion for a view when there is sufficient evidence describing the scene in the form of testimony, diagrams, or photographs.  See Pettiford, 962 F.2d at 76;  United States v. Drougas, 748 F.2d 8, 31 (1st Cir.1984).  In making this determination, the court may consider such factors as the orderliness of the trial, whether the jury would be confused or misled, whether it would be time-consuming or logistically difficult, and whether cross-examination had been permitted regarding the details of the scene.  See id.;  Pettiford, 962 F.2d at 76;  Passos-Paternina, 918 F.2d at 986;  Bundy v. Dugger, 850 F.2d 1402, 1422 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crochiere made a non-frivolous argument in support of the view as to the events in Nieves's cell which underlay the violation of civil rights charge, as opposed to the conspiracy charge.  Inmates Croteau and Lambert did at times testify to having been able to see beyond what was happening in front of their own cells.  For example, Lambert testified that he could see officers walking into and out of Nieves's cell, and that he could see Crochiere \"in front of one of the cells to [his] right.\"   The evidence in this case was somewhat inconsistent, and the credibility of each witness's story as to what he saw and when he saw it was critical.  The average juror has not seen a jail cell block, and might well have difficulty understanding the layout and the ability (or inability) of inmates to see up and down the corridor where Nieves's cell was located.  Crochiere contended that photographs and charts could not do adequate justice to the layout and spacial arrangements of the cell block.  Cf. Pettiford, 962 F.2d at 76 (upholding denial of view where view would not have provided clearer portrayal of scene than photographs did).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also true, as the district judge noted, that neither Croteau nor Lambert testified that they could see into Nieves's cell.  Most of the inmates' testimony was of what they heard, and what they saw happen in front of their own cells.  A view would not have helped to discredit this testimony.  Additionally, the defendant had ample opportunity to cross-examine the various government witnesses on their ability to perceive what they claimed to see.  The question of the view was not an easy one, and the district judge's decision was considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the acquittal on the substantive civil rights charge, we need not decide the question of whether there was an abuse of discretion in denying the view.  Any error Crochiere may claim in this ruling was harmless.  \"In the usual case, a non-constitutional evidentiary error will be treated as harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\"   See United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1414 (1st Cir.1997).  The government bears the burden of persuasion in a harmless error analysis.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The view was relevant primarily to the substantive &#167; 242 Count, of which Crochiere was acquitted, and not to the conspiracy count.  The evidence was more than adequate to support the conspiracy count that Crochiere took boiling water from Lambert after saying he wanted a way to hurt Nieves.  View or no view, Lambert plainly was competent to testify about what he did in his own cell and what he and Crochiere said there.  Inmate Croteau also testified that he saw Crochiere walk past his cell in the direction of Lambert's cell, which was directly to the left of Croteau's cell.  Croteau stated that he then heard Crochiere say to Lambert, \"Can I get some of that?\" and then observed Crochiere walk past Croteau's cell again, in the direction of Nieves's cell, this time carrying a cup of steaming liquid.  A view would not have undercut any of this testimony, all directly relevant to the conspiracy count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crochiere argues that the view was relevant to the conspiracy count because it directly implicated the witnesses' credibility.  Although a view might have had some indirect impact on the jury's assessment of witness credibility, Crochiere had ample opportunity to, and did, impeach the witnesses' credibility in a variety of ways at trial.  The jury nevertheless chose to believe the evidence supporting the conspiracy count, and a view was unlikely to have altered this outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Jury Instructions:  Overt Acts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crochiere argues that the district court gave erroneous jury instructions on the elements of a conspiracy under &#167; 241, because the court stated that the government was not required to prove the existence of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Crochiere did not submit any proposed instructions on &#167; 241, nor did he object to the absence of an overt act instruction when specifically questioned on this issue by the district judge.  In these circumstances, the standard of review is plain error.  See United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1003 (1st Cir.1995).  Under this standard, the burden rests with Crochiere to establish that \"the error was 'clear,' in the sense that it was 'obvious,' that it affected 'substantial rights,' and that failure to vacate [the conviction] would result in a 'miscarriage of justice.' \"  Id. (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 731-38, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-80, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was no error, plain or otherwise, in Judge Wolf's instructions to the jury.

The Circuits have expressed conflicting views on the question.  The Ninth Circuit has held that &#167; 241 does not require proof of an overt act.  See United States v. Skillman, 922 F.2d 1370, 1375-76 (9th Cir.1991).  The Fifth Circuit has inconsistently stated both that &#167; 241 does not require an overt act, see United States v. Morado, 454 F.2d 167, 169 (5th Cir.1972), and that &#167; 241 does require proof of an overt act, see United States v. Greer, 939 F.2d 1076, 1099 (5th Cir.1991);  United States v. McKenzie, 768 F.2d 602, 606 (5th Cir.1985);  United States v. Kimble, 719 F.2d 1253, 1256 (5th Cir.1983).  In none of the Fifth Circuit cases, however, was the question a central issue in the case.  The Sixth Circuit has stated, also in dictum, that &#167; 241 does require proof of an overt act.  See United States v. Brown, 49 F.3d 1162, 1165 (6th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Circuit has never decided the question.  The Supreme Court case of United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 115 S.Ct. 382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994), we think, requires a holding that &#167; 241 contains no overt act requirement.  In Shabani, the Court found that there was no overt act requirement where the language of the drug conspiracy statute, there 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> did not require proof of an overt act, and the common law of conspiracy at the time the statute was enacted did not require an overt act.  Accord United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 155 (1st Cir.1989).  The Supreme Court noted that the language of the statute does not require \"that an overt act be committed to further the conspiracy, and [the Court has] not inferred such a requirement from congressional silence in other conspiracy statutes.\"  Shabani, 513 U.S. at 13, 115 S.Ct. at 384 (citing Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373, 378, 33 S.Ct. 780, 782, 57 L.Ed. 1232 (1913), holding that no overt act is required for conspiracy liability under the Sherman Act, and Singer v. United States, 323 U.S. 338, 340, 65 S.Ct. 282, 283-84, 89 L.Ed. 285 (1945), holding that no overt act is required for conspiracy liability under the Selective Service Act).  \"Nash and Singer follow the settled principle of statutory construction that, absent contrary indications, Congress intends to adopt the common law definition of statutory terms.\"  Shabani, 513 U.S. at 13, 115 S.Ct. at 384.   And, the Court continued, \"the common law understanding of conspiracy 'does not make the doing of any act other than the act of conspiring a condition of liability.' \"  Id. at 13-14, 115 S.Ct. at 384 (quoting Nash, 229 U.S. at 378, 33 S.Ct. at 782).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same analysis must apply to a construction of &#167; 241:  absent a showing of legislative intent to the contrary, we assume that Congress intended to adopt the common law understanding of conspiracy when it used the word \"conspire.\"   The legislative history of &#167; 241 reveals no contrary intent, and at common law \"it was neither necessary to aver nor prove an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"  Bannon v. United States, 156 U.S. 464, 468, 15 S.Ct. 467, 469, 39 L.Ed. 494 (1895), quoted in Shabani, 513 U.S. at 14, 115 S.Ct. at 384.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Shabani, the Court compared the language of the drug conspiracy statute, which contains no express overt act requirement, with the language of the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> which does contain an express overt act requirement.  The Court found this dichotomy \"instructive,\" noting that \"[i]n light of this additional element in the general conspiracy statute, Congress' silence in &#167; 846 speaks volumes.  After all, the general conspiracy statute preceded and presumably provided the framework for the more specific drug conspiracy statute.\"  Shabani, 513 U.S. at 14, 115 S.Ct. at 385.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, with its explicit overt act requirement, also preceded the enactment of &#167; 241.  The general conspiracy statute was originally enacted by Congress in 1867, 14 Stat. 484, Add. 25, and remains essentially unchanged today.  The civil rights conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241, was enacted in 1870, \"as part of what came to be known as the Enforcement Act of 1870,\" United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 801, 86 S.Ct. 1152, 1161, 16 L.Ed.2d 267 (1966) (footnote omitted), and also remains in substantially the same form today.  By the time it enacted what is now &#167; 241, Congress had, when it wanted to import an overt act requirement, made it explicit.  But Congress chose not to do so in &#167; 241.  We recognize, but are not persuaded by, a contrary argument that Congress, having placed the overt act requirement in the general conspiracy statute, felt it unnecessary to place such language in future conspiracy statutes although it fully intended the overt act requirement to apply.  This argument cannot be squared with the Shabani Court's interpretation of congressional silence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that Congress did not intend to require an overt act in &#167; 241 is bolstered by Supreme Court cases that have emphasized the breadth of &#167;&#167; 241 and 242, and the prosecutorial force that Congress intended to give them.  In Price, the Court discussed the history of &#167;&#167; 241 and 242.  The Court noted that the statutes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>must be viewed against the events and passions of the time.  The Civil War had ended in April 1865.  Relations between Negroes and whites were increasingly turbulent.  Congress had taken control of the entire governmental process in former Confederate States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the Congress pressures mounted in the period between the end of the war and 1870 for drastic measures....  On May 31, 1870, the Enforcement Act of 1870 [current &#167; 241] was enacted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, it is hardly conceivable that Congress intended &#167; 241 to apply only to a narrow and relatively unimportant category of rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 803-05, 86 S.Ct. at 1161-63 (footnotes omitted).  Although the Price Court's focus was on the rights that &#167; 241 protects and not on the existence of an overt act requirement, its discussion provides strong support for the proposition that the Reconstruction Era Congress did not intend &#167; 241 to have a narrow scope.  Given this backdrop, it is difficult to imagine that Congress could have intended a definition of conspiracy in &#167; 241 that was narrower than the common law definition of the term.  Were we to judicially import on overt act requirement, we would be narrowing the type of activity that Congress intended to reach when it enacted &#167; 241.

United States, 284 U.S. 390, 52 S.Ct. 189, 76 L.Ed. 356 (1932), that inconsistency of verdicts is not a basis for vacating a conviction, and rejecting any exceptions to the rule);  United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 41 (1st Cir.1991) (noting that \"the Supreme Court has made it clear that verdict inconsistency in itself is not a sufficient basis for vacating a conviction.\")  (citing U.S. v.

Count One of the indictment charged that Crochiere conspired with Lambert to violate Nieves's civil rights, while Count Two charged Crochiere with the actual act of violation--the pouring of the scalding liquid onto Nieves's lap.  A guilty verdict on Count Two would have required the jury to find that Crochiere himself poured the hot liquid on Nieves, and that Crochiere's actions \"result[ed] in bodily injury\" to Nieves.  The jury was not required to find either of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt to convict on the conspiracy count alone.  The jury could easily have concluded that there was not enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Crochiere was the individual who actually poured the scalding liquid onto Nieves's lap.  There was no eyewitness testimony regarding this act.  On the other hand, there was eyewitness testimony on the conspiracy count.  Lambert testified that he gave the cup of steaming water to Crochiere intending that the water be used to hurt Nieves.  There was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Crochiere was a willing participant, and harbored the same unlawful intent to punish Nieves.  Crochiere had previously asked Lambert for salt to rub into Nieves's bleeding forehead.  Croteau testified that he heard Crochiere say \"give me some of that\" to Lambert, and that moments later Crochiere walked past Croteau's cell with a cup of steaming water in the direction of Nieves's cell.  Robichaud testified that he saw this exchange occur between Lambert and Crochiere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, a jury could easily have found sufficient evidence for a conviction on the conspiracy count, and insufficient evidence for a conviction on the substantive count, without these different outcomes being logically inconsistent.  This analysis also disposes of Crochiere's claim that his motion for a judgment of acquittal should have been granted by the district court because the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilty on the conspiracy count.

Crochiere, a correctional officer at the Worcester County Jail and House of Correction, was indicted on charges of violating and conspiring to violate the civil rights of a pre-trial detainee at the jail.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2, 241, 242.  Crochiere was charged with the act of and conspiracy to pour boiling water on the groin and upper thigh of Jose Nieves, who had been arrested on the charges of murdering a young girl.

He challenges the district court's denial of his motion for a jury view of the scene of the crime.  He contends that a portion of the district court's jury instructions on the conspiracy count was erroneous in that the instructions charged that no \"overt act\" is required under the criminal civil rights conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241.  He also argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him on the conspiracy count.  We affirm and hold that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241, the civil rights conspiracy statute, does not require an overt act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We state the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict.  See United States v.

On April 18, 1993, Jose Nieves was brought to the jail to await trial on charges that he murdered a twelve year old girl.  Nieves, a heroin addict who was undergoing detoxification, became highly agitated and unruly, banging his head against the bars of his cell.  Nieves cut open his forehead.  Several correctional officers, Crochiere among them, came to Nieves's cell to restrain him.  The officers handcuffed Nieves and strapped him into a restraint chair.  Nieves strongly resisted;  the officers placed a blanket over Nieves's head to prevent him from spitting.  The first time the officers placed Nieves in the restraint chair, he was able to free himself from the arm straps.  The second attempt at restraint was more successful, and once Nieves was securely in the chair he was no longer a threat to himself or to the officers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rodney Lambert was another pre-trial detainee;  he was indicted on the same federal civil rights charges as Crochiere.  He pled guilty, cooperated with the government and testified against Crochiere.  His cell was located three cells down from Nieves's cell.  Lambert had a hot pot in his cell, and after Nieves was restrained and the commotion died down, Lambert began boiling water for soup.  Crochiere approached Lambert's cell and asked Lambert if he had any salt.  Crochiere wanted to rub salt into the open wound on Nieves's forehead.  Lambert said that he did not, but offered Crochiere an alternative weapon:  a cup of boiling water.  Crochiere initially declined the offer, but soon returned and requested the boiling liquid.  Lambert poured a cup of steaming water for Crochiere, who took the cup and walked toward Nieves's cell.  Moments later, Nieves screamed out in pain, exclaiming that \"[t]hey burned my pee pee,\" and that he was hurt.  Following these screams, another voice said, \"Now you know how the little girl felt.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the government's witnesses who testified to these events were Michael Robichaud, a correctional officer on duty on the evening of April 18, 1993;  Foimai Tau, a Unit Supervisor on duty the same evening;  and Scott Croteau, Anibal Antuna, and Rodney Lambert, three inmates whose cells were located in the same tier as Nieves's cell.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nieves complained to Officer Robichaud of pain in his groin.  Robichaud related this information to Lieutenant Tau, the Unit Supervisor.  Lieutenant Tau went to see Nieves, who asked to see a nurse because someone had poured hot water on him.  Lieutenant Tau summoned Nurse Elaine Gustafson, who spoke with Nieves but, being at the end of her shift, refused to examine him.  Nurse Dorothy Hester, the supervising nurse at the jail, did examine Nieves the following morning.  Because Nieves told her he had an injury in his groin area, she examined that area and observed a second-degree burn with blisters.  The burn extended down to his inner thigh area, and upwards to his testicles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 20, two days after the burning, Nieves was taken to Bridgewater State Hospital for a psychological examination as to his competence to stand trial for the charge of murder.  A correctional officer at Bridgewater State conducted a routine strip search of Nieves and observed blisters and injury in Nieves's groin area.  Pursuant to routine practice the officer photographed the injury, and the photograph was later sent, along with a report, to the Worcester County Sheriff's Office.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kevin Foley, Assistant Deputy Superintendent of the Worcester County Sheriff's Office, then commendably initiated an investigation of the burning.  Foley requested reports regarding Nieves's injury from several individuals, including Crochiere, Tau, and Gustafson.  All of them denied that Nieves had been burned, or that Nieves had complained of pain and of being burned by a correctional officer.  The following year, around September of 1994, the Federal Bureau of Investigations began an investigation into the events surrounding Nieves's injury, which, in turn, led to the prosecution of this case.  Nurse Gustafson and Supervisor Tau eventually testified that they had previously reported falsely on the events of April 18, 1993, and stated that Nieves actually did complain of pain in his groin and told them that he had been burned with hot water.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Jury View</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the second day of trial, Crochiere filed a motion for a jury view of the lower left tier of cells at the jail, the location of these events.  Crochiere argued that it was only by viewing the tier of cells that the jurors could properly assess the validity of the statements made by several of the witnesses --specifically inmates Croteau and Lambert--about what they saw and heard on that night.  The district judge initially deferred the decision on the view, so that he could hear more of the evidence and \"have a better sense of whether a view [would be] important and worthwhile in the context of the case.\"   The court ultimately denied the view, reasoning that it would be \"not just an unnecessary use of time, but actually potentially confusing and misleading, because neither Croteau nor Lambert said that they could see anybody going into Nieves's cell or see anything that was going on in the cell.\"The decision to permit a view is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.  See United States v. Pettiford, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"582530\"><a href=\"/opinion/582530/united-states-v-brian-a-pettiford/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.1992);  United States v. Passos-Paternina, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551470\"><a href=\"/opinion/551470/united-states-v-emiro-miguel-passos-paternina-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span>, 986 (1st Cir.1990).  A court generally acts within that discretion in denying a motion for a view when there is sufficient evidence describing the scene in the form of testimony, diagrams, or photographs.  See Pettiford, 962 F.2d at 76;  United States v. Drougas, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"444351\"><a href=\"/opinion/444351/united-states-v-aristedes-drougas-united-states-of-america-v-michael-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">748</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1984).  In making this determination, the court may consider such factors as the orderliness of the trial, whether the jury would be confused or misled, whether it would be time-consuming or logistically difficult, and whether cross-examination had been permitted regarding the details of the scene.  See id.;  Pettiford, 962 F.2d at 76;  Passos-Paternina, 918 F.2d at 986;  Bundy v. Dugger, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508475\"><a href=\"/opinion/508475/theodore-robert-bundy-v-richard-l-dugger-secretary-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1402</span></a></span>, 1422 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crochiere made a non-frivolous argument in support of the view as to the events in Nieves's cell which underlay the violation of civil rights charge, as opposed to the conspiracy charge.  Inmates Croteau and Lambert did at times testify to having been able to see beyond what was happening in front of their own cells.  For example, Lambert testified that he could see officers walking into and out of Nieves's cell, and that he could see Crochiere \"in front of one of the cells to [his] right.\"   The evidence in this case was somewhat inconsistent, and the credibility of each witness's story as to what he saw and when he saw it was critical.  The average juror has not seen a jail cell block, and might well have difficulty understanding the layout and the ability (or inability) of inmates to see up and down the corridor where Nieves's cell was located.  Crochiere contended that photographs and charts could not do adequate justice to the layout and spacial arrangements of the cell block.  Cf. Pettiford, 962 F.2d at 76 (upholding denial of view where view would not have provided clearer portrayal of scene than photographs did).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also true, as the district judge noted, that neither Croteau nor Lambert testified that they could see into Nieves's cell.  Most of the inmates' testimony was of what they heard, and what they saw happen in front of their own cells.  A view would not have helped to discredit this testimony.  Additionally, the defendant had ample opportunity to cross-examine the various government witnesses on their ability to perceive what they claimed to see.  The question of the view was not an easy one, and the district judge's decision was considered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the acquittal on the substantive civil rights charge, we need not decide the question of whether there was an abuse of discretion in denying the view.  Any error Crochiere may claim in this ruling was harmless.  \"In the usual case, a non-constitutional evidentiary error will be treated as harmless if it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\"   See United States v. Rose, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197184\"><a href=\"/opinion/197184/united-states-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1408</span></a></span>, 1414 (1st Cir.1997).  The government bears the burden of persuasion in a harmless error analysis.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The view was relevant primarily to the substantive &#167; 242 Count, of which Crochiere was acquitted, and not to the conspiracy count.  The evidence was more than adequate to support the conspiracy count that Crochiere took boiling water from Lambert after saying he wanted a way to hurt Nieves.  View or no view, Lambert plainly was competent to testify about what he did in his own cell and what he and Crochiere said there.  Inmate Croteau also testified that he saw Crochiere walk past his cell in the direction of Lambert's cell, which was directly to the left of Croteau's cell.  Croteau stated that he then heard Crochiere say to Lambert, \"Can I get some of that?\" and then observed Crochiere walk past Croteau's cell again, in the direction of Nieves's cell, this time carrying a cup of steaming liquid.  A view would not have undercut any of this testimony, all directly relevant to the conspiracy count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crochiere argues that the view was relevant to the conspiracy count because it directly implicated the witnesses' credibility.  Although a view might have had some indirect impact on the jury's assessment of witness credibility, Crochiere had ample opportunity to, and did, impeach the witnesses' credibility in a variety of ways at trial.  The jury nevertheless chose to believe the evidence supporting the conspiracy count, and a view was unlikely to have altered this outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Jury Instructions:  Overt Acts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crochiere argues that the district court gave erroneous jury instructions on the elements of a conspiracy under &#167; 241, because the court stated that the government was not required to prove the existence of an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.  Crochiere did not submit any proposed instructions on &#167; 241, nor did he object to the absence of an overt act instruction when specifically questioned on this issue by the district judge.  In these circumstances, the standard of review is plain error.  See United States v. Alzanki, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196113\"><a href=\"/opinion/196113/united-states-v-alzanki/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span>, 1003 (1st Cir.1995).  Under this standard, the burden rests with Crochiere to establish that \"the error was 'clear,' in the sense that it was 'obvious,' that it affected 'substantial rights,' and that failure to vacate [the conviction] would result in a 'miscarriage of justice.' \"  Id.

The Court found this dichotomy \"instructive,\" noting that \"[i]n light of this additional element in the general conspiracy statute, Congress' silence in &#167; 846 speaks volumes.  After all, the general conspiracy statute preceded and presumably provided the framework for the more specific drug conspiracy statute.\"  Shabani, 513 U.S. at 14, 115 S.Ct. at 385.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371, with its explicit overt act requirement, also preceded the enactment of &#167; 241.  The general conspiracy statute was originally enacted by Congress in 1867, 14 Stat. 484, Add. 25, and remains essentially unchanged today.  The civil rights conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 241, was enacted in 1870, \"as part of what came to be known as the Enforcement Act of 1870,\" United States v. Price, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107202\"><a href=\"/opinion/107202/united-states-v-price/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">787</span></a></span>, 801, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107202\"><a href=\"/opinion/107202/united-states-v-price/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

By the time it enacted what is now &#167; 241, Congress had, when it wanted to import an overt act requirement, made it explicit.  But Congress chose not to do so in &#167; 241.  We recognize, but are not persuaded by, a contrary argument that Congress, having placed the overt act requirement in the general conspiracy statute, felt it unnecessary to place such language in future conspiracy statutes although it fully intended the overt act requirement to apply.  This argument cannot be squared with the Shabani Court's interpretation of congressional silence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that Congress did not intend to require an overt act in &#167; 241 is bolstered by Supreme Court cases that have emphasized the breadth of &#167;&#167; 241 and 242, and the prosecutorial force that Congress intended to give them.  In Price, the Court discussed the history of &#167;&#167; 241 and 242.  The Court noted that the statutes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>must be viewed against the events and passions of the time.  The Civil War had ended in April 1865.  Relations between Negroes and whites were increasingly turbulent.  Congress had taken control of the entire governmental process in former Confederate States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within the Congress pressures mounted in the period between the end of the war and 1870 for drastic measures....  On May 31, 1870, the Enforcement Act of 1870 [current &#167; 241] was enacted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, it is hardly conceivable that Congress intended &#167; 241 to apply only to a narrow and relatively unimportant category of rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 803-05, 86 S.Ct. at 1161-63 (footnotes omitted).  Although the Price Court's focus was on the rights that &#167; 241 protects and not on the existence of an overt act requirement, its discussion provides strong support for the proposition that the Reconstruction Era Congress did not intend &#167; 241 to have a narrow scope.  Given this backdrop, it is difficult to imagine that Congress could have intended a definition of conspiracy in &#167; 241 that was narrower than the common law definition of the term.  Were we to judicially import on overt act requirement, we would be narrowing the type of activity that Congress intended to reach when it enacted &#167; 241.

Count One of the indictment charged that Crochiere conspired with Lambert to violate Nieves's civil rights, while Count Two charged Crochiere with the actual act of violation--the pouring of the scalding liquid onto Nieves's lap.  A guilty verdict on Count Two would have required the jury to find that Crochiere himself poured the hot liquid on Nieves, and that Crochiere's actions \"result[ed] in bodily injury\" to Nieves.  The jury was not required to find either of these elements beyond a reasonable doubt to convict on the conspiracy count alone.  The jury could easily have concluded that there was not enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Crochiere was the individual who actually poured the scalding liquid onto Nieves's lap.  There was no eyewitness testimony regarding this act.  On the other hand, there was eyewitness testimony on the conspiracy count.  Lambert testified that he gave the cup of steaming water to Crochiere intending that the water be used to hurt Nieves.  There was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Crochiere was a willing participant, and harbored the same unlawful intent to punish Nieves.  Crochiere had previously asked Lambert for salt to rub into Nieves's bleeding forehead.  Croteau testified that he heard Crochiere say \"give me some of that\" to Lambert, and that moments later Crochiere walked past Croteau's cell with a cup of steaming water in the direction of Nieves's cell.  Robichaud testified that he saw this exchange occur between Lambert and Crochiere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, a jury could easily have found sufficient evidence for a conviction on the conspiracy count, and insufficient evidence for a conviction on the substantive count, without these different outcomes being logically inconsistent.  This analysis also disposes of Crochiere's claim that his motion for a judgment of acquittal should have been granted by the district court because the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of guilty on the conspiracy count.
