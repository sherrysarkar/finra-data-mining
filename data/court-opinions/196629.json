Defendant Donald  Roy  contends that  the\r                            \r\n\ndistrict court erred in failing  to make a downward departure\r\n\nunder    5K2.13 of  the United  States Sentencing  Guidelines\r\n\n(for  diminished capacity) and  under U.S.S.G.    5K2.16 (for\r\n\nvoluntary disclosure).   Roy's failure to request  a downward\r\n\ndeparture  under  either  section   in  the  district   court\r\n\nforecloses  our consideration of the issue.

Ct. 1806 (1995).\r\n\n     To   the  extent  Roy   is  arguing  that   he  received\r\n\nineffective assistance  of counsel because  his attorney  did\r\n\nnot  move  for  a  departure  under      5K2.13,  5K2.16, the\r\n\nargument  is without  merit,  for there  was  scant, if  any,\r\n\nevidentiary support for  a departure.  To the  extent Roy may\r\n\nbe  premising an  ineffective assistance  claim on  counsel's\r\n\nfailure adequately to develop the  record, the matter is  not\r\n\npresently reviewable.
