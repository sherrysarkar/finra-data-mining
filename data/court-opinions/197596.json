Claimant Ramon Torres-Gonzalez appeals from\r\n\na  district court  judgment  directing  that  four  items  of\r\n\njewelry   be  forfeited  as   proceeds  of  his  drug-related\r\n\nactivity.  See 21 U.S.C.    881(a)(6).  As claimant concedes,\r                          \r\n\nthe  sole issue squarely presented below--that the forfeiture\r\n\nproceeding  constituted   a  second  form  of  punishment  in\r\n\nviolation  of double  jeopardy--is now  defunct  in light  of\r\n\nUnited States  v. Ursery,  116 S.  Ct. 2135  (1996).   He has\r                                    \r\n\naccordingly shifted gears on appeal and advanced a variety of\r\n\narguments involving, inter  alia, due process and  the Fourth\r                                            \r\n\nAmendment. \r\n\n     None of these contentions is properly before us.   While\r\n\nclaimant   is  correct  that   several  were  set   forth  as\r\n\naffirmative defenses  below, they  were never  pursued.   The\r\n\nnumber of claims was narrowed  at the November 8, 1995 status\r\n\nconference.   And in  response to the  court's directive that\r\n\nthose  remaining  issues  be  briefed,  claimant submitted  a\r\n\npleading  confined to  his  double-jeopardy contention.   All\r\n\nother  claims, including those he now presses on appeal, were\r\n\nthereby waived. \r\n\n     A  review of  claimant's arguments  reveals  them to  be\r\n\nwithout merit in  any event.  Absent any  allegation that the\r\n\nforfeiture action was filed outside the applicable statute of\r\n\nlimitations,  his complaints of  administrative delay fail in\r\n\nlight  of United States  v. James Daniel  Good Real Property,\r                                                                        \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n510  U.S. 43, 62-65  (1993).  His  Fourth Amendment argument,\r\n\neven if  not waived  as a  result of  his plea agreement,  is\r\n\nnegated  by  the uncontested  facts  on record.    His prompt\r\n\nresponse  to the  forfeiture complaint  belies  any claim  of\r\n\ninadequate  notice.  To the extent  claimant is disputing the\r\n\nexistence  of   probable  cause   for  the  forfeiture,   the\r\n\ngovernment's pleadings  established an ample  basis therefor.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  Dock. #  19.  Finally,  the district  court acted\r                     \r\n\nwell within its  discretion in declining to  review arguments\r\n\nadvanced  for the first time in claimant's Rule 59(e) motion.\r\n\nSee,  e.g., Jorge  Rivera  Surillo &amp;  Co.  v.
