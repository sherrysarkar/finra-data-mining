Their arrests\r\n\nand  convictions were  the result  of an extended  undercover and\r\n\nsurveillance  operation  conducted  by   law  enforcement  agents\r\n\nseeking to  discover the source  of an increased heroin  trade in\r\n\nPortland, Maine.   Each defendant was convicted  of participating\r\n\nin a  conspiracy to  possess  and distribute  heroin and  various\r\n\nother crimes.   They  appeal, questioning  their convictions  and\r\n\ntheir sentences.  We AFFIRM the convictions and sentences.\r\n\n                         FACTUAL SUMMARY\r                                   FACTUAL SUMMARY\r\n\n          The  following  factual  synopsis  summarizes  evidence\r\n\nintroduced at trial.   The facts  are resolved in the  light most\r\n\nfavorable to  the verdict and  consistent with the record,  as is\r\n\nrequired by our  standard of  review in  an appeal  from a  final\r\n\njudgment of  conviction. U.S.  v. Maraj, 947  F.2d 520,  522 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1991).\r\n\n          Between July 8,  1994 and August 23,  1994, Agent Scott\r\n\nPelletier of  the Maine Drug  Enforcement Agency engaged  in four\r\n\nheroin transactions  with a man  named Pablo, later proved  to be\r\n\nMario M ndez.  Pelletier had been introduced to Pablo by Lawrence\r\n\nFreeman,  a   cooperating  government  informant   familiar  with\r\n\nregional drug trade.  Each of the four transactions took place in\r\n\nLowell, Massachusetts,  where all  four defendants  resided.   In\r\n\neach transaction Pelletier  purchased between 50 and  500 bags of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nheroin  from Pablo.   During  the course  of these  transactions,\r\n\nPelletier saw Gonz lez accompanying  and assisting M ndez several\r\n\ntimes and witnessed Segura conducting counter-surveillance at two\r\n\ndifferent  locations  on  July  8,   1994.    After  the   fourth\r\n\ntransaction between Pelletier and  M ndez, which took place at  a\r\n\nresidence located  at 36  Park Street,  law enforcement  officers\r\n\nbegan  arresting individuals involved.  Gonz lez was found hiding\r\n\nnear the Merrimack River, and M ndez was arrested outside 36 Park\r\n\nStreet, later shown to be the location of the heroin \"store\" that\r\n\nthe conspiracy operated.\r\n\n          The  police  then  executed a  search  warrant  for 173\r\n\nUniversity  Avenue,  also  in Lowell,  Massachusetts.    Based on\r\n\nextensive  surveillance   and  investigation  the   officers  had\r\n\nidentified numerous phone  calls between the residence  of M ndez\r\n\nand  173 University  Avenue and  between 36  Park Street  and 173\r\n\nUniversity.   Upon entering  the apartment  they observed  Segura\r\n\nrunning from  the bathroom  where plastic  bags containing  white\r\n\npowder were going  down the toilet.  Also,  within 173 University\r\n\nAvenue, the officers  seized numerous items of  drug distribution\r\n\nparaphernalia, including scales, sieves, and a \"No Way Out\" stamp\r\n\nused for labeling the type  of heroin purchased by Pelletier from\r\n\nM ndez.   They also found a large amount  of cash, 107.6 grams of\r\n\ncrack cocaine and a loaded .357 Magnum handgun.\r\n\n          Police next executed  a search warrant  at 205 and  203\r\n\nUniversity  Avenue  where  they  arrested   George  Berr os,  the\r\n\nresident.   There the  officers seized  large amounts  of heroin,\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncrack  cocaine, and  various  items  identified  as  distribution\r\n\nparaphernalia  and  found  a notebook  containing  the  telephone\r\n\nnumber for 173 University Avenue.\r\n\n          Other  evidence  at  trial  included the  testimony  of\r\n\nChristopher  Coughlin, who admitted  purchasing heroin  and crack\r\n\nfrom  the defendants.  Coughlin identified  M ndez  as Pablo  and\r\n\nGonz lez as a man who  participated in the transactions but whose\r\n\nname he did not know.\r\n\n           After  a nineteen  day  trial,  the  jury  returned  a\r\n\nverdict convicting each  defendant of various counts  of the nine\r\n\ncount  indictment.   All  appellants were  convicted of  Count I,\r\n\nwhich  charged  that   the  defendants  had  participated   in  a\r\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute\r\n\nheroin in violation  of 21 U.S.C.    846.  After  considering the\r\n\npresentencing  report of  probation  officers,  as  well  as  the\r\n\nobjections  of both  parties to  the  report, the  district court\r\n\nsentenced the four defendant to various prison terms ranging from\r\n\n84 months for Berr os to 151 months for M ndez.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          We  have considered the arguments of each defendant and\r\n\nfind no error in their convictions or sentences.  Accordingly, we\r\n\naffirm.   Because each  individual raises different  and numerous\r\n\nissues and  each is  represented by  different  counsel, we  will\r\n\naddress  the contentions of  each defendant separately  with some\r\n\nnecessary repetition.\r\n\n                            I.  M ndez\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          M ndez  was convicted  of  Counts  I-V,  consisting  of\r\n\nvarious  charges relating to possession and conspiracy to possess\r\n\nheroin  and  cocaine with  the  intent  to  distribute.   He  was\r\n\nsentenced  to  151  months  for  each  conviction  to  be  served\r\n\nconcurrently.     The  sentence   was  the   result  of   several\r\n\nenhancements  which M ndez  contests  and a  significant downward\r\n\ndeparture.  The  district court explained the  downward departure\r\n\nby noting  that the lengthy  sentences for possession  of cocaine\r\n\nbase  (crack)   were  unjustified  because  the   conspiracy  was\r\n\nprimarily one to distribute heroin  rather than crack.  The court\r\n\nfound that, by including the amount of confiscated  crack cocaine\r\n\nin the sentencing calculation, the sentence of each defendant was\r\n\nincreased by as much as six  levels.  The court acknowledged that\r\n\nits  reason could  be  construed  as  a  discouraged  ground  for\r\n\ndeparture but found  that the case fell  out of the  heartland of\r\n\nprescribed  conduct, thus  warranting departure.   This  downward\r\n\ndeparture is not  questioned by the government;  therefore, we do\r\n\nnot reach whether it  was proper.  The  departure resulted in  an\r\n\noffense  level of 35  for M ndez.  Based  on his criminal history\r\n\ncategory he received a 151 month sentence.\r\n\n          We affirm M ndez's convictions and sentences.\r\n\n             A.  Testimony of defense witness Fortin\r\n\n          M ndez contends that his  conviction should be reversed\r\n\nbecause he was precluded  from offering the testimony  of Loretta\r\n\nFortin.  The essence of her testimony would have been that M ndez\r\n\nwas not the \"Pablo\" she was  introduced to during a drug sale  in\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nJune of 1994.   Furthermore, M ndez called Fortin  to discuss her\r\n\nmeeting  with Special  Agent  Connick in  August of  1994, during\r\n\nwhich  she  identified  the photograph  of  another  defendant as\r\n\nPablo.   The relevancy  of this testimony  is that  an individual\r\n\nnamed Pablo  was the  supposed leader of  the conspiracy  and the\r\n\ndealer with  whom the  government initially  dealt.   Differences\r\n\nexisted as to which member  of the conspiracy was actually Pablo,\r\n\nbut several witnesses testified that M ndez was in fact Pablo and\r\n\nthat M ndez carried a beeper with the number belonging to Pablo.\r\n\n          The  substance of  Loretta Fortin's  proposed testimony\r\n\nwas that she had one meeting  with Pablo in which he entered  the\r\n\nback  seat  of her  car while  she  remained in  the front.   Her\r\n\nhusband introduced  the man as  Pablo, and they conducted  a drug\r\n\ntransaction.  Fortin  was willing to testify that  M ndez was not\r\n\nthe Pablo that  entered her car and that she selected a different\r\n\ndefendant as Pablo  from police photographs.  The  court excluded\r\n\nthis testimony because  it was based on  the inadmissable hearsay\r\n\nof the  introduction of  Pablo by her  husband.   M ndez contends\r\n\nthat  this  exclusion  was  erroneous  because  Federal  Rule  of\r\n\nEvidence 801(d)(1)(c) provides that if a witness is available for\r\n\ncross examination,  prior statements  of  identification are  not\r\n\nhearsay.   This assertion  misses the  point.   Fortin's proposed\r\n\ntestimony about her  husband's introduction of Pablo  created the\r\n\nhearsay problem, not her prior identification statements to Agent\r\n\nConnick.  To  make her testimony  credible she had to  admit that\r\n\nher  knowledge  of Pablo's  identity  was  based on  the  hearsay\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nstatement of her husband - \"this is Pablo.\"\r\n\n          By  echoing   her  husband's  introduction   of  Pablo,\r\n\nFortin's proposed  testimony meets the prerequisites  of hearsay.\r\n\nThe  introduction  of  Pablo  is  a statement  not  made  by  the\r\n\ndeclarant in testimony  offered to prove the truth  of the matter\r\n\nasserted.    For Loretta  Fortin's  testimony to  be  tenable the\r\n\nstatement made by her  husband must have been  true.  Because  we\r\n\nhave  no  way  of  verifying that  Mr.  Fortin  was  sufficiently\r\n\nfamiliar with Pablo to identify him to Mrs. Fortin, her testimony\r\n\nabout Pablo is classic hearsay and was properly excluded.\r\n\n          Accordingly,  the  district   court  did  not  err   in\r\n\ndisallowing  Fortin's testimony on hearsay grounds.  Moreover, if\r\n\nerror, it would have been harmless.  Even if the introduction was\r\n\nnot hearsay, given  Fortin's limited interaction with  Pablo, the\r\n\nweight  of her  testimony  could  not  overcome  the  substantial\r\n\ntestimony of other  credible witnesses who had more  contact with\r\n\nM ndez/Pablo and  who testified  that M ndez  was in  fact Pablo.\r\n\nSee U.S. v. Southard,  700 F.2d 1, 21  (1st Cir. 1983)  (harmless\r                              \r\n\nerror  to improperly exclude admissible evidence as hearsay where\r\n\nsubstantial evidence existed to convict defendant).\r\n\n       B.  M ndez' sentence was based on acquitted conduct\r\n\n          M ndez also challenges  the fact that his  sentence was\r\n\nbased  in part  on acquitted  conduct.  Specifically,  he asserts\r\n\nthat the crack cocaine seized  by the officers during the arrests\r\n\nshould not have  been considered for sentencing  purposes because\r\n\nhe   was  acquitted  on   all  counts  involving   possession  or\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\ndistribution of cocaine.  This  assertion has no merit because \"a\r\n\njury's verdict of acquittal does not prevent the sentencing court\r\n\nfrom considering conduct underlying the acquitted charge, so long\r\n\nas  that  conduct has  been  proved  by  a preponderance  of  the\r\n\nevidence.\"  U.S. v. Watts, 117 S. Ct. 633, 638 (1997).\r                                   \r\n\n               C.  Enhancement of M ndez' sentence\r\n\n            I.  M ndez' role as an organizer or leader\r                                                                \r\n\n          The evidence  was not  insufficient to support  M ndez'\r\n\nfour-level  enhancement  as   an  organizer  or  leader   of  the\r\n\nconspiracy as provided  by U.S.S.G    3B1.1(a).   Evidence showed\r\n\nthat M ndez was always the person contacted when heroin was to be\r\n\npurchased,  and that  he always  returned  pager calls.   He  set\r\n\nprices  and   determined  the  location   of  the   transactions.\r\n\nWitnesses testified  that it  appeared that  men who  accompanied\r\n\nM ndez were his  subordinates and that he  hired a person  to man\r\n\nthe heroin \"store\" at 36 Park Street from 9:00 a.m. to  6:00 p.m.\r\n\ndaily.  Other evidence offered by the government in its objection\r\n\nto the  presentence report tended  to suggest that M ndez  was in\r\n\nfact  the leader of  a conspiracy that consisted  of five or more\r\n\nindividuals.\r\n\n          We will not  reverse a district court's finding of fact\r\n\nregarding  the  role  of  the  defendant  unless  it  is  clearly\r\n\nerroneous or based  on a mistake of  law.  U.S. v. Cali,  87 F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n571,  574 (1st  Cir.  1996).   Based  on  the extensive  evidence\r\n\noffered at  trial and to the sentencing  court that M ndez was in\r\n\nfact  an  organizer  and  a  leader, we  hold  that  the  court's\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nsentencing was not clearly erroneous.\r\n\n         ii.  Transacting of drug sales in a school zone\r                                                                  \r\n\n          M ndez   questions   his  one-level   enhancement   for\r\n\ntransacting a  drug sale  in a  school zone  on  the ground  that\r\n\nevidence of the proximity of a school to any drug transaction was\r\n\nnot introduced at trial.  However, the record indicates that such\r\n\nevidence was  introduced at  the sentencing hearing  and was  not\r\n\nobjected to by any defendant.  The evidence supporting the school\r\n\nzone  enhancement consisted  of an  affidavit  signed by  Special\r\n\nAgent Bruce  Tavers stating  that the  drug transactions  at Fort\r\n\nHill Park in Lowell, Massachusetts took place within one thousand\r\n\nfeet of a junior high school.\r\n\n          At a sentencing hearing the court may consider evidence\r\n\nthat would  be inadmissable  at trial so  long as  the sentencing\r\n\ncourt determines that the  evidence has a \"sufficient  indicia of\r\n\nreliability  to support its probable accuracy.\"  U.S. v. Tardiff,\r                                                                          \r\n\n969  F.2d 1283,  1287 (1st Cir.  1992).   The affidavit of  a law\r\n\nenforcement   officer  familiar  with  the  locale  of  the  drug\r\n\ntransaction and  the  surrounding area  is sufficiently  reliable\r\n\nthat a court  can accept it as evidence  for sentencing purposes.\r\n\nM ndez  did  not object to  this evidence, and  we find no  plain\r\n\nerror.  The  affidavit was properly admitted to  support the one-\r\n\nlevel school zone enhancement.\r\n\n           iii.  Codefendant's possession of a firearm\r                                                                \r\n\n          M ndez'  two-level  enhancement  for  possession  of  a\r\n\nfirearm during the  drug offense was not error  although he never\r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nactually  possessed  or  used  a  gun  during  any  of  the  drug\r\n\ntransactions.  He  was arrested at a different  locale from where\r\n\nthe gun was found,  but evidence  showed that he was seen exiting\r\n\nthe  residence where  the gun  was found,  that he had  made many\r\n\ncalls  to this residence, that the residents were coconspirators,\r\n\nand  that the  residence was  a  center for  the drug  operation.\r\n\nThese  facts are  sufficient  for  the  enhancement  because  the\r\n\nsentencing guidelines require  only that a gun  be present during\r\n\nsome  portion of  an ongoing crime.  See U.S.S.G.    2D1.1(b)(1),\r                                                  \r\n\ncommentary at  n.3.  Because  the defendants were convicted  of a\r                    \r\n\ncontinuing conspiracy the firearm was present during the crime.\r\n\n          Once  the   presence   of  a   weapon  is   established\r\n\nenhancement is  proper unless the  defendant demonstrates special\r\n\ncircumstances that show a clear improbability that the weapon was\r\n\nconnected to the drug  offense.  U.S. v. Lagasse, 87  F.3d 18, 22\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).   The government offered proof that the  gun was\r\n\npresent during  the drug  conspiracy, and  the defendant  did not\r\n\noffer  any special circumstances  that would make  the connection\r\n\nbetween   the  gun  and  the  crime  improbable;  therefore,  the\r\n\nenhancement was proper.1\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  M ndez mentions Bailey v.

See U.S. v.\r                                                                        \r\nGary, 74 F.3d 304,  317 n.11 (1st Cir.), cert denied,  116 S.

Bailey only restricted convictions under  18 U.S.C.\r                              \r\n   924(c)(1)  to  those  instances  where  a  defendant  actively\r\nemployed a firearm during the offense. Bailey, 116 S. Ct. at 508-\r                                                       \r\n9(recognizing that sentencing guidelines may provide enhancements\r\nfor mere possession of a firearm during other offenses).\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n                          II.  Gonz lez\r\n\n          Pedro Gonz lez  was convicted of  Counts I,  IV, and  V\r\n\nconsisting  of   various  charges  relating  to   possession  and\r\n\nconspiracy to possess  heroin with intent to distribute.   He was\r\n\nsentenced to  135 months  concurrent for  each  conviction.   His\r\n\noriginal  sentence was calculated  by his being  held responsible\r\n\nfor  113.7  grams of  crack  cocaine  and  307 grams  of  heroin,\r\n\nresulting  in a base  offense level of  33.  He was  then given a\r\n\ntwo-level adjustment for  obstruction of justice for  providing a\r\n\nfalse name and  personal history and a  two-level enhancement for\r\n\npossession  of a  firearm  during  a  drug  trafficking  offense,\r\n\nresulting  in a  total offense level  of 37.   The district court\r\n\ndeparted    downward  four  levels  because  it  found  that  the\r\n\nconspiracy  was primarily for  the distribution of  heroin rather\r\n\nthan crack  cocaine.   Because he found  that the  crack offenses\r\n\nwere  outside   the  heartland  offenses  under   the  applicable\r\n\nguideline, he granted a  four-level downward departure, resulting\r\n\nin a new  base offense level of  33.  After the  court considered\r\n\nhis criminal history category, he  was sentenced to 108 months in\r\n\nprison.  We affirm his sentence.\r\n\n              A. Obstruction of justice enhancement\r\n\n          Gonz lez contends that  he did not deserve  a two-level\r\n\nenhancement  for   obstruction  of  justice  because   the  false\r\n\nstatements  he  made concerning  his identity  did not  amount to\r\n\nmaterially false  information as  required by  U.S.S.G.    3C1.1.\r\n\nSection  3C1.1  provides   that  a  two  level   enhancement  for\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nobstruction  is  proper  where a  defendant  provides \"materially\r\n\nfalse information\" to a judge, magistrate or a probation officer.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    3C1.1, commentary at  n.3(f)&amp;(h).  For information to\r                                       \r\n\nbe material it need only have  the potential to affect the  issue\r\n\nunder determination, including incarceration period, condition of\r\n\nrelease, or whether  the wrongful conduct  has been mitigated  in\r\n\nsome way. U.S.S.G.   3C1.1, commentary at n.5; U.S. v. Kelley, 76\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d 436, 441 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n          By offering  a false name, date of  birth, and personal\r\n\nhistory throughout the trial and during sentencing Gonz lez hid a\r\n\nprior conviction,  his age, his  residence, and the fact  that he\r\n\nwas  seeking to defraud immigration officials by participating in\r\n\na sham  marriage for the  purpose of obtaining citizenship.   The\r\n\nsubstance and nature of these misrepresentations are material for\r\n\ntheir potential to affect sentencing determinations.  Because the\r\n\nfalsehoods \"could have  impacted the decisions of  the sentencing\r\n\ncourt\" the two-level  enhancement for obstruction of  justice was\r\n\nproper.  Kelley, 76 F.3d at 441.\r                         \r\n\n    B. Failure to prove the substance found was crack cocaine\r\n\n          The government  did not fail  to sustain its  burden of\r\n\nproving  that the substance  confiscated from the  conspiracy was\r\n\nactually  crack cocaine rather  than some other  form of cocaine.\r\n\nGonz lez did  not argue at trial that the substance may have been\r\n\nsome other form of cocaine than crack, thus we would have to find\r\n\nplain  error.   We cannot  find  plain error  unless the  desired\r\n\nfactual  finding is  the  only one  rationally  supported by  the\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nrecord below. See U.S. v.  Olivier-D az, 13 F.3d 1, 12  (1st Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1993).    Gonz lez did  not  offer  any  evidence to  combat  the\r\n\ngovernment' assertion that the substance  was crack.  Only if the\r\n\nrecord clearly  showed  that the  substance could  not have  been\r\n\ncrack would we be justified in finding plain error.  Id.  Because\r                                                                 \r\n\nthe record supports  the district court's finding  for sentencing\r\n\npurposes, there was no plain error.\r\n\n              C.  Ineffective assistance of counsel\r\n\n          Nothing in the record supports Gonz lez' assertion that\r\n\nhe was denied  effective assistance of counsel  when his attorney\r\n\nadvised  him that  he  could  not receive  a  lesser sentence  by\r\n\npleading guilty  to the crime.   \"We have held  with a regularity\r\n\nbordering  on   the  monotonous  that   fact-specific  claims  of\r\n\nineffective assistance cannot  make their debut on  direct review\r\n\nof    criminal  convictions,  but,  rather,  must  originally  be\r\n\npresented to,  and acted upon by, the trial  court.\"  See U.S. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMala, 7 F.3d 1058,  1062-63 (1st Cir  1993); U.S. v. McGill,  952\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\n\n            Since  claims  of  ineffective assistance\r\n            involve a binary  analysis--the defendant\r\n            must   show,     first,  that   counsel's\r\n            performance      was     constitutionally\r\n            deficient   and,   second,     that   the\r\n            deficient   performance  prejudiced   the\r\n            defense,  such  claims  typically require\r\n            the  resolution  of factual  issues  that\r\n            cannot  efficaciously be addressed in the\r\n            first instance by  an appellate tribunal.\r\n            In addition,  the  trial judge, by reason\r\n            of his  familiarity  with  the  case,  is\r\n            usually in the   best position to  assess\r\n            both   the    quality   of    the   legal\r\n            representation afforded  to the defendant\r\n            in the  district court and the  impact of\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\n            any  shortfall in  that   representation.\r\n            Under ideal  circumstances, the  court of\r\n            appeals should have   the benefit of this\r\n            evaluation;    elsewise,  the  court,  in\r\n            effect, may be playing  blindman's buff.\r\n\nMala,  7 F.3d  at 1062-63  (citation  omitted).   This court  has\r              \r\n\ndismissed without  prejudice portions of an appeal relating to an\r\n\nineffective  assistance claim  and  suggested that  the defendant\r\n\nshould litigate such a claim through the medium of an application\r\n\nfor post-conviction relief.  See  Mala, 7 F.3d at 1063.   Because\r                                                \r\n\nwe have no factual record upon which to judge Gonz lez' claims of\r\n\nineffective assistance, we reject this  claim for now and suggest\r\n\nthat the  proper forum for  his claim is through  application for\r\n\npost-conviction relief.\r\n\n                          III.  Berr os\r\n\n          George Berr os was convicted  of Counts I, VI, and  VII\r\n\nconsisting  of  various  charges   relating  to  possession   and\r\n\nconspiracy  to  possess   heroin  and  cocaine  with   intent  to\r\n\ndistribute.   He was  sentenced to 84  months concurrently.   His\r\n\noriginal sentence was  calculated by holding him  responsible for\r\n\n26.08  grams of  crack  cocaine  and 307  grams  of heroin  which\r\n\nresulted in a base offense level of 30.  He was then given a two-\r\n\nlevel adjustment for obstruction of justice for providing a false\r\n\nname and personal history, resulting  in a total offense level of\r\n\n32.   The  court then  departed downward  between three  and four\r\n\nlevels  based on  reasoning discussed  previously concerning  the\r\n\nnature  of the conspiracy.   After consideration  of his criminal\r\n\nhistory category, Berr os was sentenced to 84 months.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          Berr os questions both his conviction and sentence.  We\r\n\naffirm both.\r\n\n                 A.  Sufficiency of the evidence\r\n\n          Berr os   argues  that   the  evidence   presented  was\r\n\ninsufficient to sustain his  conviction for conspiracy.  He  says\r\n\nthat the government presented no  evidence that he assented to be\r\n\na part  of the  conspiracy or participated  in the  conspiracy to\r\n\ndistribute  heroin.   We  customarily  must  decide  whether  the\r\n\nevidence,    considered  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the\r\n\ngovernment  -  \"a perspective  that  requires  us to  draw  every\r\n\nplausible inference in line with the verdict and to resolve every\r\n\ncredibility  conflict  in the  same  fashion\"  -  would  allow  a\r\n\nrational jury to  find that guilt was proved  beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.  U.S. v. Santiago, 83 F.3d 20, 23 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                                  \r\n\n          Sufficient evidence existed  for the jury to  find that\r\n\nBerr os was a member of the conspiracy.  Police officers observed\r\n\nhim carrying  several bags of  heroin and found large  amounts of\r\n\ndrugs   and   distribution   paraphernalia   at  his   residence.\r\n\nFurthermore,  the sentencing  court found  that  Berr os was  the\r\n\nsupplier  of heroin  to M ndez  and the  other conspirators.   We\r\n\nreject  Berr os' contention that the  evidence showed only that a\r\n\nbuyer-seller  relationship  rather   than  a  conspiracy  existed\r\n\nbetween him and M ndez.\r\n\n          Whether a true  conspiracy exists turns on  whether the\r\n\nseller knew that  the buyer was reselling the  drugs and intended\r\n\nto  facilitate  those  resales.   Santiago,  83  F.3d  at  23-24.\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nTherefore,  knowledge   and  intent   are  the  touchstones   for\r\n\nsufficiently  proving a  conspiracy.    The government  presented\r\n\nsufficient evidence to show that Berr os knew that M ndez and his\r\n\nassociates were reselling the heroin  and that he intended to aid\r\n\nthese transactions  by supplying large  amounts of heroin  to the\r\n\nconspiracy.  Evidence  of Berr os' involvement in  the conspiracy\r\n\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict.\r\n\n              B.  Obstruction of justice enhancement\r\n\n          Much like appellant  Gonz lez, Berr os challenges  that\r\n\nportion  of his sentence  resulting from a  two-level enhancement\r\n\nfor  obstruction  of  justice.    He  contends  that   the  false\r\n\ninformation he provided  to the government  was not material  and\r\n\ndid  not significantly  impede  investigation or  prosecution  as\r\n\nrequired by  the guidelines for an obstruction enhancement.  Once\r\n\nagain  we reject  this argument.   Berr os  not only  presented a\r\n\nfalse  name to the magistrate judge and district court throughout\r\n\ntrial, but he hid  the status of  his citizenship by claiming  to\r\n\ncome  from Puerto  Rico.   By  hiding his  true identity  Berr os\r\n\nconcealed that he had previously been arrested by the Immigration\r\n\nand Naturalization  Service in 1991  and had  fled after  posting\r\n\nbail.\r\n\n          For  information to be  material it need  only have the\r\n\npotential  to  affect  an issue  under  determination,  including\r\n\nincarceration  period,  condition  of  release,  or  whether  the\r\n\nwrongful conduct  has  been mitigated  in  some way.  U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n3C1.1, commentary at n.5; U.S. v.  Kelley, 76 F.3d 436, 441  (1st\r                                                   \r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nCir.  1996).   Giving a  false identity  and  pretending to  be a\r\n\ncitizen of  this country, as  well as concealing facts  that made\r\n\nBerr os a known flight risk, could have affected some issue under\r\n\ndetermination by the court, including bail.  Although he provided\r\n\nhis  real   identity  to  the  probation  officer  prior  to  the\r\n\npreparation  of  the  presentencing  report  and  the  sentencing\r\n\nhearing, Berr os  had participated  in an  entire criminal  trial\r\n\nunder a false  name and status, which amounted  to an obstruction\r\n\nof justice.\r\n\n    C.  Sentencing Guidelines and the equal protection clause\r\n\n          Berr os  contends that the court enforced \"a vague law\"\r\n\nwhen it refused to treat crack cocaine as equal to powder cocaine\r\n\nfor sentencing purposes.  Berr os noted that  the U.S. Sentencing\r\n\nCommission has prepared a report demonstrating the disparity that\r\n\nexists between the  sentencing guidelines for powder  cocaine and\r\n\ncrack  cocaine.   We  are bound  by the  prior decisions  of this\r\n\ncircuit which  have rejected this  argument.  See, e.g.,  U.S. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAndrade, 94 F.3d  9, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1996);  U.S. v.

Until the en banc court of\r\n\nthis circuit, the U.S. Supreme Court, or Congress  itself accepts\r\n\nthis assertion of disparity and finds it untenable, challenges to\r\n\nthe  sentencing  guidelines  based   on  the  disparity   between\r\n\nsentences for crack cocaine  and powder cocaine will continue  to\r\n\nfail.  See  Irving v. U.S., 49  F.3d 830, 833-4 (1st  Cir. 1995);\r                                    \r\n\nU.S. v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.1991).\r                       \r\n\n                           IV.  Segura\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\n          Segura  was convicted  by a  jury  of Counts  I and  II\r\n\nconsisting  of   various  charges  relating  to   possession  and\r\n\nconspiracy  to  possess heroin  and  cocaine with  the  intent to\r\n\ndistribute.  He  was sentenced to 108 months  for each conviction\r\n\nconcurrently.   His original  sentence was calculated  by holding\r\n\nhim responsible for 113.7 grams of crack cocaine and 307 grams of\r\n\nheroin,  resulting in a  base offense level  of 32.   He was then\r\n\ngiven  a one-level  adjustment for  transacting drug  sales in  a\r\n\nschool  zone and  a two  level  enhancement for  possession of  a\r\n\nfirearm during  the offense,   this resulting in a  total offense\r\n\nlevel of 35.  The court then departed downward  four levels based\r\n\non the  reasoning discussed  above concerning  the nature of  the\r\n\nconspiracy.     After  consideration  of   his  criminal  history\r\n\ncategory, Segura was sentenced to 108.\r\n\n          He challenges his conviction and sentence and we affirm\r\n\nboth.\r\n\n                 A.  Sufficiency of the evidence\r\n\n          Segura maintains that  the evidence presented at  trial\r\n\nwas insufficient to establish that he knowingly and intentionally\r\n\npossessed heroin with the intent to distribute it or conspired to\r\n\ndo so.   In  considering whether  sufficient evidence to  convict\r\n\nexists, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable\r\n\nto the  verdict and  reverse only  if no rational  trier of  fact\r\n\ncould have found  him guilty.  U.S.  v. Santiago, 83 F.3d  20, 23\r                                                          \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).  The fact that the entire case against Segura is\r\n\nbased  on circumstantial,  rather than  direct,  evidence has  no\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nbearing  on  sufficiency;  both  types  of  evidence  provide  an\r\n\nadequate basis for conviction.  See  U.S. v. Valerio, 48 F.3d 58,\r                                                              \r\n\n63 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n           The government presented  two pieces of evidence  that\r\n\ntended to link Segura to the conspiracy.  First was the testimony\r\n\nof Agent Scott  Pelletier of the  Maine Drug Enforcement  Agency,\r\n\nwho  identified  Segura   as  the  person  engaged   in  counter-\r\n\nsurveillance  during at  least  one  of  the  drug  transactions.\r\n\nPelletier  was the  undercover agent  who  participated in  these\r\n\ntransactions, and his testimony about the possibility of counter-\r\n\nsurveillance was  corroborated by a  videotape that showed  a car\r\n\nsuspiciously  circling the area  where the drug  transaction took\r\n\nplace.\r\n\n          Second  was testimony  of officers  on  the scene  when\r\n\nSegura  and  others  were  arrested  at  173  University  Avenue.\r\n\nOfficers testified that they saw Segura running from the bathroom\r\n\nand   heard  the  toilet  flushing  and  Inspector  Robert  Reyes\r\n\ntestified that when he  ran into the bathroom he saw plastic bags\r\n\ncontaining a white  powdery substance go down the  toilet.  After\r\n\nSegura and others were arrested the police found  drugs, numerous\r\n\nitems  of distribution paraphernalia and  a loaded .357 Magnum at\r\n\nthe scene.\r\n\n           Taken together,  Pelletier's identification  of Segura\r\n\nas  the counter-surveillance man  and Reyes' testimony  about the\r\n\ntoilet were sufficient  to convict.  Construing this  evidence in\r\n\nfavor of  the government,  Segura's presence at  two of  the drug\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\ntransactions,  his  presence  at  what appears  to  be  the  drug\r\n\nconspiracy's center of operations, and his attempt to  dispose of\r\n\nevidence  of  the conspiracy,  taken  together show  that  he had\r\n\nknowledge of the conspiracy and  that he intended to  participate\r\n\nin it.   See U.S.  v. Santiago, 83  F.3d 20,  23 (1st cir.  1996)\r                                        \r\n\n(knowledge and intent are touchstones of conspiracy  conviction).\r\n\nWe  cannot say  that  no  reasonable jury  could  have found  him\r\n\nguilty.\r\n\n                      B.  Segura's sentence\r\n\n           I.  A codefendant's possession of a firearm\r                                                                \r\n\n          Segura, like M ndez,  contends that he should  not have\r\n\nreceived  a two-level  enhancement for  possession  of a  firearm\r\n\nduring  the drug offense  because he never  actually possessed or\r\n\nused  a gun.  He was arrested  at the residence where the gun was\r\n\nfound, and evidence existed that this residence was the center of\r\n\noperations  for the drug conspiracy.  These facts are sufficient.\r\n\nThe  sentencing guidelines  require only  that a  gun be  present\r\n\nduring  some  portion  of  an  ongoing crime.    See  U.S.S.G.   \r                                                              \r\n\n2D1.1(b)(1),  commentary  at  n.3.  Because  the defendants  were\r                                  \r\n\nconvicted of  a continuing  conspiracy, the  firearm was  present\r\n\nduring the crime.\r\n\n          Once   the  presence   of  a   weapon   is  established\r\n\nenhancement is  proper unless the defendant  demonstrates special\r\n\ncircumstances that show a clear improbability that the weapon was\r\n\nconnected to  the drug offense.  U.S. v.  Lagasse, 87 F.3d 18, 22\r                                                           \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).  Segura  did not offer any special circumstances\r\n\n                               -21-\r\r\n\nthat  would make  the connection  between the  gun and  the crime\r\n\nimprobable.  The enhancement was proper.\r\n\n         ii.  Transaction of a drug sale in a school zone\r                                                                   \r\n\n          Segura argues  that the  government did  not offer  any\r\n\nreliable proof that  any of the  drug sales  took place within  a\r\n\nprotected zone. He  acknowledges that the government  offered the\r\n\naffidavit of Special Agent Bruce Tavers as proof of the proximity\r\n\nof  a junior high  school; however,  he says  that this  proof is\r\n\ninsufficient because it lacked an evidentiary foundation.\r\n\n          In  this  circuit  a   sentencing  court  may  consider\r\n\nevidence that would  be inadmissable at trial under  the rules of\r\n\nevidence  so long  as the  sentencing court  determines  that the\r\n\nevidence has a \"sufficient indicia of reliability  to support its\r\n\nprobable accuracy.\"   U.S. v.  Tardiff, 969 F.2d 1283,  1287 (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir. 1992).   The affidavit of a  law enforcement officer  who is\r\n\nfamiliar  with  the  locale  of  the  drug  transaction  and  the\r\n\nsurrounding area is sufficiently reliable that a court can accept\r\n\nit as evidence for sentencing purposes.  Segura's enhancement for\r\n\ntransacting  drug sales  within a  school  zone was  sufficiently\r\n\nsupported and proper.\r\n\n          iii.  Segura's sentence was partially based on\r                                                                  \r\n               acquitted conduct\r                                          \r\n\n          Segura  also challenges the fact that his sentence was,\r\n\nin  part,  based   on  acquitted  conduct,  i.e.,   his  sentence\r\n\ncalculation should not have included the amount of  crack cocaine\r\n\nfound at the arrest scene because he was acquitted of all charges\r\n\ninvolving possession or distribution of crack cocaine.  \"A jury's\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nverdict of acquittal  does not prevent the  sentencing court from\r\n\nconsidering conduct underlying  the acquitted charge, so  long as\r\n\nthat conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\"\r\n\nU.S. v.

Pelletier had been introduced to Pablo by Lawrence\r\n\nFreeman,  a   cooperating  government  informant   familiar  with\r\n\nregional drug trade.  Each of the four transactions took place in\r\n\nLowell, Massachusetts,  where all  four defendants  resided.   In\r\n\neach transaction Pelletier  purchased between 50 and  500 bags of\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nheroin  from Pablo.   During  the course  of these  transactions,\r\n\nPelletier saw Gonz lez accompanying  and assisting M ndez several\r\n\ntimes and witnessed Segura conducting counter-surveillance at two\r\n\ndifferent  locations  on  July  8,   1994.    After  the   fourth\r\n\ntransaction between Pelletier and  M ndez, which took place at  a\r\n\nresidence located  at 36  Park Street,  law enforcement  officers\r\n\nbegan  arresting individuals involved.  Gonz lez was found hiding\r\n\nnear the Merrimack River, and M ndez was arrested outside 36 Park\r\n\nStreet, later shown to be the location of the heroin \"store\" that\r\n\nthe conspiracy operated.\r\n\n          The  police  then  executed a  search  warrant  for 173\r\n\nUniversity  Avenue,  also  in Lowell,  Massachusetts.    Based on\r\n\nextensive  surveillance   and  investigation  the   officers  had\r\n\nidentified numerous phone  calls between the residence  of M ndez\r\n\nand  173 University  Avenue and  between 36  Park Street  and 173\r\n\nUniversity.   Upon entering  the apartment  they observed  Segura\r\n\nrunning from  the bathroom  where plastic  bags containing  white\r\n\npowder were going  down the toilet.  Also,  within 173 University\r\n\nAvenue, the officers  seized numerous items of  drug distribution\r\n\nparaphernalia, including scales, sieves, and a \"No Way Out\" stamp\r\n\nused for labeling the type  of heroin purchased by Pelletier from\r\n\nM ndez.   They also found a large amount  of cash, 107.6 grams of\r\n\ncrack cocaine and a loaded .357 Magnum handgun.\r\n\n          Police next executed  a search warrant  at 205 and  203\r\n\nUniversity  Avenue  where  they  arrested   George  Berr os,  the\r\n\nresident.   There the  officers seized  large amounts  of heroin,\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ncrack  cocaine, and  various  items  identified  as  distribution\r\n\nparaphernalia  and  found  a notebook  containing  the  telephone\r\n\nnumber for 173 University Avenue.\r\n\n          Other  evidence  at  trial  included the  testimony  of\r\n\nChristopher  Coughlin, who admitted  purchasing heroin  and crack\r\n\nfrom  the defendants.  Coughlin identified  M ndez  as Pablo  and\r\n\nGonz lez as a man who  participated in the transactions but whose\r\n\nname he did not know.\r\n\n           After  a nineteen  day  trial,  the  jury  returned  a\r\n\nverdict convicting each  defendant of various counts  of the nine\r\n\ncount  indictment.   All  appellants were  convicted of  Count I,\r\n\nwhich  charged  that   the  defendants  had  participated   in  a\r\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute\r\n\nheroin in violation  of 21 U.S.C.    846.  After  considering the\r\n\npresentencing  report of  probation  officers,  as  well  as  the\r\n\nobjections  of both  parties to  the  report, the  district court\r\n\nsentenced the four defendant to various prison terms ranging from\r\n\n84 months for Berr os to 151 months for M ndez.\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r\n\n          We  have considered the arguments of each defendant and\r\n\nfind no error in their convictions or sentences.  Accordingly, we\r\n\naffirm.   Because each  individual raises different  and numerous\r\n\nissues and  each is  represented by  different  counsel, we  will\r\n\naddress  the contentions of  each defendant separately  with some\r\n\nnecessary repetition.\r\n\n                            I.  M ndez\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          M ndez  was convicted  of  Counts  I-V,  consisting  of\r\n\nvarious  charges relating to possession and conspiracy to possess\r\n\nheroin  and  cocaine with  the  intent  to  distribute.   He  was\r\n\nsentenced  to  151  months  for  each  conviction  to  be  served\r\n\nconcurrently.     The  sentence   was  the   result  of   several\r\n\nenhancements  which M ndez  contests  and a  significant downward\r\n\ndeparture.  The  district court explained the  downward departure\r\n\nby noting  that the lengthy  sentences for possession  of cocaine\r\n\nbase  (crack)   were  unjustified  because  the   conspiracy  was\r\n\nprimarily one to distribute heroin  rather than crack.  The court\r\n\nfound that, by including the amount of confiscated  crack cocaine\r\n\nin the sentencing calculation, the sentence of each defendant was\r\n\nincreased by as much as six  levels.  The court acknowledged that\r\n\nits  reason could  be  construed  as  a  discouraged  ground  for\r\n\ndeparture but found  that the case fell  out of the  heartland of\r\n\nprescribed  conduct, thus  warranting departure.   This  downward\r\n\ndeparture is not  questioned by the government;  therefore, we do\r\n\nnot reach whether it  was proper.  The  departure resulted in  an\r\n\noffense  level of 35  for M ndez.  Based  on his criminal history\r\n\ncategory he received a 151 month sentence.\r\n\n          We affirm M ndez's convictions and sentences.\r\n\n             A.  Testimony of defense witness Fortin\r\n\n          M ndez contends that his  conviction should be reversed\r\n\nbecause he was precluded  from offering the testimony  of Loretta\r\n\nFortin.  The essence of her testimony would have been that M ndez\r\n\nwas not the \"Pablo\" she was  introduced to during a drug sale  in\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nJune of 1994.   Furthermore, M ndez called Fortin  to discuss her\r\n\nmeeting  with Special  Agent  Connick in  August of  1994, during\r\n\nwhich  she  identified  the photograph  of  another  defendant as\r\n\nPablo.   The relevancy  of this testimony  is that  an individual\r\n\nnamed Pablo  was the  supposed leader of  the conspiracy  and the\r\n\ndealer with  whom the  government initially  dealt.   Differences\r\n\nexisted as to which member  of the conspiracy was actually Pablo,\r\n\nbut several witnesses testified that M ndez was in fact Pablo and\r\n\nthat M ndez carried a beeper with the number belonging to Pablo.\r\n\n          The  substance of  Loretta Fortin's  proposed testimony\r\n\nwas that she had one meeting  with Pablo in which he entered  the\r\n\nback  seat  of her  car while  she  remained in  the front.   Her\r\n\nhusband introduced  the man as  Pablo, and they conducted  a drug\r\n\ntransaction.  Fortin  was willing to testify that  M ndez was not\r\n\nthe Pablo that  entered her car and that she selected a different\r\n\ndefendant as Pablo  from police photographs.  The  court excluded\r\n\nthis testimony because  it was based on  the inadmissable hearsay\r\n\nof the  introduction of  Pablo by her  husband.   M ndez contends\r\n\nthat  this  exclusion  was  erroneous  because  Federal  Rule  of\r\n\nEvidence 801(d)(1)(c) provides that if a witness is available for\r\n\ncross examination,  prior statements  of  identification are  not\r\n\nhearsay.   This assertion  misses the  point.   Fortin's proposed\r\n\ntestimony about her  husband's introduction of Pablo  created the\r\n\nhearsay problem, not her prior identification statements to Agent\r\n\nConnick.  To  make her testimony  credible she had to  admit that\r\n\nher  knowledge  of Pablo's  identity  was  based on  the  hearsay\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nstatement of her husband - \"this is Pablo.\"\r\n\n          By  echoing   her  husband's  introduction   of  Pablo,\r\n\nFortin's proposed  testimony meets the prerequisites  of hearsay.\r\n\nThe  introduction  of  Pablo  is  a statement  not  made  by  the\r\n\ndeclarant in testimony  offered to prove the truth  of the matter\r\n\nasserted.    For Loretta  Fortin's  testimony to  be  tenable the\r\n\nstatement made by her  husband must have been  true.  Because  we\r\n\nhave  no  way  of  verifying that  Mr.  Fortin  was  sufficiently\r\n\nfamiliar with Pablo to identify him to Mrs. Fortin, her testimony\r\n\nabout Pablo is classic hearsay and was properly excluded.\r\n\n          Accordingly,  the  district   court  did  not  err   in\r\n\ndisallowing  Fortin's testimony on hearsay grounds.  Moreover, if\r\n\nerror, it would have been harmless.  Even if the introduction was\r\n\nnot hearsay, given  Fortin's limited interaction with  Pablo, the\r\n\nweight  of her  testimony  could  not  overcome  the  substantial\r\n\ntestimony of other  credible witnesses who had more  contact with\r\n\nM ndez/Pablo and  who testified  that M ndez  was in  fact Pablo.\r\n\nSee U.S. v.

The affidavit of  a law\r\n\nenforcement   officer  familiar  with  the  locale  of  the  drug\r\n\ntransaction and  the  surrounding area  is sufficiently  reliable\r\n\nthat a court  can accept it as evidence  for sentencing purposes.\r\n\nM ndez  did  not object to  this evidence, and  we find no  plain\r\n\nerror.

He  was arrested at a different  locale from where\r\n\nthe gun was found,  but evidence  showed that he was seen exiting\r\n\nthe  residence where  the gun  was found,  that he had  made many\r\n\ncalls  to this residence, that the residents were coconspirators,\r\n\nand  that the  residence was  a  center for  the drug  operation.\r\n\nThese  facts are  sufficient  for  the  enhancement  because  the\r\n\nsentencing guidelines require  only that a gun  be present during\r\n\nsome  portion of  an ongoing crime.

Gonz lez\r\n\n          Pedro Gonz lez  was convicted of  Counts I,  IV, and  V\r\n\nconsisting  of   various  charges  relating  to   possession  and\r\n\nconspiracy to possess  heroin with intent to distribute.   He was\r\n\nsentenced to  135 months  concurrent for  each  conviction.   His\r\n\noriginal  sentence was calculated  by his being  held responsible\r\n\nfor  113.7  grams of  crack  cocaine  and  307 grams  of  heroin,\r\n\nresulting  in a base  offense level of  33.  He was  then given a\r\n\ntwo-level adjustment for  obstruction of justice for  providing a\r\n\nfalse name and  personal history and a  two-level enhancement for\r\n\npossession  of a  firearm  during  a  drug  trafficking  offense,\r\n\nresulting  in a  total offense level  of 37.   The district court\r\n\ndeparted    downward  four  levels  because  it  found  that  the\r\n\nconspiracy  was primarily for  the distribution of  heroin rather\r\n\nthan crack  cocaine.   Because he found  that the  crack offenses\r\n\nwere  outside   the  heartland  offenses  under   the  applicable\r\n\nguideline, he granted a  four-level downward departure, resulting\r\n\nin a new  base offense level of  33.  After the  court considered\r\n\nhis criminal history category, he  was sentenced to 108 months in\r\n\nprison.  We affirm his sentence.\r\n\n              A. Obstruction of justice enhancement\r\n\n          Gonz lez contends that  he did not deserve  a two-level\r\n\nenhancement  for   obstruction  of  justice  because   the  false\r\n\nstatements  he  made concerning  his identity  did not  amount to\r\n\nmaterially false  information as  required by  U.S.S.G.    3C1.1.\r\n\nSection  3C1.1  provides   that  a  two  level   enhancement  for\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nobstruction  is  proper  where a  defendant  provides \"materially\r\n\nfalse information\" to a judge, magistrate or a probation officer.\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    3C1.1, commentary at  n.3(f)&amp;(h).

Berr os\r\n\n          George Berr os was convicted  of Counts I, VI, and  VII\r\n\nconsisting  of  various  charges   relating  to  possession   and\r\n\nconspiracy  to  possess   heroin  and  cocaine  with   intent  to\r\n\ndistribute.   He was  sentenced to 84  months concurrently.   His\r\n\noriginal sentence was  calculated by holding him  responsible for\r\n\n26.08  grams of  crack  cocaine  and 307  grams  of heroin  which\r\n\nresulted in a base offense level of 30.  He was then given a two-\r\n\nlevel adjustment for obstruction of justice for providing a false\r\n\nname and personal history, resulting  in a total offense level of\r\n\n32.   The  court then  departed downward  between three  and four\r\n\nlevels  based on  reasoning discussed  previously concerning  the\r\n\nnature  of the conspiracy.   After consideration  of his criminal\r\n\nhistory category, Berr os was sentenced to 84 months.\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n          Berr os questions both his conviction and sentence.  We\r\n\naffirm both.\r\n\n                 A.  Sufficiency of the evidence\r\n\n          Berr os   argues  that   the  evidence   presented  was\r\n\ninsufficient to sustain his  conviction for conspiracy.  He  says\r\n\nthat the government presented no  evidence that he assented to be\r\n\na part  of the  conspiracy or participated  in the  conspiracy to\r\n\ndistribute  heroin.   We  customarily  must  decide  whether  the\r\n\nevidence,    considered  in  the  light  most  favorable  to  the\r\n\ngovernment  -  \"a perspective  that  requires  us to  draw  every\r\n\nplausible inference in line with the verdict and to resolve every\r\n\ncredibility  conflict  in the  same  fashion\"  -  would  allow  a\r\n\nrational jury to  find that guilt was proved  beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.  U.S. v. Santiago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196737\"><a href=\"/opinion/196737/united-states-v-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                                  \r\n\n          Sufficient evidence existed  for the jury to  find that\r\n\nBerr os was a member of the conspiracy.  Police officers observed\r\n\nhim carrying  several bags of  heroin and found large  amounts of\r\n\ndrugs   and   distribution   paraphernalia   at  his   residence.\r\n\nFurthermore,  the sentencing  court found  that  Berr os was  the\r\n\nsupplier  of heroin  to M ndez  and the  other conspirators.   We\r\n\nreject  Berr os' contention that the  evidence showed only that a\r\n\nbuyer-seller  relationship  rather   than  a  conspiracy  existed\r\n\nbetween him and M ndez.\r\n\n          Whether a true  conspiracy exists turns on  whether the\r\n\nseller knew that  the buyer was reselling the  drugs and intended\r\n\nto  facilitate  those  resales.   Santiago,  83  F.3d  at  23-24.\r                                                    \r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nTherefore,  knowledge   and  intent   are  the  touchstones   for\r\n\nsufficiently  proving a  conspiracy.    The government  presented\r\n\nsufficient evidence to show that Berr os knew that M ndez and his\r\n\nassociates were reselling the heroin  and that he intended to aid\r\n\nthese transactions  by supplying large  amounts of heroin  to the\r\n\nconspiracy.  Evidence  of Berr os' involvement in  the conspiracy\r\n\nwas sufficient for a reasonable jury to convict.\r\n\n              B.  Obstruction of justice enhancement\r\n\n          Much like appellant  Gonz lez, Berr os challenges  that\r\n\nportion  of his sentence  resulting from a  two-level enhancement\r\n\nfor  obstruction  of  justice.    He  contends  that   the  false\r\n\ninformation he provided  to the government  was not material  and\r\n\ndid  not significantly  impede  investigation or  prosecution  as\r\n\nrequired by  the guidelines for an obstruction enhancement.  Once\r\n\nagain  we reject  this argument.   Berr os  not only  presented a\r\n\nfalse  name to the magistrate judge and district court throughout\r\n\ntrial, but he hid  the status of  his citizenship by claiming  to\r\n\ncome  from Puerto  Rico.   By  hiding his  true identity  Berr os\r\n\nconcealed that he had previously been arrested by the Immigration\r\n\nand Naturalization  Service in 1991  and had  fled after  posting\r\n\nbail.\r\n\n          For  information to be  material it need  only have the\r\n\npotential  to  affect  an issue  under  determination,  including\r\n\nincarceration  period,  condition  of  release,  or  whether  the\r\n\nwrongful conduct  has  been mitigated  in  some way.

Giving a  false identity  and  pretending to  be a\r\n\ncitizen of  this country, as  well as concealing facts  that made\r\n\nBerr os a known flight risk, could have affected some issue under\r\n\ndetermination by the court, including bail.  Although he provided\r\n\nhis  real   identity  to  the  probation  officer  prior  to  the\r\n\npreparation  of  the  presentencing  report  and  the  sentencing\r\n\nhearing, Berr os  had participated  in an  entire criminal  trial\r\n\nunder a false  name and status, which amounted  to an obstruction\r\n\nof justice.\r\n\n    C.  Sentencing Guidelines and the equal protection clause\r\n\n          Berr os  contends that the court enforced \"a vague law\"\r\n\nwhen it refused to treat crack cocaine as equal to powder cocaine\r\n\nfor sentencing purposes.  Berr os noted that  the U.S. Sentencing\r\n\nCommission has prepared a report demonstrating the disparity that\r\n\nexists between the  sentencing guidelines for powder  cocaine and\r\n\ncrack  cocaine.   We  are bound  by the  prior decisions  of this\r\n\ncircuit which  have rejected this  argument.

Segura\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\n          Segura  was convicted  by a  jury  of Counts  I and  II\r\n\nconsisting  of   various  charges  relating  to   possession  and\r\n\nconspiracy  to  possess heroin  and  cocaine with  the  intent to\r\n\ndistribute.  He  was sentenced to 108 months  for each conviction\r\n\nconcurrently.   His original  sentence was calculated  by holding\r\n\nhim responsible for 113.7 grams of crack cocaine and 307 grams of\r\n\nheroin,  resulting in a  base offense level  of 32.   He was then\r\n\ngiven  a one-level  adjustment for  transacting drug  sales in  a\r\n\nschool  zone and  a two  level  enhancement for  possession of  a\r\n\nfirearm during  the offense,   this resulting in a  total offense\r\n\nlevel of 35.  The court then departed downward  four levels based\r\n\non the  reasoning discussed  above concerning  the nature of  the\r\n\nconspiracy.     After  consideration  of   his  criminal  history\r\n\ncategory, Segura was sentenced to 108.\r\n\n          He challenges his conviction and sentence and we affirm\r\n\nboth.\r\n\n                 A.  Sufficiency of the evidence\r\n\n          Segura maintains that  the evidence presented at  trial\r\n\nwas insufficient to establish that he knowingly and intentionally\r\n\npossessed heroin with the intent to distribute it or conspired to\r\n\ndo so.   In  considering whether  sufficient evidence to  convict\r\n\nexists, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable\r\n\nto the  verdict and  reverse only  if no rational  trier of  fact\r\n\ncould have found  him guilty.

The fact that the entire case against Segura is\r\n\nbased  on circumstantial,  rather than  direct,  evidence has  no\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nbearing  on  sufficiency;  both  types  of  evidence  provide  an\r\n\nadequate basis for conviction.

First was the testimony\r\n\nof Agent Scott  Pelletier of the  Maine Drug Enforcement  Agency,\r\n\nwho  identified  Segura   as  the  person  engaged   in  counter-\r\n\nsurveillance  during at  least  one  of  the  drug  transactions.\r\n\nPelletier  was the  undercover agent  who  participated in  these\r\n\ntransactions, and his testimony about the possibility of counter-\r\n\nsurveillance was  corroborated by a  videotape that showed  a car\r\n\nsuspiciously  circling the area  where the drug  transaction took\r\n\nplace.\r\n\n          Second  was testimony  of officers  on  the scene  when\r\n\nSegura  and  others  were  arrested  at  173  University  Avenue.\r\n\nOfficers testified that they saw Segura running from the bathroom\r\n\nand   heard  the  toilet  flushing  and  Inspector  Robert  Reyes\r\n\ntestified that when he  ran into the bathroom he saw plastic bags\r\n\ncontaining a white  powdery substance go down the  toilet.  After\r\n\nSegura and others were arrested the police found  drugs, numerous\r\n\nitems  of distribution paraphernalia and  a loaded .357 Magnum at\r\n\nthe scene.\r\n\n           Taken together,  Pelletier's identification  of Segura\r\n\nas  the counter-surveillance man  and Reyes' testimony  about the\r\n\ntoilet were sufficient  to convict.  Construing this  evidence in\r\n\nfavor of  the government,  Segura's presence at  two of  the drug\r\n\n                               -20-\r\r\n\ntransactions,  his  presence  at  what appears  to  be  the  drug\r\n\nconspiracy's center of operations, and his attempt to  dispose of\r\n\nevidence  of  the conspiracy,  taken  together show  that  he had\r\n\nknowledge of the conspiracy and  that he intended to  participate\r\n\nin it.

He was arrested  at the residence where the gun was\r\n\nfound, and evidence existed that this residence was the center of\r\n\noperations  for the drug conspiracy.  These facts are sufficient.\r\n\nThe  sentencing guidelines  require only  that a  gun be  present\r\n\nduring  some  portion  of  an  ongoing crime.    See  U.S.S.G.   \r                                                              \r\n\n2D1.1(b)(1),  commentary  at  n.3.  Because  the defendants  were\r                                  \r\n\nconvicted of  a continuing  conspiracy, the  firearm was  present\r\n\nduring the crime.\r\n\n          Once   the  presence   of  a   weapon   is  established\r\n\nenhancement is  proper unless the defendant  demonstrates special\r\n\ncircumstances that show a clear improbability that the weapon was\r\n\nconnected to  the drug offense.

Segura's sentence was partially based on\r                                                                  \r\n               acquitted conduct\r                                          \r\n\n          Segura  also challenges the fact that his sentence was,\r\n\nin  part,  based   on  acquitted  conduct,  i.e.,   his  sentence\r\n\ncalculation should not have included the amount of  crack cocaine\r\n\nfound at the arrest scene because he was acquitted of all charges\r\n\ninvolving possession or distribution of crack cocaine.  \"A jury's\r\n\n                               -22-\r\r\n\nverdict of acquittal  does not prevent the  sentencing court from\r\n\nconsidering conduct underlying  the acquitted charge, so  long as\r\n\nthat conduct has been proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\"\r\n\nU.S. v.
