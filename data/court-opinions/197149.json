BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Since one  of Logue's principal complaints  is that the\r\n\ndistrict  court  took his  false  arrest  and false  imprisonment\r\n\nclaims from the jury at the close  of his case in chief, we assay\r\n\nthe  facts  in  the  perspective  most  advantageous  to  Logue's\r\n\nposition.   See,  e.g., Veranda  Beach Club  Ltd. Partnership  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nWestern Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1375 (1st Cir. 1991).\r                          \r\n\n          In 1990, Logue and his wife became embroiled in divorce\r\n\nproceedings.   Despite this  discord, the couple  continued for a\r\n\ntime to share the marital domicile at 411 School St., Marshfield,\r\n\nMassachusetts.  The situation changed on  November 13, 1992, when\r\n\nMrs.  Logue secured  an ex  parte  restraining order  barring her\r\n\nestranged husband  from the  School St.  premises.1   Pursuant to\r\n\nthat order the  Marshfield police asked  Logue to remove  himself\r\n\nfrom the property, and he complied.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Mrs. Logue obtained the restraining order under a state law\r\nwhich provides that, in various situations (including matrimonial\r\ndisputes), a court \"may  enter such temporary orders as  it deems\r\nnecessary to protect  a plaintiff from abuse . . . .\"  Mass. Gen.\r\nL. ch. 209A,   4 (West 1996).  The statute  further provides that\r\n\"[i]f  the  plaintiff demonstrates  a  substantial  likelihood of\r\nimmediate danger  of abuse,  the court  may enter  such temporary\r\nrelief  orders  without  notice  .  .  .  and  shall  immediately\r\nthereafter notify  the defendant  that the temporary  orders have\r\nbeen issued.\"  Id.  In that event, \"[n]otice shall be made by the\r                            \r\nappropriate law enforcement agency.\"  Id.\r                                                   \r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          Three days  later Logue prevailed upon  the state court\r\n\nto amend its November  13 order.  The amendment gave Logue access\r\n\nto the premises  between the hours of 8:00 a.m.  and 6:00 p.m. so\r\n\nthat he could  continue to operate  his painting business  (which\r\n\nwas based in a garage on the property).\r\n\n          By its  terms, the amended order expired on December 2,\r\n\n1992.   On that  date,  the state  court  convened a  hearing  to\r\n\ndetermine inter alia whether  the restraining order should remain\r                              \r\n\nin  effect,  and if  so, whether  Logue  should still  be allowed\r\n\nlimited  access to the marital  premises.  The  parties and their\r\n\ncounsel appeared but, when the judge reserved decision, Logue and\r\n\nhis  lawyer departed without awaiting the ruling.  Late that same\r\n\nmorning the judge renewed the original restraining order, thereby\r\n\neffectively rescinding Logue's daytime privileges and banning him\r\n\nfrom the premises in toto.\r                                   \r\n\n          Unaware that a completely prohibitory order had issued,\r\n\nLogue repaired  to School St.  on December 2.   His wife returned\r\n\nthat  afternoon, told him of the judge's decision, and asked that\r\n\nhe  leave.   Logue  continued  working.   Disquieted,  Mrs. Logue\r\n\ncalled  the  Marshfield police  to report  what  she viewed  as a\r\n\nblatant  violation of the new restraining  order.  Officer Ronald\r\n\nDore responded to the call.  When Dore arrived, Mrs. Logue showed\r\n\nhim  a copy  of the  current  restraining order.   By  that time,\r\n\nhowever, Logue had evacuated the premises.\r\n\n          After leaving the scene Logue contacted his attorney in\r\n\nan effort  to ascertain  the terms  of  the new  restrainer.   He\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nreceived no definitive guidance.   Instead, his lawyer instructed\r\n\nhim  to stop by  his office the  next morning so  that they could\r\n\nstraighten out the situation.\r\n\n          As a matter of  form, a restraining order of  this sort\r\n\nis  composed  of a  series of  multicolored  carbon copies  to be\r\n\ndistributed to various parties.   Typically, there is a  copy for\r\n\nthe  court's use, one for the probation department's use, one for\r\n\nthe  plaintiff, one for the  defendant, one for  the local police\r\n\ndepartment, and a final copy on which the return of service is to\r\n\nbe inscribed.   Early on the morning of December 3, Dore reviewed\r\n\nthe police copy of  the newly minted restraining order.   He then\r\n\nproceeded  on routine patrol.  In the meantime Logue bypassed his\r\n\nlawyer's office,  returned to the marital  residence, and resumed\r\n\nwork.  Dore observed Logue's vehicle in  the driveway, confronted\r\n\nhim in  the garage, and    turning a deaf ear  to Logue's protest\r\n\nthat  he had the right to be on  the property during the day, and\r\n\nthat he  could verify his status by a telephone call   placed him\r\n\nunder  arrest   for  violating  the  restraining   order.    Dore\r\n\ntransported Logue  to police headquarters and booked  him.  Logue\r\n\nwas then taken to the state court and arraigned.  Eventually, the\r\n\ncharges against him were dropped.\r\n\n          Logue mounted  a counterattack, suing Dore  for damages\r\n\nunder 42  U.S.C.    1983  in  the federal  district  court.   His\r\n\ncomplaint  contained  three  counts  that  are  germane  to  this\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nappeal.2  In those  counts Logue contended that Dore  had falsely\r\n\narrested and  imprisoned him,  and had employed  excessive force,\r\n\nall  in derogation of section  1983.  During  trial, the district\r\n\ncourt  directed a verdict in  the defendant's favor  on the false\r\n\narrest  and false  imprisonment  counts.   The jury  subsequently\r\n\nfound  for the defendant on the excessive force claim.  Following\r\n\na peculiar colloquy  related to fees  and costs (described  infra\r                                                                           \r\n\nPart IV), Logue filed this appeal.\r\n\nII.  THE DIRECTED VERDICT\r          II.  THE DIRECTED VERDICT\r\n\n          Logue  assigns  error to  the  entry of  judgment  as a\r\n\nmatter  of law on the false arrest and false imprisonment claims,\r\n\nasserting that  he  adduced  enough  evidence to  create  a  jury\r\n\nquestion as to  whether Dore  had probable cause  to arrest  him.\r\n\nThe  standard  under  which  we review  Logue's  challenge  is so\r\n\nfamiliar  that it  verges  on the  banal:   without  taking  into\r\n\nconsideration the credibility  of witnesses, resolving  conflicts\r\n\nin testimony, or evaluating  the weight of the evidence,  could a\r\n\nreasonable jury  find for the  plaintiff on the  proof presented?\r\n\nSee Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                        \r\n\nWe will affirm the judgment only if, after surveying the evidence\r\n\nand  the  inferences  derivable   therefrom  in  the  light  most\r\n\nflattering  to  the  plaintiff,  we  determine  that  a  rational\r\n\nfactfinder  could  have reached  no  conclusion  except that  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Originally,  Logue  asserted  other  claims  against  Dore,\r\nvarious  unnamed  Marshfield police  officers,  and  the Town  of\r\nMarshfield.   Because  the case  proceeded to  trial only  on the\r\nfederal claims against Dore, we limit our discussion accordingly.\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\nplaintiff take nothing.   See  Veranda Beach, 936  F.2d at  1375;\r                                                      \r\n\nWagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir. 1987).\r                            \r\n\n          In  trying  the  false  arrest and  false  imprisonment\r\n\ncounts,  Logue's  theory  was   that  Dore  violated  his  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment  rights  by  arresting  him  without  probable   cause.\r\n\nAccording to  Logue, there  was no  probable  cause because  Dore\r\n\nlacked  any reason  to believe that  Logue knew the  terms of the\r\n\nDecember  2 restraining order and intentionally violated it.  The\r\n\nlower court rejected this premise.  So do we.\r\n\n          The  constitutionality of a warrantless arrest \"depends\r\n\n.  .  . upon  whether, at  the moment  the  arrest was  made, the\r\n\nofficer[] had probable cause to make it.\"  Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S.\r                                                                 \r\n\n89, 91 (1964).  In turn, probable cause to make  an arrest exists\r\n\nif    and  only if    the  facts and  circumstances of  which the\r\n\narresting  officer  has  knowledge  are  sufficient  to  lead  an\r\n\nordinarily prudent officer to conclude that  an offense has been,\r\n\nis being,  or is about  to be  committed, and  that the  putative\r\n\narrestee  is involved in the  crime's commission.   See Rivera v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMurphy, 979 F.2d 259, 263 (1st  Cir. 1992); Hoffman v. Reali, 973\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 980, 985 (1st Cir. 1992).  In sum, the existence of probable\r\n\ncause (and, in turn, the validity of an ensuing arrest) is gauged\r\n\nby  an   objective  standard;   as  long  as   the  circumstances\r\n\nsurrounding  the event  warrant the  officer's reasonable  belief\r\n\nthat the  action taken is  appropriate, the arrest  is justified.\r\n\nSee Scott v. United  States, 436 U.S. 128, 137-38  (1978); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st Cir. 1987); see also\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nWhren v. United  States, 116  S. Ct. 1769,  1774 (1996)  (holding\r                                 \r\n\nthat \"[s]ubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-\r\n\ncause  Fourth  Amendment  analysis\").     And,  moreover,  though\r\n\nprobable cause  requires more  than mere  suspicion, it does  not\r\n\nrequire the same quantum of  proof as is needed to convict.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Aguirre, 839 F.2d 854, 857-58 (1st Cir. 1988).\r                                  \r\n\n          At  first blush  it  appears that  Dore surpassed  this\r\n\nminimum.   After  all, the  evidence  is straightforward  that an\r\n\nunqualified chapter 209A restraining  order issued on December 2,\r\n\nand that order,  by its terms, barred  Logue from the  School St.\r\n\nproperty.  The record  is equally pellucid that Dore  learned the\r\n\nterms  of that  order  on two  separate  occasions before  taking\r\n\naction.   Thus, Dore knew  prior to arresting  Logue that Logue's\r\n\nmere  presence  on  the  School  St.  premises  transgressed  the\r\n\nrestraining order and thereby constituted a criminal act.  In the\r\n\nlower court's view, no more was exigible.\r\n\n          Logue seeks  to blunt  the force of  this reasoning  by\r\n\nelevating  the probable cause threshold.   He would  have us rule\r\n\nthat, in  addition to  the arresting officer's  reasonable belief\r\n\nthat the restraining order was  being violated, probable cause in\r\n\nthis  case could only be established if the officer also believed\r\n\nthat the violator himself knew the terms of the order.   But this\r\n\nembellishment has no  basis in the law.   What the arrestee knows\r\n\nor does not know at the time of his apprehension is irrelevant to\r\n\nthe question of whether the arresting officer has probable cause.\r\n\n          To be  frank, we  find it difficult  to understand  the\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nnexus  that  Logue  strives  to fashion  between  the  arrestee's\r\n\nknowledge and  the probable cause  determination.  It  seems most\r\n\nlikely  that  Logue  has   confused  the  elements  necessary  to\r\n\nestablish probable cause with the elements necessary to determine\r\n\nguilt or  innocence.   The  arrestee's knowledge  is, of  course,\r\n\nrelevant to  the latter  determination, for the  Commonwealth, in\r\n\norder to convict Logue of violating  the chapter 209A restraining\r\n\norder,  would be  required to  show scienter,  that is,  to prove\r\n\nbeyond  a reasonable doubt that  he had knowledge  or notice that\r\n\nsuch an order had been issued against him.  See Mass. Gen. L. ch.\r                                                         \r\n\n209A,    7 (West 1996);  Commonwealth v. Gordon,  553 N.E.2d 915,\r                                                         \r\n\n918-19 &amp; n.3 (Mass. 1990).  Nevertheless, this requirement has no\r\n\nbearing on the reasonableness  of Dore's belief that a  crime was\r\n\nbeing  committed (especially  since he,  himself, had  told Logue\r\n\nwhat the order provided),  and it therefore fails to  address the\r\n\nexistence vel non of probable cause.3\r                           \r\n\n          We will  not paint the lily.  In light of the facts and\r\n\ncircumstances unquestionably  known to  Dore at  the time  of the\r\n\narrest,  no reasonable  jury could find  that he  lacked probable\r\n\ncause to take Logue into custody.  It follows inexorably that the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3Logue  implies that Dore's refusal  to allow him  to make a\r\ntelephone  call to verify the terms  of the December 2 order made\r\nthe  arrest unreasonable.  To be sure, there are circumstances in\r\nwhich \"an arresting  officer may  have a duty  to pursue  further\r\ninformation  if it  is available  and likely to  be trustworthy.\"\r\nPalhava de Varella-Cid v.  Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank,  787 F.2d\r                                                                \r\n676,  680 (1st Cir. 1986).   In this  situation, however, further\r\ninvestigation merely  would have buttressed the  officer's belief\r\nand confirmed  Logue's violation of the  chapter 209A restraining\r\norder.  Thus, Logue's argument is not advanced by Dore's rebuff.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\ndistrict court appropriately granted judgment as a matter of  law\r\n\nin  favor  of  the  defendant  on  the  false  arrest  and  false\r\n\nimprisonment counts.\r\n\nIII.  THE JUDGE'S ATTITUDE\r          III.  THE JUDGE'S ATTITUDE\r\n\n          Logue's next  assignment of error  sweeps more broadly.\r\n\nHe contends  that the district judge's biased attitude and heavy-\r\n\nhanded  manner  deprived  him of  an  impartial  trial, and  that\r\n\nfundamental fairness demands that we wipe the slate clean.  These\r\n\nare serious charges, and we treat them as such.\r\n\n          We  start  with  an   overview  of  the  settled  legal\r\n\nprinciples that pertain  to claims of  this genre.   It is  well-\r\n\nestablished  that  a  judge is  not  a mere  umpire;  he  is \"the\r\n\ngovernor  of the  trial for  the purpose  of assuring  its proper\r\n\nconduct,\" and has a perfect right   albeit a right that should be\r\n\nexercised  with  care    to  participate  actively  in  the trial\r\n\nproper.  Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 469  (1933).  It\r                                           \r\n\nis,  moreover, beyond  cavil that  a trial  judge in  the federal\r\n\nsystem  retains the common law power to question witnesses and to\r\n\nanalyze,  dissect,   explain,  summarize,  and   comment  on  the\r\n\nevidence.  See  id.; see also  United States v.  Paiva, 892  F.2d\r                                                                \r\n\n148, 159 (1st  Cir. 1989);  see generally Fed.  R. Evid.  614(b).\r                                                   \r\n\nStill, there are lines which a trial judge should not cross.  For\r\n\nexample, the  judge's participation  must be balanced;  he cannot\r\n\nbecome  an  advocate  or otherwise  use  his  judicial  powers to\r\n\nadvantage or disadvantage  a party  unfairly.   See Quercia,  289\r                                                                     \r\n\nU.S.  at 470;  Paiva, 892  F.2d at  159; see  also Fed.  R. Evid.\r                                                            \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\n614(b) advisory committee's note.\r\n\n          An  inquiry  into  the  judge's conduct  of  the  trial\r\n\nnecessarily  turns on  the  question of  whether the  complaining\r\n\nparty  can show serious prejudice.  See Aggarwal v. Ponce Sch. of\r                                                                           \r\n\nMed.,  837 F.2d  17,  22  (1st Cir.  1988).    In answering  this\r              \r\n\nquestion  a reviewing  court  must evaluate  the judge's  actions\r\n\n\"according   to  a   standard  of   fairness   and  impartiality,\r\n\nrecognizing  that each case  tends to be  fact-specific.\"  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v. Polito, 856 F.2d  414, 418 (1st  Cir. 1988) (citations\r                           \r\n\nand internal quotation marks omitted).  This process requires the\r\n\nreviewing  court   to   differentiate  between   expressions   of\r\n\nimpatience,  annoyance or  ire,  on the  one  hand, and  bias  or\r\n\npartiality, on the other  hand.  See Liteky v. United States, 510\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S.  540,  555-56  (1994).   While  the  former  are  not  to be\r\n\nencouraged, the latter are flatly prohibited.\r\n\n          In this case, Logue contends that the judge's comments,\r\n\nquestioning of  witnesses, and chastisement of  his trial counsel\r\n\n(Attorney  Stockwell-Alpert)  skewed  the  proceedings.    Having\r\n\npainstakingly reviewed the transcript  of this five-day trial, we\r\n\nare satisfied  that the incidents  of which Logue  complains show\r\n\nlittle  more  than  the  judge's efforts  to  clarify  testimony,\r\n\nexpedite the trial, and maintain courtroom decorum.  In short, we\r\n\nfind that Logue received a fair trial, albeit not a perfect or an\r\n\nunblemished one.   He was not entitled to more.   See Polito, 856\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at 418.\r\n\n          We  see no need to  cite book and  verse in response to\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\neach of Logue's criticisms.  A summary should suffice.\r\n\n          1.  Logue asserts that the judge exhibited bias both by\r                    1.\r\n\ninterjecting  hostile  questions  during  his  testimony  and  by\r\n\ntreating the  defendant's  testimony solicitously.    However,  a\r\n\nclose  reading of  the transcript  reveals no  such contrast.   A\r\n\njudge has  wide discretion  to interject  questions  in order  to\r\n\nthrow light upon testimony or expedite the pace of a  trial.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nDeary v. City of Gloucester, 9  F.3d 191, 194-95 (1st Cir. 1993);\r                                     \r\n\nUnited States v.  Olmstead, 832  F.2d 642, 648  (1st Cir.  1987),\r                                    \r\n\ncert.  denied, 486 U.S. 1009 (1988).  Here, the judge's questions\r                       \r\n\nstrike  us as  designed  to simplify  the  jury's task,  and,  in\r\n\nrespect to Logue's testimony, to clarify his frequently vague and\r\n\nconfusing answers.  Many  of the judge's queries did no more than\r\n\nrestate the examiner's questions,  and his oft-uttered  responses\r\n\n(e.g.,  \"all  right\" or  \"I see\")  to  Logue's answers  were well\r\n\nwithin the realm of impartiality.\r\n\n          2.  Logue's claim that the judge displayed bias against\r                    2.\r\n\nhim rests  heavily on two comments.  First, the judge referred to\r\n\nLogue in  the jury's presence  as \"the  accuser.\"  We  regard the\r\n\ncomment  as innocuous,  particularly  when its  likely impact  is\r\n\nevaluated on the entire record.  This case is no exception.  More\r\n\ntroubling is that, after Logue completed his testimony, the judge\r\n\nexcused the jury and made the following statement:\r\n\n          I just  want to  put it  on the  record that I  totally\r\n          disbelieve the plaintiff in this case.  I think he's an\r\n          absolute and incorrigible liar.   And it's my intention\r\n          at the  conclusion of this  case to request  the United\r\n          States Attorney to conduct an investigation into  these\r\n          matters relative to seeking an indictment for perjury.\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\n          To be sure,  it was unnecessary for the  judge to go on\r\n\nrecord at that stage, but his comments indicate no more than that\r\n\nhe  had grave doubts anent  Logue's credibility.   Judges are not\r\n\nexpected  to  refrain  from  forming  opinions  about  witnesses'\r\n\ncredibility   how else would  a judge be able to decide a case or\r\n\npass on  a motion for a new  trial?   and the  mere fact that the\r\n\njudge voices his opinion out of the presence of the jury does not\r\n\nirretrievably taint the trial.  Cf. Liteky, 510 U.S. 550-51 (\"The\r                                                    \r\n\njudge  who  presides  at a  trial  may,  upon  completion of  the\r\n\nevidence, be exceedingly ill  disposed towards the defendant, who\r\n\nhas been shown to be a thoroughly  reprehensible person.  But the\r\n\njudge is not thereby  recusable for bias or prejudice,  since his\r\n\nknowledge  and   the  opinion  it  produced   were  properly  and\r\n\nnecessarily acquired in the course of the proceedings  . . . .\").\r\n\nSince there is no evidence that the judge allowed his low opinion\r\n\nof Logue's veracity to mar his conduct of the trial,  we will not\r\n\ndisturb  the judgment.  Logue was entitled to an impartial judge;\r\n\nhe was not entitled to an ingenuous one.\r\n\n          3.     Logue   further   contends  that   the   judge's\r                    3.\r\n\ndisparagement of  Stockwell-Alpert deprived him of  a fair trial.\r\n\nAs a  general  rule,  a  judge's mid-trial  remarks  critical  of\r\n\ncounsel are insufficient to  sustain a claim of judicial  bias or\r\n\npartiality against the client.  See Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555.\r                                                    \r\n\n          Here,  the  challenged  comments  occurred  at  various\r\n\ntimes, some at sidebar and some in the presence of the jury.  The\r\n\ncomments at sidebar need  not detain us; it suffices  to say that\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\nnone were beyond the pale.  In the most ill-advised such  remark,\r\n\nthe judge  referred to the lawyer  as a \"smart little  guy.\"  The\r\n\ndescription  would have been better left  unsaid, but it scarcely\r\n\namounts to reversible error.\r\n\n          Statements that  are  made by  a  judge in  the  jury's\r\n\npresence are, of course, subjected to stricter scrutiny.  In this\r\n\ncase,  the judge  was  sharply critical     for example  he  made\r\n\nremarks to  the effect that Stockwell-Alpert  was hurting himself\r\n\nby making unnecessary comments after rulings, talking back to the\r\n\ncourt, leading witnesses on  direct examination, and hollering at\r\n\nan adverse witness    but the criticisms were largely  invited by\r\n\ncounsel's antics and were fairly calculated to maintain courtroom\r\n\ndecorum.4   While the judge could perhaps have been more delicate\r\n\nin  his choice of phrase,  appellate courts cannot  expect that a\r\n\ntrial judge, under siege, will function as a bloodless automaton.\r\n\nSee Polito, 854  F.2d at 418.   Granting the  judge a \"margin  of\r                    \r\n\nhumanity,\" id.,  we do not  think that his comments  in this case\r                        \r\n\nevinced  bias.   See Mitchell v.  Kirk, 20 F.3d  936, 937-38 (8th\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1994); see also Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555-56 (explaining that\r                                      \r\n\nroutine  efforts at court administration by a judge do not evince\r\n\nbias or partiality).   In any event, gauging the likely impact of\r\n\nthe judge's statements on the record as a whole, we conclude that\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4On one occasion, the  judge imposed a monetary sanction  on\r\nStockwell-Alpert for making a wholly gratuitous comment after the\r\njudge had  instructed the jury on  a point of law.   This comment\r\nwas preceded  by several similar comments  which could reasonably\r\nbe viewed as  tending to  disparage the judge  and undermine  his\r\nauthority.  The sanction was imposed outside the jury's presence.\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nthey  did   not  compromise  the  fundamental   fairness  of  the\r\n\nproceedings.  See Deary, 9 F.3d at 195-96.\r                                 \r\n\n          We  add a coda.   In assessing the  impact of a judge's\r\n\nactions,  jury instructions can be  a means of allaying potential\r\n\nprejudice.   See id. at 196; Polito, 856  F.2d at 419.  Here, the\r                                             \r\n\njudge told the  jurors in his charge that he  had not intended to\r\n\ncomment on the evidence or  to suggest \"what verdict I  think you\r\n\nshould  find.\"  He  also told them  that, if they  thought he had\r\n\ncommented,  they  should disregard  the  comments.   Finally,  he\r\n\nwarned the  jurors \"not  [to] be swayed  by bias or  prejudice or\r\n\nfavor as to any  party,\" and stressed their prerogatives  as \"the\r\n\nsole and exclusive judges of the facts.\"  These instructions were\r\n\nsufficient to palliate any untoward effects.\r\n\nIV.  THE EVANESCENT FEE DISPUTE\r          IV.  THE EVANESCENT FEE DISPUTE\r\n\n          After the jury returned  its verdict, a curious episode\r\n\noccurred.    The  judge  made an  extemporaneous  (and  extremely\r\n\nunflattering)  assessment  of  Logue's  case,5  and spontaneously\r\n\ndirected Dore's  counsel to  \"charge all expenses  and reasonable\r\n\nattorneys'  fees to th[e] plaintiff.\"  The judge then granted the\r\n\ndefendant's oral motion to attach  the plaintiff's real estate in\r\n\nthe amount of $50,000  as security for those fees  and expenses.6\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5The  judge  volunteered  his  opinion that  the  case  \"was\r\nbottomed on perjury\" and  that it represented \"an attempt  on the\r\npart  of  this plaintiff  .  . .  to  perpetrate a  fraud  on the\r\nsystem.\"\r\n\n     6Despite his  scathing critique  of Logue's case,  the judge\r\nnever indicated the legal basis on which the anticipated shifting\r\nof fees  rested.   In    a \"best  case\"  scenario, this  lack  of\r\nspecificity  creates potential  problems for  a reviewing  court.\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nDore recorded  the attachment but never filed  an application for\r\n\nattorneys' fees.\r\n\n          Although the  parties argue  in their briefs  about the\r\n\n\"fee  award,\"  it is  apparent that  none  exists.   The district\r\n\ncourt's  announcement of a  willingness to tax  fees and expenses\r\n\nagainst a losing party does not constitute an award,  and, in the\r\n\nabsence of an  order or  judgment susceptible  of execution,  the\r\n\ncourt's free-floating announcement of its views provides no basis\r\n\nfor appellate  intervention.  After all,  appellate courts review\r\n\norders  and  judgments,  not  judge's  statements.    See  In  re\r                                                                           \r\n\nAdministrative  Warrant, 585  F.2d  1152, 1153  (1st Cir.  1978).\r                                 \r\n\nMoreover,  the   defendant  effectively  waived   the  right   to\r\n\nattorneys'  fees  by his  conceded failure  to  file and  serve a\r\n\nproperly supported application within  fourteen days of the entry\r\n\nof   judgment.    See  Fed.   R.  Civ.  P.   54(d).    Under  the\r                               \r\n\ncircumstances, an  attachment, designed to secure  an anticipated\r\n\naward  of fees which was never  reduced to judgment and for which\r\n\nthe prevailing party never applied, cannot stand.\r\n\n          In  the  interest of  completeness,  we  note that,  in\r\n\nresponse  to  vigorous  questioning  on this  point  during  oral\r\n\nargument,  defense counsel  conceded the  untenability  of Dore's\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nSee,  e.g., Foster v. Mydas  Assocs., Inc., 943  F.2d 139, 141-42\r                                                    \r\n(1st Cir.  1991) (holding that a  district court must,  at a bare\r\nminimum,   identify   the  source   of  the   presumed  authority\r\nundergirding  a fee  award, for  \"different sources  of authority\r\nimpose    varying    criteria   for    judging    the   [award's]\r\nappropriateness\").  Here, however, the judge never made an actual\r\nfee  award, see infra, and  we are thus  spared the necessity for\r                               \r\ngrappling with these problems today.\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nposition and agreed to move promptly to dissolve the  attachment.\r\n\nWe have  received a copy of  a letter reporting that  he has kept\r\n\nhis promise.  Nothing remains of this issue.\r\n\nV.  CONCLUSION\r          V.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go  no further.7  The judgment in  favor of the\r\n\ndefendant is  not infected  by reversible  error.   The  district\r\n\ncourt's impromptu direction for  the shifting of fees  is without\r\n\nindependent force as a judgment or order; and, because steps have\r\n\nbeen  taken  to dissolve  the  ensuing  attachment, the  parties'\r\n\ndispute  over  attorneys' fees  presents  no  issue suitable  for\r\n\nappellate review.\r\n\n          The judgment  is affirmed  on the  merits.  Each  party\r                    The judgment  is affirmed  on the  merits.  Each  party\r                                                                           \r\n\nshall bear his own costs.\r          shall bear his own costs.\r                                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     7In his brief, Dore  requests that we invoke Fed. R. App. P.\r\n38  and  impose sanctions  on  the  plaintiff for  prosecuting  a\r\nfrivolous appeal.  We are not inclined to do so.  The plaintiff's\r\narguments concerning the conduct of the trial are colorable, even\r\nthough  not persuasive, and his assignment of error vis- -vis the\r\nimprovidently issued attachment possesses obvious merit.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n",

We decline the invitation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since one of Logue's principal complaints is that the district court took his false arrest and false imprisonment claims from the jury at the close of his case in chief, we assay the facts in the perspective most advantageous to Logue's position.  See, e.g., Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1375 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, Logue and his wife became embroiled in divorce proceedings.  Despite this discord, the couple continued for a time to share the marital domicile at 411 School St., Marshfield, Massachusetts.  The situation changed on November 13, 1992, when Mrs. Logue secured an ex parte restraining order barring her estranged husband from the School St. premises.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Pursuant to that order the Marshfield police asked Logue to remove himself from the property, and he complied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three days later Logue prevailed upon the state court to amend its November 13 order.  The amendment gave Logue access to the premises between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. so that he could continue to operate his painting business (which was based in a garage on the property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the amended order expired on December 2, 1992.  On that date, the state court convened a hearing to determine inter alia whether the restraining order should remain in effect, and if so, whether Logue should still be allowed limited access to the marital premises.  The parties and their counsel appeared but, when the judge reserved decision, Logue and his lawyer departed without awaiting the ruling.  Late that same morning the judge renewed the original restraining order, thereby effectively rescinding Logue's daytime privileges and banning him from the premises in toto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unaware that a completely prohibitory order had issued, Logue repaired to School St. on December 2.  His wife returned that afternoon, told him of the judge's decision, and asked that he leave.  Logue continued working.  Disquieted, Mrs. Logue called the Marshfield police to report what she viewed as a blatant violation of the new restraining order.  Officer Ronald Dore responded to the call.  When Dore arrived, Mrs. Logue showed him a copy of the current restraining order.  By that time, however, Logue had evacuated the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After leaving the scene Logue contacted his attorney in an effort to ascertain the terms of the new restrainer.  He received no definitive guidance.  Instead, his lawyer instructed him to stop by his office the next morning so that they could straighten out the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of form, a restraining order of this sort is composed of a series of multicolored carbon copies to be distributed to various parties.  Typically, there is a copy for the court's use, one for the probation department's use, one for the plaintiff, one for the defendant, one for the local police department, and a final copy on which the return of service is to be inscribed.  Early on the morning of December 3, Dore reviewed the police copy of the newly minted restraining order.  He then proceeded on routine patrol.  In the meantime Logue bypassed his lawyer's office, returned to the marital residence, and resumed work.  Dore observed Logue's vehicle in the driveway, confronted him in the garage, and--turning a deaf ear to Logue's protest that he had the right to be on the property during the day, and that he could verify his status by a telephone call--placed him under arrest for violating the restraining order.  Dore transported Logue to police headquarters and booked him.  Logue was then taken to the state court and arraigned.  Eventually, the charges against him were dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logue mounted a counterattack, suing Dore for damages under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 in the federal district court.  His complaint contained three counts that are germane to this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In those counts Logue contended that Dore had falsely arrested and imprisoned him, and had employed excessive force, all in derogation of section 1983.  During trial, the district court directed a verdict in the defendant's favor on the false arrest and false imprisonment counts.  The jury subsequently found for the defendant on the excessive force claim.  Following a peculiar colloquy related to fees and costs (described infra Part IV), Logue filed this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE DIRECTED VERDICT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logue assigns error to the entry of judgment as a matter of law on the false arrest and false imprisonment claims, asserting that he adduced enough evidence to create a jury question as to whether Dore had probable cause to arrest him.  The standard under which we review Logue's challenge is so familiar that it verges on the banal:  without taking into consideration the credibility of witnesses, resolving conflicts in testimony, or evaluating the weight of the evidence, could a reasonable jury find for the plaintiff on the proof presented?   See Gibson v. City of Cranston, 37 F.3d 731, 735 (1st Cir.1994).  We will affirm the judgment only if, after surveying the evidence and the inferences derivable therefrom in the light most flattering to the plaintiff, we determine that a rational factfinder could have reached no conclusion except that the plaintiff take nothing.  See Veranda Beach, 936 F.2d at 1375;  Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 200 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In trying the false arrest and false imprisonment counts, Logue's theory was that Dore violated his Fourth Amendment rights by arresting him without probable cause.  According to Logue, there was no probable cause because Dore lacked any reason to believe that Logue knew the terms of the December 2 restraining order and intentionally violated it.  The lower court rejected this premise.  So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutionality of a warrantless arrest \"depends ... upon whether, at the moment the arrest was made, the officer[ ] had probable cause to make it.\"  Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 225, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964).  In turn, probable cause to make an arrest exists if--and only if--the facts and circumstances of which the arresting officer has knowledge are sufficient to lead an ordinarily prudent officer to conclude that an offense has been, is being, or is about to be committed, and that the putative arrestee is involved in the crime's commission.  See Rivera v. Murphy, 979 F.2d 259, 263 (1st Cir.1992);  Hoffman v. Reali, 973 F.2d 980, 985 (1st Cir.1992).  In sum, the existence of probable cause (and, in turn, the validity of an ensuing arrest) is gauged by an objective standard;  as long as the circumstances surrounding the event warrant the officer's reasonable belief that the action taken is appropriate, the arrest is justified.  See Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 137-38, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 1723, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978);  United States v. Figueroa, 818 F.2d 1020, 1023 (1st Cir.1987);  see also Whren v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996) (holding that \"[s]ubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis\").  And, moreover, though probable cause requires more than mere suspicion, it does not require the same quantum of proof as is needed to convict.  See United States v. Aguirre, 839 F.2d 854, 857-58 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush it appears that Dore surpassed this minimum.  After all, the evidence is straightforward that an unqualified chapter 209A restraining order issued on December 2, and that order, by its terms, barred Logue from the School St. property.  The record is equally pellucid that Dore learned the terms of that order on two separate occasions before taking action.  Thus, Dore knew prior to arresting Logue that Logue's mere presence on the School St. premises transgressed the restraining order and thereby constituted a criminal act.  In the lower court's view, no more was exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logue seeks to blunt the force of this reasoning by elevating the probable cause threshold.  He would have us rule that, in addition to the arresting officer's reasonable belief that the restraining order was being violated, probable cause in this case could only be established if the officer also believed that the violator himself knew the terms of the order.  But this embellishment has no basis in the law.  What the arrestee knows or does not know at the time of his apprehension is irrelevant to the question of whether the arresting officer has probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be frank, we find it difficult to understand the nexus that Logue strives to fashion between the arrestee's knowledge and the probable cause determination.  It seems most likely that Logue has confused the elements necessary to establish probable cause with the elements necessary to determine guilt or innocence.  The arrestee's knowledge is, of course, relevant to the latter determination, for the Commonwealth, in order to convict Logue of violating the chapter 209A restraining order, would be required to show scienter, that is, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had knowledge or notice that such an order had been issued against him.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 209A, &#167; 7 (West 1996);  Commonwealth v. Gordon, 407 Mass. 340, 553 N.E.2d 915, 918-19 &amp; n. 3 (1990).  Nevertheless, this requirement has no bearing on the reasonableness of Dore's belief that a crime was being committed (especially since he, himself, had told Logue what the order provided), and it therefore fails to address the existence vel non of probable cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  In light of the facts and circumstances unquestionably known to Dore at the time of the arrest, no reasonable jury could find that he lacked probable cause to take Logue into custody.  It follows inexorably that the district court appropriately granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendant on the false arrest and false imprisonment counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE JUDGE'S ATTITUDE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logue's next assignment of error sweeps more broadly.  He contends that the district judge's biased attitude and heavy-handed manner deprived him of an impartial trial, and that fundamental fairness demands that we wipe the slate clean.  These are serious charges, and we treat them as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with an overview of the settled legal principles that pertain to claims of this genre.  It is well-established that a judge is not a mere umpire;  he is \"the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct,\" and has a perfect right--albeit a right that should be exercised with care--to participate actively in the trial proper.  Quercia v. United States, 289 U.S. 466, 469, 53 S.Ct. 698, 698, 77 L.Ed. 1321 (1933).  It is, moreover, beyond cavil that a trial judge in the federal system retains the common law power to question witnesses and to analyze, dissect, explain, summarize, and comment on the evidence.  See id.;   see also United States v. Paiva, 892 F.2d 148, 159 (1st Cir.1989);  see generally Fed.R.Evid. 614(b).  Still, there are lines which a trial judge should not cross.  For example, the judge's participation must be balanced;  he cannot become an advocate or otherwise use his judicial powers to advantage or disadvantage a party unfairly.  See Quercia, 289 U.S. at 470, 53 S.Ct. at 699;  Paiva, 892 F.2d at 159;  see also Fed.R.Evid. 614(b) advisory committee's note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An inquiry into the judge's conduct of the trial necessarily turns on the question of whether the complaining party can show serious prejudice.  See Aggarwal v. Ponce Sch. of Med., 837 F.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir.1988).  In answering this question a reviewing court must evaluate the judge's actions \"according to a standard of fairness and impartiality, recognizing that each case tends to be fact-specific.\"  United States v. Polito, 856 F.2d 414, 418 (1st Cir.1988) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  This process requires the reviewing court to differentiate between expressions of impatience, annoyance or ire, on the one hand, and bias or partiality, on the other hand.  See Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1157, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).  While the former are not to be encouraged, the latter are flatly prohibited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Logue contends that the judge's comments, questioning of witnesses, and chastisement of his trial counsel (Attorney Stockwell-Alpert) skewed the proceedings.  Having painstakingly reviewed the transcript of this five-day trial, we are satisfied that the incidents of which Logue complains show little more than the judge's efforts to clarify testimony, expedite the trial, and maintain courtroom decorum.  In short, we find that Logue received a fair trial, albeit not a perfect or an unblemished one.  He was not entitled to more.  See Polito, 856 F.2d at 418.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no need to cite book and verse in response to each of Logue's criticisms.  A summary should suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Logue asserts that the judge exhibited bias both by interjecting hostile questions during his testimony and by treating the defendant's testimony solicitously.  However, a close reading of the transcript reveals no such contrast.  A judge has wide discretion to interject questions in order to throw light upon testimony or expedite the pace of a trial.  See Deary v. City of Gloucester, 9 F.3d 191, 194-95 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Olmstead, 832 F.2d 642, 648 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1009, 108 S.Ct. 1739, 100 L.Ed.2d 202 (1988).  Here, the judge's questions strike us as designed to simplify the jury's task, and, in respect to Logue's testimony, to clarify his frequently vague and confusing answers.  Many of the judge's queries did no more than restate the examiner's questions, and his oft-uttered responses (e.g., \"all right\" or \"I see\") to Logue's answers were well within the realm of impartiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Logue's claim that the judge displayed bias against him rests heavily on two comments.  First, the judge referred to Logue in the jury's presence as \"the accuser.\"   We regard the comment as innocuous, particularly when its likely impact is evaluated on the entire record.  More troubling is that, after Logue completed his testimony, the judge excused the jury and made the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>I just want to put it on the record that I totally disbelieve the plaintiff in this case.  I think he's an absolute and incorrigible liar.  And it's my intention at the conclusion of this case to request the United States Attorney to conduct an investigation into these matters relative to seeking an indictment for perjury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, it was unnecessary for the judge to go on record at that stage, but his comments indicate no more than that he had grave doubts anent Logue's credibility.  Judges are not expected to refrain from forming opinions about witnesses' credibility--how else would a judge be able to decide a case or pass on a motion for a new trial?--and the mere fact that the judge voices his opinion out of the presence of the jury does not irretrievably taint the trial.  Cf. Liteky, 510 U.S. at 550-51, 114 S.Ct. at 1155 (\"The judge who presides at a trial may, upon completion of the evidence, be exceedingly ill disposed towards the defendant, who has been shown to be a thoroughly reprehensible person.  But the judge is not thereby recusable for bias or prejudice, since his knowledge and the opinion it produced were properly and necessarily acquired in the course of the proceedings....\").  Since there is no evidence that the judge allowed his low opinion of Logue's veracity to mar his conduct of the trial, we will not disturb the judgment.  Logue was entitled to an impartial judge;  he was not entitled to an ingenuous one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Logue further contends that the judge's disparagement of Stockwell-Alpert deprived him of a fair trial.  As a general rule, a judge's mid-trial remarks critical of counsel are insufficient to sustain a claim of judicial bias or partiality against the client.  See Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. at 1157.   This case is no exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the challenged comments occurred at various times, some at sidebar and some in the presence of the jury.  The comments at sidebar need not detain us;  it suffices to say that none were beyond the pale.  In the most ill-advised such remark, the judge referred to the lawyer as a \"smart little guy.\"   The description would have been better left unsaid, but it scarcely amounts to reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statements that are made by a judge in the jury's presence are, of course, subjected to stricter scrutiny.  In this case, the judge was sharply critical--for example he made remarks to the effect that Stockwell-Alpert was hurting himself by making unnecessary comments after rulings, talking back to the court, leading witnesses on direct examination, and hollering at an adverse witness--but the criticisms were largely invited by counsel's antics and were fairly calculated to maintain courtroom decorum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  While the judge could perhaps have been more delicate in his choice of phrase, appellate courts cannot expect that a trial judge, under siege, will function as a bloodless automaton.  See Polito, 856 F.2d at 418.   Granting the judge a \"margin of humanity,\" id., we do not think that his comments in this case evinced bias.  See Mitchell v. Kirk, 20 F.3d 936, 937-38 (8th Cir.1994);  see also Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555-56, 114 S.Ct. at 1157 (explaining that routine efforts at court administration by a judge do not evince bias or partiality).  In any event, gauging the likely impact of the judge's statements on the record as a whole, we conclude that they did not compromise the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.  See Deary, 9 F.3d at 195-96.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda.  In assessing the impact of a judge's actions, jury instructions can be a means of allaying potential prejudice.  See id. at 196;  Polito, 856 F.2d at 419.   Here, the judge told the jurors in his charge that he had not intended to comment on the evidence or to suggest \"what verdict I think you should find.\"   He also told them that, if they thought he had commented, they should disregard the comments.  Finally, he warned the jurors \"not [to] be swayed by bias or prejudice or favor as to any party,\" and stressed their prerogatives as \"the sole and exclusive judges of the facts.\"   These instructions were sufficient to palliate any untoward effects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE EVANESCENT FEE DISPUTE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury returned its verdict, a curious episode occurred.  The judge made an extemporaneous (and extremely unflattering) assessment of Logue's case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and spontaneously directed Dore's counsel to \"charge all expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees to th[e] plaintiff.\"   The judge then granted the defendant's oral motion to attach the plaintiff's real estate in the amount of $50,000 as security for those fees and expenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Dore recorded the attachment but never filed an application for attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties argue in their briefs about the \"fee award,\" it is apparent that none exists.  The district court's announcement of a willingness to tax fees and expenses against a losing party does not constitute an award, and, in the absence of an order or judgment susceptible of execution, the court's free-floating announcement of its views provides no basis for appellate intervention.  After all, appellate courts review orders and judgments, not judge's statements.  See In re Administrative Warrant, 585 F.2d 1152, 1153 (1st Cir.1978).  Moreover, the defendant effectively waived the right to attorneys' fees by his conceded failure to file and serve a properly supported application within fourteen days of the entry of judgment.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d).  Under the circumstances, an attachment, designed to secure an anticipated award of fees which was never reduced to judgment and for which the prevailing party never applied, cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interest of completeness, we note that, in response to vigorous questioning on this point during oral argument, defense counsel conceded the untenability of Dore's position and agreed to move promptly to dissolve the attachment.  We have received a copy of a letter reporting that he has kept his promise.  Nothing remains of this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The judgment in favor of the defendant is not infected by reversible error.  The district court's impromptu direction for the shifting of fees is without independent force as a judgment or order;  and, because steps have been taken to dissolve the ensuing attachment, the parties' dispute over attorneys' fees presents no issue suitable for appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed on the merits.

In this situation, however, further investigation merely would have buttressed the officer's belief and confirmed Logue's violation of the chapter 209A restraining order.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since one of Logue's principal complaints is that the district court took his false arrest and false imprisonment claims from the jury at the close of his case in chief, we assay the facts in the perspective most advantageous to Logue's position.  See, e.g., Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563774\"><a href=\"/opinion/563774/veranda-beach-club-limited-partnership-v-western-surety-co-frg-ventures/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span>, 1375 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1990, Logue and his wife became embroiled in divorce proceedings.  Despite this discord, the couple continued for a time to share the marital domicile at 411 School St., Marshfield, Massachusetts.  The situation changed on November 13, 1992, when Mrs. Logue secured an ex parte restraining order barring her estranged husband from the School St. premises.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Pursuant to that order the Marshfield police asked Logue to remove himself from the property, and he complied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Three days later Logue prevailed upon the state court to amend its November 13 order.  The amendment gave Logue access to the premises between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. so that he could continue to operate his painting business (which was based in a garage on the property).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, the amended order expired on December 2, 1992.  On that date, the state court convened a hearing to determine inter alia whether the restraining order should remain in effect, and if so, whether Logue should still be allowed limited access to the marital premises.  The parties and their counsel appeared but, when the judge reserved decision, Logue and his lawyer departed without awaiting the ruling.  Late that same morning the judge renewed the original restraining order, thereby effectively rescinding Logue's daytime privileges and banning him from the premises in toto.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unaware that a completely prohibitory order had issued, Logue repaired to School St. on December 2.  His wife returned that afternoon, told him of the judge's decision, and asked that he leave.  Logue continued working.  Disquieted, Mrs. Logue called the Marshfield police to report what she viewed as a blatant violation of the new restraining order.  Officer Ronald Dore responded to the call.  When Dore arrived, Mrs. Logue showed him a copy of the current restraining order.  By that time, however, Logue had evacuated the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After leaving the scene Logue contacted his attorney in an effort to ascertain the terms of the new restrainer.  He received no definitive guidance.  Instead, his lawyer instructed him to stop by his office the next morning so that they could straighten out the situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a matter of form, a restraining order of this sort is composed of a series of multicolored carbon copies to be distributed to various parties.  Typically, there is a copy for the court's use, one for the probation department's use, one for the plaintiff, one for the defendant, one for the local police department, and a final copy on which the return of service is to be inscribed.  Early on the morning of December 3, Dore reviewed the police copy of the newly minted restraining order.  He then proceeded on routine patrol.  In the meantime Logue bypassed his lawyer's office, returned to the marital residence, and resumed work.  Dore observed Logue's vehicle in the driveway, confronted him in the garage, and--turning a deaf ear to Logue's protest that he had the right to be on the property during the day, and that he could verify his status by a telephone call--placed him under arrest for violating the restraining order.  Dore transported Logue to police headquarters and booked him.  Logue was then taken to the state court and arraigned.  Eventually, the charges against him were dropped.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logue mounted a counterattack, suing Dore for damages under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 in the federal district court.  His complaint contained three counts that are germane to this appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  In those counts Logue contended that Dore had falsely arrested and imprisoned him, and had employed excessive force, all in derogation of section 1983.  During trial, the district court directed a verdict in the defendant's favor on the false arrest and false imprisonment counts.  The jury subsequently found for the defendant on the excessive force claim.  Following a peculiar colloquy related to fees and costs (described infra Part IV), Logue filed this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE DIRECTED VERDICT</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logue assigns error to the entry of judgment as a matter of law on the false arrest and false imprisonment claims, asserting that he adduced enough evidence to create a jury question as to whether Dore had probable cause to arrest him.  The standard under which we review Logue's challenge is so familiar that it verges on the banal:  without taking into consideration the credibility of witnesses, resolving conflicts in testimony, or evaluating the weight of the evidence, could a reasonable jury find for the plaintiff on the proof presented?   See Gibson v. City of Cranston, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195652\"><a href=\"/opinion/195652/gibson-v-city-of-cranston/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 735 (1st Cir.1994).  We will affirm the judgment only if, after surveying the evidence and the inferences derivable therefrom in the light most flattering to the plaintiff, we determine that a rational factfinder could have reached no conclusion except that the plaintiff take nothing.  See Veranda Beach, 936 F.2d at 1375;  Wagenmann v. Adams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 200 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In trying the false arrest and false imprisonment counts, Logue's theory was that Dore violated his Fourth Amendment rights by arresting him without probable cause.  According to Logue, there was no probable cause because Dore lacked any reason to believe that Logue knew the terms of the December 2 restraining order and intentionally violated it.  The lower court rejected this premise.  So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The constitutionality of a warrantless arrest \"depends ... upon whether, at the moment the arrest was made, the officer[ ] had probable cause to make it.\"  Beck v. Ohio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span> (1964).  In turn, probable cause to make an arrest exists if--and only if--the facts and circumstances of which the arresting officer has knowledge are sufficient to lead an ordinarily prudent officer to conclude that an offense has been, is being, or is about to be committed, and that the putative arrestee is involved in the crime's commission.  See Rivera v. Murphy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"594699\"><a href=\"/opinion/594699/emma-rivera-v-paul-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">979</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">259</span></a></span>, 263 (1st Cir.1992);  Hoffman v.

In sum, the existence of probable cause (and, in turn, the validity of an ensuing arrest) is gauged by an objective standard;  as long as the circumstances surrounding the event warrant the officer's reasonable belief that the action taken is appropriate, the arrest is justified.  See Scott v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109860\"><a href=\"/opinion/109860/scott-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 137-38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109860\"><a href=\"/opinion/109860/scott-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span> (1996) (holding that \"[s]ubjective intentions play no role in ordinary, probable-cause Fourth Amendment analysis\").  And, moreover, though probable cause requires more than mere suspicion, it does not require the same quantum of proof as is needed to convict.  See United States v. Aguirre, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501807\"><a href=\"/opinion/501807/united-states-v-luis-a-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">854</span></a></span>, 857-58 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At first blush it appears that Dore surpassed this minimum.  After all, the evidence is straightforward that an unqualified chapter 209A restraining order issued on December 2, and that order, by its terms, barred Logue from the School St. property.  The record is equally pellucid that Dore learned the terms of that order on two separate occasions before taking action.  Thus, Dore knew prior to arresting Logue that Logue's mere presence on the School St. premises transgressed the restraining order and thereby constituted a criminal act.  In the lower court's view, no more was exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logue seeks to blunt the force of this reasoning by elevating the probable cause threshold.  He would have us rule that, in addition to the arresting officer's reasonable belief that the restraining order was being violated, probable cause in this case could only be established if the officer also believed that the violator himself knew the terms of the order.  But this embellishment has no basis in the law.  What the arrestee knows or does not know at the time of his apprehension is irrelevant to the question of whether the arresting officer has probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be frank, we find it difficult to understand the nexus that Logue strives to fashion between the arrestee's knowledge and the probable cause determination.  It seems most likely that Logue has confused the elements necessary to establish probable cause with the elements necessary to determine guilt or innocence.  The arrestee's knowledge is, of course, relevant to the latter determination, for the Commonwealth, in order to convict Logue of violating the chapter 209A restraining order, would be required to show scienter, that is, to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had knowledge or notice that such an order had been issued against him.  See Mass.Gen.L. ch. 209A, &#167; 7 (West 1996);  Commonwealth v. Gordon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2155698\"><a href=\"/opinion/2155698/commonwealth-v-gordon/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">340</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2155698\"><a href=\"/opinion/2155698/commonwealth-v-gordon/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span>, 918-19 &amp; n. 3 (1990).  Nevertheless, this requirement has no bearing on the reasonableness of Dore's belief that a crime was being committed (especially since he, himself, had told Logue what the order provided), and it therefore fails to address the existence vel non of probable cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  In light of the facts and circumstances unquestionably known to Dore at the time of the arrest, no reasonable jury could find that he lacked probable cause to take Logue into custody.  It follows inexorably that the district court appropriately granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendant on the false arrest and false imprisonment counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE JUDGE'S ATTITUDE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Logue's next assignment of error sweeps more broadly.  He contends that the district judge's biased attitude and heavy-handed manner deprived him of an impartial trial, and that fundamental fairness demands that we wipe the slate clean.  These are serious charges, and we treat them as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with an overview of the settled legal principles that pertain to claims of this genre.  It is well-established that a judge is not a mere umpire;  he is \"the governor of the trial for the purpose of assuring its proper conduct,\" and has a perfect right--albeit a right that should be exercised with care--to participate actively in the trial proper.  Quercia v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102106\"><a href=\"/opinion/102106/quercia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, 469, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102106\"><a href=\"/opinion/102106/quercia-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1321</span></a></span> (1933).  It is, moreover, beyond cavil that a trial judge in the federal system retains the common law power to question witnesses and to analyze, dissect, explain, summarize, and comment on the evidence.  See id.;   see also United States v. Paiva, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534182\"><a href=\"/opinion/534182/united-states-v-james-earl-paiva/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 159 (1st Cir.1989);  see generally Fed.R.Evid. 614(b).  Still, there are lines which a trial judge should not cross.  For example, the judge's participation must be balanced;  he cannot become an advocate or otherwise use his judicial powers to advantage or disadvantage a party unfairly.  See Quercia, 289 U.S. at 470, 53 S.Ct. at 699;  Paiva, 892 F.2d at 159;  see also Fed.R.Evid. 614(b) advisory committee's note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An inquiry into the judge's conduct of the trial necessarily turns on the question of whether the complaining party can show serious prejudice.  See Aggarwal v. Ponce Sch. of Med., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500041\"><a href=\"/opinion/500041/deep-aggarwal-v-ponce-school-of-medicine/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir.1988).  In answering this question a reviewing court must evaluate the judge's actions \"according to a standard of fairness and impartiality, recognizing that each case tends to be fact-specific.\"  United States v. Polito, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"511568\"><a href=\"/opinion/511568/united-states-v-john-d-polito/\"><span class=\"volume\">856</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">414</span></a></span>, 418 (1st Cir.1988) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  This process requires the reviewing court to differentiate between expressions of impatience, annoyance or ire, on the one hand, and bias or partiality, on the other hand.  See Liteky v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">540</span></a></span>, 555-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112935\"><a href=\"/opinion/112935/liteky-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span> (1994).  While the former are not to be encouraged, the latter are flatly prohibited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Logue contends that the judge's comments, questioning of witnesses, and chastisement of his trial counsel (Attorney Stockwell-Alpert) skewed the proceedings.  Having painstakingly reviewed the transcript of this five-day trial, we are satisfied that the incidents of which Logue complains show little more than the judge's efforts to clarify testimony, expedite the trial, and maintain courtroom decorum.  In short, we find that Logue received a fair trial, albeit not a perfect or an unblemished one.  He was not entitled to more.  See Polito, 856 F.2d at 418.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no need to cite book and verse in response to each of Logue's criticisms.  A summary should suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Logue asserts that the judge exhibited bias both by interjecting hostile questions during his testimony and by treating the defendant's testimony solicitously.  However, a close reading of the transcript reveals no such contrast.  A judge has wide discretion to interject questions in order to throw light upon testimony or expedite the pace of a trial.  See Deary v. City of Gloucester, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195029\"><a href=\"/opinion/195029/deary-v-city-of-gloucester/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span>, 194-95 (1st Cir.1993);  United States v. Olmstead, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496773\"><a href=\"/opinion/496773/united-states-v-george-olmstead/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span>, 648 (1st Cir.1987), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1739</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></span> (1988).  Here, the judge's questions strike us as designed to simplify the jury's task, and, in respect to Logue's testimony, to clarify his frequently vague and confusing answers.  Many of the judge's queries did no more than restate the examiner's questions, and his oft-uttered responses (e.g., \"all right\" or \"I see\") to Logue's answers were well within the realm of impartiality.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Logue's claim that the judge displayed bias against him rests heavily on two comments.  First, the judge referred to Logue in the jury's presence as \"the accuser.\"   We regard the comment as innocuous, particularly when its likely impact is evaluated on the entire record.  More troubling is that, after Logue completed his testimony, the judge excused the jury and made the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>I just want to put it on the record that I totally disbelieve the plaintiff in this case.  I think he's an absolute and incorrigible liar.  And it's my intention at the conclusion of this case to request the United States Attorney to conduct an investigation into these matters relative to seeking an indictment for perjury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, it was unnecessary for the judge to go on record at that stage, but his comments indicate no more than that he had grave doubts anent Logue's credibility.  Judges are not expected to refrain from forming opinions about witnesses' credibility--how else would a judge be able to decide a case or pass on a motion for a new trial?--and the mere fact that the judge voices his opinion out of the presence of the jury does not irretrievably taint the trial.  Cf. Liteky, 510 U.S. at 550-51, 114 S.Ct. at 1155 (\"The judge who presides at a trial may, upon completion of the evidence, be exceedingly ill disposed towards the defendant, who has been shown to be a thoroughly reprehensible person.  But the judge is not thereby recusable for bias or prejudice, since his knowledge and the opinion it produced were properly and necessarily acquired in the course of the proceedings....\").  Since there is no evidence that the judge allowed his low opinion of Logue's veracity to mar his conduct of the trial, we will not disturb the judgment.  Logue was entitled to an impartial judge;  he was not entitled to an ingenuous one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Logue further contends that the judge's disparagement of Stockwell-Alpert deprived him of a fair trial.  As a general rule, a judge's mid-trial remarks critical of counsel are insufficient to sustain a claim of judicial bias or partiality against the client.  See Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555, 114 S.Ct. at 1157.   This case is no exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the challenged comments occurred at various times, some at sidebar and some in the presence of the jury.  The comments at sidebar need not detain us;  it suffices to say that none were beyond the pale.  In the most ill-advised such remark, the judge referred to the lawyer as a \"smart little guy.\"   The description would have been better left unsaid, but it scarcely amounts to reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Statements that are made by a judge in the jury's presence are, of course, subjected to stricter scrutiny.  In this case, the judge was sharply critical--for example he made remarks to the effect that Stockwell-Alpert was hurting himself by making unnecessary comments after rulings, talking back to the court, leading witnesses on direct examination, and hollering at an adverse witness--but the criticisms were largely invited by counsel's antics and were fairly calculated to maintain courtroom decorum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  While the judge could perhaps have been more delicate in his choice of phrase, appellate courts cannot expect that a trial judge, under siege, will function as a bloodless automaton.  See Polito, 856 F.2d at 418.   Granting the judge a \"margin of humanity,\" id., we do not think that his comments in this case evinced bias.  See Mitchell v. Kirk, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666922\"><a href=\"/opinion/666922/carlton-wayne-mitchell-v-jack-kirk-jerome-weiler-vivian-watts-dick-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></a></span>, 937-38 (8th Cir.1994);  see also Liteky, 510 U.S. at 555-56, 114 S.Ct. at 1157 (explaining that routine efforts at court administration by a judge do not evince bias or partiality).  In any event, gauging the likely impact of the judge's statements on the record as a whole, we conclude that they did not compromise the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.  See Deary, 9 F.3d at 195-96.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda.  In assessing the impact of a judge's actions, jury instructions can be a means of allaying potential prejudice.  See id. at 196;  Polito, 856 F.2d at 419.   Here, the judge told the jurors in his charge that he had not intended to comment on the evidence or to suggest \"what verdict I think you should find.\"   He also told them that, if they thought he had commented, they should disregard the comments.  Finally, he warned the jurors \"not [to] be swayed by bias or prejudice or favor as to any party,\" and stressed their prerogatives as \"the sole and exclusive judges of the facts.\"   These instructions were sufficient to palliate any untoward effects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. THE EVANESCENT FEE DISPUTE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the jury returned its verdict, a curious episode occurred.  The judge made an extemporaneous (and extremely unflattering) assessment of Logue's case,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and spontaneously directed Dore's counsel to \"charge all expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees to th[e] plaintiff.\"   The judge then granted the defendant's oral motion to attach the plaintiff's real estate in the amount of $50,000 as security for those fees and expenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  Dore recorded the attachment but never filed an application for attorneys' fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties argue in their briefs about the \"fee award,\" it is apparent that none exists.  The district court's announcement of a willingness to tax fees and expenses against a losing party does not constitute an award, and, in the absence of an order or judgment susceptible of execution, the court's free-floating announcement of its views provides no basis for appellate intervention.  After all, appellate courts review orders and judgments, not judge's statements.  See In re Administrative Warrant, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360384\"><a href=\"/opinion/360384/in-re-administrative-warrant-issued-to-the-food-and-drug-administration-on/\"><span class=\"volume\">585</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></a></span>, 1153 (1st Cir.1978).  Moreover, the defendant effectively waived the right to attorneys' fees by his conceded failure to file and serve a properly supported application within fourteen days of the entry of judgment.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d).  Under the circumstances, an attachment, designed to secure an anticipated award of fees which was never reduced to judgment and for which the prevailing party never applied, cannot stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the interest of completeness, we note that, in response to vigorous questioning on this point during oral argument, defense counsel conceded the untenability of Dore's position and agreed to move promptly to dissolve the attachment.  We have received a copy of a letter reporting that he has kept his promise.  Nothing remains of this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  The judgment in favor of the defendant is not infected by reversible error.  The district court's impromptu direction for the shifting of fees is without independent force as a judgment or order;  and, because steps have been taken to dissolve the ensuing attachment, the parties' dispute over attorneys' fees presents no issue suitable for appellate review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed on the merits.  Each party shall bear his own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Mrs. Logue obtained the restraining order under a state law which provides that, in various situations (including matrimonial disputes), a court \"may enter such temporary orders as it deems necessary to protect a plaintiff from abuse....\"  Mass.Gen.L. ch. 209A, &#167; 4 (West 1996).  The statute further provides that \"[i]f the plaintiff demonstrates a substantial likelihood of immediate danger of abuse, the court may enter such temporary relief orders without notice ... and shall immediately thereafter notify the defendant that the temporary orders have been issued.\"  Id.  In that event, \"[n]otice shall be made by the appropriate law enforcement agency.\"  Id</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Originally, Logue asserted other claims against Dore, various unnamed Marshfield police officers, and the Town of Marshfield.  Because the case proceeded to trial only on the federal claims against Dore, we limit our discussion accordingly</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Logue implies that Dore's refusal to allow him to make a telephone call to verify the terms of the December 2 order made the arrest unreasonable.  To be sure, there are circumstances in which \"an arresting officer may have a duty to pursue further information if it is available and likely to be trustworthy.\"  Palhava de Varella-Cid v. Boston Five Cents Sav. Bank, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"468091\"><a href=\"/opinion/468091/ana-maria-caeiro-palhava-de-varella-cid-v-the-boston-five-cents-savings/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span>, 680 (1st Cir.1986).  In this situation, however, further investigation merely would have buttressed the officer's belief and confirmed Logue's violation of the chapter 209A restraining order.  Thus, Logue's argument is not advanced by Dore's rebuff</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> On one occasion, the judge imposed a monetary sanction on Stockwell-Alpert for making a wholly gratuitous comment after the judge had instructed the jury on a point of law.  This comment was preceded by several similar comments which could reasonably be viewed as tending to disparage the judge and undermine his authority.  The sanction was imposed outside the jury's presence</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The judge volunteered his opinion that the case \"was bottomed on perjury\" and that it represented \"an attempt on the part of this plaintiff ... to perpetrate a fraud on the system.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Despite his scathing critique of Logue's case, the judge never indicated the legal basis on which the anticipated shifting of fees rested.  In a \"best case\" scenario, this lack of specificity creates potential problems for a reviewing court.  See, e.g., Foster v. Mydas Assocs., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567592\"><a href=\"/opinion/567592/darcy-foster-v-mydas-associates-inc-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 141-42 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that a district court must, at a bare minimum, identify the source of the presumed authority undergirding a fee award, for \"different sources of authority impose varying criteria for judging the [award's] appropriateness\").  Here, however, the judge never made an actual fee award, see infra, and we are thus spared the necessity for grappling with these problems today</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In his brief, Dore requests that we invoke Fed.R.App.P. 38 and impose sanctions on the plaintiff for prosecuting a frivolous appeal.  We are not inclined to do so.  The plaintiff's arguments concerning the conduct of the trial are colorable, even though not persuasive, and his assignment of error vis-a-vis the improvidently issued attachment possesses obvious merit</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
