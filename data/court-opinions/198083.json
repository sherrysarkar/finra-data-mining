Nicolas Valladares-\r\nQuintana (\"Valladares\") appeals from his conviction in the district\r\ncourt on one count of money laundering.  He alleges that the\r\ndistrict court abused its discretion by excluding his proffer of\r\nexculpatory evidence, that the evidence was insufficient to\r\nestablish his guilt, and that the court erred when it calculated\r\nhis sentence.  After consideration, we affirm.\r\n\n                           I.\r\nAs appropriate upon an appeal from a criminal conviction,\r\nwe state the facts in the light most favorable to the jury verdict. \r\nSee United States v. Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  The jury could have found the following.\r\nAs part of a federal undercover operation, FBI Special\r\nAgent Martin Suarez infiltrated a money-laundering organization in\r\nPuerto Rico.  That organization received large quantities of United\r\nStates currency generated by cocaine distribution, exchanged the\r\ncurrency for monetary instruments in small denominations, and\r\narranged for transportation of those instruments to Columbia.\r\nBeginning in late 1993, Agent Suarez laundered money for\r\nan organization code-named \"Roberto Diez.\"  Several deliveries of\r\ndrug money from Roberto Diez were made to Agent Suarez.  One such\r\ndelivery was made by Reynaldo Escobar-Mosquera (\"Escobar\"), who was\r\nindicted but testified for the government at Valladares's trial.\r\nThe transaction that involved Valladares took place on\r\nJanuary 17, 1994.  On that date, someone from Roberto Diez paged\r\nAgent Suarez.  Agent Suarez responded by calling a cellular phone\r\nrented to Valladares.  Agent Suarez and Valladares set up a meeting\r\nat which Roberto Diez was to deliver money to Agent Suarez.  Agent\r\nSuarez proceeded to the agreed meeting place, where he saw Escobar\r\nand a then-unidentified man sitting in a black Jeep Cherokee. \r\nAfter Agent Suarez and Escobar exchanged greetings from their\r\nvehicles, the second man got out of the Cherokee carrying a box. \r\nThe second man placed the box, which contained roughly $190,000, on\r\nthe rear passenger seat of Agent Suarez's car.  At that time, Agent\r\nSuarez looked directly at the second man from a distance of\r\napproximately three or four feet.  The second man then got back\r\ninto the Cherokee and drove off with Escobar.  Several weeks later,\r\nwhen Agent Suarez reviewed the driver's license photographs of\r\npersons associated with Escobar's company, \"Hacienda Remini,\" he\r\nidentified Valladares as having been the second man at the January\r\n17 encounter.\r\nThe January 17 delivery was observed by at least two\r\nother witnesses, agents on an FBI surveillance team: Special Agent\r\nAdalberto Rivera and Special Agent Luis Fraticelli.  Agent Rivera\r\nwas parked near the black Jeep Cherokee.  He photographed the\r\ntransaction with a zoom lens from a distance of 100 to 150 feet,\r\nand these photographs were introduced into evidence.  Valladares\r\nappeared in two of the photographs.  At one point, Escobar and\r\nValladares came within fifty feet of Agent Rivera.  Agent\r\nFraticelli observed Valladares not only at the transaction but\r\nafterwards when he followed the black Jeep Cherokee.  Both agents\r\npicked out Valladares's driver's license photo from among several\r\nothers.\r\nValladares and three co-defendants were named in a second\r\nsuperseding indictment returned on September 27, 1995.  Valladares\r\nwas charged with two counts: conspiracy to distribute cocaine and\r\nmoney laundering.  At trial, the government presented the testimony\r\nof Escobar as well as of Agents Suarez, Rivera and Fraticelli.  All\r\nfour witnesses testified that Valladares had participated in the\r\nJanuary 17 delivery.  Further, Escobar testified that he,\r\nValladares, and a man named Miguel Torres, distributed cocaine in\r\nPuerto Rico.  He stated that the three men started a corporation\r\ncalled \"Hacienda Remini,\" a name derived from the first name of\r\neach founder, to launder the money produced by their drug\r\ndistribution.  According to Escobar, Valladares knew the details of\r\nand participated fully in the drug and money-laundering operation.\r\nValladares's defense was that he was unaware of Escobar's\r\ncriminal activities and that the federal agents were mistaken when\r\nthey identified him as a participant at the January 17 delivery. \r\nValladares, and two defense witnesses, testified that Valladares\r\nengaged in only legitimate business and that, to the best of their\r\nknowledge, Escobar had accrued his wealth by gambling.  To show\r\nthat he had been misidentified, Valladares was prepared to testify\r\nthat a United States Customs Service investigation report (the\r\n\"USCS Report\") had incorrectly identified Valladares as the\r\nindividual who delivered $950,000 in currency during a November 25,\r\n1993 money transfer.  Valladares contended that, since the Customs\r\nService used the same identification methodology as did the FBI,\r\nits earlier mistaken identification of him cast doubt on his\r\npresent identification.  In his opening statement, Valladares's\r\nattorney promised the jury that he would present evidence regarding\r\nthe earlier misidentification.  The court, however, excluded the\r\nUSCS Report as lacking in relevance, reasoning that the federal\r\nagents had identified Valladares based on their first-hand\r\nobservations of him during the January 17 transaction.\r\nValladares was convicted of money laundering and\r\nacquitted of the drug conspiracy charge.  The Pre-Sentence Report\r\n(\"PSR\") recommended a base offense level of twenty.  On top of that\r\nbase, the PSR recommended several enhancements.  The first was a\r\nthree-level increase because Valladares knew that the laundered\r\nfunds arose from unlawful activity.  See U.S.S.G.  2S1.1(b)(1). \r\nSecond, the PSR recommended a two-level increase for obstruction of\r\njustice because, it concluded, Valladares had committed perjury by\r\ndenying at trial any involvement in the criminal enterprise.  SeeU.S.S.G.  3C1.1.  Lastly, the PSR included a one-level increase\r\nbecause Valladares laundered more than $100,000 but less than\r\n$200,000.  See U.S.S.G.  2S1.1(b)(2).  The PSR, therefore,\r\nrecommended a total offense level of twenty-six.  In addition, the\r\nPSR indicated a fine range running from a minimum of $12,500 to a\r\nmaximum of $500,000.  See U.S.S.G.  5E1.2(c)(3), 5E1.2(c)(4).\r\nValladares objected in the district court to the two-\r\nlevel adjustment for obstruction of justice and to the inclusion of\r\nacquitted conduct in the PSR.  He did not, however, object to the\r\nthree-level increase based on his knowledge of the criminal nature\r\nof the laundered funds.   Valladares sought an offense level of\r\ntwenty-four, two levels lower than the PSR's recommendation.  The\r\ndistrict court overruled Valladares's objections, sentenced him to\r\nseventy-eight months in prison, and fined him $12,500.  Valladares\r\nappealed.\r\n\n                          II.\r\nA.  Exclusion of the USCS Report.\r\nValladares argues on appeal that the court's exclusion of\r\nthe USCS Report was an abuse of discretion that prevented him from\r\npresenting the \"core\" of his defense to the jury and violated his\r\nSixth Amendment rights.  We review a court's exclusion of evidence\r\nfor abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Brandon, 17 F.3d\r\n409, 444 (1st Cir. 1994).  Even if a lower court abuses its\r\ndiscretion, we will affirm unless the error affected the\r\ndefendant's substantial rights.  See Fed. R. Evid. 103(a).  In a\r\ndirect criminal appeal implicating constitutional rights, we will\r\naffirm if the government shows there was no reasonable possibility\r\nthat the excluded evidence would have affected the jury verdict,\r\ni.e. that any error was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \r\nUnited States v. Mulinelli-Navas, 111 F.3d 983, 992 (1st Cir. 1997)\r\n(quoting  Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\nValladares contends that the USCS Report would reveal\r\nthat he was mis-described as a participant in a November 25 money-\r\nlaundering transaction in Puerto Rico.  Actually, Valladares says\r\nhe was in Miami at the time.  The district court excluded the\r\nreport because of its lack of relevance, stating that Valladares\r\nhad to establish that the agents \"were mistaken because\r\n[Valladares] wasn't there [on January 17,] not because two months\r\nprior other agents made a mistake[] as to his identity.\"  Cf. 2\r\nJoseph M. McLaughlin, Weinstein's Federal Evidence \r\n401.04[2][e][ii], at 401-29 (2d ed. 1997) (\"Evidence, though\r\notherwise relevant, may be excluded because it is too remote in\r\nspace or time from the proposition being proved.\").  When ruling on\r\nremote evidence, the judge must \"weigh its probative value against\r\nthe dangers of unfairness, confusion, and undue expenditure of time\r\non collateral issues.\"  Id.\r\nFor a variety of reasons, we see no abuse of discretion\r\nin the exclusion of the USCS Report.  First, even if it had\r\nrevealed an earlier mistaken identification, we doubt its\r\nrelevance.  Cf. Jordan v. Ducharme, 983 F.2d 933, 938 (9th Cir.\r\n1993) (holding that a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not\r\nviolated by the exclusion of evidence \"that some person, not the\r\nwitnesses in court, had mistakenly identified [the defendant] as\r\nthe robber in other crimes for which he was not being tried\").\r\nMoreover, even supposing arguendo that a\r\nmisidentification made two months earlier has probative value to\r\ndisprove a subsequent identification made by a different agent in\r\na different governmental agency, the USCS Report does not show that\r\nagents mistakenly placed Valladares at the scene on November 25. \r\nThe USCS Report makes reference to the fact that the pagers used to\r\nfacilitate the November deal were rented to Valladares: this did\r\nnot necessarily indicate that Valladares was physically present at\r\nthe November 25 exchange in Puerto Rico.  The participants were\r\ndescribed only as \"two white hispanic males, approximately 45 to 50\r\nyears old.\"  Hence, the USCS Report failed to support even the\r\nquestionable point asserted by the defense.\r\nValladares contends that the USCS Report had relevance\r\nbecause the government was planning to produce its author to\r\ntestify that Valladares participated in the November 25, 1993\r\nincident.  There is simply no record support for this assertion. \r\nThe government denies any such intention and, in any case, no such\r\nwitness was called.\r\nThe USCS Report, in brief, fails even the most basic test\r\nof logical relevance: it does not make a later misidentification\r\nany more or less likely than it would be otherwise.  See Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 401 (noting that the minimum requirement for admissibility is\r\nthat a piece of evidence have a \"tendency to make the existence of\r\nany fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action\r\nmore probable or less probable than it would be without the\r\nevidence\").  Lacking relevance, the report was not admissible,\r\nsee Fed. R. Evid. 402 (\"Evidence which is not relevant is not\r\nadmissible.\").\r\nObviously, the exclusion of immaterial evidence did not\r\nviolate Valladares's constitutional rights.  See Taylor, 484 U.S.\r\nat 410 (\"The accused does not have an unfettered right to offer\r\ntestimony that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise\r\ninadmissible under standard rules of evidence.\"); United States v.\r\nRodriguez Cortes, 949 F.2d 532, 546 (1st Cir. 1991) (finding\r\nharmless error).\r\nB.   Sufficiency of the Evidence.\r\nValladares next argues that the evidence against him was\r\ninsufficient, as a matter of law, to support his conviction for\r\nmoney laundering.  When a defendant brings a sufficiency challenge,\r\n\"our task is to determine whether any rational jury, taking the\r\nevidence in its totality and in the light most flattering to the\r\ngovernment, could have found appellant guilty beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt.\"  United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1990). \r\nIn making this inquiry, we resolve all credibility questions in\r\nfavor of the verdict.  See United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927\r\nF.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nTo prove the money-laundering charge, the government had\r\nto show beyond a reasonable doubt that Valladares, \r\nknowing that the property involved in a\r\nfinancial transaction represents the proceeds\r\nof some form of unlawful activity, conduct[ed]\r\nor attempt[ed] to conduct such a financial\r\ntransaction which in fact involv[ed] the\r\nproceeds of specified illegal activity  \r\n\n(B)  knowing that the transaction [was]\r\n     designed in whole or in part  \r\n\n     (i)  to conceal or disguise the nature,\r\n          the location, the source, the\r\n          ownership, or the control of the\r\n          proceeds of specified unlawful\r\n          activity; . . . .\r\n18 U.S.C.  1956(a)(1); see also Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d at\r\n20-21.  The term \"financial transaction,\" as used in  1956(a)(1),\r\nincludes only dealings that affect \"interstate or foreign\r\ncommerce,\" or that involve \"the use of a financial institution\r\nwhich is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate\r\nor foreign commerce in any way or degree.\"  18 U.S.C.  1956(c)(4).\r\nThe record does not bear out Valladares's contention that\r\nthe government failed to show that the January 17 transaction\r\nimplicated interstate or foreign commerce.  Both Agent Suarez and\r\nanother FBI Agent named Siverio testified that the money they\r\n\"laundered\" was sent to Columbia.  Agent Suarez stated under oath\r\nthat he had sent approximately twenty million dollars out of the\r\ncountry over the years of his undercover investigation.  The\r\nJanuary 17 transaction was merely one more delivery in the series\r\nof FBI deals.  In light of the fact that  1956(a)(1) requires that\r\na transaction have only a de minimis effect on interstate commerce,\r\nsee United States v. Peay, 972 F.2d 71, 74 (4th Cir. 1992), a\r\nreasonable jury could have concluded that the government met its\r\nburden of showing the requisite nexus to interstate commerce.\r\nValladares also argues that his acquittal on the\r\nconspiracy count implies that the government did not prove beyond\r\na reasonable doubt that he knew of the illicit nature of the\r\nlaundered funds or even that the money represented proceeds from a\r\nspecified unlawful activity.  When reviewing the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence, the only question before this court is whether the\r\nevidence at trial could have supported the conviction made.  SeeZannino, 895 F.2d at 9.  Acquittal on one count of a multi-count\r\nindictment is not a factor in this inquiry; sufficiency-of-the-\r\nevidence review \"should be independent of the jury's determination\r\nthat evidence on another count was sufficient.\"  United States v.\r\nPowell, 469 U.S. 57, 67 (1984).  We do not give weight to an\r\nacquittal even where verdicts are logically inconsistent because\r\nsuch verdicts might reflect only that the jury acquitted \"through\r\nmistake, compromise, or lenity.\"  Id.\r\nAs part of its case, the government presented four\r\nwitnesses who testified regarding Valladares's participation in the\r\nJanuary 17 transaction.  The witnesses placed that transaction in\r\nthe context of many similar dealings, all of which had the goal of\r\nfunneling to Columbia money illicitly obtained from cocaine\r\ndistribution.  When Valladares dropped the money into Agent\r\nSuarez's car, he said, \"This is for Flaco,\" a Columbian supplier of\r\ncocaine.  Further, Escobar stated under oath that he and Valladares\r\nwere partners who, for several years, obtained drugs from Columbia,\r\ndistributed those drugs, and collected money for them.  On several\r\noccasions, Escobar and Valladares stored drugs at their home. \r\nEscobar testified as to Valladares's many telephone calls\r\ndiscussing drug and money-laundering transactions and the\r\ngovernment played tapes of those calls at trial.  The record amply\r\nprovides a basis for a jury to conclude that the proceeds were the\r\nfruit of drug-related activity and that Valladares knew that fact.\r\nValladares further contends the government failed to show\r\nthat he knew the transactions were designed to conceal or disguise\r\nthe nature of the money with the aim of converting the fruits of\r\ncriminal enterprise into less detectable forms.  But the government\r\nmet its burden here as well.  A reasonable jury could conclude,\r\nfrom the evidence presented, that Valladares knew of the necessity\r\nfor secrecy.  Escobar testified that he and Valladares kept their\r\ndrug money hidden in the trunk of their car during the day and\r\nslept with it at night.  They did not deposit it in the bank,\r\nEscobar testified, for fear of immediate arrest.  In addition,\r\nValladares took elaborate precautions to make sure that the January\r\n17 transaction was not discovered.  In his telephone call on that\r\nday and calls on other days, he used code words designed to confuse\r\nanyone who might be listening in.  These actions support a finding\r\nthat Valladares intended to conceal the source of the $190,000 that\r\nhe delivered to Agent Suarez.\r\nIn sum, the record contains sufficient evidence to\r\nsupport the jury's guilty verdict.\r\nC.   Two-level Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice.\r\nValladares assails the court's imposition of a two-level\r\nsentence enhancement for obstruction of justice.  See U.S.S.G. \r\n3C1.1.  (increasing by two the offense level of a defendant who\r\n\"willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or\r\nimpede, the administration of justice during the investigation,\r\nprosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\").  Perjury may\r\nbe such an obstruction of justice.  See  U.S.S.G.  3C1.1 comment\r\n(n.3(b)) (stating that the enhancement is triggered by \"committing,\r\nsuborning, or attempting to suborn perjury\"); United States v.\r\nDunnigan, 507 U.S. 87, 98 (1993) (\"Upon a proper determination that\r\nthe accused has committed perjury at trial, an enhancement of\r\nsentence is required by the Sentencing Guidelines [ 3C1.1].\"). \r\nThe court found that Valladares perjured himself by denying at\r\ntrial under oath his presence and participation in the January 17\r\ntransaction.  That finding must be supported by a preponderance of\r\nthe evidence, see United States v. Clark, 84 F.3d 506, 509 (1st\r\nCir. 1996), and we review it only for clear error, see United\r\nStates v. McKeeve, 131 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 1997); Batista-Polanco,\r\n927 F.2d at 22.\r\nThe district court's finding that Valladares perjured\r\nhimself has ample support.  Valladares testified unequivocally and\r\nunder oath that he had no involvement in the January 17 transaction\r\nand was misidentified as having taken part in it.  However,\r\nValladares's presence at the delivery was photographed.  He was\r\nobserved on that day by three federal officers and a co-defendant,\r\nall of whom gave sworn testimony as to his presence and involvement\r\nin the transaction.  In these circumstances, a finding of perjury\r\nwas not clear error.\r\nValladares argues that the district court improperly\r\nbased its enhancement for perjury on only the jury verdict and\r\nfailed to make the findings suggested by the Supreme Court in\r\nUnited States v. Dunnigan, 507 U.S. 87 (1993).  In Dunnigan, the\r\nCourt stated that, when a court imposes a sentence enhancement for\r\nperjury, \"it is preferable for a district court to address each\r\nelement of the alleged perjury in a separate and clear finding.\" \r\nSee id. at 95.  Specific findings, the Court explained, protect\r\nagainst sentence enhancement based merely on the fact that a\r\ndefendant's testimony was inconsistent with a guilty verdict. \r\nSee id. (observing that not all testimony at odds with the verdict\r\nwas necessarily false).\r\nWe do not agree that the court abdicated its duty to make\r\nan independent inquiry into Valladares's testimony.  It referred to\r\nthe federal perjury statute and made an express finding of perjury. \r\nThe court identified the testimony upon which it was basing the\r\nenhancement and referred explicitly to Dunnigan, noting that\r\nValladares had a \"[c]onstitutional right to testify on his own\r\nbehalf but not to provide intentional falsehoods.\"\r\nIt is not fatal that the court did not make express\r\nfindings as to each of the elements of perjury.  The Dunnigan Court\r\nexplained that a \"determination that enhancement is required is\r\nsufficient . . . [provided] the court makes a finding of an\r\nobstruction of, or impediment to, justice that encompasses all of\r\nthe factual predicates for a finding of perjury.\"  Dunnigan, 507\r\nU.S. at 95.  We have added that \"[a] sentencing court . . . is not\r\nrequired to address each element of perjury in a separate and clear\r\nfinding.\"  United States v. Matiz, 14 F.3d 79, 84 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\nThe court's discussion of the two-level enhancement and finding of\r\nperjury was, in all the circumstances, sufficient.\r\nValladares criticizes one particular statement that the\r\ncourt made: \"the jury returned a guilty verdict against the\r\ndefendant which clearly establishes that his testimony was not\r\nconsidered truthful nor was it the result of confusion, mistake or\r\nfaulty memory.\"  To hold that a guilty verdict, without more,\r\nimplies that a defendant's exculpatory testimony was false could be\r\ntroubling in some cases.  See Dunnigan, 507 U.S. at 95 (noting that\r\na defendant's \"testimony may be truthful, but the jury may\r\nnonetheless find the testimony insufficient to excuse criminal\r\nliability or prove lack of intent\").  In a case like this, however,\r\nwhere the defendant categorically denied being present during the\r\ncriminal transaction, the verdict provides a valid yardstick by\r\nwhich to measure the truth of the defendant's testimony.  If the\r\njury believed Valladares was not present on January 17, it would\r\nhave had to acquit.  Valladares's conviction, if it implies\r\nanything at all, shows that the jury thought Valladares\r\nparticipated in the January 17 transaction.  Since his presence \r\ndirectly contradicts his sworn testimony, the court's remark was\r\nnot improper in the circumstances of this case.  We conclude that\r\nthe district court's findings were sufficient to support its two-\r\nlevel enhancement pursuant to  3C1.1.\r\nD.   Three-Level Enhancement for Knowledge of Criminal\r\nActivity.\r\nFor the first time, Valladares also challenges on appeal\r\nthe district court's three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \r\n2S1.1(b)(1), which increases an offense level if the defendant\r\n\"knew or believed that the [laundered] funds were the proceeds of\r\nan unlawful activity involving the manufacture, importation, or\r\ndistribution of narcotics or other controlled substances.\" \r\nU.S.S.G.  2S1.1(b)(1).\r\nValladares did not object in the district court to the\r\nthree-level enhancement.  He challenged \"the inclusion in the\r\nPresentence Report of the offense conduct set forth from Pages 3 to\r\nParagraph 2 at 7,\" which included background information on the\r\ndrug syndicate and the government's investigation, but he did not\r\nobject either to the three level enhancement or to the facts\r\nsupporting that enhancement on pages ten and eleven of the PSR.  In\r\nfact, Valladares's attorney told the sentencing court that his\r\nobjection was designed to allow \"only so much [information about\r\nthe drug-related activity as] . . . would be necessary to sustain\r\nany finding that the three level increase.\"  Further, the offense\r\nlevel that Valladares recommended in his statement of objections to\r\nsentencing included the three-level enhancement.\r\nA defendant who fails to raise an objection in the\r\nsentencing court waives his ability to do so on appeal, except in\r\nextraordinary circumstances.  See United States v. Benjamin, 30\r\nF.3d 196, 197 (1st Cir. 1994) (stating that a sentencing challenge\r\nshould not \"be addressed for the first time on appeal\").  Thus, we\r\nmay reverse Valladares's enhancement under U.S.S.G.  2S1.1(b)(1)\r\nonly if it constituted \"plain error.\"  See id.  In order to meet\r\nthat standard, Valladares must prove: (i) a reviewable error\r\noccurred during sentencing; (ii) the error was clear or obvious;\r\nand (iii) the error affected his \"'substantial rights,' which in\r\nmost cases means that the defendant must make a specific showing\r\nthat the error probably affected his sentence.\"  United States v.\r\nOlivier-Diaz, 13 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nValladares sketches several brief arguments, but falls\r\nfar short of the mark.  First, he points out a minor inconsistency\r\nin the government's case: the government's closing referred to a\r\ntelephone call between Agent Suarez and Valladares on January 17,\r\nbut Agent Suarez testified that he did not talk to anyone other\r\nthan Escobar on that date.  As neither the PSR nor the sentencing\r\ncourt relied on this bit of testimony, we cannot discern its import\r\nand Valladares does not elaborate.\r\nSecond, Valladares repeats his earlier argument that the\r\nevidence was not sufficient to support a finding that he knew or\r\nbelieved the money that he laundered was the fruit of criminal\r\nlabor.  We have already rejected this argument in the context of\r\nsufficiency of the evidence, but note in addition that the PSR\r\nalone pointed to sufficient evidence to support this enhancement. \r\nThe PSR made reference to Escobar's testimony that Valladares had\r\nassisted him \"countless times in the delivery of multi-thousands of\r\ndollars for payment of the drug load in Miami, Florida.\"  In\r\naddition, the PSR noted that approximately 100 kilograms of cocaine\r\nwere stored at Valladares's home just prior to the January 17\r\ntransaction.  Valladares cannot challenge these facts before us\r\nbecause he failed to do so below.  See Benjamin, 30 F.3d at 197\r\n(\"[A] defendant may not challenge the findings in his PSR if he has\r\nfailed to object to that report in the district court.\").  These\r\nfindings alone provide solid support for the court's three-level\r\nenhancement.\r\nFinally, Valladares suggests that the court's enhancement\r\nis inconsistent with his acquittal on the only drug-related count\r\nof the indictment against him.  As noted above, we will not\r\nscrutinize an acquittal in an attempt to discern its meaning.  Seesupra.  In addition, the standard of proof at sentencing  \r\npreponderance of the evidence   is substantially lower than the\r\n\"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard used at trial.  We have said\r\nin the past, and reaffirm today, that a court may rely on acquitted\r\nconduct at the sentencing phase if the conduct meets the lower\r\nstandard of proof used at sentencing.  See United States v. Ovalle-\r\nMarquez, 36 F.3d 212, 223 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that an acquittal\r\n\"does not mean, however, that the court could not consider that\r\nconduct as 'relevant conduct' [for sentencing purposes]\"); United\r\nStates v. Carrozza, 4 F.3d 70, 80 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Relevant\r\nconduct increases a defendant's sentence, sometimes very\r\nsignificantly, despite the fact that it was not charged in an\r\nindictment and even despite the fact that a jury may have acquitted\r\nthe defendant for that precise conduct.\" (citation omitted)). \r\nAfter having reviewed the evidence, we are convinced that\r\nValladares's knowledge of Escobar's drug business was sufficiently\r\nestablished to support a sentence enhancement.  Thus, we conclude\r\nthat the enhancement for criminal knowledge under  2S1.1(b)(1) was\r\nnot plain error.\r\nE.   Amount and Calculation of the Fine.\r\nAlthough Valladares purports to challenge the amount of\r\nhis fine, his brief is devoid of argument.  It is well settled that\r\n\"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some\r\neffort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"  Zannino,\r\n895 F.2d at 16.  Accordingly, Valladares has waived contest of his\r\nfine.\r\nAffirmed.\r\n",

Gonzalez-Maldonado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197384\"><a href=\"/opinion/197384/united-states-v-gonzalez-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 12 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  The jury could have found the following.\r\nAs part of a federal undercover operation, FBI Special\r\nAgent Martin Suarez infiltrated a money-laundering organization in\r\nPuerto Rico.  That organization received large quantities of United\r\nStates currency generated by cocaine distribution, exchanged the\r\ncurrency for monetary instruments in small denominations, and\r\narranged for transportation of those instruments to Columbia.\r\nBeginning in late 1993, Agent Suarez laundered money for\r\nan organization code-named \"Roberto Diez.\"  Several deliveries of\r\ndrug money from Roberto Diez were made to Agent Suarez.  One such\r\ndelivery was made by Reynaldo Escobar-Mosquera (\"Escobar\"), who was\r\nindicted but testified for the government at Valladares's trial.\r\nThe transaction that involved Valladares took place on\r\nJanuary 17, 1994.  On that date, someone from Roberto Diez paged\r\nAgent Suarez.  Agent Suarez responded by calling a cellular phone\r\nrented to Valladares.  Agent Suarez and Valladares set up a meeting\r\nat which Roberto Diez was to deliver money to Agent Suarez.  Agent\r\nSuarez proceeded to the agreed meeting place, where he saw Escobar\r\nand a then-unidentified man sitting in a black Jeep Cherokee. \r\nAfter Agent Suarez and Escobar exchanged greetings from their\r\nvehicles, the second man got out of the Cherokee carrying a box. \r\nThe second man placed the box, which contained roughly $190,000, on\r\nthe rear passenger seat of Agent Suarez's car.  At that time, Agent\r\nSuarez looked directly at the second man from a distance of\r\napproximately three or four feet.  The second man then got back\r\ninto the Cherokee and drove off with Escobar.  Several weeks later,\r\nwhen Agent Suarez reviewed the driver's license photographs of\r\npersons associated with Escobar's company, \"Hacienda Remini,\" he\r\nidentified Valladares as having been the second man at the January\r\n17 encounter.\r\nThe January 17 delivery was observed by at least two\r\nother witnesses, agents on an FBI surveillance team: Special Agent\r\nAdalberto Rivera and Special Agent Luis Fraticelli.  Agent Rivera\r\nwas parked near the black Jeep Cherokee.  He photographed the\r\ntransaction with a zoom lens from a distance of 100 to 150 feet,\r\nand these photographs were introduced into evidence.  Valladares\r\nappeared in two of the photographs.  At one point, Escobar and\r\nValladares came within fifty feet of Agent Rivera.  Agent\r\nFraticelli observed Valladares not only at the transaction but\r\nafterwards when he followed the black Jeep Cherokee.  Both agents\r\npicked out Valladares's driver's license photo from among several\r\nothers.\r\nValladares and three co-defendants were named in a second\r\nsuperseding indictment returned on September 27, 1995.  Valladares\r\nwas charged with two counts: conspiracy to distribute cocaine and\r\nmoney laundering.  At trial, the government presented the testimony\r\nof Escobar as well as of Agents Suarez, Rivera and Fraticelli.  All\r\nfour witnesses testified that Valladares had participated in the\r\nJanuary 17 delivery.  Further, Escobar testified that he,\r\nValladares, and a man named Miguel Torres, distributed cocaine in\r\nPuerto Rico.  He stated that the three men started a corporation\r\ncalled \"Hacienda Remini,\" a name derived from the first name of\r\neach founder, to launder the money produced by their drug\r\ndistribution.  According to Escobar, Valladares knew the details of\r\nand participated fully in the drug and money-laundering operation.\r\nValladares's defense was that he was unaware of Escobar's\r\ncriminal activities and that the federal agents were mistaken when\r\nthey identified him as a participant at the January 17 delivery. \r\nValladares, and two defense witnesses, testified that Valladares\r\nengaged in only legitimate business and that, to the best of their\r\nknowledge, Escobar had accrued his wealth by gambling.  To show\r\nthat he had been misidentified, Valladares was prepared to testify\r\nthat a United States Customs Service investigation report (the\r\n\"USCS Report\") had incorrectly identified Valladares as the\r\nindividual who delivered $950,000 in currency during a November 25,\r\n1993 money transfer.  Valladares contended that, since the Customs\r\nService used the same identification methodology as did the FBI,\r\nits earlier mistaken identification of him cast doubt on his\r\npresent identification.  In his opening statement, Valladares's\r\nattorney promised the jury that he would present evidence regarding\r\nthe earlier misidentification.  The court, however, excluded the\r\nUSCS Report as lacking in relevance, reasoning that the federal\r\nagents had identified Valladares based on their first-hand\r\nobservations of him during the January 17 transaction.\r\nValladares was convicted of money laundering and\r\nacquitted of the drug conspiracy charge.  The Pre-Sentence Report\r\n(\"PSR\") recommended a base offense level of twenty.  On top of that\r\nbase, the PSR recommended several enhancements.  The first was a\r\nthree-level increase because Valladares knew that the laundered\r\nfunds arose from unlawful activity.  See U.S.S.G.  2S1.1(b)(1). \r\nSecond, the PSR recommended a two-level increase for obstruction of\r\njustice because, it concluded, Valladares had committed perjury by\r\ndenying at trial any involvement in the criminal enterprise.  SeeU.S.S.G.  3C1.1.  Lastly, the PSR included a one-level increase\r\nbecause Valladares laundered more than $100,000 but less than\r\n$200,000.  See U.S.S.G.  2S1.1(b)(2).  The PSR, therefore,\r\nrecommended a total offense level of twenty-six.  In addition, the\r\nPSR indicated a fine range running from a minimum of $12,500 to a\r\nmaximum of $500,000.  See U.S.S.G.  5E1.2(c)(3), 5E1.2(c)(4).\r\nValladares objected in the district court to the two-\r\nlevel adjustment for obstruction of justice and to the inclusion of\r\nacquitted conduct in the PSR.  He did not, however, object to the\r\nthree-level increase based on his knowledge of the criminal nature\r\nof the laundered funds.   Valladares sought an offense level of\r\ntwenty-four, two levels lower than the PSR's recommendation.  The\r\ndistrict court overruled Valladares's objections, sentenced him to\r\nseventy-eight months in prison, and fined him $12,500.  Valladares\r\nappealed.\r\n\n                          II.\r\nA.  Exclusion of the USCS Report.\r\nValladares argues on appeal that the court's exclusion of\r\nthe USCS Report was an abuse of discretion that prevented him from\r\npresenting the \"core\" of his defense to the jury and violated his\r\nSixth Amendment rights.  We review a court's exclusion of evidence\r\nfor abuse of discretion.  See United States v. Brandon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"664045\"><a href=\"/opinion/664045/united-states-v-peter-brandon-united-states-of-america-v-charles-d/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444 (1st Cir. 1994).  Even if a lower court abuses its\r\ndiscretion, we will affirm unless the error affected the\r\ndefendant's substantial rights.  See Fed. R. Evid. 103(a).  In a\r\ndirect criminal appeal implicating constitutional rights, we will\r\naffirm if the government shows there was no reasonable possibility\r\nthat the excluded evidence would have affected the jury verdict,\r\ni.e. that any error was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \r\nUnited States v. Mulinelli-Navas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739903\"><a href=\"/opinion/739903/united-states-v-mara-mulinelli-navas/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 992 (1st Cir. 1997)\r\n(quoting  Chapman v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (1967)) (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\nValladares contends that the USCS Report would reveal\r\nthat he was mis-described as a participant in a November 25 money-\r\nlaundering transaction in Puerto Rico.  Actually, Valladares says\r\nhe was in Miami at the time.  The district court excluded the\r\nreport because of its lack of relevance, stating that Valladares\r\nhad to establish that the agents \"were mistaken because\r\n[Valladares] wasn't there [on January 17,] not because two months\r\nprior other agents made a mistake[] as to his identity.\"  Cf. 2\r\nJoseph M. McLaughlin, Weinstein's Federal Evidence \r\n401.04[2][e][ii], at 401-29 (2d ed. 1997) (\"Evidence, though\r\notherwise relevant, may be excluded because it is too remote in\r\nspace or time from the proposition being proved.\").  When ruling on\r\nremote evidence, the judge must \"weigh its probative value against\r\nthe dangers of unfairness, confusion, and undue expenditure of time\r\non collateral issues.\"  Id.\r\nFor a variety of reasons, we see no abuse of discretion\r\nin the exclusion of the USCS Report.  First, even if it had\r\nrevealed an earlier mistaken identification, we doubt its\r\nrelevance.  Cf. Jordan v. Ducharme, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597889\"><a href=\"/opinion/597889/leland-a-jordan-v-kenneth-ducharme/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">933</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 938 (9th Cir.\r\n1993) (holding that a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were not\r\nviolated by the exclusion of evidence \"that some person, not the\r\nwitnesses in court, had mistakenly identified [the defendant] as\r\nthe robber in other crimes for which he was not being tried\").\r\nMoreover, even supposing arguendo that a\r\nmisidentification made two months earlier has probative value to\r\ndisprove a subsequent identification made by a different agent in\r\na different governmental agency, the USCS Report does not show that\r\nagents mistakenly placed Valladares at the scene on November 25. \r\nThe USCS Report makes reference to the fact that the pagers used to\r\nfacilitate the November deal were rented to Valladares: this did\r\nnot necessarily indicate that Valladares was physically present at\r\nthe November 25 exchange in Puerto Rico.  The participants were\r\ndescribed only as \"two white hispanic males, approximately 45 to 50\r\nyears old.\"  Hence, the USCS Report failed to support even the\r\nquestionable point asserted by the defense.\r\nValladares contends that the USCS Report had relevance\r\nbecause the government was planning to produce its author to\r\ntestify that Valladares participated in the November 25, 1993\r\nincident.  There is simply no record support for this assertion. \r\nThe government denies any such intention and, in any case, no such\r\nwitness was called.\r\nThe USCS Report, in brief, fails even the most basic test\r\nof logical relevance: it does not make a later misidentification\r\nany more or less likely than it would be otherwise.  See Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 401 (noting that the minimum requirement for admissibility is\r\nthat a piece of evidence have a \"tendency to make the existence of\r\nany fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action\r\nmore probable or less probable than it would be without the\r\nevidence\").  Lacking relevance, the report was not admissible,\r\nsee Fed. R. Evid. 402 (\"Evidence which is not relevant is not\r\nadmissible.\").\r\nObviously, the exclusion of immaterial evidence did not\r\nviolate Valladares's constitutional rights.  See Taylor, 484 U.S.\r\nat 410 (\"The accused does not have an unfettered right to offer\r\ntestimony that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise\r\ninadmissible under standard rules of evidence.\"); United States v.\r\nRodriguez Cortes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572412\"><a href=\"/opinion/572412/united-states-v-fabio-rodriguez-cortes-united-states-v-eduardo/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 546 (1st Cir. 1991) (finding\r\nharmless error).\r\nB.   Sufficiency of the Evidence.\r\nValladares next argues that the evidence against him was\r\ninsufficient, as a matter of law, to support his conviction for\r\nmoney laundering.  When a defendant brings a sufficiency challenge,\r\n\"our task is to determine whether any rational jury, taking the\r\nevidence in its totality and in the light most flattering to the\r\ngovernment, could have found appellant guilty beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt.\"  United States v. Zannino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 1990). \r\nIn making this inquiry, we resolve all credibility questions in\r\nfavor of the verdict.  See United States v. Batista-Polanco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556636\"><a href=\"/opinion/556636/united-states-v-johnny-rafael-batista-polanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">927</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nTo prove the money-laundering charge, the government had\r\nto show beyond a reasonable doubt that Valladares, \r\nknowing that the property involved in a\r\nfinancial transaction represents the proceeds\r\nof some form of unlawful activity, conduct[ed]\r\nor attempt[ed] to conduct such a financial\r\ntransaction which in fact involv[ed] the\r\nproceeds of specified illegal activity  \r\n\n(B)  knowing that the transaction [was]\r\n     designed in whole or in part  \r\n\n     (i)  to conceal or disguise the nature,\r\n          the location, the source, the\r\n          ownership, or the control of the\r\n          proceeds of specified unlawful\r\n          activity; . . . .\r\n18 U.S.C.  1956(a)(1); see also Gonzalez-Maldonado, 115 F.3d at\r\n20-21.  The term \"financial transaction,\" as used in  1956(a)(1),\r\nincludes only dealings that affect \"interstate or foreign\r\ncommerce,\" or that involve \"the use of a financial institution\r\nwhich is engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate\r\nor foreign commerce in any way or degree.\"  18 U.S.C.  1956(c)(4).\r\nThe record does not bear out Valladares's contention that\r\nthe government failed to show that the January 17 transaction\r\nimplicated interstate or foreign commerce.  Both Agent Suarez and\r\nanother FBI Agent named Siverio testified that the money they\r\n\"laundered\" was sent to Columbia.  Agent Suarez stated under oath\r\nthat he had sent approximately twenty million dollars out of the\r\ncountry over the years of his undercover investigation.  The\r\nJanuary 17 transaction was merely one more delivery in the series\r\nof FBI deals.  In light of the fact that  1956(a)(1) requires that\r\na transaction have only a de minimis effect on interstate commerce,\r\nsee United States v. Peay, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"588181\"><a href=\"/opinion/588181/united-states-v-benjamin-shabazz-peay-united-states-of-america-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74 (4th Cir. 1992), a\r\nreasonable jury could have concluded that the government met its\r\nburden of showing the requisite nexus to interstate commerce.\r\nValladares also argues that his acquittal on the\r\nconspiracy count implies that the government did not prove beyond\r\na reasonable doubt that he knew of the illicit nature of the\r\nlaundered funds or even that the money represented proceeds from a\r\nspecified unlawful activity.  When reviewing the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence, the only question before this court is whether the\r\nevidence at trial could have supported the conviction made.  SeeZannino, 895 F.2d at 9.  Acquittal on one count of a multi-count\r\nindictment is not a factor in this inquiry; sufficiency-of-the-\r\nevidence review \"should be independent of the jury's determination\r\nthat evidence on another count was sufficient.\"  United States v.\r\nPowell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111286\"><a href=\"/opinion/111286/united-states-v-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67 (1984).  We do not give weight to an\r\nacquittal even where verdicts are logically inconsistent because\r\nsuch verdicts might reflect only that the jury acquitted \"through\r\nmistake, compromise, or lenity.\"  Id.\r\nAs part of its case, the government presented four\r\nwitnesses who testified regarding Valladares's participation in the\r\nJanuary 17 transaction.  The witnesses placed that transaction in\r\nthe context of many similar dealings, all of which had the goal of\r\nfunneling to Columbia money illicitly obtained from cocaine\r\ndistribution.  When Valladares dropped the money into Agent\r\nSuarez's car, he said, \"This is for Flaco,\" a Columbian supplier of\r\ncocaine.  Further, Escobar stated under oath that he and Valladares\r\nwere partners who, for several years, obtained drugs from Columbia,\r\ndistributed those drugs, and collected money for them.  On several\r\noccasions, Escobar and Valladares stored drugs at their home. \r\nEscobar testified as to Valladares's many telephone calls\r\ndiscussing drug and money-laundering transactions and the\r\ngovernment played tapes of those calls at trial.  The record amply\r\nprovides a basis for a jury to conclude that the proceeds were the\r\nfruit of drug-related activity and that Valladares knew that fact.\r\nValladares further contends the government failed to show\r\nthat he knew the transactions were designed to conceal or disguise\r\nthe nature of the money with the aim of converting the fruits of\r\ncriminal enterprise into less detectable forms.  But the government\r\nmet its burden here as well.  A reasonable jury could conclude,\r\nfrom the evidence presented, that Valladares knew of the necessity\r\nfor secrecy.  Escobar testified that he and Valladares kept their\r\ndrug money hidden in the trunk of their car during the day and\r\nslept with it at night.  They did not deposit it in the bank,\r\nEscobar testified, for fear of immediate arrest.  In addition,\r\nValladares took elaborate precautions to make sure that the January\r\n17 transaction was not discovered.  In his telephone call on that\r\nday and calls on other days, he used code words designed to confuse\r\nanyone who might be listening in.  These actions support a finding\r\nthat Valladares intended to conceal the source of the $190,000 that\r\nhe delivered to Agent Suarez.\r\nIn sum, the record contains sufficient evidence to\r\nsupport the jury's guilty verdict.\r\nC.   Two-level Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice.\r\nValladares assails the court's imposition of a two-level\r\nsentence enhancement for obstruction of justice.  See U.S.S.G. \r\n3C1.1.  (increasing by two the offense level of a defendant who\r\n\"willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or\r\nimpede, the administration of justice during the investigation,\r\nprosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense.\").  Perjury may\r\nbe such an obstruction of justice.  See  U.S.S.G.  3C1.1 comment\r\n(n.3(b)) (stating that the enhancement is triggered by \"committing,\r\nsuborning, or attempting to suborn perjury\"); United States v.\r\nDunnigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 98 (1993) (\"Upon a proper determination that\r\nthe accused has committed perjury at trial, an enhancement of\r\nsentence is required by the Sentencing Guidelines [ 3C1.1].\"). \r\nThe court found that Valladares perjured himself by denying at\r\ntrial under oath his presence and participation in the January 17\r\ntransaction.  That finding must be supported by a preponderance of\r\nthe evidence, see United States v. Clark, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196789\"><a href=\"/opinion/196789/united-states-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">506</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 509 (1st\r\nCir. 1996), and we review it only for clear error, see United\r\nStates v. McKeeve, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197677\"><a href=\"/opinion/197677/united-states-v-mckeeve/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15 (1st Cir. 1997); Batista-Polanco,\r\n927 F.2d at 22.\r\nThe district court's finding that Valladares perjured\r\nhimself has ample support.  Valladares testified unequivocally and\r\nunder oath that he had no involvement in the January 17 transaction\r\nand was misidentified as having taken part in it.  However,\r\nValladares's presence at the delivery was photographed.  He was\r\nobserved on that day by three federal officers and a co-defendant,\r\nall of whom gave sworn testimony as to his presence and involvement\r\nin the transaction.  In these circumstances, a finding of perjury\r\nwas not clear error.\r\nValladares argues that the district court improperly\r\nbased its enhancement for perjury on only the jury verdict and\r\nfailed to make the findings suggested by the Supreme Court in\r\nUnited States v. Dunnigan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112821\"><a href=\"/opinion/112821/united-states-v-dunnigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).  In Dunnigan, the\r\nCourt stated that, when a court imposes a sentence enhancement for\r\nperjury, \"it is preferable for a district court to address each\r\nelement of the alleged perjury in a separate and clear finding.\" \r\nSee id. at 95.  Specific findings, the Court explained, protect\r\nagainst sentence enhancement based merely on the fact that a\r\ndefendant's testimony was inconsistent with a guilty verdict. \r\nSee id. (observing that not all testimony at odds with the verdict\r\nwas necessarily false).\r\nWe do not agree that the court abdicated its duty to make\r\nan independent inquiry into Valladares's testimony.  It referred to\r\nthe federal perjury statute and made an express finding of perjury. \r\nThe court identified the testimony upon which it was basing the\r\nenhancement and referred explicitly to Dunnigan, noting that\r\nValladares had a \"[c]onstitutional right to testify on his own\r\nbehalf but not to provide intentional falsehoods.\"\r\nIt is not fatal that the court did not make express\r\nfindings as to each of the elements of perjury.  The Dunnigan Court\r\nexplained that a \"determination that enhancement is required is\r\nsufficient . . . [provided] the court makes a finding of an\r\nobstruction of, or impediment to, justice that encompasses all of\r\nthe factual predicates for a finding of perjury.\"  Dunnigan, 507\r\nU.S. at 95.  We have added that \"[a] sentencing court . . . is not\r\nrequired to address each element of perjury in a separate and clear\r\nfinding.\"  United States v. Matiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195125\"><a href=\"/opinion/195125/united-states-v-esperanza-matiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 (1st Cir. 1994). \r\nThe court's discussion of the two-level enhancement and finding of\r\nperjury was, in all the circumstances, sufficient.\r\nValladares criticizes one particular statement that the\r\ncourt made: \"the jury returned a guilty verdict against the\r\ndefendant which clearly establishes that his testimony was not\r\nconsidered truthful nor was it the result of confusion, mistake or\r\nfaulty memory.\"  To hold that a guilty verdict, without more,\r\nimplies that a defendant's exculpatory testimony was false could be\r\ntroubling in some cases.  See Dunnigan, 507 U.S. at 95 (noting that\r\na defendant's \"testimony may be truthful, but the jury may\r\nnonetheless find the testimony insufficient to excuse criminal\r\nliability or prove lack of intent\").  In a case like this, however,\r\nwhere the defendant categorically denied being present during the\r\ncriminal transaction, the verdict provides a valid yardstick by\r\nwhich to measure the truth of the defendant's testimony.  If the\r\njury believed Valladares was not present on January 17, it would\r\nhave had to acquit.  Valladares's conviction, if it implies\r\nanything at all, shows that the jury thought Valladares\r\nparticipated in the January 17 transaction.  Since his presence \r\ndirectly contradicts his sworn testimony, the court's remark was\r\nnot improper in the circumstances of this case.  We conclude that\r\nthe district court's findings were sufficient to support its two-\r\nlevel enhancement pursuant to  3C1.1.\r\nD.   Three-Level Enhancement for Knowledge of Criminal\r\nActivity.\r\nFor the first time, Valladares also challenges on appeal\r\nthe district court's three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \r\n2S1.1(b)(1), which increases an offense level if the defendant\r\n\"knew or believed that the [laundered] funds were the proceeds of\r\nan unlawful activity involving the manufacture, importation, or\r\ndistribution of narcotics or other controlled substances.\" \r\nU.S.S.G.  2S1.1(b)(1).\r\nValladares did not object in the district court to the\r\nthree-level enhancement.  He challenged \"the inclusion in the\r\nPresentence Report of the offense conduct set forth from Pages 3 to\r\nParagraph 2 at 7,\" which included background information on the\r\ndrug syndicate and the government's investigation, but he did not\r\nobject either to the three level enhancement or to the facts\r\nsupporting that enhancement on pages ten and eleven of the PSR.  In\r\nfact, Valladares's attorney told the sentencing court that his\r\nobjection was designed to allow \"only so much [information about\r\nthe drug-related activity as] . . . would be necessary to sustain\r\nany finding that the three level increase.\"  Further, the offense\r\nlevel that Valladares recommended in his statement of objections to\r\nsentencing included the three-level enhancement.\r\nA defendant who fails to raise an objection in the\r\nsentencing court waives his ability to do so on appeal, except in\r\nextraordinary circumstances.  See United States v. Benjamin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195479\"><a href=\"/opinion/195479/united-states-v-benjamin/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197 (1st Cir. 1994) (stating that a sentencing challenge\r\nshould not \"be addressed for the first time on appeal\").  Thus, we\r\nmay reverse Valladares's enhancement under U.S.S.G.  2S1.1(b)(1)\r\nonly if it constituted \"plain error.\"  See id.  In order to meet\r\nthat standard, Valladares must prove: (i) a reviewable error\r\noccurred during sentencing; (ii) the error was clear or obvious;\r\nand (iii) the error affected his \"'substantial rights,' which in\r\nmost cases means that the defendant must make a specific showing\r\nthat the error probably affected his sentence.\"  United States v.\r\nOlivier-Diaz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195103\"><a href=\"/opinion/195103/united-states-v-olivier/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1st Cir. 1993).\r\nValladares sketches several brief arguments, but falls\r\nfar short of the mark.  First, he points out a minor inconsistency\r\nin the government's case: the government's closing referred to a\r\ntelephone call between Agent Suarez and Valladares on January 17,\r\nbut Agent Suarez testified that he did not talk to anyone other\r\nthan Escobar on that date.  As neither the PSR nor the sentencing\r\ncourt relied on this bit of testimony, we cannot discern its import\r\nand Valladares does not elaborate.\r\nSecond, Valladares repeats his earlier argument that the\r\nevidence was not sufficient to support a finding that he knew or\r\nbelieved the money that he laundered was the fruit of criminal\r\nlabor.  We have already rejected this argument in the context of\r\nsufficiency of the evidence, but note in addition that the PSR\r\nalone pointed to sufficient evidence to support this enhancement. \r\nThe PSR made reference to Escobar's testimony that Valladares had\r\nassisted him \"countless times in the delivery of multi-thousands of\r\ndollars for payment of the drug load in Miami, Florida.\"  In\r\naddition, the PSR noted that approximately 100 kilograms of cocaine\r\nwere stored at Valladares's home just prior to the January 17\r\ntransaction.  Valladares cannot challenge these facts before us\r\nbecause he failed to do so below.  See Benjamin, 30 F.3d at 197\r\n(\"[A] defendant may not challenge the findings in his PSR if he has\r\nfailed to object to that report in the district court.\").  These\r\nfindings alone provide solid support for the court's three-level\r\nenhancement.\r\nFinally, Valladares suggests that the court's enhancement\r\nis inconsistent with his acquittal on the only drug-related count\r\nof the indictment against him.  As noted above, we will not\r\nscrutinize an acquittal in an attempt to discern its meaning.  Seesupra.  In addition, the standard of proof at sentencing  \r\npreponderance of the evidence   is substantially lower than the\r\n\"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard used at trial.  We have said\r\nin the past, and reaffirm today, that a court may rely on acquitted\r\nconduct at the sentencing phase if the conduct meets the lower\r\nstandard of proof used at sentencing.  See United States v. Ovalle-\r\nMarquez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195633\"><a href=\"/opinion/195633/united-states-v-ovalle-marquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223 (1st Cir. 1994) (noting that an acquittal\r\n\"does not mean, however, that the court could not consider that\r\nconduct as 'relevant conduct' [for sentencing purposes]\"); United\r\nStates v. Carrozza, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629118\"><a href=\"/opinion/629118/united-states-v-robert-f-carrozza-united-states-of-america-v-raymond-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">70</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"Relevant\r\nconduct increases a defendant's sentence, sometimes very\r\nsignificantly, despite the fact that it was not charged in an\r\nindictment and even despite the fact that a jury may have acquitted\r\nthe defendant for that precise conduct.\" (citation omitted)). \r\nAfter having reviewed the evidence, we are convinced that\r\nValladares's knowledge of Escobar's drug business was sufficiently\r\nestablished to support a sentence enhancement.  Thus, we conclude\r\nthat the enhancement for criminal knowledge under  2S1.1(b)(1) was\r\nnot plain error.\r\nE.   Amount and Calculation of the Fine.\r\nAlthough Valladares purports to challenge the amount of\r\nhis fine, his brief is devoid of argument.  It is well settled that\r\n\"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some\r\neffort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"  Zannino,\r\n895 F.2d at 16.  Accordingly, Valladares has waived contest of his\r\nfine.\r\nAffirmed.\r\n</pre>",
