She was unable to  free by maneuvering, and\r\n\nended up  with the wire  at 90 degrees (downward),  her stern\r\n\nquarter   into  the  wind,   and  seas  splashing   into  the\r\n\nlazarettes, the hatch  covers having come  off, and the  crew\r\n\nunable  to replace them.   The  hydraulic winch  jammed, and,\r\n\nbecause of the  rain and weather, the crew could  not light a\r\n\ntorch to cut the wire.  Meanwhile, the seas were  filling the\r\n\nlazarettes  faster than  the bilge  pumps  could handle.   In\r\n\nresponse to  a May Day  call, another vessel arrived  and the\r\n\ncrew was  saved, but  the DRAKE was  lost.   This action  was\r\n\nbrought to recover  the agreed value, on  defendant Clarendon\r\n\nAmerican Insurance Company's hull policy.  On the basis of an\r\n\nunsatisfied condition  precedent, plaintiffs-appellants  lost\r\n\non summary judgment in the district court.  We affirm.\r\n\n          When the  DRAKE put to  sea on this voyage,  it had\r\n\nvarious  minor  deficiencies,  including  no lazarette  bilge\r\n\nalarm warning  lights and  no  required spare  communications\r\n\nbattery  in  the pilot  house.    The audible  bilge  alarms,\r\n\nhowever, were working,  and the crew  was obviously aware  of\r\n\nthe water.  The battery's  absence was also irrelevant to the\r\n\nloss.   Accordingly,  Mass.  G.L. ch.  175,   186  might have\r\n\nprecluded either of these defects, or a number of other minor\r\n\nones, from giving  rise to a successful  misrepresentation or\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nbreach of warranty  defense on the policy,1 but  this was not\r\n\nthe   set-up.    Defendant   had  a  stronger   defense,  the\r\n\nMassachusetts law of condition precedent.\r\n\n          Conformance with stated  conditions that are agreed\r\n\nto  govern  the  attachment  of  the  policy  is  obligatory,\r\n\nregardless  of their  irrelevancy to  the actual  loss.

It is enough that the  statements\r\n\nrelate essentially  to the insurer's  intelligent decision to\r\n\nissue  the policy.   See  Charles, Henry  &amp; Crowley  Co., 349\r                                                                    \r\n\nMass. at 726.  This question is an objective one:   would the\r\n\nmatter be considered  of importance by a  reasonable insurer.\r\n\nSee Krause  v. Equitable Life  Ins.

The DRAKE was  to undergo and pass an inspection\r\n\nby the  United States  Coast Guard  and display  a compliance\r\n\nsticker.   There  was  to  be a  back-up  radio battery  with\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  It  is  agreed that,  though  this was  a  marine policy,\r\nMassachusetts law governs.  See generally Wilburn Boat Co. v.\r                                                                      \r\nFireman's Fund Ins.

And, the DRAKE  was to have\r\n\nboth audible and visual bilge alarms in the lazarettes, wired\r\n\nto  the  pilot  house.     All  are  conceded  to  have  been\r\n\nunsatisfied  at the  relevant  times.    The  district  court\r\n\nfocussed on  the first, finding  that \"as  a matter of  law a\r\n\nreasonable maritime  insurer would  have wanted  to know  and\r\n\nwould  not as  a matter of  law, not fact,  have issued th[e]\r\n\npolicy  had  it  known that  there  wasn't  that  Coast Guard\r\n\nsticker.\"  We agree.  Cf. Edmonds, 642 F.2d at 883 &amp; n.2 (FAA\r                                             \r\n\nbiennial flight review requirement).\r\n\n          There  is   a  further  question   raised  by   the\r\n\nplaintiffs:  were these matters truly expressed as conditions\r\n\nprecedent.  Whether a policy term is a condition precedent or\r\n\na warranty is a question of law.  See Shaw v. Commercial Ins.\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo., 359 Mass. 601, 605-06, 270 N.E.2d 817 (1971).  Here, the\r               \r\n\nrequirement  that  the words  \"condition precedent\"  or their\r\n\nequivalent be  used was  met.  See  Charles, Henry  &amp; Crowley\r                                                                         \r\n\nCo.,  349  Mass.   at  726.     The  Fishing  Vessel   Safety\r               \r\n\nRequirements Clause, expressly attached to and forming a part\r\n\nof the policy, stated,\r\n\n          It  is  a  condition  precedent  of  this\r\n          coverage that these  requirements must be\r\n          complied  with  prior to  the  attachment\r\n          date  of this policy and as proof of such\r\n          compliance  this  Fishing  Vessel  Safety\r\n          Requirements Clause must be signed by the\r\n          Assured   and   be   returned   to   this\r\n          company . . . .\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nThe  listed \"requirements\"  included the  inspection sticker,\r\n\nthe battery, and the bilge alarms.  The captain of the DRAKE,\r\n\nwho was also the  son of its owner, signed the  clause as the\r\n\nassured, one month before the final voyage.2  \r\n\n          Plaintiffs attempt to save their case by contending\r\n\nthat  valid conditions  precedent must  appear,  initially at\r\n\nleast,  in the  application  for  insurance.    Although  the\r\n\nlanguage in  Charles, Henry  &amp; Crowley Co.  might be  read to\r                                                      \r\n\nsupport this, see 349 Mass. at 726 (\"[A] statement made in an\r                             \r\n\napplication  for a policy of insurance may become a condition\r\n\nof the policy rather than remain a warranty or representation\r\n\nif . . . .\"),  other cases reveal a broader view, see Shurdut\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.

Co., 320  Mass. 728, 731,  71\r                                               \r\n\nN.E.2d  391  (1947)  (application  for  reinstatement   after\r\n\nlapse); Lopardi,  289 Mass.  at 495  (provisions in  policy);\r                           \r\n\nKravit, 278 Mass. at 179 (policy schedule); see also Edmonds,\r                                                                        \r\n\n492 F. Supp. at  972-73 (amendments added in connection  with\r\n\nrenewal).\r\n\n          There  can be no  dispute here that  plaintiffs had\r\n\nnotice  of  the  conditions,  or that  they  related  to  the\r\n\ninsurer's decision to  take the risk.  Cf.  Edmonds, 642 F.2d\r                                                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Although  the insured's  signature  is dated  January 27,\r\n1994 rather  than 1995, it  is clear  that this was  simply a\r\nmistake.  Despite a later,  and feeble, effort to cast doubt,\r\nplaintiffs-appellants essentially admitted  as much.  In  any\r\nevent,  plaintiffs-appellants can  make  no  claim  that  the\r\nFishing Vessel Safety  Requirements Clause was not  a part of\r\nthe policy or that they had no notice.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nat 882.  Clarendon reinstated the policy on February 2, 1995,\r\n\nafter issuing notice  of cancellation, only after  plaintiffs\r\n\nhad separately  executed  and submitted  the  Fishing  Vessel\r\n\nSafety Requirements Clause  days earlier.3  The  DRAKE had no\r\n\ninspection sticker at that time, nor later that month when it\r\n\nleft  harbor.     Considering  the  facts  and  circumstances\r\n\nsurrounding  the  issuance  of  the policy,  as  we  may, see\r                                                                         \r\n\nMassachusetts  Mun. Wholesale Elec.  Co. v. Town  of Danvers,\r                                                                        \r\n\n411 Mass. 39, 45-46, 577 N.E.2d 283 (1991), we think it clear\r\n\nthat plaintiffs' argument  fails.  Cf. Shurdut, 320  Mass. at\r                                                          \r\n\n731  (resumption of  obligation  after lapse  made  expressly\r\n\nconditional   upon  the  truth  of  statements  made  in  the\r\n\napplication for reinstatement).\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  A simultaneous basis for  cancellation was non-payment of\r\nthe premium,  also remedied before  reinstatement.   Although\r\nits owners  had never before  had the Drake inspected  by the\r\nCoast Guard for  purposes of obtaining a  compliance sticker,\r\nthey requested  such an  inspection in February  1995 at  the\r\nbehest of their  insurance brokers.  The Drake  did not pass,\r\nand no sticker was issued.  The reasons are immaterial to the\r\nloss. Cf. Edmonds.\r                             \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n",

She was unable to free by maneuvering, and ended up with the wire at 90 degrees (downward), her stern quarter into the wind, and seas splashing into the lazarettes, the hatch covers having come off, and the crew unable to replace them.  The hydraulic winch jammed, and, because of the rain and weather, the crew could not light a torch to cut the wire.  Meanwhile, the seas were filling the lazarettes faster than the bilge pumps could handle.  In response to a May Day call, another vessel arrived and the crew was saved, but the DRAKE was lost.  This action was brought to recover the agreed value, on defendant Clarendon American Insurance Company's hull policy.  On the basis of an unsatisfied condition precedent, plaintiffs-appellants lost on summary judgment in the district court.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the DRAKE put to sea on this voyage, it had various minor deficiencies, including no lazarette bilge alarm warning lights and no required spare communications battery in the pilot house.  The audible bilge alarms, however, were working, and the crew was obviously aware of the water.  The battery's absence was also irrelevant to the loss.  Accordingly, Mass.G.L. ch. 175, &#167; 186 might have precluded either of these defects, or a number of other minor ones, from giving rise to a successful misrepresentation or breach of warranty defense on the policy,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> but this was not the set-up.
