Hctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Rafael F. Castro-Lang for appellant.\r\n\n   Warren Vzquez, with whom Guillermo Gil, United States\r\nAttorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Assistant United States Attorney,\r\nand Camille Vlez-Riv, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\r\nbrief for appellee.\r\n\n                       June 28, 1999\r\n\n                                BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  On April 5, 1993, Jess\r\nMiranda-Gonzlez (\"Miranda\") pleaded guilty to one count of\r\ndistributing cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.  841(a)(1).  The\r\ndistrict court sentenced Miranda to a prison term of thirty-three \r\nmonths, followed by three years of supervised release, and a $5,000\r\nfine. \r\nMiranda subsequently filed a pro se motion seeking to\r\nvacate his plea under 28 U.S.C.  2255, which was later\r\nsupplemented with a more detailed memorandum of law once he\r\nretained counsel.  In these documents, Miranda maintained, inter\r\nalia, that he did not voluntarily and intelligently plead guilty\r\nbecause he was under the influence of certain prescription drugs at\r\nthe time.  In the alternative, he argued that his answers during\r\nthe plea colloquy were so incoherent that they should have alerted\r\nthe judge to postpone the plea and order a psychiatric evaluation. \r\nThe motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who, after\r\nconducting an extensive hearing, recommended that it be denied. \r\nThe district court adopted the magistrate's findings and\r\nrecommendations in their entirety and refused to grant the motion,\r\nruling that Miranda had knowingly and intelligently entered his\r\nguilty plea.  This appeal followed.\r\nBecause entering a guilty plea is a solemn act involving\r\nthe waiver of several constitutional rights, principles of due\r\nprocess require that a plea \"amount to a voluntary and 'intentional\r\nrelinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.'\"\r\nUnited States v. Cotal-Crespo, 47 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1995)\r\n(citation omitted).  Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal\r\nProcedure sets forth a detailed procedure for accepting a guilty\r\nplea to ensure that a defendant who pleads guilty does so with \"an\r\nunderstanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of\r\nhis plea.\"  Id. (quoting McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459,\r\n467 (1969)). \r\nA defendant who pleads guilty to an offense and later\r\nattempts to wipe the slate clean bears a heavy burden, for he\r\n\"possesses no absolute right to retract his plea.\"  United States\r\nv. Pellerito, 878 F.2d 1535, 1537 (1st Cir. 1989).  A guilty plea\r\nwill not be set aside where a defendant has had a change of heart\r\nsimply because he now believes the case against him has become\r\nweaker or because he is not satisfied with the sentence he has\r\nreceived.  When, as now, a defendant wishes to have his plea\r\ndeclared invalid due to his use of prescription medication or\r\nillicit drugs, \"[t]he mere fact that [he] took potentially mood-\r\naltering medication is not sufficient to vitiate his plea.\"  Id. at\r\n1542.  Rather, he must show \"that the medication affected his\r\nrationality.\"  Id.  We review de novo the district court's legal\r\nconclusions in denying the  2255 motion, and we defer to any\r\nfindings of fact unless clearly erroneous.\r\nIn United States v. Parra-Ibanez, 936 F.2d 588 (1st Cir.\r\n1991), we imposed on district judges a duty to conduct a more\r\nsearching inquiry into the contemporaneous effects of medication on\r\na defendant's ability to render a knowing and intelligent plea when\r\nthey are alerted to the fact that a defendant has recently ingested\r\ndrugs.  Accord United States v. Cole, 813 F.2d 43, 46-47 (3d Cir.\r\n1987).  Confronted with a situation in which the district court\r\nignored obvious signs of a possible mind-altering influence, we\r\nremanded the case for further factfinding by the district court as\r\nto the chemical properties of the medication and the defendant's\r\nparticular medicinal regimen.  See 936 F.2d at 598.  Arguing that\r\nhis guilty plea is similarly suspect, Miranda seeks to shoehorn his\r\nsituation into our holding in Parra-Ibanez.  But try as he might,\r\nit does not fit.\r\nUnlike in Parra-Ibanez, once put on notice that Miranda\r\nhad been taking Xanax and Ativan, the court here conducted an\r\nextended colloquy to ascertain Miranda's reasons for taking the\r\nmedications, the frequency with which he took them, the dosage of\r\neach, and the effects of the drugs on his cognitive functions\r\nduring the change of plea hearing:\r\n  THE COURT:  Have you taken any medicine,\r\npills, drugs or alcoholic beverages in the\r\npast 24 hours?\r\n\n  THE DEFENDANT:  Yes.  I'm taking Xanax and\r\nAtivan.\r\n\n  THE COURT:  What's that for?\r\n\n  THE DEFENDANT:  For my nerves so I can relax.\r\n\n  THE COURT:  Now, when was the last time that\r\nyou have these pills?\r\n\n  THE DEFENDANT: I take them in the morning and\r\nin the evening.\r\n\n  THE COURT:  So last night you took these\r\npills?\r\n\n                     THE DEFENDANT:     Yes, this morning.\r\n\n  THE COURT:  And this morning?\r\n\n  THE DEFENDANT:  And this morning.\r\n\n  THE COURT:  Now, this Ativan and Xanax, with\r\n\"X\", Xanax, that's an anthiolithic [sic], that\r\nis, to sort of calm your nerves, isn't it?\r\n\n  THE DEFENDANT:  Yes.\r\n\n  THE COURT:  And does that in any way cloud[]\r\nyour thinking or put[] you drowsy or make[]\r\nyou drowsy or in any way impair your mental\r\nprocess?\r\n\n  THE DEFENDANT:  Sometimes I have blackouts.\r\n\n  THE COURT:  But now let me -- let's talk about\r\nnow, today, now.  You took those pills this\r\nmorning, and my question to you is whether\r\nthose pills have in any way affected your\r\ncapability or ability to understand today's\r\nproceedings.\r\n\n  THE DEFENDANT:  No.\r\n\n  THE COURT:  They don't affect you?  You have\r\nto voice your answer.\r\n\n  THE DEFENDANT:  No, no, no.\r\n\nFollowing this inquiry, the court then asked several questions of\r\nMiranda to probe his comprehension of the crime with which he was\r\ncharged and the specific purpose of that day's proceedings. \r\nMiranda briefly consulted with counsel and answered that he was\r\npresent to change his plea to guilty \"for the sale of an eighth\r\n. . . [o]f cocaine.\" \r\nWe believe that the judge faithfully conducted the\r\nrequisite Parra-Ibanez inquiry and was satisfied that in his\r\nmedicated state Miranda fully understood the nature of the hearing\r\nand the gravity of his decision to plead guilty.  The record amply\r\nsupports that determination.\r\nThe cases cited by Miranda do not compel a contrary\r\nresult.  The absolute failure to investigate further once apprised\r\nof the recent ingestion of drugs doomed the plea entered by the\r\ndefendants in Parra-Ibanez and Cole, while the judge here properly\r\nasked probing follow-up questions. \r\nManley v. United States, 396 F.2d 699 (5th Cir. 1968),\r\nsimilarly offers Miranda no solace.  In Manley, the Fifth Circuit\r\ninvalidated a defendant's plea where he was given two injections of\r\nnarcotics immediately before tendering his plea.  Because the\r\ndefendant had difficulty communicating with his own lawyer and the\r\ngovernment misrepresented the nature of the injections to the\r\ndistrict court, the court of appeals found itself unable to say\r\nwith any measure of certainty that the medication did not impair\r\nhis judgment in deciding to plead guilty.  See 396 F.2d at 701.  \r\nOurs is a different situation altogether.  The district\r\ncourt spent considerable time delving into the details surrounding\r\nthe defendant's use of the medicine during the actual plea hearing;\r\nthe magistrate judge later allowed Miranda to further develop the\r\nrecord during the habeas hearing.  Miranda does not contend that\r\neither judge misapprehended the risks of the medications or was\r\nmisinformed about their effects.  On the whole, the determination\r\nthat Miranda was of sound mind when he pleaded guilty to\r\ntrafficking in cocaine was based on reliable evidence.\r\nFinally, Miranda has a fallback position:  he insists\r\nthat his answers during the plea colloquy showed that he was so\r\nincoherent that the court should have postponed the proceedings sua\r\nsponte and ordered a psychiatric review.  We disagree.  From our\r\nreview of the transcript, Miranda's responses did not reflect a\r\npatent lack of lucidity.  To the contrary, we discern nothing that\r\nwould have warranted a departure from the scheduled proceedings. \r\nDespite having taken prescription medication that morning, Miranda\r\nsignaled that he understood the purpose of the hearing; he was able\r\nto communicate with his lawyer; and he spoke clearly and\r\nresponsively in answering the judge's inquiries.  Although he said\r\nthat he sometimes had difficulty concentrating and occasionally had\r\nwhat he called \"blackouts\" while on his medication, he acknowledged\r\nthat he was experiencing no problems during the plea hearing.  As\r\nhis own expert later attested, he was taking only mild tranquilizer\r\ntwice a day to control his bouts of anxiety.  Our conclusion is\r\nbolstered by the record of the hearing held by the magistrate judge\r\non the  2255 motion, which established, among other things, that\r\nthere existed no reason to believe that Miranda was experiencing\r\npsychosis or that he suffered from any serious mental illness at\r\nthe time of the change of plea hearing.  While we can envision a\r\nset of circumstances under which a colloquy might give rise to\r\nfurther concerns about a defendant's capacity to fully comprehend\r\nhis actions, the exhaustive on-the-record discussion here provided\r\nno warning flags warranting more drastic action.  \r\nWe note, moreover, that the district court took great\r\npains to ensure fairness, asking both the prosecutor and defense\r\ncounsel whether either had any doubts as to Miranda's competence to\r\nenter the guilty plea, in light of the disclosures concerning his\r\nmedication and recent psychiatric history.  Neither voiced an\r\nobjection.  Under the circumstances, the judge did all that was\r\nrequired of him.  \r\nFor the reasons set forth above, we affirm the district\r\ncourt's denial of Miranda's  2255 motion.\n",
