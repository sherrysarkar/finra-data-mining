The\r\n\npetitioning  unsecured creditors appealed  to the  District Court\r\n\nthe Bankruptcy Court's ruling that the unsecured creditor's claim\r\n\nshould  neither  be  denied  nor  equitably  subordinated.    The\r\n\nDistrict  Court  dismissed the  petitioning  unsecured creditor's\r\n\nappeal  for  failure to  prosecute.    The petitioning  unsecured\r\n\ncreditors now claim  that the District Court  erred in dismissing\r\n\ntheir appeal.  We affirm the Bankruptcy Court's determination.\r\n\n                          I.  BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In August  1984, Karger, the unsecured creditor, loaned\r\n\n$632,000 to  A. Pellegrino  &amp; Son,  Inc.  (\"Pellegrino\").   Melon\r\n\nProduce,  Inc.  (\"Melon  Produce\")  was  incorporated  to  secure\r\n\nKarger's  loans to Pellegrino, then in a proceeding under Chapter\r\n\n11  of the Bankruptcy Code.  Karger was Melon Produce's president\r\n\nand  sole shareholder.   The  Bankruptcy Court  approved Karger's\r\n\nloans, the  transfer of three shares of  stock in the New England\r\n\nProduce Center (\"NEPC\") and leasehold interests in three  bays at\r\n\nNEPC from Pellegrino to Melon Produce for the purpose of securing\r\n\nKarger's  loans, and Melon  Produce gave a  guaranty and security\r\n\ninterest  to Karger which included all \"instruments\" and \"all . .\r\n\n.  rights . . .  to the  payment of  money\" including  a security\r\n\ninterest  in \"all such  assets hereinafter acquired.\"   The three\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nbays and the shares  of stock were  not included in the  security\r\n\ninterests identified.   On February 27, 1987,  Melon Produce sold\r\n\nits three bays and shares of NEPC stock and paid Karger, its only\r\n\nsecured creditor, $430,022.39 from the proceeds.\r\n\n          Within a year of the payment to  Karger, an involuntary\r\n\nproceeding  against   Melon  Produce  under  Chapter   7  of  the\r\n\nBankruptcy Code was initiated  by three unsecured creditors.   On\r\n\nMarch  22, 1990,  Joseph Braunstein,  the  Chapter 7  Trustee for\r\n\nMelon Produce  (\"Trustee\"), brought  an action against  Karger in\r\n\nthe  Bankruptcy  Court.   The  complaint  alleged a  preferential\r\n\ntransfer  and a  fraudulent transfer  of property  of the  estate\r\n\nunder  the  Bankruptcy  Code  and  a  fraudulent  transfer  under\r\n\nMassachusetts state law. \r\n\n          The proceeding was transferred  to the District  Court.\r\n\nOn January  8, 1991,  the District  Court  granted the  Trustee's\r\n\nmotion for entry of final judgment  as to Count I, the preference\r\n\nclaim,  and the  Trustee's motion  for assessment  of prejudgment\r\n\ninterest.   The  District  Court entered  final  judgment on  the\r\n\nmerits,  awarding damages on Count I in the amount of $430,022.39\r\n\nplus  pre-judgment interest  in the  amount of  $29,838.39.   All\r\n\nother  counts were dismissed.   On September 29,  1992, the final\r\n\njudgment  was  upheld upon  appeal by  this Court.   In  re Melon\r                                                                           \r\n\nProduce, Inc., 976 F.2d 71 (1st Cir. 1992).\r                       \r\n\n          The  Trustee  and Karger  agreed  to  a Stipulation  of\r\n\nSettlement on  June  18, 1993.   The  Trustee had  filed a  post-\r\n\njudgment motion  to require  Karger to satisfy  the indebtedness,\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nand sought the appointment  of a Special Master for  the purposes\r\n\nof  taking  possession of  and selling  shares  of stock  held by\r\n\nKarger  in two  unrelated  corporations.   The  Trustee also  had\r\n\nbrought an action seeking to set aside as a fraudulent conveyance\r\n\nthe interest  of  Karger's wife,  Susan Karger,  in certain  real\r\n\nproperty held by her and Karger as tenants-by-the-entirety.  \r\n\n          The  stipulation stated  that Karger  had  asserted and\r\n\nrepresented  that  he  was  unable  financially  to  satisfy  the\r\n\njudgment  in full.   In  support of  this assertion,  Karger made\r\n\ncertain   financial   disclosures  to   the   Trustee,  including\r\n\nsubmitting to a deposition  by the Trustee and producing  his tax\r\n\nreturns and other work papers for review by the Trustee.   Karger\r\n\noffered  to pay  the  sum of  $400,000,  in satisfaction  of  the\r\n\njudgment and his and his  wife's obligations and indebtedness  to\r\n\nthe Trustee.   Due to  the uncertainty with  respect to  Karger's\r\n\nfinancial  situation  and the  question  of  Karger's ability  to\r\n\nsatisfy the judgment,  and given the uncertainty with  respect to\r\n\nthe valuation  of Karger's  stock in the  unrelated corporations,\r\n\nthe Trustee  agreed to  seek  the approval  of Karger's  $400,000\r\n\noffer from the Bankruptcy Court according to the following terms:\r\n\n            If  the  Settlement  Amount is  paid  [by\r\n            Karger] on or before the Settlement Date,\r\n            the  Trustee shall accept such payment in\r\n            satisfaction of Karger's obligations, and\r\n            the  Trustee shall mark  the judgment and\r\n            any  execution  therefor 'satisfied'  and\r\n            return same  to Karger.  . . .  If Karger\r\n            pays   the   Settlement  Amount   by  the\r\n            Settlement  Date,  the Trustee  shall not\r\n            object  to  the  allowance   of  Karger's\r\n            unsecured   claim   in   the  amount   of\r\n            $400,000. . . . If this settlement is not\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n            approved by the Bankruptcy Court or if an\r\n            appeal is  taken from an  order approving\r\n            this settlement and the order  is stayed,\r\n            then at the  sole option of  the Trustee,\r\n            the Trustee may  declare the  Stipulation\r\n            and    settlement    null    and    void.\r\n            Thereafter,  the  Trustee may  pursue his\r\n            rights   and  remedies   against  Karger,\r\n            including,  but  not   limited  to,   the\r\n            appointment of the Special Master to sell\r\n            the [corporate]  stock of Karger  and the\r\n            fraudulent   conveyance  action   against\r\n            Peter and Susan Karger.  \r\n\n          The petitioning unsecured creditors filed  an objection\r\n\nto the  Trustee's motion  to approve the  settlement stipulation,\r\n\nseeking the  denial of the Trustee's application  for approval of\r\n\nthe  stipulation,   or,   in  the   alternative,  the   equitable\r\n\nsubordination of  Karger's unsecured claim  to the claims  of the\r\n\nother  unsecured creditors.   On  July 22,  1993,  the Bankruptcy\r\n\nCourt  heard  the  motion  and  approved  the  settlement.    The\r\n\nunsecured  creditors argued  that  the settlement  should not  be\r\n\napproved because  the settlement provided that  the Trustee would\r\n\nnot object to Karger's unsecured claim of $400,000 and Karger was\r\n\nto pay  less than the full amount of the preference judgment. The\r\n\ntrustee  advised the  Bankruptcy Court  that he  did not  wish to\r\n\npursue   equitable  subordination  of   Karger's  $400,000  claim\r\n\nbecause, having succeeded on  the issue of preferential transfer,\r\n\nhe  did  not want  to  go  through \".  .  .  another war.\"    The\r\n\nBankruptcy Court  stated  that 11  U.S.C.    502(d)  permits  the\r\n\npetitioning unsecured creditors to object to the allowance of the\r\n\nclaim stating that \"[y]ou  could press that [claim  for equitable\r\n\nsubordination] even if the trustee rolls over and plays dead\" and\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthat they, the  objecting unsecured creditors,  \"can come in  and\r\n\nask for  equitable subordination.\"   The  context of  the court's\r\n\nstatement is  clear that  objections to Karger's  unsecured claim\r\n\ncould  be made  later \"and we'll  have a  hearing on  that.\"  The\r\n\npetitioning  unsecured creditors  did  not appeal  the Bankruptcy\r\n\nCourt's order  approving the settlement.   On September  2, 1993,\r\n\nKarger paid the $400,000 settlement to the Trustee.\r\n\n          The  petitioning  unsecured  creditors  then  filed  an\r\n\nobjection to Karger's claim in Bankruptcy Court.  On November 26,\r\n\n1993,  the petitioning  unsecured  creditors filed  a Motion  for\r\n\nSummary  Judgment  in  Bankruptcy  Court,  arguing that  Karger's\r\n\nunsecured  claim should be denied pursuant to 11 U.S.C.   502(d),\r\n\nor,  in the alternative, that  Karger's claim should be equitably\r\n\nsubordinated pursuant  to  11 U.S.C.     510(c).   The  creditors\r\n\nargued that the claim should be disallowed because Section 502(d)\r\n\nstates that \"the  court shall  disallow any claim  of any  entity\r\n\nfrom which  property is recoverable  . . . unless  such entity or\r\n\ntransferee has paid the amount, or turned over any such property,\r\n\nfor  which such entity or  transferee is liable.\"   The unsecured\r\n\ncreditors  argued  that   Karger's  unsecured  claim   should  be\r\n\ndisallowed   because  the  full amount  of  the judgment  against\r\n\nKarger was in fact not paid.  11 U.S.C.   502(d).\r\n\n          The unsecured creditors also argued that Karger's claim\r\n\nshould be  subordinated to their  unsecured claims.   This action\r\n\nwould increase the dividend to the unsecured creditors other than\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nKarger.  Section 510(c) authorizes the Bankruptcy Court to  apply\r\n\nequitable subordination principles to claims.\r\n\n          On December  28, 1993, the Bankruptcy  Court denied the\r\n\nMotion  for  Summary  Judgment  and  entered  an  order  allowing\r\n\nKarger's unsecured  claim in the amount  of $400,000.  See  In re\r                                                                           \r\n\nMelon Produce,  162 B.R. 386  (Bankr. D. Mass. 1993).   The Court\r                       \r\n\nfound that  the petitioning  unsecured creditors' Section  502(d)\r\n\nargument  failed on  the grounds  that Karger  had paid  the full\r\n\namount of  the $400,000  settlement, that the  Bankruptcy Court's\r\n\norder  approving  the  settlement  stipulation had  adjusted  the\r\n\namount of  the preference downward,  and that \"to  rule otherwise\r\n\nwould deprive the settlement  of its essential vitality.\"   As to\r\n\nthe petitioning unsecured creditors' Section 510(c) argument, the\r\n\nCourt found that \"[t]he claims are primarily  derivative from the\r\n\nsame  facts set forth in the Trustee's complaint seeking to avoid\r\n\na  fraudulent transfer.  While the Trustee did not seek equitable\r\n\nsubordination of  Karger's claim . . . he might well have done so\r\n\nbased  upon the  facts of the  matter, and res  judicata bars all\r\n\navailable  grounds for  recovery,  regardless of  whether or  not\r\n\nasserted.\"   The Bankruptcy Court  cited this court's  opinion in\r\n\nBezanson v.  Bayside Enterprises,  Inc. (In re  Medomak Canning),\r                                                                          \r\n\n922  F.2d 895 (1st Cir.  1990), and concluded  that \"the previous\r\n\nsettlement  precludes the [petitioning  unsecured creditors] from\r\n\nraising the issues of equitable subordination at this time.\"  \r\n\n          The  petitioning unsecured  creditors then  appealed to\r\n\nthe District Court from the denial of Summary Judgment.  On April\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n7,  1994,  the District  Court  affirmed  the Bankruptcy  Court's\r\n\nruling on the issues relating to the effect of the failure to pay\r\n\nthe full amount of the judgment against Karger  and  \"remanded to\r\n\nthe  Bankruptcy  Court  the  issue of  whether  [the  petitioning\r\n\nunsecured  creditors] should  be  allowed to  object to  Karger's\r\n\nclaim on equitable subordination grounds.\"\r\n\n          On  July  5,  1995,   the  Bankruptcy  Court  issued  a\r\n\nMemorandum  Decision,  in which  it  ruled  that the  petitioning\r\n\nunsecured  creditors  were  precluded   by  the  settlement  from\r\n\nobjecting to  Karger's unsecured  claim.   In  its Decision,  the\r\n\nBankruptcy  Court  resolved  the  uncertainties  created  by  its\r\n\nutterance of July 22, 1993 and its published decision of December\r\n\n28, 1993.   The Court  stated that its  initial pronouncement  on\r\n\nJuly 22, 1993, which stated  that 11 U.S.C.   502(a) permits  the\r\n\npetitioning unsecured creditors to object to the allowance of the\r\n\nclaim and that the petitioning unsecured  creditors could ask for\r\n\na hearing  on the  equitable subordination issue,  was in  error.\r\n\nWith  the  benefit  of  the motions  for  summary  judgment,  the\r\n\nBankruptcy  Court  had come  to  the opposite  conclusion  in its\r\n\npublished decision of December  28, 1993.  In that  decision, the\r\n\nBankruptcy Court  held the  petitioning unsecured creditors  were\r\n\nprecluded from raising [the equitable subordination] issue, based\r\n\nprimarily  upon this court's  opinion in  In re  Medomak Canning.\r                                                                          \r\n\nThe Bankruptcy Court now  upheld the December 28, 1993  decision,\r\n\nholding that In re  Medomak Canning was controlling and  that the\r                                             \r\n\npetitioning unsecured  creditors were not entitled  to pursue the\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nequitable  subordination issue  further.   The  court then  cited\r\n\nGrella v.  Salem Five Cent Savings Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 30 (1st Cir.\r                                                 \r\n\n1994), without discussion.\r\n\n          On  July 14, 1995,  the petitioning unsecured creditors\r\n\nagain  appealed  their  equitable  subordination  claim  to   the\r\n\nDistrict  Court.  The Bankruptcy Court gave notice to the parties\r\n\nof the appeal timetable on July 17, 1995.  On  September 5, 1995,\r\n\nthe record for the  case on appeal was assembled  and transmitted\r\n\nto the District Court.  Although the District Court did not issue\r\n\na notice to the parties of the entry of the appeal on the docket,\r\n\nthe petitioning  unsecured  creditors had  actual  knowledge  for\r\n\nseveral months of the docketing of the appeal.  Since the  filing\r\n\nof  the  appeal, the  petitioning  unsecured  creditors had  been\r\n\nmonitoring the status of the proceeding on  the Court's computer-\r\n\noperated Pacer System.\r\n\n          The petitioning  unsecured creditors  did not  file and\r\n\nserve  a brief within fifteen days  after the entry of the appeal\r\n\non  the District  Court docket,  as required  by Bankruptcy  Rule\r\n\n8009.  On February 27, 1996,  the District Court entered an order\r\n\ndismissing the  appeal for the petitioning  creditors' failure to\r\n\nprosecute the  appeal.  The petitioning  unsecured creditors then\r\n\nfiled a notice of this appeal to this Court.\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r                                   II.

While it  is true  that federal\r\n\ncourts  of appeal generally do not  rule on issues not decided in\r\n\nthe district court, we  do have discretion to address  issues not\r\n\nreached  by the district  court when the  question is essentially\r\n\nlegal and the record is complete.

Here,  the substantive underlying issues  are legal in\r\n\nnature and the record  is complete.  Furthermore, this  cause has\r\n\nalready involved  the  attention  of this  court  on  an  earlier\r\n\noccasion.   We address  the substantive underlying  issues in the\r\n\nhope  that this litigation may sooner, rather than later, come to\r\n\na conclusion.\r\n\n          A.  Disallowance of Claim\r                    A.  Disallowance of Claim\r\n\n          The petitioning unsecured creditors argue that Karger's\r\n\nclaim  should  be disallowed,  as  Karger  received a  judicially\r\n\ndetermined preferential transfer and has not paid the  amount for\r\n\nwhich he is liable because of the preferential transfer.  Section\r\n\n502(d) of the Bankruptcy Code governs the disallowance of claims.\r\n\nIt reads as follows:\r\n\n          (d)  Notwithstanding  subsections (a)  and  (b) of\r\n     this section, the court shall disallow any claim of any\r\n     entity from which property is recoverable under section\r\n     542,  543, 550,  or 553  of  this title  or  that is  a\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n     transferee   of  a  transfer  avoidable  under  section\r\n     522(f), 522(h), 544, 545,  547, 548, 549, or 724(a)  of\r\n     this title,  unless such entity or  transferee has paid\r\n     the amount, or turned over any such property, for which\r\n     such  entity  or  transferee  is liable  under  section\r\n     522(i), 542, 543, 550, or 553 of this title.  \r\n\nIn  1992, this  court held  that Karger  was the  recipient of  a\r\n\nvoidable transfer.  See In re Melon Produce, 976 F.2d at 76.\r                                                     \r\n\n          The  remaining  issue,  therefore, is  to  determine if\r\n\nKarger, as transferee,  has paid over the amount for  which he is\r\n\nliable under  11 U.S.C.    550.  Petitioning  unsecured creditors\r\n\nargue that Karger did not comply with the requirements of Section\r\n\n502(d) because  he did not pay the full amount of the judgment of\r\n\n$459,860.78 plus  interest but  rather settled the  claim against\r\n\nhim by means of a payment of a lesser sum, $400,000.\r\n\n          The legal  query presented  appears to be  unique since\r\n\nthe  parties have not cited nor have we found any authority which\r\n\nspecifically addresses  the precise issue presented  here.  Thus,\r\n\nwe are left to  the task of ascertaining the  legislative purpose\r\n\nand intent, if possible, from  the language employed by Congress.\r\n\nAs we have stated previously, \"'the task of interpretation begins\r\n\nwith  the text of the statute itself, and statutory language must\r\n\nbe accorded its  ordinary meaning.'\"  In Re: Juraj J. Bajgar, 104\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d  495, 497 (1st Cir. 1997), quoting Telematics Int'l, Inc. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nNEMLC Leasing Corp., 967 F.2d 703, 706 (1st Cir. 1992).

A  proof of claim must be disallowed  unless the\r\n\npreference recipient  pays the amount  for which  he is  \"liable\"\r\n\nunder  11 U.S.C.    550.

Once  the preference  recipient  complies with  the\r\n\npayment or  turnover order of the bankruptcy court, it may file a\r\n\nproof of claim.

The difficulty  with application of the  term \"liable\"\r\n\nnamely  is that there are two court actions which determined that\r\n\nthe preference recipient is liable,  the judgment of the District\r\n\nCourt  and  the  Order  of  the  Bankruptcy  Court  approving the\r\n\nsettlement of the preference claim.\r\n\n          The  unsecured  creditors  argue that  the  legislative\r\n\nhistory  of  Section 502(d)  is relevant  to  this inquiry.   The\r\n\nambiguity  is  not  clarified  by reference  to  the  legislative\r\n\nhistory.  In  part, that  history states: \"Subsection  (d) . .  .\r\n\nrequires  disallowance of a claim  of a transferee  of a voidable\r\n\ntransfer in  toto if the  transferee had not  paid the amount  or\r                           \r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nturned over the property received as required under the  sections\r\n\nunder which  the transferee's liability  arises.\"  H.R.

The petitioning unsecured creditors argue that\r\n\nthe inclusion  of  the words  \"in toto\"  indicates that  Congress\r\n\nintended that a creditor  must relinquish the original preference\r\n\namount, precluding any judicial adjustment of  this figure.  They\r\n\nalso cite a  North Dakota Supreme Court case as  support for this\r\n\nproposition that  a creditor  must surrender all  sums previously\r                                                          \r\n\ntransferred.

The court concluded  that\r\n\nthe claim of a creditor should be denied because the creditor had\r\n\nreceived a vaculator machine1 as a  preferential transfer and had\r\n\nnot  returned it.  The creditor  claimed that he had \"since\" paid\r\n\nfor  the machine (apparently after  the record was  closed in the\r\n\nproceedings  below).   The court stated  that the  creditor could\r\n\nbring an appropriate motion for  relief after its mandate issued.\r\n\nAlthough there is an  obvious difference between the return  of a\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   Although the term  'vaculator' is used  sometimes to describe\r\nsurgical devices for the removal of fluid from the human body and\r\nthe  like, in  this  context a  'vaculator  machine' describes  a\r\nsystem used to extract  grain from containers and transfer  it to\r\nother storage facilities.

The\r\n\nunsecured creditors place emphasis  upon the use of the  term \"in\r\n\ntoto\" in the  House of Representatives  historical record.   What\r\n\nthe unsecured creditors have overlooked is the fact that the term\r\n\n\"in  toto\" refers to  the unsecured claim  of the recipient  of a\r\n\npreferential  transfer and not, as they would have it, the amount\r\n\nfor which  the  transferee is  liable.   Thus,  this  legislative\r\n\nhistory does not clarify the purpose of Congress.\r\n\n          We  must ask,  how  would Congress  have answered  this\r\n\nquestion?  Guided by the actual language used, we may look to the\r\n\npractical  effect of  the arguments made.   See Dames  &amp; Moore v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nRegan, 453 U.S.  654, 673-74 (1981);  Chapman v.

There is guidance in the\r                     \r\n\ncogent language used by  the Bankruptcy Court that to  accept the\r\n\nunsecured   creditors'   contentions   would  rob   post-judgment\r\n\nsettlements of  their  \"essential vitality.\"    See In  re  Melon\r                                                                           \r\n\nProduce, 162  B.R. at  388.   It is an  unfortunate axiom  that a\r                 \r\n\njudgment  does  not always  guarantee  collection.   Indeed,  the\r\n\neasiest  judgment to  obtain is  usually one  that will  never be\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\npaid.  The  circumstances of the  settlement with Karger  suggest\r\n\nthat  collection of the full amount could have been an impossible\r\n\ntask and  could have involved  the estate  in lengthy,  expensive\r\n\nlitigation to the detriment of the unsecured creditors. \r\n\n          Thus a  construction of the statute  which requires the\r\n\nlast penny to be paid could cause the unsecured  creditors to, in\r\n\neffect, submit  to an all-or-nothing situation.   The petitioning\r\n\nunsecured  creditors' argument would preclude half or any part of\r\n\nthe loaf from being satisfactory, thereby preventing the bankrupt\r\n\nestate from  being at  least  partially nourished.   The  purpose\r\n\nought to be  to encourage  the collection of  the largest  amount\r\n\npossible  to provide  a  dividend or  a  better dividend  to  the\r\n\nunsecured creditors.\r\n\n          Experience  suggests that  few unsecured  creditors can\r\n\nexpect satisfaction  of their claims  in whole or  in substantial\r\n\npart.  More  than two decades ago it was  reported that unsecured\r\n\ncreditors  in business bankruptcies  receive an average  of 8% of\r\n\nthe  amounts  proved  and  allowed, while  general  creditors  in\r\n\npersonal bankruptcies  receive an average of 7%  of their allowed\r\n\nclaims.  See David Stanley &amp; Marjorie Girth, Bankruptcy: Problem,\r                                                                           \r\n\nProcess, Reform 130  (1971).   There is nothing  to signify  that\r                         \r\n\nthere  has been any recent  substantial improvement in the extent\r\n\nof  the recoveries  of unsecured  creditors.   The Administrative\r\n\nOffice  of the U.S. Courts  reports a higher  average dividend in\r\n\nChapter  11 reorganization cases - 32% - but that figure includes\r\n\nboth the  amounts  actually paid  and  the amounts  that  debtors\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\npromised  to pay after the  reorganization case was  closed.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nAdmin. Office of  the U.S. Cts., Tables  of Bankruptcy Statistics\r\n\nA-32 (1978).  However, the latter may be merely paper obligations\r\n\nwhich may be  discounted again  in a recurrence  of the  debtor's\r\n\nfinancial difficulties.  See id.   Despite the lack of any recent\r                                          \r\n\nempirical  studies, certainly it is safe to expect that in almost\r\n\nevery bankruptcy unsecured creditors are likely to receive only a\r\n\nsmall percentage of their legitimate claims.\r\n\n          The  estate is  protected against  manipulation because\r\n\nsettlements must  be approved  by  the Bankruptcy  Court after  a\r\n\nconsideration of  the circumstances of the  settlement.  Approval\r\n\nis a  discretionary  function  and  may be  reviewed  for  abuse.\r\n\nHence, a small settlement which results in a substantial dividend\r\n\nto the preferential transferee is not likely to pass muster.\r\n\n          Finally,  this result  is consistent  with the  overall\r\n\npurpose of  Section 502, which  was not  \"to punish, but  to give\r\n\ncreditors  an option  to keep  their transfers  (and hope  for no\r\n\naction  by the trustee) or to surrender their transfers and their\r\n\nadvantages and  share equally with other creditors.\"   Tidwell v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAtlanta Gas  Light Co. (In re Georgia  Steel, Inc.), 38 B.R. 829,\r                                                             \r\n\n839 (Bankr. M.D. Ga. 1984).    Karger chose the latter option and\r\n\npaid $400,000 to the Trustee.  If faced with the option of paying\r\n\nthe full amount  of the judgment in order to file his claim as an\r\n\nunsecured  creditor  (apart  from  whether  or  not  he  had  the\r\n\nwherewithal to do so), the result might well  have been a lengthy\r\n\nand only partially  successful or even an unsuccessful  effort to\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nobtain  satisfaction of  the  judgment  in  full.   The  expenses\r\n\nincurred to collect the  judgment in full or  in part could  have\r\n\ndiminished the return to the  estate to less than $400,000.   The\r\n\npractical  effect of  the position  advocated by  the petitioning\r\n\nunsecured creditors compels us to conclude that  Congress did not\r\n\nintend that unsecured creditors be denied their claims, if having\r\n\nreceived a preferential transfer, they do  not satisfy a judgment\r\n\narising  out of  the  transfer in  full and  with  interest.   We\r\n\nbelieve that Congress intended some play in the joints and that a\r\n\ncourt-approved  settlement  of  such  a  judgment  satisfies  the\r\n\nrequirement that  the preferential  transferee has paid  that for\r\n\nwhich  he  is liable.   We  therefore  agree with  the Bankruptcy\r\n\nCourt.  We  hold that  pursuant to Section  550(a)(1) Karger  was\r\n\nliable  for the sum of $400,000 and therefore his unsecured claim\r\n\nwas properly allowed.  \r\n\n          B.  Equitable Subordination\r                    B.  Equitable Subordination\r\n\n          The ultimate  ruling of  the Bankruptcy Court  was that\r\n\nthe  unsecured creditors  were  barred  by  the approval  of  the\r\n\nsettlement between Karger and the Trustee.  Bankruptcy Court Rule\r\n\n9019 requires notice to interested parties prior to approval of a\r\n\nsettlement.   See 11 U.S.C. Part IX,  Rule 9019(a).  The rule was\r                           \r\n\ncomplied  with  since  the petitioning  unsecured  creditors  had\r\n\nnotice  of and  did in  fact appear  and object  to  the proposed\r\n\nsettlement.   The  unsecured creditors  vigorously pressed  their\r\n\nargument that Karger's unsecured  claim should be subordinated to\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\ntheir  unsecured  claims.    The Bankruptcy  Court  approved  the\r\n\nsettlement which included a provision that \"the Trustee shall not\r\n\nobject to the allowance of Karger's unsecured claim in the amount\r\n\nof  $400,000.\"  The unsecured  creditors did not  appeal from the\r\n\napproval  of the  settlement  agreement between  the Trustee  and\r\n\nKarger.     Although  the   Bankruptcy  Judge  stated   that  the\r\n\npetitioning unsecured creditors could ask for  a later hearing on\r\n\nthe equitable subordination issue, this statement was in error.\r\n\n          Counsel should not take such a prediction by a judge as\r\n\ngospel, but should act  diligently to protect the record  and his\r\n\nor her client's right to appeal.  See Morrissey v. Nat'l Maritime\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnion of America, 544 F.2d 19, 32 (2d Cir. 1976) (\"While  counsel\r                          \r\n\nseeks to  excuse [the failure to  make an offer of  proof] on the\r\n\nbasis of  the judge's statement on  the telephone . .  . this did\r\n\nnot  relieve counsel  of  his  duty  to  protect  the  record.\").\r\n\nCounsel must not rely upon the judge to make the case  for him or\r\n\nher.   As observed in Marshak  v. Tonetti, \"[j]udges from time to\r                                                   \r\n\ntime will make mistakes.

Tonetti, 813  F.2d 13, 17 (1st  Cir. 1987).\r                                       \r\n\nIf the equitable subordination issue was to be considered at all,\r\n\nit  should have  been addressed  at the  time of  the settlement.\r\n\nOtherwise,  there  is  no  reason  for  a settlement,  since  the\r\n\nsettling parties are  neither protected from further  unfavorable\r\n\nconsequences  nor  allowed  to enjoy  the  safe  harbor of  their\r\n\nsettlement arrangement.\r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\n          Furthermore,  the  principles of  res  judicata dictate\r\n\nthat the petitioning unsecured  creditors should not be permitted\r\n\nto  bring this issue  on appeal.   \"Under  res judicata,  a final\r\n\njudgment  on the  merits of  an action  precludes the  parties or\r\n\ntheir  privies from relitigating  issues that were  or could have\r\n\nbeen raised in  that action.\"  Allen v.

A  trustee in\r\n\nbankruptcy is a fiduciary  representing the estate and creditors.\r\n\nIn re Medomak  Canning, 922 F.2d  at 901, citing  In re Thu  Viet\r                                                                           \r\n\nDinh,  80 B.R. 819, 822 (Bankr.

The finality of court-approved settlements such as  this\r\n\none is  important, especially to the  efficient administration of\r\n\nthe estate and to reassure settling parties that the trustee will\r\n\nnot  relitigate the settled claims.   See In  re Medomak Canning,\r                                                                          \r\n\n922 F.2d at 901. \r\n\n          The Trustee is ordinarily the appropriate party to seek\r\n\nequitable  subordination on  behalf of  the estate  and unsecured\r\n\ncreditors.  In re Medomak Canning, 922 F.2d at 902.  As unsecured\r                                           \r\n\ncreditors, appellants could not  in these circumstances evade the\r\n\nresponsibility of looking to the Trustee in the first instance as\r\n\ntheir fiduciary and representative to vindicate  their interests,\r\n\nincluding   even    their   interest   in    pursuing   equitable\r\n\nsubordination.   Id.   In  this case,  the Trustee  chose  not to\r                             \r\n\npetition the court for  equitable subordination of Karger's claim\r\n\nand  that choice was approved  by the Bankruptcy  Court.  Because\r\n\nthe Trustee  was acting for the  petitioning unsecured creditors,\r\n\nthey  are  bound  by  the  Trustee's  actions.    The  principles\r\n\nenunciated  in  In   re  Medomak  Canning,  922   F.2d  895,  are\r                                                   \r\n\ncontrolling.    Therefore, the  petitioning  unsecured creditors'\r\n\nequitable subordination claim is barred  by the principles of res\r\n\njudicata.\r\n\n                         III.

BACKGROUND\r\n\n          In August  1984, Karger, the unsecured creditor, loaned\r\n\n$632,000 to  A. Pellegrino  &amp; Son,  Inc.  (\"Pellegrino\").   Melon\r\n\nProduce,  Inc.  (\"Melon  Produce\")  was  incorporated  to  secure\r\n\nKarger's  loans to Pellegrino, then in a proceeding under Chapter\r\n\n11  of the Bankruptcy Code.  Karger was Melon Produce's president\r\n\nand  sole shareholder.   The  Bankruptcy Court  approved Karger's\r\n\nloans, the  transfer of three shares of  stock in the New England\r\n\nProduce Center (\"NEPC\") and leasehold interests in three  bays at\r\n\nNEPC from Pellegrino to Melon Produce for the purpose of securing\r\n\nKarger's  loans, and Melon  Produce gave a  guaranty and security\r\n\ninterest  to Karger which included all \"instruments\" and \"all . .\r\n\n.  rights . . .  to the  payment of  money\" including  a security\r\n\ninterest  in \"all such  assets hereinafter acquired.\"   The three\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nbays and the shares  of stock were  not included in the  security\r\n\ninterests identified.   On February 27, 1987,  Melon Produce sold\r\n\nits three bays and shares of NEPC stock and paid Karger, its only\r\n\nsecured creditor, $430,022.39 from the proceeds.\r\n\n          Within a year of the payment to  Karger, an involuntary\r\n\nproceeding  against   Melon  Produce  under  Chapter   7  of  the\r\n\nBankruptcy Code was initiated  by three unsecured creditors.   On\r\n\nMarch  22, 1990,  Joseph Braunstein,  the  Chapter 7  Trustee for\r\n\nMelon Produce  (\"Trustee\"), brought  an action against  Karger in\r\n\nthe  Bankruptcy  Court.   The  complaint  alleged a  preferential\r\n\ntransfer  and a  fraudulent transfer  of property  of the  estate\r\n\nunder  the  Bankruptcy  Code  and  a  fraudulent  transfer  under\r\n\nMassachusetts state law. \r\n\n          The proceeding was transferred  to the District  Court.\r\n\nOn January  8, 1991,  the District  Court  granted the  Trustee's\r\n\nmotion for entry of final judgment  as to Count I, the preference\r\n\nclaim,  and the  Trustee's motion  for assessment  of prejudgment\r\n\ninterest.   The  District  Court entered  final  judgment on  the\r\n\nmerits,  awarding damages on Count I in the amount of $430,022.39\r\n\nplus  pre-judgment interest  in the  amount of  $29,838.39.   All\r\n\nother  counts were dismissed.   On September 29,  1992, the final\r\n\njudgment  was  upheld upon  appeal by  this Court.   In  re Melon\r                                                                           \r\n\nProduce, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591390\"><a href=\"/opinion/591390/in-re-melon-produce-inc-debtor-joseph-braunstein-trustee-v-peter/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1992).\r                       \r\n\n          The  Trustee  and Karger  agreed  to  a Stipulation  of\r\n\nSettlement on  June  18, 1993.   The  Trustee had  filed a  post-\r\n\njudgment motion  to require  Karger to satisfy  the indebtedness,\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nand sought the appointment  of a Special Master for  the purposes\r\n\nof  taking  possession of  and selling  shares  of stock  held by\r\n\nKarger  in two  unrelated  corporations.   The  Trustee also  had\r\n\nbrought an action seeking to set aside as a fraudulent conveyance\r\n\nthe interest  of  Karger's wife,  Susan Karger,  in certain  real\r\n\nproperty held by her and Karger as tenants-by-the-entirety.  \r\n\n          The  stipulation stated  that Karger  had  asserted and\r\n\nrepresented  that  he  was  unable  financially  to  satisfy  the\r\n\njudgment  in full.   In  support of  this assertion,  Karger made\r\n\ncertain   financial   disclosures  to   the   Trustee,  including\r\n\nsubmitting to a deposition  by the Trustee and producing  his tax\r\n\nreturns and other work papers for review by the Trustee.   Karger\r\n\noffered  to pay  the  sum of  $400,000,  in satisfaction  of  the\r\n\njudgment and his and his  wife's obligations and indebtedness  to\r\n\nthe Trustee.   Due to  the uncertainty with  respect to  Karger's\r\n\nfinancial  situation  and the  question  of  Karger's ability  to\r\n\nsatisfy the judgment,  and given the uncertainty with  respect to\r\n\nthe valuation  of Karger's  stock in the  unrelated corporations,\r\n\nthe Trustee  agreed to  seek  the approval  of Karger's  $400,000\r\n\noffer from the Bankruptcy Court according to the following terms:\r\n\n            If  the  Settlement  Amount is  paid  [by\r\n            Karger] on or before the Settlement Date,\r\n            the  Trustee shall accept such payment in\r\n            satisfaction of Karger's obligations, and\r\n            the  Trustee shall mark  the judgment and\r\n            any  execution  therefor 'satisfied'  and\r\n            return same  to Karger.  . . .  If Karger\r\n            pays   the   Settlement  Amount   by  the\r\n            Settlement  Date,  the Trustee  shall not\r\n            object  to  the  allowance   of  Karger's\r\n            unsecured   claim   in   the  amount   of\r\n            $400,000. . . . If this settlement is not\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n            approved by the Bankruptcy Court or if an\r\n            appeal is  taken from an  order approving\r\n            this settlement and the order  is stayed,\r\n            then at the  sole option of  the Trustee,\r\n            the Trustee may  declare the  Stipulation\r\n            and    settlement    null    and    void.\r\n            Thereafter,  the  Trustee may  pursue his\r\n            rights   and  remedies   against  Karger,\r\n            including,  but  not   limited  to,   the\r\n            appointment of the Special Master to sell\r\n            the [corporate]  stock of Karger  and the\r\n            fraudulent   conveyance  action   against\r\n            Peter and Susan Karger.  \r\n\n          The petitioning unsecured creditors filed  an objection\r\n\nto the  Trustee's motion  to approve the  settlement stipulation,\r\n\nseeking the  denial of the Trustee's application  for approval of\r\n\nthe  stipulation,   or,   in  the   alternative,  the   equitable\r\n\nsubordination of  Karger's unsecured claim  to the claims  of the\r\n\nother  unsecured creditors.   On  July 22,  1993,  the Bankruptcy\r\n\nCourt  heard  the  motion  and  approved  the  settlement.    The\r\n\nunsecured  creditors argued  that  the settlement  should not  be\r\n\napproved because  the settlement provided that  the Trustee would\r\n\nnot object to Karger's unsecured claim of $400,000 and Karger was\r\n\nto pay  less than the full amount of the preference judgment. The\r\n\ntrustee  advised the  Bankruptcy Court  that he  did not  wish to\r\n\npursue   equitable  subordination  of   Karger's  $400,000  claim\r\n\nbecause, having succeeded on  the issue of preferential transfer,\r\n\nhe  did  not want  to  go  through \".  .  .  another war.\"    The\r\n\nBankruptcy Court  stated  that 11  U.S.C.    502(d)  permits  the\r\n\npetitioning unsecured creditors to object to the allowance of the\r\n\nclaim stating that \"[y]ou  could press that [claim  for equitable\r\n\nsubordination] even if the trustee rolls over and plays dead\" and\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthat they, the  objecting unsecured creditors,  \"can come in  and\r\n\nask for  equitable subordination.\"   The  context of  the court's\r\n\nstatement is  clear that  objections to Karger's  unsecured claim\r\n\ncould  be made  later \"and we'll  have a  hearing on  that.\"  The\r\n\npetitioning  unsecured creditors  did  not appeal  the Bankruptcy\r\n\nCourt's order  approving the settlement.   On September  2, 1993,\r\n\nKarger paid the $400,000 settlement to the Trustee.\r\n\n          The  petitioning  unsecured  creditors  then  filed  an\r\n\nobjection to Karger's claim in Bankruptcy Court.  On November 26,\r\n\n1993,  the petitioning  unsecured  creditors filed  a Motion  for\r\n\nSummary  Judgment  in  Bankruptcy  Court,  arguing that  Karger's\r\n\nunsecured  claim should be denied pursuant to 11 U.S.C.   502(d),\r\n\nor,  in the alternative, that  Karger's claim should be equitably\r\n\nsubordinated pursuant  to  11 U.S.C.     510(c).   The  creditors\r\n\nargued that the claim should be disallowed because Section 502(d)\r\n\nstates that \"the  court shall  disallow any claim  of any  entity\r\n\nfrom which  property is recoverable  . . . unless  such entity or\r\n\ntransferee has paid the amount, or turned over any such property,\r\n\nfor  which such entity or  transferee is liable.\"   The unsecured\r\n\ncreditors  argued  that   Karger's  unsecured  claim   should  be\r\n\ndisallowed   because  the  full amount  of  the judgment  against\r\n\nKarger was in fact not paid.  11 U.S.C.   502(d).\r\n\n          The unsecured creditors also argued that Karger's claim\r\n\nshould be  subordinated to their  unsecured claims.   This action\r\n\nwould increase the dividend to the unsecured creditors other than\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nKarger.  Section 510(c) authorizes the Bankruptcy Court to  apply\r\n\nequitable subordination principles to claims.\r\n\n          On December  28, 1993, the Bankruptcy  Court denied the\r\n\nMotion  for  Summary  Judgment  and  entered  an  order  allowing\r\n\nKarger's unsecured  claim in the amount  of $400,000.  See  In re\r                                                                           \r\n\nMelon Produce,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523223\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523223/in-re-melon-produce-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (Bankr.

The Court\r                       \r\n\nfound that  the petitioning  unsecured creditors' Section  502(d)\r\n\nargument  failed on  the grounds  that Karger  had paid  the full\r\n\namount of  the $400,000  settlement, that the  Bankruptcy Court's\r\n\norder  approving  the  settlement  stipulation had  adjusted  the\r\n\namount of  the preference downward,  and that \"to  rule otherwise\r\n\nwould deprive the settlement  of its essential vitality.\"   As to\r\n\nthe petitioning unsecured creditors' Section 510(c) argument, the\r\n\nCourt found that \"[t]he claims are primarily  derivative from the\r\n\nsame  facts set forth in the Trustee's complaint seeking to avoid\r\n\na  fraudulent transfer.  While the Trustee did not seek equitable\r\n\nsubordination of  Karger's claim . . . he might well have done so\r\n\nbased  upon the  facts of the  matter, and res  judicata bars all\r\n\navailable  grounds for  recovery,  regardless of  whether or  not\r\n\nasserted.\"   The Bankruptcy Court  cited this court's  opinion in\r\n\nBezanson v.

On April\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n7,  1994,  the District  Court  affirmed  the Bankruptcy  Court's\r\n\nruling on the issues relating to the effect of the failure to pay\r\n\nthe full amount of the judgment against Karger  and  \"remanded to\r\n\nthe  Bankruptcy  Court  the  issue of  whether  [the  petitioning\r\n\nunsecured  creditors] should  be  allowed to  object to  Karger's\r\n\nclaim on equitable subordination grounds.\"\r\n\n          On  July  5,  1995,   the  Bankruptcy  Court  issued  a\r\n\nMemorandum  Decision,  in which  it  ruled  that the  petitioning\r\n\nunsecured  creditors  were  precluded   by  the  settlement  from\r\n\nobjecting to  Karger's unsecured  claim.   In  its Decision,  the\r\n\nBankruptcy  Court  resolved  the  uncertainties  created  by  its\r\n\nutterance of July 22, 1993 and its published decision of December\r\n\n28, 1993.   The Court  stated that its  initial pronouncement  on\r\n\nJuly 22, 1993, which stated  that 11 U.S.C.   502(a) permits  the\r\n\npetitioning unsecured creditors to object to the allowance of the\r\n\nclaim and that the petitioning unsecured  creditors could ask for\r\n\na hearing  on the  equitable subordination issue,  was in  error.\r\n\nWith  the  benefit  of  the motions  for  summary  judgment,  the\r\n\nBankruptcy  Court  had come  to  the opposite  conclusion  in its\r\n\npublished decision of December  28, 1993.  In that  decision, the\r\n\nBankruptcy Court  held the  petitioning unsecured creditors  were\r\n\nprecluded from raising [the equitable subordination] issue, based\r\n\nprimarily  upon this court's  opinion in  In re  Medomak Canning.\r                                                                          \r\n\nThe Bankruptcy Court now  upheld the December 28, 1993  decision,\r\n\nholding that In re  Medomak Canning was controlling and  that the\r                                             \r\n\npetitioning unsecured  creditors were not entitled  to pursue the\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nequitable  subordination issue  further.

The Bankruptcy Court gave notice to the parties\r\n\nof the appeal timetable on July 17, 1995.  On  September 5, 1995,\r\n\nthe record for the  case on appeal was assembled  and transmitted\r\n\nto the District Court.  Although the District Court did not issue\r\n\na notice to the parties of the entry of the appeal on the docket,\r\n\nthe petitioning  unsecured  creditors had  actual  knowledge  for\r\n\nseveral months of the docketing of the appeal.  Since the  filing\r\n\nof  the  appeal, the  petitioning  unsecured  creditors had  been\r\n\nmonitoring the status of the proceeding on  the Court's computer-\r\n\noperated Pacer System.\r\n\n          The petitioning  unsecured creditors  did not  file and\r\n\nserve  a brief within fifteen days  after the entry of the appeal\r\n\non  the District  Court docket,  as required  by Bankruptcy  Rule\r\n\n8009.  On February 27, 1996,  the District Court entered an order\r\n\ndismissing the  appeal for the petitioning  creditors' failure to\r\n\nprosecute the  appeal.

While it  is true  that federal\r\n\ncourts  of appeal generally do not  rule on issues not decided in\r\n\nthe district court, we  do have discretion to address  issues not\r\n\nreached  by the district  court when the  question is essentially\r\n\nlegal and the record is complete.

Here,  the substantive underlying issues  are legal in\r\n\nnature and the record  is complete.  Furthermore, this  cause has\r\n\nalready involved  the  attention  of this  court  on  an  earlier\r\n\noccasion.   We address  the substantive underlying  issues in the\r\n\nhope  that this litigation may sooner, rather than later, come to\r\n\na conclusion.\r\n\n          A.  Disallowance of Claim\r                    A.  Disallowance of Claim\r\n\n          The petitioning unsecured creditors argue that Karger's\r\n\nclaim  should  be disallowed,  as  Karger  received a  judicially\r\n\ndetermined preferential transfer and has not paid the  amount for\r\n\nwhich he is liable because of the preferential transfer.  Section\r\n\n502(d) of the Bankruptcy Code governs the disallowance of claims.\r\n\nIt reads as follows:\r\n\n          (d)  Notwithstanding  subsections (a)  and  (b) of\r\n     this section, the court shall disallow any claim of any\r\n     entity from which property is recoverable under section\r\n     542,  543, 550,  or 553  of  this title  or  that is  a\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n     transferee   of  a  transfer  avoidable  under  section\r\n     522(f), 522(h), 544, 545,  547, 548, 549, or 724(a)  of\r\n     this title,  unless such entity or  transferee has paid\r\n     the amount, or turned over any such property, for which\r\n     such  entity  or  transferee  is liable  under  section\r\n     522(i), 542, 543, 550, or 553 of this title.  \r\n\nIn  1992, this  court held  that Karger  was the  recipient of  a\r\n\nvoidable transfer.  See In re Melon Produce, 976 F.2d at 76.\r                                                     \r\n\n          The  remaining  issue,  therefore, is  to  determine if\r\n\nKarger, as transferee,  has paid over the amount for  which he is\r\n\nliable under  11 U.S.C.    550.  Petitioning  unsecured creditors\r\n\nargue that Karger did not comply with the requirements of Section\r\n\n502(d) because  he did not pay the full amount of the judgment of\r\n\n$459,860.78 plus  interest but  rather settled the  claim against\r\n\nhim by means of a payment of a lesser sum, $400,000.\r\n\n          The legal  query presented  appears to be  unique since\r\n\nthe  parties have not cited nor have we found any authority which\r\n\nspecifically addresses  the precise issue presented  here.  Thus,\r\n\nwe are left to  the task of ascertaining the  legislative purpose\r\n\nand intent, if possible, from  the language employed by Congress.\r\n\nAs we have stated previously, \"'the task of interpretation begins\r\n\nwith  the text of the statute itself, and statutory language must\r\n\nbe accorded its  ordinary meaning.'\"  In Re: Juraj J.

The difficulty  with application of the  term \"liable\"\r\n\nnamely  is that there are two court actions which determined that\r\n\nthe preference recipient is liable,  the judgment of the District\r\n\nCourt  and  the  Order  of  the  Bankruptcy  Court  approving the\r\n\nsettlement of the preference claim.\r\n\n          The  unsecured  creditors  argue that  the  legislative\r\n\nhistory  of  Section 502(d)  is relevant  to  this inquiry.

The petitioning unsecured creditors argue that\r\n\nthe inclusion  of  the words  \"in toto\"  indicates that  Congress\r\n\nintended that a creditor  must relinquish the original preference\r\n\namount, precluding any judicial adjustment of  this figure.

What\r\n\nthe unsecured creditors have overlooked is the fact that the term\r\n\n\"in  toto\" refers to  the unsecured claim  of the recipient  of a\r\n\npreferential  transfer and not, as they would have it, the amount\r\n\nfor which  the  transferee is  liable.

There is guidance in the\r                     \r\n\ncogent language used by  the Bankruptcy Court that to  accept the\r\n\nunsecured   creditors'   contentions   would  rob   post-judgment\r\n\nsettlements of  their  \"essential vitality.\"    See In  re  Melon\r                                                                           \r\n\nProduce, 162  B.R. at  388.   It is an  unfortunate axiom  that a\r                 \r\n\njudgment  does  not always  guarantee  collection.   Indeed,  the\r\n\neasiest  judgment to  obtain is  usually one  that will  never be\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\npaid.  The  circumstances of the  settlement with Karger  suggest\r\n\nthat  collection of the full amount could have been an impossible\r\n\ntask and  could have involved  the estate  in lengthy,  expensive\r\n\nlitigation to the detriment of the unsecured creditors. \r\n\n          Thus a  construction of the statute  which requires the\r\n\nlast penny to be paid could cause the unsecured  creditors to, in\r\n\neffect, submit  to an all-or-nothing situation.   The petitioning\r\n\nunsecured  creditors' argument would preclude half or any part of\r\n\nthe loaf from being satisfactory, thereby preventing the bankrupt\r\n\nestate from  being at  least  partially nourished.   The  purpose\r\n\nought to be  to encourage  the collection of  the largest  amount\r\n\npossible  to provide  a  dividend or  a  better dividend  to  the\r\n\nunsecured creditors.\r\n\n          Experience  suggests that  few unsecured  creditors can\r\n\nexpect satisfaction  of their claims  in whole or  in substantial\r\n\npart.  More  than two decades ago it was  reported that unsecured\r\n\ncreditors  in business bankruptcies  receive an average  of 8% of\r\n\nthe  amounts  proved  and  allowed, while  general  creditors  in\r\n\npersonal bankruptcies  receive an average of 7%  of their allowed\r\n\nclaims.  See David Stanley &amp; Marjorie Girth, Bankruptcy: Problem,\r                                                                           \r\n\nProcess, Reform 130  (1971).   There is nothing  to signify  that\r                         \r\n\nthere  has been any recent  substantial improvement in the extent\r\n\nof  the recoveries  of unsecured  creditors.   The Administrative\r\n\nOffice  of the U.S. Courts  reports a higher  average dividend in\r\n\nChapter  11 reorganization cases - 32% - but that figure includes\r\n\nboth the  amounts  actually paid  and  the amounts  that  debtors\r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\npromised  to pay after the  reorganization case was  closed.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nAdmin. Office of  the U.S. Cts., Tables  of Bankruptcy Statistics\r\n\nA-32 (1978).  However, the latter may be merely paper obligations\r\n\nwhich may be  discounted again  in a recurrence  of the  debtor's\r\n\nfinancial difficulties.  See id.   Despite the lack of any recent\r                                          \r\n\nempirical  studies, certainly it is safe to expect that in almost\r\n\nevery bankruptcy unsecured creditors are likely to receive only a\r\n\nsmall percentage of their legitimate claims.\r\n\n          The  estate is  protected against  manipulation because\r\n\nsettlements must  be approved  by  the Bankruptcy  Court after  a\r\n\nconsideration of  the circumstances of the  settlement.  Approval\r\n\nis a  discretionary  function  and  may be  reviewed  for  abuse.\r\n\nHence, a small settlement which results in a substantial dividend\r\n\nto the preferential transferee is not likely to pass muster.\r\n\n          Finally,  this result  is consistent  with the  overall\r\n\npurpose of  Section 502, which  was not  \"to punish, but  to give\r\n\ncreditors  an option  to keep  their transfers  (and hope  for no\r\n\naction  by the trustee) or to surrender their transfers and their\r\n\nadvantages and  share equally with other creditors.\"   Tidwell v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nAtlanta Gas  Light Co.

M.D. Ga. 1984).    Karger chose the latter option and\r\n\npaid $400,000 to the Trustee.  If faced with the option of paying\r\n\nthe full amount  of the judgment in order to file his claim as an\r\n\nunsecured  creditor  (apart  from  whether  or  not  he  had  the\r\n\nwherewithal to do so), the result might well  have been a lengthy\r\n\nand only partially  successful or even an unsuccessful  effort to\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nobtain  satisfaction of  the  judgment  in  full.   The  expenses\r\n\nincurred to collect the  judgment in full or  in part could  have\r\n\ndiminished the return to the  estate to less than $400,000.   The\r\n\npractical  effect of  the position  advocated by  the petitioning\r\n\nunsecured creditors compels us to conclude that  Congress did not\r\n\nintend that unsecured creditors be denied their claims, if having\r\n\nreceived a preferential transfer, they do  not satisfy a judgment\r\n\narising  out of  the  transfer in  full and  with  interest.   We\r\n\nbelieve that Congress intended some play in the joints and that a\r\n\ncourt-approved  settlement  of  such  a  judgment  satisfies  the\r\n\nrequirement that  the preferential  transferee has paid  that for\r\n\nwhich  he  is liable.   We  therefore  agree with  the Bankruptcy\r\n\nCourt.  We  hold that  pursuant to Section  550(a)(1) Karger  was\r\n\nliable  for the sum of $400,000 and therefore his unsecured claim\r\n\nwas properly allowed.  \r\n\n          B.  Equitable Subordination\r                    B.  Equitable Subordination\r\n\n          The ultimate  ruling of  the Bankruptcy Court  was that\r\n\nthe  unsecured creditors  were  barred  by  the approval  of  the\r\n\nsettlement between Karger and the Trustee.  Bankruptcy Court Rule\r\n\n9019 requires notice to interested parties prior to approval of a\r\n\nsettlement.   See 11 U.S.C. Part IX,  Rule 9019(a).  The rule was\r                           \r\n\ncomplied  with  since  the petitioning  unsecured  creditors  had\r\n\nnotice  of and  did in  fact appear  and object  to  the proposed\r\n\nsettlement.   The  unsecured creditors  vigorously pressed  their\r\n\nargument that Karger's unsecured  claim should be subordinated to\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\ntheir  unsecured  claims.    The Bankruptcy  Court  approved  the\r\n\nsettlement which included a provision that \"the Trustee shall not\r\n\nobject to the allowance of Karger's unsecured claim in the amount\r\n\nof  $400,000.\"  The unsecured  creditors did not  appeal from the\r\n\napproval  of the  settlement  agreement between  the Trustee  and\r\n\nKarger.     Although  the   Bankruptcy  Judge  stated   that  the\r\n\npetitioning unsecured creditors could ask for  a later hearing on\r\n\nthe equitable subordination issue, this statement was in error.\r\n\n          Counsel should not take such a prediction by a judge as\r\n\ngospel, but should act  diligently to protect the record  and his\r\n\nor her client's right to appeal.
