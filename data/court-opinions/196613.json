The Egg Products Inspection Act and Section X(F)\r\n\n    Although not a state, the Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico is  subject\r\n\nto the constraints  of the Dormant Commerce Clause  to the same degree\r\n\nas are the states.

In the proceedings below, the district\r\n\ncourt  ruled  that  the regulation  in  question,  Puerto Rico  Market\r\n\nRegulation  Number 3,  section X(F),  was  an impermissible  burden on\r\n\ninterstate commerce  hence invalid under the  Dormant Commerce Clause.\r\n                    \r                            \r\n\n    1United  Egg Producers  is  an Atlanta,  Georgia,  national  trade\r\nassociation  whose  members  include  egg producers  in  every  state.\r\nInstituto  Puertorrique o de Carnes, Inc., is a San Juan, Puerto Rico,\r\ntrade  association  representing  Puerto Rican  distributors  of  food\r\nproducts.\r\n\n                                  3\r\r\n\nSection  X(F) requires the labeling of eggs imported from elsewhere in\r\n\nthe United States into Puerto Rico:\r\n\n    Imported  eggs to be marketed  in Puerto Rico  shall have the\r\n    letters from  the state of origin  if produced in a  state of\r\n    the  United  States using  the  initials  established by  the\r\n    United  States Postal Service, . .  . stamped on each egg, as\r\n    established by the Egg Products  Inspection Act (21 USC 1031,\r\n    Section 23 b,2).\r\n\nPuerto  Rico Market Regulation Number  3, section X(F).   Section X(F)\r\n\npurports  to have been promulgated in conformity with the Egg Products\r\n\nInspection Act (EPIA), which provides that: \r\n\n    no  State   or  local   jurisdiction  other  than   those  in\r                                                                         \r\n    noncontiguous areas of the United States may require labeling\r                                                    \r\n    to show the State or other geographical area of production or\r\n    origin.\r\n\n21  U.S.C.    1052(b)(2)  (emphasis supplied).    Puerto Rico  is,  of\r\n\ncourse,  one  of the  noncontiguous  jurisdictions  excepted from  the\r\n\nstatute's prohibition against egg-labeling.  \r\n\n    This appeal presents  two main questions: (1) whether section X(F)\r\n\nof   Puerto  Rico's  Market  Regulation   Number  3  was,  in  effect,\r\n\nCongressionally  authorized, so  as  to be  beyond  the reach  of  the\r\n\nconstraints of the  Dormant Commerce  Clause; and (2)  if the  Dormant\r\n\nCommerce  Clause  is applicable,  whether  section  X(F) impermissibly\r\n\nburdens interstate commerce.  We address each of these issues.\r\n\nII. Congressional Authorization\r        II. Congressional Authorization\r\n\n    The Commerce Clause provides that \"Congress  shall have Power .  .\r\n\n. To regulate Commerce .  . . among the several States.\"   U.S. Const.\r\n\nart.  I,     8,  cl.  3.    The  Supreme  Court  has interpreted  this\r\n\n                                  4\r\r\n\naffirmative grant of authority  to Congress as also  establishing what\r\n\nhas come to be called the Dormant Commerce Clause --  a self-executing\r\n\nlimitation  on  state authority  to  enact  laws imposing  substantial\r\n\nburdens on interstate  commerce even in  the absence of  Congressional\r\n\naction.  See South-Central Timber Dev., Inc. v. Wunnicke, 467 U.S. 82,\r                                                                \r\n\n87 (1984).  The  Dormant Commerce Clause does  not, however, apply  to\r\n\nstate or local regulations directly authorized by Congress.   \"It is .\r\n\n. . clear that  Congress may 'redefine the distribution  of power over\r\n\ninterstate  commerce'  by 'permit[ting]  the  states  to regulate  the\r\n\ncommerce in a manner which would otherwise not be  permissible.'\"  Id.\r                                                                              \r\n\nat 87-88   (quoting Southern Pac.

Thus,  state or  local\r                      \r\n\njurisdictions  operating  under \"Congressional  consent\"  are free  to\r\n\nenact laws burdening interstate commerce. \r\n\n    The standard for finding Congressional consent is, however,  high.\r\n\nCongressional consent to otherwise impermissible state regulation must\r\n\nbe either \"expressly stated,\"   Sporhase v. Nebraska ex  rel. Douglas,\r                                                                             \r\n\n458 U.S. 941, 960 (1982), or \"made unmistakably clear,\" South-Central,\r                                                                             \r\n\n467 U.S. at  91.  The  state or local  jurisdiction (in this case  the\r\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico) has the burden of demonstrating Congress'\r\n\nunmistakably   clear   intent   to   allow   otherwise  discriminatory\r\n\nregulations.  Wyoming v. Oklahoma, 502 U.S. 437, 458 (1992).\r                                         \r\n\n      To  determine if Congressional consent was extended  here, so as\r\n\n                                  5\r\r\n\nto  authorize  Puerto Rico's  labeling  regulation  regardless of  its\r\n\nimpact  on commerce,  we begin  by examining  Congress' language.   In\r\n\nsection  1052(b)(2),   Congress  did  not  state   affirmatively  that\r\n\nnoncontiguous jurisdictions could \"require  labeling to show the State\r\n\nor  other  geographical  area  of production  or  origin.\"    Instead,\r\n\nCongress excepted \"noncontiguous areas of the United States\" including\r\n\nPuerto Rico, from  the blanket  prohibition it was  placing upon  egg-\r\n\nlabeling in all other places. 21 U.S.C.   1052(b)(2).  Read literally,\r\n\n  1052(b)(2) can be said  to go no further than to  exempt Puerto Rico\r\n\nfrom Congress' own egg-labeling ban.  The exemption is consistent with\r\n\nintending to allow Puerto Rico to adopt only egg-labeling requirements\r\n\nthat do not  otherwise violate  the Dormant Commerce  Clause --  i.e.,\r\n\nregulations  justified  by a  legitimate  state interest,  such  as to\r\n\nprotect  the  health of  its  residents,  that could  not  be met  via\r\n\nnondiscriminatory alternatives.2  \r\n\n    To be  sure, the statutory exemption  is perhaps  susceptible to a\r\n\nreading going  beyond the above.   One can argue that  as Congress had\r\n\n                    \r                            \r\n\n    2Before   the   enactment  of      1052(b)(2),   any  egg-labeling\r\nrequirements passed by the  states would have been subject  to Dormant\r\nCommerce Clause analysis and upheld only if they did not substantially\r\nburden interstate commerce or if the burden on interstate commerce was\r\njustified by  a legitimate state  interest.  After the  enactment of  \r\n1052(b)(2), states  in  contiguous areas  of  the United  States  were\r\nprohibited  from enacting any egg-labeling requirements, regardless of\r\nwhether it was possible to compose such a requirement in such a way as\r\nto  withstand Dormant  Commerce Clause  scrutiny.   In addition,  in  \r\n1052(b)(2), Congress indicated a preference for  Puerto Rico and other\r\nnoncontiguous  areas of  the United  States by  specifically exempting\r\nthem from its blanket prohibition on egg-labeling.\r\n\n                                  6\r\r\n\nbefore  it  the  whole  subject  of  egg-labeling,  its  exemption  of\r\n\nnoncontiguous  jurisdictions  must  be   understood  to  signify,   by\r\n\nimplication,  Congressional  approval  of  any  and  all  egg-labeling\r\n\nrequirements  in   those  places   regardless  whether   justified  or\r\n\nunjustified by Dormant Commerce Clause considerations.  But this seems\r\n\nto us a  more extreme  reading than either  the statutory language  or\r\n\nlegislative   history   necessitates.3      Absent,   at   least,   an\r\n\naffirmatively   stated   grant   of   permission    to   noncontiguous\r\n\njurisdictions  of the  United States  to require egg-labeling,  we are\r\n\nunable  to conclude that appellants  have met their  burden of showing\r\n\nthat Congress' intent to allow Puerto Rico to enact protectionist egg-\r\n\nlabeling  regulations was \"unmistakably clear.\"   See e.g.,   Maine v.\r                                                                           \r\n\nTaylor,  477 U.S.  131, 139  (1986) (holding  that state  statutes are\r              \r\n\nexempt \"from  the implied  limitations of  the [Commerce]  Clause only\r\n\nwhen  the congressional  direction  to do  so  has been  'unmistakably\r\n\nclear'\");    South-Central, 467  U.S. at  90  (finding that  \"on those\r                                  \r\n\noccasions  in which consent  has been found,  congressional intent and\r\n                    \r                            \r\n\n    3The  legislative history  of    1052(b)(2) is  silent on  whether\r\nCongress  intended  to immunize  regulations  like  section X(F)  from\r\nDormant Commerce Clause scrutiny.  It  is true that the United  States\r\nDepartment  of Agriculture,  arguing in  opposition to  the exemption,\r\nstated  that   1052(b)(2)'s \"exemption would allow ... Puerto Rico ...\r\nto  require  eggs shipped  from the  continental  United States  to be\r\nlabeled\" and therefore recommended  eliminating the exemption in order\r\nto  \"eliminate trade  barrier labeling requirements.\"   H.R.  Rep. No.\r\n1670, 91st  Cong., 2nd  Sess. (1970).   We  are, however, unsure  what\r\nweight, if any, to accord to the Department's position, given that the\r\nDepartment  did not expressly refer to the Dormant Commerce Clause and\r\ngiven that Congress decided to exempt noncontiguous jurisdictions from\r\nits  prohibition   on  egg-labeling  in  spite   of  the  Department's\r\nobjection.  \r\n\n                                  7\r\r\n\npolicy to insulate state legislation from  Commerce Clause attack have\r\n\nbeen  'expressly stated'\").   We  agree with  the district  court that\r\n\n\"[a]lthough  the  E.P.I.A. permits  noncontiguous  areas  to impose  a\r\n\nlabeling requirement,  the statute does not permit  such a requirement\r\n\nto be  imposed in  a manner  that discriminatorily  burdens interstate\r\n\ncommerce.\"\r\n\nIII. Dormant Commerce Clause Analysis\r        III. Dormant Commerce Clause Analysis\r\n\n    Having  determined  that  section  X(F)  was  not  Congressionally\r\n\nauthorized in  such a fashion  as to exempt  it from  Dormant Commerce\r\n\nClause  scrutiny altogether, we  turn to the  question whether section\r\n\nX(F)  violates  the  Clause.   We  must  decide  whether section  X(F)\r\n\ndiscriminates  against  interstate   commerce  by   disproportionately\r\n\nimpairing out-of-state commerce,  and, if so, whether  Puerto Rico can\r\n\njustify such discrimination.  Trailer Marine, 977 F.2d at 10-12.\r                                                    \r\n\n    A regulation that  discriminates against  interstate commerce  may\r\n\nbe  facially  discriminatory  or  may  be  neutral  on  its  face  but\r\n\ndiscriminatory in effect.  Pike  v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S.  137,\r                                                              \r\n\n142  (1970).   Here,  the Puerto  Rico  Department of  Agriculture has\r\n\npromulgated a regulation which imposes a burden on other United States\r\n\njurisdictions -- namely, egg-labeling -- that is not imposed on Puerto\r\n\nRico.  The record amply supports the district court's finding that \"if\r\n\nenforced,  [section] X(F)  would impose  on mainland  and foreign  egg\r\n\n                                  8\r\r\n\nproducers significant  costs not imposed on  Puerto Rican producers.\"4\r\n\nThus, section X(F) facially discriminates against interstate commerce.\r\n\n    Because section  X(F) discriminates  against interstate  commerce,\r\n\nthe burden falls on  appellants to show  that it \"serves a  legitimate\r\n\nlocal   purpose\"  that   could   not  be   served  \"as   well  without\r\n\ndiscriminating against interstate commerce.\"   Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441\r                                                                         \r\n\nU.S. 332,  336 (1979).   Appellants argue that  section X(F) serves  a\r\n\nlegitimate  state interest  in protecting  the health of  Puerto Rican\r\n\nconsumers.    They  argue  that  imposing a  labeling  requirement  on\r\n\nimported eggs will enable authorities to remove from supermarkets eggs\r\n\nproduced in a geographic area known to be the source of an outbreak of\r\n\nsalmonella  poisoning.   However,  appellants failed  to support  this\r\n\nassertion with any evidence showing (1) whether there is a substantial\r\n\nproblem with  salmonella  in  eggs;  (2) whether  egg-labeling  is  an\r\n\nefficient way to  trace contaminated eggs;5  (3) whether section  X(F)\r\n                    \r                            \r\n\n    4The evidence  produced below  tended  to show  that section  X(F)\r\nwould increase the market price of eggs imported into Puerto Rico from\r\nother  United  States  jurisdictions,  to the  advantage  of  locally-\r\nproduced eggs.  For  example, the Vice President of  Radlo Brothers, a\r\ncompany which exports  eggs to Puerto Rico, testified that in order to\r\ncomply with section  X(F) he would have to purchase  new machinery for\r\neach of his thirty-five  locations from which he ships eggs  to Puerto\r\nRico.   He further testified  that such egg-labeling  would hinder his\r\nability to satisfy his other  clients' emergency needs, because  these\r\nclients would likely not accept labeled eggs.  \r\n\n    5The utility  of egg-labeling as a  means of tracing  contaminated\r\neggs is not self-evident.   Testimony by the Vice President of  United\r\nEgg Producers described  a process  by which tainted  eggs are  traced\r\nback to the farm that produced them through the standard documentation\r\nalready used by packers and producers.\r\n\n                                  9\r\r\n\nwas  passed with  the purpose  of tracing  contaminated eggs;  and (4)\r\n\nwhether eggs imported  from elsewhere  in the United  States are  more\r\n\nlikely to be contaminated than eggs imported from other countries that\r\n\nneed  only be  labeled \"foreign.\"   We  therefore accept  the district\r\n\ncourt's finding that  appellants \"did not offer  evidence proving that\r\n\nthe discriminatory burden of [section] X(F) is justified by any factor\r\n\n'unrelated  to  economic protectionism.'\"    See  New  Energy  Co.  v.\r                                                                          \r\n\nLimbach, 486 U.S. 269, 274 (1988).

Puerto Rico  is,  of\r\n\ncourse,  one  of the  noncontiguous  jurisdictions  excepted from  the\r\n\nstatute's prohibition against egg-labeling.  \r\n\n    This appeal presents  two main questions: (1) whether section X(F)\r\n\nof   Puerto  Rico's  Market  Regulation   Number  3  was,  in  effect,\r\n\nCongressionally  authorized, so  as  to be  beyond  the reach  of  the\r\n\nconstraints of the  Dormant Commerce  Clause; and (2)  if the  Dormant\r\n\nCommerce  Clause  is applicable,  whether  section  X(F) impermissibly\r\n\nburdens interstate commerce.

In\r\n\nsection  1052(b)(2),   Congress  did  not  state   affirmatively  that\r\n\nnoncontiguous jurisdictions could \"require  labeling to show the State\r\n\nor  other  geographical  area  of production  or  origin.\"    Instead,\r\n\nCongress excepted \"noncontiguous areas of the United States\" including\r\n\nPuerto Rico, from  the blanket  prohibition it was  placing upon  egg-\r\n\nlabeling in all other places. 21 U.S.C.   1052(b)(2).  Read literally,\r\n\n  1052(b)(2) can be said  to go no further than to  exempt Puerto Rico\r\n\nfrom Congress' own egg-labeling ban.  The exemption is consistent with\r\n\nintending to allow Puerto Rico to adopt only egg-labeling requirements\r\n\nthat do not  otherwise violate  the Dormant Commerce  Clause --  i.e.,\r\n\nregulations  justified  by a  legitimate  state interest,  such  as to\r\n\nprotect  the  health of  its  residents,  that could  not  be met  via\r\n\nnondiscriminatory alternatives.2  \r\n\n    To be  sure, the statutory exemption  is perhaps  susceptible to a\r\n\nreading going  beyond the above.   One can argue that  as Congress had\r\n\n                    \r                            \r\n\n    2Before   the   enactment  of      1052(b)(2),   any  egg-labeling\r\nrequirements passed by the  states would have been subject  to Dormant\r\nCommerce Clause analysis and upheld only if they did not substantially\r\nburden interstate commerce or if the burden on interstate commerce was\r\njustified by  a legitimate state  interest.  After the  enactment of  \r\n1052(b)(2), states  in  contiguous areas  of  the United  States  were\r\nprohibited  from enacting any egg-labeling requirements, regardless of\r\nwhether it was possible to compose such a requirement in such a way as\r\nto  withstand Dormant  Commerce Clause  scrutiny.   In addition,  in  \r\n1052(b)(2), Congress indicated a preference for  Puerto Rico and other\r\nnoncontiguous  areas of  the United  States by  specifically exempting\r\nthem from its blanket prohibition on egg-labeling.\r\n\n                                  6\r\r\n\nbefore  it  the  whole  subject  of  egg-labeling,  its  exemption  of\r\n\nnoncontiguous  jurisdictions  must  be   understood  to  signify,   by\r\n\nimplication,  Congressional  approval  of  any  and  all  egg-labeling\r\n\nrequirements  in   those  places   regardless  whether   justified  or\r\n\nunjustified by Dormant Commerce Clause considerations.  But this seems\r\n\nto us a  more extreme  reading than either  the statutory language  or\r\n\nlegislative   history   necessitates.3      Absent,   at   least,   an\r\n\naffirmatively   stated   grant   of   permission    to   noncontiguous\r\n\njurisdictions  of the  United States  to require egg-labeling,  we are\r\n\nunable  to conclude that appellants  have met their  burden of showing\r\n\nthat Congress' intent to allow Puerto Rico to enact protectionist egg-\r\n\nlabeling  regulations was \"unmistakably clear.\"   See e.g.,   Maine v.\r                                                                           \r\n\nTaylor,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111715\"><a href=\"/opinion/111715/maine-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 139  (1986) (holding  that state  statutes are\r              \r\n\nexempt \"from  the implied  limitations of  the [Commerce]  Clause only\r\n\nwhen  the congressional  direction  to do  so  has been  'unmistakably\r\n\nclear'\");    South-Central, 467  U.S. at  90  (finding that  \"on those\r                                  \r\n\noccasions  in which consent  has been found,  congressional intent and\r\n                    \r                            \r\n\n    3The  legislative history  of    1052(b)(2) is  silent on  whether\r\nCongress  intended  to immunize  regulations  like  section X(F)  from\r\nDormant Commerce Clause scrutiny.  It  is true that the United  States\r\nDepartment  of Agriculture,  arguing in  opposition to  the exemption,\r\nstated  that   1052(b)(2)'s \"exemption would allow ...

We  must  decide  whether section  X(F)\r\n\ndiscriminates  against  interstate   commerce  by   disproportionately\r\n\nimpairing out-of-state commerce,  and, if so, whether  Puerto Rico can\r\n\njustify such discrimination.

Bruce Church, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r                                                              \r\n\n142  (1970).   Here,  the Puerto  Rico  Department of  Agriculture has\r\n\npromulgated a regulation which imposes a burden on other United States\r\n\njurisdictions -- namely, egg-labeling -- that is not imposed on Puerto\r\n\nRico.  The record amply supports the district court's finding that \"if\r\n\nenforced,  [section] X(F)  would impose  on mainland  and foreign  egg\r\n\n                                  8\r\r\n\nproducers significant  costs not imposed on  Puerto Rican producers.\"4\r\n\nThus, section X(F) facially discriminates against interstate commerce.\r\n\n    Because section  X(F) discriminates  against interstate  commerce,\r\n\nthe burden falls on  appellants to show  that it \"serves a  legitimate\r\n\nlocal   purpose\"  that   could   not  be   served  \"as   well  without\r\n\ndiscriminating against interstate commerce.\"   Hughes v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span>\r                                                                         \r\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  336 (1979).   Appellants argue that  section X(F) serves  a\r\n\nlegitimate  state interest  in protecting  the health of  Puerto Rican\r\n\nconsumers.    They  argue  that  imposing a  labeling  requirement  on\r\n\nimported eggs will enable authorities to remove from supermarkets eggs\r\n\nproduced in a geographic area known to be the source of an outbreak of\r\n\nsalmonella  poisoning.   However,  appellants failed  to support  this\r\n\nassertion with any evidence showing (1) whether there is a substantial\r\n\nproblem with  salmonella  in  eggs;  (2) whether  egg-labeling  is  an\r\n\nefficient way to  trace contaminated eggs;5  (3) whether section  X(F)\r\n                    \r                            \r\n\n    4The evidence  produced below  tended  to show  that section  X(F)\r\nwould increase the market price of eggs imported into Puerto Rico from\r\nother  United  States  jurisdictions,  to the  advantage  of  locally-\r\nproduced eggs.  For  example, the Vice President of  Radlo Brothers, a\r\ncompany which exports  eggs to Puerto Rico, testified that in order to\r\ncomply with section  X(F) he would have to purchase  new machinery for\r\neach of his thirty-five  locations from which he ships eggs  to Puerto\r\nRico.   He further testified  that such egg-labeling  would hinder his\r\nability to satisfy his other  clients' emergency needs, because  these\r\nclients would likely not accept labeled eggs.  \r\n\n    5The utility  of egg-labeling as a  means of tracing  contaminated\r\neggs is not self-evident.   Testimony by the Vice President of  United\r\nEgg Producers described  a process  by which tainted  eggs are  traced\r\nback to the farm that produced them through the standard documentation\r\nalready used by packers and producers.\r\n\n                                  9\r\r\n\nwas  passed with  the purpose  of tracing  contaminated eggs;  and (4)\r\n\nwhether eggs imported  from elsewhere  in the United  States are  more\r\n\nlikely to be contaminated than eggs imported from other countries that\r\n\nneed  only be  labeled \"foreign.\"   We  therefore accept  the district\r\n\ncourt's finding that  appellants \"did not offer  evidence proving that\r\n\nthe discriminatory burden of [section] X(F) is justified by any factor\r\n\n'unrelated  to  economic protectionism.'\"    See  New  Energy  Co.  v.\r                                                                          \r\n\nLimbach, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112081\"><a href=\"/opinion/112081/new-energy-co-of-ind-v-limbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">269</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274 (1988).  We hold that section X(F) violates\r               \r\n\nthe  Dormant Commerce  Clause, and  affirm the  order of  the district\r\n\ncourt  granting  a permanent  injunction  against  the enforcement  of\r\n\nsection X(F).\r\n\nSo Ordered.\r        So Ordered.\r                   \r\n\n                                  10\r\r\n</pre>",
