Francis J. Boyle, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n             Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Robert B. Mann and Mann &amp; Mitchell on brief for appellant.\r\n Sheldon Whitehouse, United States Attorney, Margaret E.\r\nCurran, Assistant United States Attorney, and Ira Belkin, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMay 26, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.   Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we find no reason to overturn the sentence imposed by\r\nthe district court.  \r\n          1.   Pointing to the district court's remark that it\r\nhad no \"doubt that the Defendant now accepts responsibility,\"\r\ndefendant argues that the court found a sincere acceptance of\r\nresponsibility and that nothing more is needed under comment\r\nn.4 to U.S.S.G.  3E1.1 to warrant a reduction.  However, the\r\ncourt effectively qualified the quoted remark by noting that\r\ndefendant had agreed to plead guilty only after his attempt to\r\nobstruct justice failed.  In short, we believe that the\r\ndistrict court reasonably noted the delayed onset of\r\ndefendant's sincerity and acted within its discretion in\r\ndenying a reduction.  \r\n          2.   The adjustment for defendant's role in the\r\noffense was amply supported by the uncontested description of\r\nhis activities in initiating and executing the scheme and in\r\nrecruiting its participants.  \r\n          3.   We perceive no abuse of discretion in the\r\ndistrict court's decision that the federal sentence should be\r\nonly partially concurrent with the prior state sentence.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
