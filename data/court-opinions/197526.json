Gagnon, United States Attorney, and Peter E. Papps, First\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                          \r\n\n                        August 29, 1997\r\n                                          \r\r\n\n          TORRUELLA,  Chief  Judge. Defendant-appellant Kevin\r\n\nWhiffen (\"Whiffen\") was tried and convicted on four counts of\r\n\ntransmitting threatening communications in interstate commerce in\r\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. S 875(c). Whiffen now appeals, arguing that\r\n\nthe indictment failed to allege an offense, that the court should\r\n\nhave granted his motion under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of\r\n\nCriminal Procedure for a judgment of acquittal on all counts, and\r\n\nthat the court erred in its jury instructions. We affirm.\r\n\n                         I. Background\r\n\n          In 1993, Whiffen, a resident of New Hampshire, was\r\n\ndriving a car that was involved in a two-vehicle accident in Rhode\r\n\nIsland. The other car was insured by Allstate Insurance\r\n\n(\"Allstate\"). Allstate paid a claim to its insured and sought\r\n\nreimbursement from Whiffen in the amount of approximately $11,000.\r\n\nThe claim was eventually turned over to Universal Fidelity\r\n\nCorporation (\"UFC\"), located in Florida, for collection. On\r\n\nOctober 11, 1995, UFC sent a letter to Whiffen, informing him that\r\n\nthe New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles had been notified of\r\n\nhis failure to pay and warning that if he failed to pay the claim\r\n\nwithin thirty days, he risked losing his license.\r\n\n          On October 17, 1995, Whiffen returned a telephone call\r\n\nfrom Kelly Terrell (\"Terrell\"), a UFC collector. During the call,\r\n\nWhiffen was \"very belligerent,\" and when Terrell stated that she\r\n\ncould have Whiffen's license suspended, Whiffen said that \"the\r\n\nbuilding will go boom.\" At that point, Terrell disconnected the\r\n\nline.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          Several minutes later, Whiffen called back. The call was\r\n\ntransferred to Terrell, and Whiffen told her that \"the building\r\n\nwill go boom.\"\r\n\n          Whiffen called back a third time, speaking on this\r\n\noccasion with Anna Walls (\"Walls\") of UFC. He asked that a message\r\n\nbe relayed to Terrell that \"buildings go boom boom.\"\r\n\n          On the evening of October 17, 1995, Walls' supervisor,\r\n\nMark Gallo (\"Gallo\"), called Whiffen to confirm the name of his\r\n\nattorney and to ask him to pay his bill. Gallo asked Whiffen if he\r\n\nintended to drive to Florida and blow up the building. Whiffen\r\n\nresponded that he had friends in Florida who would \"take care of it\r\n\nfor him.\"\r\n\n          As a result of Whiffen's statements, UFC closed their\r\n\nfile on Whiffen and returned the account to Allstate. On\r\n\nOctober 29, 1995, Whiffen telephoned Allstate's Bedford, New\r\n\nHampshire office. The call was automatically transferred to Sheryl\r\n\nJohnson, a manager at Allstate's St. Petersburg, Florida office.\r\n\nWhiffen told her that \"Allstate had better stop messing with me or\r\n\nelse I'm going to blow up their building.\"\r\n\n                    II. The Requisite Intent\r\n\n          Although Whiffen makes several claims on appeal, all of\r\n\nthem turn on the question of whether the threats made by Whiffen\r\n\nconstitute threats to the person of another. In order to resolve\r\n\nthis question, we must determine the intent necessary for\r\n\nconviction under section 875.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          The centerpiece of Whiffen's appeal is the claim that 18\r\n\nU.S.C. S 875(c) is a specific intent crime. In other words, in\r\n\norder to obtain a conviction, the government must prove that the\r\n\ndefendant intended his communication to be received as a threat.\r\n\nIn support of this view, Whiffen cites \r                                                United States\r                                                              v. \r                                                                 Twine, 853\r\n\nF.2d 676 (9th Cir. 1988). In  Twine, the Ninth Circuit concluded\r\n\nthat \"the showing of an intent to threaten, required by S 875(c)\r\n\n. . . is a showing of specific intent.\"  Id. at 680.\r\n\n          Other circuits, however, disagree with \r                                                          Twine. In  United\r\n\nStates v. \r                   DeAndino, 958 F.2d 146 (6th Cir. 1992), for example, the\r\n\nSixth Circuit concluded that \"S 875(c) does not require specific\r\n\nintent in regard to the threat element of the offense, but only\r\n\ngeneral intent.\"  Id. at 150. Under a general intent standard,\r\n\nwhether a communication is a \"true threat\" is determined\r\n\nobjectively from all the surrounding facts and circumstances,\r\n\nrather than from the defendant's subjective purpose. A general\r\n\nintent standard has also been adopted by three other circuits. \r                                                                        See\r\n\nUnited \r                 States v. Myers, 104 F.3d 76, 81 (5th Cir. 1997),   United\r\n\nStates v. Himelwright, 42 F.2d 777, 782-83 (3d Cir. 1994), United\r\n\nStates v. Darby, 37 F.3d 1059, 1063-66 (4th Cir. 1994),     cert.\r\n\ndenied, 514 U.S. 1097 (1995). The test espoused in these cases is\r\n\nstated in Darby:\r\n\n Even within the Ninth Circuit there is some question about the\r\ncontinuing validity of Twine.  See United \r                                                    States v. King, 920 F.\r\nSupp. 1978, 1079-80 (C.D. Cal. 1996) (suggesting that       Twine\r\nconflicts with both prior and subsequent Ninth Circuit precedent).\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n            [T]o establish a violation of section\r\n            875(c), the government must establish that\r\n            the defendant intended to transmit the\r\n            interstate communication and that the\r\n            communication contained a true threat.\r\n            Whether a communication in fact contains a\r\n            true threat is determined by the\r\n            interpretation of a reasonable recipient\r\n            familiar with the context of the\r\n            communication. The government does not\r\n            have to prove that the defendant\r\n            subjectively intended for this recipient\r\n            to understand the communication as a\r\n            threat.\r\n\nDarby, 37 F.3d at 1066. Our sister circuits have also considered\r\n\nwhat constitutes a \"true threat\" under other federal threat\r\n\nstatutes.  See United \r                                States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1491 (1st\r\n\nCir. 1997) (collecting cases).\r\n\n          Although the intent requirement of section 875(c) has not\r\n\npreviously been decided by this court, we recently had occasion to\r\n\ndetermine the requisite intent under a different threat statute, 18\r\n\nU.S.C. S 115(a)(1)(B), which criminalizes threats directed at\r\n\nfederal agents.\r\n\n          In determining what constitutes a \"true threat,\" the\r\n\nFulmer panel found the governing standard to be \"whether [the\r\n\ndefendant] should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he\r\n\nuttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it is made.\"\r\n\nFulmer, 108 F.3d at 1491. This test takes into consideration the\r\n\ncontext in which the remark was made and avoids the risk that an\r\n\notherwise innocuous statement might become a threat if directed at\r\n\nan unusually sensitive listener. This approach also protects\r\n\nlisteners from statements that are reasonably interpreted as\r\n\nthreats, even if the speaker lacks the subjective, specific intent\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nto threaten, or, as would be more common, the government is unable\r\n\nto prove such specific intent which, by its nature, is difficult to\r\n\ndemonstrate. \r\n\n          For these reasons, we believe that the logic of Fulmer,\r\n\nwhich considered 18 U.S.C. S 115(a)(1)(B), applies with full force\r\n\nto 18 U.S.C. S 875, and we adopt the same standard for the latter\r\n\nstatute. In doing so, we are also aligning ourselves with the\r\n\nmajority view of our sister circuits, as discussed supra. Having\r\n\nestablished that section 875(c) requires only a general intent, we\r\n\nare able to engage each of Whiffen's specific claims.\r\n\n               III. Failure to Allege an Offense\r\n\n          Whiffen's first claim of error relates to his pre-trial\r\n\nmotion, under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal\r\n\nProcedure, to dismiss the indictment for failure to allege an\r\n\noffense. Whiffen was charged with violation of 18 U.S.C. S 875(c)\r\n\nwhich prohibits the transmission in interstate commerce of \"any\r\n\nthreat to injure the person of another.\" The indictment alleges\r\n\nthat Whiffen made such a communication when he stated that \"[y]our\r\n\nbuilding will go boom\"; \"the building will go boom\"; \"buildings go\r\n\nboom\"; and \"Allstate had better stop messing with me or else I'm\r\n\ngoing to blow up their building.\"\r\n\n          On appeal, Whiffen argues that his motion to dismiss\r\n\nshould have been granted on the grounds that the indictment \"fails\r\n\nto allege 'unequivocal, unconditional and specific expressions of\r\n\nintention immediately to inflict injury' to another person.\" Brief\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nof Appellant at 7 (quoting \r                                    United States\r                                                  v. \r                                                     Kelner, 534 F.2d 1020,\r\n\n1027 (2d Cir. 1976)).\r\n\n          Having determined that specific intent is not the\r\n\nstandard under which Whiffen's statements should be judged, it is\r\n\nclear that the failure to allege specific intent is not grounds for\r\n\ndismissal. \"[A]n indictment is sufficiently particular if it\r\n\nelucidates the elements of a crime, enlightens a defendant as to\r\n\nthe nature of the charges against which she must defend, and\r\n\nenables her to plead double jeopardy in bar of future prosecutions\r\n\nfor the same offense.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161,\r\n\n1192 (1st Cir. 1993); \r                               see also\r                                        Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). Although\r\n\nthe four counts contain slightly different wording, we present only\r\n\nCount I, which is representative of the other counts. Count I\r\n\nstates that:\r\n\n            On or about October 17, 1995, in the\r\n            District of New Hampshire, the defendant,\r\n            Kevin Whiffen knowingly and willfully\r\n            transmitted in interstate commerce between\r\n            Farmington, New Hampshire and Tampa,\r\n            Florida, a communication containing a\r\n            threat to injure Kelly Terrell and other\r\n            employees of Universal Fidelity\r\n            Corporation, Tampa, Florida, to wit, \"Your\r\n            building will go boom.\" All in violation\r\n            of Title 18, United States Code, Section\r\n            875(c).\r\n\nIt is our view that the indictment states the offense for which\r\n\nWhiffen has been convicted. The elements of the crime are\r\n\nelucidated and the indictment is sufficient to plead double\r\n\njeopardy should future prosecutions be brought against Whiffen for\r\n\nthe same offense. The indictment basically tracks the language of\r\n\nsection 875(c), which states: \"Whoever transmits in interstate or\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nforeign commerce any communication containing . . . any threat to\r\n\ninjure the person of another, shall be fined under this title and\r\n\nimprisoned for not more than five years, or both.\" 18 U.S.C.\r\n\nS 875(c). We find the indictment to be sufficient.  See \r                                                                  Darby, 37\r\n\nF.3d at 1063.\r\n\n          Appellant also argues that the indictment is inadequate\r\n\nbecause it \"alleges threats that a building or buildings would 'go\r\n\nboom.' . . . It does not allege that any person would be present\r\n\nor hurt by any such explosion.\" Brief of Appellant at 6. The\r\n\nindictment does, however, allege that each of the threats was a\r\n\nthreat to injure the person of another. In Count I, for example,\r\n\nit is stated that the communication contained \"a threat to injure\r\n\nKelly Terrell and other employees of Universal Fidelity\r\n\nCorporation.\" Whiffen's argument appears to be that threats to\r\n\nblow up the building are, as a matter of law, not threats against\r\n\na person. Like the district court, we are unwilling to conclude\r\n\nthat his words did not contain a threat to injure a person. One\r\n\npossible interpretation of a threat to blow up a building is that\r\n\nthe building will be blown up with people inside. Such an\r\n\ninterpretation would lead to the conclusion that the threat was a\r\n\nthreat against those who work in the building. Alternatively, such\r\n\na threat may be interpreted as a threat to blow up the building\r\n\nonly when it is empty. Under this interpretation, Whiffen's\r\n\nstatement would not constitute a threat against a person. The\r\n\nproper interpretation of Whiffen's remarks, however, is a question\r\n\nof fact and, therefore, appropriately left for the jury. We cannot\r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\nconclude that the interpretation preferred by Whiffen is, as a\r\n\nmatter of law, the correct one.\r\n\n          Whiffen argues that we must interpret section 875(c)\r\n\nnarrowly in order to avoid violation of his First Amendment rights.\r\n\nIn support, he cites Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705 (1969),\r\n\nin which the defendant was accused of threatening the President.\r\n\nThe primary concern of the Court in  Watts was the protection of\r\n\nconstitutionally protected political speech.  See id. at 706-08.\r\n\nWhiffen does not claim that his statements were a form of political\r\n\nspeech.\r\n\n          In any event, a true threat is not protected by the First\r\n\nAmendment.  See  Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1492-93;   United \r                                                                 States v.\r\n\nOrozco-Santillan, 903 F.2d 1262, 1265 (9th Cir. 1990). For this\r\n\nreason, a conviction upon a finding that the statements were true\r\n\nthreats would not violate Whiffen's constitutionally protected\r\n\nright to speech.\r\n\n                   IV.  Judgment of Acquittal\r\n\n          Whiffen also appeals the denial of his motion, under Rule\r\n\n29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for a judgment of\r\n\nacquittal on all counts. We review the district court's ruling\r\n\ndeferentially, considering the evidence \"in the light most\r\n\ncompatible with the verdict, resolv[ing] all credibility disputes\r\n\nin the verdict's favor, and then reach[ing] a judgment about\r\n\nwhether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable\r\n\ndoubt.\" United States\r                                v. \r                                   Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 974 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          Whiffen claims that even under this deferential standard,\r\n\nthe evidence \"failed to prove a true threat to injure 'the person\r\n\nof another.'\" Brief of Appellant at 8. This argument is,\r\n\nultimately, a claim that the words spoken -- on which there is no\r\n\ndispute -- did not constitute a true threat. Specifically, Whiffen\r\n\nargues that \"any reasonable person familiar with the context of\r\n\nthose statements could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that they\r\n\nwere true threats under S 875(c). They were frustrated,\r\n\ninarticulate, and empty words.\" Brief of Appellant at 10.\r\n\n          There is no dispute that Whiffen made the statements,\r\n\nthere is disagreement only with respect to their proper\r\n\ninterpretation. Whether or not Whiffen's statements were true\r\n\nthreats is determined by applying the \r                                               Fulmer test discussed above.\r\n\nAt trial, the government presented testimony that Terrell notified\r\n\ntwo supervisors about Whiffen's call, and informed Stacie Thompson,\r\n\nthe person responsible for incoming mail, to \"be very careful with\r\n\nany packages coming in from this area because there was a bomb\r\n\nthreat.\" Tr., April 9, 1996, at 41. Both Terrell and Walls\r\n\ntestified that this was the only bomb threat they had ever received\r\n\nwhile working in claims collection. Walls, who has fifteen years\r\n\nexperience in third party collections, testified that by Whiffen's\r\n\nthird call she was afraid. Joseph Suozzo, a claim manager in\r\n\nAllstate's Bedford, New Hampshire office, testified that, in\r\n\nreaction to the phone calls from Whiffen, a security guard was\r\n\nhired for the Bedford office and the claim against Whiffen was not\r\n\npursued. This evidence regarding the reaction of the listeners is\r\n\n                              -10-\r\r\n\nnot conclusive, but it does suggest that at least these individuals\r\n\nperceived the statements to be threats.\r\n\n          Faced with this evidence, as well as the content of the\r\n\nstatements and other contextual information, a reasonable jury\r\n\ncould have found that the defendant should have reasonably foreseen\r\n\nthat the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those\r\n\nto whom it was made. For that reason, we affirm the denial of\r\n\nWhiffen's motion for judgments of acquittal on all counts.\r\n\n          With respect to count four, Whiffen argues that he was\r\n\nunaware that his in-state call was re-routed to Florida. His lack\r\n\nof knowledge, however, does not constitute a defense. \"[W]hile the\r\n\nGovernment was required to prove that [the defendant]'s phone call\r\n\ncrossed a state line (a fact not in dispute here), the Government\r\n\ndid not need to prove that [the defendant] knew of the interstate\r\n\nnexus.\"  Darby, 37 F.3d at 1067.\r\n\n                      V. Jury Instructions\r\n\n          Finally, Whiffen challenges the jury instructions. He\r\n\nclaims error in the district court's failure to instruct the jury\r\n\nthat violation of section 875(c) is a specific intent crime. In\r\n\nour discussion of this issue, \r                                       supra section II, we determined that\r\n\nsection 875(c) is a general intent crime. The failure to provide\r\n\ninstructions to the effect that it is a specific intent crime,\r\n\ntherefore, cannot be error.\r\n\n          Whiffen makes the additional argument that the jury\r\n\ninstructions failed to meet the requirements of Fulmer. We turn,\r\n\ntherefore, to consider whether the requirements set forth in that\r\n\n                              -11-\r\r\n\nopinion, which we have determined apply in this case, were\r\n\nsatisfied by the district court.\r\n\n          Fulmer instructs that \"the appropriate standard under\r\n\nwhich a defendant may be convicted for making a threat is whether\r\n\nhe should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered\r\n\nwould be taken as a threat by those to whom it is made.\"  Fulmer,\r\n\n108 F.3d at 1491.\r\n\n          The jury instructions actually given in the instant case\r\n\nwere:\r\n\n            To sustain its burden with regard to the\r\n            second element the government must prove\r\n            beyond a reasonable doubt that the\r\n            communication contained a threat. A\r\n            threat is a serious statement or\r\n            communication expressing an intention to\r\n            inflict bodily injury upon another person\r\n            which, under the surrounding\r\n            circumstances, and in context, would cause\r\n            apprehension in a reasonable person that\r\n            the person making the threat will act on\r\n            it. A criminal threat must be\r\n            distinguished from words used as mere idle\r\n            or careless talk, hyperbole, exaggeration,\r\n            or something said in a joking manner.\r\n            Those are not threats within the meaning\r\n            of the statute involved in this case. In\r\n            other words, the communication must be\r\n            unconditional and a true threat or one\r\n            properly perceived by a reasonable person\r\n            as a real or genuine threat to injure\r\n            another. The government has the burden of\r\n            proving beyond a reasonable doubt that an\r\n            ordinary reasonable person, familiar with\r\n            the context and circumstances surrounding\r\n            the communication, would interpret the\r\n            communication as a genuine threat to\r\n            injure another person. . . . The\r\n            government is not required to prove that\r\n            the defendant subjectively intended the\r\n            recipient to understand the communication\r\n            was a threat, nor need to prove that the\r\n            defendant intended to or was actually able\r\n            to carry out the threat made. [T]he\r\n\n                              -12-\r\r\n\n            government must prove that the threat was\r\n            an unequivocal and unconditional\r\n            expression of intent to cause bodily\r\n            injury to another person and would cause a\r\n            reasonable person in the recipient's\r\n            circumstances to fear that he, she or\r\n            another person faced an imminent risk of\r\n            bodily injury.\r\n\nTr. 9/5/96, at 14-15.\r\n\n          Comparing the instructions given to those required under\r\n\nthe Fulmer analysis, we see that the district court instructions\r\n\nfailed to inform the jury that it must consider whether the\r\n\ndefendant could reasonably have foreseen that the statement would\r\n\nbe taken as a threat. The instructions given indicate that it is\r\n\nsufficient if the communication would cause apprehension in a\r\n\nreasonable listener. In light of     Fulmer, this focus on the\r\n\nrecipient of the threat rather than the defendant could be viewed\r\n\nas error, although we note in fairness to the district court that\r\n\nFulmer was decided some months after the trial in this case. In\r\n\nany event, in this case, as in many others, the distinction is\r\n\nwithout practical importance.\r\n\n          We do not reverse a conviction based on an error in the\r\n\njury instructions if \"it is highly probable that the error did not\r\n\ncontribute to the verdict.\" United States\r                                                   v. \r                                                      Cudlitz, 72 F.3d 992,\r\n\n999 (1st Cir. 1996). An error that is certain to have had no\r\n\nsignificant impact on the jury is harmless.\r\n\n          The facts of this case are such that the instructions\r\n\nrequired under Fulmer and the instructions actually given in this\r\n\ncase are functionally equivalent. In certain situations, as in\r\n\nFulmer, there may be information known to the listener, but not to\r\n\n                              -13-\r\r\n\nthe speaker (or vice versa), that would cause a reasonable listener\r\n\nto perceive a statement as an expression of an intent to injure\r\n\ndespite the fact that a reasonable speaker would not view it as\r\n\nsuch. That is not the case here. It is not possible that the\r\n\nwords spoken by Whiffen were reasonably understood by the employees\r\n\nof UFC and Allstate as an expression of an intent to injure, and\r\n\nyet such an outcome would not have been foreseen by a reasonable\r\n\nspeaker in Whiffen's position. This is so because, unlike in\r\n\nFulmer, Whiffen did not employ language that held a different\r\n\nmeaning for him than it did for the listeners.\r\n\n          We conclude, therefore, that the imperfection in the jury\r\n\ninstructions could not have affected the verdict. The error was\r\n\nharmless.\r\n\n                         VI. Conclusion\r\n\n          For the reasons stated herein, we \r                                                     affirm \r                                                            the judgment of\r\n\nthe district court.\r\n\n                              -14-\r\n",

Whiffen now appeals, arguing that the indictment failed to allege an offense, that the court should have granted his motion under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for a judgment of acquittal on all counts, and that the court erred in its jury instructions.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Whiffen, a resident of New Hampshire, was driving a car that was involved in a two-vehicle accident in Rhode Island.  The other car was insured by Allstate Insurance (\"Allstate\").  Allstate paid a claim to its insured and sought reimbursement from Whiffen in the amount of approximately $11,000.  The claim was eventually turned over to Universal Fidelity Corporation (\"UFC\"), located in Florida, for collection.  On October 11, 1995, UFC sent a letter to Whiffen, informing him that the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles had been notified of his failure to pay and warning that if he failed to pay the claim within thirty days, he risked losing his license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, 1995, Whiffen returned a telephone call from Kelly Terrell (\"Terrell\"), a UFC collector.  During the call, Whiffen was \"very belligerent,\" and when Terrell stated that she could have Whiffen's license suspended, Whiffen said that \"the building will go boom.\"   At that point, Terrell disconnected the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several minutes later, Whiffen called back.  The call was transferred to Terrell, and Whiffen told her that \"the building will go boom.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen called back a third time, speaking on this occasion with Anna Walls (\"Walls\") of UFC.  He asked that a message be relayed to Terrell that \"buildings go boom boom.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of October 17, 1995, Walls' supervisor, Mark Gallo (\"Gallo\"), called Whiffen to confirm the name of his attorney and to ask him to pay his bill.  Gallo asked Whiffen if he intended to drive to Florida and blow up the building.  Whiffen responded that he had friends in Florida who would \"take care of it for him.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of Whiffen's statements, UFC closed their file on Whiffen and returned the account to Allstate.  On October 29, 1995, Whiffen telephoned Allstate's Bedford, New Hampshire office.  The call was automatically transferred to Sheryl Johnson, a manager at Allstate's St. Petersburg, Florida office.  Whiffen told her that \"Allstate had better stop messing with me or else I'm going to blow up their building.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Requisite Intent</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Whiffen makes several claims on appeal, all of them turn on the question of whether the threats made by Whiffen constitute threats to the person of another.  In order to resolve this question, we must determine the intent necessary for conviction under section 875.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The centerpiece of Whiffen's appeal is the claim that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(c) is a specific intent crime.  In other words, in order to obtain a conviction, the government must prove that the defendant intended his communication to be received as a threat.  In support of this view, Whiffen cites United States v. Twine, 853 F.2d 676 (9th Cir.1988).  In Twine, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \"the showing of an intent to threaten, required by &#167; 875(c) ... is a showing of specific intent.\"  Id. at 680.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits, however, disagree with Twine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In United States v. DeAndino, 958 F.2d 146 (6th Cir.1992), for example, the Sixth Circuit concluded that \" &#167; 875(c) does not require specific intent in regard to the threat element of the offense, but only general intent.\"  Id. at 150.   Under a general intent standard, whether a communication is a \"true threat\" is determined objectively from all the surrounding facts and circumstances, rather than from the defendant's subjective purpose.  A general intent standard has also been adopted by three other circuits.  See United States v. Myers, 104 F.3d 76, 81 (5th Cir.1997), United States v. Himelwright, 42 F.3d 777, 782-83 (3d Cir.1994), United States v. Darby, 37 F.3d 1059, 1063-66 (4th Cir.1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1097, 115 S.Ct. 1826, 131 L.Ed.2d 747 (1995).  The test espoused in these cases is stated in Darby:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[T]o establish a violation of section 875(c), the government must establish that the defendant intended to transmit the interstate communication and that the communication contained a true threat.  Whether a communication in fact contains a true threat is determined by the interpretation of a reasonable recipient familiar with the context of the communication.  The government does not have to prove that the defendant subjectively intended for this recipient to understand the communication as a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Darby, 37 F.3d at 1066.   Our sister circuits have also considered what constitutes a \"true threat\" under other federal threat statutes.  See United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1491 (1st Cir.1997) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the intent requirement of section 875(c) has not previously been decided by this court, we recently had occasion to determine the requisite intent under a different threat statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 115(a)(1)(B), which criminalizes threats directed at federal agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining what constitutes a \"true threat,\" the Fulmer panel found the governing standard to be \"whether [the defendant] should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it is made.\"  Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1491.   This test takes into consideration the context in which the remark was made and avoids the risk that an otherwise innocuous statement might become a threat if directed at an unusually sensitive listener.  This approach also protects listeners from statements that are reasonably interpreted as threats, even if the speaker lacks the subjective, specific intent to threaten, or, as would be more common, the government is unable to prove such specific intent which, by its nature, is difficult to demonstrate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we believe that the logic of Fulmer, which considered 18 U.S.C. &#167; 115(a)(1)(B), applies with full force to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875, and we adopt the same standard for the latter statute.  In doing so, we are also aligning ourselves with the majority view of our sister circuits, as discussed supra.   Having established that section 875(c) requires only a general intent, we are able to engage each of Whiffen's specific claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Failure to Allege an Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen's first claim of error relates to his pre-trial motion, under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to dismiss the indictment for failure to allege an offense.  Whiffen was charged with violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(c) which prohibits the transmission in interstate commerce of \"any threat to injure the person of another.\"   The indictment alleges that Whiffen made such a communication when he stated that \"[y]our building will go boom\";  \"the building will go boom\";  \"buildings go boom\";  and \"Allstate had better stop messing with me or else I'm going to blow up their building.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Whiffen argues that his motion to dismiss should have been granted on the grounds that the indictment \"fails to allege 'unequivocal, unconditional and specific expressions of intention immediately to inflict injury' to another person.\"   Brief of Appellant at 7 (quoting United States v. Kelner, 534 F.2d 1020, 1027 (2d Cir.1976)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that specific intent is not the standard under which Whiffen's statements should be judged, it is clear that the failure to allege specific intent is not grounds for dismissal.  \"[A]n indictment is sufficiently particular if it elucidates the elements of a crime, enlightens a defendant as to the nature of the charges against which she must defend, and enables her to plead double jeopardy in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1192 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(1).  Although the four counts contain slightly different wording, we present only Count I, which is representative of the other counts.  Count I states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>On or about October 17, 1995, in the District of New Hampshire, the defendant, Kevin Whiffen knowingly and willfully transmitted in interstate commerce between Farmington, New Hampshire and Tampa, Florida, a communication containing a threat to injure Kelly Terrell and other employees of Universal Fidelity Corporation, Tampa, Florida, to wit, \"Your building will go boom.\"   All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 875(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is our view that the indictment states the offense for which Whiffen has been convicted.  The elements of the crime are elucidated and the indictment is sufficient to plead double jeopardy should future prosecutions be brought against Whiffen for the same offense.  The indictment basically tracks the language of section 875(c), which states:  \"Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing ... any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title and imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(c).  We find the indictment to be sufficient.  See Darby, 37 F.3d at 1063.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that the indictment is inadequate because it \"alleges threats that a building or buildings would 'go boom.'  ...  It does not allege that any person would be present or hurt by any such explosion.\"   Brief of Appellant at 6. The indictment does, however, allege that each of the threats was a threat to injure the person of another.  In Count I, for example, it is stated that the communication contained \"a threat to injure Kelly Terrell and other employees of Universal Fidelity Corporation.\"   Whiffen's argument appears to be that threats to blow up the building are, as a matter of law, not threats against a person.  Like the district court, we are unwilling to conclude that his words did not contain a threat to injure a person.  One possible interpretation of a threat to blow up a building is that the building will be blown up with people inside.  Such an interpretation would lead to the conclusion that the threat was a threat against those who work in the building.  Alternatively, such a threat may be interpreted as a threat to blow up the building only when it is empty.  Under this interpretation, Whiffen's statement would not constitute a threat against a person.  The proper interpretation of Whiffen's remarks, however, is a question of fact and, therefore, appropriately left for the jury.  We cannot conclude that the interpretation preferred by Whiffen is, as a matter of law, the correct one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen argues that we must interpret section 875(c) narrowly in order to avoid violation of his First Amendment rights.  In support, he cites Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969), in which the defendant was accused of threatening the President.  The primary concern of the Court in Watts was the protection of constitutionally protected political speech.  See id. at 706-08, 89 S.Ct. at 1400-02.   Whiffen does not claim that his statements were a form of political speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, a true threat is not protected by the First Amendment.  See Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1492-93;  United States v. Orozco-Santillan, 903 F.2d 1262, 1265 (9th Cir.1990).  For this reason, a conviction upon a finding that the statements were true threats would not violate Whiffen's constitutionally protected right to speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen also appeals the denial of his motion, under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for a judgment of acquittal on all counts.  We review the district court's ruling deferentially, considering the evidence \"in the light most compatible with the verdict, resolv[ing] all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor, and then reach[ing] a judgment about whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  United States v. Taylor, 54 F.3d 967, 974 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen claims that even under this deferential standard, the evidence \"failed to prove a true threat to injure 'the person of another.' \"   Brief of Appellant at 8. This argument is, ultimately, a claim that the words spoken--on which there is no dispute--did not constitute a true threat.  Specifically, Whiffen argues that \"any reasonable person familiar with the context of those statements could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that they were true threats under &#167; 875(c).  They were frustrated, inarticulate, and empty words.\"   Brief of Appellant at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that Whiffen made the statements, there is disagreement only with respect to their proper interpretation.  Whether or not Whiffen's statements were true threats is determined by applying the Fulmer test discussed above.  At trial, the government presented testimony that Terrell notified two supervisors about Whiffen's call, and informed Stacie Thompson, the person responsible for incoming mail, to \"be very careful with any packages coming in from this area because there was a bomb threat.\"   Tr., April 9, 1996, at 41.  Both Terrell and Walls testified that this was the only bomb threat they had ever received while working in claims collection.  Walls, who has fifteen years experience in third party collections, testified that by Whiffen's third call she was afraid.  Joseph Suozzo, a claim manager in Allstate's Bedford, New Hampshire office, testified that, in reaction to the phone calls from Whiffen, a security guard was hired for the Bedford office and the claim against Whiffen was not pursued.  This evidence regarding the reaction of the listeners is not conclusive, but it does suggest that at least these individuals perceived the statements to be threats.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with this evidence, as well as the content of the statements and other contextual information, a reasonable jury could have found that the defendant should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it was made.  For that reason, we affirm the denial of Whiffen's motion for judgments of acquittal on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to count four, Whiffen argues that he was unaware that his in-state call was re-routed to Florida.  His lack of knowledge, however, does not constitute a defense.  \"[W]hile the Government was required to prove that [the defendant]'s phone call crossed a state line (a fact not in dispute here), the Government did not need to prove that [the defendant] knew of the interstate nexus.\"  Darby, 37 F.3d at 1067.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Whiffen challenges the jury instructions.  He claims error in the district court's failure to instruct the jury that violation of section 875(c) is a specific intent crime.  In our discussion of this issue, supra section II, we determined that section 875(c) is a general intent crime.  The failure to provide instructions to the effect that it is a specific intent crime, therefore, cannot be error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen makes the additional argument that the jury instructions failed to meet the requirements of Fulmer.   We turn, therefore, to consider whether the requirements set forth in that opinion, which we have determined apply in this case, were satisfied by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer instructs that \"the appropriate standard under which a defendant may be convicted for making a threat is whether he should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it is made.\"  Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1491.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury instructions actually given in the instant case were:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>To sustain its burden with regard to the second element the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the communication contained a threat.  A threat is a serious statement or communication expressing an intention to inflict bodily injury upon another person which, under the surrounding circumstances, and in context, would cause apprehension in a reasonable person that the person making the threat will act on it.  A criminal threat must be distinguished from words used as mere idle or careless talk, hyperbole, exaggeration, or something said in a joking manner.  Those are not threats within the meaning of the statute involved in this case.  In other words, the communication must be unconditional and a true threat or one properly perceived by a reasonable person as a real or genuine threat to injure another.  The government has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that an ordinary reasonable person, familiar with the context and circumstances surrounding the communication, would interpret the communication as a genuine threat to injure another person....  The government is not required to prove that the defendant subjectively intended the recipient to understand the communication was a threat, nor need to prove that the defendant intended to or was actually able to carry out the threat made.  [T]he government must prove that the threat was an unequivocal and unconditional expression of intent to cause bodily injury to another person and would cause a reasonable person in the recipient's circumstances to fear that he, she or another person faced an imminent risk of bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. 9/5/96, at 14-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparing the instructions given to those required under the Fulmer analysis, we see that the district court instructions failed to inform the jury that it must consider whether the defendant could reasonably have foreseen that the statement would be taken as a threat.  The instructions given indicate that it is sufficient if the communication would cause apprehension in a reasonable listener.  In light of Fulmer, this focus on the recipient of the threat rather than the defendant could be viewed as error, although we note in fairness to the district court that Fulmer was decided some months after the trial in this case.  In any event, in this case, as in many others, the distinction is without practical importance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not reverse a conviction based on an error in the jury instructions if \"it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\"  United States v. Cudlitz, 72 F.3d 992, 999 (1st Cir.1996).  An error that is certain to have had no significant impact on the jury is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are such that the instructions required under Fulmer and the instructions actually given in this case are functionally equivalent.  In certain situations, as in Fulmer, there may be information known to the listener, but not to the speaker (or vice versa), that would cause a reasonable listener to perceive a statement as an expression of an intent to injure despite the fact that a reasonable speaker would not view it as such.  That is not the case here.  It is not possible that the words spoken by Whiffen were reasonably understood by the employees of UFC and Allstate as an expression of an intent to injure, and yet such an outcome would not have been foreseen by a reasonable speaker in Whiffen's position.  This is so because, unlike in Fulmer, Whiffen did not employ language that held a different meaning for him than it did for the listeners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the imperfection in the jury instructions could not have affected the verdict.  The error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Even within the Ninth Circuit there is some question about the continuing validity of Twine.

Whiffen now appeals, arguing that the indictment failed to allege an offense, that the court should have granted his motion under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for a judgment of acquittal on all counts, and that the court erred in its jury instructions.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1993, Whiffen, a resident of New Hampshire, was driving a car that was involved in a two-vehicle accident in Rhode Island.  The other car was insured by Allstate Insurance (\"Allstate\").  Allstate paid a claim to its insured and sought reimbursement from Whiffen in the amount of approximately $11,000.  The claim was eventually turned over to Universal Fidelity Corporation (\"UFC\"), located in Florida, for collection.  On October 11, 1995, UFC sent a letter to Whiffen, informing him that the New Hampshire Division of Motor Vehicles had been notified of his failure to pay and warning that if he failed to pay the claim within thirty days, he risked losing his license.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 17, 1995, Whiffen returned a telephone call from Kelly Terrell (\"Terrell\"), a UFC collector.  During the call, Whiffen was \"very belligerent,\" and when Terrell stated that she could have Whiffen's license suspended, Whiffen said that \"the building will go boom.\"   At that point, Terrell disconnected the line.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several minutes later, Whiffen called back.  The call was transferred to Terrell, and Whiffen told her that \"the building will go boom.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen called back a third time, speaking on this occasion with Anna Walls (\"Walls\") of UFC.  He asked that a message be relayed to Terrell that \"buildings go boom boom.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of October 17, 1995, Walls' supervisor, Mark Gallo (\"Gallo\"), called Whiffen to confirm the name of his attorney and to ask him to pay his bill.  Gallo asked Whiffen if he intended to drive to Florida and blow up the building.  Whiffen responded that he had friends in Florida who would \"take care of it for him.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of Whiffen's statements, UFC closed their file on Whiffen and returned the account to Allstate.  On October 29, 1995, Whiffen telephoned Allstate's Bedford, New Hampshire office.  The call was automatically transferred to Sheryl Johnson, a manager at Allstate's St. Petersburg, Florida office.  Whiffen told her that \"Allstate had better stop messing with me or else I'm going to blow up their building.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Requisite Intent</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Whiffen makes several claims on appeal, all of them turn on the question of whether the threats made by Whiffen constitute threats to the person of another.  In order to resolve this question, we must determine the intent necessary for conviction under section 875.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The centerpiece of Whiffen's appeal is the claim that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(c) is a specific intent crime.  In other words, in order to obtain a conviction, the government must prove that the defendant intended his communication to be received as a threat.  In support of this view, Whiffen cites United States v. Twine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509633\"><a href=\"/opinion/509633/united-states-v-james-twine/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">676</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1988).  In Twine, the Ninth Circuit concluded that \"the showing of an intent to threaten, required by &#167; 875(c) ... is a showing of specific intent.\"  Id. at 680.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits, however, disagree with Twine.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In United States v. DeAndino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578705\"><a href=\"/opinion/578705/united-states-v-jean-pierre-deandino/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span> (6th Cir.1992), for example, the Sixth Circuit concluded that \" &#167; 875(c) does not require specific intent in regard to the threat element of the offense, but only general intent.\"  Id. at 150.   Under a general intent standard, whether a communication is a \"true threat\" is determined objectively from all the surrounding facts and circumstances, rather than from the defendant's subjective purpose.  A general intent standard has also been adopted by three other circuits.  See United States v. Myers, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"11167\"><a href=\"/opinion/11167/united-states-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span>, 81 (5th Cir.1997), United States v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></span> (1995).  The test espoused in these cases is stated in Darby:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>[T]o establish a violation of section 875(c), the government must establish that the defendant intended to transmit the interstate communication and that the communication contained a true threat.  Whether a communication in fact contains a true threat is determined by the interpretation of a reasonable recipient familiar with the context of the communication.  The government does not have to prove that the defendant subjectively intended for this recipient to understand the communication as a threat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Darby, 37 F.3d at 1066.   Our sister circuits have also considered what constitutes a \"true threat\" under other federal threat statutes.  See United States v. Fulmer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197264\"><a href=\"/opinion/197264/united-states-v-fulmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1486</span></a></span>, 1491 (1st Cir.1997) (collecting cases).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the intent requirement of section 875(c) has not previously been decided by this court, we recently had occasion to determine the requisite intent under a different threat statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 115(a)(1)(B), which criminalizes threats directed at federal agents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining what constitutes a \"true threat,\" the Fulmer panel found the governing standard to be \"whether [the defendant] should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it is made.\"  Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1491.   This test takes into consideration the context in which the remark was made and avoids the risk that an otherwise innocuous statement might become a threat if directed at an unusually sensitive listener.  This approach also protects listeners from statements that are reasonably interpreted as threats, even if the speaker lacks the subjective, specific intent to threaten, or, as would be more common, the government is unable to prove such specific intent which, by its nature, is difficult to demonstrate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we believe that the logic of Fulmer, which considered 18 U.S.C. &#167; 115(a)(1)(B), applies with full force to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875, and we adopt the same standard for the latter statute.  In doing so, we are also aligning ourselves with the majority view of our sister circuits, as discussed supra.   Having established that section 875(c) requires only a general intent, we are able to engage each of Whiffen's specific claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Failure to Allege an Offense</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen's first claim of error relates to his pre-trial motion, under Rule 12(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to dismiss the indictment for failure to allege an offense.  Whiffen was charged with violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(c) which prohibits the transmission in interstate commerce of \"any threat to injure the person of another.\"   The indictment alleges that Whiffen made such a communication when he stated that \"[y]our building will go boom\";  \"the building will go boom\";  \"buildings go boom\";  and \"Allstate had better stop messing with me or else I'm going to blow up their building.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Whiffen argues that his motion to dismiss should have been granted on the grounds that the indictment \"fails to allege 'unequivocal, unconditional and specific expressions of intention immediately to inflict injury' to another person.\"   Brief of Appellant at 7 (quoting United States v. Kelner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"335138\"><a href=\"/opinion/335138/united-states-v-russell-kelner/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1020</span></a></span>, 1027 (2d Cir.1976)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that specific intent is not the standard under which Whiffen's statements should be judged, it is clear that the failure to allege specific intent is not grounds for dismissal.  \"[A]n indictment is sufficiently particular if it elucidates the elements of a crime, enlightens a defendant as to the nature of the charges against which she must defend, and enables her to plead double jeopardy in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.\"  United States v. Sepulveda, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662432\"><a href=\"/opinion/662432/united-states-v-david-sepulveda-united-states-of-america-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1161</span></a></span>, 1192 (1st Cir.1993);  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(1).  Although the four counts contain slightly different wording, we present only Count I, which is representative of the other counts.  Count I states that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>On or about October 17, 1995, in the District of New Hampshire, the defendant, Kevin Whiffen knowingly and willfully transmitted in interstate commerce between Farmington, New Hampshire and Tampa, Florida, a communication containing a threat to injure Kelly Terrell and other employees of Universal Fidelity Corporation, Tampa, Florida, to wit, \"Your building will go boom.\"   All in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 875(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is our view that the indictment states the offense for which Whiffen has been convicted.  The elements of the crime are elucidated and the indictment is sufficient to plead double jeopardy should future prosecutions be brought against Whiffen for the same offense.  The indictment basically tracks the language of section 875(c), which states:  \"Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing ... any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title and imprisoned for not more than five years, or both.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 875(c).  We find the indictment to be sufficient.  See Darby, 37 F.3d at 1063.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that the indictment is inadequate because it \"alleges threats that a building or buildings would 'go boom.'  ...  It does not allege that any person would be present or hurt by any such explosion.\"   Brief of Appellant at 6. The indictment does, however, allege that each of the threats was a threat to injure the person of another.  In Count I, for example, it is stated that the communication contained \"a threat to injure Kelly Terrell and other employees of Universal Fidelity Corporation.\"   Whiffen's argument appears to be that threats to blow up the building are, as a matter of law, not threats against a person.  Like the district court, we are unwilling to conclude that his words did not contain a threat to injure a person.  One possible interpretation of a threat to blow up a building is that the building will be blown up with people inside.  Such an interpretation would lead to the conclusion that the threat was a threat against those who work in the building.  Alternatively, such a threat may be interpreted as a threat to blow up the building only when it is empty.  Under this interpretation, Whiffen's statement would not constitute a threat against a person.  The proper interpretation of Whiffen's remarks, however, is a question of fact and, therefore, appropriately left for the jury.  We cannot conclude that the interpretation preferred by Whiffen is, as a matter of law, the correct one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen argues that we must interpret section 875(c) narrowly in order to avoid violation of his First Amendment rights.  In support, he cites Watts v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107904\"><a href=\"/opinion/107904/watts-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">394</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107904\"><a href=\"/opinion/107904/watts-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span> (1969), in which the defendant was accused of threatening the President.  The primary concern of the Court in Watts was the protection of constitutionally protected political speech.  See id. at 706-08, 89 S.Ct. at 1400-02.   Whiffen does not claim that his statements were a form of political speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, a true threat is not protected by the First Amendment.  See Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1492-93;  United States v. Orozco-Santillan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542010\"><a href=\"/opinion/542010/united-states-v-alfredo-orozco-santillan/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1262</span></a></span>, 1265 (9th Cir.1990).  For this reason, a conviction upon a finding that the statements were true threats would not violate Whiffen's constitutionally protected right to speech.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Judgment of Acquittal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen also appeals the denial of his motion, under Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for a judgment of acquittal on all counts.  We review the district court's ruling deferentially, considering the evidence \"in the light most compatible with the verdict, resolv[ing] all credibility disputes in the verdict's favor, and then reach[ing] a judgment about whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  United States v. Taylor, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 974 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen claims that even under this deferential standard, the evidence \"failed to prove a true threat to injure 'the person of another.' \"   Brief of Appellant at 8. This argument is, ultimately, a claim that the words spoken--on which there is no dispute--did not constitute a true threat.  Specifically, Whiffen argues that \"any reasonable person familiar with the context of those statements could not find beyond a reasonable doubt that they were true threats under &#167; 875(c).  They were frustrated, inarticulate, and empty words.\"   Brief of Appellant at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no dispute that Whiffen made the statements, there is disagreement only with respect to their proper interpretation.  Whether or not Whiffen's statements were true threats is determined by applying the Fulmer test discussed above.  At trial, the government presented testimony that Terrell notified two supervisors about Whiffen's call, and informed Stacie Thompson, the person responsible for incoming mail, to \"be very careful with any packages coming in from this area because there was a bomb threat.\"   Tr., April 9, 1996, at 41.  Both Terrell and Walls testified that this was the only bomb threat they had ever received while working in claims collection.  Walls, who has fifteen years experience in third party collections, testified that by Whiffen's third call she was afraid.  Joseph Suozzo, a claim manager in Allstate's Bedford, New Hampshire office, testified that, in reaction to the phone calls from Whiffen, a security guard was hired for the Bedford office and the claim against Whiffen was not pursued.  This evidence regarding the reaction of the listeners is not conclusive, but it does suggest that at least these individuals perceived the statements to be threats.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with this evidence, as well as the content of the statements and other contextual information, a reasonable jury could have found that the defendant should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it was made.  For that reason, we affirm the denial of Whiffen's motion for judgments of acquittal on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to count four, Whiffen argues that he was unaware that his in-state call was re-routed to Florida.  His lack of knowledge, however, does not constitute a defense.  \"[W]hile the Government was required to prove that [the defendant]'s phone call crossed a state line (a fact not in dispute here), the Government did not need to prove that [the defendant] knew of the interstate nexus.\"  Darby, 37 F.3d at 1067.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Whiffen challenges the jury instructions.  He claims error in the district court's failure to instruct the jury that violation of section 875(c) is a specific intent crime.  In our discussion of this issue, supra section II, we determined that section 875(c) is a general intent crime.  The failure to provide instructions to the effect that it is a specific intent crime, therefore, cannot be error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whiffen makes the additional argument that the jury instructions failed to meet the requirements of Fulmer.   We turn, therefore, to consider whether the requirements set forth in that opinion, which we have determined apply in this case, were satisfied by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fulmer instructs that \"the appropriate standard under which a defendant may be convicted for making a threat is whether he should have reasonably foreseen that the statement he uttered would be taken as a threat by those to whom it is made.\"  Fulmer, 108 F.3d at 1491.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury instructions actually given in the instant case were:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>To sustain its burden with regard to the second element the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the communication contained a threat.  A threat is a serious statement or communication expressing an intention to inflict bodily injury upon another person which, under the surrounding circumstances, and in context, would cause apprehension in a reasonable person that the person making the threat will act on it.  A criminal threat must be distinguished from words used as mere idle or careless talk, hyperbole, exaggeration, or something said in a joking manner.  Those are not threats within the meaning of the statute involved in this case.  In other words, the communication must be unconditional and a true threat or one properly perceived by a reasonable person as a real or genuine threat to injure another.  The government has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that an ordinary reasonable person, familiar with the context and circumstances surrounding the communication, would interpret the communication as a genuine threat to injure another person....  The government is not required to prove that the defendant subjectively intended the recipient to understand the communication was a threat, nor need to prove that the defendant intended to or was actually able to carry out the threat made.  [T]he government must prove that the threat was an unequivocal and unconditional expression of intent to cause bodily injury to another person and would cause a reasonable person in the recipient's circumstances to fear that he, she or another person faced an imminent risk of bodily injury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr. 9/5/96, at 14-15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Comparing the instructions given to those required under the Fulmer analysis, we see that the district court instructions failed to inform the jury that it must consider whether the defendant could reasonably have foreseen that the statement would be taken as a threat.  The instructions given indicate that it is sufficient if the communication would cause apprehension in a reasonable listener.  In light of Fulmer, this focus on the recipient of the threat rather than the defendant could be viewed as error, although we note in fairness to the district court that Fulmer was decided some months after the trial in this case.  In any event, in this case, as in many others, the distinction is without practical importance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not reverse a conviction based on an error in the jury instructions if \"it is highly probable that the error did not contribute to the verdict.\"  United States v. Cudlitz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196509\"><a href=\"/opinion/196509/united-states-v-cudlitz/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, 999 (1st Cir.1996).  An error that is certain to have had no significant impact on the jury is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts of this case are such that the instructions required under Fulmer and the instructions actually given in this case are functionally equivalent.  In certain situations, as in Fulmer, there may be information known to the listener, but not to the speaker (or vice versa), that would cause a reasonable listener to perceive a statement as an expression of an intent to injure despite the fact that a reasonable speaker would not view it as such.  That is not the case here.  It is not possible that the words spoken by Whiffen were reasonably understood by the employees of UFC and Allstate as an expression of an intent to injure, and yet such an outcome would not have been foreseen by a reasonable speaker in Whiffen's position.  This is so because, unlike in Fulmer, Whiffen did not employ language that held a different meaning for him than it did for the listeners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude, therefore, that the imperfection in the jury instructions could not have affected the verdict.  The error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Even within the Ninth Circuit there is some question about the continuing validity of Twine.   See United States v. King, 920 F.Supp.1078, 1079-80 (C.D.Cal.1996) (suggesting that Twine conflicts with both prior and subsequent Ninth Circuit precedent)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
