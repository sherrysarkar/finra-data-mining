Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n        Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nMark G. Furey for CVS Pharmacy, et al.\r\nAndru H. Volinsky for Provencher.\r\n\nMay 26, 1998\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  These appeals arise out of\r\nRichard Provencher's federal claims against CVS Pharmacy (CVS) of\r\nsexual harassment and retaliation and Deborah Banaian's state\r\ncounterclaims for false arrest and imprisonment, intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress, and defamation.  A jury found CVS\r\nretaliated against Provencher for filing a sexual harassment claim,\r\nand declined to find defamation.  CVS appeals the jury instruction\r\non retaliation and the punitive damages award.  Banaian appeals the\r\ndismissal of her first two counterclaims; in turn, Provencher\r\nappeals the dismissal of his sexual harassment claim.  We affirm\r\nthe district court in all respects.\r\n          I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL OVERVIEW\r\nProvencher was employed by CVS from July 1988 until his\r\ntermination in May 1995.  He worked as Banaian's assistant manager\r\nfrom late 1989 until April 1992, when he was promoted to manager of\r\nanother CVS store.  At the time CVS fired him, he managed a CVS\r\nstore in Manchester, New Hampshire.  \r\nThe core of Provencher's case was that he was sexually\r\nharassed by Banaian because he was a gay man and ultimately fired\r\nby CVS because he reported the harassment.  Provencher alleged that\r\nRandy Ellis, his supervisor in 1989, directed Banaian to harass\r\nhim, with the goal of leading him to resign.  Rather than quit, \r\nProvencher reported the harassment to company officials, who took\r\nno remedial action.  In 1995, he filed a sexual harassment\r\ncomplaint with the New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights. \r\nAround that same period, he served on a jury, which he reflected on\r\nhis CVS time sheet as a forty hour work week of jury service. \r\nShortly thereafter, he was terminated by CVS, allegedly for\r\nfalsifying payroll records during this period.  Provencher\r\nclaimed, and the jury agreed, that he was discharged in retaliation\r\nfor filing a sexual harassment claim.\r\nThe central tenets of the defense were:  Ellis did not know\r\nProvencher was gay until late 1993 and therefore could not have\r\nacted as alleged; CVS did not pursue remedial action because\r\nProvencher specifically directed it not to do so; and, finally,\r\nProvencher was terminated for violating company policy.  Banaian's\r\ncounterclaims arise from her allegation that Provencher improperly\r\nhad police remove her from the store he managed, thereby\r\nembarrassing and humiliating her in front of co-workers.\r\nAs no insufficiency of the evidence claim has been raised, we\r\nare not concerned with the adequacy of the jury's findings of fact,\r\nbut rather with the legal decisions made by the judge.  We address\r\nfirst CVS' contentions that the district court erred in the nature\r\nof the instructions given and the damages imposed.  We then examine\r\nthe dismissal of the counterclaims of intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress and false arrest and imprisonment.  Finally, we\r\nturn to Provencher's sexual harassment hostile work environment\r\nclaim to review its dismissal on summary judgment.\r\n              II.  THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThe parties agree that at all times during the litigation CVS\r\nmaintained that Provencher was fired for falsifying payroll\r\nrecords, and Provencher alleged the termination amounted to\r\nretaliatory discharge.  CVS argues on appeal that the jury could\r\nhave found that both reasons contributed to the termination, and\r\nit was error to use the language \"played a part\" and \"a motivating\r\nfactor\" in the retaliation instruction.  According to CVS, where a\r\ndiscriminatory motive can be one of multiple factors resulting in\r\ndischarge, the jury should be instructed that liability attaches\r\nonly where the impermissible motive is a \"determinative,\"\r\n\"dominant\" or \"substantial\" factor in the employer's decision.  \r\nBefore examining the adequacy of the instruction, we consider\r\nwhether, as Provencher claims, CVS failed to raise its challenge\r\nbelow.  If it did not object, we review for plain error.  SeeCambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d 752, 767 (1st Cir.\r\n1996).  Plain error applies only where the error results in a clear\r\nmiscarriage of justice or seriously affects the fairness, integrity\r\nor public reputation of the proceedings.  See id.  The record shows\r\nthat CVS objected generally to the instruction given, and\r\nspecifically requested the court to describe the prohibited\r\nmotivation as \"substantial,\" \"principal,\" \"dominant,\" or some other\r\nlanguage conveying that the jury could not find liability if the\r\ndiscriminatory motive was de minimus.  While better practice would\r\nhave been to object to the specific language it now contests --\r\n\"played a part\" and \"a motivating factor\" -- CVS' objection did go\r\nto the heart of its current argument, namely, that the jury might\r\nbelieve it could impose liability even where the discriminatory\r\nmotive was small and the permissible motive large.   \r\nFinding therefore that CVS sufficiently raised the issue\r\nbelow, we examine the jury instructions de novo to determine if,\r\ntaken as a whole, they confused or misled the jury on the\r\napplicable law.  See Tatro v. Kervin, 41 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  We will not reverse a judgment if we determine that the\r\ninstruction, examined in this light, is harmless.  See Davet v.\r\nMaccarone, 973 F.2d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\nBecause we must examine the jury instruction on retaliation as\r\na whole, we repeat in full that portion concerning causation:\r\n[U]nder Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer to\r\ndiscriminate against any employee because that employee\r\nhas opposed what he or she believed to have been sex\r\ndiscrimination by an employer, or because the employee\r\nfiled a charge of sex discrimination. . . .\r\n. . . .   \r\nIt is not necessary for Mr. Provencher to prove that a\r\nretaliatory motive was the sole motivation of, or even a\r\nprimary motivation for, the defendant's decision to\r\nterminate him.  The plaintiff need only prove that it\r\nplayed a part in the decision even though other factors\r\nmay have motivated the defendant.  Once Mr. Provencher\r\nshows that a retaliatory motive was a motivating factor\r\nin the defendant's decision, it is the defendant's burden\r\nto articulate a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its\r\ndecision to terminate him.  If the defendant does so, Mr.\r\nProvencher must prove by a preponderance of the evidence\r\nthat the proffered legitimate reason is in fact a pretext\r\nand that retaliation was a motivating factor in the\r\ndefendant's decision.  Mr. Provencher retains the\r\nultimate burden of persuading you by a preponderance of\r\nthe evidence that he was retaliated against as he claims.\r\nMr. Provencher claims that the defendant's reasons for\r\nterminating him are not the true reasons why he was\r\nterminated, that such reasons are unworthy of belief, and\r\nthat the true reason for his termination was that he\r\nopposed an employment practice or practices he reasonably\r\nbelieved to have been sexually discriminatory, and/or\r\nthat he filed a charge of employment discrimination with\r\nthe commission.  When you consider Mr. Provencher's\r\nevidence that the reason advanced by the defendant is a\r\npretext, keep in mind that the relevant question is\r\nwhether or not the defendant's reason was the real reason\r\nfor its actions. . . .  An employer is entitled to make\r\nan employment decision for a good reason, a bad reason,\r\nor for no reason at all, so long as the decision is not\r\nmotivated by unlawful retaliation.  However, you may\r\nconsider whether the defendant's reason is merely a\r\ncover-up for unlawful retaliation.\r\n\nIn McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and\r\nagain in Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248\r\n(1981) (to which we refer generally as McDonnell Douglas/Burdine),\r\nthe Supreme Court set forth the standard to be applied in cases\r\nwhere either a legitimate or an illegitimate motive applies. \r\nAlthough appellants argue for some adjusted standard, they offer no\r\nsupporting authority for this proposition.  As both parties\r\nconsistently argued at trial that the jury had one of two factual\r\nversions to believe -- fabrication violative of company policy or\r\nretaliation -- we apply the McDonnell Douglas/Burdine standard to\r\nthis case.\r\nThe plaintiff must first prove, by a preponderance of the\r\nevidence, a prima facie case of retaliation.  See Burdine, 450 U.S.\r\nat 253 (defining the standard in a sex discrimination case).  If\r\nthe plaintiff succeeds, the defendant has a burden of production to\r\narticulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its\r\nchallenged actions.  See id. at 254-55.  Then, by a preponderance\r\nof the evidence, the plaintiff must show that the proffered reason\r\nis pretextual.  See id. at 256.  At all times, however, the\r\nplaintiff retains the ultimate burden to show that he has been the\r\nvictim of intentional discrimination.  See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.\r\nHicks, 509 U.S. 502, 507 (1993) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253). \r\n In this case, the district court accurately stated that, in\r\norder to impose liability, the jury had to find that the adverse\r\naction was taken because Provencher filed a sex discrimination\r\ncharge.  The court correctly defined the applicable standard of\r\nproof, explained that the jury must determine whether CVS'\r\nproffered reason was pretextual, and instructed that liability\r\ncould be imposed if it determined that retaliation was the \"real\"\r\nand \"true\" reason for the employment decision.  \r\nThe district court, however, also used the problematic\r\nlanguage, \"a motivating factor\" and \"played a part,\" instead of\r\nmaking it clear that liability should be imposed only if\r\ndiscrimination was the determinative factor.  See Kelley v.\r\nAirborne Freight Corp., No. 96-2057, 1998 WL 150958, at *12 (1st\r\nCir. Apr. 7, 1998).  But this is not dispositive.  In Brown v.\r\nTrustees of Boston Univ., 891 F.2d 337, 353 (1st Cir. 1989), the\r\ncourt upheld an instruction, given in a McDonnell Douglas/Burdinediscrimination case, stating, amid otherwise appropriate language, \r\n[The] universit[y] ha[s] the right to exercise\r\nindependent judgment in choosing faculty and its decision\r\nmust be respected unless tainted by . . . illegal reasons\r\ncited by the plaintiff. . . . The university . . . can\r\nmake any kind of mistake except a decision that is\r\ntainted by sex discrimination or retaliation . . . and\r\nyour disagreement in general terms is not a basis for a\r\nfinding for the plaintiff unless you find that the\r\ndecision was effectively tainted by . . . illegal\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\nAcknowledging that \"taint\" indicated an incorrect standard, the\r\ncourt found that, given the instructions as a whole,  its use did\r\nnot confuse the jury.  See id. at 354 (explaining, \"[t]he 'taint'\r\nremarks were . . . sandwiched between several statements which\r\naccurately defined the meaning of the words 'because of' . . . and\r\nseveral statements that [the impermissible motive] must be the\r\n'true' or 'real' reason for discrimination\").  \r\nSimilarly, the district court in this case instructed the jury\r\nto find the \"true\" or \"real\" reasons for the termination, and\r\nclearly placed the burden upon Provencher to prove that he was\r\nfired because he filed a sexual harassment claim.  We think it\r\nclear to the jury, given the instructions as a whole and the\r\nargument at trial, that liability could exist only if the jury\r\ncredited Provencher's position that retaliation was the reason\r\nbehind his discharge, but not if retaliation was a mere factor\r\namong many.   \r\n           III.  THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD\r\nWe review the district court's award of punitive damages de\r\nnovo, as we review for legal error.  See Compagnie De Reassurance\r\nD'Ile de France v. New England Reinsurance Corp., 57 F.3d 56, 71\r\n(1st Cir. 1995).  The jury awarded Provencher $8,000 in punitive\r\ndamages for the retaliation, but awarded no compensatory damages. \r\nBased on the jury's finding of liability, the district court\r\nawarded Provencher back pay of $8,423 for 1995 and $1,201 for 1996,\r\nwith interest, and front pay of $141,221; it then entered judgment\r\nfor these amounts and for $8,000 punitive damages in accordance\r\nwith the jury's verdict.  \r\nCVS appeals the punitive damages award, relying on Kerr-Selgasv. American Airlines, Inc., 69 F.3d 1205 (1st Cir. 1995).  There,\r\nthe plaintiff received compensatory damages on her state law claim\r\nbut not on her federal claim, and was awarded punitive damages on\r\nthe federal claim alone.  See id. at 1214.  We held that, under \r\n1981a, punitive damages could not be awarded in the absence of\r\ncompensatory or nominal damages.  See id. at 1215.\r\nThis general proposition does not resolve the issue on appeal,\r\nhowever, because Kerr-Selgas is distinguishable from the present\r\ncase on a critical fact -- the award of back pay.  The district\r\ncourt based its punitive damage award to Provencher on its\r\nconcomitant award of back pay.  By contrast, the punitive damages\r\ndecision Kerr-Selgas did not rest in any way on the issuance of\r\nback pay or any other remedy which was compensatory in function. \r\nThis is a decisive difference.\r\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 (the Act) made available\r\ncompensatory and punitive damages in Title VII cases.  See 42\r\nU.S.C.  1981a.  The Supreme Court characterized this as a marked\r\nchange in the conception of the injury redressable by Title VII. \r\nSee United States v. Burke, 112 S. Ct. 1867, 1874 n.12 (1992). \r\nSubsection (b) of the Act provides that a punitive damages award is\r\nproper in a case where the plaintiff is injured and the\r\ndiscriminatory act is perpetrated with malice or reckless\r\nindifference.  The Act, however, does not limit an award of\r\npunitive damages to cases in which compensatory relief is given.\r\nIn Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., 69 F.3d 1344,\r\n1352 (7th Cir. 1995), the Seventh Circuit awarded the plaintiff\r\npunitive damages and back pay, in the absence of a compensatory\r\ndamages award, reasoning that no federal law placed restrictions on\r\nsuch an award and common law restrictions were inapplicable.  The\r\nSeventh Circuit first distinguished the different approaches to\r\nback pay under common law and under Title VII.  Under common law,\r\nupon which Kerr-Selgas relied, punitive damages are prohibited in\r\nthe absence of compensatory damages, but the latter include back\r\npay.  See id.  By contrast, compensatory damages under  1981a omit\r\nback pay.  See id.  This omission occurred to prevent double\r\nrecovery, as Title VII already provided for back pay; the exclusion\r\nwas not the result of viewing a back pay award as fundamentally\r\ndistinct from compensatory damages.  See id. (citing Landgraf v.\r\nUSI Film Prod., 511 U.S. 244, 253 (1994)).  The Seventh Circuit\r\nthen considered the essential nature of back pay.  Traditionally\r\nviewed as an equitable remedy imposed by the judge, back pay\r\nreflects an injury of lost wages to the plaintiff.  See Landgraf,\r\n511 U.S. at 252-53.  As such, it is a \"'makewhole' remedy that\r\nresembles compensatory damages in some respects\" and is \"the most\r\nobvious economic damage in a wrongful discharge case.\"  Id.(citations omitted).  The Seventh Circuit concluded that, because\r\nTitle VII placed no prohibition upon punitive damages in the\r\nabsence of compensatory damages, and because, in redressing an\r\ninjury suffered by the plaintiff, back pay awards serve a similar\r\npurpose as compensatory damages awards, a punitive damages award\r\nwas proper.  See Hennessy, 69 F.3d at 1352.  We agree with the\r\nSeventh Circuit's thoughtful analysis.\r\nHere, too, the district court's award to Provencher of back\r\npay was based on injury he suffered as a result of retaliatory\r\ndischarge by CVS.  We see no reason to allow punitive damages only\r\nwhere the jury enters an award for compensatory damages and not\r\nwhere the judge enters an award for back pay, given that injury to\r\nthe plaintiff is redressed in both instances.  We therefore uphold\r\nthe punitive damages award.\r\n                IV.  THE COUNTERCLAIMS\r\nIn order to review adequately the dismissal of the false\r\narrest and imprisonment, and the intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress claims, we review briefly the evidence presented\r\nby Banaian.  In 1994 and 1995, Banaian shopped on occasion at the\r\nManchester CVS store managed by Provencher because it was close to\r\nher house.  On March 12, 1995, she was shopping there, without\r\naddressing or looking at Provencher, when he swore at her, refused\r\nto allow her to retrieve her prescription, and then called the\r\npolice to remove her from the store.  Two officers arrived and when\r\nProvencher (incorrectly) told them that Banaian was barred from his\r\nstore, they asked her to leave, which she did after deciding that\r\nany resistance would be futile.  On the basis of this incident, she\r\nbrought claims of false arrest and imprisonment, defamation and\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress against Provencher. \r\nAt the close of the case, the district court dismissed the false\r\narrest and imprisonment claim, and directed Banaian to elect\r\nbetween her intentional infliction of emotional distress and\r\ndefamation claims, allowing her to proceed upon only one of these\r\ntheories.  Banaian now appeals the forced election and consequent\r\ndismissal of the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim\r\nand the dismissal of the false arrest and imprisonment claim.\r\nFalse imprisonment, also referred to as false arrest under New\r\nHampshire law, Hickox v. J.B. Morin Agency, Inc., 110 N.H. 438,\r\n441, 272 A.2d 321, 323 (1970), is defined as \"the knowing\r\nconfinement of another unlawfully . . . so as to interfere\r\nsubstantially with his physical movement.\"  State v. Fecteau, 121\r\nN.H. 1003, 1007, 437 A.2d 294, 296 (1981) (citations omitted). \r\nBanaian concedes that the police simply asked her to leave, without\r\nthreatening arrest, and she complied, without any verbal or\r\nphysical resistance.  We therefore agree with the district court\r\nthat Banaian presented insufficient evidence of unlawful restraint\r\nto proceed on her false arrest and imprisonment claim.\r\nIn addition, we find that the intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress claim, set forth in the counterclaim as resting\r\nupon statements supporting defamation and \"conduct . . . in falsely\r\narresting and imprisoning\" Banaian, properly did not proceed before\r\nthe jury.  In the absence of the dismissed false arrest and\r\nimprisonment claim, the remaining allegations were identical to\r\nthose supporting defamation.  As such, the standard articulated in\r\nDeMeo v. Goodall, 640 F. Supp. 1115, 1116 (D. N.H. 1986), applies,\r\nnamely, \"New Hampshire law does not recognize a cause of action for\r\nwrongful infliction of emotional distress where the factual\r\npredicate sounds in defamation.\"\r\n           V.  THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM\r\nProvencher's claim of sexual harassment was premised on a\r\nhostile work environment theory covering his employment as\r\nBanaian's assistant manager, her contact with him after he became\r\nmanager of other CVS branches, and CVS' failure to address his\r\nsexual harassment complaints.  At the close of plaintiff's case,\r\nthe district court granted defendant's motion for judgment as a\r\nmatter of law, dismissing the claim on statute of limitations\r\ngrounds and rejecting Provencher's argument that otherwise time-\r\nbarred acts were rendered timely under a continuing violation\r\ntheory of sexual harassment.  We review this decision de novo.  SeeSchultz v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat. Bank, N.A., 94 F.3d 721,\r\n726 (1st Cir. 1996).  We will reverse if we determine that a\r\nreasonable jury could have found in his favor.  See id. \r\nSexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination\r\nprohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  42 U.S.C.\r\n2000e-2(a)(1) (prohibiting an employer from failing or refusing\r\nto hire, discharging, or otherwise discriminating against any\r\nindividual on compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\r\nemployment, because of the employee's sex); see Meritor Sav. Bank,\r\nFSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65-67 (1986) (holding that a claim of\r\nhostile work environment sexual harassment is a form of sexual\r\ndiscrimination actionable under Title VII).  A plaintiff can\r\nprevail on a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim only\r\nif he establishes that the harassment was sufficiently severe or\r\npervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create a\r\nhostile work environment.  See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., 510\r\nU.S. 17, 21 (1993).\r\nTo assess the dismissal of Provencher's hostile work\r\nenvironment claim, we review briefly his evidence of sexual\r\nharassment.  In 1989, his district manager suggested he receive\r\ncounseling for his homosexuality and then transferred him to work\r\nas Banaian's assistant manager; from this time until April 1992,\r\nBanaian called him \"fag\" and \"queer,\" said she would make him \"a\r\nreal man,\" fondled herself and disrobed in his presence, and\r\ntouched his genital area, among other inappropriate conduct.  Also\r\nduring this period, he was denied a pay raise.  Sometime in late\r\n1992 or early 1993, after he no longer worked for Banaian, she\r\ntelephoned him, saying that she missed him and had no one with whom\r\nshe could play or \"change clothes.\"  In late 1993, he took a\r\nstress-related leave of absence, resulting in large part from\r\nBanaian's conduct.  In 1994, Banaian began shopping at the\r\nManchester store he managed, and toward the end of the year, came\r\nin often, on occasion up to three times a day.  In March 1995,\r\nProvencher received a telephone call at work from someone he\r\nsuspected to be Banaian's husband, threatening to spill his \"AIDS\r\nblood\" all over the parking lot.  Two days later, Banaian came to\r\nhis store and, after she refused to leave, he called the police,\r\nwho escorted her from the store.  Finally, over the course of his\r\nemployment with CVS and as early as 1992, Provencher reported the\r\nconduct of Banaian and Ellis to appropriate CVS personnel, but the\r\ncompany did not investigate and took no remedial action.  These\r\nfacts, taken together, form the basis of Provencher's claim that he\r\nwas subjected to a hostile work environment.\r\nTitle VII requires that an employment discrimination charge\r\nthat is first filed with the appropriate state agency, as here, be\r\nfiled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 300\r\ndays of the alleged discrimination.  See 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e). \r\nThe parties agree that, because Provencher did not file until\r\nJanuary 11, 1995, acts pre-dating March 18, 1994, are outside the\r\nstandard statute of limitations period.  Provencher argues,\r\nhowever, that he may reach back to include these otherwise untimely\r\nacts in his charge because he was subjected to a \"continuing\r\nviolation\" of sexual harassment.  \r\nThe continuing violation doctrine creates an equitable\r\nexception to the 300-day limitation when the unlawful behavior is\r\ndeemed ongoing.  See, e.g., Lawton v. State Mut. Life Assurance Co.\r\nof Am., 101 F.3d 218, 221 (1st Cir. 1996); Sabree v. United Bhd. of\r\nCarpenters and Joiners Local No. 33, 921 F.2d 396, 400-02 (1st Cir.\r\n1990); Jensen v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 522 (1st Cir. 1990).  A\r\ncontinuing violation allows a plaintiff not only to allege\r\notherwise time-barred acts, but more concretely, to receive\r\ndamages, such as back pay, based on and reaching back to those\r\nacts.  See DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 307-08 (1st Cir.\r\n1997) (citations omitted).  \r\nContinuing violations may be serial or systemic.  See Pilgrimv. Trustees of Tufts College, 118 F.3d 864, 869 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nProvencher argues that his claim could fall in either category.  We\r\nthink not.  \"A systemic violation has its roots in a discriminatory\r\npolicy or practice; so long as the policy or practice itself\r\ncontinues into the limitations period, a challenger may be deemed\r\nto have filed a timely complaint.\"  Sabree, 921 F.2d at 400 n.7\r\n(citing Jensen, 912 F.2d at 523).  This type of claim requires no\r\nidentifiable act of discrimination in the limitations period,\r\nMuniz-Cabrero v. Ruiz, 23 F.3d 607, 610 (1st Cir. 1994), and refers\r\nto general practices or policies, such as hiring, promotion,\r\ntraining and compensation.  See, e.g., Mack v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac.\r\nTea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 183 (1st Cir. 1989) (alleging a\r\ndiscriminatory promotional system); Rich v. Martin Marietta, 522\r\nF.2d 333, 348 (10th Cir. 1975) (entire promotional system\r\nchallenged as resulting in plaintiffs' staying in lower echelons\r\ninterminably); Barbara Lindemann &amp; Paul Grossman, Employment\r\nDiscrimination Law 1355-59 (3d ed. 1996).    \r\nIn Muniz-Cabrero, we found that the plaintiff's systemic\r\ncontinuing violation  1983 claim for discrimination based on\r\npolitical affiliation failed because the plaintiff did not produce\r\ncomparative evidence indicating that he was treated differently\r\nfrom persons in other political groups.  23 F.3d at 611.  As in\r\nMuniz-Cabrero, Provencher's claim essentially centers on CVS'\r\ndiscriminatory behavior toward him, with no comparative evidence of\r\na policy or practice by CVS that results in discrimination against\r\ngay men generally.  Because evidence of verbal and physical\r\nharassment, overall decreased salary, and the company's failure to\r\nremedy indicate acts intended to harm and humiliate Provencher\r\nonly, and do not show a policy or practice by the company, see id.,\r\nhis claim is most appropriately framed as a serial violation.\r\nA serial violation occurs where a chain of similar\r\ndiscriminatory acts emanating from the same discriminatory animus\r\nexists and where there has been some violation within the statute\r\nof limitations period that anchors the earlier claims.  SeeDeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 307.  Discrimination cases may involve acts\r\nthat amount to unlawful discrimination upon their repetition or\r\nescalation.  See, e.g., Galloway v. General Motors Serv. Parts\r\nOperations, 78 F.3d 1164, 1166 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"In its early\r\nstages [acts] may not be diagnosable as sex discrimination . . . ,\r\nor may not cause sufficient distress . . ., or may not have gone on\r\nlong enough to charge the employer with knowledge and a negligent\r\nfailure to take effective remedial measures.\").  It therefore makes\r\nmost sense to view the anchor violation requirement as demanding\r\nthat the plaintiff prove a timely act forming part of and exposing\r\na pattern of actionable sexual harassment.  Merely residual effects\r\nof past discriminatory conduct, however, are not themselves acts of\r\ndiscrimination and therefore will not satisfy the anchor violation\r\nrequirement.  See DeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 309.    \r\nEven where a plaintiff alleges a violation within the\r\nappropriate statute of limitations period, the continuing violation\r\nclaim will fail if the plaintiff was or should have been aware that\r\nhe was being unlawfully discriminated against while the earlier\r\nacts, now untimely, were taking place.  See Sabree, 921 F.2d at\r\n401-02.  We begin our analysis here, as Provencher has failed to\r\nmeet this critical notice standard.\r\nIn Sabree, we rejected the plaintiff's continuing violation\r\nclaim because the plaintiff admitted that he believed, at every\r\nturn, that he was being discriminated against.  We reasoned that a\r\nknowing plaintiff has an obligation to file promptly or lose his\r\nclaim: \"[t]his can be distinguished from a plaintiff who is unable\r\nto appreciate that he is being discriminated against until he has\r\nlived through a series of acts and is thereby able to perceive the\r\noverall discriminatory pattern.\"  Id.; see also Jensen, 912 F.2d at\r\n522 (\"What matters is whether, when and to what extent the\r\nplaintiff was on inquiry notice.\"); Rush v. Scott Specialty Gases,\r\nInc., 113 F.3d 476, 481-82 (3d Cir. 1997) (failure to claim sexual\r\nharassment earlier does not destroy the plaintiff's continuing\r\nviolation claim because the evidence shows that the harassment\r\nintensified and plaintiff did not realize until later the severity\r\nof the sexual harassment). \r\nThis revelatory standard reflects the rationale of the\r\ncontinuing violation doctrine.  \"[T]he purpose . . . is to permit\r\nthe inclusion of acts whose character as discriminatory acts was\r\nnot apparent at the time they occurred.\"  Speer v. Rand McNally &amp;\r\nCo., 123 F.3d 658, 663 (7th Cir. 1997) (quoting Doe v. R. R.\r\nDonnelley &amp; Sons Co., 42 F.3d 439, 446 (7th Cir. 1994)); see alsoGalloway, 78 F.3d at 1166 (plaintiffs must be encouraged to\r\ncommence litigation when they become aware of conduct that would\r\nsupport a viable claim without forcing them to do so prematurely);\r\nWest v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., 45 F.3d 744, 754 (3d Cir. 1995)\r\n(explaining that exceptions to the standard filing time serve to\r\naccommodate indeterminate situations that cannot be measured in\r\nfull as they occur).  As Provencher admits that he knew he was\r\nbeing harassed long before he brought his sexual harassment suit,\r\nand certainly had this knowledge before the statute of limitations\r\nperiod had run, his continuing violation claim cannot stand.\r\nIt also fails because Provencher has not demonstrated that the\r\ntimely acts are linked to the untimely acts by similarity,\r\nrepetition or continuity.  See Galloway, 78 F.3d at 1166 (\"Acts of\r\nsexual harassment so discrete in time or circumstances that they do\r\nnot reinforce each other cannot reasonably be linked together into\r\na single chain, a single course of conduct, to defeat the statute\r\nof limitations.\")  Where these characteristics are not met, the\r\nalleged anchor violation cannot serve as a \"continuation\" of the\r\npast allegedly discriminatory behavior.  See, e.g., Lawton, 101\r\nF.3d at 221 (firing insufficient to meet timely violation\r\nrequirement of a serial continuing violation, as \"[c]ommon sense\r\nteaches that a plaintiff cannot resuscitate time-barred acts, said\r\nto be discriminatory, by the simple expedient of linking them to a\r\nnon-identical, non-discriminatory, non-time-barred act\"); Kassayev. Bryant College, 999 F.2d 603, 607 (1st Cir. 1993) (the sole\r\ntimely act, a request that plaintiff vacate his office after his\r\ncontract expired, was not unreasonable on its face given the need\r\nto accommodate other faculty members, and it amounted to a mere\r\neffect of alleged past discrimination, namely denial of tenure);\r\nPurrington v. University of Utah, 996 F.2d 1025, 1028 (10th Cir.\r\n1993) (plaintiff's observance of one act of sexual harassment and\r\nhearing about another such incident one year after the alleged\r\nharassment she personally experienced had ceased were incidents too\r\nsporadic and removed from the plaintiff's workplace to support a\r\ncontinuing violation claim).  \r\nThe untimely acts alleged during Provencher's tenure as\r\nBanaian's assistant manager (ending in April 1992) are extreme in\r\ncharacter, ranging from name calling to physical invasion, and the\r\nother untimely act alleged involved a phone call in which Banaian\r\ntold Provencher she missed him and had no one with whom to change\r\nclothes.  By contrast, the timely acts involve apparently neutral\r\nbehavior (shopping at his store, without inappropriate comment or\r\nmovement), failure to remediate by the company, and a bare,\r\nunsupported suspicion (the telephone call he believes was made by\r\nBanaian's husband).  The timely allegations therefore are too\r\nseparated by character and time to be viewed as a repetition of the\r\nuntimely acts.  \r\nWe are left with determining whether the timely allegations by\r\nthemselves support a claim for sexual harassment.  We find they do\r\nnot.  Failure by CVS to remediate did not exacerbate the harassment\r\nand, although it constitutes improper behavior that could subject\r\nthe company to liability, it is not itself sexual harassment.  SeeSpeer, 123 F.3d at 664 (an employer's refusal to take action is not\r\nitself an act of Title VII discrimination); Burrell v. City Univ.\r\nof New York, 1998 WL 89661, *7 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 1998) (employer's\r\nfailure to remedy harassment goes to establish its liability, but\r\nnot to establish actionable sexual harassment).  Overall reduced\r\npay is an effect of past discrimination and not itself a\r\ndiscriminatory act.  See Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., 110 F.3d\r\n898, 907 (2d Cir. 1997).  The telephone call, by itself and without\r\nsupporting evidence linking it to Banaian, is insufficient.  And,\r\nwhile context is relevant to determining hostile work environment\r\nclaims, we certainly cannot say that shopping at a store, without\r\nmore, is a ground upon which a sexual harassment claim may rest. \r\n\"We accept that many different forms of offensive behavior may be\r\nincluded within the definition of hostile environment sexual\r\nharassment. . . . However, the overtones of such behavior must be,\r\nat the very least, sex-based, so as to be a recognizable form of\r\nsexual harassment.\"  Morrison v. Carleton Woolen Mills, Inc., 108\r\nF.3d 429, 441 (1st Cir. 1997).  Provencher's evidence fails to meet\r\nthis threshold.\r\n                   VI.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court in\r\nall respects.\r\n\nAffirmed.  \n",

Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                 Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n        Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\r\n\nMark G. Furey for CVS Pharmacy, et al.\r\nAndru H. Volinsky for Provencher.\r\n\nMay 26, 1998\r\n\nCOFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge.  These appeals arise out of\r\nRichard Provencher's federal claims against CVS Pharmacy (CVS) of\r\nsexual harassment and retaliation and Deborah Banaian's state\r\ncounterclaims for false arrest and imprisonment, intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress, and defamation.  A jury found CVS\r\nretaliated against Provencher for filing a sexual harassment claim,\r\nand declined to find defamation.  CVS appeals the jury instruction\r\non retaliation and the punitive damages award.  Banaian appeals the\r\ndismissal of her first two counterclaims; in turn, Provencher\r\nappeals the dismissal of his sexual harassment claim.  We affirm\r\nthe district court in all respects.\r\n          I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL OVERVIEW\r\nProvencher was employed by CVS from July 1988 until his\r\ntermination in May 1995.  He worked as Banaian's assistant manager\r\nfrom late 1989 until April 1992, when he was promoted to manager of\r\nanother CVS store.  At the time CVS fired him, he managed a CVS\r\nstore in Manchester, New Hampshire.  \r\nThe core of Provencher's case was that he was sexually\r\nharassed by Banaian because he was a gay man and ultimately fired\r\nby CVS because he reported the harassment.  Provencher alleged that\r\nRandy Ellis, his supervisor in 1989, directed Banaian to harass\r\nhim, with the goal of leading him to resign.  Rather than quit, \r\nProvencher reported the harassment to company officials, who took\r\nno remedial action.  In 1995, he filed a sexual harassment\r\ncomplaint with the New Hampshire Commission for Human Rights. \r\nAround that same period, he served on a jury, which he reflected on\r\nhis CVS time sheet as a forty hour work week of jury service. \r\nShortly thereafter, he was terminated by CVS, allegedly for\r\nfalsifying payroll records during this period.  Provencher\r\nclaimed, and the jury agreed, that he was discharged in retaliation\r\nfor filing a sexual harassment claim.\r\nThe central tenets of the defense were:  Ellis did not know\r\nProvencher was gay until late 1993 and therefore could not have\r\nacted as alleged; CVS did not pursue remedial action because\r\nProvencher specifically directed it not to do so; and, finally,\r\nProvencher was terminated for violating company policy.  Banaian's\r\ncounterclaims arise from her allegation that Provencher improperly\r\nhad police remove her from the store he managed, thereby\r\nembarrassing and humiliating her in front of co-workers.\r\nAs no insufficiency of the evidence claim has been raised, we\r\nare not concerned with the adequacy of the jury's findings of fact,\r\nbut rather with the legal decisions made by the judge.  We address\r\nfirst CVS' contentions that the district court erred in the nature\r\nof the instructions given and the damages imposed.  We then examine\r\nthe dismissal of the counterclaims of intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress and false arrest and imprisonment.  Finally, we\r\nturn to Provencher's sexual harassment hostile work environment\r\nclaim to review its dismissal on summary judgment.\r\n              II.  THE JURY INSTRUCTIONS\r\nThe parties agree that at all times during the litigation CVS\r\nmaintained that Provencher was fired for falsifying payroll\r\nrecords, and Provencher alleged the termination amounted to\r\nretaliatory discharge.  CVS argues on appeal that the jury could\r\nhave found that both reasons contributed to the termination, and\r\nit was error to use the language \"played a part\" and \"a motivating\r\nfactor\" in the retaliation instruction.  According to CVS, where a\r\ndiscriminatory motive can be one of multiple factors resulting in\r\ndischarge, the jury should be instructed that liability attaches\r\nonly where the impermissible motive is a \"determinative,\"\r\n\"dominant\" or \"substantial\" factor in the employer's decision.  \r\nBefore examining the adequacy of the instruction, we consider\r\nwhether, as Provencher claims, CVS failed to raise its challenge\r\nbelow.  If it did not object, we review for plain error.  SeeCambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196794\"><a href=\"/opinion/196794/cambridge-plating-v-napco-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 767 (1st Cir.\r\n1996).  Plain error applies only where the error results in a clear\r\nmiscarriage of justice or seriously affects the fairness, integrity\r\nor public reputation of the proceedings.  See id.  The record shows\r\nthat CVS objected generally to the instruction given, and\r\nspecifically requested the court to describe the prohibited\r\nmotivation as \"substantial,\" \"principal,\" \"dominant,\" or some other\r\nlanguage conveying that the jury could not find liability if the\r\ndiscriminatory motive was de minimus.  While better practice would\r\nhave been to object to the specific language it now contests --\r\n\"played a part\" and \"a motivating factor\" -- CVS' objection did go\r\nto the heart of its current argument, namely, that the jury might\r\nbelieve it could impose liability even where the discriminatory\r\nmotive was small and the permissible motive large.   \r\nFinding therefore that CVS sufficiently raised the issue\r\nbelow, we examine the jury instructions de novo to determine if,\r\ntaken as a whole, they confused or misled the jury on the\r\napplicable law.  See Tatro v. Kervin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195760\"><a href=\"/opinion/195760/tatro-v-kervin/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  We will not reverse a judgment if we determine that the\r\ninstruction, examined in this light, is harmless.  See Davet v.\r\nMaccarone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589645\"><a href=\"/opinion/589645/richard-f-davet-v-enrico-maccarone/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26 (1st Cir. 1992).\r\nBecause we must examine the jury instruction on retaliation as\r\na whole, we repeat in full that portion concerning causation:\r\n[U]nder Title VII, it is unlawful for an employer to\r\ndiscriminate against any employee because that employee\r\nhas opposed what he or she believed to have been sex\r\ndiscrimination by an employer, or because the employee\r\nfiled a charge of sex discrimination. . . .\r\n. . . .   \r\nIt is not necessary for Mr. Provencher to prove that a\r\nretaliatory motive was the sole motivation of, or even a\r\nprimary motivation for, the defendant's decision to\r\nterminate him.  The plaintiff need only prove that it\r\nplayed a part in the decision even though other factors\r\nmay have motivated the defendant.  Once Mr. Provencher\r\nshows that a retaliatory motive was a motivating factor\r\nin the defendant's decision, it is the defendant's burden\r\nto articulate a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its\r\ndecision to terminate him.  If the defendant does so, Mr.\r\nProvencher must prove by a preponderance of the evidence\r\nthat the proffered legitimate reason is in fact a pretext\r\nand that retaliation was a motivating factor in the\r\ndefendant's decision.  Mr. Provencher retains the\r\nultimate burden of persuading you by a preponderance of\r\nthe evidence that he was retaliated against as he claims.\r\nMr. Provencher claims that the defendant's reasons for\r\nterminating him are not the true reasons why he was\r\nterminated, that such reasons are unworthy of belief, and\r\nthat the true reason for his termination was that he\r\nopposed an employment practice or practices he reasonably\r\nbelieved to have been sexually discriminatory, and/or\r\nthat he filed a charge of employment discrimination with\r\nthe commission.  When you consider Mr. Provencher's\r\nevidence that the reason advanced by the defendant is a\r\npretext, keep in mind that the relevant question is\r\nwhether or not the defendant's reason was the real reason\r\nfor its actions. . . .  An employer is entitled to make\r\nan employment decision for a good reason, a bad reason,\r\nor for no reason at all, so long as the decision is not\r\nmotivated by unlawful retaliation.  However, you may\r\nconsider whether the defendant's reason is merely a\r\ncover-up for unlawful retaliation.\r\n\nIn McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973), and\r\nagain in Texas Dep't of Community Affairs v.

As both parties\r\nconsistently argued at trial that the jury had one of two factual\r\nversions to believe -- fabrication violative of company policy or\r\nretaliation -- we apply the McDonnell Douglas/Burdine standard to\r\nthis case.\r\nThe plaintiff must first prove, by a preponderance of the\r\nevidence, a prima facie case of retaliation.  See Burdine, 450 U.S.\r\nat 253 (defining the standard in a sex discrimination case).  If\r\nthe plaintiff succeeds, the defendant has a burden of production to\r\narticulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for its\r\nchallenged actions.  See id. at 254-55.  Then, by a preponderance\r\nof the evidence, the plaintiff must show that the proffered reason\r\nis pretextual.  See id. at 256.  At all times, however, the\r\nplaintiff retains the ultimate burden to show that he has been the\r\nvictim of intentional discrimination.  See St. Mary's Honor Ctr. v.\r\nHicks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112901\"><a href=\"/opinion/112901/st-marys-honor-center-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 507 (1993) (quoting Burdine, 450 U.S. at 253). \r\n In this case, the district court accurately stated that, in\r\norder to impose liability, the jury had to find that the adverse\r\naction was taken because Provencher filed a sex discrimination\r\ncharge.  The court correctly defined the applicable standard of\r\nproof, explained that the jury must determine whether CVS'\r\nproffered reason was pretextual, and instructed that liability\r\ncould be imposed if it determined that retaliation was the \"real\"\r\nand \"true\" reason for the employment decision.  \r\nThe district court, however, also used the problematic\r\nlanguage, \"a motivating factor\" and \"played a part,\" instead of\r\nmaking it clear that liability should be imposed only if\r\ndiscrimination was the determinative factor.  See Kelley v.\r\nAirborne Freight Corp., No. 96-2057, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">150958</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *12 (1st\r\nCir. Apr. 7, 1998).  But this is not dispositive.  In Brown v.\r\nTrustees of Boston Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 353 (1st Cir. 1989), the\r\ncourt upheld an instruction, given in a McDonnell Douglas/Burdinediscrimination case, stating, amid otherwise appropriate language, \r\n[The] universit[y] ha[s] the right to exercise\r\nindependent judgment in choosing faculty and its decision\r\nmust be respected unless tainted by . . . illegal reasons\r\ncited by the plaintiff. . . . The university . . . can\r\nmake any kind of mistake except a decision that is\r\ntainted by sex discrimination or retaliation . . . and\r\nyour disagreement in general terms is not a basis for a\r\nfinding for the plaintiff unless you find that the\r\ndecision was effectively tainted by . . . illegal\r\nconsiderations.\r\n\nAcknowledging that \"taint\" indicated an incorrect standard, the\r\ncourt found that, given the instructions as a whole,  its use did\r\nnot confuse the jury.  See id. at 354 (explaining, \"[t]he 'taint'\r\nremarks were . . . sandwiched between several statements which\r\naccurately defined the meaning of the words 'because of' . . . and\r\nseveral statements that [the impermissible motive] must be the\r\n'true' or 'real' reason for discrimination\").  \r\nSimilarly, the district court in this case instructed the jury\r\nto find the \"true\" or \"real\" reasons for the termination, and\r\nclearly placed the burden upon Provencher to prove that he was\r\nfired because he filed a sexual harassment claim.  We think it\r\nclear to the jury, given the instructions as a whole and the\r\nargument at trial, that liability could exist only if the jury\r\ncredited Provencher's position that retaliation was the reason\r\nbehind his discharge, but not if retaliation was a mere factor\r\namong many.   \r\n           III.  THE PUNITIVE DAMAGES AWARD\r\nWe review the district court's award of punitive damages de\r\nnovo, as we review for legal error.  See Compagnie De Reassurance\r\nD'Ile de France v. New England Reinsurance Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697655\"><a href=\"/opinion/697655/compagnie-de-reassurance-dile-de-france-v-new-england-reinsurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71\r\n(1st Cir. 1995).  The jury awarded Provencher $8,000 in punitive\r\ndamages for the retaliation, but awarded no compensatory damages. \r\nBased on the jury's finding of liability, the district court\r\nawarded Provencher back pay of $8,423 for 1995 and $1,201 for 1996,\r\nwith interest, and front pay of $141,221; it then entered judgment\r\nfor these amounts and for $8,000 punitive damages in accordance\r\nwith the jury's verdict.  \r\nCVS appeals the punitive damages award, relying on Kerr-Selgasv. American Airlines, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707599\"><a href=\"/opinion/707599/69-fair-emplpraccas-bna-944-67-empl-prac-dec-p-43780-mary-jane/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1995).  There,\r\nthe plaintiff received compensatory damages on her state law claim\r\nbut not on her federal claim, and was awarded punitive damages on\r\nthe federal claim alone.  See id. at 1214.  We held that, under \r\n1981a, punitive damages could not be awarded in the absence of\r\ncompensatory or nominal damages.  See id. at 1215.\r\nThis general proposition does not resolve the issue on appeal,\r\nhowever, because Kerr-Selgas is distinguishable from the present\r\ncase on a critical fact -- the award of back pay.  The district\r\ncourt based its punitive damage award to Provencher on its\r\nconcomitant award of back pay.  By contrast, the punitive damages\r\ndecision Kerr-Selgas did not rest in any way on the issuance of\r\nback pay or any other remedy which was compensatory in function. \r\nThis is a decisive difference.\r\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 (the Act) made available\r\ncompensatory and punitive damages in Title VII cases.  See 42\r\nU.S.C.  1981a.  The Supreme Court characterized this as a marked\r\nchange in the conception of the injury redressable by Title VII. \r\nSee United States v. Burke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112737\"><a href=\"/opinion/112737/united-states-v-burke/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1867</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1874 n.12 (1992). \r\nSubsection (b) of the Act provides that a punitive damages award is\r\nproper in a case where the plaintiff is injured and the\r\ndiscriminatory act is perpetrated with malice or reckless\r\nindifference.  The Act, however, does not limit an award of\r\npunitive damages to cases in which compensatory relief is given.\r\nIn Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707611\"><a href=\"/opinion/707611/patricia-hennessy-v-penril-datacomm-networks-incorporated-and-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n1352 (7th Cir. 1995), the Seventh Circuit awarded the plaintiff\r\npunitive damages and back pay, in the absence of a compensatory\r\ndamages award, reasoning that no federal law placed restrictions on\r\nsuch an award and common law restrictions were inapplicable.  The\r\nSeventh Circuit first distinguished the different approaches to\r\nback pay under common law and under Title VII.  Under common law,\r\nupon which Kerr-Selgas relied, punitive damages are prohibited in\r\nthe absence of compensatory damages, but the latter include back\r\npay.  See id.  By contrast, compensatory damages under  1981a omit\r\nback pay.  See id.  This omission occurred to prevent double\r\nrecovery, as Title VII already provided for back pay; the exclusion\r\nwas not the result of viewing a back pay award as fundamentally\r\ndistinct from compensatory damages.  See id. (citing Landgraf v.\r\nUSI Film Prod., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253 (1994)).  The Seventh Circuit\r\nthen considered the essential nature of back pay.  Traditionally\r\nviewed as an equitable remedy imposed by the judge, back pay\r\nreflects an injury of lost wages to the plaintiff.  See Landgraf,\r\n511 U.S. at 252-53.  As such, it is a \"'makewhole' remedy that\r\nresembles compensatory damages in some respects\" and is \"the most\r\nobvious economic damage in a wrongful discharge case.\"  Id.(citations omitted).  The Seventh Circuit concluded that, because\r\nTitle VII placed no prohibition upon punitive damages in the\r\nabsence of compensatory damages, and because, in redressing an\r\ninjury suffered by the plaintiff, back pay awards serve a similar\r\npurpose as compensatory damages awards, a punitive damages award\r\nwas proper.  See Hennessy, 69 F.3d at 1352.  We agree with the\r\nSeventh Circuit's thoughtful analysis.\r\nHere, too, the district court's award to Provencher of back\r\npay was based on injury he suffered as a result of retaliatory\r\ndischarge by CVS.  We see no reason to allow punitive damages only\r\nwhere the jury enters an award for compensatory damages and not\r\nwhere the judge enters an award for back pay, given that injury to\r\nthe plaintiff is redressed in both instances.  We therefore uphold\r\nthe punitive damages award.\r\n                IV.  THE COUNTERCLAIMS\r\nIn order to review adequately the dismissal of the false\r\narrest and imprisonment, and the intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress claims, we review briefly the evidence presented\r\nby Banaian.  In 1994 and 1995, Banaian shopped on occasion at the\r\nManchester CVS store managed by Provencher because it was close to\r\nher house.  On March 12, 1995, she was shopping there, without\r\naddressing or looking at Provencher, when he swore at her, refused\r\nto allow her to retrieve her prescription, and then called the\r\npolice to remove her from the store.  Two officers arrived and when\r\nProvencher (incorrectly) told them that Banaian was barred from his\r\nstore, they asked her to leave, which she did after deciding that\r\nany resistance would be futile.  On the basis of this incident, she\r\nbrought claims of false arrest and imprisonment, defamation and\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress against Provencher. \r\nAt the close of the case, the district court dismissed the false\r\narrest and imprisonment claim, and directed Banaian to elect\r\nbetween her intentional infliction of emotional distress and\r\ndefamation claims, allowing her to proceed upon only one of these\r\ntheories.  Banaian now appeals the forced election and consequent\r\ndismissal of the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim\r\nand the dismissal of the false arrest and imprisonment claim.\r\nFalse imprisonment, also referred to as false arrest under New\r\nHampshire law, Hickox v.

We therefore agree with the district court\r\nthat Banaian presented insufficient evidence of unlawful restraint\r\nto proceed on her false arrest and imprisonment claim.\r\nIn addition, we find that the intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress claim, set forth in the counterclaim as resting\r\nupon statements supporting defamation and \"conduct . . . in falsely\r\narresting and imprisoning\" Banaian, properly did not proceed before\r\nthe jury.  In the absence of the dismissed false arrest and\r\nimprisonment claim, the remaining allegations were identical to\r\nthose supporting defamation.  As such, the standard articulated in\r\nDeMeo v. Goodall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1452443\"><a href=\"/opinion/1452443/demeo-v-goodall/\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

N.H. 1986), applies,\r\nnamely, \"New Hampshire law does not recognize a cause of action for\r\nwrongful infliction of emotional distress where the factual\r\npredicate sounds in defamation.\"\r\n           V.  THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM\r\nProvencher's claim of sexual harassment was premised on a\r\nhostile work environment theory covering his employment as\r\nBanaian's assistant manager, her contact with him after he became\r\nmanager of other CVS branches, and CVS' failure to address his\r\nsexual harassment complaints.  At the close of plaintiff's case,\r\nthe district court granted defendant's motion for judgment as a\r\nmatter of law, dismissing the claim on statute of limitations\r\ngrounds and rejecting Provencher's argument that otherwise time-\r\nbarred acts were rendered timely under a continuing violation\r\ntheory of sexual harassment.  We review this decision de novo.  SeeSchultz v. Rhode Island Hosp. Trust Nat. Bank, N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196938\"><a href=\"/opinion/196938/schultz-v-ri-hosp-trust-nat-bk/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n726 (1st Cir. 1996).

A plaintiff can\r\nprevail on a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim only\r\nif he establishes that the harassment was sufficiently severe or\r\npervasive to alter the conditions of employment and create a\r\nhostile work environment.  See Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21 (1993).\r\nTo assess the dismissal of Provencher's hostile work\r\nenvironment claim, we review briefly his evidence of sexual\r\nharassment.  In 1989, his district manager suggested he receive\r\ncounseling for his homosexuality and then transferred him to work\r\nas Banaian's assistant manager; from this time until April 1992,\r\nBanaian called him \"fag\" and \"queer,\" said she would make him \"a\r\nreal man,\" fondled herself and disrobed in his presence, and\r\ntouched his genital area, among other inappropriate conduct.  Also\r\nduring this period, he was denied a pay raise.  Sometime in late\r\n1992 or early 1993, after he no longer worked for Banaian, she\r\ntelephoned him, saying that she missed him and had no one with whom\r\nshe could play or \"change clothes.\"  In late 1993, he took a\r\nstress-related leave of absence, resulting in large part from\r\nBanaian's conduct.  In 1994, Banaian began shopping at the\r\nManchester store he managed, and toward the end of the year, came\r\nin often, on occasion up to three times a day.  In March 1995,\r\nProvencher received a telephone call at work from someone he\r\nsuspected to be Banaian's husband, threatening to spill his \"AIDS\r\nblood\" all over the parking lot.  Two days later, Banaian came to\r\nhis store and, after she refused to leave, he called the police,\r\nwho escorted her from the store.  Finally, over the course of his\r\nemployment with CVS and as early as 1992, Provencher reported the\r\nconduct of Banaian and Ellis to appropriate CVS personnel, but the\r\ncompany did not investigate and took no remedial action.  These\r\nfacts, taken together, form the basis of Provencher's claim that he\r\nwas subjected to a hostile work environment.\r\nTitle VII requires that an employment discrimination charge\r\nthat is first filed with the appropriate state agency, as here, be\r\nfiled with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 300\r\ndays of the alleged discrimination.  See 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(e). \r\nThe parties agree that, because Provencher did not file until\r\nJanuary 11, 1995, acts pre-dating March 18, 1994, are outside the\r\nstandard statute of limitations period.  Provencher argues,\r\nhowever, that he may reach back to include these otherwise untimely\r\nacts in his charge because he was subjected to a \"continuing\r\nviolation\" of sexual harassment.  \r\nThe continuing violation doctrine creates an equitable\r\nexception to the 300-day limitation when the unlawful behavior is\r\ndeemed ongoing.

A\r\ncontinuing violation allows a plaintiff not only to allege\r\notherwise time-barred acts, but more concretely, to receive\r\ndamages, such as back pay, based on and reaching back to those\r\nacts.

As in\r\nMuniz-Cabrero, Provencher's claim essentially centers on CVS'\r\ndiscriminatory behavior toward him, with no comparative evidence of\r\na policy or practice by CVS that results in discrimination against\r\ngay men generally.  Because evidence of verbal and physical\r\nharassment, overall decreased salary, and the company's failure to\r\nremedy indicate acts intended to harm and humiliate Provencher\r\nonly, and do not show a policy or practice by the company, see id.,\r\nhis claim is most appropriately framed as a serial violation.\r\nA serial violation occurs where a chain of similar\r\ndiscriminatory acts emanating from the same discriminatory animus\r\nexists and where there has been some violation within the statute\r\nof limitations period that anchors the earlier claims.  SeeDeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 307.  Discrimination cases may involve acts\r\nthat amount to unlawful discrimination upon their repetition or\r\nescalation.  See, e.g., Galloway v. General Motors Serv. Parts\r\nOperations, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714831\"><a href=\"/opinion/714831/rochelle-galloway-v-general-motors-service-parts-operations/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1164</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1166 (7th Cir. 1996) (\"In its early\r\nstages [acts] may not be diagnosable as sex discrimination . . . ,\r\nor may not cause sufficient distress . . ., or may not have gone on\r\nlong enough to charge the employer with knowledge and a negligent\r\nfailure to take effective remedial measures.\").  It therefore makes\r\nmost sense to view the anchor violation requirement as demanding\r\nthat the plaintiff prove a timely act forming part of and exposing\r\na pattern of actionable sexual harassment.  Merely residual effects\r\nof past discriminatory conduct, however, are not themselves acts of\r\ndiscrimination and therefore will not satisfy the anchor violation\r\nrequirement.  See DeNovellis, 124 F.3d at 309.    \r\nEven where a plaintiff alleges a violation within the\r\nappropriate statute of limitations period, the continuing violation\r\nclaim will fail if the plaintiff was or should have been aware that\r\nhe was being unlawfully discriminated against while the earlier\r\nacts, now untimely, were taking place.  See Sabree, 921 F.2d at\r\n401-02.  We begin our analysis here, as Provencher has failed to\r\nmeet this critical notice standard.\r\nIn Sabree, we rejected the plaintiff's continuing violation\r\nclaim because the plaintiff admitted that he believed, at every\r\nturn, that he was being discriminated against.  We reasoned that a\r\nknowing plaintiff has an obligation to file promptly or lose his\r\nclaim: \"[t]his can be distinguished from a plaintiff who is unable\r\nto appreciate that he is being discriminated against until he has\r\nlived through a series of acts and is thereby able to perceive the\r\noverall discriminatory pattern.\"  Id.; see also Jensen, 912 F.2d at\r\n522 (\"What matters is whether, when and to what extent the\r\nplaintiff was on inquiry notice.\"); Rush v.

Overall reduced\r\npay is an effect of past discrimination and not itself a\r\ndiscriminatory act.  See Lightfoot v. Union Carbide Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739296\"><a href=\"/opinion/739296/75-fair-emplpraccas-bna-355-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44866-46-fed-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 907 (2d Cir. 1997).  The telephone call, by itself and without\r\nsupporting evidence linking it to Banaian, is insufficient.  And,\r\nwhile context is relevant to determining hostile work environment\r\nclaims, we certainly cannot say that shopping at a store, without\r\nmore, is a ground upon which a sexual harassment claim may rest. \r\n\"We accept that many different forms of offensive behavior may be\r\nincluded within the definition of hostile environment sexual\r\nharassment. . . . However, the overtones of such behavior must be,\r\nat the very least, sex-based, so as to be a recognizable form of\r\nsexual harassment.\"  Morrison v. Carleton Woolen Mills, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197248\"><a href=\"/opinion/197248/morrison-v-carleton/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 441 (1st Cir. 1997).  Provencher's evidence fails to meet\r\nthis threshold.\r\n                   VI.  CONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, we affirm the district court in\r\nall respects.\r\n\nAffirmed.  \n</pre>",
