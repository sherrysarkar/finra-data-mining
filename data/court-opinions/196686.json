Petitioner  challenges the denial of a\r                                \r\n\nmotion  under 28  U.S.C.    2255  to  vacate or  correct  his\r\n\nsentence.  We affirm.\r\n\n          Petitioner was convicted by  a jury, along with his\r\n\ncodefendants, of  conspiring to  possess, and possession  of,\r\n\ncocaine  with intent to distribute in  violation of 21 U.S.C.\r\n\n   841(a)(1), 846.  A charge of use of a  firearm in relation\r\n\nto  a drug offense under 21 U.S.C.   924(c)(1), was dismissed\r\n\nby  the court  for insufficient  evidence, and a  judgment of\r\n\nacquittal  entered  thereon  under   Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  29.\r\n\nPetitioner's  conviction   and   sentence  (to   95   months'\r\n\nimprisonment)  were affirmed  on  appeal.   United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nTorres-Maldonado, 14  F.3d 95,  99, 103-05 (1st  Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 115 S. Ct. 193 (1994).\r                  \r\n\n          The focus  of petitioner's    2255 attack is  a two\r\n\nlevel enhancement of his sentence for possession of a firearm\r\n\nin  connection   with  a   drug  offense  under   U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n2D1.1(b)(1).        (1)   He argues that his counsel rendered\r\n\nineffective assistance  by failing  to object, or  failing to\r\n\nsupport  an objection, to the sentencing increase in light of\r\n\nhis  acquittal  of the  firearms  charge  under 18  U.S.C.   \r\n\n924(c)(1).  The  claim is  belied by the  record which  shows\r\n\nthat  counsel made  a  detailed objection  at the  sentencing\r\n\nhearing,  supported by  reasoned  argument.   The  sentencing\r\n\nenhancement was imposed over this objection because the court\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nfound the facts  sufficient to satisfy  the lesser burden  of\r\n\nproof required for the  enhancement, in that petitioner could\r\n\nhave  reasonably foreseen  his  accomplice's possession  of a\r\n\nweapon, and there was sufficient evidence connecting the drug\r\n\noffenses  to weapons  found at  the scene.   As  to counsel's\r\n\nfailure to  renew the objection on  appeal, petitioner offers\r\n\nno  reason to suspect that  this was other  than a deliberate\r\n\nstrategic  decision,  nor  that  he   reasonably  could  have\r\n\nexpected to succeed in  an  appellate challenge to  the trial\r\n\ncourt's fact-based determination.  See United States v. Vega-\r                                                                         \r\n\nEncarnacion, 914 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1990) (explaining that\r                       \r\n\na sentencing court's assessment of the factual record will be\r\n\nset  aside only  if \"clearly  erroneous\"), cert.  denied, 499\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S. 977 (1991); see also Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48,\r                                                           \r\n\n51  (1st Cir. 1993) (explaining elements  needed to sustain a\r\n\nclaim  of ineffective assistance of counsel).  We thus see no\r\n\n\"clear   error\"  in   the   district  court's   rejection  of\r\n\npetitioner's ineffective assistance  of counsel claim  on the\r\n\nbasis of the record facts.  See id. at 53.\r                                               \r\n\n          (2)    Petitioner  argues   that  because  two  co-\r\n\ndefendants  won   reversals  on  appeal  of   their  firearms\r\n\nconvictions  under  18  U.S.C.      924(c)(1),  the  sentence\r\n\nenhancement  petitioner  received  \"as  a  result   of  their\r                                                                         \r\n\nconvictions  in  the  district  court  should  be   vacated.\"\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nApprehending  no  basis  for  the connection  petitioner  has\r\n\ndrawn, we reject this contention. \r\n\n           (3)   Petitioner  argues  in a  supplement to  his\r\n\nbrief that the  sentence enhancement should  be set aside  in\r\n\nlight of  the Supreme  Court's decision  in Bailey  v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 116 S. Ct. 501 (1995), decided during the pendency of\r                  \r\n\nthis appeal.  We need not decide whether Bailey retroactively\r                                                           \r\n\napplies to this  collateral proceeding, because the  decision\r\n\ndoes not  support, but undermines petitioner's  argument.  In\r\n\nBailey  the Court  defined  the word  \"use\"  in 18  U.S.C.   \r                  \r\n\n924(c)(1), as  requiring proof of \"active  employment\" of the\r\n\nweapon to sustain a conviction.   Id. at 505, 508.  The Court\r                                                 \r\n\nexpressly  distinguished the  statutory term  \"use\" from  the\r\n\npassive \"possession\" of a weapon which may trigger a sentence\r\n\nenhancement under U.S.S.G.    2D1.1(b)(1).   Id. at  508; see\r                                                                         \r\n\nalso United States v. Gary, 74  F.3d 304, 317 n.11 (1st  Cir.\r                                      \r\n\n1996) (explaining that Bailey recognizes that the  sentencing\r                                         \r\n\nguidelines   may   provide   enhancements   based   on   mere\r\n\npossession).\r\n\n          Lastly, the district court did not err in disposing\r\n\nof this  motion without an evidentiary  hearing as petitioner\r\n\noffered no  reason it  could  not be  fairly and  effectively\r\n\n\"heard\" on the papers.

United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601483\"><a href=\"/opinion/601483/charles-d-lema-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining elements needed to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel).   We thus see no \"clear error\" in the district court's rejection of petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim on the basis of the record facts.   See id. at 53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Petitioner argues that because two co-defendants won reversals on appeal of their firearms convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1), the sentence enhancement petitioner received \"as a result of their convictions in the district court should be vacated.\"   Apprehending no basis for the connection petitioner has drawn, we reject this contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Petitioner argues in a supplement to his brief that the sentence enhancement should be set aside in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Bailey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117985\"><a href=\"/opinion/117985/bailey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span> (1995), decided during the pendency of this appeal.   We need not decide whether Bailey retroactively applies to this collateral proceeding, because the decision does not support, but undermines petitioner's argument.   In Bailey the Court defined the word \"use\" in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1), as requiring proof of \"active employment\" of the weapon to sustain a conviction.   Id. at 505, 508.   The Court expressly distinguished the statutory term \"use\" from the passive \"possession\" of a weapon which may trigger a sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).   Id. at 508;  see also United States v. Gary, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196508\"><a href=\"/opinion/196508/united-states-v-gary/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span>, 317 n. 11 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that Bailey recognizes that the sentencing guidelines may provide enhancements based on mere possession).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, the district court did not err in disposing of this motion without an evidentiary hearing as petitioner offered no reason it could not be fairly and effectively \"heard\" on the papers.  See United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195053\"><a href=\"/opinion/195053/united-states-v-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></a></span>, 225-26 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
