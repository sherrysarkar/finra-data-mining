Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                     Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     John W. Spillane, with whom Spillane & Spillane, LLP was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     James T. Hargrove, with whom Dana F. Rodin, Timothy N.\nSchofield, and Goulston & Storrs, P.C. were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         June 26, 2000\n\f\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.        Continental Insurance Company\n\nissued a Business Owners Xtra (BOX) policy to Anthony Bahnan.\n\nThe policy covered a three-family house situated at 17 Mott St.,\n\nWorcester, Massachusetts.     A fire occurred a few months after\n\ncoverage had attached, and Bahnan made a claim.         In the course\n\nof the ensuing investigation, Continental came to suspect that\n\nBahnan had misrepresented the condition of the premises.         From\n\nthat   point     forward,   the    parties'     relationship   became\n\nadversarial.\n\n           For purposes of this appeal, we need not recount the\n\nebb and flow of subsequent events, save only to note that\n\nContinental, though rejecting Bahnan's claim, paid the actual\n\ncash value of the fire loss to the mortgagee designated in the\n\npolicy (one Gordon Koury).    We shall return to the Koury payment\n\nshortly.    Before doing so, however, we deem it fitting to\n\ndescribe the underlying litigation.\n\n           In a variation on the usual insured/insurer         pas de\n\ndeux, Continental seized the initiative.        It sued Bahnan in the\n\ndistrict court under diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1332(a), seeking to recoup the Koury payment and to collect\n\nother damages.    Its complaint contained a claim for intentional\n\nmisrepresentation as well as a claim for deceptive business\n\npractices under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.         Bahnan answered the\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcomplaint and launched a fleet of counterclaims (some of which\n\nalso invoked chapter 93A).\n\n           Following a period of pretrial discovery, Continental\n\nmoved for summary judgment on the counterclaims.      See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56.   The district court granted this motion as to five\n\ncounterclaims, leaving the other four intact.     See Continental\n\nIns. Co. v. Bahnan, C.A. No. 94-11304, slip op. (D. Mass. Nov.\n\n6, 1997) (Bahnan I).   Next, the court conducted a five-day jury\n\ntrial on Continental's misrepresentation claim and Bahnan's\n\nbreach-of-contract counterclaim.      The jury, in answer to a\n\nspecial question, found that Bahnan had knowingly misrepresented\n\na material fact when procuring the policy.       Consequently, it\n\nawarded Continental damages of $56,000 (to reimburse it for the\n\nKoury payment and certain other expenses) and returned a take-\n\nnothing verdict on the tried counterclaim.\n\n           Under Massachusetts law, claims premised on chapter 93A\n\nare triable to the court, not to the jury.     See Nei v. Burley,\n\n446 N.E.2d 674, 677 (Mass. 1983).    In pursuance of this mandate,\n\nJudge Gorton addressed the parties' chapter 93A claims after the\n\ntrial and resolved them in a written rescript.    See Continental\n\nIns. Co. v. Bahnan, C.A. No. 94-11304, slip op. (D. Mass. Feb.\n\n18, 1999) (Bahnan II).     Neither side enjoyed any affirmative\n\nsuccess:   the court found in Bahnan's favor on Continental's\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fchapter      93A    claim     and    in   Continental's      favor    on   Bahnan's\n\nsurviving chapter 93A counterclaims.               This appeal followed.\n\n             Bahnan serves up a salmagundi of arguments.                    We have\n\nreviewed the record with care, and we are satisfied that these\n\narguments      lack    force.        None   requires     extended     discussion.\n\nHence, we offer only a few relatively brief comments, responding\n\nto Bahnan's most loudly bruited points.\n\n             First:     The district court instructed the jury on the\n\nlaw    of     agency     as     it    pertains     to    the      attorney-client\n\nrelationship.         Bahnan assigns error.        We detect none.\n\n             A party is entitled to an instruction on its theory of\n\nthe case as long as that theory is legally valid and factually\n\nsupported.         See Febres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp., ___ F.3d\n\n___, ___ (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 98-1916, slip op. at 10]; United\n\nStates v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1995).                    Bahnan does\n\nnot question the wording of the instruction that the court gave\n\nin    this    instance,       but    alleges    that    it   lacked    sufficient\n\ngrounding in the record and therefore should have been left\n\nunsaid.      The nisi prius roll belies this allegation.\n\n             To put matters into perspective, it should be noted\n\nthat Bahnan predicated his breach-of-contract counterclaim on\n\nContinental's refusal to pay him for the fire damage to the\n\ninsured      structure.        Continental      defended     on   several    bases,\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fincluding the ground that it had rescinded the policy.                  The\n\nevidence   at     trial   suggested   that   an   attorney,   Edward     G.\n\nShamgochian, had accompanied Bahnan when the latter gave his\n\npre-suit examination under oath to the insurer, see Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 175, § 99; that Shamgochian conducted himself in a\n\nmanner consistent with that of a lawyer representing a client;\n\nand that Shamgochian thereafter communicated with Continental's\n\ncounsel on Bahnan's behalf.      The evidence also showed that, when\n\nContinental purposed to rescind the policy, it corresponded with\n\nShamgochian and, in the end, sent the refund-of-premium check to\n\nhim (for forwarding to Bahnan).\n\n           This    evidence   adequately     underpinned   Continental's\n\nargument that Bahnan acquiesced in the rescission by cashing the\n\ncheck.   Similarly, it justified the district court's decision to\n\ninstruct on the attorney-client relationship, notwithstanding\n\ndenials by Shamgochian and Bahnan that such a relationship had\n\nbeen   forged.     Given   standard   principles    of   agency   law   and\n\nShamgochian's actions on Bahnan's behalf, the record supported\n\n— even though it did not compel — a finding that Shamgochian\n\nacted for Bahnan and that delivery of the refund-of-premium\n\ncheck to him, along with explanatory correspondence, was the\n\nfunctional equivalent of delivery to Bahnan.               See Hudson v.\n\nMassachusetts Prop. Ins. Und'g Ass'n, 436 N.E.2d 155, 159 (Mass.\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\f1982); Jones v. Harrar, 95 N.E.2d 646, 648 (Mass. 1950); see\n\nalso   Levin     v.   Berley,    728    F.2d     551,     553    (1st    Cir.   1984)\n\n(explaining that a client is chargeable with knowledge gleaned\n\nby his attorney).\n\n            At any rate, the lower court instructed on the law of\n\nagency and the attorney-client relationship only in regard to\n\nQuestion No. 2, which asked:           \"Did Bahnan prove that Continental\n\nbreached    the    insurance     contract?\"         The    court       painstakingly\n\nexplained to the jurors that this interrogatory related to\n\nBahnan's       breach-of-contract         counterclaim          and    Continental's\n\nrescission       defense.     The     jurors     were    told    not    to    consider\n\nQuestion No. 2 at all if they answered Question No. 1 in the\n\naffirmative.       Because the jurors replied \"yes\" to Question No.\n\n1 (finding, in effect, that the policy was void ab initio by\n\nreason    of     Bahnan's    material     misrepresentation),            they   never\n\nreached    the     rescission     issue    and    thus     had    no    occasion    to\n\nconsider the challenged instruction.               Accordingly, any error was\n\nharmless.      See Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nMutual Fire, Marine & Inland Ins. Co. v. Costa, 789 F.2d 83, 88\n\n(1st Cir. 1986); cf. Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1041 (1st\n\nCir.     1996)    (\"Jurors      are    presumed     to     follow       the   court's\n\ninstructions. . . .\").\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f              Second:    Bahnan's second critique of the charge — his\n\ncontention      that    the    district       court    erred       by   neglecting    to\n\ninstruct      that    only    misrepresentations            made    with    respect   to\n\nconditions      precedent       to     coverage       or     matters       specifically\n\nprescribed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99 could serve to annul\n\nthe policy — is procedurally defaulted and substantively flawed\n\nto boot.\n\n              The    record    makes       manifest    the    procedural       default.\n\nSimply put, Bahnan failed to register this objection at the time\n\nand in the manner dictated by Fed. R. Civ. P. 51.                          We have been\n\nimplacable in our insistence upon strict compliance with the\n\nletter of Rule 51, see, e.g., Faigin, 184 F.3d at 87; Toscano v.\n\nChandris, S.A., 934 F.2d 383, 384-85 (1st Cir. 1991); McGrath v.\n\nSpirito, 733 F.2d 967, 968-69 (1st Cir. 1984), and there are no\n\nexcusatory circumstances here.\n\n              If more were needed — and we do not think that it is\n\n—   Bahnan's        proposed        instruction       was     inaccurate.         Under\n\nMassachusetts law, any material misrepresentation, whether made\n\nbefore or after a policy issues, may serve as a basis for\n\navoiding coverage.           See Shapiro v. American Home Assur. Co., 584\n\nF. Supp. 1245, 1249 (D. Mass. 1984); Hanover Ins. Co. v. Leeds,\n\n674 N.E.2d. 1091, 1096 (Mass. App. Ct. 1997); see also Mass.\n\nGen.   Laws    ch.     175,    §§    99,    186.      Since    Bahnan's       proffered\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\finstruction erroneously limited material misrepresentations to\n\nthose touching upon either conditions precedent or specific\n\nstatutory    requirements,       the     court      properly     rebuffed    it.\n\nVirtually by definition, a trial judge does not err when he or\n\nshe denies a party's request for a jury instruction that is\n\nlegally incorrect.1       See Febres, ___ F.3d at ___ [slip op. at\n\n14]; Faigin, 184 F.3d at 87.\n\n            Third:    Bahnan also calumnizes the district court for\n\nrefusing to charge the jury that Continental's handling of the\n\nmortgage    claim    breached   its    contractual        obligations.      This\n\nattack reflects a gross misunderstanding of both the applicable\n\nlaw and the provisions of the BOX policy.                 We explain briefly.\n\n            At the time of the fire, Koury was owed approximately\n\n$90,000 on the mortgage note.           Continental paid him the actual\n\ncash value of the loss ($50,000).                Refined to bare essence,\n\nBahnan's    position     is   that:      (a)     Continental      was    legally\n\nobligated    to   take   an   assignment       of   the   note   and    mortgage\n\ncoincident with its payment to Koury, and (b) its failure to do\n\nso breached the policy.         Bahnan is wrong on both counts.\n\n\n     1Bahnan seems to suggest that the district court's \"material\nmisrepresentation\" instructions, as given, were wide of the\nmark.    To the extent that he links that argument to his\n\"conditions precedent/specific statutory requirements\" argument,\nwe reject it for the reasons stated in the text. In any event,\nBahnan did not lodge a contemporaneous objection to this aspect\nof the district court's charge, and we see no plain error.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f         The BOX policy contains a rather conventional \"mortgage\n\npayable\" clause that reads in pertinent part:\n\n                If we pay the mortgage holder for any\n         loss or damage and deny payment to you\n         because of your acts or because you have\n         failed to comply with the terms of this\n         policy:\n                • the mortgage holder's rights under\n                the mortgage will be transferred to us\n                to the extent of the amount we pay;\n         and\n                • the mortgage holder's right to\n         recover the full amount of the mortgage\n         holder's claim will not be impaired.\n\n                At our option, we may pay the mortgage\n         holder the whole principal on the mortgage\n         plus any accrued interest. In this event,\n         your mortgage and note will be transferred\n         to us and you will pay your remaining\n         mortgage debt to us.\n\nUnder this proviso,2 the insurer's obligation to the mortgagee\n\nis independent from its obligation to the mortgagor (typically,\n\nthe named insured).   See Pierce v. Sentry Ins., 421 N.E.2d 1252,\n\n\n    2The substance of this clause tracks the corresponding\nstatutory requirement for standard fire insurance policies\nwritten in Massachusetts, viz.:\n\n    [W]henever this company shall be liable to a mortgagee\n    for any sum for loss under this policy for which no\n    liability exists as to the mortgagor, or owner, and\n    this company shall elect by itself, or with others, to\n    pay the mortgagee the full amount secured by such\n    mortgage, then the mortgagee shall assign and transfer\n    to the company interested, upon such payment, the said\n    mortgage together with the note and the debt thereby\n    secured.\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, § 99.\n\n                              -10-\n\f1254 (Mass. App. Ct. 1981).             Where, as here, the insurer has a\n\ndefense         as   to   the   insured/mortgagor,      but    none   as   to   the\n\nmortgagee, it may pay the mortgagee the lesser of the actual\n\ncash value of the loss sustained or the full amount secured by\n\nthe mortgage.         See Eliot Five-Cent Sav. Bank v. Commercial Union\n\nAssur. Co., 7 N.E. 550, 552 (Mass. 1886).                  Only if the insurer\n\nchooses the latter course is it entitled to an assignment of the\n\nnote and mortgage.\n\n                Bahnan's argument merges (or, at least, blurs the\n\ndistinction between) the alternate pathways that this paradigm\n\ncreates.         There is an option, and that option is quite clearly\n\nthe insurer's.            When the insurer elects the former course — as\n\nit did here — it is entitled to limit its payment to the\n\nmortgagee to the actual cash value of the loss sustained.                        In\n\nthat event, however, it has no right to demand an assignment of\n\nthe note and mortgage, but, rather, must leave the mortgagee\n\nfree       to    pursue     a   claim   for     the   unpaid   balance     of   the\n\nindebtedness.3            See Eliot Five-Cent Sav. Bank, 7 N.E.2d at 552.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      We are unimpressed by Bahnan's citation to Money\nStore/Mass., Inc. v. Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 708 N.E.2d 687\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1999). Even if supportive of Bahnan's theory —\na dubious proposition — that opinion was overruled on further\nreview by the Supreme Judicial Court, see 718 N.E.2d 840 (Mass.\n1999), and has no precedential force.\n\n                                         -11-\n\f         Fourth:    Contrary to Bahnan's importunings, the jury's\n\nverdict was supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n\nFor example, Continental presented proof from which a factfinder\n\nreasonably could conclude that Bahnan, when applying for the\n\npolicy, had submitted a false lead paint compliance letter\n\nregarding the second-floor apartment.         It also adduced competent\n\nevidence that this submission was material to the risk because,\n\nwithout the compliance letter, the underwriters would not have\n\nauthorized issuance of the policy.            No more was exigible to\n\njustify a finding that the policy was void (and, hence, a\n\nverdict for Continental).          See Barnstable County Ins. Co. v.\n\nGale, 680 N.E.2d 42, 44 (Mass. 1997) (explaining that a fact is\n\n\"material\"   so   long   as   it    would   naturally   be   expected   to\n\ninfluence an underwriter's judgment in determining whether to\n\nissue a policy).\n\n         Fifth:      Shifting his focus from the trial to the\n\nantecedent summary judgment ruling, Bahnan asseverates that the\n\ndistrict court erred in disposing summarily of two counterclaims\n\nthat aspired to invoke Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 9.            We think\n\nnot.\n\n         Broadly stated, chapter 93A was designed to foster more\n\ncivilized behavior in the business world.         See Arthur D. Little,\n\nInc. v. Dooyang Corp., 147 F.3d 47, 55 (1st Cir. 1998); Quaker\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fSt. Oil Ref. Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., 884 F.2d 1510, 1513 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).    To achieve this laudable end, the statute prohibits\n\nthose engaged in trade or commerce from utilizing \"unfair or\n\ndeceptive     acts    or   practices\"       in   the    course    of   business\n\ntransactions.        Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 2.                 The statute\n\nenforces    this     proscription    in   various       ways,    including   the\n\ncreation of private rights of action.             See, e.g., id. §§ 9, 11.\n\nBy their terms, however, the two sections of chapter 93A that\n\ncreate private rights of action are mutually exclusive:                 section\n\n11 entitles \"[a]ny person who engages in the conduct of any\n\ntrade or commerce\" to bring an action for unfair or deceptive\n\npractices,    whereas      section   9    grants       essentially     the   same\n\nentitlement to aggrieved consumers.              Withal, section 11 affords\n\nno relief to consumers and, conversely, section 9 affords no\n\nrelief to persons engaged in trade or commerce.                  See Employers\n\nIns. of Wausau v. George, 673 N.E.2d. 572, 579 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1996); DiVenuti v. Reardon, 637 N.E.2d 234, 239 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1994).\n\n            Viewed in this light, Bahnan's asseveration that the\n\ndistrict court mistakenly pretermitted his section 9 claims\n\ndepends on how he is classified.            The district court concluded,\n\nas a matter of law, that Bahnan's ownership of the Mott St.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fproperty constituted an engagement in trade or commerce.                            See\n\nBahnan I, slip op. at 9-10.               We agree with this taxonomy.\n\n           The undisputed facts show that Bahnan rented out the\n\nsubject    property,      and        that    he    himself    lived          elsewhere.\n\nMoreover, he applied for and received a business owner's policy,\n\nand in the process completed a commercial insurance application\n\nin which he described his business as \"apartments.\"                           That ends\n\nthe   matter:      as    used       in   chapter    93A,   \"trade       or    commerce\"\n\nspecifically includes \"the offering for sale, rent or lease\n\n[and] the sale, rent, lease or distribution of any . . .\n\nproperty.\"       Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, § 1(b).                            It follows\n\ninexorably that the district court appropriately closed the door\n\non    Bahnan's    section       9    counterclaims.          See    Linthicum        v.\n\nArchambault, 398 N.E.2d 482, 487 (Mass. 1979) (holding that \"a\n\nperson    who    rents   real        property      is   engaged    in    'trade'     or\n\n'commerce'\").\n\n           Sixth: Relatedly, Bahnan protests the district court's\n\nadverse ruling on a counterclaim that invoked an unfair claim\n\nsettlement practices statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D.                             The\n\ndistrict   court    jettisoned           this    counterclaim      at    the    summary\n\njudgment stage, declaring that \"[c]hapter 176D . . . does not\n\ncreate a private right of action for individuals injured by such\n\npractices.\"      Bahnan I, slip op. at 7.               The correctness of that\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fruling cannot seriously be questioned.        See Andrews-Clarke v.\n\nTravelers Ins. Co., 984 F. Supp. 49, 53 & n.20 (D. Mass. 1997);\n\nMahaney v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 380 N.E.2d 140, 142\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1978); see also Pariseau v. Albany Int'l Corp.,\n\n822 F. Supp. 843, 845 (D. Mass. 1993).\n\n            Bahnan's fallback position is that a violation of\n\nchapter 176D sometimes may translate into a violation of chapter\n\n93A (which does create private rights of action).      This is true\n\nas far as it goes — but it does not go far enough to do Bahnan\n\nany good.    A violation of chapter 176D may form the predicate\n\nfor a cause of action under section 9 of chapter 93A, but not\n\nunder section 11.      See Transamerica Ins. Group v. Turner Constr.\n\nCo., 601 N.E.2d 473, 477 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992).      Since Bahnan's\n\naccess to chapter 93A is limited to section 11, see supra, he\n\ncannot maintain a derivative chapter 176D claim.       See Polaroid\n\nCorp. v. Travelers Indem. Corp., 610 N.E.2d 912, 917 (Mass.\n\n1993); Transamerica, 601 N.E.2d at 477.\n\n            Seventh:    Bahnan has one more shot in his sling.   He\n\nasserts that, in       Bahnan II, the district court should have\n\nregarded Continental's supposed infractions of chapter 176D as\n\nper se violations of chapter 93A or otherwise treated them\n\n\"favorably\" (whatever that may mean).      The case law refutes this\n\nassertion.    There is no one-to-one relationship between chapter\n\n176D and chapter 93A.     After all, violations of chapter 176D run\n\nthe gamut from those that are somewhat technical to those that\n\n                                  -15-\n\fare gravely offensive.      Given this range, conduct that abridges\n\nthe unfair claim practice statute may or may not abridge the\n\nunfair trade practice statute.      See F.C.I. Realty Trust v. Aetna\n\nCas. & Sur. Co., 906 F. Supp. 30, 32 n.1 (D. Mass. 1995); Kiewit\n\nConstr. Co. v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., 878 F. Supp. 298, 301-\n\n02 (D. Mass. 1995); Employers Ins. of Wausau, 673 N.E.2d at 579.\n\n           In all events, it is unnecessary to pursue this point.\n\nThe district court, which saw and heard the witnesses, concluded\n\nthat Continental had not sailed too close to the chapter 176D\n\nwinds; to the contrary, the company \"conducted a reasonable and\n\ntimely investigation before refusing to pay Bahnan's fire loss\n\nclaim.\"    Bahnan II, slip op. at 7.            We review the court's\n\nfindings of fact in a jury-waived trial only for clear error.\n\nSee Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st\n\nCir. 1990).    This standard extends to whether a particular act\n\nor series of acts, analyzed in context, are unfair or deceptive\n\nwithin the purview of chapter 93A.         See Ahern v. Scholz, 85 F.3d\n\n774, 797 (1st Cir. 1996).4        We are persuaded here, on whole-\n\nrecord    review,   that   the   court's    finding   that   Continental\n\nsatisfied the imperatives of chapter 176D was amply supported by\n\ncompetent and credible evidence.           So, too, were the court's\n\n    4In this instance, Continental says that its conduct did not\nimplicate chapter 93A as a matter of law. Defining the outer\nboundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a breach of\nchapter 93A presents a question of law, thus engendering plenary\nreview. See Ahern, 85 F.3d at 797. We need not conduct such\nreview here, as the district court's ruling is sustainable as a\nmatter of fact.\n\n                                  -16-\n\ffairness    determinations   under   chapter   93A.

The policy covered a three-family house situated at 17 Mott St., Worcester, Massachusetts. A fire occurred a few months after coverage had attached, and Bahnan made a claim. In the course of the ensuing investigation, Continental came to suspect that Bahnan had misrepresented the condition of the premises. From that point forward, the parties' relationship became adversarial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this appeal, we need not recount the ebb and flow of subsequent events, save only to note that Continental, though rejecting Bahnan's claim, paid the actual cash value of the fire loss to the mortgagee designated in the policy (one Gordon Koury). We shall return to the Koury payment shortly. Before doing so, however, we deem it fitting to describe the underlying litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a variation on the usual insured/insurer pas de deux, Continental seized the initiative. It sued Bahnan in the district court under diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), seeking to recoup the Koury payment and to collect other damages. Its complaint contained a claim for intentional misrepresentation as well as a claim for deceptive business practices under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. Bahnan answered the complaint and launched a fleet of counterclaims (some of which also invoked chapter 93A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a period of pretrial discovery, Continental moved for summary judgment on the counterclaims. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. The district court granted this motion as to five counterclaims, leaving the other four intact. See Continental Ins. Co. v. Bahnan, C.A. No. 94-11304, slip op. (D. Mass. Nov. 6, 1997) (Bahnan I). Next, the court conducted a five-day jury trial on Continental's misrepresentation claim and Bahnan's breach-of-contract counterclaim. The jury, in answer to a special question, found that Bahnan had knowingly misrepresented a material fact when procuring the policy. Consequently, it awarded Continental damages of $56,000 (to reimburse it for the Koury payment and certain other expenses) and returned a take-nothing verdict on the tried counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, claims premised on chapter 93A are triable to the court, not to the jury. See Nei v. Burley, 446 N.E.2d 674, 677 (Mass. 1983). In pursuance of this mandate, Judge Gorton addressed the parties' chapter 93A claims after the trial and resolved them in a written rescript. See Continental Ins. Co. v. Bahnan, C.A. No. 94-11304, slip op. (D. Mass. Feb. 18, 1999) (Bahnan II). Neither side enjoyed any affirmative success: the court found in Bahnan's favor on Continental's chapter 93A claim and in Continental's favor on Bahnan's surviving chapter 93A counterclaims. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bahnan serves up a salmagundi of arguments. We have reviewed the record with care, and we are satisfied that these arguments lack force. None requires extended discussion. Hence, we offer only a few relatively brief comments, responding to Bahnan's most loudly bruited points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First: The district court instructed the jury on the law of agency as it pertains to the attorney-client relationship. Bahnan assigns error. We detect none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party is entitled to an instruction on its theory of the case as long as that theory is legally valid and factually supported. See Febres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp., 214 F.3d 57, ___ (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 98-1916, slip op. at 10]; United States v. DeStefano, 59 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1995). Bahnan does not question the wording of the instruction that the court gave in this instance, but alleges that it lacked sufficient grounding in the record and therefore should have been left unsaid. The nisi prius roll belies this allegation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To put matters into perspective, it should be noted that Bahnan predicated his breach-of-contract counterclaim on Continental's refusal to pay him for the fire damage to the insured structure. Continental defended on several bases, including the ground that it had rescinded the policy. The evidence at trial suggested that an attorney, Edward G. Shamgochian, had accompanied Bahnan when the latter gave his pre-suit examination under oath to the insurer, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99; that Shamgochian conducted himself in a manner consistent with that of a lawyer representing a client; and that Shamgochian thereafter communicated with Continental's counsel on Bahnan's behalf. The evidence also showed that, when Continental purposed to rescind the policy, it corresponded with Shamgochian and, in the end, sent the refund-of-premium check to him (for forwarding to Bahnan).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence adequately underpinned Continental's argument that Bahnan acquiesced in the rescission by cashing the check. Similarly, it justified the district court's decision to instruct on the attorney-client relationship, notwithstanding denials by Shamgochian and Bahnan that such a relationship had been forged. Given standard principles of agency law and Shamgochian's actions on Bahnan's behalf, the record supported - even though it did not compel - a finding that Shamgochian acted for Bahnan and that delivery of the refund-of-premium check to him, along with explanatory correspondence, was the functional equivalent of delivery to Bahnan. See Hudson v. Massachusetts Prop. Ins. Und'g Ass'n, 436 N.E.2d 155, 159 (Mass. 1982); Jones v. Harrar, 95 N.E.2d 646, 648 (Mass. 1950); see also Levin v. Berley, 728 F.2d 551, 553 (1st Cir. 1984) (explaining that a client is chargeable with knowledge gleaned by his attorney).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, the lower court instructed on the law of agency and the attorney-client relationship only in regard to Question No. 2, which asked: \"Did Bahnan prove that Continental breached the insurance contract?\" The court painstakingly explained to the jurors that this interrogatory related to Bahnan's breach-of-contract counterclaim and Continental's rescission defense. The jurors were told not to consider Question No. 2 at all if they answered Question No. 1 in the affirmative. Because the jurors replied \"yes\" to Question No. 1 (finding, in effect, that the policy was void ab initio by reason of Bahnan's material misrepresentation), they never reached the rescission issue and thus had no occasion to consider the challenged instruction. Accordingly, any error was harmless. See Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir. 1999); Mutual Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Ins. Co. v. Costa, 789 F.2d 83, 88 (1st Cir. 1986); cf. Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1041 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"Jurors are presumed to follow the court's instructions....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second: Bahnan's second critique of the charge - his contention that the district court erred by neglecting to instruct that only misrepresentations made with respect to conditions precedent to coverage or matters specifically prescribed by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 could serve to annul the policy - is procedurally defaulted and substantively flawed to boot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record makes manifest the procedural default. Simply put, Bahnan failed to register this objection at the time and in the manner dictated by Fed. R. Civ. P. 51. We have been implacable in our insistence upon strict compliance with the letter of Rule 51, see, e.g., Faigin, 184 F.3d at 87; Toscano v. Chandris, S.A., 934 F.2d 383, 384-85 (1st Cir. 1991); McGrath v. Spirito, 733 F.2d 967, 968-69 (1st Cir. 1984), and there are no excusatory circumstances here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed - and we do not think that it is -Bahnan's proposed instruction was inaccurate. Under Massachusetts law, any material misrepresentation, whether made before or after a policy issues, may serve as a basis for avoiding coverage. See Shapiro v. American Home Assur. Co., 584 F. Supp. 1245, 1249 (D. Mass. 1984); Hanover Ins. Co. v. Leeds, 674 N.E.2d. 1091, 1096 (Mass. App. Ct. 1997); see also Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167;&#167; 99, 186. Since Bahnan's proffered instruction erroneously limited material misrepresentations to those touching upon either conditions precedent or specific statutory requirements, the court properly rebuffed it. Virtually by definition, a trial judge does not err when he or she denies a party's request for a jury instruction that is legally incorrect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See Febres, 214 F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 14]; Faigin, 184 F.3d at 87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third: Bahnan also calumnizes the district court for refusing to charge the jury that Continental's handling of the mortgage claim breached its contractual obligations. This attack reflects a gross misunderstanding of both the applicable law and the provisions of the BOX policy. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the fire, Koury was owed approximately $90,000 on the mortgage note. Continental paid him the actual cash value of the loss ($50,000). Refined to bare essence, Bahnan's position is that: (a) Continental was legally obligated to take an assignment of the note and mortgage coincident with its payment to Koury, and (b) its failure to do so breached the policy. Bahnan is wrong on both counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BOX policy contains a rather conventional \"mortgage payable\" clause that reads in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we pay the mortgage holder for any loss or damage and deny payment to you because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this policy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* the mortgage holder's rights under the mortgage will be transferred to us to the extent of the amount we pay; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* the mortgage holder's right to recover the full amount of the mortgage holder's claim will not be impaired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At our option, we may pay the mortgage holder the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, your mortgage and note will be transferred to us and you will pay your remaining mortgage debt to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this proviso,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the insurer's obligation to the mortgagee is independent from its obligation to the mortgagor (typically, the named insured). See Pierce v. Sentry Ins., 421 N.E.2d 1252, 1254 (Mass. App. Ct. 1981). Where, as here, the insurer has a defense as to the insured/mortgagor, but none as to the mortgagee, it may pay the mortgagee the lesser of the actual cash value of the loss sustained or the full amount secured by the mortgage. See Eliot Five-Cent Sav. Bank v. Commercial Union Assur. Co., 7 N.E. 550, 552 (Mass. 1886). Only if the insurer chooses the latter course is it entitled to an assignment of the note and mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bahnan's argument merges (or, at least, blurs the distinction between) the alternate pathways that this paradigm creates. There is an option, and that option is quite clearly the insurer's. When the insurer elects the former course - as it did here - it is entitled to limit its payment to the mortgagee to the actual cash value of the loss sustained. In that event, however, it has no right to demand an assignment of the note and mortgage, but, rather, must leave the mortgagee free to pursue a claim for the unpaid balance of the indebtedness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Eliot Five-Cent Sav. Bank, 7 N.E.2d at 552.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth: Contrary to Bahnan's importunings, the jury's verdict was supported by substantial evidence in the record. For example, Continental presented proof from which a factfinder reasonably could conclude that Bahnan, when applying for the policy, had submitted a false lead paint compliance letter regarding the second-floor apartment. It also adduced competent evidence that this submission was material to the risk because, without the compliance letter, the underwriters would not have authorized issuance of the policy. No more was exigible to justify a finding that the policy was void (and, hence, a verdict for Continental). See Barnstable County Ins. Co. v. Gale, 680 N.E.2d 42, 44 (Mass. 1997) (explaining that a fact is \"material\" so long as it would naturally be expected to influence an underwriter's judgment in determining whether to issue a policy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth: Shifting his focus from the trial to the antecedent summary judgment ruling, Bahnan asseverates that the district court erred in disposing summarily of two counterclaims that aspired to invoke Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 9. We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Broadly stated, chapter 93A was designed to foster more civilized behavior in the business world. See Arthur D. Little, Inc. v. Dooyang Corp., 147 F.3d 47, 55 (1st Cir. 1998); Quaker St. Oil Ref. Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., 884 F.2d 1510, 1513 (1st Cir. 1989). To achieve this laudable end, the statute prohibits those engaged in trade or commerce from utilizing \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" in the course of business transactions. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 2. The statute enforces this proscription in various ways, including the creation of private rights of action. See, e.g., id. &#167;&#167; 9, 11. By their terms, however, the two sections of chapter 93A that create private rights of action are mutually exclusive: section 11 entitles \"[a]ny person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce\" to bring an action for unfair or deceptive practices, whereas section 9 grants essentially the same entitlement to aggrieved consumers. Withal, section 11 affords no relief to consumers and, conversely, section 9 affords no relief to persons engaged in trade or commerce. See Employers Ins. of Wausau v. George, 673 N.E.2d. 572, 579 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996); DiVenuti v. Reardon, 637 N.E.2d 234, 239 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, Bahnan's asseveration that the district court mistakenly pretermitted his section 9 claims depends on how he is classified. The district court concluded, as a matter of law, that Bahnan's ownership of the Mott St. property constituted an engagement in trade or commerce. See Bahnan I, slip op. at 9-10. We agree with this taxonomy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts show that Bahnan rented out the subject property, and that he himself lived elsewhere. Moreover, he applied for and received a business owner's policy, and in the process completed a commercial insurance application in which he described his business as \"apartments.\" That ends the matter: as used in chapter 93A, \"trade or commerce\" specifically includes \"the offering for sale, rent or lease [and] the sale, rent, lease or distribution of any... property.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 1(b). It follows inexorably that the district court appropriately closed the door on Bahnan's section 9 counterclaims. See Linthicum v. Archambault, 398 N.E.2d 482, 487 (Mass. 1979) (holding that \"a person who rents real property is engaged in 'trade' or 'commerce'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixth: Relatedly, Bahnan protests the district court's adverse ruling on a counterclaim that invoked an unfair claim settlement practices statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D. The district court jettisoned this counterclaim at the summary judgment stage, declaring that \"[c]hapter 176D... does not create a private right of action for individuals injured by such practices.\" Bahnan I, slip op. at 7. The correctness of that ruling cannot seriously be questioned. See Andrews-Clarke v. Travelers Ins. Co., 984 F. Supp. 49, 53 &amp; n.20 (D. Mass. 1997); Mahaney v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., 380 N.E.2d 140, 142 (Mass. App. Ct. 1978); see also Pariseau v. Albany Int'l Corp., 822 F. Supp. 843, 845 (D. Mass. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bahnan's fallback position is that a violation of chapter 176D sometimes may translate into a violation of chapter 93A (which does create private rights of action). This is true as far as it goes - but it does not go far enough to do Bahnan any good. A violation of chapter 176D may form the predicate for a cause of action under section 9 of chapter 93A, but not under section 11. See Transamerica Ins. Group v. Turner Constr. Co., 601 N.E.2d 473, 477 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992). Since Bahnan's access to chapter 93A is limited to section 11, see supra, he cannot maintain a derivative chapter 176D claim. See Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Corp., 610 N.E.2d 912, 917 (Mass. 1993); Transamerica, 601 N.E.2d at 477.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seventh: Bahnan has one more shot in his sling. He asserts that, in Bahnan II, the district court should have regarded Continental's supposed infractions of chapter 176D as per se violations of chapter 93A or otherwise treated them \"favorably\" (whatever that may mean). The case law refutes this assertion. There is no one-to-one relationship between chapter 176D and chapter 93A. After all, violations of chapter 176D run the gamut from those that are somewhat technical to those that are gravely offensive. Given this range, conduct that abridges the unfair claim practice statute may or may not abridge the unfair trade practice statute. See F.C.I. Realty Trust v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 906 F. Supp. 30, 32 n.1 (D. Mass. 1995); Kiewit Constr. Co. v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., 878 F. Supp. 298, 301-02 (D. Mass. 1995); Employers Ins. of Wausau, 673 N.E.2d at 579.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, it is unnecessary to pursue this point. The district court, which saw and heard the witnesses, concluded that Continental had not sailed too close to the chapter 176D winds; to the contrary, the company \"conducted a reasonable and timely investigation before refusing to pay Bahnan's fire loss claim.\" Bahnan II, slip op. at 7. We review the court's findings of fact in a jury-waived trial only for clear error. See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., 902 F.2d 148, 152 (1st Cir. 1990). This standard extends to whether a particular act or series of acts, analyzed in context, are unfair or deceptive within the purview of chapter 93A. See Ahern v. Scholz, 85 F.3d 774, 797 (1st Cir. 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We are persuaded here, on whole-record review, that the court's finding that Continental satisfied the imperatives of chapter 176D was amply supported by competent and credible evidence. So, too, were the court's fairness determinations under chapter 93A. We need go no further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Bahnan seems to suggest that the district court's \"material misrepresentation\" instructions, as given, were wide of the mark. To the extent that he links that argument to his \"conditions precedent/specific statutory requirements\" argument, we reject it for the reasons stated in the text. In any event, Bahnan did not lodge a contemporaneous objection to this aspect of the district court's charge, and we see no plain error.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  The substance of this clause tracks the corresponding statutory requirement for standard fire insurance policies written in Massachusetts, viz.:</p>\n        <p>[W]henever this company shall be liable to a mortgagee for any sum for loss under this policy for which no liability exists as to the mortgagor, or owner, and this company shall elect by itself, or with others, to pay the mortgagee the full amount secured by such mortgage, then the mortgagee shall assign and transfer to the company interested, upon such payment, the said mortgage together with the note and the debt thereby secured.</p>\n        <p>Mass.

Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 708 N.E.2d 687 (Mass. App. Ct. 1999). Even if supportive of Bahnan's theory - a dubious proposition -that opinion was overruled on further review by the Supreme Judicial Court, see 718 N.E.2d 840 (Mass. 1999), and has no precedential force.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  In this instance, Continental says that its conduct did not implicate chapter 93A as a matter of law. Defining the outer boundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a breach of chapter 93A presents a question of law, thus engendering plenary review. See Ahern, 85 F.3d at 797. We need not conduct such review here, as the district court's ruling is sustainable as a matter of fact.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The policy covered a three-family house situated at 17 Mott St., Worcester, Massachusetts. A fire occurred a few months after coverage had attached, and Bahnan made a claim. In the course of the ensuing investigation, Continental came to suspect that Bahnan had misrepresented the condition of the premises. From that point forward, the parties' relationship became adversarial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of this appeal, we need not recount the ebb and flow of subsequent events, save only to note that Continental, though rejecting Bahnan's claim, paid the actual cash value of the fire loss to the mortgagee designated in the policy (one Gordon Koury). We shall return to the Koury payment shortly. Before doing so, however, we deem it fitting to describe the underlying litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a variation on the usual insured/insurer pas de deux, Continental seized the initiative. It sued Bahnan in the district court under diversity jurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a), seeking to recoup the Koury payment and to collect other damages. Its complaint contained a claim for intentional misrepresentation as well as a claim for deceptive business practices under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. Bahnan answered the complaint and launched a fleet of counterclaims (some of which also invoked chapter 93A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a period of pretrial discovery, Continental moved for summary judgment on the counterclaims. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. The district court granted this motion as to five counterclaims, leaving the other four intact. See Continental Ins. Co. v. Bahnan, C.A. No. 94-11304, slip op. (D. Mass. Nov. 6, 1997) (Bahnan I). Next, the court conducted a five-day jury trial on Continental's misrepresentation claim and Bahnan's breach-of-contract counterclaim. The jury, in answer to a special question, found that Bahnan had knowingly misrepresented a material fact when procuring the policy. Consequently, it awarded Continental damages of $56,000 (to reimburse it for the Koury payment and certain other expenses) and returned a take-nothing verdict on the tried counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, claims premised on chapter 93A are triable to the court, not to the jury. See Nei v. Burley, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">446</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></span>, 677 (Mass. 1983). In pursuance of this mandate, Judge Gorton addressed the parties' chapter 93A claims after the trial and resolved them in a written rescript. See Continental Ins. Co. v. Bahnan, C.A. No. 94-11304, slip op. (D. Mass. Feb. 18, 1999) (Bahnan II). Neither side enjoyed any affirmative success: the court found in Bahnan's favor on Continental's chapter 93A claim and in Continental's favor on Bahnan's surviving chapter 93A counterclaims. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bahnan serves up a salmagundi of arguments. We have reviewed the record with care, and we are satisfied that these arguments lack force. None requires extended discussion. Hence, we offer only a few relatively brief comments, responding to Bahnan's most loudly bruited points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First: The district court instructed the jury on the law of agency as it pertains to the attorney-client relationship. Bahnan assigns error. We detect none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party is entitled to an instruction on its theory of the case as long as that theory is legally valid and factually supported. See Febres v. Challenger Caribbean Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198959\"><a href=\"/opinion/198959/febres-morales-v-caribbean/\"><span class=\"volume\">214</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, ___ (1st Cir. 2000) [No. 98-1916, slip op. at 10]; United States v. DeStefano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196179\"><a href=\"/opinion/196179/united-states-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir. 1995). Bahnan does not question the wording of the instruction that the court gave in this instance, but alleges that it lacked sufficient grounding in the record and therefore should have been left unsaid. The nisi prius roll belies this allegation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To put matters into perspective, it should be noted that Bahnan predicated his breach-of-contract counterclaim on Continental's refusal to pay him for the fire damage to the insured structure. Continental defended on several bases, including the ground that it had rescinded the policy. The evidence at trial suggested that an attorney, Edward G. Shamgochian, had accompanied Bahnan when the latter gave his pre-suit examination under oath to the insurer, see Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99; that Shamgochian conducted himself in a manner consistent with that of a lawyer representing a client; and that Shamgochian thereafter communicated with Continental's counsel on Bahnan's behalf. The evidence also showed that, when Continental purposed to rescind the policy, it corresponded with Shamgochian and, in the end, sent the refund-of-premium check to him (for forwarding to Bahnan).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This evidence adequately underpinned Continental's argument that Bahnan acquiesced in the rescission by cashing the check. Similarly, it justified the district court's decision to instruct on the attorney-client relationship, notwithstanding denials by Shamgochian and Bahnan that such a relationship had been forged. Given standard principles of agency law and Shamgochian's actions on Bahnan's behalf, the record supported - even though it did not compel - a finding that Shamgochian acted for Bahnan and that delivery of the refund-of-premium check to him, along with explanatory correspondence, was the functional equivalent of delivery to Bahnan. See Hudson v. Massachusetts Prop. Ins. Und'g Ass'n, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></span>, 159 (Mass. 1982); Jones v.

The jurors were told not to consider Question No. 2 at all if they answered Question No. 1 in the affirmative. Because the jurors replied \"yes\" to Question No. 1 (finding, in effect, that the policy was void ab initio by reason of Bahnan's material misrepresentation), they never reached the rescission issue and thus had no occasion to consider the challenged instruction. Accordingly, any error was harmless. See Faigin v. Kelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198558\"><a href=\"/opinion/198558/faigin-v-kelly-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 87 (1st Cir. 1999); Mutual Fire, Marine &amp; Inland Ins.

Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99 could serve to annul the policy - is procedurally defaulted and substantively flawed to boot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record makes manifest the procedural default. Simply put, Bahnan failed to register this objection at the time and in the manner dictated by Fed. R. Civ. P. 51. We have been implacable in our insistence upon strict compliance with the letter of Rule 51, see, e.g., Faigin, 184 F.3d at 87; Toscano v. Chandris, S.A., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562036\"><a href=\"/opinion/562036/frank-toscano-v-chandris-sa/\"><span class=\"volume\">934</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 384-85 (1st Cir. 1991); McGrath v.

Under Massachusetts law, any material misrepresentation, whether made before or after a policy issues, may serve as a basis for avoiding coverage. See Shapiro v. American Home Assur. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2270245\"><a href=\"/opinion/2270245/shapiro-v-american-home-assur-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">584</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Laws ch. 175, &#167;&#167; 99, 186. Since Bahnan's proffered instruction erroneously limited material misrepresentations to those touching upon either conditions precedent or specific statutory requirements, the court properly rebuffed it. Virtually by definition, a trial judge does not err when he or she denies a party's request for a jury instruction that is legally incorrect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> See Febres, 214 F.3d at ___ [slip op. at 14]; Faigin, 184 F.3d at 87.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third: Bahnan also calumnizes the district court for refusing to charge the jury that Continental's handling of the mortgage claim breached its contractual obligations. This attack reflects a gross misunderstanding of both the applicable law and the provisions of the BOX policy. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time of the fire, Koury was owed approximately $90,000 on the mortgage note. Continental paid him the actual cash value of the loss ($50,000). Refined to bare essence, Bahnan's position is that: (a) Continental was legally obligated to take an assignment of the note and mortgage coincident with its payment to Koury, and (b) its failure to do so breached the policy. Bahnan is wrong on both counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BOX policy contains a rather conventional \"mortgage payable\" clause that reads in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If we pay the mortgage holder for any loss or damage and deny payment to you because of your acts or because you have failed to comply with the terms of this policy:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* the mortgage holder's rights under the mortgage will be transferred to us to the extent of the amount we pay; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* the mortgage holder's right to recover the full amount of the mortgage holder's claim will not be impaired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At our option, we may pay the mortgage holder the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, your mortgage and note will be transferred to us and you will pay your remaining mortgage debt to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under this proviso,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the insurer's obligation to the mortgagee is independent from its obligation to the mortgagor (typically, the named insured). See Pierce v. Sentry Ins., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230456\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230456/pierce-v-sentry-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1252</span></a></span>, 1254 (Mass. App. Ct. 1981). Where, as here, the insurer has a defense as to the insured/mortgagor, but none as to the mortgagee, it may pay the mortgagee the lesser of the actual cash value of the loss sustained or the full amount secured by the mortgage. See Eliot Five-Cent Sav. Bank v. Commercial Union Assur. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></span>, 552 (Mass. 1886). Only if the insurer chooses the latter course is it entitled to an assignment of the note and mortgage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bahnan's argument merges (or, at least, blurs the distinction between) the alternate pathways that this paradigm creates. There is an option, and that option is quite clearly the insurer's. When the insurer elects the former course - as it did here - it is entitled to limit its payment to the mortgagee to the actual cash value of the loss sustained. In that event, however, it has no right to demand an assignment of the note and mortgage, but, rather, must leave the mortgagee free to pursue a claim for the unpaid balance of the indebtedness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> See Eliot Five-Cent Sav. Bank, 7 N.E.2d at 552.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth: Contrary to Bahnan's importunings, the jury's verdict was supported by substantial evidence in the record. For example, Continental presented proof from which a factfinder reasonably could conclude that Bahnan, when applying for the policy, had submitted a false lead paint compliance letter regarding the second-floor apartment. It also adduced competent evidence that this submission was material to the risk because, without the compliance letter, the underwriters would not have authorized issuance of the policy. No more was exigible to justify a finding that the policy was void (and, hence, a verdict for Continental). See Barnstable County Ins. Co. v. Gale, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></span>, 44 (Mass. 1997) (explaining that a fact is \"material\" so long as it would naturally be expected to influence an underwriter's judgment in determining whether to issue a policy).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fifth: Shifting his focus from the trial to the antecedent summary judgment ruling, Bahnan asseverates that the district court erred in disposing summarily of two counterclaims that aspired to invoke Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 9. We think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Broadly stated, chapter 93A was designed to foster more civilized behavior in the business world. See Arthur D. Little, Inc. v. Dooyang Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198029\"><a href=\"/opinion/198029/little-inc-v-dooyang/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir. 1998); Quaker St. Oil Ref. Corp. v. Garrity Oil Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529278\"><a href=\"/opinion/529278/quaker-state-oil-refining-corporation-v-garrity-oil-company-inc-quaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1510</span></a></span>, 1513 (1st Cir. 1989). To achieve this laudable end, the statute prohibits those engaged in trade or commerce from utilizing \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" in the course of business transactions. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 2. The statute enforces this proscription in various ways, including the creation of private rights of action. See, e.g., id. &#167;&#167; 9, 11. By their terms, however, the two sections of chapter 93A that create private rights of action are mutually exclusive: section 11 entitles \"[a]ny person who engages in the conduct of any trade or commerce\" to bring an action for unfair or deceptive practices, whereas section 9 grants essentially the same entitlement to aggrieved consumers. Withal, section 11 affords no relief to consumers and, conversely, section 9 affords no relief to persons engaged in trade or commerce. See Employers Ins. of Wausau v. George, 673 N.E.2d. 572, 579 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996); DiVenuti v. Reardon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2072289\"><a href=\"/opinion/2072289/divenuti-v-reardon/\"><span class=\"volume\">637</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span>, 239 (Mass. App. Ct. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, Bahnan's asseveration that the district court mistakenly pretermitted his section 9 claims depends on how he is classified. The district court concluded, as a matter of law, that Bahnan's ownership of the Mott St. property constituted an engagement in trade or commerce. See Bahnan I, slip op. at 9-10. We agree with this taxonomy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The undisputed facts show that Bahnan rented out the subject property, and that he himself lived elsewhere. Moreover, he applied for and received a business owner's policy, and in the process completed a commercial insurance application in which he described his business as \"apartments.\" That ends the matter: as used in chapter 93A, \"trade or commerce\" specifically includes \"the offering for sale, rent or lease [and] the sale, rent, lease or distribution of any... property.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, &#167; 1(b). It follows inexorably that the district court appropriately closed the door on Bahnan's section 9 counterclaims. See Linthicum v. Archambault, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></span>, 487 (Mass. 1979) (holding that \"a person who rents real property is engaged in 'trade' or 'commerce'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sixth: Relatedly, Bahnan protests the district court's adverse ruling on a counterclaim that invoked an unfair claim settlement practices statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 176D. The district court jettisoned this counterclaim at the summary judgment stage, declaring that \"[c]hapter 176D... does not create a private right of action for individuals injured by such practices.\" Bahnan I, slip op. at 7. The correctness of that ruling cannot seriously be questioned. See Andrews-Clarke v. Travelers Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1401719\"><a href=\"/opinion/1401719/andrews-clarke-v-travelers-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 53 &amp; n.20 (D. Mass. 1997); Mahaney v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></span>, 142 (Mass. App. Ct. 1978); see also Pariseau v. Albany Int'l Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2002510\"><a href=\"/opinion/2002510/pariseau-v-albany-intern-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">843</span></a></span>, 845 (D. Mass. 1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bahnan's fallback position is that a violation of chapter 176D sometimes may translate into a violation of chapter 93A (which does create private rights of action). This is true as far as it goes - but it does not go far enough to do Bahnan any good. A violation of chapter 176D may form the predicate for a cause of action under section 9 of chapter 93A, but not under section 11. See Transamerica Ins. Group v. Turner Constr. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2221939\"><a href=\"/opinion/2221939/transamerica-ins-group-v-turner-construction/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">473</span></a></span>, 477 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992). Since Bahnan's access to chapter 93A is limited to section 11, see supra, he cannot maintain a derivative chapter 176D claim. See Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></span>, 917 (Mass. 1993); Transamerica, 601 N.E.2d at 477.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seventh: Bahnan has one more shot in his sling. He asserts that, in Bahnan II, the district court should have regarded Continental's supposed infractions of chapter 176D as per se violations of chapter 93A or otherwise treated them \"favorably\" (whatever that may mean). The case law refutes this assertion. There is no one-to-one relationship between chapter 176D and chapter 93A. After all, violations of chapter 176D run the gamut from those that are somewhat technical to those that are gravely offensive. Given this range, conduct that abridges the unfair claim practice statute may or may not abridge the unfair trade practice statute. See F.C.I. Realty Trust v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2126567\"><a href=\"/opinion/2126567/fci-realty-trust-v-aetna-cas-sur-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 32 n.1 (D. Mass. 1995); Kiewit Constr. Co. v. Westchester Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1439865\"><a href=\"/opinion/1439865/kiewit-const-co-v-westchester-fire-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">878</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, 301-02 (D. Mass. 1995); Employers Ins. of Wausau, 673 N.E.2d at 579.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, it is unnecessary to pursue this point. The district court, which saw and heard the witnesses, concluded that Continental had not sailed too close to the chapter 176D winds; to the contrary, the company \"conducted a reasonable and timely investigation before refusing to pay Bahnan's fire loss claim.\" Bahnan II, slip op. at 7. We review the court's findings of fact in a jury-waived trial only for clear error. See Cumpiano v. Banco Santander P.R., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540783\"><a href=\"/opinion/540783/wilma-cumpiano-aka-wilma-cumpiano-sanchez-v-banco-santander-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">902</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir. 1990). This standard extends to whether a particular act or series of acts, analyzed in context, are unfair or deceptive within the purview of chapter 93A. See Ahern v. Scholz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196795\"><a href=\"/opinion/196795/ahern-v-scholz/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">774</span></a></span>, 797 (1st Cir. 1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> We are persuaded here, on whole-record review, that the court's finding that Continental satisfied the imperatives of chapter 176D was amply supported by competent and credible evidence. So, too, were the court's fairness determinations under chapter 93A. We need go no further.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>NOTES:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Bahnan seems to suggest that the district court's \"material misrepresentation\" instructions, as given, were wide of the mark. To the extent that he links that argument to his \"conditions precedent/specific statutory requirements\" argument, we reject it for the reasons stated in the text. In any event, Bahnan did not lodge a contemporaneous objection to this aspect of the district court's charge, and we see no plain error.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  The substance of this clause tracks the corresponding statutory requirement for standard fire insurance policies written in Massachusetts, viz.:</p>\n        <p>[W]henever this company shall be liable to a mortgagee for any sum for loss under this policy for which no liability exists as to the mortgagor, or owner, and this company shall elect by itself, or with others, to pay the mortgagee the full amount secured by such mortgage, then the mortgagee shall assign and transfer to the company interested, upon such payment, the said mortgage together with the note and the debt thereby secured.</p>\n        <p>Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 175, &#167; 99.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  We are unimpressed by Bahnan's citation to Money Store/Mass., Inc. v. Hingham Mut. Fire Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">708</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></span> (Mass. App. Ct. 1999). Even if supportive of Bahnan's theory - a dubious proposition -that opinion was overruled on further review by the Supreme Judicial Court, see <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></span> (Mass. 1999), and has no precedential force.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  In this instance, Continental says that its conduct did not implicate chapter 93A as a matter of law. Defining the outer boundaries of what may qualify for consideration as a breach of chapter 93A presents a question of law, thus engendering plenary review. See Ahern, 85 F.3d at 797. We need not conduct such review here, as the district court's ruling is sustainable as a matter of fact.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
