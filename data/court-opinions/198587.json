Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Barry S. Pollack with whom Timothy C. Blank and Dechert Price\r\n&amp; Rhoads were on brief for appellant.\r\n   Donald Campbell Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney,\r\nwith whom Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, was on brief\r\nfor appellee.\r\n\nAugust 2, 1999\r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Joseph Robbio appeals\r\nfrom his conviction in the district court on one count of\r\nconspiracy to transport counterfeit securities, 18 U.S.C.  371,\r\n2314; one count of possession of implements for making counterfeit\r\nsecurities, id.  513; one count of production of false\r\nidentification documents, one count of possession of false\r\nidentification documents, and one count of possession of document-\r\nmaking implements used in production of false identification\r\ndocuments, id.  1028; and two counts of transporting counterfeited\r\nsecurities, id.  2314.  Robbio argues that the court failed\r\nproperly to instruct the jury as to how it should evaluate the\r\ntestimony of a co-defendant who cooperated with the government.  He\r\nalso contends that the district court erroneously calculated his\r\nsentence.  We affirm both the conviction and the sentence.\r\n\n                         I.  FACTS\r\nWe state the facts in a light most favorable to the\r\njury's verdict.  See United States v. Gaines, 170 F.3d 72, 75 (1st\r\nCir. 1999).\r\nAround December 1995, Robbio embarked on a counterfeiting\r\nscheme headquartered in the basement of his home in Cranston, Rhode\r\nIsland.  Using the names and addresses of people with obsolete\r\nchecking accounts, Robbio created counterfeit checks and driver's\r\nlicenses with equipment located in his basement.  He and three\r\ncoconspirators used the counterfeit materials at retail chain\r\nstores in New England that provided cash refunds for returned\r\npurchases under $200.  They repeatedly purchased less than $200 of\r\nmerchandise, paid with counterfeit checks that were verified by\r\ncounterfeit driver's licenses, and then returned the goods for cash\r\nrefunds before the checks bounced.  Until the scheme was\r\ninterrupted in July, 1997, Robbio and his coconspirators passed\r\nmore than 700 counterfeit checks possessing a total face value of\r\nmore than $115,000. \r\nIn March, 1997, Robbio recruited Victor Kiendra to assist\r\nhim.  He explained the counterfeiting scheme to Kiendra and asked\r\nhim to execute it at several New England chain stores.  In\r\nexchange, Robbio offered to share with Kiendra fifty percent of the\r\nprofits from each store Kiendra defrauded, the same arrangement\r\nRobbio had with his two other coconspirators.  From March to July,\r\n1997, Kiendra helped Robbio execute the scheme in Rhode Island,\r\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut. \r\nKiendra was arrested on July 18, 1997, for failing to pay\r\noutstanding traffic citations.  The Fall River Police discovered\r\nsome of the counterfeit licenses in Kiendra's possession and\r\ncontacted the United States Secret Service.  Kiendra immediately\r\nagreed to cooperate with the government.  On the day of his arrest,\r\nKiendra placed a monitored, recorded telephone call to Robbio.  \r\nDuring the telephone conversation, Robbio made several\r\nreferences to the counterfeit check scheme.  When Kiendra told\r\nRobbio that the police had not found \"those other things,\" Robbio\r\nresponded, \"You're lucky. . . . Oh my God, you would have been\r\nspending the weekend in jail if you had those.\"  When Kiendra said\r\nhe would call Robbio later in the week because he had to \"take a\r\nlittle time off,\" Robbio replied, \"Yeah, I know.  I'll go with ya.\r\n. . . We'll go to Caldor's . . . I'm gonna lay off those other\r\nplaces. . . . If you lay off, maybe we can still make a grand here\r\nor there around Christmas time ya know?\"  Five days later, Kiendra\r\nplaced a second monitored, recorded call to  Robbio.  In that\r\nconversation, Robbio told Kiendra, \"I'll get everything ready for\r\ntomorrow. . . . We'll hit some Caldor's.  We'll try some new\r\nspots.\"   Recordings of these conversations were introduced into\r\nevidence at Robbio's trial.\r\nThe day after the second phone call, government agents\r\nexecuted a search warrant at Robbio's home, located at 1149\r\nNarragansett Boulevard in Cranston.  They discovered and seized\r\nseveral items in the basement that had been used to execute the\r\ncounterfeit check scheme: two computers with check-making programs;\r\nspecial pre-printed paper used for making checks, located next to\r\none of the computers; hundreds of counterfeit checks; a manual\r\ndescribing how to create checks; counterfeit driver's licenses with\r\nthe photographs of Robbio, Kiendra, and another coconspirator,\r\nSteven LaFazia; partially completed counterfeit driver's licenses;\r\ntwo laminating machines; a Polaroid camera; and a guide to the\r\ndriver's licenses of the fifty states.  The agents also searched a\r\ncar that was parked in the driveway and registered to Robbio. \r\nInside the vehicle, they found and seized a bag from T.J. Maxx\r\ncontaining merchandise, a receipt, and several personal checks. \r\nThe foregoing items were introduced into evidence at Robbio's\r\ntrial.\r\nOn October 16, 1997, Kiendra entered into a plea\r\nagreement with the government in which he pleaded guilty to one\r\ncount of conspiring to transport counterfeited securities and\r\nagreed to testify for the government at Robbio's trial.  In\r\nexchange, the government dismissed the remaining counts against him\r\nand sought a reduced sentence.  At Robbio's trial, Kiendra\r\ntestified that Robbio had recruited him into the counterfeit\r\nscheme, provided him with the counterfeit checks and licenses, and\r\naccompanied him on many trips to retail stores.  He also testified\r\nthat between March and July of 1997, he personally executed the\r\nscheme \"a couple of hundred times\" and passed approximately $39,000\r\nin counterfeit checks.  In addition to Kiendra, the prosecution's\r\nwitnesses included the government agents who executed the search\r\nwarrant and analyzed the physical evidence, recordkeepers for the\r\nstores that were defrauded, and a victim of the counterfeit check\r\nscheme.\r\nRobbio elected not to testify or call witnesses in his\r\ndefense.  Based upon his cross-examination of Kiendra, Robbio's\r\ncounsel argued to the jury that the government's case depended\r\nentirely on the unreliable testimony of a single witness.  Robbio\r\nmaintained that Kiendra had masterminded the check scheme and \"set\r\nup\" Robbio by using Robbio's basement as the center of operation. \r\nRobbio further argued that Kiendra testified falsely against him in\r\norder to reduce his own sentence.  \r\nFollowing a two-day trial, the jury returned a guilty\r\nverdict on all seven counts of the indictment.  The district court\r\nsentenced Robbio to 48 months of imprisonment.\r\n\n                       II.  ANALYSIS\r\nA.  The Jury Instructions\r\nRobbio challenges his conviction on the grounds that the\r\ndistrict court incorrectly instructed the jury as to how it should\r\nevaluate Kiendra's testimony.  Without defense objection, the court\r\ninstructed the jury inter alia as follows:\r\n\n   You have heard testimony from a Government witness,\r\n   Victor Kiendra, who pleaded guilty to charges arising out\r\n   of the same facts as this case.  You are instructed that\r\n   you are [to] draw no conclusions or inferences of any\r\n   kind about the guilt of the defendant on trial from the\r\n   fact that a prosecution witness plead guilty to similar\r\n   charges.\r\n\n   A witness' decision to plead guilty was a personal\r\n   decision about his own guilt.  It may not be used by you\r\n   in any way as evidence against or favorable to the\r\n   defendant here on trial.\r\n\nRobbio maintains that, even without a defense request,\r\nthe district court should have included a cautionary instruction to\r\nexercise \"greater care\" when assessing the credibility of a\r\ncooperating codefendant witness.  See United States v. Fernandez,\r\n145 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir. 1998).  Robbio further contends that the\r\ndistrict court compounded its error by instructing the jury that it\r\ncould not consider Kiendra's guilty plea as evidence favorable to\r\nRobbio.  Neither of these contentions warrant reversal of Robbio's\r\nconviction.\r\nBecause Robbio made no objection to the given\r\ninstructions nor requested the \"greater care\" instruction, we\r\nreview only for plain error.  See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); United\r\nStates v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).  For such an error to\r\nexist, it must indeed be \"plain\" or \"obvious,\" and it must \"affect\r\nsubstantial rights\"; that is, \"[i]t must have affected the outcome\r\nof the district court proceedings.\"  Fernandez, 145 F.3d at 63\r\n(quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 734).  Additionally, an appellate court\r\nwill remedy such an error only if it appears that it \"seriously\r\naffected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\r\nproceedings.\"  Id. at 63.\r\nThis court has held that a district court need not give\r\nan unrequested cautionary instruction as to the jury's acceptance\r\nof a coconspirator's testimony where the testimony \"looks\r\ninternally consistent and credible,'\" even if the testimony is\r\nuncorroborated.  Id. at 62 (quoting United States v. House, 471\r\nF.2d 886, 888-89 (1st Cir. 1973)).  Kiendra's testimony was,\r\noverall, internally consistent and credible.  Robbio points out\r\nonly one instance of a purported internal inconsistency: at trial,\r\nKiendra initially denied possessing keys to Robbio's residence,\r\nonly to admit upon further questioning that he did briefly possess\r\nthem once, while Robbio was away on vacation.  The admission,\r\nhowever, might be considered as little more than a clarification of\r\nKiendra's earlier statement; it did not detract significantly from\r\nthe consistency and credibility of his testimony as a whole. \r\nKiendra's testimony was not, moreover, uncorroborated.  It was\r\nsupported by a considerable body of other evidence, such as the\r\nhighly inculpatory items seized from the basement of Robbio's home\r\nand his car, and the two recorded telephone conversations in which\r\nRobbio stated his intention to execute the scheme at some Caldor's\r\nstores.  Thus, the district court's omission of the unrequested\r\n\"greater care\" instruction fell well short of amounting to plain\r\nerror.  \r\nRobbio also insists that it was plain error for the court\r\nto state that the jury could not use a witness' decision to plead\r\nguilty \"in any way as evidence against or favorable to the\r\ndefendant.\" [Emphasis supplied.]  Robbio points out that, in\r\nassessing the credibility of Kiendra's testimony, the jury was\r\nentitled to weigh the fact that Kiendra was testifying pursuant to\r\na contingent plea agreement.  The jury, he suggests, might have \r\ninterpreted the challenged instruction as denying it the right to\r\nconsider whether Kiendra's plea agreement, premised on testifying\r\nfor the government in return for a reduced sentence, affected the\r\ntruthfulness of his testimony against Robbio.  Given, however, the\r\ncourt's other instructions, and the fact that the effect of the\r\nplea agreement on Kiendra's credibility was discussed extensively\r\nat trial, we doubt that the challenged language (which related\r\nnarrowly to \"a witness' decision to plead guilty\" and to the fact\r\nthat it was \"a personal decision about his own guilt\") was intended\r\nby the court, or was likely construed by the jury, as denying the\r\njury the right to assess Kiendra's credibility in light of his own\r\nplea agreement.   \r\nJury instructions must be gauged \"in the context of the\r\ncharge as a whole, not in isolation.\"  United States v. Boylan, 898\r\nF.2d 230, 244 (1st Cir. 1990).  Shortly before its instruction\r\nconcerning Kiendra's guilty plea, the district court stated:\r\n   In evaluating the testimony of witnesses you may consider\r\n   several things.  The opportunity of the witness to have\r\n   acquired knowledge of that which they testified to, their\r\n   conduct and demeanor while testifying, their interest or\r\n   lack of interest, if any, in the outcome of this case,\r\n   whether they've been convicted of a felony, their\r\n   intelligence or lack thereof, and the probability or\r\n   improbability of the truth of their testimony.\r\n\n(Emphasis supplied).  This instruction conveyed to the jury that it\r\ncould consider Kiendra's interest in the case and his criminal\r\nhistory when assessing his testimony.  Moreover, Kiendra's plea\r\nagreement was introduced into evidence, and Robbio's counsel cross-\r\nexamined Kiendra extensively about the terms of that agreement and\r\nKiendra's motivation to testify against Robbio.  The government at\r\nno time questioned Robbio's entitlement to pursue such a line of\r\ninquiry at trial, or to argue, as he did, that the plea agreement\r\ndiminished Kiendra's credibility.\r\nFinally, the case against Robbio was very strong, wholly\r\napart from Kiendra's testimony: the items found in the basement of\r\nhis home and in his car; the testimony of other witnesses,\r\nincluding a victim of the counterfeit check scheme and government\r\nagents who executed the warrants and analyzed the evidence; and the\r\ntwo recorded telephone conversations in which Robbio stated his\r\nintention to continue the counterfeiting scheme.  Even supposing it\r\nis possible to read the challenged instruction as erroneously\r\ninhibiting the jury's scrutiny of the plea agreement for\r\nimpeachment purposes, we doubt it reached the level of plain\r\nerror.  We see little reason to suppose either that the parties or\r\njury interpreted this at most ambiguous instruction in the\r\nprejudicial manner now asserted or that it had any effect on the\r\noutcome of the case.\r\n  B.  Sentencing issues\r\n         1.     Intended Loss\r\nAt sentencing, the district court increased Robbio's base\r\noffense level by eight levels based upon a loss calculation of\r\n$237,485.  See U.S.S.G.  2F1.1(b)(1) (eight-level increase for\r\nloss between $200,000 and $350,000).  That figure comprised actual\r\nloss in the amount of $115,985, representing the total face value\r\nof the 714 counterfeit checks passed by Robbio and his\r\ncoconspirators, as well as intended loss in the amount of $121,500,\r\nrepresenting the 750 blank checks found during the execution of the\r\nsearch warrant.  Robbio contends that the court clearly erred by\r\nconsidering losses from wrongdoing that he did not intend to commit\r\nimmediately, but rather might have considered committing at a point\r\nseveral months in the future.\r\nWe review a district court's intended loss findings for\r\nclear error.  United States v. Rizzo, 121 F.3d 794, 803 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  The sentencing guidelines provide that if the loss that the\r\ndefendant intended to inflict can be determined, \"this figure will\r\nbe used if it is greater than the actual loss.\"  U.S.S.G.  2F1.1,\r\ncomment (n.8).  The loss \"need not be determined with precision\";\r\nrather, the district court's reasonable estimate will suffice.  Id.\r\nat n.9.  \r\nWe will uphold an intended loss determination \"where\r\nthere is good evidence of actual intent and some prospect of\r\nsuccess . . .\".  United States v. Egemonye, 62 F.3d 425, 428 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).  Strong evidence supports the district court's\r\ndetermination that Robbio intended to create and pass additional\r\ncounterfeit checks: notably, the package of blank check paper found\r\nnext to the computer in Robbio's basement; his statements in the\r\nrecorded telephone conversations that he and Kiendra would \"go to\r\nCaldor's\" and \"hit some Caldor's\"; and his statement in the second\r\nconversation with Kiendra that he would \"get everything ready for\r\ntomorrow.\" \r\nThere is ample evidence as well of Robbio's prospect of\r\nsuccess had he not been arrested.  He and his coconspirators had\r\nalready executed the scheme more than 700 times before they were\r\ninterrupted.  The court properly weighed the past losses inflicted\r\nby the conspiracy in calculating the intended loss.  See  2F1.1,\r\ncomment (n.9) (district court's estimate of intended loss may be\r\nbased on the approximate number of victims and average of loss to\r\neach victim).  Accordingly, we perceive no error in Robbio's\r\nsentence enhancement for intended loss.\r\n         2.     Refusal to depart downward\r\nAt sentencing, Robbio requested a downward departure\r\npursuant to U.S.S.G.  2F1.1, comment (n.11), which states, in\r\nrelevant part, that \"[in] a few instances, the loss determined\r\nunder subsection (b)(1) may overstate the seriousness of the\r\noffense.\"  The district court denied the request, stating, \"For all\r\nthe reasons I gave in determining the appropriate loss in this\r\ncase, I simply do not see where this is one of those few instances\r\nwhich the note says that the loss overstates the seriousness of the\r\noffense.\"  Robbio now argues that the court erroneously determined\r\nthat it lacked authority to depart downward on \"grounds related to\r\noverstated loss,\" including \"multiple causation,\" \"sentencing\r\nentrapment,\" and \"disparity in loss calculation.\"\r\nUnder the long-standing rule that \"a criminal defendant \r\ncannot ground an appeal on a sentencing court's discretionary\r\ndecision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range,\" we\r\nlack jurisdiction to review a district court's decision to reject\r\na downward departure.  United States v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93, 109\r\n(1st Cir. 1999).  Our review of the transcript of the sentencing\r\nhearing demonstrates that the district court fully comprehended its\r\nauthority to depart downward in an appropriate case, but denied\r\nRobbio's motion because of its perceived lack of merit.  Because\r\nRobbio challenges the district court's exercise of discretion not\r\nto depart downward, we do not have jurisdiction to entertain his\r\nargument.  See United States v. Field, 39 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.\r\n1994).  Furthermore, most of Robbio's current arguments for a\r\ndownward departure are based on grounds he did not raise in the\r\ndistrict court, a fact that further forecloses our consideration of\r\nthose grounds.  Id.\r\n\n3.      Organizer or leader\r\nThe district court found that Robbio was a leader or\r\norganizer of the counterfeiting scheme, and consequently increased\r\nhis base offense level by four levels.  See U.S.S.G. \r\n3B1.1(a)(four-level increase if defendant was an organizer or\r\nleader of a criminal activity that involved five or more\r\nparticipants or was \"otherwise extensive\").  Robbio contends that\r\nthis finding was not based upon sufficient evidence that he played\r\na leading or organizing role.  \r\nWe review the district court's findings for clear error. \r\nSee United States v. D'Andrea, 107 F.3d 949, 956 (1st Cir. 1997). \r\nThe sentencing guidelines state that in determining whether a\r\ndefendant is a leader or organizer, the court should consider (1)\r\nwhether the defendant exercised decision-making authority, (2) the\r\nnature of his participation in the commission of the offense, (3)\r\nthe recruitment of accomplices, (4) the claimed right to a larger\r\nshare of the fruits of the crime, (5) the degree of planning or\r\norganizing the offense, (6) the nature and scope of the illegal\r\nactivity, and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised\r\nover others.  U.S.S.G.  3B1.1, comment (n.4).  There need not be\r\nproof of each and every factor for a defendant to be deemed an\r\norganizer or leader.  See United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d\r\n105,111 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nAt sentencing, the district court found that Robbio\r\nrecruited Kiendra, directed him in executing the scheme, and took\r\n50 percent of the revenues from the scheme.  It also found that the\r\ncriminal activity was extensive, covering several states and\r\ninvolving hundreds of transactions.  Furthermore, evidence at trial\r\nshowed that Robbio organized the scheme from the basement of his\r\nhome, supervised two other coconspirators besides Kiendra in\r\npassing the counterfeit checks, and collected 50 percent of their\r\nrevenues as well, regardless of whether he accompanied them to the\r\nstores.  This evidence satisfies many, if not all, of the factors\r\nset forth above, and is more than sufficient to support the\r\ndistrict court's finding that Robbio was a leader or organizer of\r\nthe scheme.  See United States v. Kneeland, 148 F.3d 6, 16 (1st Cir.\r\n1998). \r\n4.    Prior convictions\r\nThe district court determined that Robbio's criminal\r\nhistory placed him in category III.  See U.S.S.G.  5A (table). \r\nRobbio argues that two of his prior convictions, for trespass and\r\ncounterfeiting, should not have been considered in the calculation. \r\nHe contends that these earlier offenses did not take place within\r\nten years of the unlawful conduct in the present action, which he\r\nasserts started around March 1997.  See U.S.S.G. \r\n4A1.2(e)(2)(criminal history category calculation includes\r\nconsideration of sentences imposed within ten years of offense).  \r\nBecause Robbio did not assert this argument in the\r\ndistrict court, he has forfeited it absent, at least, a showing of\r\nplain error.  Far from demonstrating plain error, the argument\r\nlacks merit altogether.  For purposes of determining a criminal\r\nhistory category under  4A1.2(e)(2), the ten-year period is\r\ndetermined by the date of sentencing, not of conviction.  United\r\nStates v. Perrotta, 42 F.3d 702, 703-04 (1st Cir. 1994).  A review\r\nof the pre-sentence report reveals that Robbio was sentenced on the\r\ntrespass conviction on July 15, 1987, and on the counterfeiting\r\nconviction on November 20, 1987.  Accordingly, these convictions\r\nwere properly considered by the district court in calculating\r\nRobbio's criminal history category.\r\nAffirmed.\r\n",

Using the names and addresses of people with obsolete checking accounts, Robbio created counterfeit checks and driver's licenses with equipment located in his basement. He and three coconspirators used the counterfeit materials at retail chain stores in New England that provided cash refunds for returned purchases under $200. They repeatedly purchased less than $200 of merchandise, paid with counterfeit checks that were verified by counterfeit driver's licenses, and then returned the goods for cash refunds before the checks bounced. Until the scheme was interrupted in July, 1997, Robbio and his coconspirators passed more than 700 counterfeit checks possessing a total face value of more than $115,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March, 1997, Robbio recruited Victor Kiendra to assist him. He explained the counterfeiting scheme to Kiendra and asked him to execute it at several New England chain stores. In exchange, Robbio offered to share with Kiendra fifty percent of the profits from each store Kiendra defrauded, the same arrangement Robbio had with his two other coconspirators. From March to July, 1997, Kiendra helped Robbio execute the scheme in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kiendra was arrested on July 18, 1997, for failing to pay outstanding traffic citations. The Fall River Police discovered some of the counterfeit licenses in Kiendra's possession and contacted the United States Secret Service. Kiendra immediately agreed to cooperate with the government. On the day of his arrest, Kiendra placed a monitored, recorded telephone call to Robbio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the telephone conversation, Robbio made several references to the counterfeit check scheme. When Kiendra told Robbio that the police had not found \"those other things,\" Robbio responded, \"You're lucky. . . . Oh my God, you would have been spending the weekend in jail if you had those.\" When Kiendra said he would call Robbio later in the week because he had to \"take a little time off,\" Robbio replied, \"Yeah, I know. I'll go with ya. . . . We'll go to Caldor's . . . I'm gonna lay off those other places. . . . If you lay off, maybe we can still make a grand here or there around Christmas time ya know?\" Five days later, Kiendra placed a second monitored, recorded call to Robbio. In that conversation, Robbio told Kiendra, \"I'll get everything ready for tomorrow. . . . We'll hit some Caldor's. We'll try some new spots.\" Recordings of these conversations were introduced into evidence at Robbio's trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day after the second phone call, government agents executed a search warrant at Robbio's home, located at 1149 Narragansett Boulevard in Cranston. They discovered and seized several items in the basement that had been used to execute the counterfeit check scheme: two computers with check-making programs; special pre-printed paper used for making checks, located next to one of the computers; hundreds of counterfeit checks; a manual describing how to create checks; counterfeit driver's licenses with the photographs of Robbio, Kiendra, and another coconspirator, Steven LaFazia; partially completed counterfeit driver's licenses; two laminating machines; a Polaroid camera; and a guide to the driver's licenses of the fifty states. The agents also searched a car that was parked in the driveway and registered to Robbio. Inside the vehicle, they found and seized a bag from T.J. Maxx containing merchandise, a receipt, and several personal checks. The foregoing items were introduced into evidence at Robbio's trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 1997, Kiendra entered into a plea agreement with the government in which he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to transport counterfeited securities and agreed to testify for the government at Robbio's trial. In exchange, the government dismissed the remaining counts against him and sought a reduced sentence. At Robbio's trial, Kiendra testified that Robbio had recruited him into the counterfeit scheme, provided him with the counterfeit checks and licenses, and accompanied him on many trips to retail stores. He also testified that between March and July of 1997, he personally executed the scheme \"a couple of hundred times\" and passed approximately $39,000 in counterfeit checks. In addition to Kiendra, the prosecution's witnesses included the government agents who executed the search warrant and analyzed the physical evidence, recordkeepers for the stores that were defrauded, and a victim of the counterfeit check scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robbio elected not to testify or call witnesses in his defense. Based upon his cross-examination of Kiendra, Robbio's counsel argued to the jury that the government's case depended entirely on the unreliable testimony of a single witness. Robbio maintained that Kiendra had masterminded the check scheme and \"set up\" Robbio by using Robbio's basement as the center of operation. Robbio further argued that Kiendra testified falsely against him in order to reduce his own sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a two-day trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all seven counts of the indictment. The district court sentenced Robbio to 48 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robbio challenges his conviction on the grounds that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury as to how it should evaluate Kiendra's testimony. Without defense objection, the court instructed the jury inter alia as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have heard testimony from a Government witness, Victor Kiendra, who pleaded guilty to charges arising out of the same facts as this case. You are instructed that you are [to] draw no conclusions or inferences of any kind about the guilt of the defendant on trial from the fact that a prosecution witness plead guilty to similar charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A witness' decision to plead guilty was a personal decision about his own guilt. It may not be used by you in any way as evidence against or favorable to the defendant here on trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robbio maintains that, even without a defense request, the district court should have included a cautionary instruction to exercise \"greater care\" when assessing the credibility of a cooperating codefendant witness. See United States v. Fernandez, 145 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir. 1998). Robbio further contends that the district court compounded its error by instructing the jury that it could not consider Kiendra's guilty plea as evidence favorable to Robbio. Neither of these contentions warrant reversal of Robbio's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Robbio made no objection to the given instructions nor requested the \"greater care\" instruction, we review only for plain error. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993). For such an error to exist, it must indeed be \"plain\" or \"obvious,\" and it must \"affect substantial rights\"; that is, \"[i]t must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\" Fernandez, 145 F.3d at 63 (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 734). Additionally, an appellate court will remedy such an error only if it appears that it \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Id. at 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has held that a district court need not give an unrequested cautionary instruction as to the jury's acceptance of a coconspirator's testimony where the testimony \"looks internally consistent and credible,'\" even if the testimony is uncorroborated. Id. at 62 (quoting United States v. House, 471 F.2d 886, 888-89 (1st Cir. 1973)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Kiendra's testimony was, overall, internally consistent and credible. Robbio points out only one instance of a purported internal inconsistency: at trial, Kiendra initially denied possessing keys to Robbio's residence, only to admit upon further questioning that he did briefly possess them once, while Robbio was away on vacation. The admission, however, might be considered as little more than a clarification of Kiendra's earlier statement; it did not detract significantly from the consistency and credibility of his testimony as a whole. Kiendra's testimony was not, moreover, uncorroborated. It was supported by a considerable body of other evidence, such as the highly inculpatory items seized from the basement of Robbio's home and his car, and the two recorded telephone conversations in which Robbio stated his intention to execute the scheme at some Caldor's stores. Thus, the district court's omission of the unrequested \"greater care\" instruction fell well short of amounting to plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robbio also insists that it was plain error for the court to state that the jury could not use a witness' decision to plead guilty \"in any way as evidence against or favorable to the defendant.\" [Emphasis supplied.] Robbio points out that, in assessing the credibility of Kiendra's testimony, the jury was entitled to weigh the fact that Kiendra was testifying pursuant to a contingent plea agreement. The jury, he suggests, might have interpreted the challenged instruction as denying it the right to consider whether Kiendra's plea agreement, premised on testifying for the government in return for a reduced sentence, affected the truthfulness of his testimony against Robbio. Given, however, the court's other instructions, and the fact that the effect of the plea agreement on Kiendra's credibility was discussed extensively at trial, we doubt that the challenged language (which related narrowly to \"a witness' decision to plead guilty\" and to the fact that it was \"a personal decision about his own guilt\") was intended by the court, or was likely construed by the jury, as denying the jury the right to assess Kiendra's credibility in light of his own plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury instructions must be gauged \"in the context of the charge as a whole, not in isolation.\" United States v. Boylan, 898 F.2d 230, 244 (1st Cir. 1990). Shortly before its instruction concerning Kiendra's guilty plea, the district court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the testimony of witnesses you may consider several things. The opportunity of the witness to have acquired knowledge of that which they testified to, their conduct and demeanor while testifying, their interest or lack of interest, if any, in the outcome of this case, whether they've been convicted of a felony, their intelligence or lack thereof, and the probability or improbability of the truth of their testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied). This instruction conveyed to the jury that it could consider Kiendra's interest in the case and his criminal history when assessing his testimony. Moreover, Kiendra's plea agreement was introduced into evidence, and Robbio's counsel cross-examined Kiendra extensively about the terms of that agreement and Kiendra's motivation to testify against Robbio. The government at no time questioned Robbio's entitlement to pursue such a line of inquiry at trial, or to argue, as he did, that the plea agreement diminished Kiendra's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the case against Robbio was very strong, wholly apart from Kiendra's testimony: the items found in the basement of his home and in his car; the testimony of other witnesses, including a victim of the counterfeit check scheme and government agents who executed the warrants and analyzed the evidence; and the two recorded telephone conversations in which Robbio stated his intention to continue the counterfeiting scheme. Even supposing it is possible to read the challenged instruction as erroneously inhibiting the jury's scrutiny of the plea agreement for impeachment purposes, we doubt it reached the level of plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We see little reason to suppose either that the parties or jury interpreted this at most ambiguous instruction in the prejudicial manner now asserted or that it had any effect on the outcome of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.\tSentencing issues</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. \tIntended Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court increased Robbio's base offense level by eight levels based upon a loss calculation of $237,485. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1) (eight-level increase for loss between $200,000 and $350,000). That figure comprised actual loss in the amount of $115,985, representing the total face value of the 714 counterfeit checks passed by Robbio and his coconspirators, as well as intended loss in the amount of $121,500, representing the 750 blank checks found during the execution of the search warrant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Robbio contends that the court clearly erred by considering losses from wrongdoing that he did not intend to commit immediately, but rather might have considered committing at a point several months in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's intended loss findings for clear error. United States v. Rizzo, 121 F.3d 794, 803 (1st Cir. 1997). The sentencing guidelines provide that if the loss that the defendant intended to inflict can be determined, \"this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, comment (n.8). The loss \"need not be determined with precision\"; rather, the district court's reasonable estimate will suffice. Id. at n.9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will uphold an intended loss determination \"where there is good evidence of actual intent and some prospect of success . . .\". United States v. Egemonye, 62 F.3d 425, 428 (1st Cir. 1995). Strong evidence supports the district court's determination that Robbio intended to create and pass additional counterfeit checks: notably, the package of blank check paper found next to the computer in Robbio's basement; his statements in the recorded telephone conversations that he and Kiendra would \"go to Caldor's\" and \"hit some Caldor's\"; and his statement in the second conversation with Kiendra that he would \"get everything ready for tomorrow.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is ample evidence as well of Robbio's prospect of success had he not been arrested. He and his coconspirators had already executed the scheme more than 700 times before they were interrupted. The court properly weighed the past losses inflicted by the conspiracy in calculating the intended loss. See &#167; 2F1.1, comment (n.9) (district court's estimate of intended loss may be based on the approximate number of victims and average of loss to each victim). Accordingly, we perceive no error in Robbio's sentence enhancement for intended loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. \tRefusal to depart downward</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Robbio requested a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, comment (n.11), which states, in relevant part, that \"[in] a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the seriousness of the offense.\" The district court denied the request, stating, \"For all the reasons I gave in determining the appropriate loss in this case, I simply do not see where this is one of those few instances which the note says that the loss overstates the seriousness of the offense.\" Robbio now argues that the court erroneously determined that it lacked authority to depart downward on \"grounds related to overstated loss,\" including \"multiple causation,\" \"sentencing entrapment,\" and \"disparity in loss calculation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the long-standing rule that \"a criminal defendant cannot ground an appeal on a sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range,\" we lack jurisdiction to review a district court's decision to reject a downward departure. United States v. Reeder, 170 F.3d 93, 109 (1st Cir. 1999). Our review of the transcript of the sentencing hearing demonstrates that the district court fully comprehended its authority to depart downward in an appropriate case, but denied Robbio's motion because of its perceived lack of merit. Because Robbio challenges the district court's exercise of discretion not to depart downward, we do not have jurisdiction to entertain his argument. See United States v. Field, 39 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 1994). Furthermore, most of Robbio's current arguments for a downward departure are based on grounds he did not raise in the district court, a fact that further forecloses our consideration of those grounds. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Organizer or leader</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Robbio was a leader or organizer of the counterfeiting scheme, and consequently increased his base offense level by four levels. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a)(four-level increase if defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was \"otherwise extensive\"). Robbio contends that this finding was not based upon sufficient evidence that he played a leading or organizing role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's findings for clear error. See United States v. D'Andrea, 107 F.3d 949, 956 (1st Cir. 1997). The sentencing guidelines state that in determining whether a defendant is a leader or organizer, the court should consider (1) whether the defendant exercised decision-making authority, (2) the nature of his participation in the commission of the offense, (3) the recruitment of accomplices, (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, (5) the degree of planning or organizing the offense, (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, comment (n.4). There need not be proof of each and every factor for a defendant to be deemed an organizer or leader. See United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105,111 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found that Robbio recruited Kiendra, directed him in executing the scheme, and took 50 percent of the revenues from the scheme. It also found that the criminal activity was extensive, covering several states and involving hundreds of transactions. Furthermore, evidence at trial showed that Robbio organized the scheme from the basement of his home, supervised two other coconspirators besides Kiendra in passing the counterfeit checks, and collected 50 percent of their revenues as well, regardless of whether he accompanied them to the stores. This evidence satisfies many, if not all, of the factors set forth above, and is more than sufficient to support the district court's finding that Robbio was a leader or organizer of the scheme. See United States v. Kneeland, 148 F.3d 6, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Prior convictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that Robbio's criminal history placed him in category III. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5A (table). Robbio argues that two of his prior convictions, for trespass and counterfeiting, should not have been considered in the calculation. He contends that these earlier offenses did not take place within ten years of the unlawful conduct in the present action, which he asserts started around March 1997. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(e)(2)(criminal history category calculation includes consideration of sentences imposed within ten years of offense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Robbio did not assert this argument in the district court, he has forfeited it absent, at least, a showing of plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Far from demonstrating plain error, the argument lacks merit altogether. For purposes of determining a criminal history category under &#167; 4A1.2(e)(2), the ten-year period is determined by the date of sentencing, not of conviction. United States v. Perrotta, 42 F.3d 702, 703-04 (1st Cir. 1994). A review of the pre-sentence report reveals that Robbio was sentenced on the trespass conviction on July 15, 1987, and on the counterfeiting conviction on November 20, 1987. Accordingly, these convictions were properly considered by the district court in calculating Robbio's criminal history category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Appellant cites to McMillen v. United States, 386 F.2d 29, 32-37 (1st Cir. 1967), for a different rule. The Supreme Court's post-1967 clarification of the plain error standard, and this circuit's own subsequent precedent, make it clear that Fernandez sets forth accurately the standard currently applicable in the present situation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Robbio refers to several other purported deficiencies in the jury charge, none of which were challenged at trial. Specifically, we do not find plain error in Robbio's assertion that the district court erred by using the terms \"willfully\" and \"willingly\" interchangeably when instructing the jury about the requisite mens rea for the charge of conspiracy. Robbio makes no attempt to explain why this deviation prejudiced him in any way. Nor, in light of the powerful evidence of Robbio's guilt, can we say that any of the purported misstatements affected the outcome of the trial. Similarly, we conclude that the district court did not err in instructing the jury that in order to convict on the charge of possession of implements used for the making of counterfeit securities, it must find that the equipment seized from Robbio's basement was either designed for or particularly suited to making counterfeit items. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 513(b). Nor do we discern plain error in the district court's description of reasonable doubt as \"a doubt for which you can give some sound reason.\" See United States v. Glenn, 828 F.2d 855, 861 (1st Cir. 1987); United States v. Macdonald, 455 F.2d 1259, 1262 (1st Cir. 1972).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p>  In calculating the intended loss amount of $121,500, the district court took the average face value of the counterfeit checks that Robbio and his coconspirators had passed before his arrest and multiplied that figure by the number of blank checks. Robbio does not challenge the specifics of the district court's computation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  The fact that Robbio stated in the first recorded conversation that he intended to \"lay off those other places\" and possibly \"make a grand or two around Christmas\" does not alter our conclusion that the finding of requisite intent was supported by sufficient evidence. In both recorded conversations, Robbio indicated his intent to immediately execute the scheme at Caldor's, if not at the \"other places.\" In any event, Robbio points to no authority for the proposition that enhancing a sentence for intended loss based on conduct planned for a point in the future amounts to clear error, and we are aware of none.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  Similarly, Robbio's argument on remand that a prior conviction for disorderly conduct should not have been counted also was forfeited.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Gaines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198451\"><a href=\"/opinion/198451/united-states-v-gaines/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around December 1995, Robbio embarked on a counterfeiting scheme headquartered in the basement of his home in Cranston, Rhode Island. Using the names and addresses of people with obsolete checking accounts, Robbio created counterfeit checks and driver's licenses with equipment located in his basement. He and three coconspirators used the counterfeit materials at retail chain stores in New England that provided cash refunds for returned purchases under $200. They repeatedly purchased less than $200 of merchandise, paid with counterfeit checks that were verified by counterfeit driver's licenses, and then returned the goods for cash refunds before the checks bounced. Until the scheme was interrupted in July, 1997, Robbio and his coconspirators passed more than 700 counterfeit checks possessing a total face value of more than $115,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March, 1997, Robbio recruited Victor Kiendra to assist him. He explained the counterfeiting scheme to Kiendra and asked him to execute it at several New England chain stores. In exchange, Robbio offered to share with Kiendra fifty percent of the profits from each store Kiendra defrauded, the same arrangement Robbio had with his two other coconspirators. From March to July, 1997, Kiendra helped Robbio execute the scheme in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kiendra was arrested on July 18, 1997, for failing to pay outstanding traffic citations. The Fall River Police discovered some of the counterfeit licenses in Kiendra's possession and contacted the United States Secret Service. Kiendra immediately agreed to cooperate with the government. On the day of his arrest, Kiendra placed a monitored, recorded telephone call to Robbio.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the telephone conversation, Robbio made several references to the counterfeit check scheme. When Kiendra told Robbio that the police had not found \"those other things,\" Robbio responded, \"You're lucky. . . . Oh my God, you would have been spending the weekend in jail if you had those.\" When Kiendra said he would call Robbio later in the week because he had to \"take a little time off,\" Robbio replied, \"Yeah, I know. I'll go with ya. . . . We'll go to Caldor's . . . I'm gonna lay off those other places. . . . If you lay off, maybe we can still make a grand here or there around Christmas time ya know?\" Five days later, Kiendra placed a second monitored, recorded call to Robbio. In that conversation, Robbio told Kiendra, \"I'll get everything ready for tomorrow. . . . We'll hit some Caldor's. We'll try some new spots.\" Recordings of these conversations were introduced into evidence at Robbio's trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day after the second phone call, government agents executed a search warrant at Robbio's home, located at 1149 Narragansett Boulevard in Cranston. They discovered and seized several items in the basement that had been used to execute the counterfeit check scheme: two computers with check-making programs; special pre-printed paper used for making checks, located next to one of the computers; hundreds of counterfeit checks; a manual describing how to create checks; counterfeit driver's licenses with the photographs of Robbio, Kiendra, and another coconspirator, Steven LaFazia; partially completed counterfeit driver's licenses; two laminating machines; a Polaroid camera; and a guide to the driver's licenses of the fifty states. The agents also searched a car that was parked in the driveway and registered to Robbio. Inside the vehicle, they found and seized a bag from T.J. Maxx containing merchandise, a receipt, and several personal checks. The foregoing items were introduced into evidence at Robbio's trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 16, 1997, Kiendra entered into a plea agreement with the government in which he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to transport counterfeited securities and agreed to testify for the government at Robbio's trial. In exchange, the government dismissed the remaining counts against him and sought a reduced sentence. At Robbio's trial, Kiendra testified that Robbio had recruited him into the counterfeit scheme, provided him with the counterfeit checks and licenses, and accompanied him on many trips to retail stores. He also testified that between March and July of 1997, he personally executed the scheme \"a couple of hundred times\" and passed approximately $39,000 in counterfeit checks. In addition to Kiendra, the prosecution's witnesses included the government agents who executed the search warrant and analyzed the physical evidence, recordkeepers for the stores that were defrauded, and a victim of the counterfeit check scheme.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robbio elected not to testify or call witnesses in his defense. Based upon his cross-examination of Kiendra, Robbio's counsel argued to the jury that the government's case depended entirely on the unreliable testimony of a single witness. Robbio maintained that Kiendra had masterminded the check scheme and \"set up\" Robbio by using Robbio's basement as the center of operation. Robbio further argued that Kiendra testified falsely against him in order to reduce his own sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a two-day trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all seven counts of the indictment. The district court sentenced Robbio to 48 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robbio challenges his conviction on the grounds that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury as to how it should evaluate Kiendra's testimony. Without defense objection, the court instructed the jury inter alia as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have heard testimony from a Government witness, Victor Kiendra, who pleaded guilty to charges arising out of the same facts as this case. You are instructed that you are [to] draw no conclusions or inferences of any kind about the guilt of the defendant on trial from the fact that a prosecution witness plead guilty to similar charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A witness' decision to plead guilty was a personal decision about his own guilt. It may not be used by you in any way as evidence against or favorable to the defendant here on trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robbio maintains that, even without a defense request, the district court should have included a cautionary instruction to exercise \"greater care\" when assessing the credibility of a cooperating codefendant witness. See United States v. Fernandez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197978\"><a href=\"/opinion/197978/united-states-v-orlando-fernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir. 1998). Robbio further contends that the district court compounded its error by instructing the jury that it could not consider Kiendra's guilty plea as evidence favorable to Robbio. Neither of these contentions warrant reversal of Robbio's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Robbio made no objection to the given instructions nor requested the \"greater care\" instruction, we review only for plain error. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b); United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732 (1993). For such an error to exist, it must indeed be \"plain\" or \"obvious,\" and it must \"affect substantial rights\"; that is, \"[i]t must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\" Fernandez, 145 F.3d at 63 (quoting Olano, 507 U.S. at 734). Additionally, an appellate court will remedy such an error only if it appears that it \"seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Id. at 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court has held that a district court need not give an unrequested cautionary instruction as to the jury's acceptance of a coconspirator's testimony where the testimony \"looks internally consistent and credible,'\" even if the testimony is uncorroborated. Id. at 62 (quoting United States v. House, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"307708\"><a href=\"/opinion/307708/united-states-v-skippy-house-alias-larry-latimer/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span>, 888-89 (1st Cir. 1973)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Kiendra's testimony was, overall, internally consistent and credible. Robbio points out only one instance of a purported internal inconsistency: at trial, Kiendra initially denied possessing keys to Robbio's residence, only to admit upon further questioning that he did briefly possess them once, while Robbio was away on vacation. The admission, however, might be considered as little more than a clarification of Kiendra's earlier statement; it did not detract significantly from the consistency and credibility of his testimony as a whole. Kiendra's testimony was not, moreover, uncorroborated. It was supported by a considerable body of other evidence, such as the highly inculpatory items seized from the basement of Robbio's home and his car, and the two recorded telephone conversations in which Robbio stated his intention to execute the scheme at some Caldor's stores. Thus, the district court's omission of the unrequested \"greater care\" instruction fell well short of amounting to plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robbio also insists that it was plain error for the court to state that the jury could not use a witness' decision to plead guilty \"in any way as evidence against or favorable to the defendant.\" [Emphasis supplied.] Robbio points out that, in assessing the credibility of Kiendra's testimony, the jury was entitled to weigh the fact that Kiendra was testifying pursuant to a contingent plea agreement. The jury, he suggests, might have interpreted the challenged instruction as denying it the right to consider whether Kiendra's plea agreement, premised on testifying for the government in return for a reduced sentence, affected the truthfulness of his testimony against Robbio. Given, however, the court's other instructions, and the fact that the effect of the plea agreement on Kiendra's credibility was discussed extensively at trial, we doubt that the challenged language (which related narrowly to \"a witness' decision to plead guilty\" and to the fact that it was \"a personal decision about his own guilt\") was intended by the court, or was likely construed by the jury, as denying the jury the right to assess Kiendra's credibility in light of his own plea agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jury instructions must be gauged \"in the context of the charge as a whole, not in isolation.\" United States v.

Shortly before its instruction concerning Kiendra's guilty plea, the district court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the testimony of witnesses you may consider several things. The opportunity of the witness to have acquired knowledge of that which they testified to, their conduct and demeanor while testifying, their interest or lack of interest, if any, in the outcome of this case, whether they've been convicted of a felony, their intelligence or lack thereof, and the probability or improbability of the truth of their testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(Emphasis supplied). This instruction conveyed to the jury that it could consider Kiendra's interest in the case and his criminal history when assessing his testimony. Moreover, Kiendra's plea agreement was introduced into evidence, and Robbio's counsel cross-examined Kiendra extensively about the terms of that agreement and Kiendra's motivation to testify against Robbio. The government at no time questioned Robbio's entitlement to pursue such a line of inquiry at trial, or to argue, as he did, that the plea agreement diminished Kiendra's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the case against Robbio was very strong, wholly apart from Kiendra's testimony: the items found in the basement of his home and in his car; the testimony of other witnesses, including a victim of the counterfeit check scheme and government agents who executed the warrants and analyzed the evidence; and the two recorded telephone conversations in which Robbio stated his intention to continue the counterfeiting scheme. Even supposing it is possible to read the challenged instruction as erroneously inhibiting the jury's scrutiny of the plea agreement for impeachment purposes, we doubt it reached the level of plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> We see little reason to suppose either that the parties or jury interpreted this at most ambiguous instruction in the prejudicial manner now asserted or that it had any effect on the outcome of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.\tSentencing issues</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. \tIntended Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court increased Robbio's base offense level by eight levels based upon a loss calculation of $237,485. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1(b)(1) (eight-level increase for loss between $200,000 and $350,000). That figure comprised actual loss in the amount of $115,985, representing the total face value of the 714 counterfeit checks passed by Robbio and his coconspirators, as well as intended loss in the amount of $121,500, representing the 750 blank checks found during the execution of the search warrant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Robbio contends that the court clearly erred by considering losses from wrongdoing that he did not intend to commit immediately, but rather might have considered committing at a point several months in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's intended loss findings for clear error.

The sentencing guidelines provide that if the loss that the defendant intended to inflict can be determined, \"this figure will be used if it is greater than the actual loss.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, comment (n.8). The loss \"need not be determined with precision\"; rather, the district court's reasonable estimate will suffice. Id. at n.9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will uphold an intended loss determination \"where there is good evidence of actual intent and some prospect of success . . .\". United States v. Egemonye, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196220\"><a href=\"/opinion/196220/united-states-v-egemonye/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span>, 428 (1st Cir. 1995). Strong evidence supports the district court's determination that Robbio intended to create and pass additional counterfeit checks: notably, the package of blank check paper found next to the computer in Robbio's basement; his statements in the recorded telephone conversations that he and Kiendra would \"go to Caldor's\" and \"hit some Caldor's\"; and his statement in the second conversation with Kiendra that he would \"get everything ready for tomorrow.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is ample evidence as well of Robbio's prospect of success had he not been arrested. He and his coconspirators had already executed the scheme more than 700 times before they were interrupted. The court properly weighed the past losses inflicted by the conspiracy in calculating the intended loss. See &#167; 2F1.1, comment (n.9) (district court's estimate of intended loss may be based on the approximate number of victims and average of loss to each victim). Accordingly, we perceive no error in Robbio's sentence enhancement for intended loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. \tRefusal to depart downward</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, Robbio requested a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 2F1.1, comment (n.11), which states, in relevant part, that \"[in] a few instances, the loss determined under subsection (b)(1) may overstate the seriousness of the offense.\" The district court denied the request, stating, \"For all the reasons I gave in determining the appropriate loss in this case, I simply do not see where this is one of those few instances which the note says that the loss overstates the seriousness of the offense.\" Robbio now argues that the court erroneously determined that it lacked authority to depart downward on \"grounds related to overstated loss,\" including \"multiple causation,\" \"sentencing entrapment,\" and \"disparity in loss calculation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the long-standing rule that \"a criminal defendant cannot ground an appeal on a sentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below the guideline sentencing range,\" we lack jurisdiction to review a district court's decision to reject a downward departure. United States v. Reeder, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762263\"><a href=\"/opinion/762263/united-states-v-george-wayneti-reeder-aka-wayne-reeder/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span>, 109 (1st Cir. 1999). Our review of the transcript of the sentencing hearing demonstrates that the district court fully comprehended its authority to depart downward in an appropriate case, but denied Robbio's motion because of its perceived lack of merit. Because Robbio challenges the district court's exercise of discretion not to depart downward, we do not have jurisdiction to entertain his argument. See United States v. Field, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195707\"><a href=\"/opinion/195707/united-states-v-field/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir. 1994). Furthermore, most of Robbio's current arguments for a downward departure are based on grounds he did not raise in the district court, a fact that further forecloses our consideration of those grounds. Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Organizer or leader</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Robbio was a leader or organizer of the counterfeiting scheme, and consequently increased his base offense level by four levels. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1(a)(four-level increase if defendant was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was \"otherwise extensive\"). Robbio contends that this finding was not based upon sufficient evidence that he played a leading or organizing role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's findings for clear error. See United States v. D'Andrea, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197235\"><a href=\"/opinion/197235/united-states-v-dandrea/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">949</span></a></span>, 956 (1st Cir. 1997). The sentencing guidelines state that in determining whether a defendant is a leader or organizer, the court should consider (1) whether the defendant exercised decision-making authority, (2) the nature of his participation in the commission of the offense, (3) the recruitment of accomplices, (4) the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, (5) the degree of planning or organizing the offense, (6) the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and (7) the degree of control and authority exercised over others. U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1, comment (n.4). There need not be proof of each and every factor for a defendant to be deemed an organizer or leader. See United States v. Tejada-Beltran, 50 F.3d 105,111 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court found that Robbio recruited Kiendra, directed him in executing the scheme, and took 50 percent of the revenues from the scheme. It also found that the criminal activity was extensive, covering several states and involving hundreds of transactions. Furthermore, evidence at trial showed that Robbio organized the scheme from the basement of his home, supervised two other coconspirators besides Kiendra in passing the counterfeit checks, and collected 50 percent of their revenues as well, regardless of whether he accompanied them to the stores. This evidence satisfies many, if not all, of the factors set forth above, and is more than sufficient to support the district court's finding that Robbio was a leader or organizer of the scheme. See United States v. Kneeland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198022\"><a href=\"/opinion/198022/united-states-v-kneeland/\"><span class=\"volume\">148</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Prior convictions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determined that Robbio's criminal history placed him in category III. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 5A (table). Robbio argues that two of his prior convictions, for trespass and counterfeiting, should not have been considered in the calculation. He contends that these earlier offenses did not take place within ten years of the unlawful conduct in the present action, which he asserts started around March 1997. See U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2(e)(2)(criminal history category calculation includes consideration of sentences imposed within ten years of offense).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Robbio did not assert this argument in the district court, he has forfeited it absent, at least, a showing of plain error.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Far from demonstrating plain error, the argument lacks merit altogether. For purposes of determining a criminal history category under &#167; 4A1.2(e)(2), the ten-year period is determined by the date of sentencing, not of conviction. United States v. Perrotta, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195800\"><a href=\"/opinion/195800/united-states-v-perrotta/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span>, 703-04 (1st Cir. 1994). A review of the pre-sentence report reveals that Robbio was sentenced on the trespass conviction on July 15, 1987, and on the counterfeiting conviction on November 20, 1987. Accordingly, these convictions were properly considered by the district court in calculating Robbio's criminal history category.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p>  Appellant cites to McMillen v.

The Supreme Court's post-1967 clarification of the plain error standard, and this circuit's own subsequent precedent, make it clear that Fernandez sets forth accurately the standard currently applicable in the present situation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p>  Robbio refers to several other purported deficiencies in the jury charge, none of which were challenged at trial. Specifically, we do not find plain error in Robbio's assertion that the district court erred by using the terms \"willfully\" and \"willingly\" interchangeably when instructing the jury about the requisite mens rea for the charge of conspiracy. Robbio makes no attempt to explain why this deviation prejudiced him in any way. Nor, in light of the powerful evidence of Robbio's guilt, can we say that any of the purported misstatements affected the outcome of the trial. Similarly, we conclude that the district court did not err in instructing the jury that in order to convict on the charge of possession of implements used for the making of counterfeit securities, it must find that the equipment seized from Robbio's basement was either designed for or particularly suited to making counterfeit items. See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 513(b). Nor do we discern plain error in the district court's description of reasonable doubt as \"a doubt for which you can give some sound reason.\" See United States v. Glenn, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494122\"><a href=\"/opinion/494122/united-states-v-kenneth-robert-glenn-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span>, 861 (1st Cir. 1987); United States v.

Robbio does not challenge the specifics of the district court's computation.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p>  The fact that Robbio stated in the first recorded conversation that he intended to \"lay off those other places\" and possibly \"make a grand or two around Christmas\" does not alter our conclusion that the finding of requisite intent was supported by sufficient evidence. In both recorded conversations, Robbio indicated his intent to immediately execute the scheme at Caldor's, if not at the \"other places.\" In any event, Robbio points to no authority for the proposition that enhancing a sentence for intended loss based on conduct planned for a point in the future amounts to clear error, and we are aware of none.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p>  Similarly, Robbio's argument on remand that a prior conviction for disorderly conduct should not have been counted also was forfeited.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
