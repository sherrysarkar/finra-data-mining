TANON,\r\n\n                     Plaintiff, Appellee,\r\n\n                              v.\r\n\n               PALADIN PRODUCTS, INC., ET AL.,\r\n\n                         Defendants,\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                       KENNY O'CONNELL,\r\n\n                    Defendant, Appellant.\r\n\n         APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n               FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n          [Hon. Justo Arenas, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Boudin and Stahl,\r\n\n                      Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Thomas C. Jennings III for appellant.\r\n   Sigfredo A. Irizarry-Semidei on brief for appellee.\r\n\nApril 29, 1999\r\n\nSELYA, Circuit Judge.  This appeal trails in the wake of\r\na capsized commercial transaction.  In the underlying litigation,\r\nbrought pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C.  1332(a)\r\n(1994), Ramon A. Tan sued Paladin Products, Inc. (Paladin), a\r\nprinting equipment vendor, and its principal, appellant Kenny\r\nO'Connell.  In his amended complaint, Tan claimed that Paladin,\r\nthrough O'Connell, convinced him to order $167,500 worth of\r\nequipment, accepted a $75,000 deposit, failed to deliver the goods\r\nwithin a reasonable time, and reneged on a promise to rescind the\r\ntransaction and refund his money.  As to O'Connell, Tan claimed\r\nthat, as Paladin's president and sole shareholder, he was the\r\ncompany's alter ego (and, thus, personally answerable for its\r\ndereliction), and that he was guilty of negligent misrepresentation\r\nwhich proximately caused Tan's losses.  Paladin and O'Connell\r\ndefended the suit on substantive grounds, and O'Connell also moved\r\nto dismiss for want of in personam jurisdiction.\r\nThe parties consented to trial before a magistrate judge. \r\nSee 28 U.S.C.  636(c); Fed. R. Civ. P. 73(b).  The magistrate\r\nbifurcated the case, severing the claims against the two\r\ndefendants.  In the first trial, a jury found Paladin liable for\r\nbreach of contract and awarded Tan $96,000.  At a hearing on\r\nPaladin's unsuccessful post-trial motion for judgment as a matter\r\nof law, the magistrate addressed O'Connell's pending motion to\r\ndismiss and, although he found that personal jurisdiction existed,\r\nhe dismissed Tan's claim against O'Connell sua sponte because\r\nTan had not produced evidence sufficient to show that O'Connell\r\nwas Paladin's alter ego.  On appeal, we affirmed the judgment\r\nagainst Paladin, but vacated the judgment in O'Connell's favor on\r\na purely procedural ground, holding that the magistrate had not\r\ngiven any forewarning of his intention to exceed the bounds of the\r\npending motion and reach the issue of O'Connell's substantive\r\nliability.  We concluded that, as a result, \"Tan was never\r\nafforded an adequate opportunity to put his best foot forward and\r\nmuster his evidence on the dispositive point.\"  Tan v. Paladin\r\nProds., Inc., Nos. 96-2059, 96-2060, slip op. at 7 (1st Cir. Oct.\r\n3, 1997) (unpublished) (Tan I).\r\nThe magistrate convened a second trial, limited to\r\nTan's claims against O'Connell.  The jury returned a general\r\nverdict in Tan's favor and the court entered judgment for\r\n$96,000.  O'Connell now appeals.  In a brief that charitably can be\r\ncalled discursive, he makes a plethora of arguments.  They  boil\r\ndown to three main points.  We address each in turn.\r\n1.  O'Connell contends that, under the mandate rule, the\r\nmagistrate erred in permitting the issue of negligent\r\nmisrepresentation to go to the jury.  In the large, the mandate\r\nrule provides that lower courts must comply with the instructions\r\nof a higher court's remand order.  See Field v. Mans, 157 F.3d 35,\r\n40 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247, 251 (1st\r\nCir. 1993).  This means, of course, that courts ordinarily may not\r\nreopen issues that have been decided or foreclosed by a superior\r\ntribunal.  Along these lines, O'Connell contends that our opinion\r\nin Tan I had the effect of limiting the subsequent trial to the\r\nalter ego issue (to the exclusion of the negligence issue).  This\r\ncontention is premised upon a gross misreading of our earlier\r\nopinion.\r\nTo be sure, in Tan I we referred only to the alter ego\r\nclaim   but that was because the magistrate had focused exclusively\r\non that claim.  Our concern, however, was not with Tan's\r\nsubstantive theories of recovery, but, rather, with whether the sua\r\nsponte dismissal deprived Tan of a fair chance to adduce evidence\r\nof O'Connell's liability under any properly pleaded theory.  For\r\nthis reason we stressed that our emphasis was \"procedural,\" Tan\r\nI, slip op. at 6, and, in remanding, we did not in any way restrain\r\nthe lower court from airing any or all of the claims against\r\nO'Connell that Tan had raised in his amended complaint, see id.\r\nat 9 (ordering the lower court to conduct \"further proceedings\r\nconsistent with this opinion\").  To be faithful to that mandate,\r\nthe magistrate, on remand, had an obligation to afford Tan a full\r\nand fair opportunity to prove all the allegations contained in his\r\namended complaint (including the allegations of negligence).  The\r\nmagistrate followed this course precisely.  The assignment of error\r\ntherefore fails.\r\n2.  In a related vein, Tan challenges the jury\r\ninstructions and the admission of evidence insofar as those rulings\r\nrelate to the negligence issue.  For the most part, these\r\nchallenges are bound up in O'Connell's claim that the issue of\r\nnegligence did not belong in the case.  To that extent, the\r\nchallenges lack force.  See supra.\r\nAlthough this circumstance does not entirely close the\r\ndoor, it narrows the aperture considerably.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 51\r\ncompletes the task.  Rule 51 provides that, as a necessary\r\npredicate for assigning error to a jury instruction, an appellant\r\nmust object before the jury retires, state distinctly the matter\r\nobjected to, and limn the grounds of the objection.  In this case,\r\nthe appellant made only a general objection to the giving of any\r\nnegligence instruction.  Under the rule, therefore, the appellant\r\nhas forfeited the right to press other or different objections to\r\nthe charge.  See Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co., 134 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st\r\nCir. 1998); La Amiga del Pueblo, Inc. v. Robles, 937 F.2d 689, 691-\r\n92 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nThe door still remains slightly ajar.  Even in the\r\nabsence of a proper objection, an appellate court may review a jury\r\ninstruction for plain error.  See Moore v. Murphy, 47 F.3d 8, 11\r\n(1st Cir. 1995); Toscano v. Chandris, S.A., 934 F.2d 383, 385 (1st\r\nCir. 1991).  For three reasons, this exception is of no solace to\r\nO'Connell.  First, the plain-error hurdle is high   and it is at\r\nits apex in respect to claims of instructional error in civil\r\ncases.  See Toscano, 934 F.2d at 385; 9A Charles A. Wright &amp; Arthur\r\nR. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure  2558, at 469 (2d ed.\r\n1995) (\"If there is to be a plain error exception to Rule 51 at\r\nall, it should be confined to the exceptional case when the error\r\nseriously has affected the fairness, integrity, or public\r\nreputation of the trial court's proceedings.\").  Second, the\r\nverdict against O'Connell seems amply justified, and justice does\r\nnot appear to have miscarried.  See Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc.,\r\n54 F.3d 931, 940 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining that, to warrant\r\nsetting aside a verdict, an appellant normally must show that an\r\nunpreserved instructional error \"caused a miscarriage of justice or\r\n. . . undermined the integrity of the judicial process\").  Last  \r\nbut surely not least   our review of the instructions in this case\r\nreveals nothing that strikes us as error, let alone error\r\nsufficiently egregious to warrant plain-error review.\r\n3.  The appellant posits that the evidence adduced at\r\ntrial is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the verdict. \r\nThe principal problem with this asseveration is that the appellant\r\nneglected to make a motion for judgment as a matter of law either\r\nat the close of the plaintiff's case in chief, or at the close of\r\nall the evidence.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).  He then compounded\r\nhis lapse by failing to move for judgment notwithstanding the\r\nverdict. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(b).  When a defendant has not made\r\na timely motion for judgment as a matter of law, the court of\r\nappeals ordinarily will not consider the legal sufficiency of the\r\nevidence.  See Hammond v. T.J. Litle &amp; Co., 82 F.3d 1166, 1171 (1st\r\nCir. 1996); La Amiga del Pueblo, 937 F.2d at 691; Jusino v. Zayas,\r\n875 F.2d 986, 991 (1st Cir. 1989).\r\nOf course, in La Amiga del Pueblo we acknowledged that,\r\neven absent such a motion, the court of appeals retains a modicum\r\nof residual discretion to inquire whether the record reflects a\r\ntotal absence of evidentiary support for the jury's verdict.  See\r\nLa Amiga del Pueblo, 937 F.2d at 691.  Here, however, such a\r\ncanvass quickly reveals that the evidence is not so lopsided as to\r\nbring this seldom-invoked discretion into play.\r\nWe need go no further.  Concluding, as we do, that\r\nO'Connell's appeal lacks any semblance of merit, we affirm the\r\njudgment below.\r\n\nAffirmed.  Costs to appellee.\n",
