We affirm in part\r\n\nand reverse in part.\r\n\n                        I.  Background\r                                                  \r\n\n          Jordan  was  employed  as  a risk  manager  by  the\r\n\nPioneer  Plastics Corporation (\"Pioneer\")  from 1989 to April\r\n\n1993.   His primary responsibility was  the investigation and\r\n\nresolution  of claims  filed by  Pioneer employees  under its\r\n\nself-insured workers compensation program.  The investigation\r\n\nphase  included ongoing,  surreptitious \"activity\"  checks on\r\n\ndisabled employees  to verify  that they  were, in  fact, not\r\n\nable to  work.  Toward this  end, in 1990, he  formed his own\r\n\ninvestigation    company,    PineTree   Insurance    Services\r\n\n(\"PineTree\"), and  began submitting invoices  to Pioneer  for\r\n\ninvestigations  and   activity  checks.     Jordan  submitted\r\n\ninvoices on behalf of  PineTree, approved them, mailed checks\r\n\non behalf of  Pioneer to PineTree's P.O. Box,  and ultimately\r\n\nendorsed  and  deposited  these   checks  into  his  personal\r\n\nchecking  account.    The  relationship  between  Jordan  and\r\n\nPineTree violated Pioneer's  prohibition against  undisclosed\r\n\noutside business interests with the potential to influence an\r\n\nemployee's judgment in the performance of his duties.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          In  early  1993,   a  manager  at  Pioneer   became\r\n\nconcerned  about the  high level  of  PineTree expenses.   An\r\n\ninternal   investigation  ensued.     When   another  manager\r\n\nattempted  to contact  PineTree  he could  find no  telephone\r\n\nnumber  or   street  address.     Jordan's  secretary,   when\r\n\nquestioned, revealed that  Jordan hand-delivered the invoices\r\n\nwhich contained  only  a  P.O. box  address.    Upon  further\r\n\ninvestigation,  the box  was discovered  to be  registered to\r\n\nJordan.  On the day following this discovery, Jordan resigned\r\n\nfrom  Pioneer.    After  his  departure,  a  Pioneer  officer\r\n\nsearched    Jordan's    office   and    discovered   PineTree\r\n\ninvestigative reports printed in \"one big long document.\"\r\n\n          Six  months  later,  Jordan was  indicted  on  five\r\n\ncounts of  mail fraud,  18 U.S.C.     1341, 1342,  1346, four\r\n\ncounts of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C.   1343, and a single count of\r\n\nmoney laundering,  18  U.S.C.   1956(a)(1)(B)(ii).   After  a\r\n\nthree  day  jury trial  he was  acquitted  of the  wire fraud\r\n\ncharges.  A mistrial was declared when the jury was unable to\r\n\nreach a verdict on the remaining counts.\r\n\n          In August 1995, while  awaiting retrial, Jordan was\r\n\nindicted  on four  counts of  income tax  evasion, 26  U.S.C.\r\n\n  7201, and two counts  of filing a false income  tax return,\r\n\n26 U.S.C.   7206(1), stemming from the PineTree scheme.  Over\r\n\nhis  objection, the court allowed the  government to join for\r\n\ntrial the tax  indictments and the  remaining mail fraud  and\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nmoney laundering charges.  This time  Jordan was convicted on\r\n\nall  counts and  sentenced to  72 months  imprisonment, three\r\n\nyears  supervised release,  special  assessments of  $600 and\r\n\nrestitution to Pioneer of $158,603.10.\r\n\n                  II.  Joinder and Prejudice\r                                                        \r\n\n          Jordan  renews here  his earlier  objection to  the\r\n\ncourt's  decision  to  allow   the  government  to  join  the\r\n\noutstanding charges from the first trial with the tax evasion\r\n\ncounts.  We note at the outset that  instead of responding to\r\n\nthe government's motion  for joinder under  Fed. R. Crim.  P.\r\n\n13, defendant used his response to argue prejudice under Fed.\r\n\nR.  Crim. P. 14, most often  utilized in a separate motion to\r\n\nsever.   Although  these may  involve different  standards of\r\n\nreview, see United  States v.  Edgar, 82 F.3d  499, 503  (1st\r                                                \r\n\nCir.),  cert.  denied,      U.S.     ,  117  S.  Ct. 184,  65\r                                 \r\n\nU.S.L.W. 3237 (U.S.  Oct. 7, 1996)  (No. 96-178), and  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v. Alosa, 14 F.3d 693, 695 (1st Cir. 1994), basically\r                            \r\n\nour issue is abuse  of discretion with respect to  prejudice.\r\n\nJordan, correctly,  does not dispute that, substantively, all\r\n\noffenses  could have been joined in a single indictment under\r\n\nFed. R.  Crim. P. 8(a).   See United  States v. Clayton,  450\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d  16, 18  (1st Cir.  1971).   This said,  we turn  to the\r\n\nquestion whether the grant of joinder unduly prejudiced.\r\n\n          In order to prevail on this claim, Jordan must make\r\n\n\"a  strong showing of prejudice.\"  United States v. Gray, 958\r                                                                    \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nF.2d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1992).  In United States v. Scivola, 766\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 37 (1st  Cir. 1985),  we observed that  there are  three\r\n\ntypes  of  prejudice  that  can  emerge  from  this  type  of\r\n\nsituation:\r\n\n          (1) the defendant may  become embarrassed\r\n          or  confounded   in  presenting  separate\r\n          defenses;  (2)  proof  that defendant  is\r\n          guilty  of one  offense  may be  used  to\r\n          convict  him  of a  second  offense, even\r\n          though such proof  would be  inadmissible\r\n          in  a  separate  trial  for   the  second\r\n          offense; and  (3) a defendant may wish to\r\n          testify in  his own behalf on  one of the\r\n          offenses but not another, forcing  him to\r\n          choose   the   unwanted  alternative   of\r\n          testifying as to both or testifying as to\r\n          neither.\r\n\nId.  at 41-42  (internal citations  omitted).   Jordan argues\r               \r\n\nhere  that joinder subjected him  to the latter  two types of\r\n\nprejudice.\r\n\n          Jordan  did  not  testify  in   either  trial,  and\r\n\ncontends that  by allowing  the joinder  of the fraud,  money\r\n\nlaundering and  tax  counts, he  was  deprived of  his  Fifth\r\n\nAmendment right to testify as to certain counts but not as to\r\n\nothers.  In support, he relies on our opinion in Alosa, ante,\r                                                                        \r\n\nwhere we remarked  that \"a defendant may deserve  a severance\r\n\nof counts where [he]  makes a convincing showing that  he has\r\n\nboth  important testimony  to give  concerning one  count and\r\n\nstrong need to  refrain from  testifying on the  other.\"   14\r\n\nF.3d  at 695  (internal  citations omitted).    To make  this\r\n\nshowing, a defendant must  timely offer enough information to\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\nthe court to allow it to weigh the needs  of judicial economy\r\n\nversus  \"'the  defendant's  freedom  to  choose   whether  to\r\n\ntestify' as to  a particular charge.\"   Id. (quoting Scivola,\r                                                                        \r\n\n766 F.2d at 43).\r\n\n          In his objection to the government's motion to join\r\n\nindictments, Jordan  argued his need  to testify in  order to\r\n\nproduce a \"good faith\" defense to the tax charges.  See Cheek\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 203-04 (1991) (holding that a\r                            \r\n\ndefendant is  entitled to present his  subjective belief that\r\n\nhe   did  not  violate  the  law,  even  if  such  belief  is\r\n\nobjectively unreasonable).   To  bolster  this assertion,  he\r\n\nincluded an offer of proof  reciting the testimony that would\r\n\nconstitute his defense.1\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Jordan's  offer   of   proof  contained   the   following\r\nassertions:\r\n\n               3) It is anticipated that in the tax\r\n          prosecution  the Defendant  would testify\r\n          that he  has in the past  handled his own\r\n          tax   filings.    He   has  read  various\r\n          instructions  provided  by  the  Internal\r\n          Revenue   Service   and  has   done  some\r\n          independent research  regarding tax laws.\r\n          George  Jordan  was of  the  opinion that\r\n          funds  paid  to   him  from  the  Pioneer\r\n          Plastics Workers' Compensation Trust were\r\n          not taxable pursuant to  Internal Revenue\r\n          Code Section 501(c)(9).\r\n\n               4)  Jordan  would testify  that upon\r\n          filing  for  a  Chapter   13  bankruptcy,\r\n          Jordan, upon advice of bankruptcy counsel\r\n          filed certain forms 1040-X.\r\n\n               5)  Jordan filed form  1040 for 1992\r\n          and  receive  (sic)  a  refund  check  of\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n          It  is difficult  to  dismiss these  grounds.   The\r\n\nunique circumstances  of this case distinguish  it from Alosa\r                                                                         \r\n\nwhere the defendant  sought to  sever a gun  count from  drug\r\n\ntrafficking and  conspiracy charges.    There, the  defendant\r\n\nwanted to testify  on the gun charge  simply to deny  that he\r\n\nhad used the guns for drug trafficking  and that he owned the\r\n\nguns \"for fun.\"   14 F.3d at  695.  We  upheld the denial  of\r\n\nAlosa's  severance  motion because  that testimony  was \"some\r\n\ndistance from  . . . a credible alibi that only the defendant\r\n\ncan  supply showing him to have been elsewhere at the time of\r\n\nthe  crime.\"  Id.  Here, we believe  that Jordan's subjective\r                             \r\n\ntestimony on  the tax charges  is analogous to  the \"credible\r\n\nalibi\"  we  found  lacking in  Alosa.    Only  he can  supply\r                                                \r\n\ntestimony  of his  subjective belief  as permitted  by Cheek,\r                                                                        \r\n\nforthrightly subjecting himself to cross-examination.   We do\r\n\nnot accept  the government's contention that  this belief was\r\n\nadequately before the jury in the form  of Jordan's statement\r\n\non his amended tax form that the income was not taxable.\r\n\n          Nor do  we accept its contention  that Jordan could\r\n\nhave proffered the testimony of his bankruptcy attorney, from\r\n\nwhom Jordan received legal advice, as an effective substitute\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n          approximately $1000, and  in addition,  a\r\n          form  1040-X  regarding  the   Pine  Tree\r\n          income  and  exemptions  under  501(c)(9)\r\n          were filed.\r\n\n               6)  Forms 1040-X were filed for  the\r\n          years 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993.\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nfor  Jordan's own  testimony.   While it  is likely  that the\r\n\nattorney's   testimony  also  would   have  been  helpful  in\r\n\nestablishing a Cheek defense,  Jordan contends in his proffer\r                                \r\n\nthat  he  previously handled  his  own tax  affairs  and also\r\n\nrelied on his own independent legal research.  See supra note\r                                                                    \r\n\n1.   On balance, therefore,  we conclude that  joinder likely\r\n\nhad the  effect of  eviscerating Jordan's planned  defense to\r\n\nthe tax charges.2\r\n\n          The surrender  of this privilege was  capped by the\r\n\ngovernment's maneuvering that got  before the mail fraud jury\r\n\nthe  allegedly fraudulent  tax returns.   The  government had\r\n\nmade  substantial efforts  at the  original trial  seeking to\r\n\nintroduce  the tax  returns as  proof of  intent.   The court\r\n\ntwice  ruled   that  possible  prejudice  from   these  forms\r\n\noutweighed  their relevance under Fed. R. Evid. 403.  We have\r\n\nhere the type of  prejudice outlined in Scivola, 766  F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n41-42,  that of evidence  presented that would  not have been\r\n\nadmissible  at   a  separate  trial.    By  the  joinder  the\r\n\ngovernment has circumvented the court's ruling.  Jury-wise it\r\n\ncould be thought better off with evidence that would point in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  We  emphasize,  however,  that  we  do  not  hold  that a\r\ndefendant's  mere  assertion of  a  Cheek  defense invariably\r                                                     \r\nrequires severance of an  indictment charging tax and non-tax\r\noffenses.  Rather,  the court must  undertake, on a  case-by-\r\ncase  basis,  to  weigh   \"'the  considerations  of  judicial\r\neconomy' against  the defendant's 'freedom  to choose whether\r\nto testify.'\"  Alosa, 14 F.3d at 695 (citations omitted).\r                                \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nan  improper  direction  tied to  an  instruction  not to  so\r\n\nconsider it, than not to have it at all.\r\n\n          We  have  an unusual  situation.    With the  Fifth\r\n\nAmendment  involved should  either, both,  or neither  of the\r\n\nmail fraud, etc. convictions, and tax evasion convictions, be\r\n\nset aside?   There are  recognized benefits (to  all, except,\r\n\nusually,   the   defendant)    in   having   joint    trials.\r\n\nTraditionally, defendants  may, to  an extent, have  to stand\r\n\nthe  cost,  the  extent  to  be  determined  by  the  court's\r\n\ndiscretion.   In the second mail fraud trial, by choosing not\r\n\nto  take the  stand defendant  felt  only one  prejudice, the\r\n\njury's knowledge of the tax cases.  At the original trial the\r\n\ncourt, in excluding evidence  of those charges, had described\r\n\nit as  of minimum value  to the  government.  While  we agree\r\n\nwith Jordan that  it would have  been happier for him  not to\r\n\nhave had that  evidence now get in  through the back  door by\r\n\nthe joinder, we believe it was within the court's discretion,\r\n\nin the absence of a Fifth Amendment problem (such as infected\r\n\nthe tax counts), to subject him  to the ordinary consequences\r\n\nof joinder of indictments.\r\n\n          This  is not to say that Jordan did not endure some\r\n\nloss.  There should be some  limit to the harm the government\r\n\nshould impose to  meet the  court's Rule 403  finding in  the\r\n\noriginal action.  By bringing the tax indictment, and joining\r\n\nit with  the tax charges to  get the tax forms  before a mail\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nfraud  jury, it put Jordan in the proverbial bind -- testify,\r\n\nto your  loss in the mail  fraud case, or do  not testify, to\r\n\nyour loss in the tax case.   Jordan had valid Fifth Amendment\r\n\nreasons for disliking both alternatives, and we do not  think\r\n\nthe government should have it both  ways.  We allow one,  but\r\n\nit  should not  complain  that we  hold  it to  its  original\r\n\ndecision of  non-joinder.   The convictions and  sentences on\r\n\nthe tax counts are vacated.\r\n\n          III.  Requirements of a Scheme to Defraud\r                                                               \r\n\n          Continuing with  the mail fraud  case, Jordan  next\r\n\nargues  that the government  failed to allege  and prove that\r\n\nPioneer suffered actual harm or that he was unjustly enriched\r\n\nas a  result of  the fraud  as required under  the 42  U.S.C.\r\n\n  1341.3      The   government   contends    that   defendant\r\n\naffirmatively  waived  this  ground  by   requesting  a  jury\r\n\ninstruction  on the mail fraud count that did not include any\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  18 U.S.C.   1341 reads in relevant part:\r\n\n          Whoever, having devised  or intending  to\r\n          devise any scheme or artifice to defraud,\r\n          or  for obtaining  money  or property  by\r\n          means of false  or fraudulent  pretenses,\r\n          representations,  or  promises . . .  for\r\n          the purpose  of executing such  scheme or\r\n          artifice  or attempting to  do so, places\r\n          in   any   post   office  or   authorized\r\n          depository for mail matter, any matter or\r\n          thing whatever to be sent to delivered by\r\n          the  Postal Service  . . .  or  takes  or\r\n          receives therefrom . . .  shall be  fined\r\n          under  this title or  imprisoned not more\r\n          than five years or both.\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nmention of actual harm or unjust enrichment.4  We agree.

For the mail fraud case\r\n\nwe add only the following.\r\n\n          Prior to the enactment of 18 U.S.C.   1346 in 1988,\r\n\nthe Supreme Court had  held in McNally v. United  States, 483\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  350, 360 (1987), that schemes to defraud under the mail\r\n\nand  wire fraud  statutes  did not  encompass the  intangible\r\n\nright to  honest government  but were limited  to schemes  to\r\n\ndefraud a victim of money or property.  Congress responded by\r\n\nenacting section  1346, expanding the definition  of fraud to\r\n\ninclude  \"a scheme  or  artifice to  deprive  another of  the\r\n\nintangible right of honest services.\"\r\n\n          In light of the advent of   1346, in order to prove\r\n\nmail  fraud under   1341  the government must  show \"that the\r\n\ndefendant used  the mails  for the  purpose  of executing  or\r\n\nattempting to execute a scheme to  defraud,\" United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  The jury instruction Jordan requested reads as follows:\r\n\n          Intent to Defraud - Defined:\r\n\n               To act with  an \"intent to  defraud\"\r\n          means  to  act  knowingly  and  with  the\r\n          intention or purpose to deceive or cheat.\r\n          An  intent  to  defraud  is  accompanied,\r\n          ordinarily  by  a  desire or  purpose  to\r\n          bring about some gain or benefit to one's\r\n          self.\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nAllard,  926 F.2d 1237, 1242 (1st Cir. 1991), and such scheme\r                  \r\n\nmay include one to deprive another of the intangible right to\r\n\nhonest services,  United States v.  Sawyer, 85 F.3d  713, 732\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1996).  What  is required is  that \"an articulable\r\n\nharm  befall [the  victim]  as a  result  of the  defendant's\r\n\nactivities,  or some  gainful  use must  be  intended by  the\r\n\n[defendant], whether  or not  this use  is profitable in  the\r\n\neconomic sense.\"  United States v.

A defendant  need not\r\n\neven successfully carry out the scheme to defraud in order to\r\n\nbe found guilty.  Id.; Allard, 926 F.2d at 1242.\r                                         \r\n\n          Even if we had  not found Jordan's argument waived,\r\n\nwe agree  that the  government presented  sufficient evidence\r\n\nthat  the jury could have found  that Jordan deprived Pioneer\r\n\nof his services and/or its money through a scheme to defraud.\r\n\n                     IV.

Since we are vacating the  tax convictions,\r\n\nwe need express  no view  on this contention  at the  present\r\n\ntime.\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\n                        V.

He appeals his convictions and sentences.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jordan was employed as a risk manager by the Pioneer Plastics Corporation (\"Pioneer\") from 1989 to April 1993.  His primary responsibility was the investigation and resolution of claims filed by Pioneer employees under its self-insured workers compensation program.  The investigation phase included ongoing, surreptitious \"activity\" checks on disabled employees to verify that they were, in fact, not able to work.  Toward this end, in 1990, he formed his own investigation company, PineTree Insurance Services (\"PineTree\"), and began submitting invoices to Pioneer for investigations and activity checks.  Jordan submitted invoices on behalf of PineTree, approved them, mailed checks on behalf of Pioneer to PineTree's P.O. Box, and ultimately endorsed and deposited these checks into his personal checking account.  The relationship between Jordan and PineTree violated Pioneer's prohibition against undisclosed outside business interests with the potential to influence an employee's judgment in the performance of his duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1993, a manager at Pioneer became concerned about the high level of PineTree expenses.  An internal investigation ensued.  When another manager attempted to contact PineTree he could find no telephone number or street address.  Jordan's secretary, when questioned, revealed that Jordan hand-delivered the invoices which contained only a P.O. box address.  Upon further investigation, the box was discovered to be registered to Jordan.  On the day following this discovery, Jordan resigned from Pioneer.  After his departure, a Pioneer officer searched Jordan's office and discovered PineTree investigative reports printed in \"one big long document.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months later, Jordan was indicted on five counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1342, 1346, four counts of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343, and a single count of money laundering, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii).  After a three day jury trial he was acquitted of the wire fraud charges.  A mistrial was declared when the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1995, while awaiting retrial, Jordan was indicted on four counts of income tax evasion, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7201, and two counts of filing a false income tax return, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(1), stemming from the PineTree scheme.  Over his objection, the court allowed the government to join for trial the tax indictments and the remaining mail fraud and money laundering charges.  This time Jordan was convicted on all counts and sentenced to 72 months imprisonment, three years supervised release, special assessments of $600 and restitution to Pioneer of $158,603.10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Joinder and Prejudice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jordan renews here his earlier objection to the court's decision to allow the government to join the outstanding charges from the first trial with the tax evasion counts.  We note at the outset that instead of responding to the government's motion for joinder under Fed.R.Crim.P. 13, defendant used his response to argue prejudice under Fed.R.Crim.P. 14, most often utilized in a separate motion to sever.  Although these may involve different standards of review, see United States v. Edgar, 82 F.3d 499, 503 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 184, 136 L.Ed.2d 123 (1996), and United States v. Alosa, 14 F.3d 693, 695 (1st Cir.1994), basically our issue is abuse of discretion with respect to prejudice.  Jordan, correctly, does not dispute that, substantively, all offenses could have been joined in a single indictment under Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a).  See United States v. Clayton, 450 F.2d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1971).  This said, we turn to the question whether the grant of joinder unduly prejudiced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prevail on this claim, Jordan must make \"a strong showing of prejudice.\"  United States v. Gray, 958 F.2d 9, 14 (1st Cir.1992).  In United States v. Scivola, 766 F.2d 37 (1st Cir.1985), we observed that there are three types of prejudice that can emerge from this type of situation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>(1) the defendant may become embarrassed or confounded in presenting separate defenses;  (2) proof that defendant is guilty of one offense may be used to convict him of a second offense, even though such proof would be inadmissible in a separate trial for the second offense;  and (3) a defendant may wish to testify in his own behalf on one of the offenses but not another, forcing him to choose the unwanted alternative of testifying as to both or testifying as to neither.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 41-42 (internal citations omitted).  Jordan argues here that joinder subjected him to the latter two types of prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jordan did not testify in either trial, and contends that by allowing the joinder of the fraud, money laundering and tax counts, he was deprived of his Fifth Amendment right to testify as to certain counts but not as to others.  In support, he relies on our opinion in Alosa, ante, where we remarked that \"a defendant may deserve a severance of counts where [he] makes a convincing showing that he has both important testimony to give concerning one count and strong need to refrain from testifying on the other.\"  14 F.3d at 695 (internal citations omitted).  To make this showing, a defendant must timely offer enough information to the court to allow it to weigh the needs of judicial economy versus \" 'the defendant's freedom to choose whether to testify' as to a particular charge.\"  Id. (quoting Scivola, 766 F.2d at 43).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his objection to the government's motion to join indictments, Jordan argued his need to testify in order to produce a \"good faith\" defense to the tax charges.  See Cheek v. United States, 498 U.S. 192, 203-04, 111 S.Ct. 604, 611-12, 112 L.Ed.2d 617 (1991) (holding that a defendant is entitled to present his subjective belief that he did not violate the law, even if such belief is objectively unreasonable).  To bolster this assertion, he included an offer of proof reciting the testimony that would constitute his defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to dismiss these grounds.  The unique circumstances of this case distinguish it from Alosa where the defendant sought to sever a gun count from drug trafficking and conspiracy charges.  There, the defendant wanted to testify on the gun charge simply to deny that he had used the guns for drug trafficking and that he owned the guns \"for fun.\"  14 F.3d at 695.   We upheld the denial of Alosa's severance motion because that testimony was \"some distance from ... a credible alibi that only the defendant can supply showing him to have been elsewhere at the time of the crime.\"  Id. Here, we believe that Jordan's subjective testimony on the tax charges is analogous to the \"credible alibi\" we found lacking in Alosa.   Only he can supply testimony of his subjective belief as permitted by Cheek, forthrightly subjecting himself to cross-examination.  We do not accept the government's contention that this belief was adequately before the jury in the form of Jordan's statement on his amended tax form that the income was not taxable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we accept its contention that Jordan could have proffered the testimony of his bankruptcy attorney, from whom Jordan received legal advice, as an effective substitute for Jordan's own testimony.  While it is likely that the attorney's testimony also would have been helpful in establishing a Cheek defense, Jordan contends in his proffer that he previously handled his own tax affairs and also relied on his own independent legal research.  See supra note 1. On balance, therefore, we conclude that joinder likely had the effect of eviscerating Jordan's planned defense to the tax charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The surrender of this privilege was capped by the government's maneuvering that got before the mail fraud jury the allegedly fraudulent tax returns.  The government had made substantial efforts at the original trial seeking to introduce the tax returns as proof of intent.  The court twice ruled that possible prejudice from these forms outweighed their relevance under Fed.R.Evid. 403.  We have here the type of prejudice outlined in Scivola, 766 F.2d at 41-42, that of evidence presented that would not have been admissible at a separate trial.  By the joinder the government has circumvented the court's ruling.  Jury-wise it could be thought better off with evidence that would point in an improper direction tied to an instruction not to so consider it, than not to have it at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have an unusual situation.  With the Fifth Amendment involved should either, both, or neither of the mail fraud, etc. convictions, and tax evasion convictions, be set aside?   There are recognized benefits (to all, except, usually, the defendant) in having joint trials.  Traditionally, defendants may, to an extent, have to stand the cost, the extent to be determined by the court's discretion.  In the second mail fraud trial, by choosing not to take the stand defendant felt only one prejudice, the jury's knowledge of the tax cases.  At the original trial the court, in excluding evidence of those charges, had described it as of minimum value to the government.  While we agree with Jordan that it would have been happier for him not to have had that evidence now get in through the back door by the joinder, we believe it was within the court's discretion, in the absence of a Fifth Amendment problem (such as infected the tax counts), to subject him to the ordinary consequences of joinder of indictments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that Jordan did not endure some loss.  There should be some limit to the harm the government should impose to meet the court's Rule 403 finding in the original action.  By bringing the tax indictment, and joining it with the tax charges to get the tax forms before a mail fraud jury, it put Jordan in the proverbial bind--testify, to your loss in the mail fraud case, or do not testify, to your loss in the tax case.  Jordan had valid Fifth Amendment reasons for disliking both alternatives, and we do not think the government should have it both ways.  We allow one, but it should not complain that we hold it to its original decision of non-joinder.  The convictions and sentences on the tax counts are vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Requirements of a Scheme to Defraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Continuing with the mail fraud case, Jordan next argues that the government failed to allege and prove that Pioneer suffered actual harm or that he was unjustly enriched as a result of the fraud as required under the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The government contends that defendant affirmatively waived this ground by requesting a jury instruction on the mail fraud count that did not include any mention of actual harm or unjust enrichment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We agree.  See United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800, 808 (1st Cir.1996) (citing United States v. Marder, 48 F.3d 564, 571 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1056, 115 S.Ct. 1441, 131 L.Ed.2d 320 (1995)).  For the mail fraud case we add only the following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the enactment of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1346 in 1988, the Supreme Court had held in McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 360, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 2881-82, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987), that schemes to defraud under the mail and wire fraud statutes did not encompass the intangible right to honest government but were limited to schemes to defraud a victim of money or property.  Congress responded by enacting section 1346, expanding the definition of fraud to include \"a scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the advent of &#167; 1346, in order to prove mail fraud under &#167; 1341 the government must show \"that the defendant used the mails for the purpose of executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud,\" United States v. Allard, 926 F.2d 1237, 1242 (1st Cir.1991), and such scheme may include one to deprive another of the intangible right to honest services, United States v. Sawyer, 85 F.3d 713, 732 (1st Cir.1996).  What is required is that \"an articulable harm befall [the victim] as a result of the defendant's activities, or some gainful use must be intended by the [defendant], whether or not this use is profitable in the economic sense.\"  United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1074-75 (1st Cir.1997).  Actual monetary harm or unjust enrichment is therefore not required.  A defendant need not even successfully carry out the scheme to defraud in order to be found guilty.  Id.; Allard, 926 F.2d at 1242.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we had not found Jordan's argument waived, we agree that the government presented sufficient evidence that the jury could have found that Jordan deprived Pioneer of his services and/or its money through a scheme to defraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Double Jeopardy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Jordan contends that the district court's decision to sentence him on the tax evasion counts and the false filing counts violated the double jeopardy clause, because the latter counts charge lesser included offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  See Rutledge v. United States, 517 U.S. 292, ---- - ----, 116 S.Ct. 1241, 1247-50, 134 L.Ed.2d 419 (1996).

He appeals his convictions and sentences.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jordan was employed as a risk manager by the Pioneer Plastics Corporation (\"Pioneer\") from 1989 to April 1993.  His primary responsibility was the investigation and resolution of claims filed by Pioneer employees under its self-insured workers compensation program.  The investigation phase included ongoing, surreptitious \"activity\" checks on disabled employees to verify that they were, in fact, not able to work.  Toward this end, in 1990, he formed his own investigation company, PineTree Insurance Services (\"PineTree\"), and began submitting invoices to Pioneer for investigations and activity checks.  Jordan submitted invoices on behalf of PineTree, approved them, mailed checks on behalf of Pioneer to PineTree's P.O. Box, and ultimately endorsed and deposited these checks into his personal checking account.  The relationship between Jordan and PineTree violated Pioneer's prohibition against undisclosed outside business interests with the potential to influence an employee's judgment in the performance of his duties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1993, a manager at Pioneer became concerned about the high level of PineTree expenses.  An internal investigation ensued.  When another manager attempted to contact PineTree he could find no telephone number or street address.  Jordan's secretary, when questioned, revealed that Jordan hand-delivered the invoices which contained only a P.O. box address.  Upon further investigation, the box was discovered to be registered to Jordan.  On the day following this discovery, Jordan resigned from Pioneer.  After his departure, a Pioneer officer searched Jordan's office and discovered PineTree investigative reports printed in \"one big long document.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months later, Jordan was indicted on five counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1341, 1342, 1346, four counts of wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343, and a single count of money laundering, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1)(B)(ii).  After a three day jury trial he was acquitted of the wire fraud charges.  A mistrial was declared when the jury was unable to reach a verdict on the remaining counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1995, while awaiting retrial, Jordan was indicted on four counts of income tax evasion, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7201, and two counts of filing a false income tax return, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7206(1), stemming from the PineTree scheme.  Over his objection, the court allowed the government to join for trial the tax indictments and the remaining mail fraud and money laundering charges.  This time Jordan was convicted on all counts and sentenced to 72 months imprisonment, three years supervised release, special assessments of $600 and restitution to Pioneer of $158,603.10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Joinder and Prejudice</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jordan renews here his earlier objection to the court's decision to allow the government to join the outstanding charges from the first trial with the tax evasion counts.  We note at the outset that instead of responding to the government's motion for joinder under Fed.R.Crim.P. 13, defendant used his response to argue prejudice under Fed.R.Crim.P. 14, most often utilized in a separate motion to sever.  Although these may involve different standards of review, see United States v. Edgar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196711\"><a href=\"/opinion/196711/united-states-v-edgar/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span>, 503 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">184</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Jordan, correctly, does not dispute that, substantively, all offenses could have been joined in a single indictment under Fed.R.Crim.P. 8(a).  See United States v. Clayton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"299646\"><a href=\"/opinion/299646/united-states-v-william-clayton/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir.1971).  This said, we turn to the question whether the grant of joinder unduly prejudiced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prevail on this claim, Jordan must make \"a strong showing of prejudice.\"  United States v. Gray, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578671\"><a href=\"/opinion/578671/united-states-v-kent-e-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1992).  In United States v. Scivola, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454551\"><a href=\"/opinion/454551/united-states-v-alfred-scivola-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">766</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1985), we observed that there are three types of prejudice that can emerge from this type of situation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>(1) the defendant may become embarrassed or confounded in presenting separate defenses;  (2) proof that defendant is guilty of one offense may be used to convict him of a second offense, even though such proof would be inadmissible in a separate trial for the second offense;  and (3) a defendant may wish to testify in his own behalf on one of the offenses but not another, forcing him to choose the unwanted alternative of testifying as to both or testifying as to neither.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 41-42 (internal citations omitted).  Jordan argues here that joinder subjected him to the latter two types of prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jordan did not testify in either trial, and contends that by allowing the joinder of the fraud, money laundering and tax counts, he was deprived of his Fifth Amendment right to testify as to certain counts but not as to others.  In support, he relies on our opinion in Alosa, ante, where we remarked that \"a defendant may deserve a severance of counts where [he] makes a convincing showing that he has both important testimony to give concerning one count and strong need to refrain from testifying on the other.\"  14 F.3d at 695 (internal citations omitted).  To make this showing, a defendant must timely offer enough information to the court to allow it to weigh the needs of judicial economy versus \" 'the defendant's freedom to choose whether to testify' as to a particular charge.\"  Id. (quoting Scivola, 766 F.2d at 43).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his objection to the government's motion to join indictments, Jordan argued his need to testify in order to produce a \"good faith\" defense to the tax charges.  See Cheek v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112517\"><a href=\"/opinion/112517/cheek-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 203-04, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112517\"><a href=\"/opinion/112517/cheek-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">604</span></a></span>, 611-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112517\"><a href=\"/opinion/112517/cheek-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span> (1991) (holding that a defendant is entitled to present his subjective belief that he did not violate the law, even if such belief is objectively unreasonable).  To bolster this assertion, he included an offer of proof reciting the testimony that would constitute his defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to dismiss these grounds.  The unique circumstances of this case distinguish it from Alosa where the defendant sought to sever a gun count from drug trafficking and conspiracy charges.  There, the defendant wanted to testify on the gun charge simply to deny that he had used the guns for drug trafficking and that he owned the guns \"for fun.\"  14 F.3d at 695.   We upheld the denial of Alosa's severance motion because that testimony was \"some distance from ... a credible alibi that only the defendant can supply showing him to have been elsewhere at the time of the crime.\"  Id. Here, we believe that Jordan's subjective testimony on the tax charges is analogous to the \"credible alibi\" we found lacking in Alosa.   Only he can supply testimony of his subjective belief as permitted by Cheek, forthrightly subjecting himself to cross-examination.  We do not accept the government's contention that this belief was adequately before the jury in the form of Jordan's statement on his amended tax form that the income was not taxable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor do we accept its contention that Jordan could have proffered the testimony of his bankruptcy attorney, from whom Jordan received legal advice, as an effective substitute for Jordan's own testimony.  While it is likely that the attorney's testimony also would have been helpful in establishing a Cheek defense, Jordan contends in his proffer that he previously handled his own tax affairs and also relied on his own independent legal research.  See supra note 1. On balance, therefore, we conclude that joinder likely had the effect of eviscerating Jordan's planned defense to the tax charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The surrender of this privilege was capped by the government's maneuvering that got before the mail fraud jury the allegedly fraudulent tax returns.  The government had made substantial efforts at the original trial seeking to introduce the tax returns as proof of intent.  The court twice ruled that possible prejudice from these forms outweighed their relevance under Fed.R.Evid. 403.  We have here the type of prejudice outlined in Scivola, 766 F.2d at 41-42, that of evidence presented that would not have been admissible at a separate trial.  By the joinder the government has circumvented the court's ruling.  Jury-wise it could be thought better off with evidence that would point in an improper direction tied to an instruction not to so consider it, than not to have it at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have an unusual situation.  With the Fifth Amendment involved should either, both, or neither of the mail fraud, etc. convictions, and tax evasion convictions, be set aside?   There are recognized benefits (to all, except, usually, the defendant) in having joint trials.  Traditionally, defendants may, to an extent, have to stand the cost, the extent to be determined by the court's discretion.  In the second mail fraud trial, by choosing not to take the stand defendant felt only one prejudice, the jury's knowledge of the tax cases.  At the original trial the court, in excluding evidence of those charges, had described it as of minimum value to the government.  While we agree with Jordan that it would have been happier for him not to have had that evidence now get in through the back door by the joinder, we believe it was within the court's discretion, in the absence of a Fifth Amendment problem (such as infected the tax counts), to subject him to the ordinary consequences of joinder of indictments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not to say that Jordan did not endure some loss.  There should be some limit to the harm the government should impose to meet the court's Rule 403 finding in the original action.  By bringing the tax indictment, and joining it with the tax charges to get the tax forms before a mail fraud jury, it put Jordan in the proverbial bind--testify, to your loss in the mail fraud case, or do not testify, to your loss in the tax case.  Jordan had valid Fifth Amendment reasons for disliking both alternatives, and we do not think the government should have it both ways.  We allow one, but it should not complain that we hold it to its original decision of non-joinder.  The convictions and sentences on the tax counts are vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Requirements of a Scheme to Defraud</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Continuing with the mail fraud case, Jordan next argues that the government failed to allege and prove that Pioneer suffered actual harm or that he was unjustly enriched as a result of the fraud as required under the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The government contends that defendant affirmatively waived this ground by requesting a jury instruction on the mail fraud count that did not include any mention of actual harm or unjust enrichment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  We agree.

Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant has also filed a pro se brief.  We do not discuss it here as we find his arguments to be without merit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  His convictions and sentences on Counts I through X of the first indictment are affirmed.  The convictions and sentences on all counts of the second indictment are vacated and this case remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Jordan's offer of proof contained the following assertions:</p>\n        <p>3) It is anticipated that in the tax prosecution the Defendant would testify that he has in the past handled his own tax filings.  He has read various instructions provided by the Internal Revenue Service and has done some independent research regarding tax laws.  George Jordan was of the opinion that funds paid to him from the Pioneer Plastics Workers' Compensation Trust were not taxable pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(9).</p>\n        <p>4) Jordan would testify that upon filing for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, Jordan, upon advice of bankruptcy counsel filed certain forms 1040-X.</p>\n        <p>5) Jordan filed form 1040 for 1992 and receive (sic) a refund check of approximately $1000, and in addition, a form 1040-X regarding the Pine Tree income and exemptions under 501(c)(9) were filed.</p>\n        <p>6) Forms 1040-X were filed for the years 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We emphasize, however, that we do not hold that a defendant's mere assertion of a Cheek defense invariably requires severance of an indictment charging tax and non-tax offenses.  Rather, the court must undertake, on a case-by-case basis, to weigh \" 'the considerations of judicial economy' against the defendant's 'freedom to choose whether to testify.' \"  Alosa, 14 F.3d at 695 (citations omitted)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341 reads in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises ... for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting to do so, places in any post office or authorized depository for mail matter, any matter or thing whatever to be sent to delivered by the Postal Service ... or takes or receives therefrom ... shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years or both.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The jury instruction Jordan requested reads as follows:</p>\n        <p>Intent to Defraud--Defined:</p>\n        <p>To act with an \"intent to defraud\" means to act knowingly and with the intention or purpose to deceive or cheat.

Since the panel is not in agreement as to whether this contention raises an issue of first impression in this circuit, or whether it is foreclosed by Gaunt v.
