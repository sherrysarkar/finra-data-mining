Plaintiffs-appellees\r                                  \r\n\nallege  that  they  were  demoted from  their  positions  as area\r\n\nengineers and  assistant chief of  supply, in violation  of their\r\n\nFirst Amendment right to freedom of association, because of their\r\n\npolitical affiliation  with the  Popular Democratic  Party (PDP).\r\n\nIn June  1994, defendants-appellants  filed a motion  for summary\r\n\njudgment with respect to  the seven plaintiffs who had  been area\r\n\nengineers.  The motion  for summary judgment was premised  on two\r\n\ndifferent  theories.   First, it  alleged that  plaintiffs' First\r\n\nAmendment claim is without merit because political affiliation is\r\n\nan  appropriate requirement  for the  position of  area engineer.\r\n\nSecond,  it  argued  that  co-defendant Cordero  is  entitled  to\r\n\nqualified immunity.  Defendants'  motion for summary judgment was\r\n\ndenied  by the  district court  on March  29, 1996.   Defendants-\r\n\nappellants now  appeal  with respect  to  co-defendant  Cordero's\r\n\nentitlement to  summary judgment on  qualified immunity  grounds.\r\n\nFinding that we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.\r\n\n          Public officials alleged to have committed civil rights\r\n\nviolations  are  entitled  to  raise  the  defense  of  qualified\r\n\nimmunity.    The  defense  is  not  available,  however,  if  the\r\n\nofficial's  conduct violates  a  federal right  that was  clearly\r\n\nestablished  at  the time  of the  infringement.   See  Harlow v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nFitzgerald,  457 U.S.  800, 818-19 (1982);  Stella v.

See  Siegert v.  Gilley, 500  U.S. 226,  232 (1991);\r                                              \r\n\nMitchell v.

In  Johnson, a  plaintiff\r                                                             \r\n\nbrought suit against five police officers, claiming that they had\r\n\nused excessive force in arresting him.  The district court denied\r\n\na  motion  for  summary  judgment based  on  qualified  immunity,\r\n\nfinding that  there were  issues of  material fact  sufficient to\r\n\ndefeat summary judgment.  The Seventh Circuit held that it lacked\r\n\njurisdiction and dismissed the appeal.  The Supreme Court granted\r\n\ncertiorari and held that no appellate jurisdiction exists where a\r\n\ndefendant  appeals a  denial  of summary  judgment  based on  the\r\n\ngrounds that there exist genuine issues of material fact.  Id.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          This court  dealt with  a  similar issue  in Stella  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nKelly.  In Stella,  former members of the Zoning Board of Appeals\r                           \r\n\nfor  the Town of Tewksbury, Massachusetts,  alleged that they had\r\n\nbeen removed  from the board as  a result of votes  they had cast\r\n\nwhile  on the board.   Stella, 63  F.3d at 72-73.   The complaint\r                                       \r\n\nconsisted  of two allegations -- first, that their firing was the\r\n\nresult of their voting patterns and,  second, that this infringed\r\n\na  constitutionally protected free speech right.

Cordero (\"Cordero\"), Executive Director of PREPA.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.  Plaintiffs-appellees allege that they were demoted from their positions as area engineers and assistant chief of supply, in violation of their First Amendment right to freedom of association, because of their political affiliation with the Popular Democratic Party (PDP).  In June 1994, defendants-appellants filed a motion for summary judgment with respect to the seven plaintiffs who had been area engineers.  The motion for summary judgment was premised on two different theories.  First, it alleged that plaintiffs' First Amendment claim is without merit because political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position of area engineer.  Second, it argued that codefendant Cordero is entitled to qualified immunity.  Defendants' motion for summary judgment was denied by the district court on March 29, 1996.  Defendants-appellants now appeal with respect to co-defendant Cordero's entitlement to summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.  Finding that we lack jurisdiction, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Public officials alleged to have committed civil rights violations are entitled to raise the defense of qualified immunity.  The defense is not available, however, if the official's conduct violates a federal right that was clearly established at the time of the infringement.  See Harlow v.

In Johnson, a plaintiff brought suit against five police officers, claiming that they had used excessive force in arresting him.  The district court denied a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity, finding that there were issues of material fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment.  The Seventh Circuit held that it lacked jurisdiction and dismissed the appeal.  The Supreme Court granted certiorari and held that no appellate jurisdiction exists where a defendant appeals a denial of summary judgment based on the grounds that there exist genuine issues of material fact.

In Stella, former members of the Zoning Board of Appeals for the Town of Tewksbury, Massachusetts, alleged that they had been removed from the board as a result of votes they had cast while on the board.  Stella, 63 F.3d at 72-73.   The complaint consisted of two allegations--first, that their firing was the result of their voting patterns and, second, that this infringed a constitutionally protected free speech right.  Id. This court noted that under Johnson:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>a district court's pretrial rejection of a proffered qualified immunity defense remains immediately appealable as a collateral order to the extent that it turns on a pure issue of law....  On the other hand, a district court's pretrial rejection of a qualified immunity defense is not immediately appealable to the extent that it turns on either an issue of fact or an issue perceived by the district court to be an issue of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>*   *   *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>The bottom line, then, is simply this:  a summary judgment order which determines that the pretrial record sets forth a genuine issue of fact, as distinguished from an order that determines whether certain given facts demonstrate, under clearly established law, a violation of some federally protected right, is not reviewable on demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The instant case is controlled by Johnson and Stella.   The district court's Order denying the summary judgment motion reads, in part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>Upon review of the parties' documents, this Court finds that defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  Defendants have not been able to establish the lack of a genuine issue of material fact regarding their discriminatory conduct towards plaintiffs....  [T]his Court believes that defendants' conduct towards plaintiffs, if proven true, could constitute an actionable claim under &#167; 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Order of the District Court, March 29, 1996.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Order leaves little doubt that the district court determined that \"the pretrial record set[ ] forth a genuine issue of fact.\"  Stella, 63 F.3d at 74.   In light of Johnson and Stella, the district court's finding that there exist issues of material fact is sufficient for us to conclude that we lack appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
