Grosso with whom O'Reilly &amp; Grosso, P.C. were on\r\nbrief for appellees.\r\n\nJanuary 15, 1999\r\n\nBOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge. This is an appeal from the\r\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment to plaintiffs-appellees\r\nT. Equipment Corporation and C.R.C. Co., Inc. (Contractors) and its\r\ndenial of defendant-appellant's Massachusetts Laborers' Union\r\nDistrict Council (Laborers) motion for summary judgment.  The case\r\narises from a jurisdictional dispute between Local 24 of the\r\nCarpenters Union (Carpenters) and the Laborers about the allocation\r\nof \"stripping\" work for plaintiffs-contractors.  The issue before\r\nus has not been directly addressed before by this circuit:  What is\r\nthe consequence of an arbitration award for damages to one union\r\n(Laborers) because of the breach of a collective bargaining\r\nagreement by the employers of members of that union in the face of\r\nan NLRB decision under 29 U.S.C.A.  160(k)(10(k)) awarding the\r\nunderlying work to another union (Carpenters)?  The district court\r\nfound that the NLRB  10(k) decision nullified the damages award. \r\nWe affirm.\r\n                              I\r\nThe facts are not in dispute.  The plaintiffs-contractors\r\nwere subcontractors to J.F. White Contracting Company.  White was\r\nthe main contractor for the construction of new railroad stations\r\nand the renovation of railroad bridges to facilitate the extension\r\nof commuter rail service on the Old Colony Railway.  T. Equipment's\r\nsubcontract required bridge repair and structural work on the rail\r\nsystem.  C.R.C.'s subcontractual work entailed building the\r\nsubstructural concrete foundations for the railroad stations.  Both\r\nsubcontracts involved extensive concrete work.  Casting concrete\r\nrequires the use of wood or metal forms into which the concrete is\r\npoured.  After the concrete has hardened sufficiently so that it\r\ncan stand on its own, the forms are \"stripped\" from the concrete\r\nand moved to the site of the next job.\r\nThere was a long-standing collective bargaining agreement\r\nbetween the Massachusetts Contractors Association and the Laborers \r\nto the effect that \"stripping\" would be done jointly by members of\r\nthe Carpenters' and Laborers' Unions.  The latest manifestation of\r\nthis agreement was a letter from the Laborers' Union representative\r\nto J.F. White dated October 7, 1994, stating:  \"It was also agreed\r\nthat the stripping of concrete forms is to be in a manner of equal\r\nnumbers . . . [equal numbers of members of the Carpenters' and\r\nLaborers' Unions].\"\r\nThe portion of the construction project giving rise to\r\nthe work dispute began in May of 1995 and was completed in May of\r\n1996.  The site of the work was a railroad station in Weymouth,\r\nMassachusetts.  The work for Contractor C.R.C. was mainly that of\r\nerecting concrete footings.  Its crew for this work consisted of\r\ntwo carpenters and two laborers.  The carpenters erected forms for\r\nthe footings and stripped the forms from the concrete after it had\r\nhardened.  The laborers cleared and oiled the forms and carried\r\nthem to the next construction point.  On several occasions in June\r\nof 1995 the laborers assisted the carpenters in stripping the\r\nforms.  In late June the Carpenters complained to the C.R.C. labor\r\nforeman that the stripping should be done by the carpenters.  The\r\nLaborers promptly countered that the stripping should be done with\r\nat least fifty percent laborers.\r\nAbout the end of June 1995, C.R.C. began pouring concrete\r\nfor retaining walls which were much larger than the footings it had\r\npreviously constructed.  C.R.C. added two carpenters and two\r\nlaborers to its crew.  The Laborers, through its business manager,\r\ndemanded that C.R.C. officially assign the stripping of forms to a\r\ncrew composed equally of carpenters and laborers.  The same demand\r\nwas made of T. Equipment.  On June 30, 1995, C.R.C. formally\r\nassigned the work of erecting and stripping forms to members of the\r\nCarpenters' Union and the work of cleaning, oiling, and moving the\r\nforms to the next job site to members of the Laborers' Union.\r\nOn the next day of work, July 5, carpenters began to\r\nstrip forms from one retaining wall.  Two members of the Laborers'\r\nUnion climbed the wall and began to assist in the stripping.  The\r\njob foreman for C.R.C. told the laborers to come down from the\r\nwall; they refused to do so.  The carpenters stopped stripping and\r\nrefused to continue.  The police were called and removed the\r\nlaborers from the job site.\r\nOn July 21, 1995, the Laborers filed a contractual\r\ngrievance against both C.R.C. and T. Equipment (plaintiffs in this\r\naction).  The Laborers alleged breach of the collective bargaining\r\nagreement between the Union and the main contractor, J.F. White. \r\nArbitration was requested and an arbitration hearing was scheduled\r\nfor November 14, 1995.  On November 9, the Carpenters informed\r\nC.R.C. and T. Equipment that if the carpenters were removed from\r\nthe stripping work, they would be pulled from the site and the\r\nUnion would no longer refer carpenters to C.R.C. or T. Equipment.\r\nOn the day of the scheduled arbitration hearing, C.R.C.\r\nand T. Equipment filed an unfair labor practice charge with the\r\nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board) against the\r\nCarpenters' Union.  They alleged, in effect, that the Carpenters\r\nhad threatened to refuse to work and engaged in other illegal\r\nactivity because of the stripping dispute.  The Contractors'\r\ncounsel appeared before the arbitrator and took the position that\r\nthe filing of an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB\r\ndeprived the arbitrator of jurisdiction.  This resulted in a delay\r\nof the arbitration proceeding.  The hearing terminated, after two\r\ndays, on July 2, 1996. \r\nThe NLRB proceeded promptly under section 10(k) of the\r\nNational Labor Relations Act to hear the dispute.  On October 30,\r\n1996, it issued its determination:\r\n   After considering all the relevant factors,\r\nwe conclude that employees represented by the\r\nCarpenters are entitled to perform the work in\r\ndispute.  We reach this conclusion relying on\r\nthe factors of collective-bargaining\r\nagreements, company preference and past\r\npractice, relative skills and safety, and\r\neconomy and efficiency of operations.  In\r\nmaking this determination, we are awarding the\r\nwork to employees represented by the\r\nCarpenters, not to that Union or its members. \r\nThe determination is limited to the project\r\nknown as the Old Colony Railway.\r\n\n                   DETERMINATION OF DISPUTE\r\n\n   The National Labor Relations Board makes\r\nthe following Determination of Dispute.\r\n\n   Employees of T. Equipment Corporation and\r\nC.R.C. Co., Inc. represented by Local 624,\r\nUnited Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners\r\nof America, AFL-CIO are entitled to perform\r\nstripping of reusable panel forms on the Old\r\nColony Railway project.\r\n\n   Dated, Washington, D.C.   October 30, 1996\r\n\nThe arbitrator issued his opinion on November 4, 1996. \r\nHe was fully aware of the NLRB's decision; see first paragraph\r\nbelow.  The pertinent parts of the arbitrator's opinion follow.\r\nThe Employers suggest that the 1988 NLRB\r\ndecision in Hawkins should control the\r\nquestion of arbitrability because the\r\ncarpenters were awarded stripping work in \r\n[the NLRB] proceeding.  However, this\r\narbitration arises under the parties'\r\ncollective bargaining agreement and concerns\r\nthe parties' rights and obligations under this\r\ncontract.  My responsibility as arbitrator is\r\nto interpret and apply the parties' Agreement\r\nto the disputed stripping assignment.  It may\r\nalso be significant that the laborers union\r\nseeks an award of damages rather than an award\r\nof work so there should be no direct conflict\r\nbetween this award and the NLRB decision(s). \r\nTherefore, under the clear and unambiguous\r\nlanguage of the Agreement, I must find the\r\ngrievance to be arbitrable.\r\n\nAll of this evidence supports the conclusion\r\nthat the collective bargaining agreement was\r\nintended to have stripping of concrete forms\r\nperformed by a composite crew of carpenters\r\nand laborers.  This did not occur when the\r\nEmployers assigned all actual stripping work\r\nto the carpenters.  Therefore, I find that\r\nthis assignment violated the Agreement.\r\n\nAs remedy, the grievants are entitled to be\r\nmade whole for lost wages and benefits.  At\r\nthe Union's request I will retain jurisdiction\r\nover calculation of the damages for a period\r\nof 120 days should the parties be unable to\r\nagree amongst themselves.\r\n\nPlaintiff-Contractors then sought a vacatur of the\r\narbitration award in the district court, which the district court\r\ngranted.  This appeal followed. \r\n                              II\r\nBefore examining the cases, we think it is advisable to\r\nset forth the section of the statute under which the NLRB initially\r\nproceeds in a work assignment labor dispute between unions.  29\r\nU.S.C.  160(k) (also known as  10(k)) provides:\r\n(k) Hearings on jurisdictional strikes\r\n   Whenever it is charged that any person has\r\nengaged in an unfair labor practice within the\r\nmeaning of paragraph (4)(D) of section 158(b)\r\nof this title, the Board is empowered and \r\ndirected to hear and determine the dispute out\r\nof which such unfair labor practice shall have\r\narisen, unless, within ten days after notice\r\nthat such charge has been filed, the parties\r\nto such dispute submit to the Board\r\nsatisfactory evidence that they have adjusted,\r\nor agreed upon methods for the voluntary\r\nadjustment of, the dispute.  Upon compliance\r\nby the parties to the dispute with the\r\ndecision of the Board or upon such voluntary\r\nadjustment of the dispute, such charge shall\r\nbe dismissed.\r\n\nWe start our analysis of the case law with the relevant\r\nSupreme Court cases.  None of them directly address the issue\r\nbefore us, but they are a necessary part of the framework of our\r\ndecision.\r\nIn National Labor Relations Bd. v. Radio &amp; Television\r\nBroad. Engr's Union, 364 U.S. 573, 579 (1961), the Court held:\r\n   We agree with the Second, Third and Seventh\r\nCircuits that  10(k) requires the Board to\r\ndecide jurisdictional disputes on their merits\r\nand conclude that in this case that\r\nrequirement means that the Board should\r\naffirmatively have decided whether the\r\ntechnicians or the state employees were\r\nentitled to the disputed work.\r\n\nCarey v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 375 U.S. 261 (1964),\r\nis the Supreme Court case closest to ours.  The Court pointed out\r\nthat the Act and its remedies for disputes by labor unions over\r\nwork assignments \"come into play only by a strike or threat of a\r\nstrike.  Such conduct gives the Board authority under  10(k) to\r\nresolve the strike.\"  Id. at 263-64.\r\nThe Court gave its blessing to arbitration:\r\n   Since  10(k) not only tolerates but\r\nactively encourages voluntary settlements of\r\nwork assignment controversies between unions,\r\nwe conclude that grievance procedures pursued\r\nto arbitration further the policies of the\r\nAct.  \r\n\nId. at 266.  Indeed, the Board often stays its own  10(k)\r\nproceeding pending the outcome of an arbitration.  See Carey, 375\r\nU.S. at 271.  The Court discussed the interplay between arbitration\r\nand a Board proceeding:\r\n   If by the time the dispute reaches the\r\nBoard, arbitration has already taken place,\r\nthe Board shows deference to the arbitral\r\naward, provided the procedure was a fair one\r\nand the results were not repugnant to the Act.\r\n\nId. (footnotes omitted).\r\n\nFinally, for our purposes, the Court held:\r\n\n   Should the Board disagree with the arbiter,\r\nby ruling, for example, that the employees\r\ninvolved in the controversy are members of one\r\nbargaining unit or other, the Board's ruling\r\nwould, of course, take precedence; and if the\r\nemployer's action had been in accord with that\r\nruling, it would not be liable for damages\r\nunder  301.\r\n\nId. at 272 (emphasis added).\r\n\nWe end our survey of Supreme Court cases with a quote\r\nsummarizing the history and purpose of  10(k):\r\n   In 1947 Congress responded to the labor\r\nunrest caused by jurisdictional disputes by\r\nadding  8(b)(4)(D) to the National Labor\r\nRelations Act, which made it an unfair labor\r\npractice for a labor organization to induce\r\nthe employees of any employer to strike in the\r\nhopes of forcing an employer to assign\r\nparticular work to employees in a particular\r\nlabor organization.  In the belief that\r\nresolution of jurisdictional disputes was more\r\nimportant to industrial peace than the\r\nimposition of unfair labor practice sanctions,\r\nNLRB v. Radio Engineers, 364 U.S. 573, 576-577\r\n(1961) (hereinafter CBS), Congress at the same\r\ntime enacted  10(k), 29 U.S.C.  160(k), to\r\ninduce unions to settle their differences\r\nwithout awaiting unfair labor practice\r\nproceedings and enforcement of Board orders by\r\ncourts of appeals.\r\n\nInternational Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp. v. Local 134, Int'l Bhd. of  Elec.\r\nWorkers, 419 U.S. 428, 430-31 (1975) (footnotes omitted).\r\nUnfortunately, it is now obvious that the enactment of\r\n10(k) has not met the expectation that it would significantly\r\nreduce unfair labor practice proceedings and enforcement of Board\r\norders by courts of appeals.  It could be argued that the number of\r\ncases in this area has increased because of the tension between\r\narbitration awards and  10(k) determinations.  As the cases\r\nillustrate, the union that loses the arbitration hearing can obtain\r\na  10(k) hearing before the NLRB by committing or threatening to\r\ncommit an unfair labor practice.\r\nOur circuit previously grappled with the arbitration\r\naward    10(k) problem in J.F. White Contracting Co. v. Local 103\r\nInt'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, 890 F.2d 528 (1st Cir. 1989).  The\r\ncase ascended the same procedural ladder as the one now before us. \r\nThe contractor employer gave laborers the right to handle and\r\ninstall precast enclosures for electrical conduits at a\r\nconstruction site.  The electricians initiated arbitration\r\nproceedings and obtained an arbitration award assigning them the\r\nwork.  The employer proceeded before the NLRB which made a  10(k)\r\ndecision that the laborers were entitled to the work.  The employer\r\nthen filed an action in the district court which vacated the\r\narbitration award.  In an opinion written by then Circuit Judge\r\nBreyer (now an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme\r\nCourt), we affirmed.  The court held that under well-established\r\nlaw \"courts are not to enforce an arbitration award that conflicts\r\nwith a  10(k) determination.\"  Id. at 529 (citations omitted).  We\r\nfound that the conflict between the arbitration award and the\r\n10(k) determination was \"plain.\"  Id.\r\nIn the decision, Judge Breyer discussed cases where\r\ncourts of appeals had refused to vacate an arbitration award\r\ndespite a claim by one party that it conflicted with an NLRB\r\ndecision.  He gave particular attention to Hutter Constr. Co. v.\r\nInternational Union of Operating Eng'rs, Local 139, 862 F.2d 641\r\n(7th Cir. 1988).  Because Hutter is one of the main cases relied\r\nupon by appellant Laborers, we quote Judge Breyer's treatment of\r\nit, albeit it is dictum.\r\nA construction company signed a multiparty\r\nagreement in which it promised forklifting\r\nwork to employees called \"Operators\" and also\r\npromised not to subcontract forklifting work\r\nto any contractor who was not a party to the\r\nagreement.  The company then broke the latter\r\npromise by subcontracting forklifting work to\r\na nonsigning firm, and that subcontractor, in\r\nturn, gave the work to Laborers rather than to\r\nOperators.  After strike activity led to a\r\n 10(k) hearing, (1) the NLRB told the\r\nsubcontractor to assign the work to Laborers,\r\nand (2) arbitrators found the company had\r\nbroken its \"no subcontracting to nonsigners\"\r\npromise and awarded the Operators back pay. \r\nWe can understand how a court might have found\r\nno significant conflict on these facts, for\r\nthe company could obey the arbitrators' award\r\nwithout interfering with the subcontractor's\r\nduty to assign forklifting work to Laborers. \r\nIn our case, however, White Co. cannot abide\r\nby its agreement with the Electrical Workers\r\n(as construed by the arbitrators) without also\r\nviolating the NLRB's order to assign the\r\ndisputed work to the Laborers.  Consequently,\r\nthe facts of this case show a far more direct\r\nand serious conflict than those in Hutter and\r\nthe other cases cited above.\r\n\nId. at 530 (emphasis added).  \r\n\nJudge Breyer also clarified the role of  10(k) in NLRB\r\nproceedings.\r\nN.L.R.B. determinations under section 10(k)\r\nare not directly reviewable in this or any\r\nother court. . . .  To obtain review of such a\r\ndecision, a party must fail to comply, thereby\r\nprecipitating an \"unfair labor practice\"\r\nproceeding in which the  10(k) award becomes\r\nimportant evidence.  When that proceeding\r\nculminates, as it must, in a final order, the\r\ndisappointed party can bring the order into\r\ncourt and challenge the underlying  10(k)\r\ndetermination.\r\n\nId. at 530-31 (citations omitted).  \r\nThe Supreme Court precedents and this circuit's case of\r\nJ.F. White Contracting Co., 890 F.2d 528, establish that a  10(k)\r\ndecision trumps an arbitrator's award if the two conflict.  Neither\r\nthe Supreme Court nor this circuit has addressed whether a  10(k)\r\ndecision should nullify an arbitrator's award when the arbitrator\r\nawards damages to one union and the  10(k) decision allocates the\r\nwork to the other union.\r\nAlthough it is clear that a  10(k) decision will trump\r\nan arbitrator's award in a case of conflict, the circuits are not\r\nin agreement as to what constitutes such a conflict.  The appellant\r\nhere argues that its arbitration award does not conflict with the\r\n10(k) decision because the arbitrator only awarded money damages\r\nto the Laborers, whereas the Board only awarded the disputed work\r\nto the Carpenters.  The leading case on which the appellant relies\r\nfor this position is Hutter, 862 F.2d 641.\r\nIn Hutter, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district\r\ncourt's approval of an arbitrator's decision awarding the\r\nOperators' Union damages for Hutter Construction Company's breach\r\nof a collective bargaining agreement despite the fact that the NLRB\r\nin a  10(k) determination ruled that the other union, Laborers,\r\nshould be assigned the work.\r\nThe court acknowledged that when an arbitration award\r\nconflicts with an NLRB decision, the NLRB decision takes\r\nprecedence.  The court concluded, however, that the arbitrator's\r\naward and the NLRB determination were consistent remedies.  The\r\ncourt reasoned as follows:\r\nThe NLRB's task and frame of reference at the\r\n 10(k) hearing was far different from the\r\narbitrator's.  The Board had to determine the\r\nrelative merit of the Operators' claim to the\r\nforklift work when compared with the claims of\r\nanother union, not the merits of the\r\nOperators' claim against Hutter.\r\n\nId. at 645.\r\nThe Seventh Circuit re-affirmed Hutter in Miron Constr.\r\nCo., Inc. v. International Union of Operating Eng'rs, Local 139, 44\r\nF.3d 558 (7th Cir. 1995). \r\nThe Ninth Circuit discussed the interplay between an\r\narbitration award and a  10(k) determination in Sea-Land Serv.,\r\nInc. v. International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union,\r\nLocals 13, 63, and 94, 939 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991).  It concluded:\r\nThe NLRB, at least in its jurisdictional\r\ndispute-resolution capacity, is simply not an\r\narbiter of collective bargaining agreement\r\ndisputes.  To allow the NLRB to supersede\r\narbitration awards beyond what is needed to\r\nresolve the specific jurisdictional dispute at\r\nissue would undermine Congress's intent\r\nregarding the role of arbitration.  See Carey v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 375 U.S. 261,\r\n265, 84 S. Ct. 401, 405-06, 11 L. Ed. 2d 320\r\n(1964) (\"The underlying objective of the\r\nnational labor laws is to promote collective\r\nbargaining agreements and to help give\r\nsubstance to such agreements through the\r\narbitration process.\") (quotation omitted). \r\nAn NLRB 10(k) determination takes precedence\r\nover an arbitration award, but only to the\r\nextent necessary to effectuate the 10(k)\r\ndetermination.\r\n\nId. at 873.\r\nDespite the support Hutter and Sea-Land Serv. may provide\r\nfor the appellant's position, there is another line of cases\r\nholding that a  10(k) determination awarding work to one union\r\nconflicts with an arbitration award in favor of another union,\r\nregardless of whether the arbitrator's award is couched in terms of\r\ndamages or work assignment.  Thus, even in situations materially\r\nindistinguishable from the instant one, these cases hold that the\r\n10(k) decision nullifies the arbitration award.\r\nThe Third Circuit trenchantly explained this approach in Local 30, United Slate, Tile and Composition Roofers, Damp and\r\nWaterproof Workers Ass'n, AFL-CIO v. National Labor Relations Bd., \r\n1 F.3d 1419 (3d Cir. 1993).  In this case the employer (Gundle)\r\nfiled an unfair labor practice charge against the Union.  The NLRB\r\nissued a complaint against the Union alleging that picketing and \r\nthe Union's continued maintenance of its suit to enforce the\r\narbitration award, which had awarded the Union damages against the\r\nemployer, constituted an unfair labor practice.\r\nThe Third Circuit upheld the NLRB, holding there was\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the NLRB's finding that the Union\r\npicketing had an unlawful objective and that, under the National\r\nLabor Relations Act, maintenance of a suit to enforce the\r\narbitration award for pay-in-lieu of work was an unfair labor\r\npractice.\r\nIn the course of its opinion, the court held, \"The\r\ndistinction Local 30 seeks to draw between seeking the work and\r\nseeking payment for the work is ephemeral.\"  Id. at 1427.  \r\nAs support for this finding, it stated:\r\nAny other result would be inconsistent with\r\nCarey v. Westinghouse Electric Corp., 375 U.S.\r\n261, 268, 84 S. Ct. 401, 407, 11 L. Ed. 2d 320\r\n(1964), where the Supreme Court held that a\r\nBoard ruling on a representational issue would\r\nprotect the employer from liability for\r\ndamages for breach of a collective bargaining\r\nagreement as long as the employer's actions\r\nwere consistent with the Board's decision.\r\n\nId. at 1427.\r\n\nThe Third Circuit considered and expressly rejected\r\nHutter, in clear and unmistakable language:\r\n   Whether or not the holding in Hutter is\r\ndistinguishable from the issue presented here,\r\nas the Board suggests, we do not accept the\r\ndistinction made in that case between a\r\nsection 10(k) award based on noncontractual\r\nfactors and an arbitral award of damages based\r\non a contractual claim to the work. \r\n\n  . . . .\r\n\n   We also agree with the Board that if a\r\nunion is permitted to recover damages for work\r\nawarded to another union in a section 10(k)\r\nproceeding, the policy underlying section\r\n8(b)(4)(ii)(D) of protecting employers from\r\nthe detrimental economic impact of\r\njurisdictional disputes would be severely\r\nundermined.\r\n\nLocal 30 etc., 1 F.3d at 1428.\r\n\nThe Third Circuit reaffirmed its position in United Union\r\nof Roofers, Waterproofers and Allied Workers, Local Union No. 30 v.\r\nGundle Lining Constr. Corp., 1 F.3d 1429, 1430 (3d Cir. 1993).  It\r\nstated tersely:  \"We declined to adopt the distinction proposed by\r\nLocal 30 between seeking payment for work and seeking the work\r\nitself.\"  Id.\r\nIn language which the district court here partially\r\nadopted, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit held:\r\nWe think the section 10(k) award trumps the\r\ncollective bargaining agreement.  The Supreme\r\nCourt long ago, in Carey v. Westinghouse Elec.\r\nCorp., 375 U.S. 261 (1964), held that a union\r\ncould file a grievance and compel arbitration\r\nof a dispute with a contracting employer even\r\nif the dispute was jurisdictional.  If the\r\ndispute continued after arbitration and caused\r\na section 8(b)(4)(D) charge (no such charge\r\nwas brought in Westinghouse), the Board could\r\ngive the arbitrator's award that weight it\r\nthought appropriate.  However, \"[s]hould the\r\nBoard disagree with the arbiter . . . the\r\nBoard's ruling would, of course, take\r\nprecedence. . . .  The superior authority of\r\nthe Board may be invoked at any time.\"  Id. at\r\n272.\r\n\nInternational Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union v. National\r\nLabor Relations Bd., 884 F.2d 1407, 1413 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (emphasis\r\nadded).\r\nThe Sixth Circuit in International Union, United Auto.,\r\nAerospace and Agric. Implement Workers (UAW) and its Local 1519 v.\r\nRockwell Int'l Corp., 619 F.2d 580 (6th Cir. 1980), has also held,\r\nin an analogous situation, that an arbitrator's award must give way\r\nto an NLRB determination.\r\nWe agree with the district court's holding\r\nthat when an employer has been acting in\r\naccord with an ultimate NLRB  10(k) ruling,\r\nit is not liable for damages to the\r\ndisappointed union.\r\n\nId. at 584.\r\nWe have referred to the important cases setting forth the\r\nopposing points of view on the issue before us.  We are also\r\ncognizant of the criticism by labor law observers that the NLRB's\r\nwork award in virtually every case coincides with the employer's\r\npreference.  See N.L.R.B. v. International Longshoremen's and\r\nWarehousemen's Local No. 50, 504 F.2d 1209, 1220 (9th Cir. 1974), \r\nin which the Ninth Circuit stated:\r\n   Most observers who have systematically\r\nstudied the Board's  10(k) decisions agree\r\nthat the Board's statement that no factor is\r\nnecessarily more important than any other is\r\nsimply false.  Our own independent review of\r\nthe Board's  10(k) decisions reveals that the\r\ncommentators are correct in concluding that\r\nthe Board's work award coincides 'in virtually\r\nevery case' with the employer's preference. \r\n[FN 7]\r\n\nWe think it necessary to quote footnote 7, which cites to the\r\nstudies made.\r\n   C. Morris, The Developing Labor Law, 1972\r\nSupplement at 136 (1972).  This is a\r\nconsistent occurrence despite the Board's\r\nprotestations that employer preference is only\r\none factor among the many to be considered. \r\nSee Local 38, IBEW (Cleveland Illuminating\r\nCo.), 137 N.L.R.B. 1719, 1722 (1962).  Every\r\nsurvey undertaken of Board  10(k) decisions\r\nbears out this conclusion.  See Atleson,\r\nsupra, note 6 at 117, 151-52; Collister,\r\nsupra, note 5 at 57-58; Gitlow, Technology and\r\nNLRB Decisions in Bargaining Unit and\r\nJurisdictional Dispute Cases, 16 Lab.

The NLRB  10(k) decision here issued prior to the\r\narbitrator's award.  We think this significant because of the\r\nBoard's duty to consider an arbitration award in its  10(k)\r\ndetermination.  See Carey v. Westinghouse Corp., 375 U.S. at 270-\r\n71.  In the case at bar, no arbitration award had been made prior\r\nto the time the Board issued its determination.  Although the Board\r\npresumably knew that arbitration was in process and could have\r\ndeferred its decision until the award was made, its primary duty\r\nunder  10(k) was to bring the jurisdictional dispute to an end as\r\nsoon as reasonably possible.  See N.L.R.B. v. Radio and Television\r\nBroad. Eng'rs Union, 364 U.S. at 579.  We cannot fault the Board\r\nfor acting promptly under the Supreme Court mandate that the Board\r\nmust decide under  10(k) which union members were entitled to the\r\ndisputed work.  The Board did not have the arbitrator's award\r\nbefore it for consideration.\r\nAnother factor that compels our final determination is\r\nthat the arbitration award for damages seems to mean that the\r\nLaborers are entitled to damages for the balance of the work on the\r\nentire project.  It states:\r\nAll of this evidence  supports the conclusion\r\nthat the collective bargaining agreement was\r\nintended to have stripping of concrete forms\r\nperformed by a composite crew of carpenters\r\nand laborers.  This did not occur when the\r\nEmployers assigned all actual stripping work\r\nto the carpenters.  Therefore, I find that\r\nthis assignment violated the Agreement.\r\n\nAs remedy, the grievants are entitled to be\r\nmade whole for lost wages and benefits.  At\r\nthe Union's request I will retain jurisdiction\r\nover calculation of the damages for a period\r\nof 120 days should the parties be unable to\r\nagree amongst themselves.\r\n\nThe award is not limited to the work on the particular\r\nportion of the project where the dispute erupted.  As we read the\r\ndistrict court's opinion it proceeded on the assumption that the\r\ndamages award covered the work to be done on the entire project\r\n(i.e., The Old Colony Railway).  The Contractors-Employers would be\r\npaying a high price for settling a labor dispute which the  10(k)\r\ndecision was designed to accomplish without the employer paying\r\ntribute.  This is contrary to the dictates of Carey v. Westinghouse\r\nCorp., 375 U.S. at 272, where the Court held that \"[s]hould the\r\nBoard disagree with the arbiter, . . . the Board's ruling would of\r\ncourse, take precedence; and if the employer's action had been in\r\naccord with that ruling, it would not be liable for damages under\r\n301.\"\r\nWe acknowledge that the Court has tried to reconcile\r\narbitration awards with  10(k) decisions in jurisdictional labor\r\ndisputes.  See Carey, 375 U.S. at 263-64, 266.  There are\r\nsituations, however, and this is one, where arbitration and  10(k)\r\ndecisions clash.  We agree with the Third Circuit that there can be\r\nno logical distinction between \"seeking the work and seeking\r\npayment for the work.\"  Local 30, United Slate, Tile &amp; Comp.\r\nRoofers v. N.L.R.B., 1 F.3d at 1427.\r\nWe affirm the judgment of the district court. \n",

(Contractors) and its\r\ndenial of defendant-appellant's Massachusetts Laborers' Union\r\nDistrict Council (Laborers) motion for summary judgment.  The case\r\narises from a jurisdictional dispute between Local 24 of the\r\nCarpenters Union (Carpenters) and the Laborers about the allocation\r\nof \"stripping\" work for plaintiffs-contractors.  The issue before\r\nus has not been directly addressed before by this circuit:  What is\r\nthe consequence of an arbitration award for damages to one union\r\n(Laborers) because of the breach of a collective bargaining\r\nagreement by the employers of members of that union in the face of\r\nan NLRB decision under 29 U.S.C.A.  160(k)(10(k)) awarding the\r\nunderlying work to another union (Carpenters)?  The district court\r\nfound that the NLRB  10(k) decision nullified the damages award. \r\nWe affirm.\r\n                              I\r\nThe facts are not in dispute.  The plaintiffs-contractors\r\nwere subcontractors to J.F. White Contracting Company.  White was\r\nthe main contractor for the construction of new railroad stations\r\nand the renovation of railroad bridges to facilitate the extension\r\nof commuter rail service on the Old Colony Railway.  T. Equipment's\r\nsubcontract required bridge repair and structural work on the rail\r\nsystem.  C.R.C.'s subcontractual work entailed building the\r\nsubstructural concrete foundations for the railroad stations.  Both\r\nsubcontracts involved extensive concrete work.  Casting concrete\r\nrequires the use of wood or metal forms into which the concrete is\r\npoured.  After the concrete has hardened sufficiently so that it\r\ncan stand on its own, the forms are \"stripped\" from the concrete\r\nand moved to the site of the next job.\r\nThere was a long-standing collective bargaining agreement\r\nbetween the Massachusetts Contractors Association and the Laborers \r\nto the effect that \"stripping\" would be done jointly by members of\r\nthe Carpenters' and Laborers' Unions.  The latest manifestation of\r\nthis agreement was a letter from the Laborers' Union representative\r\nto J.F. White dated October 7, 1994, stating:  \"It was also agreed\r\nthat the stripping of concrete forms is to be in a manner of equal\r\nnumbers . . . [equal numbers of members of the Carpenters' and\r\nLaborers' Unions].\"\r\nThe portion of the construction project giving rise to\r\nthe work dispute began in May of 1995 and was completed in May of\r\n1996.  The site of the work was a railroad station in Weymouth,\r\nMassachusetts.  The work for Contractor C.R.C. was mainly that of\r\nerecting concrete footings.  Its crew for this work consisted of\r\ntwo carpenters and two laborers.  The carpenters erected forms for\r\nthe footings and stripped the forms from the concrete after it had\r\nhardened.  The laborers cleared and oiled the forms and carried\r\nthem to the next construction point.  On several occasions in June\r\nof 1995 the laborers assisted the carpenters in stripping the\r\nforms.  In late June the Carpenters complained to the C.R.C. labor\r\nforeman that the stripping should be done by the carpenters.  The\r\nLaborers promptly countered that the stripping should be done with\r\nat least fifty percent laborers.\r\nAbout the end of June 1995, C.R.C. began pouring concrete\r\nfor retaining walls which were much larger than the footings it had\r\npreviously constructed.  C.R.C. added two carpenters and two\r\nlaborers to its crew.  The Laborers, through its business manager,\r\ndemanded that C.R.C. officially assign the stripping of forms to a\r\ncrew composed equally of carpenters and laborers.  The same demand\r\nwas made of T. Equipment.  On June 30, 1995, C.R.C. formally\r\nassigned the work of erecting and stripping forms to members of the\r\nCarpenters' Union and the work of cleaning, oiling, and moving the\r\nforms to the next job site to members of the Laborers' Union.\r\nOn the next day of work, July 5, carpenters began to\r\nstrip forms from one retaining wall.  Two members of the Laborers'\r\nUnion climbed the wall and began to assist in the stripping.  The\r\njob foreman for C.R.C. told the laborers to come down from the\r\nwall; they refused to do so.  The carpenters stopped stripping and\r\nrefused to continue.  The police were called and removed the\r\nlaborers from the job site.\r\nOn July 21, 1995, the Laborers filed a contractual\r\ngrievance against both C.R.C. and T. Equipment (plaintiffs in this\r\naction).  The Laborers alleged breach of the collective bargaining\r\nagreement between the Union and the main contractor, J.F. White. \r\nArbitration was requested and an arbitration hearing was scheduled\r\nfor November 14, 1995.  On November 9, the Carpenters informed\r\nC.R.C. and T. Equipment that if the carpenters were removed from\r\nthe stripping work, they would be pulled from the site and the\r\nUnion would no longer refer carpenters to C.R.C. or T. Equipment.\r\nOn the day of the scheduled arbitration hearing, C.R.C.\r\nand T. Equipment filed an unfair labor practice charge with the\r\nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board) against the\r\nCarpenters' Union.  They alleged, in effect, that the Carpenters\r\nhad threatened to refuse to work and engaged in other illegal\r\nactivity because of the stripping dispute.  The Contractors'\r\ncounsel appeared before the arbitrator and took the position that\r\nthe filing of an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB\r\ndeprived the arbitrator of jurisdiction.  This resulted in a delay\r\nof the arbitration proceeding.  The hearing terminated, after two\r\ndays, on July 2, 1996. \r\nThe NLRB proceeded promptly under section 10(k) of the\r\nNational Labor Relations Act to hear the dispute.  On October 30,\r\n1996, it issued its determination:\r\n   After considering all the relevant factors,\r\nwe conclude that employees represented by the\r\nCarpenters are entitled to perform the work in\r\ndispute.  We reach this conclusion relying on\r\nthe factors of collective-bargaining\r\nagreements, company preference and past\r\npractice, relative skills and safety, and\r\neconomy and efficiency of operations.  In\r\nmaking this determination, we are awarding the\r\nwork to employees represented by the\r\nCarpenters, not to that Union or its members. \r\nThe determination is limited to the project\r\nknown as the Old Colony Railway.\r\n\n                   DETERMINATION OF DISPUTE\r\n\n   The National Labor Relations Board makes\r\nthe following Determination of Dispute.\r\n\n   Employees of T. Equipment Corporation and\r\nC.R.C. Co., Inc. represented by Local 624,\r\nUnited Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners\r\nof America, AFL-CIO are entitled to perform\r\nstripping of reusable panel forms on the Old\r\nColony Railway project.\r\n\n   Dated, Washington, D.C.   October 30, 1996\r\n\nThe arbitrator issued his opinion on November 4, 1996. \r\nHe was fully aware of the NLRB's decision; see first paragraph\r\nbelow.  The pertinent parts of the arbitrator's opinion follow.\r\nThe Employers suggest that the 1988 NLRB\r\ndecision in Hawkins should control the\r\nquestion of arbitrability because the\r\ncarpenters were awarded stripping work in \r\n[the NLRB] proceeding.  However, this\r\narbitration arises under the parties'\r\ncollective bargaining agreement and concerns\r\nthe parties' rights and obligations under this\r\ncontract.  My responsibility as arbitrator is\r\nto interpret and apply the parties' Agreement\r\nto the disputed stripping assignment.  It may\r\nalso be significant that the laborers union\r\nseeks an award of damages rather than an award\r\nof work so there should be no direct conflict\r\nbetween this award and the NLRB decision(s). \r\nTherefore, under the clear and unambiguous\r\nlanguage of the Agreement, I must find the\r\ngrievance to be arbitrable.\r\n\nAll of this evidence supports the conclusion\r\nthat the collective bargaining agreement was\r\nintended to have stripping of concrete forms\r\nperformed by a composite crew of carpenters\r\nand laborers.  This did not occur when the\r\nEmployers assigned all actual stripping work\r\nto the carpenters.  Therefore, I find that\r\nthis assignment violated the Agreement.\r\n\nAs remedy, the grievants are entitled to be\r\nmade whole for lost wages and benefits.  At\r\nthe Union's request I will retain jurisdiction\r\nover calculation of the damages for a period\r\nof 120 days should the parties be unable to\r\nagree amongst themselves.\r\n\nPlaintiff-Contractors then sought a vacatur of the\r\narbitration award in the district court, which the district court\r\ngranted.  This appeal followed. \r\n                              II\r\nBefore examining the cases, we think it is advisable to\r\nset forth the section of the statute under which the NLRB initially\r\nproceeds in a work assignment labor dispute between unions.  29\r\nU.S.C.  160(k) (also known as  10(k)) provides:\r\n(k) Hearings on jurisdictional strikes\r\n   Whenever it is charged that any person has\r\nengaged in an unfair labor practice within the\r\nmeaning of paragraph (4)(D) of section 158(b)\r\nof this title, the Board is empowered and \r\ndirected to hear and determine the dispute out\r\nof which such unfair labor practice shall have\r\narisen, unless, within ten days after notice\r\nthat such charge has been filed, the parties\r\nto such dispute submit to the Board\r\nsatisfactory evidence that they have adjusted,\r\nor agreed upon methods for the voluntary\r\nadjustment of, the dispute.  Upon compliance\r\nby the parties to the dispute with the\r\ndecision of the Board or upon such voluntary\r\nadjustment of the dispute, such charge shall\r\nbe dismissed.\r\n\nWe start our analysis of the case law with the relevant\r\nSupreme Court cases.  None of them directly address the issue\r\nbefore us, but they are a necessary part of the framework of our\r\ndecision.\r\nIn National Labor Relations Bd. v. Radio &amp; Television\r\nBroad. Engr's Union, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106151\"><a href=\"/opinion/106151/nlrb-v-radio-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579 (1961), the Court held:\r\n   We agree with the Second, Third and Seventh\r\nCircuits that  10(k) requires the Board to\r\ndecide jurisdictional disputes on their merits\r\nand conclude that in this case that\r\nrequirement means that the Board should\r\naffirmatively have decided whether the\r\ntechnicians or the state employees were\r\nentitled to the disputed work.\r\n\nCarey v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106718\"><a href=\"/opinion/106718/carey-v-westinghouse-elec-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1964),\r\nis the Supreme Court case closest to ours.  The Court pointed out\r\nthat the Act and its remedies for disputes by labor unions over\r\nwork assignments \"come into play only by a strike or threat of a\r\nstrike.  Such conduct gives the Board authority under  10(k) to\r\nresolve the strike.\"  Id. at 263-64.\r\nThe Court gave its blessing to arbitration:\r\n   Since  10(k) not only tolerates but\r\nactively encourages voluntary settlements of\r\nwork assignment controversies between unions,\r\nwe conclude that grievance procedures pursued\r\nto arbitration further the policies of the\r\nAct.  \r\n\nId. at 266.  Indeed, the Board often stays its own  10(k)\r\nproceeding pending the outcome of an arbitration.  See Carey, 375\r\nU.S. at 271.  The Court discussed the interplay between arbitration\r\nand a Board proceeding:\r\n   If by the time the dispute reaches the\r\nBoard, arbitration has already taken place,\r\nthe Board shows deference to the arbitral\r\naward, provided the procedure was a fair one\r\nand the results were not repugnant to the Act.\r\n\nId. (footnotes omitted).\r\n\nFinally, for our purposes, the Court held:\r\n\n   Should the Board disagree with the arbiter,\r\nby ruling, for example, that the employees\r\ninvolved in the controversy are members of one\r\nbargaining unit or other, the Board's ruling\r\nwould, of course, take precedence; and if the\r\nemployer's action had been in accord with that\r\nruling, it would not be liable for damages\r\nunder  301.\r\n\nId. at 272 (emphasis added).\r\n\nWe end our survey of Supreme Court cases with a quote\r\nsummarizing the history and purpose of  10(k):\r\n   In 1947 Congress responded to the labor\r\nunrest caused by jurisdictional disputes by\r\nadding  8(b)(4)(D) to the National Labor\r\nRelations Act, which made it an unfair labor\r\npractice for a labor organization to induce\r\nthe employees of any employer to strike in the\r\nhopes of forcing an employer to assign\r\nparticular work to employees in a particular\r\nlabor organization.  In the belief that\r\nresolution of jurisdictional disputes was more\r\nimportant to industrial peace than the\r\nimposition of unfair labor practice sanctions,\r\nNLRB v. Radio Engineers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106151\"><a href=\"/opinion/106151/nlrb-v-radio-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576-577\r\n(1961) (hereinafter CBS), Congress at the same\r\ntime enacted  10(k), 29 U.S.C.  160(k), to\r\ninduce unions to settle their differences\r\nwithout awaiting unfair labor practice\r\nproceedings and enforcement of Board orders by\r\ncourts of appeals.\r\n\nInternational Tel. &amp; Tel.

It could be argued that the number of\r\ncases in this area has increased because of the tension between\r\narbitration awards and  10(k) determinations.  As the cases\r\nillustrate, the union that loses the arbitration hearing can obtain\r\na  10(k) hearing before the NLRB by committing or threatening to\r\ncommit an unfair labor practice.\r\nOur circuit previously grappled with the arbitration\r\naward    10(k) problem in J.F. White Contracting Co. v. Local 103\r\nInt'l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532751\"><a href=\"/opinion/532751/jf-white-contracting-company-v-local-103-international-brotherhood-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1989).  The\r\ncase ascended the same procedural ladder as the one now before us. \r\nThe contractor employer gave laborers the right to handle and\r\ninstall precast enclosures for electrical conduits at a\r\nconstruction site.  The electricians initiated arbitration\r\nproceedings and obtained an arbitration award assigning them the\r\nwork.  The employer proceeded before the NLRB which made a  10(k)\r\ndecision that the laborers were entitled to the work.  The employer\r\nthen filed an action in the district court which vacated the\r\narbitration award.  In an opinion written by then Circuit Judge\r\nBreyer (now an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme\r\nCourt), we affirmed.  The court held that under well-established\r\nlaw \"courts are not to enforce an arbitration award that conflicts\r\nwith a  10(k) determination.\"  Id. at 529 (citations omitted).  We\r\nfound that the conflict between the arbitration award and the\r\n10(k) determination was \"plain.\"  Id.\r\nIn the decision, Judge Breyer discussed cases where\r\ncourts of appeals had refused to vacate an arbitration award\r\ndespite a claim by one party that it conflicted with an NLRB\r\ndecision.

Because Hutter is one of the main cases relied\r\nupon by appellant Laborers, we quote Judge Breyer's treatment of\r\nit, albeit it is dictum.\r\nA construction company signed a multiparty\r\nagreement in which it promised forklifting\r\nwork to employees called \"Operators\" and also\r\npromised not to subcontract forklifting work\r\nto any contractor who was not a party to the\r\nagreement.  The company then broke the latter\r\npromise by subcontracting forklifting work to\r\na nonsigning firm, and that subcontractor, in\r\nturn, gave the work to Laborers rather than to\r\nOperators.  After strike activity led to a\r\n 10(k) hearing, (1) the NLRB told the\r\nsubcontractor to assign the work to Laborers,\r\nand (2) arbitrators found the company had\r\nbroken its \"no subcontracting to nonsigners\"\r\npromise and awarded the Operators back pay. \r\nWe can understand how a court might have found\r\nno significant conflict on these facts, for\r\nthe company could obey the arbitrators' award\r\nwithout interfering with the subcontractor's\r\nduty to assign forklifting work to Laborers. \r\nIn our case, however, White Co. cannot abide\r\nby its agreement with the Electrical Workers\r\n(as construed by the arbitrators) without also\r\nviolating the NLRB's order to assign the\r\ndisputed work to the Laborers.  Consequently,\r\nthe facts of this case show a far more direct\r\nand serious conflict than those in Hutter and\r\nthe other cases cited above.\r\n\nId. at 530 (emphasis added).  \r\n\nJudge Breyer also clarified the role of  10(k) in NLRB\r\nproceedings.\r\nN.L.R.B. determinations under section 10(k)\r\nare not directly reviewable in this or any\r\nother court. . . .  To obtain review of such a\r\ndecision, a party must fail to comply, thereby\r\nprecipitating an \"unfair labor practice\"\r\nproceeding in which the  10(k) award becomes\r\nimportant evidence.  When that proceeding\r\nculminates, as it must, in a final order, the\r\ndisappointed party can bring the order into\r\ncourt and challenge the underlying  10(k)\r\ndetermination.\r\n\nId. at 530-31 (citations omitted).  \r\nThe Supreme Court precedents and this circuit's case of\r\nJ.F. White Contracting Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532751\"><a href=\"/opinion/532751/jf-white-contracting-company-v-local-103-international-brotherhood-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, establish that a  10(k)\r\ndecision trumps an arbitrator's award if the two conflict.  Neither\r\nthe Supreme Court nor this circuit has addressed whether a  10(k)\r\ndecision should nullify an arbitrator's award when the arbitrator\r\nawards damages to one union and the  10(k) decision allocates the\r\nwork to the other union.\r\nAlthough it is clear that a  10(k) decision will trump\r\nan arbitrator's award in a case of conflict, the circuits are not\r\nin agreement as to what constitutes such a conflict.  The appellant\r\nhere argues that its arbitration award does not conflict with the\r\n10(k) decision because the arbitrator only awarded money damages\r\nto the Laborers, whereas the Board only awarded the disputed work\r\nto the Carpenters.  The leading case on which the appellant relies\r\nfor this position is Hutter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515214\"><a href=\"/opinion/515214/hutter-construction-co-and-wisconsin-laborers-district-council-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\r\nIn Hutter, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the district\r\ncourt's approval of an arbitrator's decision awarding the\r\nOperators' Union damages for Hutter Construction Company's breach\r\nof a collective bargaining agreement despite the fact that the NLRB\r\nin a  10(k) determination ruled that the other union, Laborers,\r\nshould be assigned the work.\r\nThe court acknowledged that when an arbitration award\r\nconflicts with an NLRB decision, the NLRB decision takes\r\nprecedence.  The court concluded, however, that the arbitrator's\r\naward and the NLRB determination were consistent remedies.  The\r\ncourt reasoned as follows:\r\nThe NLRB's task and frame of reference at the\r\n 10(k) hearing was far different from the\r\narbitrator's.  The Board had to determine the\r\nrelative merit of the Operators' claim to the\r\nforklift work when compared with the claims of\r\nanother union, not the merits of the\r\nOperators' claim against Hutter.\r\n\nId. at 645.\r\nThe Seventh Circuit re-affirmed Hutter in Miron Constr.\r\nCo., Inc. v. International Union of Operating Eng'rs, Local 139, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686502\"><a href=\"/opinion/686502/miron-construction-co-inc-v-international-union-of-operating-engineers/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 1995). \r\nThe Ninth Circuit discussed the interplay between an\r\narbitration award and a  10(k) determination in Sea-Land Serv.,\r\nInc. v.

Thus, even in situations materially\r\nindistinguishable from the instant one, these cases hold that the\r\n10(k) decision nullifies the arbitration award.\r\nThe Third Circuit trenchantly explained this approach in Local 30, United Slate, Tile and Composition Roofers, Damp and\r\nWaterproof Workers Ass'n, AFL-CIO v.

The NLRB\r\nissued a complaint against the Union alleging that picketing and \r\nthe Union's continued maintenance of its suit to enforce the\r\narbitration award, which had awarded the Union damages against the\r\nemployer, constituted an unfair labor practice.\r\nThe Third Circuit upheld the NLRB, holding there was\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the NLRB's finding that the Union\r\npicketing had an unlawful objective and that, under the National\r\nLabor Relations Act, maintenance of a suit to enforce the\r\narbitration award for pay-in-lieu of work was an unfair labor\r\npractice.\r\nIn the course of its opinion, the court held, \"The\r\ndistinction Local 30 seeks to draw between seeking the work and\r\nseeking payment for the work is ephemeral.\"  Id. at 1427.  \r\nAs support for this finding, it stated:\r\nAny other result would be inconsistent with\r\nCarey v.

We are also\r\ncognizant of the criticism by labor law observers that the NLRB's\r\nwork award in virtually every case coincides with the employer's\r\npreference.  See N.L.R.B. v.

Our own independent review of\r\nthe Board's  10(k) decisions reveals that the\r\ncommentators are correct in concluding that\r\nthe Board's work award coincides 'in virtually\r\nevery case' with the employer's preference. \r\n[FN 7]\r\n\nWe think it necessary to quote footnote 7, which cites to the\r\nstudies made.\r\n   C. Morris, The Developing Labor Law, 1972\r\nSupplement at 136 (1972).  This is a\r\nconsistent occurrence despite the Board's\r\nprotestations that employer preference is only\r\none factor among the many to be considered. \r\nSee Local 38, IBEW (Cleveland Illuminating\r\nCo.), </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.L.R.B.</span> <span class=\"page\">1719</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1722 (1962).  Every\r\nsurvey undertaken of Board  10(k) decisions\r\nbears out this conclusion.  See Atleson,\r\nsupra, note 6 at 117, 151-52; Collister,\r\nsupra, note 5 at 57-58; Gitlow, Technology and\r\nNLRB Decisions in Bargaining Unit and\r\nJurisdictional Dispute Cases, 16 Lab.

The NLRB  10(k) decision here issued prior to the\r\narbitrator's award.  We think this significant because of the\r\nBoard's duty to consider an arbitration award in its  10(k)\r\ndetermination.  See Carey v. Westinghouse Corp., 375 U.S. at 270-\r\n71.  In the case at bar, no arbitration award had been made prior\r\nto the time the Board issued its determination.  Although the Board\r\npresumably knew that arbitration was in process and could have\r\ndeferred its decision until the award was made, its primary duty\r\nunder  10(k) was to bring the jurisdictional dispute to an end as\r\nsoon as reasonably possible.  See N.L.R.B. v. Radio and Television\r\nBroad. Eng'rs Union, 364 U.S. at 579.  We cannot fault the Board\r\nfor acting promptly under the Supreme Court mandate that the Board\r\nmust decide under  10(k) which union members were entitled to the\r\ndisputed work.  The Board did not have the arbitrator's award\r\nbefore it for consideration.\r\nAnother factor that compels our final determination is\r\nthat the arbitration award for damages seems to mean that the\r\nLaborers are entitled to damages for the balance of the work on the\r\nentire project.  It states:\r\nAll of this evidence  supports the conclusion\r\nthat the collective bargaining agreement was\r\nintended to have stripping of concrete forms\r\nperformed by a composite crew of carpenters\r\nand laborers.  This did not occur when the\r\nEmployers assigned all actual stripping work\r\nto the carpenters.  Therefore, I find that\r\nthis assignment violated the Agreement.\r\n\nAs remedy, the grievants are entitled to be\r\nmade whole for lost wages and benefits.  At\r\nthe Union's request I will retain jurisdiction\r\nover calculation of the damages for a period\r\nof 120 days should the parties be unable to\r\nagree amongst themselves.\r\n\nThe award is not limited to the work on the particular\r\nportion of the project where the dispute erupted.  As we read the\r\ndistrict court's opinion it proceeded on the assumption that the\r\ndamages award covered the work to be done on the entire project\r\n(i.e., The Old Colony Railway).  The Contractors-Employers would be\r\npaying a high price for settling a labor dispute which the  10(k)\r\ndecision was designed to accomplish without the employer paying\r\ntribute.  This is contrary to the dictates of Carey v. Westinghouse\r\nCorp., 375 U.S. at 272, where the Court held that \"[s]hould the\r\nBoard disagree with the arbiter, . . . the Board's ruling would of\r\ncourse, take precedence; and if the employer's action had been in\r\naccord with that ruling, it would not be liable for damages under\r\n301.\"\r\nWe acknowledge that the Court has tried to reconcile\r\narbitration awards with  10(k) decisions in jurisdictional labor\r\ndisputes.  See Carey, 375 U.S. at 263-64, 266.  There are\r\nsituations, however, and this is one, where arbitration and  10(k)\r\ndecisions clash.  We agree with the Third Circuit that there can be\r\nno logical distinction between \"seeking the work and seeking\r\npayment for the work.\"  Local 30, United Slate, Tile &amp; Comp.\r\nRoofers v. N.L.R.B., 1 F.3d at 1427.\r\nWe affirm the judgment of the district court. \n</pre>",
