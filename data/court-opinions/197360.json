R.  Civ. P.  56, we  assess the\r\n\nrecord  in  the  light  most  flattering  to  him  and  draw  all\r\n\nsupportable inferences in his  favor.  See Garside v.  Osco Drug,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990).\r              \r\n\n          The curtain  rises in Saugus,  Massachusetts.   Shortly\r\n\nafter  9:00 p.m.  on December  28, 1990,  Saugus  police officers\r\n\nMichael  McGrath  and David  Putnam were  on  patrol in  a police\r\n\ncruiser.  They received  notice of a disturbance at  a McDonald's\r\n\nrestaurant on Route 1.  As it passes through Saugus,  Route 1 has\r\n\nsix  travel lanes (three  northbound and three  southbound).  The\r\n\nposted speed  limit is 45  miles per hour.   At  the time of  the\r\n\nevents in question, weather conditions were execrable:  a mixture\r\n\nof  snow and rain,  with slush beginning  to form on  the road in\r\n\nspots.\r\n\n          In   the  course   of   responding   to  the   reported\r\n\ndisturbance, the officers received a second radio dispatch to the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1In actuality, there are  two plaintiffs:  Louis  Boveri and\r\nhis  wife, Rose  Boveri.   Inasmuch as  Rose's claim  is entirely\r\nderivative  of her spouse's, we treat the appeal as if Louis were\r\nthe sole plaintiff.\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\neffect  that the individuals involved were leaving the scene in a\r\n\nsmall, dark-colored Honda automobile.   The officers arrived just\r\n\nas  a car  matching the  reported description  pulled out  of the\r\n\nrestaurant's  parking  area  and sped  north  on  Route  1.   The\r\n\nofficers  followed,  activating  their  siren  and  blue  lights.\r\n\nInstead of  stopping, the Honda  accelerated.  The  officers gave\r\n\nchase.\r\n\n          The pursuit continued along Route 1 at speeds in excess\r\n\nof 80 miles per hour for  more than three miles.  Throughout, the\r\n\nofficers remained  only a  few car lengths  to the rear,  and the\r\n\ndriver of the  Honda, James Wade, desperately  attempted to elude\r\n\nthem.  Under Wade's aegis, the Honda weaved from lane to lane and\r\n\ntried  to  use other  vehicles  to obstruct  the  trailing police\r\n\ncruiser.  At one point, the Honda left the road, did a 360-degree\r\n\nspin,  and returned  to the  highway.   Wade later  described the\r\n\nchase as being \"like a video game.\"\r\n\n          In  Lynnfield, the Honda left Route 1 via the Route 129\r\n\nexit.   The plaintiff's vehicle was ahead of the Honda, signaling\r\n\nto  turn  right.   Wade  could not  stop  in time  and  the Honda\r\n\nhydroplaned   into  the  plaintiff's  car,  instigating  a  chain\r\n\ncollision.   Officers  McGrath  and Putnam  arrived at  the scene\r\n\ninstantaneously,   apprehended   Wade,   and   summoned   medical\r\n\nassistance   for  the   plaintiff  (who   had  sustained   severe\r\n\ninjuries).2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Wade  subsequently  entered a  guilty  plea  to charges  of\r\naggravated  rape, burglary, and larceny  of a motor  vehicle.  We\r\nassume for purposes  of this  appeal that the  officers were  not\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          The   plaintiff   sued   McGrath,   Putnam,   and   the\r\n\nmunicipality under 42 U.S.C.    1983 (1994), alleging principally\r\n\nthat the officers' conduct violated his right to  substantive due\r\n\nprocess.   The  district court  granted summary  judgment  in the\r\n\nofficers' favor based on  qualified immunity, concluding that the\r\n\nofficers' conduct  did not  violate  clearly established  federal\r\n\nconstitutional or  statutory rights of which  a reasonable police\r\n\nofficer would have known.  This appeal followed.3\r\n\n          Summary  judgment  is proper  only  when  \"there is  no\r\n\ngenuine issue as  to any material fact and . . . the moving party\r\n\nis entitled to a judgment as  a matter of law.\"  Fed. R.  Civ. P.\r\n\n56(c).  Our  review of  the district court's  application of  the\r\n\nrule is plenary.  See Garside, 895 F.2d at 48.\r                                       \r\n\n          While this appeal was pending, we seized an opportunity\r\n\nto  clarify the  appropriate  legal standard  for  claims that  a\r\n\npolice pursuit violates substantive due process.   See Evans, 100\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d at  1038.  We  apply that  standard here,  mindful that  the\r\n\nlower court's rationale  does not delimit the  scope of appellate\r\n\nreview.  An appellate court may, if it chooses to do so, affirm a\r\n\nsummary  judgment  on any  alternative  ground  supported by  the\r\n\nrecord.  See Hachikian v. FDIC, 96 F.3d 502, 504 (1st Cir. 1996).\r                                        \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\naware that the Honda was stolen or that its driver was implicated\r\nin rape and burglary.\r\n\n     3Only  the officers  moved for  brevis disposition,  yet the\r                                                     \r\ntrial court entered judgment  for all three defendants (including\r\nthe  town of  Saugus).   Because the  plaintiff has  not assigned\r\nerror to that seeming  irregularity, we deem any objection  to be\r\nwaived.\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\n          It is by now axiomatic that 42 U.S.C.   1983 supplies a\r\n\nprivate  right of action against a person who, acting under color\r\n\nof  state  law, deprives  another  of  federally secured  rights.\r\n\nActing under  this rubric, claimants harmed  by police misconduct\r\n\noccurring  outside the  context  of a  seizure theoretically  may\r\n\nbring suits alleging the  deprivation of rights protected by  the\r\n\nsubstantive  component of the Due Process Clause.  See Evans, 100\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d  at 1036.    But the  Supreme  Court has  cautioned  against\r\n\ninterpreting  the Due  Process  Clause so  extravagantly that  it\r\n\n\"impose[s]   federal   duties  that   are   analogous   to  those\r\n\ntraditionally imposed by  state tort  law.\"  Collins  v. City  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nHarker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 128 (1992).\r                        \r\n\n          There  is  another  caveat  applicable  here.    Police\r\n\npursuits have a special dimension:   although they are  dangerous\r\n\nand inevitably create risks  to bystanders, they are at  the same\r\n\ntime an essential  law enforcement tool  for the apprehension  of\r\n\nsuspects.   See  Evans, 100  F.3d  at 1038.    To use  the  tool,\r                                \r\n\nhowever,  police  officers  are  forced  to   make  instantaneous\r\n\njudgments  about how  to  balance  the  legitimate needs  of  law\r\n\nenforcement and  the risks to public safety.   See id.  Conscious\r                                                                \r\n\nof the difficult nature  of this balancing act, we  determined in\r\n\nEvans that \"in order  for a high-speed police pursuit  to intrude\r               \r\n\nupon substantive  due process protections, the  officers' conduct\r\n\nmust not only manifest deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's\r\n\nrights,  but must also  shock the  conscience.\"   Id.   The Evans\r                                                                           \r\n\nparadigm is fully applicable in the instant case.\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n          Applying  Evans, we  are  satisfied  that the  district\r                                   \r\n\ncourt  appropriately  granted  brevis   disposition.    When  the\r                                               \r\n\nofficers first spotted the Honda, they had good reason to attempt\r\n\nto  stop it.   They knew  that its  driver and  his passenger had\r\n\ncreated a disturbance at McDonald's.  From  their experience with\r\n\nsuch disturbances,  coupled with the  Honda's rate of  speed, the\r\n\nofficers were justifiably concerned that the driver was under the\r\n\ninfluence  of alcohol (a concern which doubtless was magnified by\r\n\nthe  officers' awareness  that New  Year's Eve  was approaching).\r\n\nWhen the Honda  initially failed  to stop despite  the siren  and\r\n\nflashing lights,  the stakes  increased.   At that  juncture, the\r\n\nofficers were  warranted in mounting  a pursuit;  leaving such  a\r\n\ndriver on the road would not only stymie law enforcement but also\r\n\nendanger the public.\r\n\n          To be sure, as  the chase progressed, the Honda's  wild\r\n\ndriving plainly created an escalating risk  of harm to bystanders\r\n\n   but the officers' continuation  of the pursuit  must be judged\r\n\nagainst  the exigencies of the situation that had developed.  The\r\n\nlaw enforcement interest in apprehending the Honda had grown,  as\r\n\nhad  the  danger to  the public  inherent  in leaving  a reckless\r\n\n(potentially inebriated)  driver on the  road.  Under  Evans, the\r                                                                      \r\n\nquestion is not whether  the officers' decision to dog  the Honda\r\n\nwas  sound    decisions of  this sort  always involve  matters of\r\n\ndegree   but, rather,  whether a rational jury  could say it  was\r\n\nconscience-shocking.  Here, as in Evans, we think not.  \r                                                 \r\n\n          The plaintiff asseverates that this case is  materially\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ndifferent  from  Evans  because,   here,  the  officers'  conduct\r                                \r\n\nviolated departmental  rules, state  law, and  an order  from the\r\n\ndispatcher  to cease and  desist.   But to  the extent  that this\r\n\nasseveration  is  supported  by  the  record,  these  attributes,\r\n\nindividually and collectively, do not suffice to  tip the scales.\r\n\nWe explain briefly.\r\n\n          The  plaintiff's assertion  that the  officers violated\r\n\ndepartmental rules finds  some purchase  in the record.   A  1988\r\n\nmemorandum authored by the Saugus police chief, Donald M. Peters,\r\n\ndirects officers to \"engage in high speed chases only in cases of\r\n\nserious felonies.\"   Although  it turned  out that  the officers'\r\n\nquarry  had  committed  serious  felonies  (rape,  burglary,  and\r\n\nlarceny of a motor vehicle), it is uncertain whether the officers\r\n\nhad any  inkling of this circumstance.  See supra note 2.  Still,\r                                                           \r\n\nassuming for  argument's sake that McGrath and Putnam mounted the\r\n\nchase  in   contravention  of  a  departmental   regulation,  the\r\n\nviolation  would  not  transgress  the   \"shock  the  conscience\"\r\n\nstandard.\r\n\n          A regulatory violation, like  a violation of state law,\r\n\nis  not inherently  sufficient to support  a    1983 claim.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nMartinez v.

While departmental regulations  are helpful in\r\n\nmeasuring police officers'  conduct against the  Evans benchmark,\r                                                                \r\n\ncourts must look past the regulations to the officers' underlying\r\n\nactions to determine whether their behavior shocks the conscience\r\n\n(and,  thus,  violates a  plaintiff's  right  to substantive  due\r\n\nprocess).   See Temkin v. Frederick County Comm'rs, 945 F.2d 716,\r                                                            \r\n\n723  (4th Cir. 1991) (applying this principle in a police pursuit\r\n\ncase).\r\n\n          There  is  nothing  in  state  law  that  supports  the\r\n\nplaintiff's  contention that  the  officers'  actions  shock  the\r\n\nconscience.   In this regard,  the plaintiff's main  claim to the\r\n\ncontrary   that  the officers  abridged state law  by driving  in\r\n\nexcess   of   the   speed  limit       is   a   figment  of   his\r\n\nmischaracterization of the legal rules governing the operation of\r\n\nemergency vehicles.  Massachusetts law allows a police officer to\r\n\nexceed  the speed limit \"in an emergency and while in performance\r\n\nof  a public duty  . . .  if he exercises caution  and due regard\r\n\nunder the circumstances  for the safety of persons and property.\"\r\n\nMass.  Gen. L. ch.  89,   7B  (1989).  While  the plaintiff might\r\n\nargue  plausibly that the officers failed to exercise due care in\r\n\npursuing the Honda, negligence under state law does not amount to\r\n\na constitutional violation.  We do not believe that any court, on\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nthis  scumbled   record,  could   find  the   officers'  possible\r\n\nnegligence to be conscience-shocking.\r\n\n          The plaintiff's final point is cut from the same cloth.\r\n\nThe  plaintiff  asserts  that   McGrath  and  Putnam  ignored  an\r\n\ninstruction  by   a  supervisory  officer,   issued  through  the\r\n\ndispatcher,  to break off their  pursuit of the  Honda.  Although\r\n\nthere is no  evidence in  the record to  support this  assertion,\r\n\nJudge  Wolf noted that he would have allowed further discovery to\r\n\ninvestigate it had he found it to be outcome-determinative.  Even\r\n\nassuming,  therefore, that  this  claim is  factually correct,  a\r\n\nsupervisor's  judgment that  a pursuit  should be  halted neither\r\n\nincreases nor decreases the risks inherent in the pursuit itself.\r\n\nIn  the circumstances of this case    a brief chase on a limited-\r\n\naccess highway on the trail of a vehicle which appeared to pose a\r\n\nsignificant threat  to public safety    the officers'  failure to\r\n\nheed  their  supervisor  does   not  sink  to  the  level   of  a\r\n\nconstitutional breach.\r\n\n          In  the last  analysis,  the signals  are  mixed    the\r\n\ninclement weather, the relatively high speeds, and the overriding\r\n\nof a departmental  regulation are troubling, but  these facts are\r\n\nameliorated because the chase was brief (under five  minutes), it\r\n\ntook  place on a six-lane,  limited-access highway, and turning a\r\n\nblind eye  would have  left the public  in jeopardy    and  mixed\r\n\nsignals  are not the stuff  from which a  finding that particular\r\n\nconduct shocks the conscience can easily be derived.\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\n          We need go no further.4  Even though we acknowledge the\r\n\nimprecision of  the \"shock the  conscience\" test, see  Evans, 100\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d  at 1039, the officers' conduct here is more reasonable than\r\n\nthat  displayed  in  several  cases  in  which  appellate  courts\r\n\nunderstandably  have held  police  behavior not  to traverse  the\r\n\nconstitutional  line.  See, e.g.,  Fagan v. City  of Vineland, 22\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d  1296,  1299-1300  (3d Cir.  1994)  (en  banc) (involving  a\r\n\npursuit at up to 80 m.p.h.  through many red lights); Temkin, 945\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at 718 (involving a pursuit at  speeds up to 105 m.p.h. on a\r\n\nnarrow, two-lane  highway).  Because we agree  with the decisions\r\n\nin those cases, we  also agree, a fortiori, that the  court below\r\n\ncorrectly decided the case at bar.\r\n\nAffirmed.\r          Affirmed.\r                  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Of course,  our holding  today does  not mean  that injured\r\nparties are necessarily remediless in these situations; state law\r\nprovides an avenue for recourse (although perhaps a less generous\r\none).

Shortly after 9:00 p.m.  on December 28, 1990, Saugus police officers Michael McGrath and David Putnam were on patrol in a police cruiser.  They received notice of a disturbance at a McDonald's restaurant on Route 1. As it passes through Saugus, Route 1 has six travel lanes (three northbound and three southbound).  The posted speed limit is 45 miles per hour.  At the time of the events in question, weather conditions were execrable:  a mixture of snow and rain, with slush beginning to form on the road in spots.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the course of responding to the reported disturbance, the officers received a second radio dispatch to the effect that the individuals involved were leaving the scene in a small, dark-colored Honda automobile.  The officers arrived just as a car matching the reported description pulled out of the restaurant's parking area and sped north on Route 1. The officers followed, activating their siren and blue lights.  Instead of stopping, the Honda accelerated.  The officers gave chase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pursuit continued along Route 1 at speeds in excess of 80 miles per hour for more than three miles.  Throughout, the officers remained only a few car lengths to the rear, and the driver of the Honda, James Wade, desperately attempted to elude them.  Under Wade's aegis, the Honda weaved from lane to lane and tried to use other vehicles to obstruct the trailing police cruiser.  At one point, the Honda left the road, did a 360-degree spin, and returned to the highway.  Wade later described the chase as being \"like a video game.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Lynnfield, the Honda left Route 1 via the Route 129 exit.  The plaintiff's vehicle was ahead of the Honda, signaling to turn right.  Wade could not stop in time and the Honda hydroplaned into the plaintiff's car, instigating a chain collision.  Officers McGrath and Putnam arrived at the scene instantaneously, apprehended Wade, and summoned medical assistance for the plaintiff (who had sustained severe injuries).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff sued McGrath, Putnam, and the municipality under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (1994), alleging principally that the officers' conduct violated his right to substantive due process.  The district court granted summary judgment in the officers' favor based on qualified immunity, concluding that the officers' conduct did not violate clearly established federal constitutional or statutory rights of which a reasonable police officer would have known.  This appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is proper only when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Our review of the district court's application of the rule is plenary.  See Garside, 895 F.2d at 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this appeal was pending, we seized an opportunity to clarify the appropriate legal standard for claims that a police pursuit violates substantive due process.  See Evans, 100 F.3d at 1038.   We apply that standard here, mindful that the lower court's rationale does not delimit the scope of appellate review.  An appellate court may, if it chooses to do so, affirm a summary judgment on any alternative ground supported by the record.  See Hachikian v. FDIC, 96 F.3d 502, 504 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is by now axiomatic that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 supplies a private right of action against a person who, acting under color of state law, deprives another of federally secured rights.  Acting under this rubric, claimants harmed by police misconduct occurring outside the context of a seizure theoretically may bring suits alleging the deprivation of rights protected by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.  See Evans, 100 F.3d at 1036.   But the Supreme Court has cautioned against interpreting the Due Process Clause so extravagantly that it \"impose[s] federal duties that are analogous to those traditionally imposed by state tort law.\"  Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 128, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 1070, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is another caveat applicable here.  Police pursuits have a special dimension:  although they are dangerous and inevitably create risks to bystanders, they are at the same time an essential law enforcement tool for the apprehension of suspects.  See Evans, 100 F.3d at 1038.   To use the tool, however, police officers are forced to make instantaneous judgments about how to balance the legitimate needs of law enforcement and the risks to public safety.  See id.   Conscious of the difficult nature of this balancing act, we determined in Evans that \"in order for a high-speed police pursuit to intrude upon substantive due process protections, the officers' conduct must not only manifest deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's rights, but must also shock the conscience.\"  Id. The Evans paradigm is fully applicable in the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying Evans, we are satisfied that the district court appropriately granted brevis disposition.  When the officers first spotted the Honda, they had good reason to attempt to stop it.  They knew that its driver and his passenger had created a disturbance at McDonald's.  From their experience with such disturbances, coupled with the Honda's rate of speed, the officers were justifiably concerned that the driver was under the influence of alcohol (a concern which doubtless was magnified by the officers' awareness that New Year's Eve was approaching).  When the Honda initially failed to stop despite the siren and flashing lights, the stakes increased.  At that juncture, the officers were warranted in mounting a pursuit;  leaving such a driver on the road would not only stymie law enforcement but also endanger the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, as the chase progressed, the Honda's wild driving plainly created an escalating risk of harm to bystanders--but the officers' continuation of the pursuit must be judged against the exigencies of the situation that had developed.  The law enforcement interest in apprehending the Honda had grown, as had the danger to the public inherent in leaving a reckless (potentially inebriated) driver on the road.  Under Evans, the question is not whether the officers' decision to dog the Honda was sound--decisions of this sort always involve matters of degreebut, rather, whether a rational jury could say it was conscience-shocking.  Here, as in Evans, we think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff asseverates that this case is materially different from Evans because, here, the officers' conduct violated departmental rules, state law, and an order from the dispatcher to cease and desist.  But to the extent that this asseveration is supported by the record, these attributes, individually and collectively, do not suffice to tip the scales.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's assertion that the officers violated departmental rules finds some purchase in the record.  A 1988 memorandum authored by the Saugus police chief, Donald M. Peters, directs officers to \"engage in high speed chases only in cases of serious felonies.\"   Although it turned out that the officers' quarry had committed serious felonies (rape, burglary, and larceny of a motor vehicle), it is uncertain whether the officers had any inkling of this circumstance.  See supra note 2. Still, assuming for argument's sake that McGrath and Putnam mounted the chase in contravention of a departmental regulation, the violation would not transgress the \"shock the conscience\" standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A regulatory violation, like a violation of state law, is not inherently sufficient to support a &#167; 1983 claim.  See Martinez v. Colon, 54 F.3d 980, 989 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 515, 133 L.Ed.2d 423 (1995);  PFZ Properties, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 928 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir.1991);  Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 757 (1st Cir.1990) (\"Even bad-faith violations of state law are not necessarily tantamount to unconstitutional deprivations of due process.\");   see also Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 196, 104 S.Ct. 3012, 3020, 82 L.Ed.2d 139 (1984) (rejecting argument that an official's conduct is objectively unreasonable when it violates a statute or regulation and admonishing that it is not \"always fair, or sound policy, to demand official compliance with statute and regulation on pain of money damages\").  While departmental regulations are helpful in measuring police officers' conduct against the Evans benchmark, courts must look past the regulations to the officers' underlying actions to determine whether their behavior shocks the conscience (and, thus, violates a plaintiff's right to substantive due process).  See Temkin v. Frederick County Comm'rs, 945 F.2d 716, 723 (4th Cir.1991) (applying this principle in a police pursuit case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing in state law that supports the plaintiff's contention that the officers' actions shock the conscience.  In this regard, the plaintiff's main claim to the contrary--that the officers abridged state law by driving in excess of the speed limit--is a figment of his mischaracterization of the legal rules governing the operation of emergency vehicles.  Massachusetts law allows a police officer to exceed the speed limit \"in an emergency and while in performance of a public duty ... if he exercises caution and due regard under the circumstances for the safety of persons and property.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch. 89, &#167; 7B (1989).  While the plaintiff might argue plausibly that the officers failed to exercise due care in pursuing the Honda, negligence under state law does not amount to a constitutional violation.  We do not believe that any court, on this scumbled record, could find the officers' possible negligence to be conscience-shocking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's final point is cut from the same cloth.  The plaintiff asserts that McGrath and Putnam ignored an instruction by a supervisory officer, issued through the dispatcher, to break off their pursuit of the Honda.  Although there is no evidence in the record to support this assertion, Judge Wolf noted that he would have allowed further discovery to investigate it had he found it to be outcome-determinative.  Even assuming, therefore, that this claim is factually correct, a supervisor's judgment that a pursuit should be halted neither increases nor decreases the risks inherent in the pursuit itself.  In the circumstances of this case--a brief chase on a limited-access highway on the trail of a vehicle which appeared to pose a significant threat to public safety--the officers' failure to heed their supervisor does not sink to the level of a constitutional breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, the signals are mixed--the inclement weather, the relatively high speeds, and the overriding of a departmental regulation are troubling, but these facts are ameliorated because the chase was brief (under five minutes), it took place on a six-lane, limited-access highway, and turning a blind eye would have left the public in jeopardy--and mixed signals are not the stuff from which a finding that particular conduct shocks the conscience can easily be derived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Even though we acknowledge the imprecision of the \"shock the conscience\" test, see Evans, 100 F.3d at 1039, the officers' conduct here is more reasonable than that displayed in several cases in which appellate courts understandably have held police behavior not to traverse the constitutional line.  See, e.g., Fagan v. City of Vineland, 22 F.3d 1296, 1299-1300 (3d Cir.1994) (en banc) (involving a pursuit at up to 80 m.p.h. through many red lights);  Temkin, 945 F.2d at 718 (involving a pursuit at speeds up to 105 m.p.h. on a narrow, two-lane highway).  Because we agree with the decisions in those cases, we also agree, a fortiori, that the court below correctly decided the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In actuality, there are two plaintiffs:  Louis Boveri and his wife, Rose Boveri.

Officers McGrath and Putnam arrived at the scene instantaneously, apprehended Wade, and summoned medical assistance for the plaintiff (who had sustained severe injuries).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff sued McGrath, Putnam, and the municipality under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (1994), alleging principally that the officers' conduct violated his right to substantive due process.  The district court granted summary judgment in the officers' favor based on qualified immunity, concluding that the officers' conduct did not violate clearly established federal constitutional or statutory rights of which a reasonable police officer would have known.  This appeal followed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment is proper only when \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  Our review of the district court's application of the rule is plenary.  See Garside, 895 F.2d at 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this appeal was pending, we seized an opportunity to clarify the appropriate legal standard for claims that a police pursuit violates substantive due process.  See Evans, 100 F.3d at 1038.   We apply that standard here, mindful that the lower court's rationale does not delimit the scope of appellate review.  An appellate court may, if it chooses to do so, affirm a summary judgment on any alternative ground supported by the record.  See Hachikian v. FDIC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196973\"><a href=\"/opinion/196973/hachikian-v-fdic/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 504 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is by now axiomatic that 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 supplies a private right of action against a person who, acting under color of state law, deprives another of federally secured rights.  Acting under this rubric, claimants harmed by police misconduct occurring outside the context of a seizure theoretically may bring suits alleging the deprivation of rights protected by the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.  See Evans, 100 F.3d at 1036.   But the Supreme Court has cautioned against interpreting the Due Process Clause so extravagantly that it \"impose[s] federal duties that are analogous to those traditionally imposed by state tort law.\"  Collins v. City of Harker Heights, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112699\"><a href=\"/opinion/112699/collins-v-harker-heights/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 128, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112699\"><a href=\"/opinion/112699/collins-v-harker-heights/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">261</span></a></span> (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is another caveat applicable here.  Police pursuits have a special dimension:  although they are dangerous and inevitably create risks to bystanders, they are at the same time an essential law enforcement tool for the apprehension of suspects.  See Evans, 100 F.3d at 1038.   To use the tool, however, police officers are forced to make instantaneous judgments about how to balance the legitimate needs of law enforcement and the risks to public safety.  See id.   Conscious of the difficult nature of this balancing act, we determined in Evans that \"in order for a high-speed police pursuit to intrude upon substantive due process protections, the officers' conduct must not only manifest deliberate indifference to the plaintiff's rights, but must also shock the conscience.\"  Id. The Evans paradigm is fully applicable in the instant case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying Evans, we are satisfied that the district court appropriately granted brevis disposition.  When the officers first spotted the Honda, they had good reason to attempt to stop it.  They knew that its driver and his passenger had created a disturbance at McDonald's.  From their experience with such disturbances, coupled with the Honda's rate of speed, the officers were justifiably concerned that the driver was under the influence of alcohol (a concern which doubtless was magnified by the officers' awareness that New Year's Eve was approaching).  When the Honda initially failed to stop despite the siren and flashing lights, the stakes increased.  At that juncture, the officers were warranted in mounting a pursuit;  leaving such a driver on the road would not only stymie law enforcement but also endanger the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, as the chase progressed, the Honda's wild driving plainly created an escalating risk of harm to bystanders--but the officers' continuation of the pursuit must be judged against the exigencies of the situation that had developed.  The law enforcement interest in apprehending the Honda had grown, as had the danger to the public inherent in leaving a reckless (potentially inebriated) driver on the road.  Under Evans, the question is not whether the officers' decision to dog the Honda was sound--decisions of this sort always involve matters of degreebut, rather, whether a rational jury could say it was conscience-shocking.  Here, as in Evans, we think not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff asseverates that this case is materially different from Evans because, here, the officers' conduct violated departmental rules, state law, and an order from the dispatcher to cease and desist.  But to the extent that this asseveration is supported by the record, these attributes, individually and collectively, do not suffice to tip the scales.  We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's assertion that the officers violated departmental rules finds some purchase in the record.  A 1988 memorandum authored by the Saugus police chief, Donald M. Peters, directs officers to \"engage in high speed chases only in cases of serious felonies.\"   Although it turned out that the officers' quarry had committed serious felonies (rape, burglary, and larceny of a motor vehicle), it is uncertain whether the officers had any inkling of this circumstance.  See supra note 2. Still, assuming for argument's sake that McGrath and Putnam mounted the chase in contravention of a departmental regulation, the violation would not transgress the \"shock the conscience\" standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A regulatory violation, like a violation of state law, is not inherently sufficient to support a &#167; 1983 claim.

While departmental regulations are helpful in measuring police officers' conduct against the Evans benchmark, courts must look past the regulations to the officers' underlying actions to determine whether their behavior shocks the conscience (and, thus, violates a plaintiff's right to substantive due process).  See Temkin v. Frederick County Comm'rs, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"569115\"><a href=\"/opinion/569115/sharon-temkin-bruce-m-temkin-v-frederick-county-commissioners-glen-marion/\"><span class=\"volume\">945</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span>, 723 (4th Cir.1991) (applying this principle in a police pursuit case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing in state law that supports the plaintiff's contention that the officers' actions shock the conscience.  In this regard, the plaintiff's main claim to the contrary--that the officers abridged state law by driving in excess of the speed limit--is a figment of his mischaracterization of the legal rules governing the operation of emergency vehicles.  Massachusetts law allows a police officer to exceed the speed limit \"in an emergency and while in performance of a public duty ... if he exercises caution and due regard under the circumstances for the safety of persons and property.\"   Mass. Gen. L. ch. 89, &#167; 7B (1989).  While the plaintiff might argue plausibly that the officers failed to exercise due care in pursuing the Honda, negligence under state law does not amount to a constitutional violation.  We do not believe that any court, on this scumbled record, could find the officers' possible negligence to be conscience-shocking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's final point is cut from the same cloth.  The plaintiff asserts that McGrath and Putnam ignored an instruction by a supervisory officer, issued through the dispatcher, to break off their pursuit of the Honda.  Although there is no evidence in the record to support this assertion, Judge Wolf noted that he would have allowed further discovery to investigate it had he found it to be outcome-determinative.  Even assuming, therefore, that this claim is factually correct, a supervisor's judgment that a pursuit should be halted neither increases nor decreases the risks inherent in the pursuit itself.  In the circumstances of this case--a brief chase on a limited-access highway on the trail of a vehicle which appeared to pose a significant threat to public safety--the officers' failure to heed their supervisor does not sink to the level of a constitutional breach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, the signals are mixed--the inclement weather, the relatively high speeds, and the overriding of a departmental regulation are troubling, but these facts are ameliorated because the chase was brief (under five minutes), it took place on a six-lane, limited-access highway, and turning a blind eye would have left the public in jeopardy--and mixed signals are not the stuff from which a finding that particular conduct shocks the conscience can easily be derived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Even though we acknowledge the imprecision of the \"shock the conscience\" test, see Evans, 100 F.3d at 1039, the officers' conduct here is more reasonable than that displayed in several cases in which appellate courts understandably have held police behavior not to traverse the constitutional line.  See, e.g., Fagan v. City of Vineland, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669076\"><a href=\"/opinion/669076/sarah-e-fagan-general-administratrix-and-administratrix-ad-prosequendum/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span>, 1299-1300 (3d Cir.1994) (en banc) (involving a pursuit at up to 80 m.p.h. through many red lights);  Temkin, 945 F.2d at 718 (involving a pursuit at speeds up to 105 m.p.h. on a narrow, two-lane highway).  Because we agree with the decisions in those cases, we also agree, a fortiori, that the court below correctly decided the case at bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In actuality, there are two plaintiffs:  Louis Boveri and his wife, Rose Boveri.
