In  Krewson v.  City of\r                                                                         \r\n\nQuincy,  74 F.3d 15 (1st Cir. 1996), McDonough lodged a broad\r                  \r\n\nranging  attack on  the  district court's  award  of fees  to\r\n\nplaintiff-appellee   David   Krewson,   arguing    that   the\r\n\nexcessiveness of  the request made any  award unreasonable on\r\n\nits face and  that much of  the time  for which the  district\r\n\ncourt  awarded  fees  was  attributable to  claims  on  which\r\n\nKrewson did not succeed.   We remanded to the  district court\r\n\nthe recalculation  of the fee  award, having agreed  with the\r\n\ncourt that an award was justified.   McDonough, still unhappy\r\n\nwith  the award the  district court has  made, again appeals.\r\n\nFor  the  second time  he requests  us  to declare  the award\r\n\nfacially  unreasonable, or  yet again  to remand  for further\r\n\nconsideration.  We decline McDonough's request and affirm the\r\n\ndistrict court's fee assessment.  \r\n\n          This  case  arose  after  the  police   in  Quincy,\r\n\nMassachusetts, arrested  David Krewson for the  murder of his\r\n\nfriend and short-term roommate.   After a brief investigation\r\n\nthe Quincy police questioned,  charged and detained  Krewson.\r\n\nAfter  a  brief  further  investigation,  the  Quincy  police\r\n\ndropped all  charges, having  identified the  person actually\r\n\nresponsible for the crime.\r\n\n          A few  days after his release,  Krewson returned to\r\n\nthe  police station.    While at  the station  he encountered\r\n\nMcDonough, then  a Quincy detective who  had investigated the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nmurder  and  played a  significant  role in  the  decision to\r\n\narrest  and charge Krewson.   McDonough, apparently concerned\r\n\nthat Krewson  might take legal action  against him, allegedly\r\n\nthreatened to  \"blow off\"  Krewson's kneecaps should  he file\r\n\nsuit.    \r\n\n          Undeterred by  McDonough's threat, Krewson  filed a\r\n\ncomplaint against McDonough, two of his immediate supervisors\r\n\nand  the City of Quincy  based on alleged  sloppy police work\r\n\nthat led  to  his arrest  and based  on the  later threat  by\r\n\nMcDonough.   Krewson claimed  violations of his  civil rights\r\n\nunder 42 U.S.C.    1983 and Mass. Gen. Laws ch.  12   11I, as\r\n\nwell  as negligence  under  Mass. Gen.  Laws  ch. 258,  false\r\n\narrest,   false   imprisonment,  assault   and   battery  and\r\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress.  \r\n\n          After a four-day trial, the district court directed\r\n\nverdicts in favor of both supervisors on all counts, in favor\r\n\nof the  city on all but the negligence count, and in favor of\r\n\nMcDonough  on  all  counts  except those  pertaining  to  the\r\n\nkneecap  threat.    The   jury  found  McDonough  liable  for\r\n\nintentional   infliction  of   emotional  distress   and  for\r\n\nviolating  the Massachusetts  Civil Rights  Act, and  awarded\r\n\nKrewson a total of $6,500 in damages.\r\n\n          Krewson  filed an  application for  attorneys' fees\r\n\nunder Mass.  Gen. Laws.  ch. 12    11I.   The district  court\r\n\nawarded a total of  $80,649.29 in fees and costs.   McDonough\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nappealed the fee award,  and we remanded for  a determination\r\n\nof  whether  time  spent  on unsuccessful  claims  should  be\r\n\neliminated  from  the fee  award,  and  whether the  cost  of\r\n\nKrewson's  expert, Robert  DiGrazia, should be  eliminated as\r\n\nrelating solely to the unsuccessful  claims.  See Krewson, 74\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 19-20.  \r\n\n          On remand  the district court concluded  that a fee\r\n\naward  which included time  spent on unsuccessful  as well as\r\n\nsuccessful claims was appropriate, and that DiGrazia's expert\r\n\nfee was a justifiable  cost.1  On appeal Krewson  attempts to\r\n\nresurrect his  prior argument that the  district court should\r\n\nhave awarded no attorneys' fees  because the amount sought is\r\n\nexcessive for the result achieved.  We rejected that argument\r\n\nin the  first appeal.  See Krewson,  74 F.3d at 16.   The two\r                                              \r\n\nremaining issues  are whether the district  court should have\r\n\nawarded  fees for the hours  spent on unsuccessful claims and\r\n\nwhether the court should have included DiGrazia's fee as part\r\n\nof the award.  We find neither issue compelling.\r\n\n          We review the district  court's fee award for abuse\r\n\nof discretion.  See id. at 17 (quoting Lipsett v. Blanco, 975\r                                                                    \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  In  response to  McDonough's general  arguments regarding\r\nthe  size of the fee claimed, the district court did subtract\r\n98  hours from  Krewson's request  to reflect  excessive pre-\r\ntrial  preparation,  specifically,  time  spent   on  routine\r\nmotions, reading and indexing depositions and  preparing pre-\r\ntrial memoranda.   We note  that, as  adjusted, the  district\r\ncourt  awarded  Krewson  attorneys'  fees in  the  amount  of\r\n$53,117 and costs in the amount of $13,262.29.    \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nF.2d  934,  937  (1st  Cir.  1992)).     The  district  court\r\n\nidentified a sufficient link between Krewson's successful and\r\n\nunsuccessful  claims to  support  a fee  award  that was  not\r\n\nreduced for time spent on the unsuccessful claims.  The court\r\n\nfound  that  McDonough's  threat and  conduct  toward Krewson\r\n\n\"made no sense  at all  except in  the context  of the  prior\r\n\nevents and the  deficiencies of police procedure which led to\r\n\n[Krewson's] arrest.\"   The  district court concluded  that in\r\n\norder to try his successful claims, Krewson would have had to\r\n\ntry  the  entire case,  including  evidence  relevant to  the\r\n\nunsuccessful claims.     \"In  reviewing  determinations  that\r\n\nclaims are or are  not interrelated for purposes of  an award\r\n\nof attorneys' fees, we have exhibited great deference to  the\r\n\ntrial court's discretion.\"  Lipsett  v. Blanco, 975 F.2d 934,\r                                                          \r\n\n941 (1st Cir. 1992).  The events prior to McDonough's threat,\r\n\nwhich formed the basis for the unsuccessful claims, certainly\r\n\ncould be viewed as  necessarily linked to the portion  of the\r\n\ntrial  dealing with the threat.   It was  within the district\r\n\ncourt's   discretion  to   determine  that   without  context\r\n\nMcDonough's  threat  and  conduct  made little  sense.    The\r\n\ndistrict   court's   conclusion   falls  within   its   broad\r\n\ndiscretion.\r\n\n          The   district   court   further   concluded   that\r\n\nDiGrazia's testimony  \"was appropriately part  of [Krewson's]\r\n\neffort to show why Detective McDonough had legitimate fear of\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\na civil suit, which he tried to forestall by an inappropriate\r\n\nthreat.\"  At trial, DiGrazia testified that the investigation\r\n\nof the  murder lacked  \"correct and accepted  standard police\r\n\npractices.\"   In DiGrazia's  opinion,  the investigation  was\r\n\ngeared  more  toward  quickly  finding  someone  guilty  than\r\n\nreaching proper  conclusions as  to the actual  guilty party.\r\n\nDiGrazia further testified that  the Quincy police department\r\n\nlacked  adequate  training  and  management.     Finally,  he\r\n\ntestified that  Detective McDonough lacked  adequate training\r\n\nin  the  investigation of  homicides.   If the  jury believed\r\n\nDiGrazia,  his testimony would  tend to provide  a motive for\r\n\nMcDonough's  subsequent conduct  toward  Krewson.    On  this\r\n\nrecord it was well within the district court's discretion  to\r\n\nconclude  that  DiGrazia's  opinions  also   established  the\r\n\nunderlying basis for  McDonough's threat, making that  threat\r\n\nmore believable.\r\n\n          Our prior  decision did not mandate  a reduction to\r\n\naccount  for Krewson's prosecution of the unsuccessful claims\r\n\nor DiGrazia's fee.  We simply remanded for the district court\r\n\nto consider those  issues.   See Krewson, 74  F.3d at  19-20.\r                                                    \r\n\nThe  district court has considered them and we do not find an\r\n\nabuse of discretion.   See  id. at 17  (noting that  district\r                                           \r\n\ncourt's fee award is reviewed for abuse of discretion).    \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n          Affirmed.2\r                      Affirmed.\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.

Appellee is\r\ndirected to submit a properly detailed petition for appellate\r\nfees  within  10  days  of  the  issuance  of  this  opinion.\r\nAppellant McDonough  shall have  10 days thereafter  to raise\r\nobjections  to the fee petition.

The events prior to McDonough's threat, which formed the basis for the unsuccessful claims, certainly could be viewed as necessarily linked to the portion of the trial dealing with the threat.

Farraher, Jr., Marshfield, MA, argued (David C. Jenkins and Dwyer &amp; Jenkins, Boston, MA, were on brief), for defendant-appellant McDonough.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Robert L.

In Krewson v. City of Quincy, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></span> (1st Cir.1996), McDonough lodged a broad ranging attack on the district court's award of fees to plaintiff-appellee David Krewson, arguing that the excessiveness of the request made any award unreasonable on its face and that much of the time for which the district court awarded fees was attributable to claims on which Krewson did not succeed.  We remanded to the district court the recalculation of the fee award, having agreed with the court that an award was justified.  McDonough, still unhappy with the award the district court has made, again appeals.  For the second time he requests us to declare the award facially unreasonable, or yet again to remand for further consideration.  We decline McDonough's request and affirm the district court's fee assessment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case arose after the police in Quincy, Massachusetts, arrested David Krewson for the murder of his friend and short-term roommate.  After a brief investigation the Quincy police questioned, charged and detained Krewson.  After a brief further investigation, the Quincy police dropped all charges, having identified the person actually responsible for the crime.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A few days after his release, Krewson returned to the police station.  While at the station he encountered McDonough, then a Quincy detective who had investigated the murder and played a significant role in the decision to arrest and charge Krewson.  McDonough, apparently concerned that Krewson might take legal action against him, allegedly threatened to \"blow off\" Krewson's kneecaps should he file suit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undeterred by McDonough's threat, Krewson filed a complaint against McDonough, two of his immediate supervisors and the City of Quincy based on alleged sloppy police work that led to his arrest and based on the later threat by McDonough.  Krewson claimed violations of his civil rights under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 12 &#167; 11I, as well as negligence under Mass.Gen.Laws ch. 258, false arrest, false imprisonment, assault and battery and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a four-day trial, the district court directed verdicts in favor of both supervisors on all counts, in favor of the city on all but the negligence count, and in favor of McDonough on all counts except those pertaining to the kneecap threat.  The jury found McDonough liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress and for violating the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, and awarded Krewson a total of $6,500 in damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Krewson filed an application for attorneys' fees under Mass.Gen.Laws. ch. 12 &#167; 11I.  The district court awarded a total of $80,649.29 in fees and costs.  McDonough appealed the fee award, and we remanded for a determination of whether time spent on unsuccessful claims should be eliminated from the fee award, and whether the cost of Krewson's expert, Robert DiGrazia, should be eliminated as relating solely to the unsuccessful claims.  See Krewson, 74 F.3d at 19-20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand the district court concluded that a fee award which included time spent on unsuccessful as well as successful claims was appropriate, and that DiGrazia's expert fee was a justifiable cost.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  On appeal Krewson attempts to resurrect his prior argument that the district court should have awarded no attorneys' fees because the amount sought is excessive for the result achieved.  We rejected that argument in the first appeal.  See Krewson, 74 F.3d at 16.   The two remaining issues are whether the district court should have awarded fees for the hours spent on unsuccessful claims and whether the court should have included DiGrazia's fee as part of the award.  We find neither issue compelling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's fee award for abuse of discretion.  See id. at 17 (quoting Lipsett v. Blanco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591130\"><a href=\"/opinion/591130/annabelle-lipsett-v-gumersindo-blanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span>, 937 (1st Cir.1992)).  The district court identified a sufficient link between Krewson's successful and unsuccessful claims to support a fee award that was not reduced for time spent on the unsuccessful claims.  The court found that McDonough's threat and conduct toward Krewson \"made no sense at all except in the context of the prior events and the deficiencies of police procedure which led to [Krewson's] arrest.\"   The district court concluded that in order to try his successful claims, Krewson would have had to try the entire case, including evidence relevant to the unsuccessful claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In reviewing determinations that claims are or are not interrelated for purposes of an award of attorneys' fees, we have exhibited great deference to the trial court's discretion.\"  Lipsett v. Blanco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591130\"><a href=\"/opinion/591130/annabelle-lipsett-v-gumersindo-blanco/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">934</span></a></span>, 941 (1st Cir.1992).  The events prior to McDonough's threat, which formed the basis for the unsuccessful claims, certainly could be viewed as necessarily linked to the portion of the trial dealing with the threat.  It was within the district court's discretion to determine that without context McDonough's threat and conduct made little sense.  The district court's conclusion falls within its broad discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court further concluded that DiGrazia's testimony \"was appropriately part of [Krewson's] effort to show why Detective McDonough had legitimate fear of a civil suit, which he tried to forestall by an inappropriate threat.\"   At trial, DiGrazia testified that the investigation of the murder lacked \"correct and accepted standard police practices.\"   In DiGrazia's opinion, the investigation was geared more toward quickly finding someone guilty than reaching proper conclusions as to the actual guilty party.  DiGrazia further testified that the Quincy police department lacked adequate training and management.  Finally, he testified that Detective McDonough lacked adequate training in the investigation of homicides.  If the jury believed DiGrazia, his testimony would tend to provide a motive for McDonough's subsequent conduct toward Krewson.  On this record it was well within the district court's discretion to conclude that DiGrazia's opinions also established the underlying basis for McDonough's threat, making that threat more believable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our prior decision did not mandate a reduction to account for Krewson's prosecution of the unsuccessful claims or DiGrazia's fee.
