In the district  court, Maureen\r                                      \r\n\nMaigret and Susan  Sweet moved for summary  judgment, arguing\r\n\nthat Rhoda Tang's  claim against them under 42  U.S.C.   1983\r\n\nwas barred  by qualified immunity.   The district  court held\r\n\nthat  factual  disputes precluded  summary  judgment on  this\r\n\nissue,  and Maigret  and Sweet  have  taken an  interlocutory\r\n\nappeal   to  this  court.    Under  governing  Supreme  Court\r\n\nprecedent, we are obliged to dismiss the appeal on procedural\r\n\ngrounds.\r\n\n     Tang, an Asian  American, has worked as a  public health\r\n\nnutritionist  at  the  Rhode  Island  Department  of  Elderly\r\n\nAffairs  since  1974.    In  her  view,  the  Department  has\r\n\ndiscriminated  against  her  for   many  years,  in   various\r\n\nrespects, primarily on  account of her race.   The history of\r\n\nlitigation includes a formal administrative charge by Tang of\r\n\nemployment discrimination and  a settlement of the  matter in\r\n\n1987, and Tang's 1989 discharge and 1992 reinstatement, which\r\n\nfollowed union-initiated arbitration.\r\n\n     In 1996, Tang filed the present action in district court\r\n\nagainst  the Department,  Maigret  (former  director  of  the\r\n\nDepartment), and Sweet  (then the associate director).   Tang\r\n\ncharged  that she had  been discriminated against  for racial\r\n\nand other  reasons in the  conditions of  her employment  and\r\n\nalso  had been  subjected to  retaliation on  account  of her\r\n\nprior  complaint.   Her claims  were based  on Title  VII, 42\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nU.S.C.     2000e-2 and 3, on 42 U.S.C.     1981 and 1983, and\r\n\non counterpart provisions of Rhode Island law.\r\n\n     After some  preliminary skirmishing,  Maigret and  Sweet\r\n\nmoved  for summary  judgment  as to  the  section 1983  claim\r\n\nagainst them on grounds of qualified immunity.  They conceded\r\n\nthat there  was a clearly  established right to be  free from\r\n\nracial  discrimination.     But,   relying  upon   Harlow  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nFitzgerald,  457  U.S.  800,  819  (1982),  and  Anderson  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635,  638-39 (1987), they argued  that an\r                     \r\n\nobjectively  reasonable  person  would  not  think  that  the\r\n\nconduct attributed to them by Tang violated that right.  \r\n\n     Some  of  the incidents  cited  by Tang  as  examples of\r\n\nracial discrimination or retaliation would strike many people\r\n\nas tame  (for example, that  she was given too  many clerical\r\n\ntasks); others might be more  serious.  But Maigret and Sweet\r\n\nsought  to  narrow  the  focus  by  asserting that  each  was\r\n\ndirectly linked only to one  or two incidents.  Tang answered\r\n\nthat  factual  issues,  including   the  defendants'  alleged\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent, precluded summary judgment.\r\n\n     In October 1996,  the district court filed  a memorandum\r\n\nand  order  concluding  that  \"the  [individual]  defendants'\r\n\nmotion for qualified immunity must  be and is hereby deferred\r\n\nuntil completion of the trial  of the plaintiff's case.\"  The\r\n\ncourt  declined to \"detai[l] the allegations the parties have\r\n\nmade\" but  explained: \"It suffices  to say that I  agree with\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nplaintiff's counsel that  the vast majority of the  facts are\r\n\nin dispute.\"  This appeal followed.\r\n\n     Although  Tang defends the district court's order on the\r\n\nmerits, she also says that we have no authority to review the\r\n\ndistrict court's order.   The objection, couched  in language\r\n\ntaken from a recent Supreme  Court case, is that \"a defendant\r\n\nentitled  to  invoke  a qualified  immunity  defense  may not\r\n\nappeal a  district court  summary judgment  order insofar  as\r\n\nthat order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets\r\n\nforth a `genuine issue of fact  for trial.'\"  See Johnson  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nJones, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 2159 (1995).\r                 \r\n\n     The  Supreme Court  had  earlier  held  in  Mitchell  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nForsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530  (1985), that despite the ordinary\r                   \r\n\nrequirement  of finality, a  denial of qualified  immunity on\r\n\nlegal grounds is immediately  appealable under the collateral\r\n\norder doctrine.  But in Johnson, it narrowed this opportunity\r                                           \r\n\nby  saying that  an  interlocutory appeal  from  a denial  of\r\n\nimmunity  would not  be permitted  where  the district  court\r\n\nfound  that a  genuine issue  of  material fact  precluded an\r\n\nimmediate grant of  qualified immunity.  115 S.  Ct. at 2156-\r\n\n58.  Accord Behrens v. Pelletier, 116 S. Ct. 834, 842 (1996).\r                                            \r\n\n     In  construing these cases,  this court has  spelled out\r\n\nwhat is  implicit in Johnson,  namely, that it does  not help\r                                        \r\n\nthe official appealing a denial of immunity to argue that the\r\n\ndistrict  court erred in  finding a  material issue  of fact.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nDiaz  v. Diaz  Martinez, 112  F.3d  1, 4-5  (1st Cir.  1997);\r                                   \r\n\nStella  v. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71, 77-78  (1st Cir. 1995).  True,\r                             \r\n\nsuch  an error can be described as  an error of law.  But, as\r\n\nthe  Supreme  Court  made  clear,  Johnson's  limitation   on\r                                                      \r\n\nimmediate  review rests primarily  on a prudential  desire to\r\n\navoid  bringing  evidentiary  disputes to  the  appeals court\r                                        \r\n\nexcept as  part of a final judgment.   Johnson, 115 S. Ct. at\r                                                          \r\n\n2156-58.\r\n\n     In  this case,  the  district  court  did  not  identify\r\n\nspecific  factual issues  or  explain  its  ruling,  but  its\r\n\nreasoning probably  lay along  one or  both of  two different\r\n\nlines:  that disputed  incidents trivial in  themselves might\r\n\nadd up to something  more sinister as part  of a pattern,  or\r\n\nthat  some of  the  incidents (such  as  the later  withdrawn\r\n\ndischarge  of Tang in 1989)  might not be  so trivial at all.\r\n\nNeither  theory is impossible  in the  abstract.   See, e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nCarter v. Rhode Island, 68 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir. 1995).\r                                  \r\n\n     Whether  the evidence adduced by Tang created a material\r\n\nissue of fact under summary judgment standards is a different\r\n\nquestion; to  decide it,  we would have  to describe  in some\r\n\ndetail  the events  cited by  Tang and  the inferences  as to\r\n\ndefendants' intent  that might, or  might not, be  drawn from\r\n\nthe episodes alleged.   But this is the  very type of factual\r\n\ndispute  that  Johnson  holds  to  be  premature  so  far  as\r                                  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nappellate  review is concerned.  Right or wrong, the district\r\n\ncourt's ruling is not subject to immediate appeal.  \r\n\n     The defendants counter by saying that  subjective intent\r\n\nis irrelevant to  qualified immunity.  They  concede arguendo\r                                                                         \r\n\neach  of the  few incidents  directly  involving them  (e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nMaigret's  allegedly   inadequate  investigation   of  Tang's\r\n\ncomplaint that  another department  employee demanded  to use\r\n\nTang's computer although other machines were available).  But\r\n\ndrawing upon the Harlow-Anderson objective  test of qualified\r                                            \r\n\nimmunity, they  say that  no reasonable  person could  regard\r\n\nthese actions as unlawful discrimination.\r\n\n     We  think that  the Harlow-Anderson objective  test does\r                                                    \r\n\nnot  automatically resolve  a qualified  immunity  defense in\r\n\nfavor   of  the  defendant  in  a   case  of  alleged  racial\r\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation.   The essence of  such claims,\r\n\nor  at least one  standard version, is  that official actions\r\n\nthat  might  otherwise  be  defended  as   reasonable  become\r\n\nillegitimate when taken out of  racial bias or in revenge for\r\n\na prior complaint.   See Alexis v. McDonald's  Restaurants of\r                                                                         \r\n\nMass., Inc., 67 F.3d 341, 354 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing cases).\r                       \r\n\nTo employ a wholly objective test would wipe out many, if not\r\n\nmost, of these claims.\r\n\n     The  objective test focuses on the reasonableness of the\r\n\nofficial's conduct independent of motive.  It is rarely going\r\n\nto be manifestly  unreasonable, judged apart from  motive, to\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n\nassign  particular  tasks  to  an  employee,  move  her  file\r\n\ncabinet, alter  her parking  arrangements or  do most  of the\r\n\nthings  of  which Tang  complains.   But  because  of special\r\n\nconstitutional  or statutory  protections,  some motives  can\r                                                            \r\n\nconvert relatively minor slights into causes of action.   Cf.\r                                                                         \r\n\nRutan v.

In all events, the circuit courts\r\n\nhave almost uniformly  refused to apply a  strictly objective\r\n\ntest of qualified  immunity in racial and  retaliation cases.\r\n\nSee Broderick v. Roache, 996 F.2d 1294, 1298 (1st Cir. 1993);\r                                   \r\n\nCrawford-El, 93 F.3d at 817 (citing cases). \r                       \r\n\n     The  defendants  strongly  suggest that  the  failure to\r\n\nallow an appeal now, in a  case like this one, will  undercut\r\n\nthe protection that qualified immunity is supposed to give to\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     1The Supreme Court may clarify matters next fall when it\r\nconfronts a qualified immunity defense offered to a charge of\r\nretaliatory  motive.

Of course,  nothing\r\n\nprevents  a district court from granting summary judgment for\r\n\nthe defendants where proof of  a racial or retaliatory motive\r\n\nis very  thin.  But  this does not help  government officials\r\n\nseeking an early  exit where the  district court thinks  that\r\n\nfactual issues remain, for, in that event, Johnson still bars\r                                                              \r\n\nan immediate appeal.\r\n\n     Johnson involved a factual dispute  about what occurred,\r                        \r\n\nnot an issue of motive,  and its full implications for motive\r\n\ncases may not have been  entirely apparent.

The  problem for\r\n\nofficials facing such lawsuits is very real.\r\n\n     In a few circuits, it appears that courts have responded\r\n\nby  squeezing   Johnson  a   bit  and  effectively   granting\r                                   \r\n\ninterlocutory review  of denials of qualified  immunity based\r\n\non  alleged factual disputes  about intent; but  this circuit\r\n\nand  a number  of others  have resisted  that course.2   More\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Compare  Walker  v.

In the district  court, Maureen\r                                      \r\n\nMaigret and Susan  Sweet moved for summary  judgment, arguing\r\n\nthat Rhoda Tang's  claim against them under 42  U.S.C.   1983\r\n\nwas barred  by qualified immunity.   The district  court held\r\n\nthat  factual  disputes precluded  summary  judgment on  this\r\n\nissue,  and Maigret  and Sweet  have  taken an  interlocutory\r\n\nappeal   to  this  court.    Under  governing  Supreme  Court\r\n\nprecedent, we are obliged to dismiss the appeal on procedural\r\n\ngrounds.\r\n\n     Tang, an Asian  American, has worked as a  public health\r\n\nnutritionist  at  the  Rhode  Island  Department  of  Elderly\r\n\nAffairs  since  1974.    In  her  view,  the  Department  has\r\n\ndiscriminated  against  her  for   many  years,  in   various\r\n\nrespects, primarily on  account of her race.   The history of\r\n\nlitigation includes a formal administrative charge by Tang of\r\n\nemployment discrimination and  a settlement of the  matter in\r\n\n1987, and Tang's 1989 discharge and 1992 reinstatement, which\r\n\nfollowed union-initiated arbitration.\r\n\n     In 1996, Tang filed the present action in district court\r\n\nagainst  the Department,  Maigret  (former  director  of  the\r\n\nDepartment), and Sweet  (then the associate director).   Tang\r\n\ncharged  that she had  been discriminated against  for racial\r\n\nand other  reasons in the  conditions of  her employment  and\r\n\nalso  had been  subjected to  retaliation on  account  of her\r\n\nprior  complaint.   Her claims  were based  on Title  VII, 42\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nU.S.C.     2000e-2 and 3, on 42 U.S.C.     1981 and 1983, and\r\n\non counterpart provisions of Rhode Island law.\r\n\n     After some  preliminary skirmishing,  Maigret and  Sweet\r\n\nmoved  for summary  judgment  as to  the  section 1983  claim\r\n\nagainst them on grounds of qualified immunity.  They conceded\r\n\nthat there  was a clearly  established right to be  free from\r\n\nracial  discrimination.     But,   relying  upon   Harlow  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nFitzgerald,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110763\"><a href=\"/opinion/110763/harlow-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  819  (1982),  and  Anderson  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nCreighton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111953\"><a href=\"/opinion/111953/anderson-v-creighton/\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,  638-39 (1987), they argued  that an\r                     \r\n\nobjectively  reasonable  person  would  not  think  that  the\r\n\nconduct attributed to them by Tang violated that right.  \r\n\n     Some  of  the incidents  cited  by Tang  as  examples of\r\n\nracial discrimination or retaliation would strike many people\r\n\nas tame  (for example, that  she was given too  many clerical\r\n\ntasks); others might be more  serious.  But Maigret and Sweet\r\n\nsought  to  narrow  the  focus  by  asserting that  each  was\r\n\ndirectly linked only to one  or two incidents.  Tang answered\r\n\nthat  factual  issues,  including   the  defendants'  alleged\r\n\ndiscriminatory intent, precluded summary judgment.\r\n\n     In October 1996,  the district court filed  a memorandum\r\n\nand  order  concluding  that  \"the  [individual]  defendants'\r\n\nmotion for qualified immunity must  be and is hereby deferred\r\n\nuntil completion of the trial  of the plaintiff's case.\"  The\r\n\ncourt  declined to \"detai[l] the allegations the parties have\r\n\nmade\" but  explained: \"It suffices  to say that I  agree with\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nplaintiff's counsel that  the vast majority of the  facts are\r\n\nin dispute.\"  This appeal followed.\r\n\n     Although  Tang defends the district court's order on the\r\n\nmerits, she also says that we have no authority to review the\r\n\ndistrict court's order.   The objection, couched  in language\r\n\ntaken from a recent Supreme  Court case, is that \"a defendant\r\n\nentitled  to  invoke  a qualified  immunity  defense  may not\r\n\nappeal a  district court  summary judgment  order insofar  as\r\n\nthat order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets\r\n\nforth a `genuine issue of fact  for trial.'\"  See Johnson  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nJones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117950\"><a href=\"/opinion/117950/johnson-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But this is the  very type of factual\r\n\ndispute  that  Johnson  holds  to  be  premature  so  far  as\r                                  \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nappellate  review is concerned.  Right or wrong, the district\r\n\ncourt's ruling is not subject to immediate appeal.  \r\n\n     The defendants counter by saying that  subjective intent\r\n\nis irrelevant to  qualified immunity.  They  concede arguendo\r                                                                         \r\n\neach  of the  few incidents  directly  involving them  (e.g.,\r                                                                        \r\n\nMaigret's  allegedly   inadequate  investigation   of  Tang's\r\n\ncomplaint that  another department  employee demanded  to use\r\n\nTang's computer although other machines were available).  But\r\n\ndrawing upon the Harlow-Anderson objective  test of qualified\r                                            \r\n\nimmunity, they  say that  no reasonable  person could  regard\r\n\nthese actions as unlawful discrimination.\r\n\n     We  think that  the Harlow-Anderson objective  test does\r                                                    \r\n\nnot  automatically resolve  a qualified  immunity  defense in\r\n\nfavor   of  the  defendant  in  a   case  of  alleged  racial\r\n\ndiscrimination or retaliation.

Of course,  nothing\r\n\nprevents  a district court from granting summary judgment for\r\n\nthe defendants where proof of  a racial or retaliatory motive\r\n\nis very  thin.  But  this does not help  government officials\r\n\nseeking an early  exit where the  district court thinks  that\r\n\nfactual issues remain, for, in that event, Johnson still bars\r                                                              \r\n\nan immediate appeal.\r\n\n     Johnson involved a factual dispute  about what occurred,\r                        \r\n\nnot an issue of motive,  and its full implications for motive\r\n\ncases may not have been  entirely apparent.

The  problem for\r\n\nofficials facing such lawsuits is very real.\r\n\n     In a few circuits, it appears that courts have responded\r\n\nby  squeezing   Johnson  a   bit  and  effectively   granting\r                                   \r\n\ninterlocutory review  of denials of qualified  immunity based\r\n\non  alleged factual disputes  about intent; but  this circuit\r\n\nand  a number  of others  have resisted  that course.2   More\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n     2Compare  Walker  v.
