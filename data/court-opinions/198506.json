Juan M.

Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its\r\ndiscretion in dismissing the complaint for failure to\r\nprosecute.  We reach this conclusion essentially for the\r\nreasons stated by the district court in its Opinion and Order\r\ndated August 11, 1998.  Plaintiff's long-standing inactivity,\r\nin addition to his failure to respond to defendants'\r\ndispositive motion, justified the dismissal.  See John's\r\nInsulation, Inc. v. L. Addison &amp; Assoc., Inc., 156 F.3d 101,\r\n108-10 (1st Cir. 1998).  Plaintiff's insufficient excuses and\r\nundeveloped appellate arguments do not convince us otherwise.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
