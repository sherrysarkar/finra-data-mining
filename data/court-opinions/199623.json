Gibson, of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f-2-\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. Rasac Olufemi Opere, a native and\n\ncitizen of Nigeria, was admitted to the United States on November 13,\n\n1982 as a nonimmigrant visitor with authorization to remain in the\n\ncountry until November 30, 1982. Having remained in the United States\n\nbeyond the authorized date, Opere was given an Order to Show Cause\n\n(\"OSC\") by the INS on April 14, 1994 and was charged as being\n\ndeportable pursuant to Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") §\n\n211(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B) (current version at 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1227(a)(1)(B)). In the deportation proceedings before an immigration\n\njudge, Opere admitted all allegations contained in the OSC and conceded\n\ndeportability.     For relief from deportation, Opere applied for\n\nsuspension of deportation and sought voluntary departure and\n\ntermination of proceedings. The immigration judge denied the relief,\n\nfinding that because he had previously lied under oath to an\n\nimmigration official during a green card interview, Opere was\n\nstatutorily precluded from demonstrating good moral character as\n\nrequired for a suspension of deportation. The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"Board\") upheld the immigration judge's decision, and this\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                FACTS\n\n          On June 7, 1993, Opere married Alana Rose, a United States\n\ncitizen. By December of that year, they were separated and not living\n\ntogether: Opere was living at 53 Pine Street and Alana was living with\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fher sister. On December 27, 1993, Alana filed a Petition for Alien\n\nRelative, commonly referred to as a \"green card,\" for Opere based on\n\ntheir marriage. Alana and Opere were interviewed under oath, together\n\nand individually, on February 28, 1994 by Immigration Officer Higgins.\n\nDuring that interview, Opere and Alana each told Higgins that they were\n\nliving together at 53 Pine Street. Alana, however, later recanted and,\n\non February 28, 1994, withdrew the green card petition on the basis\n\nthat she and Opere were in fact separated as of December 1993. The INS\n\nsubsequently denied the petition.\n\n          During his deportation proceeding before the immigration\n\njudge, Opere testified about his marriage interview with Officer\n\nHiggins. Opere testified that at the beginning of the interview, he\n\nwas placed under oath. When asked by counsel for the government why he\n\nhad falsely testified that he and Alana were living together, Opere\n\nstated, \"I was afraid I want everything to work together, and I know if\n\nI tell him we were not living together, I don't know what he is going\n\nto -- I lied.\" Counsel for the government then asked whether he lied\n\nbecause he thought Higgins would deny the green card if he knew that\n\nOpere and his wife were not living together.        Opere answered, \"Yes.\"\n\n          In a decision dated July 20, 1995, the immigration judge\n\nfound Opere deportable as charged, denied his application for\n\nsuspension of deportation and his request for termination of\n\nproceedings and voluntary departure, and ordered him deported to\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fNigeria. In evaluating the requirements under the INA for suspension\n\nof deportation, the immigration judge found that Opere had established\n\nseven years of continuous physical presence, but was unable to\n\ndemonstrate that he was a person of good moral character and that\n\ndeportation would result in extreme hardship to either himself or his\n\nestranged wife. With respect to her determination regarding good moral\n\ncharacter in particular,1 the judge found that Opere was statutorily\n\nprecluded under INA § 101(f) (6) from receiving suspension of\n\ndeportation proceedings because he lied under oath to an immigration\n\nofficer during the time period in which he was required to demonstrate\n\ngood moral character.\n\n           Opere appealed the immigration judge's decision to the Board\n\non July 24, 1995. In his appeal, Opere argued that he did not provide\n\nfalse testimony within the meaning of § 101(f)(6) because he\n\neffectively \"recanted\" the untruthful testimony when his wife admitted\n\nthat they were not residing together and because the testimony itself\n\nwas not material. The Board rejected both of these arguments on the\n\ngrounds that it was Opere's wife, not Opere, that had recanted that\n\nfalse testimony and that § 101(f)(6) does not impose a materiality\n\nrequirement. The Board considered Opere's admission that he lied to\n\nthe immigration officer because he was afraid that his green card would\n\nbe denied and found that Opere \"plainly had the subjective belief that\n\n1   The decision on this ground is the only issue presented on appeal.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fhis false statement would assist him in obtaining immigration\n\nbenefits.\" The Board thus concluded that Opere was statutorily barred\n\nby § 101(f)(6) from establishing that he was a person of good moral\n\ncharacter and dismissed his appeal for a suspension of deportation.2\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n           The law in this case is straightforward. The granting of an\n\napplication for suspension of deportation under the INA requires a\n\nfinding of statutory eligibility as well as an exercise of agency\n\ndiscretion. Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 60-61 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nAn alien is statutorily eligible for deportation if he: (1) has been\n\nphysically present in the United States for a continuous period of not\n\nless than seven years immediately preceding the application for\n\nsuspension; (2) is a person of \"good moral character\"; and (3) is \"a\n\nperson whose deportation would, in the opinion of the Attorney general,\n\nresult in extreme hardship to the alien or to her spouse, parent, or\n\nchild, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully\n\nadmitted for permanent residence.\"      INA § 244(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1254(a)(1) (repealed 1996).3 Section 101(f) of the Act, in turn,\n\nidentifies eight categories of conduct that render an individual per se\n\nlacking in good moral character. Because a decision to deny suspension\n\n\n\n2   The Board sustained Opere's appeal for voluntary departure.\n3 Though repealed, this provision still applies to this case. See\nBernal-Vallejo, 195 F.3d at 60 n.1.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fof deportation on these grounds is a non-discretionary question of\n\nfact, we review it for \"substantial evidence.\" Under this standard,\n\nthe Board's determination \"must be upheld if 'supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.'\" Mendes v. INS, 197 F.3d 6, 13 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing INS v.\n\nElías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).\n\n          Here, the immigration judge found Opere statutorily\n\nineligible for suspension of deportation based on § 101(f)(6). This\n\ncategory provides that:\n\n          No person shall be regarded as, or found to be,\n          a person of good moral character who, during the\n          period for which good moral character is to be\n          established, is, or was . . . one who has given\n          false testimony for the purpose of obtaining any\n          immigration benefits.\n\nINA § 101(f)(6), 8 U.S.C. 1101(f)(6). \"Testimony,\" for purposes of §\n\n101(f)(6), includes any statement made under oath. Kungys v. United\n\nStates, 485 U.S. 759, 781 (1988).      If an individual makes such\n\nstatements with the \"subjective intent of obtaining immigration\n\nbenefits,\" he or she is statutorily precluded from establishing good\n\nmoral character under this provision.      Id.\n\n          Opere does not contest that his marriage interview took place\n\nwithin the relevant time period, namely, seven years. In his testimony\n\nbefore the immigration judge, moreover, Opere testified that he was\n\nplaced under oath at the beginning of that interview, that he lied\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fabout his living arrangements, and that he did so out of fear that if\n\nhe told the truth, he would be denied a green card. Opere argues, as\n\nhe did below, that the government failed to establish that his false\n\ntestimony was material. However, as the Board correctly concluded, §\n\n101(f)(6) imposes no materiality requirement. Id. at 779-80. Rather,\n\nthe provision \"denominates a person to be of bad moral character on\n\naccount of having told even the most immaterial of lies with the\n\nsubjective intent of obtaining immigration or naturalization benefits.\"\n\nId. Accordingly, we believe there is sufficient evidence in the record\n\nto uphold the Board's determination that Opere was statutorily\n\nineligible from establishing good moral character for a suspension of\n\ndeportation.\n\n          Opere raises two additional arguments on appeal. First,\n\nOpere states that the government offered no evidence establishing that\n\nhe was actually under oath when he lied. He also claims that he lied\n\nbecause he was surprised by Officer Higgins' confrontation, not because\n\nhe believed that it would enhance his chances of securing a green card.\n\nIn addition to contradicting his own testimony before the immigration\n\njudge, these arguments were never raised before the Board. They are\n\nconsequently waived for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\nSee Bernal-Vallejo, 195 F.3d at 64.\n\n          The decision of the Board is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",
