We have carefully reviewed the record on\r\n\nappeal and affirm on grounds of issue preclusion. In a prior\r\n\nsuit, the appellant was given the opportunity to fully litigate\r\n\nthe issue of whether his claims are cognizable under the Civil\r\n\nRights Act. The judgment against the appellant in the prior\r\n\nsuit bars him from re-litigating the issue here.\r\n\n          Affirmed. Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n\n   The appellant's motion for oral argument is hereby denied.\r\nOral argument would not advance the decisional process.   See\r\n1st Cir. Loc. R. 34.1.\r\n\n                             -2-\r\n",
