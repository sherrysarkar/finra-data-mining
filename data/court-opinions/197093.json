We are summoned again to  survey\r                    SELYA, Circuit Judge.\r                                        \r\n\nthe battleground on which  plaintiff-appellant Arthur T. Cottrill\r\n\nhas  been struggling  to  recover his  beneficial  interest in  a\r\n\nprofit-sharing  plan maintained by  his former employer, Sparrow,\r\n\nJohnson &amp;  Ursillo, Inc. (SJU).1   In our first visit  to the war\r\n\nzone we determined that  Cottrill was not a fiduciary  within the\r\n\ncontemplation  of  the  Employee Retirement  Income  Security Act\r\n\n(ERISA),  29 U.S.C.      1001-1461 (1994),  and specifically,  29\r\n\nU.S.C.   1002(21)(A).   See Cottrill v. SJU, 74  F.3d 20, 22 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1996).  We therefore reversed the district court's  contrary\r\n\nruling  and remanded  for  the entry  of  judgment in  Cottrill's\r\n\nfavor.  See id.\r                         \r\n\n          The  entry of  judgment  did not  end the  hostilities.\r\n\nCottrill  appeals anew,  this time  contending that  the district\r\n\ncourt  abused its  discretion by  (1) miscalculating  prejudgment\r\n\ninterest, and (2) denying him attorneys' fees.  We affirm.\r\n\n                                I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n                        Setting the Stage\r                                  Setting the Stage\r                                                   \r\n\n          We refrain  from rehearsing the facts  for two reasons.\r\n\nFirst,  they are adequately stated  in our earlier  opinion.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at 21.  Second, the questions that Cottrill now raises do not\r             \r\n\npertain directly to  the merits  of his cause,  but concern  only\r\n\nembellishments to the judgment.  Thus, after pausing to elucidate\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  defendants in  this case  are SJU,  its profit-sharing\r\nplan (the  Plan), and Steven  J. Ursillo  (SJU's chief  executive\r\nofficer and the Plan's trustee).  For simplicity's sake, we refer\r\nto them collectively as \"the trustee\" or \"the defendants.\"\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nthe standard of review, we proceed immediately to the appellant's\r\n\nasseverational array.\r\n\n          Both  prejudgment  interest  and  attorneys'  fees  are\r\n\navailable,  but not obligatory, in  ERISA cases.  See Quesinberry\r                                                                           \r\n\nv. Life  Ins. Co. of N.

An  appellate court\r\n\nreviews  the grant  or denial  of  prejudgment interest  in ERISA\r\n\ncases  solely for  abuse of  discretion.   See Smith  v. American\r                                                                           \r\n\nInt'l  Life Assurance  Co., 50  F.3d 956,  957 (11th  Cir. 1995);\r                                    \r\n\nAnthuis  v.

The same  standard of review  obtains in connection\r\n\nwith rulings granting or denying applications for attorneys' fees\r\n\nunder 29 U.S.C.   1132(g)(1).   See Thorpe v. Retirement Plan  of\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe Pillsbury Co., 80 F.3d 439, 445 (10th Cir. 1996); Gray v.

This judicial  discretion\r\n\nencompasses not only  the overarching question   whether to award\r\n\nprejudgment interest at all   but also  subsidiary questions that\r\n\narise after the court decides to make an award, including matters\r\n\nsuch as the period and  rate to be used in  calculating interest.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Smith, 50 F.3d at 958.\r                          \r\n\n          In   this   instance,   the  district   court   awarded\r\n\nprejudgment interest, but,  in Cottrill's  estimation, the  court\r\n\nchose an unrealistic accrual  date (thereby truncating the period\r\n\nfor which it allowed  interest) and then compounded the  error by\r\n\nselecting too miserly an interest rate.  We address each of these\r\n\ncomplaints in turn.\r\n\n          1.  The Date of Accrual.  Ordinarily, a cause of action\r                    1.  The Date of Accrual.\r                                           \r\n\nunder  ERISA and  prejudgment  interest on  a plan  participant's\r\n\nclaim both accrue when a fiduciary denies a participant benefits.\r\n\nSee, e.g., Larsen v.

Setting the accrual date in this manner not only advances\r\n\nthe general  purposes of prejudgment interest,  see West Virginia\r                                                                           \r\n\nv.

Figuring the accrual date  in this way also\r\n\nprevents  unjust enrichment.    See Sweet  v.

Central\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates, Southeast &amp; Southwest  Areas Pension Fund, 729 F.2d  567,\r                                                           \r\n\n576 (8th Cir. 1984).\r\n\n          Cottrill asserts  that his  cause of action  accrued on\r\n\nDecember 12, 1990, when  the lawyer who was handling  his divorce\r\n\nsent a letter  to the  Plan inquiring into  the availability  and\r\n\nvalue of Cottrill's beneficial interest.   The district court saw\r\n\nmatters differently; it found that the cause of action accrued on\r\n\nDecember  31,  1991,   when  the  trustee   erroneously  declared\r\n\nCottrill's funds forfeit.\r\n\n          The  district court's  reasoning  is  persuasive.   The\r\n\nattorney's letter cannot reasonably be construed  as a demand for\r\n\nfunds.     It  was  an  inquiry  for  the  purpose  of  providing\r\n\ninformation necessary to the  divorce pavane   no more,  no less.\r\n\nThe defendants' response to  this letter confirms our assessment.\r\n\nNeither in  language nor  in  tone does  it presume  to deny  any\r\n\napplication  for benefits,  but,  rather,  merely  indicates  the\r\n\namounts involved  and when  particular assets would  be available\r\n\nfor distribution.\r\n\n          Once  past  the lawyer's  letter, the  district court's\r\n\ndetermination that the defendants did not deprive Cottrill of his\r\n\nbenefits until  they  offset his  account  on December  31,  1991\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\n(ostensibly to recoup losses that he occasioned, see Cottrill, 74\r                                                                       \r\n\nF.3d at 21)  is virtually  inevitable.2  Hence,  the court  acted\r\n\nwell within  its discretion in finding  that prejudgment interest\r\n\nbegan to accrue on that date.\r\n\n    2.  The Rate of Interest.  ERISA provides for postjudgment\r              2.  The Rate of Interest.\r                                      \r\n\ninterest  to be  calculated  at the  federal  rate, 28  U.S.C.   \r\n\n1961(a)  (1994),  but  it  contains  no  explicit  provision  for\r\n\nprejudgment  interest.   Here,  the district  court employed  the\r\n\nfederal statutory  rate for that  purpose.  The  appellant argues\r\n\nthat the court  should have used  the (somewhat more  munificent)\r\n\nrate available under Rhode Island  law.  See R.I. Gen. Laws    9-\r                                                      \r\n\n21-10 (1985) (stipulating  a flat rate of 12% per  annum).  We do\r\n\nnot  think that  the district  court exceeded  its  discretion in\r\n\nchoosing the federal rate.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The appellant  disputes the district court's  finding that,\r\nprior  to year's  end,  the appellant's  money continued  to earn\r\ninterest.   We  have  two  reactions.    First,  the  finding  is\r\nunnecessary to the result,  for it is  the fact that the  account\r\nremained  untouched, coupled  with  the absence  of a  meaningful\r\nturnover demand at an earlier time, that renders the December 31,\r\n1991  date  defensible.    Second,  the  court  relied  upon  the\r\nrepresentations  of SJU's  counsel (uncontradicted  by Cottrill's\r\nlawyer)  in making this ore tenus finding and invited Cottrill to\r                                           \r\nseek to modify the order if these representations were erroneous.\r\nCottrill  never accepted  the invitation.   Therefore,  he cannot\r\ncomplain  of  the finding  here.    See  Dow  v. United  Bhd.  of\r                                                                           \r\nCarpenters &amp; Joiners, 1  F.3d 56, 61-62 (1st Cir.  1993) (holding\r                              \r\nthat  a  party  who  eschewed  the  court's  invitation  to  seek\r\ndiscovery  if needed waived  any subsequent objection  to lack of\r\ndiscovery);  Reilly v.

Of  course,  if the  particular  federal\r\n\nstatute  is   silent,  courts   have  discretion  to   select  an\r\n\nappropriate rate, and they may look to outside sources, including\r\n\nstate law, for  guidance.

Because  ERISA is inscrutable\r                                            \r\n\non the subject, a court that elects to award prejudgment interest\r\n\nin an  ERISA case has broad  discretion in choosing a  rate.

In  such  a situation,  equitable considerations  should\r\n\nguide the exercise of  judicial discretion.  See, e.g.,  Kinek v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nParamount Communications, Inc., 22 F.3d 503, 514  (2d Cir. 1994);\r                                        \r\n\nAnthuis, 971 F.2d at 1009.\r                 \r\n\n          The  appellant insists  that the  lower court  departed\r\n\nfrom \"clear  federal appellate court precedent\"  favoring the use\r\n\nof state prejudgment interest rates in ERISA cases.

Supp. 891, 895 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).\r                 \r\n\n          We need not tarry.   The law confers discretion  on the\r\n\ntrial  judge, not on the court of  appeals.  In this instance the\r\n\njudge  chose  to  use  the federal  statutory  rate  in computing\r\n\nprejudgment interest.  Utilizing this rate promotes uniformity in\r\n\nERISA  cases.   Furthermore,  the  federal rate  is  an objective\r\n\nmeasure of  the value of  money over  time, and the  record makes\r\n\nmanifest  that, in  selecting it,  the district  judge considered\r\n\nboth the  rationale of  full compensation and  ERISA's underlying\r\n\ngoals.    We  note, too,  that  the  federal  rate is  especially\r\n\nappropriate in this case because the Plan's funds  were initially\r\n\ninvested in Treasury bills.   See, e.g., Algie,  891 F. Supp.  at\r                                                        \r\n\n899  (finding the federal  rate appropriate when  it more closely\r\n\napproximated the likely return  on the funds withheld).   Mindful\r\n\nof these realities,  we do not think that equity  demands the use\r\n\nof a higher rate.\r\n\n                                B.\r                                          B.\r                                            \r\n\n                           Counsel Fees\r                                     Counsel Fees\r                                                 \r\n\n          The appellant  also challenges  the  denial of  counsel\r\n\nfees.  Congress declared that, in  any ERISA claim advanced by  a\r\n\n\"participant,  beneficiary,  or  fiduciary,   the  court  in  its\r\n\ndiscretion  may  allow  a   reasonable  attorney's  fee\"  to  the\r\n\nprevailing party.   29 U.S.C.    1132(g)(1).   Unlike other  fee-\r\n\nshifting  statutes,  however,  ERISA   does  not  provide  for  a\r\n\nvirtually  automatic  award  of  attorneys'  fees  to  prevailing\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\nplaintiffs.     Instead,  fee  awards  under   ERISA  are  wholly\r\n\ndiscretionary.  See Gray, 792 F.2d at 259.\r                                  \r\n\n          This discretion  is not  standardless.  To  channel its\r\n\nexercise,  this   court  has   cited  five  basic   factors  that\r\n\ncustomarily should be weighed in the  balance:  (1) the degree of\r\n\nculpability or  bad faith attributable  to the losing  party; (2)\r\n\nthe depth of the losing party's pocket, i.e., his or her capacity\r\n\nto  pay an award;  (3) the  extent (if at  all) to which  such an\r\n\naward   would   deter   other  persons   acting   under   similar\r\n\ncircumstances; (4) the benefit (if any) that the successful  suit\r\n\nconfers on plan participants  or beneficiaries generally; and (5)\r\n\nthe relative merit of the parties' positions.

Although Smith  quotes\r                                                                   \r\nliberally from a  civil rights case, see id. at  589, the opinion\r                                                      \r\ndoes not suggest the  use of a mandatory presumption,  but merely\r\napplies  the five  basic  factors in  light  of ERISA's  remedial\r\npurposes.     See  Eddy,  59  F.3d  at  207  (reaching  the  same\r                                 \r\nconclusion).\r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nexplicitly  rejected the  creation of a  presumption in  favor of\r\n\nprevailing defendants.   792 F.2d at 258.  We pointed out that 29\r\n\nU.S.C.    1132(g)(1) speaks in discretionary  terms, and that its\r\n\nlegislative   history,  unlike  that   of  certain  civil  rights\r\n\nstatutes, does not support  a presumption via- -vis counsel fees.\r\n\nSee Gray, 792 F.2d at 258-59.  This rationale suggests to us that\r                  \r\n\na presumption in  favor of  prevailing plaintiffs  also would  be\r\n\noverkill;  because the five basic factors have a built-in bias in\r\n\nfavor  of prevailing  plaintiffs, see  id. (recognizing  that the\r                                                    \r\n\nsecond, third, and fourth factors may favor prevailing plaintiffs\r\n\nmoreso than  prevailing  defendants), the  superimposition  of  a\r\n\npresumption  seems  unnecessary  as  a means  of  protecting  the\r\n\nlegitimate interests of plan beneficiaries and participants.\r\n\n          2.  Validity of the Order.  Having declined to employ a\r                    2.  Validity of the Order.\r                                             \r\n\nmandatory presumption, we turn now to the district court's order.\r\n\nThe appellant contends that  the court mishandled the  five basic\r\n\nfactors.  This contention lacks force.\r\n\n          In terms of the first factor   culpability   the record\r\n\ncontains no  indication that the defendants  exhibited bad faith;\r\n\nthey   consulted   with  counsel   and   conducted  a   year-long\r\n\ninvestigation before offsetting Cottrill's  account.  Thus,  even\r\n\nthough the Plan  was ultimately found  liable under the  statute,\r\n\nthe worst that  can be  said is that  the defendants,  confronted\r\n\nwith a sizeable loss  attributable to the appellant's imprudence,\r\n\nmisjudged the Plan's legal rights.\r\n\n          The district judge made an additional point,  referring\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nto his original  finding that Cottrill  was the person  primarily\r\n\nresponsible for  the Plan's  substantial losses and  deeming this\r\n\nfact relevant to  the issue of attorneys' fees.4   This is out of\r\n\nthe ordinary, for the traditional formulation of the first factor\r\n\nsuggests an inquiry into the bad faith or culpability only of the\r\n\nlosing party.   Still, on the  odd facts of this  case, we cannot\r\n\nsay that the district court's emphasis  on the prevailing party's\r\n\nculpability constitutes  an abuse of discretion.   Cf. Armistead,\r                                                                          \r\n\n944 F.2d  at 1304 (finding no abuse  of discretion in the absence\r\n\nof a showing that  consideration of other factors would  have led\r\n\nto a different result).  At the very least, Cottrill's conduct is\r\n\ngermane as an additional    and significant   circumstance  to be\r\n\nconsidered  under the  flexible standard  that governs  ERISA fee\r\n\napplications.  See, e.g., Anthuis, 971 F.2d at 1012.\r                                           \r\n\n          The  second factor  is a  non-starter.   While evidence\r\n\nexisted that the  defendants had funds  available and could  have\r\n\nafforded to  pay  the appellant's  fees,  this datum  has  little\r\n\nrelevance  here.   An  inability to  afford  attorneys' fees  may\r\n\ncounsel  against an award, see  Armistead, 944 F.2d  at 1305, but\r                                                   \r\n\nthe capacity to  pay, by itself,  does not justify an  award, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nThorpe, 80 F.3d  at 445; Tiemeyer v.

The court reasoned that an award of fees might deter\r\n\nthe wrongful withholding of  accounts by fiduciaries, but that  a\r\n\ndenial of  fees might  deter participants and  beneficiaries from\r\n\nacting  recklessly in respect  to the assets  of employee benefit\r\n\nplans.   The  appellant  does not  make  any convincing  counter-\r\n\nargument.  While we  recognize the deterrent value of  fee awards\r\n\nagainst errant fiduciaries and attach considerable weight to such\r\n\ndeterrence,  we discern  no  reason on  these peculiar  facts for\r\n\nrejecting  the  district court's  analysis  of  deterrence as  an\r\n\nelement  here.  Given  the trial court's  superior vantage point,\r\n\nits  evaluative judgments  about such  case-specific matters  are\r\n\nentitled to substantial respect.\r\n\n          The fourth factor    common benefit   cuts  against the\r\n\nappellant.   His  situation  is both  exotic and  fact-dependent;\r\n\nthus,  other  participants  do  not  stand  to  profit  from  the\r\n\nappellant's  success.   This  lack  of  other similarly  situated\r\n\nparticipants  militates against a fee award.  See Custer, 12 F.3d\r                                                                  \r\n\nat 423.\r\n\n          Last  but  not  least,  we address  the  merits  of the\r\n\nunderlying suit.   We agree  with the court  below that the  case\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\npresented a close question.5   The very fact that  an experienced\r\n\ntrial judge originally found in  the defendants' favor argues for\r\n\na  finding  that  the  defendants  had  a  reasonable  basis  for\r\n\ncontesting Cottrill's entitlement to  the funds, even though this\r\n\ncourt  ultimately  ruled  against  them.    Cf.  Sierra  Club  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nSecretary  of the  Army,  820  F.2d  513,  519  (1st  Cir.  1987)\r                                 \r\n\n(acknowledging  in an  EAJA case  that a  party's success  in the\r\n\ndistrict court is some evidence that its position was justified);\r\n\nPorter  v. Heckler, 780 F.2d 920, 922 (11th Cir. 1986) (similar).\r                            \r\n\nThe fifth factor, then, is something of a wash.\r\n\n          The bottom line is that  the district court applied the\r\n\nconventional five-factor  test in an acceptable  manner and added\r\n\nidiosyncratic  features to  it in  a reasonable  way.   The court\r\n\nrecognized that  a  successful plaintiff  in an  ERISA case  more\r\n\noften than  not should recover attorneys' fees, but concluded for\r\n\nreasons fully articulated in  the record that this claim  fell on\r\n\nthe other side of the border.  If  writing on a pristine page, we\r\n\nmight have weighed the mix  of factors differently   but  that is\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5In our prior opinion  we wrote that \"there was  no possible\r\nbasis for the  [district] court's conclusion that  Cottrill was a\r\nfiduciary.\"   Cottrill, 74 F.3d at 22.  The appellant seizes upon\r                                \r\nthis remark as proof that the merits were open and shut.  But the\r\nappellant wrests  this  statement from  its contextual  moorings.\r\nFairly  read, the  comment capped  the preceding  analysis which,\r\nexamined  in context,  illustrated the  uncertainty of  who is  a\r\nfiduciary under ERISA.   This  was a reasonably  close case  and,\r\njust  as  we  have warned  that  a  judicial  decision cannot  be\r\ntransmogrified  by placing  overly great  reliance on  an awkward\r\nlocution  contained  in a  trial  court's  opinion, see  Dopp  v.\r                                                                       \r\nPritzker,  38  F.3d  1239, 1244  n.5  (1st  Cir.  1994); Lenn  v.\r                                                                       \r\nPortland Sch.

Absent a mistake of  law or a clear error  in\r\n\njudgment    neither of which is  evident here   we  must defer to\r\n\nthe  trial court's  first-hand knowledge  and to  its battlefield\r\n\ndetermination that the specific facts of this case do not warrant\r\n\na fee  award.  See Florence  Nightingale, 41 F.3d at  1485; Gray,\r                                                                          \r\n\n792 F.2d at 260.\r\n\n                               III.\r                                         III.\r                                             \r\n\n                            Conclusion\r                                      Conclusion\r                                                \r\n\n          We  need go  no  further.   The  rulings of  which  the\r\n\nappellant  complains  were well  within  the realm  of  the trial\r\n\ncourt's  discretion.   The  appellant,  once  victorious, is  now\r\n\nvanquished.

Cottrill has been struggling to recover his beneficial interest in a profit-sharing plan maintained by his former employer, Sparrow, Johnson &amp; Ursillo, Inc.  (SJU).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In our first visit to the war zone we determined that Cottrill was not a fiduciary within the contemplation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1001-1461 (1994), and specifically, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A).  See Cottrill v. SJU, 74 F.3d 20, 22 (1st Cir.1996).  We therefore reversed the district court's contrary ruling and remanded for the entry of judgment in Cottrill's favor.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entry of judgment did not end the hostilities.  Cottrill appeals anew, this time contending that the district court abused its discretion by (1) miscalculating prejudgment interest, and (2) denying him attorneys' fees.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>Setting the Stage</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We refrain from rehearsing the facts for two reasons.  First, they are adequately stated in our earlier opinion.  See id. at 21.   Second, the questions that Cottrill now raises do not pertain directly to the merits of his cause, but concern only embellishments to the judgment.  Thus, after pausing to elucidate the standard of review, we proceed immediately to the appellant's asseverational array.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees are available, but not obligatory, in ERISA cases.  See Quesinberry v. Life Ins. Co. of North Am., 987 F.2d 1017, 1030 (4th Cir.1993) (en banc) (discussing prejudgment interest);  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(g)(1) (discussing attorneys' fees).  An appellate court reviews the grant or denial of prejudgment interest in ERISA cases solely for abuse of discretion.  See Smith v. American Int'l Life Assurance Co., 50 F.3d 956, 957 (11th Cir.1995);   Anthuis v. Colt Indus. Operating Corp., 971 F.2d 999, 1002 (3d Cir.1992).  The same standard of review obtains in connection with rulings granting or denying applications for attorneys' fees under 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(g)(1).  See Thorpe v. Retirement Plan of the Pillsbury Co., 80 F.3d 439, 445 (10th Cir.1996);  Gray v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 792 F.2d 251, 259 (1st Cir.1986).  Consequently, we will disturb such rulings only if the record persuades us that the trial court \"indulged a serious lapse in judgment.\"  Texaco P.R., Inc. v. Department of Consumer Affairs, 60 F.3d 867, 875 (1st Cir.1995);  accord Lutheran Med.  Ctr. of Omaha, Neb. v. Contractors, Laborers, Teamsters &amp; Eng'rs Health &amp; Welfare Plan, 25 F.3d 616, 623-24 (8th Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <p>Prejudgment Interest</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In ERISA cases the district court may grant prejudgment interest in its discretion to prevailing fiduciaries, beneficiaries, or plan participants.  This judicial discretion encompasses not only the overarching question--whether to award prejudgment interest at all--but also subsidiary questions that arise after the court decides to make an award, including matters such as the period and rate to be used in calculating interest.  See, e.g., Smith, 50 F.3d at 958.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court awarded prejudgment interest, but, in Cottrill's estimation, the court chose an unrealistic accrual date (thereby truncating the period for which it allowed interest) and then compounded the error by selecting too miserly an interest rate.  We address each of these complaints in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Date of Accrual.   Ordinarily, a cause of action under ERISA and prejudgment interest on a plan participant's claim both accrue when a fiduciary denies a participant benefits.  See, e.g., Larsen v. NMU Pension Trust, 902 F.2d 1069, 1073 (2d Cir.1990);  Paris v. Profit Sharing Plan for Employees of Howard B. Wolf, Inc., 637 F.2d 357, 361 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 836, 102 S.Ct. 140, 70 L.Ed.2d 117 (1981);  Algie v. RCA Global Communications, Inc., 891 F.Supp. 875, 899 (S.D.N.Y.1994), aff'd, 60 F.3d 956 (2d Cir.1995).  Setting the accrual date in this manner not only advances the general purposes of prejudgment interest, see West Virginia v. United States, 479 U.S. 305, 310, 107 S.Ct. 702, 706, 93 L.Ed.2d 639 (1987), but also serves ERISA's remedial objectives by making a participant whole for the period during which the fiduciary withholds money legally due.  See Diduck v. Kaszycki &amp; Sons Contractors, Inc., 974 F.2d 270, 286 (2d Cir.1992).  Figuring the accrual date in this way also prevents unjust enrichment.  See Sweet v. Consolidated Aluminum Corp., 913 F.2d 268, 270 (6th Cir.1990);  Short v. Central States, Southeast &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund, 729 F.2d 567, 576 (8th Cir.1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cottrill asserts that his cause of action accrued on December 12, 1990, when the lawyer who was handling his divorce sent a letter to the Plan inquiring into the availability and value of Cottrill's beneficial interest.  The district court saw matters differently;  it found that the cause of action accrued on December 31, 1991, when the trustee erroneously declared Cottrill's funds forfeit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reasoning is persuasive.  The attorney's letter cannot reasonably be construed as a demand for funds.  It was an inquiry for the purpose of providing information necessary to the divorce pavane--no more, no less.  The defendants' response to this letter confirms our assessment.  Neither in language nor in tone does it presume to deny any application for benefits, but, rather, merely indicates the amounts involved and when particular assets would be available for distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once past the lawyer's letter, the district court's determination that the defendants did not deprive Cottrill of his benefits until they offset his account on December 31, 1991 (ostensibly to recoup losses that he occasioned, see Cottrill, 74 F.3d at 21) is virtually inevitable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Hence, the court acted well within its discretion in finding that prejudgment interest began to accrue on that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Rate of Interest.   ERISA provides for postjudgment interest to be calculated at the federal rate, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(a) (1994), but it contains no explicit provision for prejudgment interest.  Here, the district court employed the federal statutory rate for that purpose.  The appellant argues that the court should have used the (somewhat more munificent) rate available under Rhode Island law.  See R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-21-10 (1985) (stipulating a flat rate of 12% per annum).  We do not think that the district court exceeded its discretion in choosing the federal rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, federal law governs the scope of remedies available when a claim arises under a federal statute, and this doctrine extends to the rate of prejudgment interest.  See Colon Velez v. Puerto Rico Marine Mgmt., Inc., 957 F.2d 933, 941 (1st Cir.1992).  Of course, if the particular federal statute is silent, courts have discretion to select an appropriate rate, and they may look to outside sources, including state law, for guidance.  See id.   Because ERISA is inscrutable on the subject, a court that elects to award prejudgment interest in an ERISA case has broad discretion in choosing a rate.  See Hansen v. Continental Ins. Co., 940 F.2d 971, 983-85 (5th Cir.1991).  In such a situation, equitable considerations should guide the exercise of judicial discretion.  See, e.g., Kinek v. Paramount Communications, Inc., 22 F.3d 503, 514 (2d Cir.1994);  Anthuis, 971 F.2d at 1009.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant insists that the lower court departed from \"clear federal appellate court precedent\" favoring the use of state prejudgment interest rates in ERISA cases.  He is wrong.  Although federal courts sometimes have looked to state rates for guidance, see, e.g., Hansen, 940 F.2d at 983-84, they have done so as a matter not of compulsion, but of discretion.  Indeed, the appellant's argument conveniently overlooks numerous ERISA cases in which federal appellate and district courts have approved use of the federal statutory rate for prejudgment interest.  See, e.g., Mansker v. TMG Life Ins. Co., 54 F.3d 1322, 1331 (8th Cir.1995);  Sweet, 913 F.2d at 270;  Blanton v. Anzalone, 760 F.2d 989, 992-93 (9th Cir.1985);  United States v. Mason Tenders Dist. Council, 909 F.Supp. 891, 895 (S.D.N.Y.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not tarry.  The law confers discretion on the trial judge, not on the court of appeals.  In this instance the judge chose to use the federal statutory rate in computing prejudgment interest.  Utilizing this rate promotes uniformity in ERISA cases.  Furthermore, the federal rate is an objective measure of the value of money over time, and the record makes manifest that, in selecting it, the district judge considered both the rationale of full compensation and ERISA's underlying goals.  We note, too, that the federal rate is especially appropriate in this case because the Plan's funds were initially invested in Treasury bills.  See, e.g., Algie, 891 F.Supp. at 899 (finding the federal rate appropriate when it more closely approximated the likely return on the funds withheld).  Mindful of these realities, we do not think that equity demands the use of a higher rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Counsel Fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also challenges the denial of counsel fees.  Congress declared that, in any ERISA claim advanced by a \"participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney's fee\" to the prevailing party.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(g)(1).  Unlike other fee-shifting statutes, however, ERISA does not provide for a virtually automatic award of attorneys' fees to prevailing plaintiffs.  Instead, fee awards under ERISA are wholly discretionary.  See Gray, 792 F.2d at 259.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This discretion is not standardless.  To channel its exercise, this court has cited five basic factors that customarily should be weighed in the balance:  (1) the degree of culpability or bad faith attributable to the losing party;  (2) the depth of the losing party's pocket, i.e., his or her capacity to pay an award;  (3) the extent (if at all) to which such an award would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances;  (4) the benefit (if any) that the successful suit confers on plan participants or beneficiaries generally;  and (5) the relative merit of the parties' positions.  See id. at 257-58.   Other courts of appeals have compiled strikingly similar lists.  See Eddy v. Colonial Life Ins. Co., 59 F.3d 201, 206 n. 10 (D.C.Cir.1995) (collecting cases).  The circuits agree that such compendia are exemplary rather than exclusive.  See id. at 206;  Quesinberry, 987 F.2d at 1029.   An inquiring court may--indeed, should--consider additional criteria that seem apropos in a given case.  See Anthuis, 971 F.2d at 1012.   In a word, the test for granting or denying counsel fees in an ERISA case is \"flexible.\"  Gray, 792 F.2d at 258.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Eschewing Presumptions.   Several courts of appeals have declined to adopt a mandatory presumption that attorneys' fees will be awarded to prevailing plaintiffs in ERISA cases absent special circumstances.  See Eddy, 59 F.3d at 206-07;  Florence Nightingale Nursing Serv., Inc. v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield, 41 F.3d 1476, 1485-86 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2002, 131 L.Ed.2d 1003 (1995);  McPherson v. Employees' Pension Plan of Am.  Re-Ins. Co., 33 F.3d 253, 254 (3d Cir.1994);  Custer v. Pan Am.  Life Ins. Co., 12 F.3d 410, 422 (4th Cir.1993);  Armistead v. Vernitron Corp., 944 F.2d 1287, 1302 (6th Cir.1991);  Iron Workers Local # 272 v. Bowen, 624 F.2d 1255, 1265-66 (5th Cir.1980);  see also Note, Attorney's Fees Under ERISA:  When Is an Award Appropriate?, 71 Cornell L.Rev. 1037, 1049-55 (1986) (arguing against a mandatory presumption).  There is, however, some conflicting authority.  See Landro v. Glendenning Motorways, Inc., 625 F.2d 1344, 1356 (8th Cir.1980) (applying mandatory presumption used under civil rights statutes in favor of prevailing plaintiffs in ERISA cases);  see also Bittner v. Sadoff &amp; Rudoy Indus., 728 F.2d 820, 830 (7th Cir.1984) (adapting presumption used in Equal Access to Justice Act cases to ERISA milieu).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We share the majority view.  We hold that, in an ERISA case, a prevailing plaintiff does not, merely by prevailing, create a presumption that he or she is entitled to a fee-shifting award.  Our holding flows naturally from the importance of preserving flexibility in this area of the law.  Our holding is, moreover, adumbrated by our earlier decision in Gray.   There, we explicitly rejected the creation of a presumption in favor of prevailing defendants.  792 F.2d at 258.   We pointed out that 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(g)(1) speaks in discretionary terms, and that its legislative history, unlike that of certain civil rights statutes, does not support a presumption via-a-vis counsel fees.  See Gray, 792 F.2d at 258-59.   This rationale suggests to us that a presumption in favor of prevailing plaintiffs also would be overkill;  because the five basic factors have a built-in bias in favor of prevailing plaintiffs, see id.  (recognizing that the second, third, and fourth factors may favor prevailing plaintiffs more so than prevailing defendants), the superimposition of a presumption seems unnecessary as a means of protecting the legitimate interests of plan beneficiaries and participants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Validity of the Order.   Having declined to employ a mandatory presumption, we turn now to the district court's order.  The appellant contends that the court mishandled the five basic factors.  This contention lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms of the first factor--culpability--the record contains no indication that the defendants exhibited bad faith;  they consulted with counsel and conducted a year-long investigation before offsetting Cottrill's account.  Thus, even though the Plan was ultimately found liable under the statute, the worst that can be said is that the defendants, confronted with a sizeable loss attributable to the appellant's imprudence, misjudged the Plan's legal rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge made an additional point, referring to his original finding that Cottrill was the person primarily responsible for the Plan's substantial losses and deeming this fact relevant to the issue of attorneys' fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  This is out of the ordinary, for the traditional formulation of the first factor suggests an inquiry into the bad faith or culpability only of the losing party.  Still, on the odd facts of this case, we cannot say that the district court's emphasis on the prevailing party's culpability constitutes an abuse of discretion.  Cf. Armistead, 944 F.2d at 1304 (finding no abuse of discretion in the absence of a showing that consideration of other factors would have led to a different result).  At the very least, Cottrill's conduct is germane as an additional--and significant--circumstance to be considered under the flexible standard that governs ERISA fee applications.  See, e.g., Anthuis, 971 F.2d at 1012.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second factor is a non-starter.  While evidence existed that the defendants had funds available and could have afforded to pay the appellant's fees, this datum has little relevance here.  An inability to afford attorneys' fees may counsel against an award, see Armistead, 944 F.2d at 1305, but the capacity to pay, by itself, does not justify an award, see Thorpe, 80 F.3d at 445;  Tiemeyer v. Community Mut. Ins. Co., 8 F.3d 1094, 1102 (6th Cir.1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1005, 114 S.Ct. 1371, 128 L.Ed.2d 48 (1994);  Quesinberry, 987 F.2d at 1030.   Consequently, the district court did not blunder in finding that the second factor lacked appreciable significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing the uniqueness of the situation, the district court found the third factor--generalized deterrence--to be a mixed bag.  The court reasoned that an award of fees might deter the wrongful withholding of accounts by fiduciaries, but that a denial of fees might deter participants and beneficiaries from acting recklessly in respect to the assets of employee benefit plans.  The appellant does not make any convincing counter-argument.  While we recognize the deterrent value of fee awards against errant fiduciaries and attach considerable weight to such deterrence, we discern no reason on these peculiar facts for rejecting the district court's analysis of deterrence as an element here.  Given the trial court's superior vantage point, its evaluative judgments about such case-specific matters are entitled to substantial respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth factor--common benefit--cuts against the appellant.  His situation is both exotic and fact-dependent;  thus, other participants do not stand to profit from the appellant's success.  This lack of other similarly situated participants militates against a fee award.  See Custer, 12 F.3d at 423.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last but not least, we address the merits of the underlying suit.  We agree with the court below that the case presented a close question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The very fact that an experienced trial judge originally found in the defendants' favor argues for a finding that the defendants had a reasonable basis for contesting Cottrill's entitlement to the funds, even though this court ultimately ruled against them.  Cf. Sierra Club v. Secretary of the Army, 820 F.2d 513, 519 (1st Cir.1987) (acknowledging in an EAJA case that a party's success in the district court is some evidence that its position was justified);  Porter v. Heckler, 780 F.2d 920, 922 (11th Cir.1986) (similar).  The fifth factor, then, is something of a wash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bottom line is that the district court applied the conventional five-factor test in an acceptable manner and added idiosyncratic features to it in a reasonable way.  The court recognized that a successful plaintiff in an ERISA case more often than not should recover attorneys' fees, but concluded for reasons fully articulated in the record that this claim fell on the other side of the border.  If writing on a pristine page, we might have weighed the mix of factors differently--but that is beside the point.  Absent a mistake of law or a clear error in judgment--neither of which is evident here--we must defer to the trial court's first-hand knowledge and to its battlefield determination that the specific facts of this case do not warrant a fee award.  See Florence Nightingale, 41 F.3d at 1485;  Gray, 792 F.2d at 260.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The rulings of which the appellant complains were well within the realm of the trial court's discretion.  The appellant, once victorious, is now vanquished.  He perhaps should have quit while he was ahead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The defendants in this case are SJU, its profit-sharing plan (the Plan), and Steven J. Ursillo (SJU's chief executive officer and the Plan's trustee).  For simplicity's sake, we refer to them collectively as \"the trustee\" or \"the defendants.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The appellant disputes the district court's finding that, prior to year's end, the appellant's money continued to earn interest.  We have two reactions.  First, the finding is unnecessary to the result, for it is the fact that the account remained untouched, coupled with the absence of a meaningful turnover demand at an earlier time, that renders the December 31, 1991 date defensible.  Second, the court relied upon the representations of SJU's counsel (uncontradicted by Cottrill's lawyer) in making this ore tenus finding and invited Cottrill to seek to modify the order if these representations were erroneous.  Cottrill never accepted the invitation.  Therefore, he cannot complain of the finding here.  See Dow v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners, 1 F.3d 56, 61-62 (1st Cir.1993) (holding that a party who eschewed the court's invitation to seek discovery if needed waived any subsequent objection to lack of discovery); Reilly v. United States, 863 F.2d 149, 168 (1st Cir.1988) (upholding denial of discovery request where supposedly aggrieved party did not accept the magistrate's invitation to renew it at a later date);  cf. United States v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 570 n. 9 (1st Cir.1996) (explaining that defendant's failure to file a motion for reconsideration undercut his later objection to district court's suppression order)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We do not place Smith v. CMTA-IAM Pension Trust, 746 F.2d 587 (9th Cir.1984), in this category.  Although Smith quotes liberally from a civil rights case, see id. at 589, the opinion does not suggest the use of a mandatory presumption, but merely applies the five basic factors in light of ERISA's remedial purposes.  See Eddy, 59 F.3d at 207 (reaching the same conclusion)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This finding had been made at trial and, although we reversed the judgment, our decision in no way questioned the finding of culpability.  See Cottrill, 74 F.3d at 21 (chronicling the conduct which informed the lower court's assessment of culpability)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In our prior opinion we wrote that \"there was no possible basis for the [district] court's conclusion that Cottrill was a fiduciary.\"  Cottrill, 74 F.3d at 22.   The appellant seizes upon this remark as proof that the merits were open and shut.  But the appellant wrests this statement from its contextual moorings.  Fairly read, the comment capped the preceding analysis which, examined in context, illustrated the uncertainty of who is a fiduciary under ERISA.  This was a reasonably close case and, just as we have warned that a judicial decision cannot be transmogrified by placing overly great reliance on an awkward locution contained in a trial court's opinion, see Dopp v. Pritzker, 38 F.3d 1239, 1244 n. 5 (1st Cir.1994);  Lenn v. Portland Sch. Comm., 998 F.2d 1083, 1088 n. 4 (1st Cir.1993), so, too, we are wary of a party's attempts to attach portentous significance to an appellate court's use of isolated phraseology</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

(SJU).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  In our first visit to the war zone we determined that Cottrill was not a fiduciary within the contemplation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1001-1461 (1994), and specifically, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A).  See Cottrill v.

First, they are adequately stated in our earlier opinion.  See id. at 21.   Second, the questions that Cottrill now raises do not pertain directly to the merits of his cause, but concern only embellishments to the judgment.  Thus, after pausing to elucidate the standard of review, we proceed immediately to the appellant's asseverational array.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees are available, but not obligatory, in ERISA cases.

An appellate court reviews the grant or denial of prejudgment interest in ERISA cases solely for abuse of discretion.  See Smith v.

This judicial discretion encompasses not only the overarching question--whether to award prejudgment interest at all--but also subsidiary questions that arise after the court decides to make an award, including matters such as the period and rate to be used in calculating interest.  See, e.g., Smith, 50 F.3d at 958.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court awarded prejudgment interest, but, in Cottrill's estimation, the court chose an unrealistic accrual date (thereby truncating the period for which it allowed interest) and then compounded the error by selecting too miserly an interest rate.  We address each of these complaints in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. The Date of Accrual.   Ordinarily, a cause of action under ERISA and prejudgment interest on a plan participant's claim both accrue when a fiduciary denies a participant benefits.  See, e.g., Larsen v.

Setting the accrual date in this manner not only advances the general purposes of prejudgment interest, see West Virginia v.

The district court saw matters differently;  it found that the cause of action accrued on December 31, 1991, when the trustee erroneously declared Cottrill's funds forfeit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's reasoning is persuasive.  The attorney's letter cannot reasonably be construed as a demand for funds.  It was an inquiry for the purpose of providing information necessary to the divorce pavane--no more, no less.  The defendants' response to this letter confirms our assessment.  Neither in language nor in tone does it presume to deny any application for benefits, but, rather, merely indicates the amounts involved and when particular assets would be available for distribution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once past the lawyer's letter, the district court's determination that the defendants did not deprive Cottrill of his benefits until they offset his account on December 31, 1991 (ostensibly to recoup losses that he occasioned, see Cottrill, 74 F.3d at 21) is virtually inevitable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Hence, the court acted well within its discretion in finding that prejudgment interest began to accrue on that date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. The Rate of Interest.   ERISA provides for postjudgment interest to be calculated at the federal rate, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(a) (1994), but it contains no explicit provision for prejudgment interest.  Here, the district court employed the federal statutory rate for that purpose.  The appellant argues that the court should have used the (somewhat more munificent) rate available under Rhode Island law.  See R.I. Gen. Laws &#167; 9-21-10 (1985) (stipulating a flat rate of 12% per annum).  We do not think that the district court exceeded its discretion in choosing the federal rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general rule, federal law governs the scope of remedies available when a claim arises under a federal statute, and this doctrine extends to the rate of prejudgment interest.  See Colon Velez v. Puerto Rico Marine Mgmt., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578606\"><a href=\"/opinion/578606/wilfredo-colon-velez-v-puerto-rico-marine-management-inc-wilfredo-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">933</span></a></span>, 941 (1st Cir.1992).  Of course, if the particular federal statute is silent, courts have discretion to select an appropriate rate, and they may look to outside sources, including state law, for guidance.  See id.   Because ERISA is inscrutable on the subject, a court that elects to award prejudgment interest in an ERISA case has broad discretion in choosing a rate.  See Hansen v. Continental Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566021\"><a href=\"/opinion/566021/martin-hansen-cross-appellee-v-the-continental-insurance-company-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span>, 983-85 (5th Cir.1991).  In such a situation, equitable considerations should guide the exercise of judicial discretion.  See, e.g., Kinek v. Paramount Communications, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"668555\"><a href=\"/opinion/668555/charles-kinek-ernest-moreno-steve-konik-steven-yanecko-pension-benefit/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span>, 514 (2d Cir.1994);  Anthuis, 971 F.2d at 1009.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant insists that the lower court departed from \"clear federal appellate court precedent\" favoring the use of state prejudgment interest rates in ERISA cases.  He is wrong.  Although federal courts sometimes have looked to state rates for guidance, see, e.g., Hansen, 940 F.2d at 983-84, they have done so as a matter not of compulsion, but of discretion.  Indeed, the appellant's argument conveniently overlooks numerous ERISA cases in which federal appellate and district courts have approved use of the federal statutory rate for prejudgment interest.  See, e.g., Mansker v. TMG Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"696226\"><a href=\"/opinion/696226/bernice-v-mansker-individually-and-as-special-administratrix-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1322</span></a></span>, 1331 (8th Cir.1995);  Sweet, 913 F.2d at 270;  Blanton v.

The law confers discretion on the trial judge, not on the court of appeals.  In this instance the judge chose to use the federal statutory rate in computing prejudgment interest.  Utilizing this rate promotes uniformity in ERISA cases.  Furthermore, the federal rate is an objective measure of the value of money over time, and the record makes manifest that, in selecting it, the district judge considered both the rationale of full compensation and ERISA's underlying goals.  We note, too, that the federal rate is especially appropriate in this case because the Plan's funds were initially invested in Treasury bills.  See, e.g., Algie, 891 F.Supp. at 899 (finding the federal rate appropriate when it more closely approximated the likely return on the funds withheld).  Mindful of these realities, we do not think that equity demands the use of a higher rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <p>Counsel Fees</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also challenges the denial of counsel fees.  Congress declared that, in any ERISA claim advanced by a \"participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary, the court in its discretion may allow a reasonable attorney's fee\" to the prevailing party.  29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(g)(1).  Unlike other fee-shifting statutes, however, ERISA does not provide for a virtually automatic award of attorneys' fees to prevailing plaintiffs.  Instead, fee awards under ERISA are wholly discretionary.  See Gray, 792 F.2d at 259.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This discretion is not standardless.  To channel its exercise, this court has cited five basic factors that customarily should be weighed in the balance:  (1) the degree of culpability or bad faith attributable to the losing party;  (2) the depth of the losing party's pocket, i.e., his or her capacity to pay an award;  (3) the extent (if at all) to which such an award would deter other persons acting under similar circumstances;  (4) the benefit (if any) that the successful suit confers on plan participants or beneficiaries generally;  and (5) the relative merit of the parties' positions.  See id. at 257-58.   Other courts of appeals have compiled strikingly similar lists.  See Eddy v. Colonial Life Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"699195\"><a href=\"/opinion/699195/joan-eddy-of-the-estate-of-james-peter-eddy-v-colonial-life-insurance/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span>, 206 n. 10 (D.C.Cir.1995) (collecting cases).  The circuits agree that such compendia are exemplary rather than exclusive.  See id. at 206;  Quesinberry, 987 F.2d at 1029.   An inquiring court may--indeed, should--consider additional criteria that seem apropos in a given case.  See Anthuis, 971 F.2d at 1012.   In a word, the test for granting or denying counsel fees in an ERISA case is \"flexible.\"  Gray, 792 F.2d at 258.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.

We hold that, in an ERISA case, a prevailing plaintiff does not, merely by prevailing, create a presumption that he or she is entitled to a fee-shifting award.  Our holding flows naturally from the importance of preserving flexibility in this area of the law.  Our holding is, moreover, adumbrated by our earlier decision in Gray.   There, we explicitly rejected the creation of a presumption in favor of prevailing defendants.  792 F.2d at 258.   We pointed out that 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132(g)(1) speaks in discretionary terms, and that its legislative history, unlike that of certain civil rights statutes, does not support a presumption via-a-vis counsel fees.  See Gray, 792 F.2d at 258-59.   This rationale suggests to us that a presumption in favor of prevailing plaintiffs also would be overkill;  because the five basic factors have a built-in bias in favor of prevailing plaintiffs, see id.  (recognizing that the second, third, and fourth factors may favor prevailing plaintiffs more so than prevailing defendants), the superimposition of a presumption seems unnecessary as a means of protecting the legitimate interests of plan beneficiaries and participants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Validity of the Order.   Having declined to employ a mandatory presumption, we turn now to the district court's order.  The appellant contends that the court mishandled the five basic factors.  This contention lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In terms of the first factor--culpability--the record contains no indication that the defendants exhibited bad faith;  they consulted with counsel and conducted a year-long investigation before offsetting Cottrill's account.  Thus, even though the Plan was ultimately found liable under the statute, the worst that can be said is that the defendants, confronted with a sizeable loss attributable to the appellant's imprudence, misjudged the Plan's legal rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge made an additional point, referring to his original finding that Cottrill was the person primarily responsible for the Plan's substantial losses and deeming this fact relevant to the issue of attorneys' fees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  This is out of the ordinary, for the traditional formulation of the first factor suggests an inquiry into the bad faith or culpability only of the losing party.  Still, on the odd facts of this case, we cannot say that the district court's emphasis on the prevailing party's culpability constitutes an abuse of discretion.  Cf. Armistead, 944 F.2d at 1304 (finding no abuse of discretion in the absence of a showing that consideration of other factors would have led to a different result).  At the very least, Cottrill's conduct is germane as an additional--and significant--circumstance to be considered under the flexible standard that governs ERISA fee applications.  See, e.g., Anthuis, 971 F.2d at 1012.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second factor is a non-starter.  While evidence existed that the defendants had funds available and could have afforded to pay the appellant's fees, this datum has little relevance here.  An inability to afford attorneys' fees may counsel against an award, see Armistead, 944 F.2d at 1305, but the capacity to pay, by itself, does not justify an award, see Thorpe, 80 F.3d at 445;  Tiemeyer v. Community Mut. Ins. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656586\"><a href=\"/opinion/656586/donna-tiemeyer-thomas-tiemeyer-geoffrey-tiemeyer-by-donna-tiemeyer-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1094</span></a></span>, 1102 (6th Cir.1993), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></span> (1994);  Quesinberry, 987 F.2d at 1030.   Consequently, the district court did not blunder in finding that the second factor lacked appreciable significance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing the uniqueness of the situation, the district court found the third factor--generalized deterrence--to be a mixed bag.  The court reasoned that an award of fees might deter the wrongful withholding of accounts by fiduciaries, but that a denial of fees might deter participants and beneficiaries from acting recklessly in respect to the assets of employee benefit plans.  The appellant does not make any convincing counter-argument.  While we recognize the deterrent value of fee awards against errant fiduciaries and attach considerable weight to such deterrence, we discern no reason on these peculiar facts for rejecting the district court's analysis of deterrence as an element here.  Given the trial court's superior vantage point, its evaluative judgments about such case-specific matters are entitled to substantial respect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth factor--common benefit--cuts against the appellant.  His situation is both exotic and fact-dependent;  thus, other participants do not stand to profit from the appellant's success.  This lack of other similarly situated participants militates against a fee award.  See Custer, 12 F.3d at 423.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last but not least, we address the merits of the underlying suit.  We agree with the court below that the case presented a close question.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  The very fact that an experienced trial judge originally found in the defendants' favor argues for a finding that the defendants had a reasonable basis for contesting Cottrill's entitlement to the funds, even though this court ultimately ruled against them.  Cf. Sierra Club v. Secretary of the Army, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489491\"><a href=\"/opinion/489491/sierra-club-v-secretary-of-the-army-sierra-club-v-secretary-of-the-army/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 519 (1st Cir.1987) (acknowledging in an EAJA case that a party's success in the district court is some evidence that its position was justified);  Porter v. Heckler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"462737\"><a href=\"/opinion/462737/ella-porter-v-margaret-heckler-in-her-capacity-as-secretary-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">780</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></a></span>, 922 (11th Cir.1986) (similar).  The fifth factor, then, is something of a wash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bottom line is that the district court applied the conventional five-factor test in an acceptable manner and added idiosyncratic features to it in a reasonable way.  The court recognized that a successful plaintiff in an ERISA case more often than not should recover attorneys' fees, but concluded for reasons fully articulated in the record that this claim fell on the other side of the border.  If writing on a pristine page, we might have weighed the mix of factors differently--but that is beside the point.  Absent a mistake of law or a clear error in judgment--neither of which is evident here--we must defer to the trial court's first-hand knowledge and to its battlefield determination that the specific facts of this case do not warrant a fee award.  See Florence Nightingale, 41 F.3d at 1485;  Gray, 792 F.2d at 260.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  The rulings of which the appellant complains were well within the realm of the trial court's discretion.  The appellant, once victorious, is now vanquished.

We have two reactions.  First, the finding is unnecessary to the result, for it is the fact that the account remained untouched, coupled with the absence of a meaningful turnover demand at an earlier time, that renders the December 31, 1991 date defensible.  Second, the court relied upon the representations of SJU's counsel (uncontradicted by Cottrill's lawyer) in making this ore tenus finding and invited Cottrill to seek to modify the order if these representations were erroneous.  Cottrill never accepted the invitation.  Therefore, he cannot complain of the finding here.  See Dow v.

Although Smith quotes liberally from a civil rights case, see id. at 589, the opinion does not suggest the use of a mandatory presumption, but merely applies the five basic factors in light of ERISA's remedial purposes.

The appellant seizes upon this remark as proof that the merits were open and shut.  But the appellant wrests this statement from its contextual moorings.  Fairly read, the comment capped the preceding analysis which, examined in context, illustrated the uncertainty of who is a fiduciary under ERISA.  This was a reasonably close case and, just as we have warned that a judicial decision cannot be transmogrified by placing overly great reliance on an awkward locution contained in a trial court's opinion, see Dopp v.
