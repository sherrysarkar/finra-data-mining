  "plain_text": "[NOT FOR PUBLICATION   NOT TO BE CITED AS PRECEDENT]\r\nUnited States Court of Appeals\r\nFor the First Circuit\r\n\nNo. 98-1203\r\n\nJOSE AMILCAR CLAVEL-VASQUEZ,\r\n\nPetitioner,\r\n\n     v.\r\n\nIMMIGRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE,\r\n\nRespondent.\r\n\nPETITION FOR REVIEW OF \r\nAN ORDER OF THE BOARD OF IMMIGRATION APPEALS\r\n\n  Before\r\n\nLipez, Circuit Judge,\r\nCoffin and Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge.\r\n\nAlan M. Tow with whom Linda A. Cristello was on brief for\r\npetitioner.\r\nJoseph F. Ciolino, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\r\nwith whom Frank W. Hunger, Assistant Attorney General, and Carl H.\r\nMcIntyre, Jr., Senior Litigation Counsel, were on brief for\r\nrespondent.\r\n\nOctober 26, 1998\r\n\nPer curiam. Petitioner Clavel-Vasquez seeks reversal of\r\nan order of deportation issued by the Board of Immigration Appeals\r\n(BIA).  We may reverse the BIA's determination that petitioner is\r\ndeportable only if he can demonstrate that the evidence he\r\npresented was \"so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could\r\nfail to find\" that he was eligible for asylum or withholding of\r\ndeportation.  INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 484 (1992); seealso id. at 481 n.1; Civil v. INS, 140 F.3d 52, 54 (lst Cir. 1998);\r\nRavindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (lst Cir. 1992).  Petitioner\r\nhas not met this burden.  The record simply does not present a\r\nsufficiently compelling nexus between petitioner's fear of\r\npersecution and any political opinion.  Indeed, having carefully\r\nreviewed the record and relevant law, we find ourselves in full\r\nagreement with the BIA's decision, which in turn relied upon the\r\nreasons stated by the Immigration Judge.  We see no need to repeat\r\nhere their thoughtful discussions.  See Chen v. INS, 87 F.3d 5, 7-8\r\n(lst Cir. 1996) (\"[I]f a reviewing tribunal decides that the facts\r\nand evaluative judgments prescinding from them have been adequately\r\nconfronted and correctly resolved by a trial judge or hearing\r\nofficer, then the tribunal is free simply to adopt those findings\"\r\nso long as the opinion or order reflects individualized attention\r\nto the case.).\r\nThe petition for review is denied and dismissed.\n",
