Rindler, with whom Rindler Morgar, P.C. and Nadine Nasser\nDonovan, were on brief, for appellees Boston Emergency Services Team\nand New England Medical Center Hospitals, Inc.\n\fJune 12, 2001\n\n\n\n\n     -2-\n\f          Per Curiam. Appellant José O. García appeals a decision\n\ngranting summary judgment in favor of appellees City of Boston\n\n(\"City\"), Boston Emergency Services Team (\"BEST\"), and New England\n\nMedical Center Hospitals, Inc. (\"NEMC\").       We affirm.\n\n          On August 19, 1994, García was arrested by the Boston Police\n\nDepartment (\"BPD\") after he was involved in a domestic disturbance. He\n\nwas charged with violating Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 209A (threats of\n\nviolence under Massachusetts Domestic Violence Law) and Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 265, § 13D (assault and battery upon police officers).1 The BPD\n\ntook him to the station, where he was booked and placed in a cell.\n\nBecause García was arrested on a Friday night, he would not be\n\narraigned until Monday morning.\n\n          That evening, García, in an apparent suicide attempt, made\n\nsome superficial cuts to his wrist with the aluminum top of a juice\n\ncontainer. An ambulance was called, but it was determined that García\n\ndid not want nor need further medical treatment. He was then placed on\n\nthe suicide list and handcuffed to the \"suicide wall,\"2 located in the\n\nbooking area.\n\n\n\n\n1 In addition to the new charges, García had an outstanding default\nwarrant issued against him.\n2 The \"suicide wall\" was a bar in the booking area to which prisoners\nwho were identified as suicide risks were handcuffed in order to more\nclosely monitor them.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          On Saturday evening, still handcuffed to the suicide wall,\n\nGarcía somehow obtained matches and lit himself on fire. He was taken\n\nto Boston City Hospital (\"BCH\") where he received treatment for first\n\nand second degree burns.     While at BCH, a resident psychiatrist\n\nevaluated García, and concluded that he was a suicide risk. Steps were\n\ntaken to facilitate an inpatient admission to an area hospital.\n\nBecause BCH did not have inpatient facilities, BEST3 was contacted in\n\norder to locate an appropriate facility for García.        García was\n\nuninsured, and therefore ineligible for admission into a private\n\nfacility. His only option, then, was a Department of Mental Health\n\n(\"DMH\") center.\n\n          Accordingly, DMH Adjudicator Jim Galvin was contacted about\n\nadmitting García to a facility. Galvin took the position that because\n\nGarcía was under arrest and not yet arraigned, it would violate a DMH\n\npolicy to admit him.   In order to obtain admission, García had to\n\neither be arraigned or have the charges against him dropped. There was\n\nno judge available to arraign García. In addition, the BPD refused to\n\ndrop the charges against García because of their severity. After an\n\nunsuccessful attempt by the BPD to persuade BCH to allow García to\n\n\n\n\n3 BEST is a program of the NEMC's Department of Psychiatry. Its stated\nfunction is to \"provide timely, quantitative assessment and disposition\nfor individuals in the Boston Area who require emergency psychiatric\nservices.\"\n\n                                 -4-\n\fstay, under police guard, until his Monday morning arraignment, García\n\nwas returned to the station and handcuffed to the suicide wall.\n\n          Upon his return to the station, García again obtained some\n\nmatches and lit his shirt on fire. The fire was quickly extinguished\n\nwithout injury.    Shortly thereafter, Officer William Cullinane\n\ndistributed lunches to the prisoners locked to the suicide wall.\n\nSomehow, García was able to remove Officer Cullinane's gun from his\n\nholster and began firing the weapon. Officer Cullinane and another\n\nprisoner on the suicide wall were shot by García before Officer Stephen\n\nFahey shot García in the arm, causing García to drop Officer\n\nCullinane's weapon.\n\n          García subsequently brought this suit against the City,\n\nalleging violations of his constitutional rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\nand the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, § 11I.\n\nHe later amended his complaint to include claims of negligence and\n\nbreach of contract against BEST and the NEMC. The City, and BEST and\n\nNEMC collectively, moved for summary judgment, which the district court\n\ngranted as to all claims. García v. City of Boston, 115 F. Supp. 2d 72\n\n(D. Mass. 2000) (Mem. and Order).\n\n          Ruling on the City's motion, the district court held the\n\nfollowing. As to García's excessive and unreasonable force claim,\n\nGarcía failed to fulfill any of the requirements of the four-part test\n\nthat the district court applied. See Johnson v. Glick, 481 F.2d 1028,\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f1033 (2d Cir. 1973), rejected on other grounds, Graham v. Connor, 490\n\nU.S. 386 (1989). Specifically, the district court held that there was\n\n\"a clear need for the use of force\" when Officer Fahey shot García in\n\nthe arm, namely because García was firing a gun and had already shot an\n\nofficer and a fellow prisoner. García, 115 F. Supp. 2d at 81. In\n\naddition, that force was proportionate to the need, and, considering\n\nthe circumstances, García's injury was relatively minor. Id. Finally,\n\n\"there [wa]s absolutely no evidence\" of bad faith on the part of\n\nOfficer Fahey or that his actions were taken \"maliciously or\n\nsadistically for the very purpose of inflicting harm.\"         Id.\n\n          Even construing the material facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to García, Campbell v. Wash. County Technical Coll., 219 F.3d\n\n3, 5 (1st Cir. 2000), we can perceive no construction of the evidence\n\nthat could sustain this claim. Without commenting on the appropriate\n\ntest to be employed when evaluating an excessive and unreasonable force\n\nclaim in these circumstances,4 we affirm the holding of the district\n\ncourt on this issue.\n\n          As to García's denial of medical and psychological care\n\ncharge, the district court first identified a \"duty to attend to a\n\n\n\n4 In declining to comment, we note only that neither the Supreme Court\nnor this circuit have established a test for this factual scenario.\nCompare Johnson, 481 F.2d at 1033 (test used above), with Bell v.\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535-37 (1979) (evaluating conditions of pre-\ntrial detention), and Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1038 (1st Cir.\n1996) (high speed police pursuits).\n\n                                 -6-\n\fprisoner's 'serious medical needs.'\" García, 115 F. Supp. 2d at 82\n\n(quoting Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976)). The court found\n\nthat García's psychological problems constituted serious medical needs.\n\nId. García, however, did not demonstrate that his failure to receive\n\ninpatient treatment was the result of \"an unconstitutional custom or\n\npolicy.\" Id. at 83. The BPD did have a policy for handling suicidal\n\nprisoners like García. It was García's unusual situation, of being\n\nuninsured and pre-arraignment, coupled with the DMH's policy of\n\nrefusing to admit psychiatric patients who had not been arraigned, that\n\nresulted in García not being placed in a facility.         \"Deliberate\n\nindifference\" to García's medical needs played no role in this\n\nincident. Id. at 82-83 (quoting Estelle, 429 U.S. at 104). Thus,\n\nGarcía's § 1983 claim necessarily failed.         Id. at 84.\n\n             We agree with the district court's reasoning and conclusion\n\nand affirm on that basis. We also affirm the district court's holding\n\nthat García's failure to establish a § 1983 claim essentially equates\n\nto a failure to establish a claim under the Massachusetts Civil Rights\n\nAct.   Id.\n\n             The district court also held that García's negligence and\n\ncontract claims against BEST and NEMC could not be sustained. Id. at\n\n77. García alleged two theories under negligence: medical malpractice\n\nand administrative negligence. The district court found that a medical\n\nmalpractice claim was not viable, because García could not demonstrate,\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fas required by Massachusetts medical malpractice law, that a physician-\n\npatient relationship between García and either BEST or NEMC existed.\n\nId. at 78. We agree. The administrative negligence claim is even\n\nweaker, and we affirm the district court's conclusion that neither BEST\n\nnor NEMC was negligent.     Id. at 79.\n\n          Citing its prior holding that the DMH policy was the cause\n\nof García not being admitted to an inpatient facility, the district\n\ncourt concluded that BEST and NEMC fulfilled the terms of their\n\nservices contract. As such, García's contract claim failed. Id. at\n\n80.   Again, we agree with the district court in this regard.\n\n          Having upheld the holdings of the district court in all\n\nrespects, we affirm the granting of summary judgment and dismissal of\n\nthis complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",
