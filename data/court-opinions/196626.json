As  the  district  court\r\n\nobserved,  Congress enacted  the current  version of  section\r\n\n623(f) in  response to the Supreme Court's decision in Public\r                                                                         \r\n\nEmployees  Retirement Sys.  v.

This  Senate  report  said\r\n\nexplicitly that Congress  intended to incorporate only  those\r\n\nportions  of  the  regulation  consistent  with  the  amended\r\n\nstatute.  Id.\r                         \r\n\n     The Commonwealth argues that because the ADEA here would\r\n\npreempt a  state statute, we  must apply a  \"clear statement\"\r\n\nrule of interpretation,  e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft,  501 U.S.\r                                                              \r\n\n452  (1991), and  resolve in  favor of  the Commonwealth  any\r\n\ndoubts  about  whether Congress  intended  to  incorporate 29\r\n\nC.F.R.   1625.10(f)(1)(iii)(a).  The EEOC  plausibly responds\r\n\nthat  the clear  statement  rule  applies  only  in  deciding\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nwhether  the  state  is  governed  by the  ADEA  and  not  to\r\n\nquestions  concerning  the  substantive  reach of  the  ADEA,\r\n\nquestions  whose answer affects  public and private employers\r\n\nalike.   Although  this precise  question may  not have  been\r\n\ndecided,  we have  been  very  hesitant  in  closely  related\r\n\ncontexts  to extend the clear  statement rule beyond its core\r\n\napplication.   See Gately v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 2\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1221, 1230 (1st Cir.  1993); see EEOC v. Commonwealth of\r                                                                         \r\n\nMassachusetts, 987 F.2d 64, 68-70 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                         \r\n\n     In all events, the meaning of the provision in this case\r\n\nis clear enough once the  technical jargon is unraveled.  The\r              \r\n\nstatute   adopts  an   equal  cost/equal  benefit   test  for\r\n\ndifferentiations \"as permissible\" under the cited regulation,\r\n\nand  no one claims that the  Commonwealth's flat bar conforms\r\n\nto any  equal  cost/equal  benefit test.    Thus,  whether  a\r                  \r\n\nparticular  equal cost/equal  benefit  differential would  be\r\n\n\"permissible\" under  the regulation does not even arise.  The\r\n\nsubject  matter  is complex  but complexity  is not  the same\r\n\nthing as ambiguity.      Affirmed.\r                                             \r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n",

This  Senate  report  said\r\n\nexplicitly that Congress  intended to incorporate only  those\r\n\nportions  of  the  regulation  consistent  with  the  amended\r\n\nstatute.  Id.\r                         \r\n\n     The Commonwealth argues that because the ADEA here would\r\n\npreempt a  state statute, we  must apply a  \"clear statement\"\r\n\nrule of interpretation,  e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112632\"><a href=\"/opinion/112632/gregory-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r                                                              \r\n\n<span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">  (1991), and  resolve in  favor of  the Commonwealth  any\r\n\ndoubts  about  whether Congress  intended  to  incorporate 29\r\n\nC.F.R.   1625.10(f)(1)(iii)(a).  The EEOC  plausibly responds\r\n\nthat  the clear  statement  rule  applies  only  in  deciding\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\nwhether  the  state  is  governed  by the  ADEA  and  not  to\r\n\nquestions  concerning  the  substantive  reach of  the  ADEA,\r\n\nquestions  whose answer affects  public and private employers\r\n\nalike.   Although  this precise  question may  not have  been\r\n\ndecided,  we have  been  very  hesitant  in  closely  related\r\n\ncontexts  to extend the clear  statement rule beyond its core\r\n\napplication.

The\r              \r\n\nstatute   adopts  an   equal  cost/equal  benefit   test  for\r\n\ndifferentiations \"as permissible\" under the cited regulation,\r\n\nand  no one claims that the  Commonwealth's flat bar conforms\r\n\nto any  equal  cost/equal  benefit test.    Thus,  whether  a\r                  \r\n\nparticular  equal cost/equal  benefit  differential would  be\r\n\n\"permissible\" under  the regulation does not even arise.  The\r\n\nsubject  matter  is complex  but complexity  is not  the same\r\n\nthing as ambiguity.
