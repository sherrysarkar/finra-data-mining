Raymond L. Acosta, Senior U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                        Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n           Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nCharles S. Hey-Maestre, with whom Adalina deJesus-Morales was\r\non brief for Manuel A. Iglesias.\r\nRoberto O. Maldonado-Nieves, was on brief for Mutual Life\r\nInsurance Company of New York.\r\n\nSeptember 17, 1998\r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Manuel A. Iglesias\r\nappeals from the district court's grant of summary judgment on his\r\ndiscrimination and contract claims against his former employer,\r\nMutual Life Insurance Company of New York (\"MONY\").  MONY appeals\r\nfrom the court's dismissal of its counterclaim for restitution of\r\nmoney that Iglesias obtained by submitting admittedly overstated\r\nexpense reports.  We affirm the judgment for MONY against Iglesias.\r\nWe vacate the order dismissing MONY's counterclaim and remand the\r\ncounterclaim with directions to dismiss the counterclaim without\r\nprejudice for want of jurisdiction.\r\nI.  Iglesias's Claims.\r\nWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo, taking the\r\nfacts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  See One\r\nNat'l Bank v. Antonellis, 80 F.3d 606, 608 (1st Cir. 1996).  After\r\nconsidering the record, briefs, and oral arguments, we affirm the\r\ndismissal of Iglesias's discrimination and contract claims\r\nsubstantially for the reasons stated in the district court's\r\nmemoranda and orders.  We add only the following short discussion.\r\nRegarding Iglesias's discrimination claims, Iglesias\r\nreceived clear and unequivocal notice that he was terminated as\r\nMONY's San Jose Agency Manager on February 9, 1989, at the latest. \r\nOn that date, MONY sent him a letter informing him that he would no\r\nlonger be authorized to act as Agency Manager.  In the context of\r\nthe parties' prior discussions regarding Iglesias's retirement, the\r\nFebruary 1989 letter put Iglesias on notice that he had been\r\nfired.  Iglesias did not file administrative charges with the\r\nAnti-Discrimination Division of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor\r\nuntil August 28, 1990, and his initial complaint in federal court\r\nwas not filed until April 17, 1991.  Iglesias's action for\r\ndiscrimination was, therefore, barred by the applicable statutes of\r\nlimitations.  See 42 U.S.C.  2000e-5(e) (establishing a 300-day\r\nlimitation period for actions under Title VII that were first\r\npresented to an administrative agency); 29 U.S.C.  626(d)(2)\r\n(setting a 300-day limitation period for actions under the ADEA\r\nthat were first brought before a state authority); Olmo v. Young &amp;\r\nRubicam, 110 D.P.R. 740, 745 (P.R. 1981) (applying a one year\r\nlimitation period to claims brought under Law 100).  The Puerto\r\nRico Supreme Court's decision in Vlez Rodrguez v. Pueblo Int'l,\r\nInc., 94 JTS 37 (P.R. March 18, 1994) does not apply to Iglesias's\r\nclaims for the reasons stated in the district court's memorandum.\r\nRegarding Iglesias's contract claims, MONY's employment\r\ncontract with Iglesias did not limit MONY's ability to withdraw\r\nproducts from the Puerto Rico market.  Iglesias argues that the\r\nprovision in the contract authorizing him to \"solicit applications\r\nfor insurance in MONY of the types of insurance which MONY is\r\nissuing\" created a vested right that prevented MONY from ever\r\naltering its policy offerings in Puerto Rico.  We recognize that\r\n\"when the facts support plausible but conflicting inferences on a\r\npivotal issue in the case, the judge may not choose between those\r\ninferences at the summary judgment stage.\"  Coyne v. Taber Partners\r\nI, 53 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir. 1995).  We need not indulge a\r\nnonmoving party's inferences, however, if they do not \"flow\r\nrationally from the underlying facts.\"  Rubinovitz v. Rogato, 60\r\nF.3d 906, 911 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nNo reasonable jury could agree with Iglesias's reading of\r\nhis contract.  The plain language of the provision purports only to\r\nauthorize Iglesias to sell MONY's product line, it does not\r\nguarantee stability of that line.  MONY is a national company that\r\ndeals with many agents in diverse geographic areas.  To interpret\r\nthis contract provision so as to grant each of those agents the\r\npower to control which products MONY offers within that particular\r\nagent's jurisdiction would give Iglesias and other agents the power\r\nto veto policy decisions made by MONY's upper management at the\r\ncompany's national headquarters.  This would flip the employment\r\nrelationship between MONY and its agents on its head.  Further,\r\neach of Iglesias's contracts contained clauses in which MONY\r\nreserved the right to change the contract.  The district court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment was entirely appropriate.\r\nII.  MONY's Counterclaim.\r\nMONY reimbursed Iglesias for expenses that he incurred as\r\na result of his professional activities.  To supplement his income,\r\nIglesias admits that he \"padded\" his expense reimbursement requests\r\nfrom 1981 to 1988.  MONY first learned of Iglesias's practice of\r\noverstating his expenses in 1987.  At that time, MONY took no legal\r\naction against Iglesias.  Instead, after notifying him that his\r\nconduct conflicted with company policy, MONY requested that he\r\nsubmit accurate reports in the future.  Subsequently, Iglesias\r\nbrought the present action against MONY for discrimination and\r\nbreach of contract.  On November 7, 1991, in the course of a\r\ndeposition, Iglesias admitted that he had continued submitting\r\nexaggerated expense reports even after MONY's 1987 warning.\r\nMONY tried to use the information obtained at the 1991\r\ndeposition in three ways.  First, MONY questioned Iglesias about\r\nhis expense reports during trial in an effort to impeach his\r\ncredibility.  Second, MONY attempted to raise the falsified expense\r\nrequests as an affirmative defense to Iglesias's discrimination\r\nclaims, arguing that they provided MONY with a valid non-\r\ndiscriminatory reason to terminate Iglesias.  The court did not\r\nallow MONY to pursue this strategy because MONY learned of these\r\nimproprieties only after it had terminated Iglesias.\r\nThird, and more importantly for our purposes, MONY sought\r\nleave to amend its answer to add a counterclaim for restitution. \r\nOn March 17, 1992, the magistrate judge granted MONY's request. \r\nFor four years, the parties conducted discovery on the\r\ncounterclaim.  On August 6, 1996, Iglesias moved for dismissal of\r\nMONY's counterclaim arguing, inter alia, that it was barred by\r\nlaches.  On August 14, 1996, the district court dismissed the\r\ncounterclaim as untimely.  MONY now appeals from that dismissal.\r\nAlthough neither of the parties has raised the issue, we\r\nhave an obligation to inquire into our subject matter jurisdiction\r\nover MONY's counterclaim.  See Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U.S.\r\n583, 588 (1939) (holding that although district court's\r\njurisdiction had not been challenged, Court had duty to raise\r\nquestion of whether jurisdictional amount was involved).  See alsoWhite v. Gittens, 121 F.3d 803, 806 (1st Cir. 1997).  Federal\r\ncourts are courts of limited jurisdiction; a court may not address\r\nthe merits until \"after . . . the court has assumed jurisdiction\r\nover the controversy.\"  Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 681 (1946);\r\nsee also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 118 S. Ct.\r\n1003, 1012 (1998) (stating that deciding the merits before\r\nconfirming jurisdiction \"carries the courts beyond the bounds of\r\nauthorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental principles\r\nof separation of powers\").  Since MONY's counterclaim sounds in\r\nstate law, a federal court may not hear it unless it falls within\r\nthe ambit of supplemental jurisdiction or is supported by an\r\nindependent jurisdictional basis.  See Toste Farm Corp. v. Hadbury,\r\nInc., 70 F.3d 640, 646 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that a federal court\r\nhas jurisdiction over a counterclaim only if it resides within the\r\ncourt's supplemental jurisdiction or is supported by an independent\r\njurisdictional basis).\r\nThe parties appear to have assumed that MONY's\r\ncounterclaim was within the court's supplemental jurisdiction. \r\nWhen considering supplemental jurisdiction, the nature of the\r\ncounterclaim is crucial.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13\r\ndescribes two types of counterclaims: compulsory and permissive. \r\nA compulsory counterclaim is one that \"arises out of the\r\ntransaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the\r\nopposing party's claim.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a).  All counterclaims\r\nthat are not compulsory are permissive.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(b). \r\nOnly compulsory counterclaims can rely upon supplemental\r\njurisdiction; permissive counterclaims require their own\r\njurisdictional basis.\r\nThe supplemental jurisdiction statute provides: \"[I]n any\r\ncivil action of which the district courts have original\r\njurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental\r\njurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in\r\nthe action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of\r\nthe same case or controversy under Article III of the United States\r\nConstitution.\"  28 U.S.C.  1367(a).  Section 1367 incorporates the\r\ncommon law doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction. \r\nSee Penobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, 112 F.3d 538, 563 (1st\r\nCir.), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 297 (1997).  Federal courts have\r\nancillary jurisdiction over compulsory counterclaims. \r\nSee McCaffrey v. Rex Motor Transp., Inc., 672 F.2d 246, 248 (1st\r\nCir. 1982); 6 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R, Miller &amp; Mary Kay\r\nKane, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure  1414, at 99 (2d ed. 1990). \r\nPermissive counterclaims, however, do not fall within ancillary\r\njurisdiction and therefore may not be heard in federal court unless\r\nsupported by an independent basis of jurisdiction.  See McCaffrey,\r\n672 F.2d at 248; Wright, et al.,  1422, at 169-70.\r\nThere are at least four tests to determine whether a\r\ncounterclaim is compulsory or permissive:\r\n1) Are the issues of fact and law raised by\r\nthe claim and counterclaim largely the same?\r\n\n2) Would res judicata bar a subsequent suit on\r\ndefendant's claim absent the compulsory\r\ncounterclaim rule?\r\n\n3) Will substantially the same evidence\r\nsupport or refute plaintiff's claim as well as\r\ndefendant's counterclaim?\r\n\n4) Is there any logical relation between the\r\nclaim and the counterclaim?\r\nMcCaffrey, 672 F.2d at 248 (quoting 6 Wright et al., supra,  1410,\r\nat 42 [currently 52-57])(internal quotation marks omitted).  Of\r\nthese tests, only the fourth   the \"logical relation\" test   could\r\npossibly encompass MONY's counterclaim.  In McCaffrey, we adopted\r\nthe Fifth Circuit's treatment of the logical relation test.  Under\r\nthis approach, a claim qualifies as compulsory only if:\r\nit arises out of the same aggregate of\r\noperative facts as the original claim in two\r\nsenses: (1) that the same aggregate of\r\noperative facts serves as the basis of both\r\nclaims; or (2) that the aggregate core of\r\nfacts upon which the original claim rests\r\nactivates additional legal rights in a party\r\ndefendant that would otherwise remain dormant.\r\nMcCaffrey, 672 F.2d at 249 (quoting Revere Copper &amp; Brass, Inc. v.\r\nAetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 426 F.2d 709, 715 (5th Cir. 1970)).\r\nApplying this standard, MONY's counterclaim is\r\npermissive.  First, the aggregate of operative facts giving rise to\r\nIglesias's claims is entirely different from the facts supporting\r\nMONY's counterclaim.  Iglesias alleges that MONY removed its\r\ndisability insurance product from the Puerto Rico market in 1981\r\nfor discriminatory reasons.  That change in policy, he claims, led\r\nto his eventual termination, which therefore was also\r\ndiscriminatory.  The evidence relevant to these claims includes the\r\nterms of Iglesias's employment contract and documentary,\r\ntestimonial or other evidence concerning MONY's actions in Puerto\r\nRico.  By contrast, MONY's counterclaim is for restitution of\r\nmonies that Iglesias wrongfully obtained from the company over the\r\nperiod from 1981 to 1988.  The facts supporting the restitution\r\nclaim include Iglesias's records and expense vouchers for travel\r\nand meals, his admissions during deposition, and documentary,\r\ntestimonial or other evidence regarding MONY's reimbursement\r\npolicies.  Notwithstanding both claims arose during the same time\r\nperiod, they therefore rest on different sets of supporting facts.\r\nSecond, MONY's ability to recover restitution does not\r\ndepend on the success or failure of Iglesias's claims.  Iglesias\r\nhas admitted that he overbilled his expenses to enhance his\r\ncompensation.  Although MONY discovered Iglesias's false\r\nreimbursement requests for 1988 in a deposition that was part of\r\nthe present action, Iglesias's claims did not \"activate\" otherwise\r\ndormant claims.  MONY could have sought reimbursement for its\r\npayments based on Iglesias's false expense reports prior to 1988 at\r\nany point.  Even MONY's claim relating to 1988 expenses is not tied\r\nto the merits of the discrimination and contract claims.  In other\r\nwords, MONY's counterclaim bears no logical relation to the claims\r\nin the main action.\r\nWe conclude that MONY's counterclaim is permissive rather\r\nthan compulsory, and is not supported by federal supplemental\r\njurisdiction.  We look, therefore, to whether it rests on an\r\nindependent federal jurisdictional basis.\r\nThe only possible jurisdictional basis would be diversity\r\nof citizenship.  While Iglesias and MONY are citizens of different\r\nstates, MONY did not allege that its claim exceeded any specified\r\nsum, nor is its amount ascertainable from the record.  See 28\r\nU.S.C.  1332(a) (1993) (limiting diversity jurisdiction to claims\r\nthat exceed a certain amount-in-controversy).  At the time that\r\nMONY asserted its counterclaim, the amount-in-controversy required\r\nwas in excess of $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.  The\r\nburden of alleging jurisdiction is on the party asserting the\r\nclaim.  See Viquiera v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1998)\r\n(stating that \"the proponent . . . must carry the burden of\r\ndemonstrating the existence of federal jurisdiction\").\r\nAlthough \"the sum claimed by the [proponent] controls if\r\nthe claim is apparently made in good faith,\" Saint Paul Mercury\r\nIndem. Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 288 (1938) (footnote\r\nomitted), MONY, as noted, has failed to allege that its\r\ncounterclaim exceeds the required amount-in-controversy nor is\r\nthere evidence in the record from which its value can reliably be\r\ndetermined as exceeding that amount.  MONY stated merely that it\r\nwas:\r\nin the process of reviewing each and everyone\r\n[sic] of the expense reports submitted by Mr.\r\nIglesias to determine what was the scope of\r\nthis practice by Mr. Iglesias and the\r\napproximate amount of funds wrongfully taken\r\nby Mr. Iglesias from Mutual through the scheme\r\nof false expense reports acknowledged by the\r\nplaintiff.\r\nLater, MONY submitted a more detailed accounting of\r\nspecific instances in which Iglesias alleged excessive or false\r\nmileage, but did not state the value of the wrongful claims.  MONY\r\nnoted that Iglesias had charged $48,500.87 in meal expenses between\r\n1981 and 1988, but it did not indicate what portion of these claims\r\nwas false or overstated.\r\nIn these circumstances   lacking MONY's allegation that\r\nthe counterclaim meets the jurisdictional amount, and lacking facts\r\nof record indicative that this is so   we must conclude that the\r\ndistrict court was without jurisdiction to proceed.  We, therefore,\r\nremand the counterclaim with directions that it be dismissed for\r\nwant of jurisdiction.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3)(\"Whenever it\r\nappears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court\r\nlacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss\r\nthe action.\").  See also United Food &amp; Com. Workers Union v.\r\nCentermark Properties Meridien Square, Inc., 30 F.3d 298, 306 (2d\r\nCir. 1994) (addressing for first time on appeal whether district\r\ncourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction and remanding for\r\ndetermination of whether amount in controversy requirement had been\r\nmet). \r\nWe recognize that Iglesias never pointed out below the\r\nabsence of a proper amount-in-controversy allegation, nor was the\r\nsubject raised by anyone.  Had it been raised, MONY might have been\r\nable to remedy the deficiency by amendment if it believed in good\r\nfaith that its counterclaim exceeded the jurisdictional minimum. \r\nIn these circumstances, the dismissal we now order shall be without\r\nprejudice to MONY's right, if it can do so in good faith, to amend\r\nthe counterclaim within such time as the district court allows so\r\nas to allege a supportably proper jurisdictional amount.  If MONY\r\ncan do so, the district court may lift the jurisdictional bar.  Cf.United Food, 30 F.3d at 306.  If that occurs, the court will be\r\nfaced with whether to reinstate its previous dismissal with\r\nprejudice for untimeliness.  We comment briefly.\r\nBecause jurisdiction over the counterclaim has not been \r\nestablished, we are without authority to rule whether the district\r\ncourt's dismissal for untimeliness was proper.  Cf. Steel Co., 118\r\nS. Ct. at 1012.  The issue was, however, presented in this appeal\r\nand we believe it would be helpful if we were to state our initial\r\nimpressions, recognizing their present non-binding character.  MONY\r\nbrought its counterclaim only four months after Iglesias's November\r\n7, 1991 deposition revealing for the first time that he had\r\ncontinued to falsify his expenses even after similar improprieties\r\nwere noted in 1987.  In all the circumstances, it is not readily\r\napparent why MONY should be thought tardy in bringing the\r\ncounterclaim when it did.  \r\nIglesias argues that the counterclaim is barred by\r\nlaches.  The equitable doctrine of laches allows a court to dismiss\r\na claim \"where a party's delay in bringing suit was (1)\r\nunreasonable, and (2) resulted in prejudice to the opposing party.\" \r\nK-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 911 (1st Cir.\r\n1989).   Even if we were to find unreasonable delay within the\r\nperiod between 1987, when MONY first learned that Iglesias had been\r\npadding expenses, and 1992, when, after having warned Iglesias\r\nearlier, MONY asserted its counterclaim based on the subsequent\r\ndefalcations, we fail to see how any of that delay prejudiced\r\nIglesias.  Indeed, such prejudice as there was appears to have\r\nworked the other way.  The magistrate judge had granted permission\r\nto MONY to assert its counterclaim, and the parties thereafter\r\nconducted four years of discovery.  MONY sifted through receipts\r\nfor meals and business trips in an effort to reveal false claims. \r\nThe court's dismissal after four years of discovery had been\r\nallowed seems to work a hardship on MONY.  Given these equities, we\r\nwould have serious questions as to the strength of Iglesias's\r\nlaches argument.  \r\nThe judgment for MONY against Iglesias is affirmed.  The\r\norder dismissing the counterclaim for untimeliness is vacated and\r\nthe counterclaim remanded with directions to dismiss the\r\ncounterclaim without prejudice for want of jurisdiction.  \r\n",

We recognize that \"when the facts support plausible but conflicting inferences on a pivotal issue in the case, the judge may not choose between those inferences at the summary judgment stage.\"  Coyne v. Taber Partners I, 53 F.3d 454, 460 (1st Cir.1995).  We need not indulge a nonmoving party's inferences, however, if they do not \"flow rationally from the underlying facts.\"  Rubinovitz v. Rogato, 60 F.3d 906, 911 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">No reasonable jury could agree with Iglesias's reading of his contract.  The plain language of the provision purports only to authorize Iglesias to sell MONY's product line, it does not guarantee stability of that line.  MONY is a national company that deals with many agents in diverse geographic areas.  To interpret this contract provision so as to grant each of those agents the power to control which products MONY offers within that particular agent's jurisdiction would give Iglesias and other agents the power to veto policy decisions made by MONY's upper management at the company's national headquarters.  This would flip the employment relationship between MONY and its agents on its head.  Further, each of Iglesias's contracts contained clauses in which MONY reserved the right to change the contract.  The district court's grant of summary judgment was entirely appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>II. MONY's Counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MONY reimbursed Iglesias for expenses that he incurred as a result of his professional activities.  To supplement his income, Iglesias admits that he \"padded\" his expense reimbursement requests from 1981 to 1988.  MONY first learned of Iglesias's practice of overstating his expenses in 1987.  At that time, MONY took no legal action against Iglesias.  Instead, after notifying him that his conduct conflicted with company policy, MONY requested that he submit accurate reports in the future.  Subsequently, Iglesias brought the present action against MONY for discrimination and breach of contract.  On November 7, 1991, in the course of a deposition, Iglesias admitted that he had continued submitting exaggerated expense reports even after MONY's 1987 warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MONY tried to use the information obtained at the 1991 deposition in three ways.  First, MONY questioned Iglesias about his expense reports during trial in an effort to impeach his credibility.  Second, MONY attempted to raise the falsified expense requests as an affirmative defense to Iglesias's discrimination claims, arguing that they provided MONY with a valid non-discriminatory reason to terminate Iglesias.  The court did not allow MONY to pursue this strategy because MONY learned of these improprieties only after it had terminated Iglesias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and more importantly for our purposes, MONY sought leave to amend its answer to add a counterclaim for restitution.  On March 17, 1992, the magistrate judge granted MONY's request.  For four years, the parties conducted discovery on the counterclaim.  On August 6, 1996, Iglesias moved for dismissal of MONY's counterclaim arguing, inter alia, that it was barred by laches.  On August 14, 1996, the district court dismissed the counterclaim as untimely.  MONY now appeals from that dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although neither of the parties has raised the issue, we have an obligation to inquire into our subject matter jurisdiction over MONY's counterclaim.  See Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U.S. 583, 588, 59 S.Ct. 744, 83 L.Ed. 1001 (1939) (holding that although district court's jurisdiction had not been challenged, Court had duty to raise question of whether jurisdictional amount was involved).  See also White v. Gittens, 121 F.3d 803, 806 (1st Cir.1997).  Federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction;  a court may not address the merits until \"after ... the court has assumed jurisdiction over the controversy.\"  Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 681, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946);  see also Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Environment, --- U.S. ----, ----, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 1012, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998) (stating that deciding the merits before confirming jurisdiction \"carries the courts beyond the bounds of authorized judicial action and thus offends fundamental principles of separation of powers\").  Since MONY's counterclaim sounds in state law, a federal court may not hear it unless it falls within the ambit of supplemental jurisdiction or is supported by an independent jurisdictional basis.  See Toste Farm Corp. v. Hadbury, Inc., 70 F.3d 640, 646 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that a federal court has jurisdiction over a counterclaim only if it resides within the court's supplemental jurisdiction or is supported by an independent jurisdictional basis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties appear to have assumed that MONY's counterclaim was within the court's supplemental jurisdiction.  When considering supplemental jurisdiction, the nature of the counterclaim is crucial.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13 describes two types of counterclaims:  compulsory and permissive.  A compulsory counterclaim is one that \"arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a).  All counterclaims that are not compulsory are permissive.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(b).  Only compulsory counterclaims can rely upon supplemental jurisdiction;  permissive counterclaims require their own jurisdictional basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supplemental jurisdiction statute provides:  \"[I]n any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(a).  Section 1367 incorporates the common law doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction.  See Penobscot Indian Nation v. Key Bank, 112 F.3d 538, 563 (1st Cir.1997), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 297, 139 L.Ed.2d 229 (1997).  Federal courts have ancillary jurisdiction over compulsory counterclaims.  See McCaffrey v. Rex Motor Transp., Inc., 672 F.2d 246, 248 (1st Cir.1982);  6 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R, Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure &#167; 1414, at 99 (2d ed.1990).  Permissive counterclaims, however, do not fall within ancillary jurisdiction and therefore may not be heard in federal court unless supported by an independent basis of jurisdiction.  See McCaffrey, 672 F.2d at 248;  Wright, Miller &amp; Kane, &#167; 1422, at 169-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are at least four tests to determine whether a counterclaim is compulsory or permissive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>1) Are the issues of fact and law raised by the claim and counterclaim largely the same?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p>2) Would res judicata bar a subsequent suit on defendant's claim absent the compulsory counterclaim rule?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>3) Will substantially the same evidence support or refute plaintiff's claim as well as defendant's counterclaim?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>4) Is there any logical relation between the claim and the counterclaim?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCaffrey, 672 F.2d at 248 (quoting 6 Wright , Miller &amp; Kane, supra, &#167; 1410, at 42 [currently 52-57] )(internal quotation marks omitted).  Of these tests, only the fourth--the \"logical relation\" test--could possibly encompass MONY's counterclaim.  In McCaffrey, we adopted the Fifth Circuit's treatment of the logical relation test.  Under this approach, a claim qualifies as compulsory only if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>it arises out of the same aggregate of operative facts as the original claim in two senses:  (1) that the same aggregate of operative facts serves as the basis of both claims;  or (2) that the aggregate core of facts upon which the original claim rests activates additional legal rights in a party defendant that would otherwise remain dormant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCaffrey, 672 F.2d at 249 (quoting Revere Copper &amp; Brass, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 426 F.2d 709, 715 (5th Cir.1970)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying this standard, MONY's counterclaim is permissive.  First, the aggregate of operative facts giving rise to Iglesias's claims is entirely different from the facts supporting MONY's counterclaim.  Iglesias alleges that MONY removed its disability insurance product from the Puerto Rico market in 1981 for discriminatory reasons.  That change in policy, he claims, led to his eventual termination, which therefore was also discriminatory.  The evidence relevant to these claims includes the terms of Iglesias's employment contract and documentary, testimonial or other evidence concerning MONY's actions in Puerto Rico.  By contrast, MONY's counterclaim is for restitution of monies that Iglesias wrongfully obtained from the company over the period from 1981 to 1988.  The facts supporting the restitution claim include Iglesias's records and expense vouchers for travel and meals, his admissions during deposition, and documentary, testimonial or other evidence regarding MONY's reimbursement policies.  Notwithstanding both claims arose during the same time period, they therefore rest on different sets of supporting facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, MONY's ability to recover restitution does not depend on the success or failure of Iglesias's claims.  Iglesias has admitted that he overbilled his expenses to enhance his compensation.  Although MONY discovered Iglesias's false reimbursement requests for 1988 in a deposition that was part of the present action, Iglesias's claims did not \"activate\" otherwise dormant claims.  MONY could have sought reimbursement for its payments based on Iglesias's false expense reports prior to 1988 at any point.  Even MONY's claim relating to 1988 expenses is not tied to the merits of the discrimination and contract claims.  In other words, MONY's counterclaim bears no logical relation to the claims in the main action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that MONY's counterclaim is permissive rather than compulsory, and is not supported by federal supplemental jurisdiction.  We look, therefore, to whether it rests on an independent federal jurisdictional basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only possible jurisdictional basis would be diversity of citizenship.  While Iglesias and MONY are citizens of different states, MONY did not allege that its claim exceeded any specified sum, nor is its amount ascertainable from the record.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a) (1993) (limiting diversity jurisdiction to claims that exceed a certain amount-in-controversy).  At the time that MONY asserted its counterclaim, the amount-in-controversy required was in excess of $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The burden of alleging jurisdiction is on the party asserting the claim.  See Viqueira v. First Bank, 140 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1998) (stating that \"the proponent ... must carry the burden of demonstrating the existence of federal jurisdiction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although \"the sum claimed by the [proponent] controls if the claim is apparently made in good faith,\" Saint Paul Mercury Indem. Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 U.S. 283, 288, 58 S.Ct. 586, 82 L.Ed. 845 (1938) (footnote omitted), MONY, as noted, has failed to allege that its counterclaim exceeds the required amount-in-controversy nor is there evidence in the record from which its value can reliably be determined as exceeding that amount.  MONY stated merely that it was:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>in the process of reviewing each and everyone [sic] of the expense reports submitted by Mr. Iglesias to determine what was the scope of this practice by Mr. Iglesias and the approximate amount of funds wrongfully taken by Mr. Iglesias from Mutual through the scheme of false expense reports acknowledged by the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, MONY submitted a more detailed accounting of specific instances in which Iglesias alleged excessive or false mileage, but did not state the value of the wrongful claims.  MONY noted that Iglesias had charged $48,500.87 in meal expenses between 1981 and 1988, but it did not indicate what portion of these claims was false or overstated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances--lacking MONY's allegation that the counterclaim meets the jurisdictional amount, and lacking facts of record indicative that this is so--we must conclude that the district court was without jurisdiction to proceed.  We, therefore, remand the counterclaim with directions that it be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3)(\"Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\").  See also United Food &amp; Com. Workers Union v. CenterMark Properties Meriden Square, Inc., 30 F.3d 298, 306 (2d Cir.1994) (addressing for first time on appeal whether district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and remanding for determination of whether amount in controversy requirement had been met).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that Iglesias never pointed out below the absence of a proper amount-in-controversy allegation, nor was the subject raised by anyone.  Had it been raised, MONY might have been able to remedy the deficiency by amendment if it believed in good faith that its counterclaim exceeded the jurisdictional minimum.  In these circumstances, the dismissal we now order shall be without prejudice to MONY's right, if it can do so in good faith, to amend the counterclaim within such time as the district court allows so as to allege a supportably proper jurisdictional amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  If MONY can do so, the district court may lift the jurisdictional bar.  Cf. United Food, 30 F.3d at 306.   If that occurs, the court will be faced with whether to reinstate its previous dismissal with prejudice for untimeliness.  We comment briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because jurisdiction over the counterclaim has not been established, we are without authority to rule whether the district court's dismissal for untimeliness was proper.  Cf. Steel Co., --- U.S. at ----, 118 S.Ct. at 1012.   The issue was, however, presented in this appeal and we believe it would be helpful if we were to state our initial impressions, recognizing their present non-binding character.  MONY brought its counterclaim only four months after Iglesias's November 7, 1991 deposition revealing for the first time that he had continued to falsify his expenses even after similar improprieties were noted in 1987.  In all the circumstances, it is not readily apparent why MONY should be thought tardy in bringing the counterclaim when it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iglesias argues that the counterclaim is barred by laches.  The equitable doctrine of laches allows a court to dismiss a claim \"where a party's delay in bringing suit was (1) unreasonable, and (2) resulted in prejudice to the opposing party.\"  K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., 875 F.2d 907, 911 (1st Cir.1989).  Even if we were to find unreasonable delay within the period between 1987, when MONY first learned that Iglesias had been padding expenses, and 1992, when, after having warned Iglesias earlier, MONY asserted its counterclaim based on the subsequent defalcations, we fail to see how any of that delay prejudiced Iglesias.  Indeed, such prejudice as there was appears to have worked the other way.  The magistrate judge had granted permission to MONY to assert its counterclaim, and the parties thereafter conducted four years of discovery.  MONY sifted through receipts for meals and business trips in an effort to reveal false claims.  The court's dismissal after four years of discovery had been allowed seems to work a hardship on MONY.  Given these equities, we would have serious questions as to the strength of Iglesias's laches argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment for MONY against Iglesias is affirmed.  The order dismissing the counterclaim for untimeliness is vacated and the counterclaim remanded with directions to dismiss the counterclaim without prejudice for want of jurisdiction.

On that date, MONY sent him a letter informing him that he would no longer be authorized to act as Agency Manager.  In the context of the parties' prior discussions regarding Iglesias's retirement, the February 1989 letter put Iglesias on notice that he had been fired.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Iglesias did not file administrative charges with the Anti-Discrimination Division of the Puerto Rico Department of Labor until August 28, 1990, and his initial complaint in federal court was not filed until April 17, 1991.  Iglesias's action for discrimination was, therefore, barred by the applicable statutes of limitations.  See 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e) (establishing a 300-day limitation period for actions under Title VII that were first presented to an administrative agency);  29 U.S.C. &#167; 626(d)(2) (setting a 300-day limitation period for actions under the ADEA that were first brought before a state authority);  Olmo v.

The plain language of the provision purports only to authorize Iglesias to sell MONY's product line, it does not guarantee stability of that line.  MONY is a national company that deals with many agents in diverse geographic areas.  To interpret this contract provision so as to grant each of those agents the power to control which products MONY offers within that particular agent's jurisdiction would give Iglesias and other agents the power to veto policy decisions made by MONY's upper management at the company's national headquarters.  This would flip the employment relationship between MONY and its agents on its head.  Further, each of Iglesias's contracts contained clauses in which MONY reserved the right to change the contract.  The district court's grant of summary judgment was entirely appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p>II. MONY's Counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MONY reimbursed Iglesias for expenses that he incurred as a result of his professional activities.  To supplement his income, Iglesias admits that he \"padded\" his expense reimbursement requests from 1981 to 1988.  MONY first learned of Iglesias's practice of overstating his expenses in 1987.  At that time, MONY took no legal action against Iglesias.  Instead, after notifying him that his conduct conflicted with company policy, MONY requested that he submit accurate reports in the future.  Subsequently, Iglesias brought the present action against MONY for discrimination and breach of contract.  On November 7, 1991, in the course of a deposition, Iglesias admitted that he had continued submitting exaggerated expense reports even after MONY's 1987 warning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">MONY tried to use the information obtained at the 1991 deposition in three ways.  First, MONY questioned Iglesias about his expense reports during trial in an effort to impeach his credibility.  Second, MONY attempted to raise the falsified expense requests as an affirmative defense to Iglesias's discrimination claims, arguing that they provided MONY with a valid non-discriminatory reason to terminate Iglesias.  The court did not allow MONY to pursue this strategy because MONY learned of these improprieties only after it had terminated Iglesias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, and more importantly for our purposes, MONY sought leave to amend its answer to add a counterclaim for restitution.  On March 17, 1992, the magistrate judge granted MONY's request.  For four years, the parties conducted discovery on the counterclaim.  On August 6, 1996, Iglesias moved for dismissal of MONY's counterclaim arguing, inter alia, that it was barred by laches.  On August 14, 1996, the district court dismissed the counterclaim as untimely.  MONY now appeals from that dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although neither of the parties has raised the issue, we have an obligation to inquire into our subject matter jurisdiction over MONY's counterclaim.

See Toste Farm Corp. v.

When considering supplemental jurisdiction, the nature of the counterclaim is crucial.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13 describes two types of counterclaims:  compulsory and permissive.  A compulsory counterclaim is one that \"arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(a).  All counterclaims that are not compulsory are permissive.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 13(b).  Only compulsory counterclaims can rely upon supplemental jurisdiction;  permissive counterclaims require their own jurisdictional basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supplemental jurisdiction statute provides:  \"[I]n any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction, the district courts shall have supplemental jurisdiction over all other claims that are so related to claims in the action within such original jurisdiction that they form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\"  28 U.S.C. &#167; 1367(a).  Section 1367 incorporates the common law doctrines of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction.  See Penobscot Indian Nation v.

Of these tests, only the fourth--the \"logical relation\" test--could possibly encompass MONY's counterclaim.  In McCaffrey, we adopted the Fifth Circuit's treatment of the logical relation test.  Under this approach, a claim qualifies as compulsory only if:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p>it arises out of the same aggregate of operative facts as the original claim in two senses:  (1) that the same aggregate of operative facts serves as the basis of both claims;  or (2) that the aggregate core of facts upon which the original claim rests activates additional legal rights in a party defendant that would otherwise remain dormant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCaffrey, 672 F.2d at 249 (quoting Revere Copper &amp; Brass, Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur.

First, the aggregate of operative facts giving rise to Iglesias's claims is entirely different from the facts supporting MONY's counterclaim.  Iglesias alleges that MONY removed its disability insurance product from the Puerto Rico market in 1981 for discriminatory reasons.  That change in policy, he claims, led to his eventual termination, which therefore was also discriminatory.  The evidence relevant to these claims includes the terms of Iglesias's employment contract and documentary, testimonial or other evidence concerning MONY's actions in Puerto Rico.  By contrast, MONY's counterclaim is for restitution of monies that Iglesias wrongfully obtained from the company over the period from 1981 to 1988.  The facts supporting the restitution claim include Iglesias's records and expense vouchers for travel and meals, his admissions during deposition, and documentary, testimonial or other evidence regarding MONY's reimbursement policies.  Notwithstanding both claims arose during the same time period, they therefore rest on different sets of supporting facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, MONY's ability to recover restitution does not depend on the success or failure of Iglesias's claims.  Iglesias has admitted that he overbilled his expenses to enhance his compensation.  Although MONY discovered Iglesias's false reimbursement requests for 1988 in a deposition that was part of the present action, Iglesias's claims did not \"activate\" otherwise dormant claims.  MONY could have sought reimbursement for its payments based on Iglesias's false expense reports prior to 1988 at any point.  Even MONY's claim relating to 1988 expenses is not tied to the merits of the discrimination and contract claims.  In other words, MONY's counterclaim bears no logical relation to the claims in the main action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that MONY's counterclaim is permissive rather than compulsory, and is not supported by federal supplemental jurisdiction.  We look, therefore, to whether it rests on an independent federal jurisdictional basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only possible jurisdictional basis would be diversity of citizenship.  While Iglesias and MONY are citizens of different states, MONY did not allege that its claim exceeded any specified sum, nor is its amount ascertainable from the record.  See 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1332(a) (1993) (limiting diversity jurisdiction to claims that exceed a certain amount-in-controversy).  At the time that MONY asserted its counterclaim, the amount-in-controversy required was in excess of $50,000, exclusive of interest and costs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The burden of alleging jurisdiction is on the party asserting the claim.

MONY stated merely that it was:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>in the process of reviewing each and everyone [sic] of the expense reports submitted by Mr. Iglesias to determine what was the scope of this practice by Mr. Iglesias and the approximate amount of funds wrongfully taken by Mr. Iglesias from Mutual through the scheme of false expense reports acknowledged by the plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, MONY submitted a more detailed accounting of specific instances in which Iglesias alleged excessive or false mileage, but did not state the value of the wrongful claims.  MONY noted that Iglesias had charged $48,500.87 in meal expenses between 1981 and 1988, but it did not indicate what portion of these claims was false or overstated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these circumstances--lacking MONY's allegation that the counterclaim meets the jurisdictional amount, and lacking facts of record indicative that this is so--we must conclude that the district court was without jurisdiction to proceed.  We, therefore, remand the counterclaim with directions that it be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(h)(3)(\"Whenever it appears by suggestion of the parties or otherwise that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall dismiss the action.\").

Had it been raised, MONY might have been able to remedy the deficiency by amendment if it believed in good faith that its counterclaim exceeded the jurisdictional minimum.  In these circumstances, the dismissal we now order shall be without prejudice to MONY's right, if it can do so in good faith, to amend the counterclaim within such time as the district court allows so as to allege a supportably proper jurisdictional amount.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  If MONY can do so, the district court may lift the jurisdictional bar.  Cf. United Food, 30 F.3d at 306.   If that occurs, the court will be faced with whether to reinstate its previous dismissal with prejudice for untimeliness.  We comment briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because jurisdiction over the counterclaim has not been established, we are without authority to rule whether the district court's dismissal for untimeliness was proper.  Cf. Steel Co., --- U.S. at ----, 118 S.Ct. at 1012.   The issue was, however, presented in this appeal and we believe it would be helpful if we were to state our initial impressions, recognizing their present non-binding character.  MONY brought its counterclaim only four months after Iglesias's November 7, 1991 deposition revealing for the first time that he had continued to falsify his expenses even after similar improprieties were noted in 1987.  In all the circumstances, it is not readily apparent why MONY should be thought tardy in bringing the counterclaim when it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iglesias argues that the counterclaim is barred by laches.  The equitable doctrine of laches allows a court to dismiss a claim \"where a party's delay in bringing suit was (1) unreasonable, and (2) resulted in prejudice to the opposing party.\"  K-Mart Corp. v. Oriental Plaza, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524046\"><a href=\"/opinion/524046/k-mart-corporation-v-oriental-plaza-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 911 (1st Cir.1989).  Even if we were to find unreasonable delay within the period between 1987, when MONY first learned that Iglesias had been padding expenses, and 1992, when, after having warned Iglesias earlier, MONY asserted its counterclaim based on the subsequent defalcations, we fail to see how any of that delay prejudiced Iglesias.  Indeed, such prejudice as there was appears to have worked the other way.  The magistrate judge had granted permission to MONY to assert its counterclaim, and the parties thereafter conducted four years of discovery.  MONY sifted through receipts for meals and business trips in an effort to reveal false claims.  The court's dismissal after four years of discovery had been allowed seems to work a hardship on MONY.  Given these equities, we would have serious questions as to the strength of Iglesias's laches argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment for MONY against Iglesias is affirmed.
