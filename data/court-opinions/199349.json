The appellant argues\n\nthat the district court erred when it granted the appellees'\n\nmotion for a protective order quashing appellant's deposition\n\nsubpoenas.   Appellant claims that this decision was \"plainly\n\nwrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to Appellant.\"   We\n\ndisagree, and for the reasons stated below, affirm the district\n\ncourt's ruling.\n\n                         I.   BACKGROUND\n\n         The appellant, Signal Composites, Inc. d/b/a Signal\n\nAerospace (\"Signal\"), is a party to a civil action pending in\n\nthe United States District Court, Northern District of Texas\n\n(Ameristar Jet Charter, Inc. v. Signal Composites, Inc., et al.,\n\nNo. 3-98-CV-1360-M).   In that action, the plaintiff, Ameristar\n\nJet Charter, Inc. (\"Ameristar\"), seeks damages against Signal\n\nbased upon several causes of action arising out of the alleged\n\nsale of counterfeit combustion liners,1 including breach of\n\nwarranty, fraud and conspiracy to defraud.    The appellees are\n\nnon-party movants General Electric Aircraft Engines (\"GEAE\") and\n\nits employees Paul Whelan, Mark Dancwicz and Dave Cohen.\n\n         A very brief factual history of the underlying action\n\nis necessary to understand how and why GEAE got involved in this\n\n\n\n    1     A combustion liner is part of an aircraft that must\nperiodically be replaced.\n\n                               -3-\n\fcase.      Ameristar operates a jet charter service.             A Texas\n\npartnership,    3-D   Industries   (\"3D\")   purchased,    on   behalf   of\n\nAmeristar, military combustion liners from Signal.             Ameristar\n\nclaims   that   the   combustion   liners   were   represented    to    be\n\nmanufactured by GEAE, or an authorized GEAE vendor, as required\n\nby the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\").          The premises of\n\n3D was visited by the FAA and the Department of Transportation\n\n(\"DOT\").    The FAA and DOT obtained combustion liners, and sent\n\nthem to GEAE for a team of employees to analyze and evaluate for\n\nauthenticity.    The team concluded that the liners differed in a\n\nnumber of ways from GEAE manufactured liners.       Paul Whelan, Mark\n\nDancwicz and David Cohen were some of the GEAE employees on the\n\nteam.\n\n            In March, 1999, Ameristar subpoenaed GEAE pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6).2         GEAE presented two\n\nwitnesses to testify on its behalf in depositions taken on April\n\n8, 1999.    The two witnesses deposed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n\n    2       Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n            A party may in the party's notice and in a\n            subpoena name as the deponent a public or\n            private corporation . . . and describe with\n            reasonable particularity the matters on\n            which examination is requested.     In that\n            event, the organization so named shall\n            designate one or more officers, directors,\n            or managing agents, or other persons who\n            consent to testify on its behalf . . . .\n\n                                   -4-\n\f30(b)(6) were Thomas Woo, GEAE's Mature Engines Program Quality\n\nManager,    who     led   the   team    of    employees    that     analyzed      the\n\ncombustion liners; and Ronald Gould, another member of the team\n\nand   Technical     Leader      for   GEAE's    Engine     Systems      Design    and\n\nIntegration    Group.         Counsel    for    Ameristar     and    Signal      were\n\npresent at the deposition.\n\n            Ameristar moved for partial summary judgment, and on\n\nMarch 27, 2000, Magistrate Judge Boyle issued her findings,\n\nconclusions and recommendations in favor of granting the motion.\n\nOne year after the two GEAE depositions were taken, and after\n\nthe magistrate judge issued her report, Signal moved on April\n\n10,   2000,   to     extend     the    time    to   file   its    objections       to\n\nMagistrate Judge Boyle's report.              On April 10, 2000, Signal also\n\nserved a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition subpoena on GEAE.                       On April\n\n27, 2000, District Judge Lynn granted Signal's motion to extend\n\nthe time within which it had to file objections, but stated that\n\n\"none of the discovery set out in the motion will now be\n\npermitted.\"       She referred any additional discovery requests to\n\nMagistrate Judge Boyle.               On May 2, 2000, Signal subpoenaed\n\ndepositions from GEAE employees Whelan, Dancwicz and Cohen.                        On\n\nMay   16,   2000,    Magistrate       Judge    Boyle   denied     \"at    this    late\n\njuncture\" Signal's request for additional discovery of GEAE and\n\nits employees.\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f           Meanwhile, on May 10, 2000, GEAE and its employees\n\nmoved, in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts, 3   for    a    protective     order   quashing    the   four\n\nsubpoenas issued to them.           Signal opposed that motion.    On June\n\n15, 2000, District Judge Lindsay granted GEAE's motion to quash\n\nthe non-party subpoenas \"both on the merits and because [the]\n\ndiscovery sought appears to be precluded by Judge Boyle's order\n\nof May 16, 2000.\"        Signal now appeals Judge Lindsay's order,\n\narguing that it was \"plainly wrong and resulted in substantial\n\nprejudice to the Appellant.\"\n\n                              II.    DISCUSSION\n\n           The hurdle which the appellant must overcome to prevail\n\nis high.    As we have stated, \"[t]he standard of review in\n\ndiscovery matters is not appellant-friendly.\"           Faigan v. Kelly,\n\n184 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir. 1999).            \"We will intervene in such\n\nmatters only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that\n\nis, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong\n\nand resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\"\n\nMack v. Great Atl. & Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir.\n\n1989).   Signal cannot clear the hurdle; it has not demonstrated\n\n\n\n\n     3    GEAE and its employees are located in Massachusetts\nand, therefore, the subpoenas were issued under the authority of\nthe District Court of Massachusetts.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fthat the district court's order was plainly wrong or that the\n\norder resulted in substantial prejudice.\n\n         The Supreme Court has long recognized that the Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure are to be construed liberally in favor\n\nof discovery.    Hickman v.       Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507 (1947)\n\n(\"[T]he deposition-discovery rules are to be accorded a broad\n\nand liberal treatment.\"); see also SEC v. Sargent, 229 F.3d 68,\n\n80 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Hickman).             There are, however,\n\nlimitations on pre-trial discovery.             Mack, 871 F.2d at 187\n\n(discussing   amendments   made    to    the   Federal   Rules   of   Civil\n\nProcedure \"to deal with the problem of over-discovery\").\n\n         Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(2) provides, in\n\npertinent part, that discovery\n\n         shall be limited by the court if it\n         determines that: (i) the discovery sought is\n         unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or\n         is obtainable from some other source that is\n         more convenient, less burdensome, or less\n         expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery\n         has had ample opportunity by discovery in\n         the action to obtain the information sought;\n         or (iii) the burden or expense of the\n         proposed discovery outweighs its likely\n         benefit . . . .\n\n         Rule 26(c) provides for protective orders, issued by\n\nthe district court, to limit or eliminate discovery sought.\n\nUpon a showing of \"good cause\" by the movant, a court \"may make\n\nany order which justice requires to protect a party or person\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\ffrom annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or\n\nexpense . . . .\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).\n\n            Further, Rule 45(c)(3)(A) gives the court the power to\n\n\"quash or modify the subpoena if it . . . (iii) requires\n\ndisclosure    of   privileged   or   other   protected   matter   and   no\n\nexception or waiver applies, or (iv) subjects a person to undue\n\nburden.\"\n\n            At issue in this appeal are four deposition subpoenas\n\nissued on behalf of Signal to GEAE and its employees Whelan,\n\nDancwicz and Cohen.      GEAE had been subpoenaed by Ameristar in\n\nMarch of 1999 in the same case.        We rule that the district court\n\ncorrectly granted the appellees' protective order to quash all\n\nfour subpoenas.     Our reasons follow.\n\n            First, it was not \"plainly wrong\" for the district\n\ncourt to quash the subpoena issued to GEAE pursuant to Rule\n\n30(b)(6).    Pursuant to Rule 30(a)(2)(B), \"[a] party must obtain\n\nleave of court . . . if . . . the person to be examined already\n\nhas been deposed in the case . . . .\"        Here, GEAE was previously\n\ndeposed.    On April 8, 1999, GEAE presented two witnesses--Thomas\n\nWoo and Ronald Gould--to testify on its behalf.             Counsel for\n\nSignal was present.     One year later and after Magistrate Judge\n\nBoyle's recommendation for partial summary judgment against it,\n\nSignal issued a Rule 30(b)(6) subpoena to GEAE.            Because this\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fsecond Rule 30(b)(6) subpoena was issued to GEAE without leave\n\nof the court, it was invalid.         Even assuming arguendo that\n\nSignal sought leave of the Texas District Court4 to re-depose\n\nGEAE pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6), such request was denied by\n\nMagistrate Judge Boyle on May 16, 2000.         For the foregoing\n\nreasons, it was not \"plainly wrong\" for Judge Lindsay to grant\n\nthe protective order quashing the second Rule 30(b)(6) subpoena\n\nissued to GEAE.\n\n          We next turn to the three individual subpoenas issued\n\nto GEAE employees Whelan, Dancwicz and Cohen in May, 2000.       The\n\ndistrict court was not \"plainly wrong\" when it quashed the\n\nsubpoenas issued to the three employees, and Signal has not\n\nshown that it was \"substantially prejudiced\" by the court's\n\nruling.\n\n          Unsatisfied with the findings and recommendations of\n\nMagistrate Judge Boyle, Signal attempted to depose three other\n\nmembers of the GEAE team.   This request was belated, duplicative\n\nand   cumulative,   and   otherwise   unduly   burdensome   to   the\n\nappellees.   Two GEAE representatives were already deposed, and\n\n\n\n      4   Arguably, Signal requested additional discovery when\nit moved for an extension of time within which to file its\nobjections   to   Magistrate   Judge   Boyle's   findings   and\nrecommendations.   We need not decide whether Signal actually\nrequested leave of the court, as it was required to do pursuant\nto Rule 30(a)(2), because the result is the same.\n\n                                -9-\n\fSignal did not articulate any dissatisfaction with the testimony\n\nit received.       Moreover, it did not seek additional testimony\n\nuntil      after   Magistrate       Boyle      issued       her    findings     and\n\nrecommendations a year later.\n\n             Signal presents no evidence that any new, relevant\n\ninformation will be obtained if it is permitted to take the\n\ndepositions of the three GEAE employees.                     Signal merely has\n\n\"hope\" that the testimony of Whelan, Dancwicz or Cohen will\n\ncontradict the testimony of the GEAE representatives already\n\ndeposed.     Counsel for Signal concedes, however, that it has no\n\nevidence that it will receive contradictory testimony.                       We will\n\nnot allow Signal to go on a \"fishing expedition,\" with the mere\n\n\"hope\" that it will obtain such information.                 See Mack, 871 F.2d\n\nat   187    (holding   that    a    party      may    not    \"undertake      wholly\n\nexploratory operations in the vague hope that something helpful\n\nwill turn up.\").\n\n             The   district    court     has    the     discretion      to    limit\n\ndiscovery.     The court may limit discovery if it determines that\n\n\"the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative,\n\nor is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient,\n\nless burdensome, or less expensive . . . .\"                       Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n26(b)(2)(i).        Signal    had   an   opportunity         to    question    GEAE\n\nrepresentatives and did so in March, 1999.                  See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f26(b)(2)(ii).   Signal has not shown that the information sought\n\nfrom Whelan, Dancwicz or Cohen would be anything but cumulative\n\nor duplicative.   Therefore, it would be an \"undue burden\" on\n\nGEAE, a non-party, to permit such a \"fishing expedition.\"   Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 26(c) (a court \"may make any order which justice\n\nrequires to protect a party or person from . . . undue burden\").\n\n                        III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          For the aforementioned reasons, the district court was\n\nnot \"plainly wrong\" when it granted the appellees' motion for a\n\nprotective order to quash the four subpoenas and the appellant\n\nhas not shown that it was \"substantially prejudiced\" by this\n\norder.   The order of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

Ameristar operates a jet charter service. A Texas partnership, 3-D Industries (\"3D\") purchased, on behalf of Ameristar, military combustion liners from Signal. Ameristar claims that the combustion liners were represented to be manufactured by GEAE, or an authorized GEAE vendor, as required by the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\").

Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 84 (1st Cir. 1999). \"We will intervene in such matters only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\" Mack v. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co., 871 F.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir. 1989). Signal cannot clear the hurdle; it has not demonstrated that the district court's order was plainly wrong or that the order resulted in substantial prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has long recognized that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are to be construed liberally in favor of discovery. Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 507 (1947) (\"[T]he deposition-discovery rules are to be accorded a broad and liberal treatment.\"); see also SECav. Sargent, 229 F.3d 68, 80 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting Hickman). There are, however, limitations on pre-trial discovery. Mack, 871 F.2d at 187 (discussing amendments made to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \"to deal with the problem of over-discovery\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(2) provides, in pertinent part, that discovery</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be limited by the court if it determines that: (i) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; (ii) the party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity by discovery in the action to obtain the information sought; or (iii) the burden or expense of the proposed discovery outweighs its likely benefit . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 26(c) provides for protective orders, issued by the district court, to limit or eliminate discovery sought. Upon a showing of \"good cause\" by the movant, a court \"may make any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense . . . .\" Fed.

GEAE had been subpoenaed by Ameristar in March of 1999 in the same case. We rule that the district court correctly granted the appellees' protective order to quash all four subpoenas. Our reasons follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it was not \"plainly wrong\" for the district court to quash the subpoena issued to GEAE pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6). Pursuant to Rule 30(a)(2)(B), \"[a] party must obtain leave of court . . . if . . . the person to be examined already has been deposed in the case . . . .\" Here, GEAE was previously deposed. On Aprila8, 1999, GEAE presented two witnesses--Thomas Woo and Ronald Gould--to testify on its behalf. Counsel for Signal was present. One year later and after Magistrate Judge Boyle's recommendation for partial summary judgment against it, Signal issued a Rule 30(b)(6) subpoena to GEAE. Because this second Rule 30(b)(6) subpoena was issued to GEAE without leave of the court, it was invalid. Even assuming arguendo that Signal sought leave of the Texas District Court<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> to re-depose GEAE pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6), such request was denied by Magistrate Judge Boyle on May 16, 2000. For the foregoing reasons, it was not \"plainly wrong\" for Judge Lindsay to grant the protective order quashing the second Rule 30(b)(6) subpoena issued to GEAE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next turn to the three individual subpoenas issued to GEAE employees Whelan, Dancwicz and Cohen in May, 2000. The district court was not \"plainly wrong\" when it quashed the subpoenas issued to the three employees, and Signal has not shown that it was \"substantially prejudiced\" by the court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unsatisfied with the findings and recommendations of Magistrate Judge Boyle, Signal attempted to depose three other members of the GEAE team. This request was belated, duplicative and cumulative, and otherwise unduly burdensome to the appellees. Two GEAE representatives were already deposed, and Signal did not articulate any dissatisfaction with the testimony it received. Moreover, it did not seek additional testimony until after Magistrate Boyle issued her findings and recommendations a year later.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Signal presents no evidence that any new, relevant information will be obtained if it is permitted to take the depositions of the three GEAE employees. Signal merely has \"hope\" that the testimony of Whelan, Dancwicz or Cohen will contradict the testimony of the GEAE representatives already deposed. Counsel for Signal concedes, however, that it has no evidence that it will receive contradictory testimony. We will not allow Signal to go on a \"fishing expedition,\" with the mere \"hope\" that it will obtain such information. See Mack, 871 F.2d at 187 (holding that a party may not \"undertake wholly exploratory operations in the vague hope that something helpful will turn up.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court has the discretion to limit discovery. The court may limit discovery if it determines that \"the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive . . . .\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(i). Signal had an opportunity to question GEAE representatives and did so in March, 1999. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(2)(ii). Signal has not shown that the information sought from Whelan, Dancwicz or Cohen would be anything but cumulative or duplicative. Therefore, it would be an \"undue burden\" on GEAE, a non-party, to permit such a \"fishing expedition.\" Fed. R. Civ.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant, Signal Composites, Inc. d/b/a Signal Aerospace (\"Signal\"), is a party to a civil action pending in the United States District Court, Northern District of Texas (Ameristar Jet Charter, Inc. v. Signal Composites, Inc., et al., No. 3-98-CV-1360-M). In that action, the plaintiff, Ameristar Jet Charter, Inc. (\"Ameristar\"), seeks damages against Signal based upon several causes of action arising out of the alleged sale of counterfeit combustion liners,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> including breach of warranty, fraud and conspiracy to defraud. The appellees are non-party movants General Electric Aircraft Engines (\"GEAE\") and its employees Paul Whelan, Mark Dancwicz and Dave Cohen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A very brief factual history of the underlying action is necessary to understand how and why GEAE got involved in this case. Ameristar operates a jet charter service. A Texas partnership, 3-D Industries (\"3D\") purchased, on behalf of Ameristar, military combustion liners from Signal. Ameristar claims that the combustion liners were represented to be manufactured by GEAE, or an authorized GEAE vendor, as required by the Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\"). The premises of 3D was visited by the FAA and the Department of Transportation (\"DOT\"). The FAA and DOT obtained combustion liners, and sent them to GEAE for a team of employees to analyze and evaluate for authenticity. The team concluded that the liners differed in a number of ways from GEAE manufactured liners. Paul Whelan, Mark Dancwicz and David Cohen were some of the GEAE employees on the team.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March, 1999, Ameristar subpoenaed GEAE pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(b)(6).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> GEAE presented two witnesses to testify on its behalf in depositions taken on April 8, 1999. The two witnesses deposed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(b)(6) were Thomas Woo, GEAE's Mature Engines Program Quality Manager, who led the team of employees that analyzed the combustion liners; and Ronald Gould, another member of the team and Technical Leader for GEAE's Engine Systems Design and Integration Group. Counsel for Ameristar and Signal were present at the deposition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ameristar moved for partial summary judgment, and on March 27, 2000, Magistrate Judge Boyle issued her findings, conclusions and recommendations in favor of granting the motion. One year after the two GEAE depositions were taken, and after the magistrate judge issued her report, Signal moved on April 10, 2000, to extend the time to file its objections to Magistrate Judge Boyle's report. On April 10, 2000, Signal also served a Rule 30(b)(6) deposition subpoena on GEAE. On April 27, 2000, District Judge Lynn granted Signal's motion to extend the time within which it had to file objections, but stated that \"none of the discovery set out in the motion will now be permitted.\" She referred any additional discovery requests to Magistrate Judge Boyle. On May 2, 2000, Signal subpoenaed depositions from GEAE employees Whelan, Dancwicz and Cohen. On May 16, 2000, Magistrate Judge Boyle denied \"at this late juncture\" Signal's request for additional discovery of GEAE and its employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, on May 10, 2000, GEAE and its employees moved, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> for a protective order quashing the four subpoenas issued to them. Signal opposed that motion. On June 15, 2000, District Judge Lindsay granted GEAE's motion to quash the non-party subpoenas \"both on the merits and because [the] discovery sought appears to be precluded by Judge Boyle's order of May 16, 2000.\" Signal now appeals Judge Lindsay's order, arguing that it was \"plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the Appellant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.
