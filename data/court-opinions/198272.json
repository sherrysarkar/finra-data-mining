Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n\n           Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n              and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\nDavid J. Fine, with whom Dangel, Donlan and Fine was on brief\r\nfor appellant.\r\nThomas E. Sweeney, City Solicitor, for appellee City of\r\nLowell.\r\nNeil Sheering, with whom Michelle A. Kaczynski, Assistant\r\nAttorney General and Scott Harshbarger, Attorney General, were on\r\nbrief for appellee Gerald Feigin, M.D.\r\nJoseph G. Donnellan for appellees Daniel R. Brady, Barry\r\nChevalier and Lewis Hunter.\r\nAustin M. Joyce, with whom Michael J. Akerson and Reardon &amp;\r\nReardon were on brief for appellees William M. Taylor and William\r\nF. Busby.\r\n\nNovember 18, 1998\r\n\nCAMPBELL, Senior Circuit Judge.  Rebecca Judge brought\r\nthis action pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983 against the City of\r\nLowell, Officers John J. Sheehan, Daniel R. Brady, William M.\r\nTaylor, William F. Busby, Lewis Hunter, Barry Chevalier, David\r\nTousignant, and Garrett Sheehan of the Lowell Police Department (in\r\ntheir individual capacities), and Medical Examiner Gerald Feigin,\r\nM.D. (in his individual capacity), for alleged violations of the\r\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\r\nStates Constitution.  Judge also brought claims under state law\r\nagainst Dr. Feigin and Officer Chevalier for intentional infliction\r\nof emotional distress.  Defendants moved to dismiss the section\r\n1983 claims in Judge's Third Amended Complaint pursuant to Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to set forth a claim for relief.  The\r\ncourt granted defendants' motions to dismiss the section 1983\r\nclaims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\r\nremaining state law claims.  Judge appeals from the order granting\r\ndefendants' motions to dismiss.  We affirm. \r\n                    I.  BACKGROUND \r\nWe summarize the facts and allegations set forth in the\r\nThird Amended Complaint.  Judge, who is black, is the sister of\r\nGary Weems, who died on November 6, 1993.  Weems was also black. \r\nOn the date of Weems's death, both Judge and Weems resided at 7\r\nWalter Terrace in Somerville, Massachusetts.  Weems married Denise\r\nRichardson Weems in 1980, but they had been separated for several\r\nyears at the time of Weems's death. \r\nThe Lowell Police Department discovered Weems's body on\r\nor about November 6, 1993.  At that time, Weems had on his person\r\nvarious forms of identification that indicated that he lived at 7\r\nWalter Terrace.  He also had a bank passbook indicating that he and\r\nJudge jointly held a savings account.  Notwithstanding the\r\ndiscovery of these items, the Lowell Police Department did not\r\ncontact Judge or any other member of Weems's family to inform them\r\nof Weems's death.  As a result, Judge did not learn of her\r\nbrother's death until approximately six weeks after it occurred. \r\nIn the interim, Weems was buried in Lowell as an \"unknown person.\"\r\nAfter the Lowell Police Department discovered Weems's\r\nbody, it conducted a homicide investigation.  Police officers took\r\nwitness statements from three individuals.  Those statements\r\nindicated that Weems may have died as a result of an injection of\r\nnarcotics administered by another person.  In their statements, the\r\nwitnesses contradicted one another as to the identity of the person\r\nor persons who administered the injection.  The witnesses also\r\nindicated that (1) Weems had received over $90 in cash around 4:00\r\np.m. on November 5, 1993, but had no cash on his person when his\r\nbody was discovered the next day, and (2) at some point during the\r\nnight of November 5, 1993, Weems's pockets were turned inside out. \r\nNotwithstanding this evidence, the officers did not investigate\r\nWeems's death further.  The officers did not interview additional\r\npersons who may have been present at the time of Weems's death. \r\nThey did not seek out and interview any of Weems's family members. \r\nJudge learned of Weems's death sometime in December,\r\n1993.  Shortly after learning that Weems had died, Judge, along\r\nwith Denise Weems and Jestina Richardson, Denise Weems's mother\r\n(both of whom are also black), went to the office of Gerald Feigin,\r\nthe Medical Examiner who had performed an autopsy on Weems's body. \r\nInitially, Dr. Feigin resisted meeting with the women.  After Dr.\r\nFeigin agreed to meet with them, Judge asked Feigin to show the\r\nwomen something to demonstrate that the body that had been buried\r\napproximately six weeks earlier was that of Gary Weems.  Dr. Feigin\r\n\"reacted angrily and shoved a photograph of the dead man so far\r\ninto Ms. Judge's face that she could not see it.\"  (Third Amended\r\nComplaint,  22.)  When Judge requested further information\r\nconcerning the circumstances of Weems's death, Dr. Feigin \"started\r\nyelling at the three women that he had showed [sic] them the\r\nphotograph, that the photograph should be good enough for them and\r\nthat he did not have time 'for this.'\"  See id.  \r\nJudge alleges on information and belief that at the time\r\nDr. Feigin prepared his autopsy report concerning Weems, he was\r\naware of the \"suspicious circumstances\" discovered by the police,\r\nyet failed to include this information in his report.  Dr. Feigin\r\ndid not make any recommendation to the district attorney's office\r\nthat Weems's death be further investigated.   \r\nJudge, Denise Weems and Ms. Richardson also visited the\r\nLowell Police Department.  The women spoke to an officer, believed\r\nto be Officer Chavalier, who, during their conversation, used the\r\nstreet names of certain drugs.  When Judge indicated that she did\r\nnot understand what the officer was referring to, \"the officer\r\nresponded in a manner which insinuated that because she was Black,\r\nshe must know what he was referring to, and her claim that she did\r\nnot know was disingenuous.\"  When Judge asked the officer whether\r\nthe police had found any forms of identification on Weems's person,\r\nthe officer replied that they had not.  When Judge asked for the\r\nreturn of Weems's personal belongings, the officer stated that the\r\nonly item found on Weems's person was a knife.  In response to\r\nquestions concerning the circumstances of Weems's death, the\r\nofficer \"provided misleading and incomplete information.\"   \r\nIn her Third Amended Complaint, Judge asserted four\r\nclaims for relief.  In Count I, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \r\n1983, she alleged that the officer defendants and Dr. Feigin\r\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \r\nJudge alleged that Dr. Feigin and the officer defendants \"violated\r\ntheir constitutional duty by discriminating against Rebecca Judge\r\non the basis of her race and the race of her deceased brother Gary\r\nWeems and his wife Denise Weems,\" in that they failed to: (1)\r\nnotify Weems's wife and next of kin of Weems's death; (2) deliver\r\nin a timely fashion to Weems's wife and next of kin Weems's\r\npersonal belongings; (3) carefully inquire into the cause and\r\ncircumstances of Gary Weems's death; (4) respect the right of Gary\r\nWeems's wife and next of kin to dispose of his body as they wished;\r\n(5) respond truthfully to requests for information regarding Gary\r\nWeems's death made by members of Gary Weems's family;\r\n(6)investigate the circumstances of Gary Weems's death with due\r\nregard to the possibility that the death may have resulted from\r\ncriminal acts; (7) pursue carefully evidence of suspicious\r\ncircumstances regarding Gary Weems's death; and (8) notify the\r\ndistrict attorney's office of evidence warranting the attention of\r\nthat office.  \r\nJudge alleged \"on information and belief\" that the above\r\nconduct \"would not have been characterized by the gross\r\ndeficiencies with which it was characterized had [she], her\r\ndeceased brother Gary Weems and his wife Denise Weems been White,\r\ninstead of Black.\"  Judge further alleged that these circumstances \r\n     were part and parcel of a pattern and\r\n     practice, pursuant to which one level\r\n     of care is used by defendants in the\r\n     investigation of the deaths of White\r\n     persons, and another, inferior level of\r\n     care is used by defendants in the\r\n     investigation of the death of Black\r\n     persons, particularly if the Black\r\n     persons in question are ostensibly of a\r\n     low economic class and the cause of\r\n     death is ostensibly a drug overdose. \r\n\nId.,  33.  As support for this \"pattern and practice\" allegation,\r\nJudge cited the case of Kasha Blount, a black woman from Dorcester,\r\nMassachusetts, who died in February 1990 under allegedly suspicious\r\ncircumstances.  According to newspaper articles appended to the\r\nThird Amended Complaint, a man was tried in the Blount case on\r\nhomicide charges, but was acquitted by a jury.  The articles\r\nindicate that Dr. Feigin was the medical examiner in the Blount\r\ncase.  Relying upon statements made by Blount's mother to the\r\npress, Judge alleges that Dr. Feigin failed to properly investigate\r\nMs. Blount's death because she was black.\r\nIn Count II, Judge alleged that the City of Lowell had\r\nexhibited \"deliberate indifference\" by failing to \"establish a\r\ncustom and policy that prohibited discrimination on the basis of\r\nrace in the discharge of the legal obligations at issue,\" and by\r\nfailing to recruit and train its police officers \"in such a way as\r\nto ensure that they would not discriminate on the basis of race in\r\nthe discharge of the legal obligations at issue.\"  In Counts III\r\nand IV, Judge alleged state law claims for intentional infliction\r\nof emotional distress against Dr. Feigin and Officer Chevalier.\r\nAfter Judge filed her initial complaint, she amended it\r\nthree times.  The defendants filed motions to dismiss the Second\r\nAmended Complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure\r\nto state a claim for relief under section 1983.  At a scheduling\r\nconference held after those motions were filed, the court expressed\r\nskepticism that the Second Amended Complaint set forth sufficient\r\nfactual support for Judge's allegation of racial animus. \r\nNevertheless, the court denied the motions to dismiss without\r\nprejudice to their being renewed at a later date.  Judge filed a\r\nThird Amended Complaint, in which she elaborated on the specific\r\nalleged omissions of the defendant officers and Dr. Feigin, and\r\ncited the Blount case.  The defendants renewed their motions to\r\ndismiss for failure to state a claim, and the court granted the \r\nmotions.  The court denied Judge's motion to reconsider and her\r\nmotion for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint.  Having\r\ndismissed the federal claims set forth in Counts I and II, the\r\ncourt declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the two\r\nremaining state law causes of action (Counts III and IV) and\r\ndismissed them as well.  \r\n                   II.  DISCUSSION   \r\nJudge argues on appeal that the district court erred in\r\ndismissing her Third Amended Complaint.  We conclude that the\r\ndistrict court properly dismissed Counts I and II of Judge's Third\r\nAmended Complaint and, having done so, properly dismissed the\r\nremaining state law claims.  Judge also challenges the denial of\r\nher motion for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint.  We\r\nconclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying\r\nthat motion.  \r\nA.  Dismissal of the Third Amended Complaint\r\nWe review the disposition of a motion to dismiss de novo. \r\nSee LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 142 F.3d 507, 509 (1st\r\nCir. 1998).  Rule 8(a) provides that the complaint must contain \"a\r\nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\r\nentitled to relief.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).  In an oft-quoted \r\ngloss, the Supreme Court stated over forty years ago that a\r\ncomplaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim\r\n\"unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set\r\nof facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to\r\nrelief.\"  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957). \r\nNotwithstanding Conley, this circuit and others have held\r\nthat in civil rights cases such as the present, a bare conclusory\r\nallegation of the critical element of illegal intent, including of\r\nan intent to discriminate, is insufficient.  We have required the\r\nplaintiff \"to allege particulars sufficient to sanction a\r\nfactfinder in drawing a reasonable inference of intentional\r\ndisparate treatment based on race.\"  The Dartmouth Review v.\r\nDartmouth College, 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir. 1989).  Put another\r\nway, the element of illegal motive must be pleaded by alleging \r\nspecific non-conclusory facts from which such a motive may\r\nreasonably be inferred, not merely by generalized asseveration\r\nalone.  See Correa-Martinez v. Arillaga-Belendez, 903 F.2d 49, 51\r\n(1st Cir. 1990) (requiring that alleged facts in complaint\r\n\"specifically identify the particular instance(s) of discriminatory\r\ntreatment and, as a logical exercise, adequately support the thesis\r\nthat the discrimination was unlawful\").\r\nThe above-mentioned cases in this circuit predate the\r\nSupreme Court's decision in Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics\r\nIntelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.S. 163 (1993), as well as\r\nthe Court's very recent decision in Crawford-El v. Britton, 118 S.\r\nCt. 1584 (1998).  As the district court relied upon the earlier\r\nFirst Circuit caselaw in determining that the Third Amended\r\nComplaint was legally inadequate, we must decide whether the\r\nrequirement stated in those cases survives Leatherman and Crawford-\r\nEl.  Based particularly on the Court's dicta in Crawford-El, infra, \r\nwe believe that it does, at least in a case like the present\r\nalleging a constitutional violation calling for proof of an illegal\r\nmotive.  We also believe, contrary to Judge's contentions, that the\r\ndistrict court did not err in its manner of applying our precedents\r\nto the Third Amended Complaint.\r\nWere Leatherman the Supreme Court's last and only word,\r\nwe would be less certain of the correctness of our refusal, in\r\ncircumstances like the present, to accept purely conclusory\r\npleading on the element of discriminatory intent.  In Leatherman,\r\nthe Court rejected a heightened pleading standard imposed by the\r\nFifth Circuit in cases alleging municipal liability under section\r\n1983.  The case arose out of complaints filed against two\r\nmunicipalities for their officers' forcible entry into residences\r\nthe officers suspected were fronts for drug-manufacturing\r\noperations.  The district court and the Fifth Circuit, both\r\napplying the latter's heightened pleading standard in civil rights\r\ncases, held that the complaints should be dismissed.  The Supreme\r\nCourt reversed.\r\nThe Court found it \"impossible to square the 'heightened\r\npleading standard' applied by the Fifth Circuit . . . with the\r\nliberal system of 'notice pleading' set up by the Federal Rules.\" \r\nLeatherman, 507 U.S. at 168.  The defendants in Leatherman argued\r\nthat a heightened pleading requirement was necessary because \"a\r\nmore relaxed pleading requirement would subject municipalities to\r\nexpensive and time consuming discovery in every  1983 case,\r\neviscerating their immunity from suit and disrupting municipal\r\nfunctions.\"  Id.  The Supreme Court observed, however, that \"unlike\r\nvarious government officials, municipalities do not enjoy immunity\r\nfrom suit   either absolute or qualified,\" id., suggesting the\r\nresult might be different in individual capacity actions against\r\ngovernment officials.  The Court specifically reserved judgment on\r\nthe question whether its \"qualified immunity jurisprudence would\r\nrequire a heightened pleading in cases involving individual\r\ngovernment officials.\"  Id. \r\n Judge argues that in Crawford-El, the Court answered\r\nthat question in the negative.  We are not so sure, but, in any\r\ncase, immunity was not (as the Supreme Court pointed out) the key\r\nissue there, any more than it was here.  In Crawford-El, the\r\nSupreme Court rejected the D.C. Circuit's requirement that a\r\nplaintiff bringing a claim under section 1983 against a government\r\nofficial in his or her individual capacity, regarding which the\r\nofficial's improper motive is a necessary element, adduce \"clear\r\nand convincing evidence\" of such motive in order to defeat a motion\r\nfor summary judgment.  118 S. Ct. at 1595.  The Court of Appeals\r\nhad adopted this heightened evidentiary requirement to protect\r\ngovernment officials, in a doubtful case, from the burdens of\r\ndiscovery and trial.  The Supreme Court held that the D.C. Circuit\r\nwent too far in increasing the plaintiff's evidentiary burden.  \r\nThe Court continued, however, with strong dicta dealing squarely\r\nwith the issue now before us.  Indicating awareness and some\r\nsympathy with \"the potential problem that troubled the court,\" the\r\nSupreme Court said that it was \"therefore appropriate to add a few\r\nwords on some of the existing procedures available to federal trial\r\njudges in handling claims that involve examination of an official's\r\nstate of mind.\"   Id. at 1596.  The Court stated that\r\n[w]hen a plaintiff files a complaint against a\r\npublic official alleging a claim that requires\r\nproof of wrongful motive, the trial court must\r\nexercise its discretion in a way that protects\r\nthe substance of the qualified immunity\r\ndefense.  It must exercise its  discretion so\r\nthat officials are not subjected to\r\nunnecessary and burdensome discovery or trial\r\nproceedings. \r\n\nId.  \r\nOne way of accomplishing this, the Court went on, was for \r\ntrial courts, prior to permitting any discovery, to use existing\r\nprocedures, such as ordering a plaintiff to reply to a defendant's\r\nanswer or granting defendant's motion for a more definite\r\nstatement, to require that plaintiffs allege specific facts\r\nsupporting an allegation of wrongful motive.  Id. at 1596.  The\r\nSupreme Court then stated, in unequivocal language directly\r\nrelevant to the issue under consideration, that \"the [trial] court\r\nmay insist that the plaintiff 'put forward specific, nonconclusory\r\nfactual allegations' that establish improper motive causing\r\ncognizable injury in order to survive a prediscovery motion for\r\ndismissal or summary judgment.\"  Id. (quoting in part Siegert v.\r\nGilley, 500 U.S. 226, 236 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in\r\njudgment)).  \"This option exists,\" the Court went on to state,\r\n\"even if the official chooses not to plead the affirmative defense\r\nof qualified immunity.\"  Id. at 1597.    \r\nJudge's Count I section 1983 claim rests upon \r\nallegations of unconstitutional motive (i.e., intent to\r\ndiscriminate because of race) on the part of several defendants\r\nsued in their individual capacities.  See infra.  In Crawford-El,\r\nthe Supreme Court recognized that claims against individual public\r\nofficials have the potential to subject them to burdensome\r\ndiscovery and trials and stated that district judges may dispose of\r\nsuch claims prior to permitting any discovery where a plaintiff,\r\nhaving been provided the opportunity to do so, fails to allege\r\n\"specific, nonconclusory factual allegations that establish \r\nimproper motive.\"  118 S. Ct at 1596 (emphasis provided).  We\r\nconclude, therefore, that the five Justices writing for the Court\r\nin Crawford-El permitted an approach similar to ours in Dartmouth\r\nReview and Correa-Martinez, calling for the pleading of specific\r\nfacts from which to infer illegal motive   although the Court\r\nlimited its carefully-phrased endorsement of that approach to\r\nconstitutional claims in which \"improper motive\" was an essential\r\nelement for plaintiff to prove.  See Crawford-El, 118 S. Ct. at\r\n1596.  As Count I here precisely involves an action under section\r\n1983 against state officials in their individual capacities\r\nrequiring plaintiff to prove improper motive, see infra, we regard\r\nthe majority's carefully-fashioned dicta in Crawford-El as allowing\r\nthe continued use here of the standard reflected in this circuit's\r\nprevious caselaw and applied below. \r\nWe therefore examine Count I of Judge's Third Amended\r\nComplaint to determine whether it meets the standard permitted in\r\nCrawford-El (\"specific, nonconclusory factual allegations that\r\nestablish that defendant acted based upon an improper motive\"), a\r\nstandard, as we say, similar to that articulated by this circuit in\r\nDartmouth Review and progeny.  In so applying that standard, we\r\nbear in mind that, in Count I, Judge alleged that the federal right\r\nshe was denied was the right to equal protection of the laws under\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  One who asserts that governmental action\r\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause must show that he or she is\r\n\"the victim of intentional discrimination.\"  Texas Dept. of\r\nCommunity Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981); see also \r\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976) (\"The central purpose\r\nof the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is the\r\nprevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of\r\nrace.\").  In order to state a claim under the Equal Protection\r\nClause, a plaintiff must allege not only that the defendants were\r\naware of her race at the time of their actions, but also that\r\ndefendants acted because of her race.  See Personnel Administratorv. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979).  \"Improper motive\" is,\r\ntherefore, a key element of proof in the instant case, entitling\r\nthe district court to demand, as already said, that such motive be\r\npleaded not just conclusorily but by specific, nonconclusoryfactual allegations giving rise to a reasonable inference of\r\nracially discriminatory intent.  See Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at\r\n16.    \r\nJudge alleges in Count I that the defendants failed to\r\ncarry out various duties in connection with the discovery of\r\nWeems's body and the investigation of Weems's death.  First, Judge\r\nalleges that the defendants failed to notify her of Weems's death\r\nin a timely manner, which caused her brother to be buried as an\r\n\"unknown person.\"While the defendants each moved to dismiss the complaint\r\nfor lack of standing based upon the absence of any right under\r\nstate law for Judge to possess Weems's body, counsel for Judge\r\nmade clear during oral argument on the motions to dismiss that\r\nJudge's claims were not grounded upon any such interest:\r\n\n     Court:  But the whole theory of your case is that\r\n     the plaintiff was not, or members of the family,\r\n     were not told of the deceased passing, and he was\r\n     buried.  Isn't that the gravamen of the case?\r\n\n     Mr. Fine (Counsel for Judge):  No. \r\n\nSecond, Judge alleges that the government\r\nofficials   the officer defendants and Dr. Feigin   failed,\r\nrespectively, to conduct an adequate homicide investigation and\r\nprepare a proper  autopsy report, despite the existence of\r\n\"suspicious circumstances.\"  Third, Judge alleges that defendants\r\nwere rude to her when she sought information concerning Weems's\r\ndeath.  Judge alleges that all of these omissions occurred because\r\nshe is black.  In sum, Judge alleges a double standard whereby\r\ndeaths of black persons that occur under suspicious circumstances\r\nare treated differently (i.e., less seriously) than deaths of white\r\npersons under similar circumstances, and that the families of the\r\nblack decedents are injured by this disparate treatment.  \r\nAssociated with the above, Judge made several other more\r\nspecific assertions:  First, that when Judge confronted Dr. Feigin\r\nand Officer Chevalier approximately six weeks after Weems's death,\r\nthey failed to provide her basic and accurate information\r\nconcerning the circumstances of Weems's death and engaged in rude,\r\ninsulting and unprofessional behavior.  Second, Judge alleges that\r\nOfficer Chevalier \"insinuated\" that she knew the street names for\r\ncertain drugs.  Third, Judge alleges that her allegation of\r\ndisparate treatment based on race is supported by the facts of the\r\nKasha Blount case, a state court proceeding reported in the\r\nnewspaper which involved a black teenager who died in Dorchester\r\nunder suspicious circumstances and an allegedly mishandled autopsy\r\nperformed by Dr. Feigin.  Neither separately nor taken with the\r\nothers, however, do these alleged facts give rise, by themselves,\r\nto a reasonable inference that defendants were motivated by racial\r\nconsiderations.             \r\nState actors will, of course, violate the Equal\r\nProtection Clause if they deliberately and selectively deny\r\nprotective services to the members of a disfavored minority.  SeeDeShaney v. Winnebago County, 489 U.S. 189, 197 n.3 (1989).  But,\r\nas we said in Dartmouth Review, \"merely juxtaposing the fact of\r\none's race with an instance of discrimination is insufficient to\r\nstate a claim.\"  Id. at 19.  In Dartmouth Review, white student\r\neditors of an off-campus newspaper who were suspended following a\r\nconfrontation with a black professor brought a civil rights action\r\nagainst the college and various college officials, alleging that\r\ntheir suspension was racially motivated.  The district court\r\ndismissed their complaint for failure to state a claim.  We\r\naffirmed, holding that \"[a]bsent some meaningful, fact-specific\r\nallegation of a causal link between defendant's conduct and\r\nplaintiff's race, the complaint's first count cannot stand.\"  Id. \r\nThus, to survive a motion to dismiss Count I, Judge must set forth\r\nspecific factual allegations supporting a causal link between\r\ndefendants' conduct and her race.\r\nCount I fails to assemble \"specific facts adequate to\r\nshow or raise a plausible inference that [Judge] was subjected to\r\nrace-based discrimination.\"  Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 17. \r\nJudge alleges that the officer defendants failed to notify her of\r\nWeems's death because she is black.  But the mere conclusory\r\nassertion that the failure to notify was racially motivated is not\r\nenough.  She further alleges that Dr. Feigin and the officer\r\ndefendants failed to conduct, respectively, a proper autopsy and an\r\nadequate homicide investigation because she is black.  But such\r\nerrors, like the failure to notify, do not by themselves\r\nnecessarily imply racial animus, and the mere conclusory allegation\r\nof such will not suffice.  \r\nThe only factual allegations in the complaint that,\r\nliberally read, might be arguably construed as implying any racial\r\nanimus toward Judge are that Dr. Feigin was rude to Judge and that\r\nOfficer Chevalier was insensitive and \"insinuated\" that Judge\r\nshould know the street names of certain drugs.  But we think these\r\nfall short of indicating that race was a causal factor.  The\r\nrudeness and insensitivity might have resulted from any of a host\r\nof factors, including irritability, defensiveness in the face of\r\ncriticism, dislike for suspected drug users, their friends and\r\nfamilies, or simple arrogance.   \r\nWe have said that the facts alleged must \"specifically\r\nidentify the particular instance(s) of discriminatory treatment\r\nand, as a logical exercise, adequately support the thesis that the\r\ndiscrimination was unlawful.\"  Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 53. \r\nThe allegations concerning the behavior of Dr. Feigin and Officer\r\nChevalier during their conversations with Judge, if true,\r\nundoubtedly evince rude and unprofessional conduct.  But rude and\r\nunprofessional conduct are, unfortunately, all too prevalent in the\r\nworld.  Persons from any racial background may sometimes encounter\r\nit.  That behavior without more   reprehensible as it is    falls\r\nshort of creating a reasonable inference that Judge's race   as\r\nopposed to other factors   was a motivating factor in defendants'\r\nalleged responses subsequent to Weems's death.  Were we to hold\r\notherwise, any unsatisfactory dealings between a public official\r\nand a minority, female or other citizen falling into a protected\r\ncategory would give rise, prima facie, to a potential equal\r\nprotection claim. \r\nWe recognize that it will be the rare case in which a\r\nplaintiff can point to specific racist statements made by\r\ngovernment officials.  Intent to discriminate may be demonstrated\r\nby circumstantial evidence.  See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229,\r\n253 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring).  But the facts alleged still\r\nmust, \"as a logical exercise,\" Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 53,\r\nadequately support the thesis that defendants' omissions were\r\nmotivated, at least in part, by racial animus.  Here, where after-\r\nthe-fact rude behavior and a single \"insinuation\" are not tied to\r\nother allegations of fact that support the thesis that black deaths\r\nand white deaths are treated differently by the police and medical\r\nexaminer in Lowell, that support is lacking.  \r\nThe rule that we accept plaintiff's well-pleaded factual\r\naverments and indulge every reasonable inference hospitable to her\r\ncase \"does not entitle a plaintiff to rest on 'subjective\r\ncharacterizations' or conclusory descriptions of a 'general\r\nscenario which could be dominated by unpleaded facts.'\"  Id. at 53\r\n(quoting Dewey v. Univ. of New Hampshire, 694 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\r\n1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 944 (1983)).  Judge's reliance on the\r\ncase of Kasha Blount, who died in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1990\r\nunder allegedly suspicious circumstances and whose autopsy report\r\nwas apparently prepared by Dr. Feigin, does not cure the lack of\r\nspecificity with regard to improper motive in her complaint.  We\r\nrepeat what we said in Dartmouth Review: \r\n     It is apodictic that evidence of past\r\n     treatment toward others similarly\r\n     situated can be used to demonstrate\r\n     intent in a race discrimination suit. \r\n     To put flesh upon the bare bones of\r\n     this theory, appellants' obligation was\r\n     to identify and relate specific\r\n     instances where persons situated\r\n     similarly 'in all relevant respects'\r\n     were treated differently . . . \r\n\n889 F.2d at 19 (citations omitted).  Blount's death was\r\ninvestigated by the Dorchester Police Department.  There is no\r\nallegation that the Lowell Police Department was involved.  Thus, \r\nwith respect to the officer defendants, the circumstances of the\r\nBlount case are not similar \"in all relevant respects.\"  As to Dr.\r\nFeigin, even assuming he mishandled the Blount case, there is only\r\nthe opinion of Blount's mother, as stated in the press, to suggest\r\nany racial motivation behind Dr. Feigin's alleged failings in the\r\nBlount case. \r\nJudge asks us to view defendants' behavior in the total \r\ncontext of the various alleged omissions on the part of defendants,\r\nincluding their failure to notify Weems's family members and the\r\nallegedly improper investigation and autopsy.  But we do not find\r\nthe totality of circumstances sufficient to make out her\r\nconstitutional claim.  Her allegations boil down to inept, sloppy\r\npolice and coroner performance at the time of Weems's death\r\nfollowed by rude, defensive behavior by the same officials some\r\nweeks later when Weems's family complained.  That combination of\r\ninterrelated, offensive events falls short of raising a reasonable\r\ninference of racial motivation for the acts or omissions alleged. \r\nJudge, in short, has merely \"juxtapos[ed] the fact of\r\none's race,\" Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 19, with conduct which,\r\non its face, may as likely stem from negligence and incompetence as\r\nfrom racial animus.  This is insufficient to state a claim of race-\r\nbased discrimination.  See Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 53\r\n(plaintiff \"may not prevail simply by asserting an inequity and\r\ntacking on the self-serving conclusion that the defendant was\r\nmotivated by discriminatory animus\").  As we stated in Dartmouth\r\nReview: \r\n     Gauzy generalities, unsupported\r\n     conclusions, subjective\r\n     characterizations, and problematic\r\n     suppositions can sprout as easily as\r\n     crabgrass in an imaginative litigant's\r\n     (or lawyer's) word processor. \r\n     Therefore, to avoid tarring defendants'\r\n     reputations unfairly and to prevent\r\n     potential abuses, we have consistently\r\n     required plaintiffs to outline facts\r\n     sufficient to convey specific instances\r\n     of unlawful discrimination. \r\n\n889 F.2d at 16.  See also Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 51 \r\n(deferential reading of complaint does not require that we credit\r\n\"bald assertions, periphrastic circumlocutions, unsubstantiated\r\nconclusions, or outright vituperation\").  \r\nAs Judge's complaint contains no specific factual\r\nallegation which, alone or in combination with other well-pled\r\nfacts, gives rise to a reasonable inference that defendants were\r\nmotivated by anti-black racial animus rather than by other equally\r\nplausible factors at the time of the alleged omissions, we affirm\r\nthe district court's dismissal of Count I of the Third Amended\r\nComplaint. \r\nThe failure of Count I to state a claim is fatal to \r\nCount II.  In Count II, Judge alleges that the City of Lowell\r\nviolated her right to equal protection because it (1) failed to\r\nestablish a custom and policy that prohibited discrimination on the\r\nbasis of race in the discharge of the duties at issue, and (2)\r\nfailed to recruit and train police officers in such a way as to\r\nensure that they would not discriminate on the basis of race in the\r\ndischarge of their duties.      \r\nWe have held that Judge failed sufficiently to allege any\r\nconstitutional injury in Count I of the complaint.  Thus, even if\r\nthe City of Lowell failed to take adequate steps to prohibit\r\ndiscrimination and failed to recruit and train its police officers\r\nso as to ensure that they would not discriminate, there is no\r\nallegation in the complaint sufficient to show that such a policy\r\ncaused harm to the plaintiff Judge who, for reasons already\r\ndiscussed, suffered no constitutional injury.  A section 1983\r\nclaimant cannot recover unless the claimant also proves that the\r\ncustom caused the resulting injury or deprivation of rights.  SeeMonell v. New York City Dep't of Social Serv., 436 U.S. 658, 694\r\n(1977).  Thus, the dismissal of Count II was proper. \r\nThis is not to say that Judge may be left without a\r\nremedy.  Defendants' failure to act upon the information they\r\ndiscovered when they found Weems's body, along with their allegedly\r\nrude and insensitive behavior, could conceivably give rise to\r\nclaims under Massachusetts law.  Weems's wife, and perhaps other\r\nfamily members, may have viable state law claims against defendants\r\narising from the handling of Weems's body, although we offer no\r\nopinion concerning that possibility.  See Soto v. Flores, 103 F.3d\r\n1056, 1072 (1st Cir.) (\"Whether this deplorable scenario is\r\nactionable under Puerto Rican law we leave, as we must, to\r\nothers.\"), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 71 (1997).  Our present holding\r\nis simply that the allegations set forth in the complaint do not\r\nproperly assert violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.\r\nB.  Denial of Judge's Motion to Amend the Complaint\r\nThe district court denied Judge's motion for leave to\r\nfile a Fourth Amended Complaint.  Judge challenges the denial on\r\nappeal.  We review the district court's denial of leave to amend\r\nthe complaint \"for an abuse of discretion, and defer to the\r\ndistrict court if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent on\r\nthe record.\"  Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc., 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\r\nCir. 1995).\r\nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), a litigant\r\nmay amend a pleading once as a matter of right before a responsive\r\npleading is filed and subsequently by the parties' consent or \"by\r\nleave of court.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a).  While \"leave [to amend]\r\nshall be freely given when justice so requires,\" id., \"the liberal\r\namendment policy prescribed by Rule 15(a) does not mean that leave\r\nwill be granted in all cases,\" 6 Charles Alan Wright et al.,\r\nFederal Practice and Procedure  1487, at 611 (2d ed. 1990).  Where\r\nan amendment would be futile or would serve no legitimate purpose,\r\nthe district court \"should not needlessly prolong matters.\" \r\nCorrea-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 59; see also Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S.\r\n178, 182 (1962) (citing \"repeated failure to cure deficiencies by\r\namendments previously allowed\" and \"futility of amendment\" as\r\nproper grounds for denial of leave to amend).\r\nJudge amended her complaint three times prior to\r\ndismissal.  After she filed her Second Amended Complaint, the court\r\nadvised the parties of its doubt that Judge had set forth\r\nsufficient factual allegations to plead an inference of racial\r\nanimus.  Nevertheless, the court allowed Judge to file a Third\r\nAmended Complaint prior to ruling on defendants' then-pending\r\nmotions to dismiss.  In her Third Amended Complaint, Judge added\r\ntwo defendants.  Judge also added several new paragraphs to the\r\ncomplaint that expanded on her allegation that the defendants had\r\nviolated various duties owed to her and that these breaches\r\nconstituted a \"pattern or practice\" of discrimination.  As to the\r\nlatter, Judge appended to the complaint newspaper articles\r\nconcerning the Kasha Blount case.  None of these amendments,\r\nhowever, added any non-conclusory factual allegations to support\r\nthe conclusion that defendants' alleged omissions were motivated by\r\nracial animus.  The district court dismissed the Third Amended\r\nComplaint, and we have concluded that it properly did so.\r\nJudge sought leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint. \r\nThe district court denied Judge's motion without comment.  The only\r\ndifference between the Third Amended Complaint and the proposed\r\nFourth Amended Complaint was the addition of a new paragraph that\r\nidentified two reported cases from the  Massachusetts Court of\r\nAppeals in which the victims, allegedly white, died under\r\ncircumstances alleged to be similar to those of Weems.  Judge\r\nalleged that these victims' cases resulted in a full investigation\r\nand prosecution because the victims, unlike Weems, were white.\r\nThese new allegations failed to cure the fundamental\r\ndefect in Judge's complaint.  The two reported decisions identified\r\nby Judge do not indicate which, if any, of the officer defendants\r\nwere involved in the investigations.  Nor do the opinions identify\r\nDr. Feigin as the medical examiner in either case.  Even assuming\r\nthat the \"suspicious circumstances\" in the two reported cases were\r\nnearly identical to those in the present case, there is nothing in\r\nthe reported opinions that remotely suggests that the performances\r\nof the government officials in those cases were motivated by the\r\nvictims' race.  The allegations involving these decisions do not\r\nsupply the missing causal link between defendants' alleged\r\nomissions in this case and Judge's race.  Even accepting the\r\nproposed amendments, Judge has alleged only that in one case (the\r\nBlount case in Dorchester) the officials acted improperly, while in\r\ntwo other cases the officials acted properly.  Without more, she\r\nthen attributes the officials' acts and omissions to the race of\r\nthe victim-decedents.  This inference is no more than a \"general\r\nscenario which could be dominated by unpleaded facts.\"  Dewey v.\r\nUniv. of New Hampshire, 694 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1982), cert.denied, 461 U.S. 944 (1983).  Moreover, it is a scenario that\r\nencompasses only one case of allegedly improper conduct compared\r\nwith two cases of allegedly proper conduct.  \"[T]he mere existence\r\nof disparate treatment   even widely disparate treatment   does not\r\nfurnish adequate basis for an inference that the discrimination was\r\nracially motivated.\"  Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 20.      \r\nThe amendment proffered by Judge failed to cure the\r\ndeficiency identified by the court in its examination of the Third\r\nAmended Complaint.  Granting the proposed amendment would have been\r\nfutile.  Under these circumstances, we conclude that the court did\r\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Judge leave to file the Fourth\r\nAmended Complaint.\r\nAffirmed.  Each party to bear its own costs.            \r\n",

Defendants moved to dismiss the section\r\n1983 claims in Judge's Third Amended Complaint pursuant to Fed. R.\r\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to set forth a claim for relief.  The\r\ncourt granted defendants' motions to dismiss the section 1983\r\nclaims and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the\r\nremaining state law claims.  Judge appeals from the order granting\r\ndefendants' motions to dismiss.  We affirm. \r\n                    I.  BACKGROUND \r\nWe summarize the facts and allegations set forth in the\r\nThird Amended Complaint.  Judge, who is black, is the sister of\r\nGary Weems, who died on November 6, 1993.  Weems was also black. \r\nOn the date of Weems's death, both Judge and Weems resided at 7\r\nWalter Terrace in Somerville, Massachusetts.  Weems married Denise\r\nRichardson Weems in 1980, but they had been separated for several\r\nyears at the time of Weems's death. \r\nThe Lowell Police Department discovered Weems's body on\r\nor about November 6, 1993.  At that time, Weems had on his person\r\nvarious forms of identification that indicated that he lived at 7\r\nWalter Terrace.  He also had a bank passbook indicating that he and\r\nJudge jointly held a savings account.  Notwithstanding the\r\ndiscovery of these items, the Lowell Police Department did not\r\ncontact Judge or any other member of Weems's family to inform them\r\nof Weems's death.  As a result, Judge did not learn of her\r\nbrother's death until approximately six weeks after it occurred. \r\nIn the interim, Weems was buried in Lowell as an \"unknown person.\"\r\nAfter the Lowell Police Department discovered Weems's\r\nbody, it conducted a homicide investigation.  Police officers took\r\nwitness statements from three individuals.  Those statements\r\nindicated that Weems may have died as a result of an injection of\r\nnarcotics administered by another person.  In their statements, the\r\nwitnesses contradicted one another as to the identity of the person\r\nor persons who administered the injection.  The witnesses also\r\nindicated that (1) Weems had received over $90 in cash around 4:00\r\np.m. on November 5, 1993, but had no cash on his person when his\r\nbody was discovered the next day, and (2) at some point during the\r\nnight of November 5, 1993, Weems's pockets were turned inside out. \r\nNotwithstanding this evidence, the officers did not investigate\r\nWeems's death further.  The officers did not interview additional\r\npersons who may have been present at the time of Weems's death. \r\nThey did not seek out and interview any of Weems's family members. \r\nJudge learned of Weems's death sometime in December,\r\n1993.  Shortly after learning that Weems had died, Judge, along\r\nwith Denise Weems and Jestina Richardson, Denise Weems's mother\r\n(both of whom are also black), went to the office of Gerald Feigin,\r\nthe Medical Examiner who had performed an autopsy on Weems's body. \r\nInitially, Dr. Feigin resisted meeting with the women.  After Dr.\r\nFeigin agreed to meet with them, Judge asked Feigin to show the\r\nwomen something to demonstrate that the body that had been buried\r\napproximately six weeks earlier was that of Gary Weems.  Dr. Feigin\r\n\"reacted angrily and shoved a photograph of the dead man so far\r\ninto Ms. Judge's face that she could not see it.\"  (Third Amended\r\nComplaint,  22.)  When Judge requested further information\r\nconcerning the circumstances of Weems's death, Dr. Feigin \"started\r\nyelling at the three women that he had showed [sic] them the\r\nphotograph, that the photograph should be good enough for them and\r\nthat he did not have time 'for this.'\"  See id.  \r\nJudge alleges on information and belief that at the time\r\nDr. Feigin prepared his autopsy report concerning Weems, he was\r\naware of the \"suspicious circumstances\" discovered by the police,\r\nyet failed to include this information in his report.  Dr. Feigin\r\ndid not make any recommendation to the district attorney's office\r\nthat Weems's death be further investigated.   \r\nJudge, Denise Weems and Ms. Richardson also visited the\r\nLowell Police Department.  The women spoke to an officer, believed\r\nto be Officer Chavalier, who, during their conversation, used the\r\nstreet names of certain drugs.  When Judge indicated that she did\r\nnot understand what the officer was referring to, \"the officer\r\nresponded in a manner which insinuated that because she was Black,\r\nshe must know what he was referring to, and her claim that she did\r\nnot know was disingenuous.\"  When Judge asked the officer whether\r\nthe police had found any forms of identification on Weems's person,\r\nthe officer replied that they had not.  When Judge asked for the\r\nreturn of Weems's personal belongings, the officer stated that the\r\nonly item found on Weems's person was a knife.  In response to\r\nquestions concerning the circumstances of Weems's death, the\r\nofficer \"provided misleading and incomplete information.\"   \r\nIn her Third Amended Complaint, Judge asserted four\r\nclaims for relief.  In Count I, brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \r\n1983, she alleged that the officer defendants and Dr. Feigin\r\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \r\nJudge alleged that Dr. Feigin and the officer defendants \"violated\r\ntheir constitutional duty by discriminating against Rebecca Judge\r\non the basis of her race and the race of her deceased brother Gary\r\nWeems and his wife Denise Weems,\" in that they failed to: (1)\r\nnotify Weems's wife and next of kin of Weems's death; (2) deliver\r\nin a timely fashion to Weems's wife and next of kin Weems's\r\npersonal belongings; (3) carefully inquire into the cause and\r\ncircumstances of Gary Weems's death; (4) respect the right of Gary\r\nWeems's wife and next of kin to dispose of his body as they wished;\r\n(5) respond truthfully to requests for information regarding Gary\r\nWeems's death made by members of Gary Weems's family;\r\n(6)investigate the circumstances of Gary Weems's death with due\r\nregard to the possibility that the death may have resulted from\r\ncriminal acts; (7) pursue carefully evidence of suspicious\r\ncircumstances regarding Gary Weems's death; and (8) notify the\r\ndistrict attorney's office of evidence warranting the attention of\r\nthat office.  \r\nJudge alleged \"on information and belief\" that the above\r\nconduct \"would not have been characterized by the gross\r\ndeficiencies with which it was characterized had [she], her\r\ndeceased brother Gary Weems and his wife Denise Weems been White,\r\ninstead of Black.\"  Judge further alleged that these circumstances \r\n     were part and parcel of a pattern and\r\n     practice, pursuant to which one level\r\n     of care is used by defendants in the\r\n     investigation of the deaths of White\r\n     persons, and another, inferior level of\r\n     care is used by defendants in the\r\n     investigation of the death of Black\r\n     persons, particularly if the Black\r\n     persons in question are ostensibly of a\r\n     low economic class and the cause of\r\n     death is ostensibly a drug overdose. \r\n\nId.,  33.  As support for this \"pattern and practice\" allegation,\r\nJudge cited the case of Kasha Blount, a black woman from Dorcester,\r\nMassachusetts, who died in February 1990 under allegedly suspicious\r\ncircumstances.  According to newspaper articles appended to the\r\nThird Amended Complaint, a man was tried in the Blount case on\r\nhomicide charges, but was acquitted by a jury.  The articles\r\nindicate that Dr. Feigin was the medical examiner in the Blount\r\ncase.  Relying upon statements made by Blount's mother to the\r\npress, Judge alleges that Dr. Feigin failed to properly investigate\r\nMs. Blount's death because she was black.\r\nIn Count II, Judge alleged that the City of Lowell had\r\nexhibited \"deliberate indifference\" by failing to \"establish a\r\ncustom and policy that prohibited discrimination on the basis of\r\nrace in the discharge of the legal obligations at issue,\" and by\r\nfailing to recruit and train its police officers \"in such a way as\r\nto ensure that they would not discriminate on the basis of race in\r\nthe discharge of the legal obligations at issue.\"  In Counts III\r\nand IV, Judge alleged state law claims for intentional infliction\r\nof emotional distress against Dr. Feigin and Officer Chevalier.\r\nAfter Judge filed her initial complaint, she amended it\r\nthree times.  The defendants filed motions to dismiss the Second\r\nAmended Complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure\r\nto state a claim for relief under section 1983.  At a scheduling\r\nconference held after those motions were filed, the court expressed\r\nskepticism that the Second Amended Complaint set forth sufficient\r\nfactual support for Judge's allegation of racial animus. \r\nNevertheless, the court denied the motions to dismiss without\r\nprejudice to their being renewed at a later date.  Judge filed a\r\nThird Amended Complaint, in which she elaborated on the specific\r\nalleged omissions of the defendant officers and Dr. Feigin, and\r\ncited the Blount case.  The defendants renewed their motions to\r\ndismiss for failure to state a claim, and the court granted the \r\nmotions.  The court denied Judge's motion to reconsider and her\r\nmotion for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint.  Having\r\ndismissed the federal claims set forth in Counts I and II, the\r\ncourt declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the two\r\nremaining state law causes of action (Counts III and IV) and\r\ndismissed them as well.  \r\n                   II.  DISCUSSION   \r\nJudge argues on appeal that the district court erred in\r\ndismissing her Third Amended Complaint.  We conclude that the\r\ndistrict court properly dismissed Counts I and II of Judge's Third\r\nAmended Complaint and, having done so, properly dismissed the\r\nremaining state law claims.  Judge also challenges the denial of\r\nher motion for leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint.  We\r\nconclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying\r\nthat motion.  \r\nA.  Dismissal of the Third Amended Complaint\r\nWe review the disposition of a motion to dismiss de novo. \r\nSee LaChapelle v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197923\"><a href=\"/opinion/197923/lachapelle-v-berkshire-life/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 509 (1st\r\nCir. 1998).  Rule 8(a) provides that the complaint must contain \"a\r\nshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is\r\nentitled to relief.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a).  In an oft-quoted \r\ngloss, the Supreme Court stated over forty years ago that a\r\ncomplaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim\r\n\"unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set\r\nof facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to\r\nrelief.\"  Conley v.

Put another\r\nway, the element of illegal motive must be pleaded by alleging \r\nspecific non-conclusory facts from which such a motive may\r\nreasonably be inferred, not merely by generalized asseveration\r\nalone.  See Correa-Martinez v. Arillaga-Belendez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541732\"><a href=\"/opinion/541732/jorge-correa-martinez-v-rene-arrillaga-belendez/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51\r\n(1st Cir. 1990) (requiring that alleged facts in complaint\r\n\"specifically identify the particular instance(s) of discriminatory\r\ntreatment and, as a logical exercise, adequately support the thesis\r\nthat the discrimination was unlawful\").\r\nThe above-mentioned cases in this circuit predate the\r\nSupreme Court's decision in Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics\r\nIntelligence and Coordination Unit, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112825\"><a href=\"/opinion/112825/leatherman-v-tarrant-county-narcotics-intelligence-and-coordination-unit/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993), as well as\r\nthe Court's very recent decision in Crawford-El v. Britton, 118 S.\r\nCt. 1584 (1998).  As the district court relied upon the earlier\r\nFirst Circuit caselaw in determining that the Third Amended\r\nComplaint was legally inadequate, we must decide whether the\r\nrequirement stated in those cases survives Leatherman and Crawford-\r\nEl.  Based particularly on the Court's dicta in Crawford-El, infra, \r\nwe believe that it does, at least in a case like the present\r\nalleging a constitutional violation calling for proof of an illegal\r\nmotive.  We also believe, contrary to Judge's contentions, that the\r\ndistrict court did not err in its manner of applying our precedents\r\nto the Third Amended Complaint.\r\nWere Leatherman the Supreme Court's last and only word,\r\nwe would be less certain of the correctness of our refusal, in\r\ncircumstances like the present, to accept purely conclusory\r\npleading on the element of discriminatory intent.  In Leatherman,\r\nthe Court rejected a heightened pleading standard imposed by the\r\nFifth Circuit in cases alleging municipal liability under section\r\n1983.  The case arose out of complaints filed against two\r\nmunicipalities for their officers' forcible entry into residences\r\nthe officers suspected were fronts for drug-manufacturing\r\noperations.  The district court and the Fifth Circuit, both\r\napplying the latter's heightened pleading standard in civil rights\r\ncases, held that the complaints should be dismissed.  The Supreme\r\nCourt reversed.\r\nThe Court found it \"impossible to square the 'heightened\r\npleading standard' applied by the Fifth Circuit . . . with the\r\nliberal system of 'notice pleading' set up by the Federal Rules.\" \r\nLeatherman, 507 U.S. at 168.  The defendants in Leatherman argued\r\nthat a heightened pleading requirement was necessary because \"a\r\nmore relaxed pleading requirement would subject municipalities to\r\nexpensive and time consuming discovery in every  1983 case,\r\neviscerating their immunity from suit and disrupting municipal\r\nfunctions.\"  Id.  The Supreme Court observed, however, that \"unlike\r\nvarious government officials, municipalities do not enjoy immunity\r\nfrom suit   either absolute or qualified,\" id., suggesting the\r\nresult might be different in individual capacity actions against\r\ngovernment officials.  The Court specifically reserved judgment on\r\nthe question whether its \"qualified immunity jurisprudence would\r\nrequire a heightened pleading in cases involving individual\r\ngovernment officials.\"  Id. \r\n Judge argues that in Crawford-El, the Court answered\r\nthat question in the negative.  We are not so sure, but, in any\r\ncase, immunity was not (as the Supreme Court pointed out) the key\r\nissue there, any more than it was here.  In Crawford-El, the\r\nSupreme Court rejected the D.C. Circuit's requirement that a\r\nplaintiff bringing a claim under section 1983 against a government\r\nofficial in his or her individual capacity, regarding which the\r\nofficial's improper motive is a necessary element, adduce \"clear\r\nand convincing evidence\" of such motive in order to defeat a motion\r\nfor summary judgment.  118 S. Ct. at 1595.  The Court of Appeals\r\nhad adopted this heightened evidentiary requirement to protect\r\ngovernment officials, in a doubtful case, from the burdens of\r\ndiscovery and trial.  The Supreme Court held that the D.C. Circuit\r\nwent too far in increasing the plaintiff's evidentiary burden.  \r\nThe Court continued, however, with strong dicta dealing squarely\r\nwith the issue now before us.  Indicating awareness and some\r\nsympathy with \"the potential problem that troubled the court,\" the\r\nSupreme Court said that it was \"therefore appropriate to add a few\r\nwords on some of the existing procedures available to federal trial\r\njudges in handling claims that involve examination of an official's\r\nstate of mind.\"   Id. at 1596.  The Court stated that\r\n[w]hen a plaintiff files a complaint against a\r\npublic official alleging a claim that requires\r\nproof of wrongful motive, the trial court must\r\nexercise its discretion in a way that protects\r\nthe substance of the qualified immunity\r\ndefense.  It must exercise its  discretion so\r\nthat officials are not subjected to\r\nunnecessary and burdensome discovery or trial\r\nproceedings. \r\n\nId.  \r\nOne way of accomplishing this, the Court went on, was for \r\ntrial courts, prior to permitting any discovery, to use existing\r\nprocedures, such as ordering a plaintiff to reply to a defendant's\r\nanswer or granting defendant's motion for a more definite\r\nstatement, to require that plaintiffs allege specific facts\r\nsupporting an allegation of wrongful motive.  Id. at 1596.  The\r\nSupreme Court then stated, in unequivocal language directly\r\nrelevant to the issue under consideration, that \"the [trial] court\r\nmay insist that the plaintiff 'put forward specific, nonconclusory\r\nfactual allegations' that establish improper motive causing\r\ncognizable injury in order to survive a prediscovery motion for\r\ndismissal or summary judgment.\"  Id. (quoting in part Siegert v.\r\nGilley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112594\"><a href=\"/opinion/112594/siegert-v-gilley/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 236 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in\r\njudgment)).  \"This option exists,\" the Court went on to state,\r\n\"even if the official chooses not to plead the affirmative defense\r\nof qualified immunity.\"  Id. at 1597.    \r\nJudge's Count I section 1983 claim rests upon \r\nallegations of unconstitutional motive (i.e., intent to\r\ndiscriminate because of race) on the part of several defendants\r\nsued in their individual capacities.  See infra.  In Crawford-El,\r\nthe Supreme Court recognized that claims against individual public\r\nofficials have the potential to subject them to burdensome\r\ndiscovery and trials and stated that district judges may dispose of\r\nsuch claims prior to permitting any discovery where a plaintiff,\r\nhaving been provided the opportunity to do so, fails to allege\r\n\"specific, nonconclusory factual allegations that establish \r\nimproper motive.\"  118 S. Ct at 1596 (emphasis provided).  We\r\nconclude, therefore, that the five Justices writing for the Court\r\nin Crawford-El permitted an approach similar to ours in Dartmouth\r\nReview and Correa-Martinez, calling for the pleading of specific\r\nfacts from which to infer illegal motive   although the Court\r\nlimited its carefully-phrased endorsement of that approach to\r\nconstitutional claims in which \"improper motive\" was an essential\r\nelement for plaintiff to prove.  See Crawford-El, 118 S. Ct. at\r\n1596.  As Count I here precisely involves an action under section\r\n1983 against state officials in their individual capacities\r\nrequiring plaintiff to prove improper motive, see infra, we regard\r\nthe majority's carefully-fashioned dicta in Crawford-El as allowing\r\nthe continued use here of the standard reflected in this circuit's\r\nprevious caselaw and applied below. \r\nWe therefore examine Count I of Judge's Third Amended\r\nComplaint to determine whether it meets the standard permitted in\r\nCrawford-El (\"specific, nonconclusory factual allegations that\r\nestablish that defendant acted based upon an improper motive\"), a\r\nstandard, as we say, similar to that articulated by this circuit in\r\nDartmouth Review and progeny.  In so applying that standard, we\r\nbear in mind that, in Count I, Judge alleged that the federal right\r\nshe was denied was the right to equal protection of the laws under\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment.  One who asserts that governmental action\r\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause must show that he or she is\r\n\"the victim of intentional discrimination.\"  Texas Dept. of\r\nCommunity Affairs v.

See Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at\r\n16.    \r\nJudge alleges in Count I that the defendants failed to\r\ncarry out various duties in connection with the discovery of\r\nWeems's body and the investigation of Weems's death.  First, Judge\r\nalleges that the defendants failed to notify her of Weems's death\r\nin a timely manner, which caused her brother to be buried as an\r\n\"unknown person.\"While the defendants each moved to dismiss the complaint\r\nfor lack of standing based upon the absence of any right under\r\nstate law for Judge to possess Weems's body, counsel for Judge\r\nmade clear during oral argument on the motions to dismiss that\r\nJudge's claims were not grounded upon any such interest:\r\n\n     Court:  But the whole theory of your case is that\r\n     the plaintiff was not, or members of the family,\r\n     were not told of the deceased passing, and he was\r\n     buried.  Isn't that the gravamen of the case?\r\n\n     Mr. Fine (Counsel for Judge):  No. \r\n\nSecond, Judge alleges that the government\r\nofficials   the officer defendants and Dr. Feigin   failed,\r\nrespectively, to conduct an adequate homicide investigation and\r\nprepare a proper  autopsy report, despite the existence of\r\n\"suspicious circumstances.\"  Third, Judge alleges that defendants\r\nwere rude to her when she sought information concerning Weems's\r\ndeath.  Judge alleges that all of these omissions occurred because\r\nshe is black.  In sum, Judge alleges a double standard whereby\r\ndeaths of black persons that occur under suspicious circumstances\r\nare treated differently (i.e., less seriously) than deaths of white\r\npersons under similar circumstances, and that the families of the\r\nblack decedents are injured by this disparate treatment.  \r\nAssociated with the above, Judge made several other more\r\nspecific assertions:  First, that when Judge confronted Dr. Feigin\r\nand Officer Chevalier approximately six weeks after Weems's death,\r\nthey failed to provide her basic and accurate information\r\nconcerning the circumstances of Weems's death and engaged in rude,\r\ninsulting and unprofessional behavior.  Second, Judge alleges that\r\nOfficer Chevalier \"insinuated\" that she knew the street names for\r\ncertain drugs.  Third, Judge alleges that her allegation of\r\ndisparate treatment based on race is supported by the facts of the\r\nKasha Blount case, a state court proceeding reported in the\r\nnewspaper which involved a black teenager who died in Dorchester\r\nunder suspicious circumstances and an allegedly mishandled autopsy\r\nperformed by Dr. Feigin.  Neither separately nor taken with the\r\nothers, however, do these alleged facts give rise, by themselves,\r\nto a reasonable inference that defendants were motivated by racial\r\nconsiderations.             \r\nState actors will, of course, violate the Equal\r\nProtection Clause if they deliberately and selectively deny\r\nprotective services to the members of a disfavored minority.  SeeDeShaney v. Winnebago County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112202\"><a href=\"/opinion/112202/deshaney-v-winnebago-county-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197 n.3 (1989).  But,\r\nas we said in Dartmouth Review, \"merely juxtaposing the fact of\r\none's race with an instance of discrimination is insufficient to\r\nstate a claim.\"  Id. at 19.  In Dartmouth Review, white student\r\neditors of an off-campus newspaper who were suspended following a\r\nconfrontation with a black professor brought a civil rights action\r\nagainst the college and various college officials, alleging that\r\ntheir suspension was racially motivated.  The district court\r\ndismissed their complaint for failure to state a claim.  We\r\naffirmed, holding that \"[a]bsent some meaningful, fact-specific\r\nallegation of a causal link between defendant's conduct and\r\nplaintiff's race, the complaint's first count cannot stand.\"  Id. \r\nThus, to survive a motion to dismiss Count I, Judge must set forth\r\nspecific factual allegations supporting a causal link between\r\ndefendants' conduct and her race.\r\nCount I fails to assemble \"specific facts adequate to\r\nshow or raise a plausible inference that [Judge] was subjected to\r\nrace-based discrimination.\"  Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 17. \r\nJudge alleges that the officer defendants failed to notify her of\r\nWeems's death because she is black.  But the mere conclusory\r\nassertion that the failure to notify was racially motivated is not\r\nenough.  She further alleges that Dr. Feigin and the officer\r\ndefendants failed to conduct, respectively, a proper autopsy and an\r\nadequate homicide investigation because she is black.  But such\r\nerrors, like the failure to notify, do not by themselves\r\nnecessarily imply racial animus, and the mere conclusory allegation\r\nof such will not suffice.  \r\nThe only factual allegations in the complaint that,\r\nliberally read, might be arguably construed as implying any racial\r\nanimus toward Judge are that Dr. Feigin was rude to Judge and that\r\nOfficer Chevalier was insensitive and \"insinuated\" that Judge\r\nshould know the street names of certain drugs.  But we think these\r\nfall short of indicating that race was a causal factor.  The\r\nrudeness and insensitivity might have resulted from any of a host\r\nof factors, including irritability, defensiveness in the face of\r\ncriticism, dislike for suspected drug users, their friends and\r\nfamilies, or simple arrogance.   \r\nWe have said that the facts alleged must \"specifically\r\nidentify the particular instance(s) of discriminatory treatment\r\nand, as a logical exercise, adequately support the thesis that the\r\ndiscrimination was unlawful.\"  Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 53. \r\nThe allegations concerning the behavior of Dr. Feigin and Officer\r\nChevalier during their conversations with Judge, if true,\r\nundoubtedly evince rude and unprofessional conduct.  But rude and\r\nunprofessional conduct are, unfortunately, all too prevalent in the\r\nworld.  Persons from any racial background may sometimes encounter\r\nit.  That behavior without more   reprehensible as it is    falls\r\nshort of creating a reasonable inference that Judge's race   as\r\nopposed to other factors   was a motivating factor in defendants'\r\nalleged responses subsequent to Weems's death.  Were we to hold\r\notherwise, any unsatisfactory dealings between a public official\r\nand a minority, female or other citizen falling into a protected\r\ncategory would give rise, prima facie, to a potential equal\r\nprotection claim. \r\nWe recognize that it will be the rare case in which a\r\nplaintiff can point to specific racist statements made by\r\ngovernment officials.  Intent to discriminate may be demonstrated\r\nby circumstantial evidence.  See Washington v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n253 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring).  But the facts alleged still\r\nmust, \"as a logical exercise,\" Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 53,\r\nadequately support the thesis that defendants' omissions were\r\nmotivated, at least in part, by racial animus.  Here, where after-\r\nthe-fact rude behavior and a single \"insinuation\" are not tied to\r\nother allegations of fact that support the thesis that black deaths\r\nand white deaths are treated differently by the police and medical\r\nexaminer in Lowell, that support is lacking.  \r\nThe rule that we accept plaintiff's well-pleaded factual\r\naverments and indulge every reasonable inference hospitable to her\r\ncase \"does not entitle a plaintiff to rest on 'subjective\r\ncharacterizations' or conclusory descriptions of a 'general\r\nscenario which could be dominated by unpleaded facts.'\"  Id. at 53\r\n(quoting Dewey v. Univ. of New Hampshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411302\"><a href=\"/opinion/411302/richard-dewey-v-the-university-of-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir.\r\n1982), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983)).  Judge's reliance on the\r\ncase of Kasha Blount, who died in Dorchester, Massachusetts in 1990\r\nunder allegedly suspicious circumstances and whose autopsy report\r\nwas apparently prepared by Dr. Feigin, does not cure the lack of\r\nspecificity with regard to improper motive in her complaint.  We\r\nrepeat what we said in Dartmouth Review: \r\n     It is apodictic that evidence of past\r\n     treatment toward others similarly\r\n     situated can be used to demonstrate\r\n     intent in a race discrimination suit. \r\n     To put flesh upon the bare bones of\r\n     this theory, appellants' obligation was\r\n     to identify and relate specific\r\n     instances where persons situated\r\n     similarly 'in all relevant respects'\r\n     were treated differently . . . \r\n\n889 F.2d at 19 (citations omitted).  Blount's death was\r\ninvestigated by the Dorchester Police Department.  There is no\r\nallegation that the Lowell Police Department was involved.  Thus, \r\nwith respect to the officer defendants, the circumstances of the\r\nBlount case are not similar \"in all relevant respects.\"  As to Dr.\r\nFeigin, even assuming he mishandled the Blount case, there is only\r\nthe opinion of Blount's mother, as stated in the press, to suggest\r\nany racial motivation behind Dr. Feigin's alleged failings in the\r\nBlount case. \r\nJudge asks us to view defendants' behavior in the total \r\ncontext of the various alleged omissions on the part of defendants,\r\nincluding their failure to notify Weems's family members and the\r\nallegedly improper investigation and autopsy.  But we do not find\r\nthe totality of circumstances sufficient to make out her\r\nconstitutional claim.  Her allegations boil down to inept, sloppy\r\npolice and coroner performance at the time of Weems's death\r\nfollowed by rude, defensive behavior by the same officials some\r\nweeks later when Weems's family complained.  That combination of\r\ninterrelated, offensive events falls short of raising a reasonable\r\ninference of racial motivation for the acts or omissions alleged. \r\nJudge, in short, has merely \"juxtapos[ed] the fact of\r\none's race,\" Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 19, with conduct which,\r\non its face, may as likely stem from negligence and incompetence as\r\nfrom racial animus.  This is insufficient to state a claim of race-\r\nbased discrimination.  See Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 53\r\n(plaintiff \"may not prevail simply by asserting an inequity and\r\ntacking on the self-serving conclusion that the defendant was\r\nmotivated by discriminatory animus\").  As we stated in Dartmouth\r\nReview: \r\n     Gauzy generalities, unsupported\r\n     conclusions, subjective\r\n     characterizations, and problematic\r\n     suppositions can sprout as easily as\r\n     crabgrass in an imaginative litigant's\r\n     (or lawyer's) word processor. \r\n     Therefore, to avoid tarring defendants'\r\n     reputations unfairly and to prevent\r\n     potential abuses, we have consistently\r\n     required plaintiffs to outline facts\r\n     sufficient to convey specific instances\r\n     of unlawful discrimination. \r\n\n889 F.2d at 16.  See also Correa-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 51 \r\n(deferential reading of complaint does not require that we credit\r\n\"bald assertions, periphrastic circumlocutions, unsubstantiated\r\nconclusions, or outright vituperation\").  \r\nAs Judge's complaint contains no specific factual\r\nallegation which, alone or in combination with other well-pled\r\nfacts, gives rise to a reasonable inference that defendants were\r\nmotivated by anti-black racial animus rather than by other equally\r\nplausible factors at the time of the alleged omissions, we affirm\r\nthe district court's dismissal of Count I of the Third Amended\r\nComplaint. \r\nThe failure of Count I to state a claim is fatal to \r\nCount II.  In Count II, Judge alleges that the City of Lowell\r\nviolated her right to equal protection because it (1) failed to\r\nestablish a custom and policy that prohibited discrimination on the\r\nbasis of race in the discharge of the duties at issue, and (2)\r\nfailed to recruit and train police officers in such a way as to\r\nensure that they would not discriminate on the basis of race in the\r\ndischarge of their duties.      \r\nWe have held that Judge failed sufficiently to allege any\r\nconstitutional injury in Count I of the complaint.  Thus, even if\r\nthe City of Lowell failed to take adequate steps to prohibit\r\ndiscrimination and failed to recruit and train its police officers\r\nso as to ensure that they would not discriminate, there is no\r\nallegation in the complaint sufficient to show that such a policy\r\ncaused harm to the plaintiff Judge who, for reasons already\r\ndiscussed, suffered no constitutional injury.  A section 1983\r\nclaimant cannot recover unless the claimant also proves that the\r\ncustom caused the resulting injury or deprivation of rights.  SeeMonell v.

Thus, the dismissal of Count II was proper. \r\nThis is not to say that Judge may be left without a\r\nremedy.  Defendants' failure to act upon the information they\r\ndiscovered when they found Weems's body, along with their allegedly\r\nrude and insensitive behavior, could conceivably give rise to\r\nclaims under Massachusetts law.  Weems's wife, and perhaps other\r\nfamily members, may have viable state law claims against defendants\r\narising from the handling of Weems's body, although we offer no\r\nopinion concerning that possibility.

While \"leave [to amend]\r\nshall be freely given when justice so requires,\" id., \"the liberal\r\namendment policy prescribed by Rule 15(a) does not mean that leave\r\nwill be granted in all cases,\" 6 Charles Alan Wright et al.,\r\nFederal Practice and Procedure  1487, at 611 (2d ed. 1990).  Where\r\nan amendment would be futile or would serve no legitimate purpose,\r\nthe district court \"should not needlessly prolong matters.\" \r\nCorrea-Martinez, 903 F.2d at 59; see also Foman v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106497\"><a href=\"/opinion/106497/foman-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">178</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 182 (1962) (citing \"repeated failure to cure deficiencies by\r\namendments previously allowed\" and \"futility of amendment\" as\r\nproper grounds for denial of leave to amend).\r\nJudge amended her complaint three times prior to\r\ndismissal.  After she filed her Second Amended Complaint, the court\r\nadvised the parties of its doubt that Judge had set forth\r\nsufficient factual allegations to plead an inference of racial\r\nanimus.  Nevertheless, the court allowed Judge to file a Third\r\nAmended Complaint prior to ruling on defendants' then-pending\r\nmotions to dismiss.  In her Third Amended Complaint, Judge added\r\ntwo defendants.  Judge also added several new paragraphs to the\r\ncomplaint that expanded on her allegation that the defendants had\r\nviolated various duties owed to her and that these breaches\r\nconstituted a \"pattern or practice\" of discrimination.  As to the\r\nlatter, Judge appended to the complaint newspaper articles\r\nconcerning the Kasha Blount case.  None of these amendments,\r\nhowever, added any non-conclusory factual allegations to support\r\nthe conclusion that defendants' alleged omissions were motivated by\r\nracial animus.  The district court dismissed the Third Amended\r\nComplaint, and we have concluded that it properly did so.\r\nJudge sought leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint. \r\nThe district court denied Judge's motion without comment.  The only\r\ndifference between the Third Amended Complaint and the proposed\r\nFourth Amended Complaint was the addition of a new paragraph that\r\nidentified two reported cases from the  Massachusetts Court of\r\nAppeals in which the victims, allegedly white, died under\r\ncircumstances alleged to be similar to those of Weems.  Judge\r\nalleged that these victims' cases resulted in a full investigation\r\nand prosecution because the victims, unlike Weems, were white.\r\nThese new allegations failed to cure the fundamental\r\ndefect in Judge's complaint.  The two reported decisions identified\r\nby Judge do not indicate which, if any, of the officer defendants\r\nwere involved in the investigations.  Nor do the opinions identify\r\nDr. Feigin as the medical examiner in either case.  Even assuming\r\nthat the \"suspicious circumstances\" in the two reported cases were\r\nnearly identical to those in the present case, there is nothing in\r\nthe reported opinions that remotely suggests that the performances\r\nof the government officials in those cases were motivated by the\r\nvictims' race.  The allegations involving these decisions do not\r\nsupply the missing causal link between defendants' alleged\r\nomissions in this case and Judge's race.  Even accepting the\r\nproposed amendments, Judge has alleged only that in one case (the\r\nBlount case in Dorchester) the officials acted improperly, while in\r\ntwo other cases the officials acted properly.  Without more, she\r\nthen attributes the officials' acts and omissions to the race of\r\nthe victim-decedents.  This inference is no more than a \"general\r\nscenario which could be dominated by unpleaded facts.\"  Dewey v.\r\nUniv. of New Hampshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"411302\"><a href=\"/opinion/411302/richard-dewey-v-the-university-of-new-hampshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 1982), cert.denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983).  Moreover, it is a scenario that\r\nencompasses only one case of allegedly improper conduct compared\r\nwith two cases of allegedly proper conduct.  \"[T]he mere existence\r\nof disparate treatment   even widely disparate treatment   does not\r\nfurnish adequate basis for an inference that the discrimination was\r\nracially motivated.\"  Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 20.      \r\nThe amendment proffered by Judge failed to cure the\r\ndeficiency identified by the court in its examination of the Third\r\nAmended Complaint.  Granting the proposed amendment would have been\r\nfutile.  Under these circumstances, we conclude that the court did\r\nnot abuse its discretion in denying Judge leave to file the Fourth\r\nAmended Complaint.\r\nAffirmed.  Each party to bear its own costs.            \r\n</pre>",
