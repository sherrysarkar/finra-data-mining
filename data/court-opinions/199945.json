Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n    Julian Ferreira-Plasencia on brief pro se.\n    James Moretti on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                            May 2, 2002\n\f           Per Curiam.     Julian Ferreira-Plasencia, proceeding\n\npro se, appeals from the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nto defendants John H. Ruginski, Jr. and Chris Martinez in this\n\ndiversity-based legal malpractice suit. Below, the plaintiff\n\nclaimed that the defendants, his former attorney and the attorney's\n\nlegal assistant, failed to file a timely notice of appeal from an\n\nImmigration Judge’s denial of his application for a waiver of\n\ndeportability. He further contended that the defendants did not\n\nadvise him as to alternative methods to seek relief from\n\ndeportation. Subsequent to the dismissal of his untimely appeal,\n\nFerreira-Plasencia was deported. At some time thereafter, he re-\n\nentered the country, and was later convicted for illegal re-entry,\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1326.\n\n           The district court adopted a magistrate judge’s report\n\nand recommendation and granted summary judgment to the defendants\n\nbecause Ferreira-Plasencia offered no evidence to establish that\n\nthe defendants’ failure to file his notice of appeal in a timely\n\nfashion actually caused harm.      The court further found that\n\nFerreira-Plasencia had not provided any expert testimony concerning\n\nthe relevant standard of care for his claim that the defendants did\n\nnot properly advise him of alternative avenues of relief from\n\ndeportation.\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f           Upon our de novo review, we find that the absence of\n\nevidence to support essential elements of Ferreira-Plasencia’s\n\nclaims is fatal to his case. He offered no evidence to establish\n\nthat the defendants' untimely filing of his notice of appeal caused\n\nhim to be deported and subsequently convicted for illegal re-entry\n\ninto the United States. He also failed to present expert testimony\n\nestablishing the standard of care owed to him on his claim that\n\ndefendants did not properly advise him as to alternative avenues\n\nfor relief from deportation. Accordingly, the district court\n\nproperly granted summary judgment.\n\n           On appeal, Ferreira-Plasencia faults the district court\n\nfor not sua sponte granting him a continuance, so he could obtain\n\nthe testimony of an expert. He contends that Rule 56(f) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure required the court to either deny\n\nthe motion for summary judgment or grant him a continuance. But\n\nhe did not seek to invoke Rule 56(f) below, and we have stated that\n\n\"in order to savor the balm of Rule 56(f), a party must move for\n\na discovery continuance in a timely fashion.\" Mass. Sch. of Law\n\nat Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar. Ass'n., 142 F.3d 26, 44 (1st Cir.\n\n1998)(internal quotation marks omitted). Not only did Ferreira-\n\nPlasencia fail to make a timely motion for a Rule 56(f)\n\ncontinuance, but he also failed to make any motion for any sort of\n\ncontinuance.\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f           We add, moreover, that a movant must generally show\n\ndiligence in conducting discovery. Simas v. First Citizens’ Fed.\n\nCredit Union, 170 F.3d 37, 45 n.4 (1st Cir. 1999).      Ferreira-\n\nPlasencia did not state what attempts he had made to obtain\n\nevidence to support his claim. Accordingly, we find no merit in\n\nhis argument that the district court erred by not spontaneously\n\ngranting him an unrequested continuance.\n\n           Ferreira-Plasencia also argues, for the first time on\n\nappeal, that the district court should have given him \"fair notice\"\n\nof the requirements of Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil\n\nProcedure and the consequences of failing to properly oppose such\n\na motion. The magistrate judge’s report and recommendation clearly\n\noutlined these requirements, and (assuming, without deciding, that\n\nnotice was required) we conclude that Ferreira-Plasencia thus\n\nreceived \"fair notice\" of the rule. Furthermore, because he did\n\nnot object to the magistrate’s recommendation that summary judgment\n\nbe granted to the defendants on the ground that he had no notice\n\nof the requirements of the rule, Ferreira-Plasencia has waived the\n\nargument. See Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d\n\n603 (1st Cir. 1980)(holding that the failure to file timely,\n\nspecific objections to a magistrate’s report and recommendation\n\nconstitutes waiver of the right to appeal the district court’s\n\ndecision).\n\n\n                               -4-\n\f         The district court’s grant of summary judgment to the\n\ndefendants is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                            -5-\n\f",
