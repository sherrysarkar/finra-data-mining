It is the fact that a defendant has committed an\r\n\naggravated felony  in this country  that makes  his crime  of\r\n\nreentry  more serious  and deserving  of  greater punishment.\r\n\nThat  the aggravated felony  was committed after  an order of\r\n\ndeportation  was issued (but  before the order  was executed)\r\n\ndoes  not at  all  reduce  the seriousness  of  the crime  of\r\n\nreentry or the  need for a greater deterrent  to reentry. See\r                                                                         \r\n\nCooke, 850 F. Supp. at 306.\r                 \r\n\n     If    2L1.2  were  aimed  at  producing  sentences  that\r\n\ndiffered based  upon the  reason for  the deportation  order,\r                                            \r\n\nthen   appellant's  argument  might  have  some  merit.    An\r\n\naggravated felony conviction that follows a deportation order\r\n\ncannot have been  the reason for the order.    The commentary\r\n\nto   2L1.2, however, specifically provides  that \"'[d]eported\r\n\nafter  a  conviction'  .  .  .   means  the  deportation  was\r\n\nsubsequent  to the conviction, whether or not the deportation\r\n\nwas in response to such conviction.\"   2L1.2, comment. (n.6).\r\n\nTherefore, the  Sentencing Commission clearly did  not intend\r\n\nto  increase  the  punishment only  for  defendants  who were\r\n\ndeported because of an aggravated felony conviction.\r                               \r\n\n     Appellant  argues  that  the  meaning  of  the  relevant\r\n\nguideline provision  is sufficiently ambiguous  that the rule\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nof  lenity  requires  resolution  in  his  favor.    We  have\r\n\nexplained the rule of lenity as follows:\r\n\n          When  all  else  fails   to  bring  sufficient\r\n     lucidity to the  meaning of the penal  statute, the\r\n     rule of lenity casts the decisive vote.  That rule,\r\n     which mandates  the resolution of ambiguities  in a\r\n     criminal  statute favorably  to the defendant  is a\r\n     'background principle that comes into play when, at\r\n     the end  of a  thorough inquiry,  the meaning of  a\r\n     criminal statute remains obscure.'\r\n\nUnited  States v.

In  this  case,  the meaning  of  the\r\n\nrelevant guidelines  provision does  not \"remain[]  obscure.\"\r\n\nThe  purposes and underlying policies of   2L1.2(b)(2) remove\r\n\nany possible  ambiguity created  by the  alleged inconsistent\r\n\nuse   of  the  term  \"deportation\"  in  the  Immigration  and\r\n\nNationality Act.  Therefore, the rule of lenity does not come\r\n\ninto play.     \r\n\n     Appellant's  sentence is summarily affirmed. See Loc.

His sole argument on appeal is that the district court misinterpreted Section 2L1.2 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines in imposing a 16-level enhancement to his base offense level because he had been \"previously deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue presented by this case is the meaning of the term \"deported\" for purposes of &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2).  We review that question of law  de novo.  See United States v. DiSanto, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196811\"><a href=\"/opinion/196811/united-states-v-disanto/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span>, 1244 (1st Cir.1996).  \"[A]lthough [the sentencing guidelines] are not statutes, [they] are to be construed in much the same fashion.\"   United States v. DeLuca, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195223\"><a href=\"/opinion/195223/united-states-v-deluca/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1994).  Therefore, construction of the relevant guideline section should begin \" 'by looking at the language of the law' and by examining the 'ordinary, contemporary, common meaning' of the words.\"   United States v. Holmquist, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195622\"><a href=\"/opinion/195622/united-states-v-holmquist/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, 159 (1st Cir.1994) (citations omitted), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1797</span></span> (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing inconsistent or ambiguous about the use of the term \"deported\" in &#167; 2L1.2 itself.  That guideline section, however, \"implements the statutory sentence enhancement provisions of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1326(b).\"   United States v. Restrepo-Aguilar, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196539\"><a href=\"/opinion/196539/united-states-v-restrepo-aguilar/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 363 n. 2 (1st Cir.1996).  We will accept for the purposes of this appeal the conclusion that the use of the term \"deported\" in &#167; 1326 and other sections of that statute is \"not entirely unambiguous.\"   United States v. Cooke, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">850</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></span>, 303 (E.D.Pa.1994), aff'd, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1162</span></span> (3d Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the sentencing court, however, that the purposes and underlying policy of U.S.S.G. &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2) remove any ambiguity that might otherwise exist regarding the meaning of \"deported\" in that context.  We interpret the word's meaning in light of the purposes of &#167; 2L1.2(B)(2).   See United States v. Caron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713036\"><a href=\"/opinion/713036/united-states-v-gerald-r-caron/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1996)(\" '[a]s in all cases of statutory construction, our task is to interpret the words of [the statute] in light of the purposes Congress sought to serve' \");   see also Holmquist, 36 F.3d at 160 (\"a statute must be read as a whole, with due regard for its object, purposes and underlying policy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Underlying the relevant guideline section are the following policy determinations by the Sentencing Commission:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>that the offense of unlawful reentry subsequent to perpetrating an aggravated felony is sufficiently more serious than the commission of the same offense while toting less weighty baggage and, thus, warrants greater punishment, [and] that an alien who, having been deported following a conviction for an aggravated felony, and having exhibited a willingness to flout our laws again by reentering the country without permission, may be more likely to commit serious crimes than an alien who unlawfully reenters this country with no criminal record or with a less sullied record, and, thus, deserves a sentence possessing greater deterrent impact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Zapata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194834\"><a href=\"/opinion/194834/united-states-v-zapata-medina/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The interpretation of \"deported\" urged by appellant is plainly inconsistent with the purposes and underlying policy of &#167; 2L1.2.  It is the fact that a defendant has committed an aggravated felony in this country that makes his crime of reentry more serious and deserving of greater punishment.  That the aggravated felony was committed after an order of deportation was issued (but before the order was executed) does not at all reduce the seriousness of the crime of reentry or the need for a greater deterrent to reentry.   See Cooke, 850 F.Supp. at 306.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If &#167; 2L1.2 were aimed at producing sentences that differed based upon the reason for the deportation order, then appellant's argument might have some merit.  An aggravated felony conviction that follows a deportation order cannot have been the reason for the order.  The commentary to &#167; 2L1.2, however, specifically provides that \" '[d]eported after a conviction' ... means the deportation was subsequent to the conviction, whether or not the deportation was in response to such conviction.\"  &#167; 2L1.2, comment.  (n.6).  Therefore, the Sentencing Commission clearly did not intend to increase the punishment only for defendants who were deported because of an aggravated felony conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the meaning of the relevant guideline provision is sufficiently ambiguous that the rule of lenity requires resolution in his favor.  We have explained the rule of lenity as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When all else fails to bring sufficient lucidity to the meaning of the penal statute, the rule of lenity casts the decisive vote.  That rule, which mandates the resolution of ambiguities in a criminal statute favorably to the defendant is a 'background principle that comes into play when, at the end of a thorough inquiry, the meaning of a criminal statute remains obscure.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Gibbens, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195396\"><a href=\"/opinion/195396/united-states-v-gibbens/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.1994) (citations omitted).  In this case, the meaning of the relevant guidelines provision does not \"remain[ ] obscure.\"   The purposes and underlying policies of &#167; 2L1.2(b)(2) remove any possible ambiguity created by the alleged inconsistent use of the term \"deportation\" in the Immigration and Nationality Act.  Therefore, the rule of lenity does not come into play.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's sentence is summarily affirmed.
