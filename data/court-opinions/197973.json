BLASINI-LLUBERAS,\r\n\n                  Defendant-Appellant.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n            FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\r\n\n   [Hon. Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n               Boudin, Lynch, and Lipez\r\n                   Circuit Judges.\r\n\nRoberto Boneta for appellant.\r\nJorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Assistant United States Attorney,\r\nwith whom Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, and Nelson Prez-\r\nSosa and Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States Attorneys, were\r\non brief for appellee.\r\n\nJanuary 25, 1999\r\n\nLIPEZ, Circuit Judge.  On April 5, 1995, a federal grand\r\njury returned a multiple count indictment against defendant Jose\r\nBlasini-Lluberas (\"Blasini\"), a former executive vice president of\r\nPonce Federal Bank, and his co-defendant, Ramiro Coln-Muoz\r\n(\"Coln\"), president of the bank.  The indictment charged both\r\ndefendants with five counts of misapplication of bank funds under\r\n18 U.S.C.  657, one count of bank fraud under 18 U.S.C.  1344,\r\none count of false entry under 18 U.S.C.  1006, one count of\r\nbenefitting, directly or indirectly, from the loan transactions in\r\nquestion under 18 U.S.C.  1006 and one count of conspiracy under\r\n18 U.S.C.  357.  The jury returned guilty verdicts against\r\nBlasini on all but one count, acquitting him on the charge of\r\nbenefitting from the loan transactions. On appeal, Blasini\r\nchallenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict,\r\ninstructions to the jury, and several aspects of the sentence. For\r\nthe reasons discussed below, we conclude that there was\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury verdict on four of the\r\nfive counts of misapplication of bank funds and order an acquittal\r\nas to those counts. Finding no reversible error in the jury\r\ninstructions, we affirm the remaining convictions and remand for\r\nre-sentencing. \r\n                          I.\r\nFrom a review of the evidence in this case, the jury\r\ncould have found the following.  On July 15, 1987, co-defendant\r\nRamiro Coln, president of Ponce Bank, and his wife purchased a\r\nfarm from thirteen members of the Usera family who had inherited\r\nthe farm from Julio Usera Santiago.  The total purchase price for\r\nthe farm, known as \"La Esmeralda\" and located in the municipality\r\nof Salinas, Puerto Rico, was $555,600.  Coln paid $83,340 at the\r\nclosing with the remaining balance due nine months later on April\r\n14, 1988.  The agreement provided that no interest would be due on\r\nthe outstanding balance.  As security for the $472,260 balance,\r\nColn granted the Usera family a mortgage on the property.\r\nFollowing Coln's purchase of the farm, but prior to the\r\ndue date of Coln's outstanding $472,260 obligation, four members\r\nof the Usera family approached Coln requesting money.  Monserrate\r\nUsera and her sister Ana Usera were the first two, approaching\r\nColn in August of 1987 for money to pay off personal debts:\r\nMonserrate needed funds to pay student loans and her daughter's\r\ncollege tuition; Ana Usera needed funds to make repairs to a\r\nbuilding.  Although Monserrate Usera understood that Coln's\r\nobligation to the family was not due until the spring of 1988, she\r\nwent to Coln for an advance.  Coln said he would look into\r\ngetting her the funds she needed.  Monserrate explained that when\r\nColn agreed to help her, she understood that she would be taking\r\nout a loan from the bank, the obligation for which was hers alone. \r\nAna Usera also decided to contact Coln in an effort to obtain\r\nmoney to pay off her current debts since it was taking such a long\r\ntime to complete the sale of the farm.  Ana explained that, after\r\nMonserrate Usera made the initial contact with Coln, they both\r\ndecided to \"make a loan.\"   Although Ana understood that she and\r\nher sister had other options, she thought it best to take out a\r\nloan from the bank to satisfy her outstanding obligations. \r\nSubsequent to these discussions, Coln sent the sisters\r\nto see Blasini, then an executive vice president of Ponce Federal\r\nBank. Coln instructed Blasini to assist each of them in securing\r\na loan from the bank, which he did.  As vice-president of the bank,\r\nBlasini was authorized to approve unsecured loans up to $50,000 and\r\nsecured loans up to $100,000. When the sisters arrived, he\r\nauthorized an $11,000 loan for each, subject to a rate of interest\r\nand a due date.  Neither loan application included a financial\r\nstatement or credit history. Monserrate Usera and Ana Usera signed\r\nthe promissory notes and executed partial assignments of their\r\nmortgage interests in the farm as security for the loans. The\r\npartial assignments were signed by both Blasini and Coln but were\r\nnot included in the loan file. The stated purpose for the loans was\r\npersonal; the means of repayment was the sale of a farm. Because\r\nthe loans did not exceed $50,000, their approval did not require\r\ncollateral.\r\nIn January of 1988, Carmen Maduro Usera, the mother of\r\nMonserrate Usera and Ana Usera, received a loan from Ponce Federal\r\nBank under similar circumstances.  Although the loan documentation\r\nwas introduced at trial, Carmen Maduro died before trial and her\r\ntestimony was never taken. Ana Usera testified that she helped her\r\nmother make arrangements over the phone to obtain a $15,000 loan\r\nand then accompanied her mother to the bank.  The documents\r\nthemselves indicated that Blasini authorized the loan, that the\r\npurpose of the loan was personal and that it was needed to pay off\r\nan outstanding $5,000 loan to the bank. The promissory note set a\r\nrate of interest and a due date for repayment. Although the\r\napplication did not include a financial statement or credit\r\nhistory, it noted that Carmen Maduro was well known to the Coln\r\nfamily. Carmen Maduro also executed a partial assignment of her\r\nmortgage interest as security for the loan one day after the loan\r\nwas disbursed to her, signed by Blasini and Coln, but it did not\r\nappear in the loan portfolio.\r\nIn March of 1998, Vincente Usera Tous received a $20,000\r\nloan from the bank, authorized by Blasini.  Vincente Usera also\r\ndied prior to trial and never testified about the loan transaction.\r\nAlthough he was a member of the Usera family, he did not stand to\r\ninherit proceeds from the sale of the farm. Instead, he was due a\r\ncommission of $23,613 for his assistance in brokering the sale of\r\nthe farm. His loan application, admitted in evidence, was missing\r\na financial statement and a credit history, but the application\r\nstated that he was well known to the bank, in particular to Coln,\r\nand that he was a responsible person. The stated means of repayment\r\nwas the commission from the sale of a farm.\r\nWhen Coln's debt to the Usera family came due on April\r\n14, 1988, he was unable to meet his obligation. On April 19, 1988,\r\nanother member of the Usera family, Consuelo Garcia-Gomez, went to\r\nthe bank and demanded payment of her share of the purchase price.\r\nConsuelo Garcia-Gomez was entitled to $200,000, the largest share\r\nof the inheritance.  Wendell Coln, Coln's brother, told Consuelo\r\nGarcia-Gomez that the money was not immediately available.  She\r\nthen asked for $100,000. Thereafter, Blasini brought Consuelo\r\nGarcia-Gomez to a loan officer and instructed the officer to\r\ndisburse a $100,000 loan to her. The information in her loan\r\napplication was provided to the loan officer by Blasini and the\r\napplication stated that collateral for the loan was a partial\r\nassignment of Consuelo's mortgage interest in the farm. The listed\r\npurpose of the loan was the purchase of an apartment. Directly\r\nabove Blasini's signature, Blasini wrote, \"discussed and agreed to\r\nby attorney R.C. Coln.\"  At trial Consuelo Garcia-Gomez explained\r\nthat, although she signed loan documents to receive the $100,000,\r\nshe did not go to the bank to obtain a loan and she never read the\r\nloan documents before signing the documents.  She maintained that\r\nthe $100,000 was partial payment of the money owed to her rather\r\nthan a loan. \r\nA few weeks later, in May, Coln wrote two sets of\r\nchecks.  The first set paid off the debts of Monserrate Usera, Ana\r\nUsera, Carmen Maduro, Vincete Usera and Consuelo Garcia-Gomez. He\r\nlisted the appropriate amount of their outstanding debts and named\r\nboth the bank and the borrower as joint payees. The second set paid\r\neach Usera the balance of what he or she was owed. Each member of\r\nthe Usera family then signed a cancellation of the mortgage.\r\nOn December 19, 1996, a jury convicted Blasini of the\r\ncharges described herein. On February 23, 1998, he was sentenced to\r\nthirteen months imprisonment to be followed by two years supervised\r\nrelease. He was fined $8,000.  Blasini now appeals.\r\n                         II.\r\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nWhen there is a challenge to the sufficiency of the\r\nevidence to support a guilty verdict, \"the relevant question is\r\nwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\nthe prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the\r\nessential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Jacksonv. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979). A conviction may rest, in\r\nwhole or in part, on circumstantial evidence. See United States v.\r\nMena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1031 (1st Cir. 1993). It is well\r\nestablished that \"an appellate court plays a very circumscribed\r\nrole in gauging the sufficiency of the evidentiary foundation upon\r\nwhich a criminal conviction rests.\" United States v. Woodward, 149\r\nF.3d 46, 56 (1st Cir. 1998).  Nevertheless, we have cautioned that\r\n\"[d]espite the deference that characterizes appellate review of\r\njury verdicts, juries do not have carte blanche. The appellate\r\nfunction . . . requires the reviewing court to take a hard look at\r\nthe record and to reject those evidentiary interpretations and\r\nillations that are unreasonable, insupportable, or overly\r\nspeculative.\" Id. (quoting United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231,\r\n234 (1st Cir. 1995)). We noted that \"[t]his function is especially\r\nimportant in criminal cases, given the prosecution's obligation to\r\nprove every element . . . beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. at 56-57\r\n(quoting Spinney, 65 F.3d at 234).  We must reverse a conviction\r\n\"on the grounds of evidentiary insufficiency where an equal or\r\nnearly equal theory of guilt[] and a theory of innocence is\r\nsupported by the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the\r\nverdict.\" Id. at 57 (citing United States v. Guerrero, 114 F.3d\r\n332, 344 (1st Cir. 1997))(internal citations omitted).\r\nB. Misapplication\r\nCourts have struggled to give precise definition to the\r\ncrime of misapplication, consistently noting that \"[t]he problem\r\nthat has confronted and perplexed the courts is that there is no\r\nstatutory definition or common law heritage that gives content to\r\nthe phrase 'willfully misapplies.'\" United States v. Wester, 90\r\nF.3d 592, 595 (1st Cir. 1996). These uncertain origins have posed\r\na challenge to courts attempting to distinguish bad judgment from\r\nbad conduct that is illegal. Nevertheless, in Wester, we recently\r\ndiscussed the two notions that underlie the crime of\r\nmisapplication:  one relating to conduct, i.e., wrongful use of\r\nbank funds, the other focusing on an intent to injure or defraud a\r\nbank. The government cannot prove its claim of misapplication\r\nwithout establishing both elements. See id. The interrelationship\r\nbetween these elements is subtle, given that \"the same facts can\r\neasily be the basis for deeming the conduct to be wrongful and the\r\nintent fraudulent.\" Id.  \r\n               Counts Two through Five \r\nIn this case, the government's theory was that Blasini\r\nwas attempting to deceive the bank as to the true purposes of the\r\nloans: namely, that the disbursements to the Usera family were\r\npartial payments of Coln's debt.  However, Coln's obligation to\r\nthe Usera family did not come due until April 14, 1988. Blasini\r\napproved loans to Monserrate Usera and Ana Usera in August of 1987;\r\nto Carmen Maduro in January of 1988; and to Vincete Usera Tous in\r\nMarch of 1988.  Because Coln had no current obligation to the\r\nUseras at the time these four loans were extended, the loans cannot\r\nbe characterized as partial payments of a debt.  Both Ana Usera and\r\nMonserrate Usera testified that they needed money and, since the\r\nbalance on the farm would not come due for many months, they went\r\nto Coln to seek an advance of funds.  Although the jury could have\r\nconcluded from this testimony that they were initially requesting\r\nan advance of the money Coln owed them, both sisters testified\r\nthat they understood they were executing and signing loan\r\ndocuments. Ana Usera testified that, following her discussions with\r\nher sister and Coln, she decided to take out a loan from the bank. \r\nMonserrate Usera explained that she understood her obligation to\r\nthe bank and she noted that, even if Coln had not paid the balance\r\nof his debt, she would have paid the balance of the loan.  Although\r\nwe have no direct testimony concerning Carmen Usera's loan, her\r\ndaughter Ana testified that her mother was also interested in\r\nobtaining a loan to satisfy some of her debts. The government's\r\ntheory that Blasini was executing \"sham\" loans and intending to\r\ndefraud the bank as to their true purpose is simply not supported\r\nby the evidence. \r\nWith regard to Vincente Usera, the government's theory of\r\nmisapplication is even weaker.  Coln had no outstanding obligation\r\nto Vincente Usera, who was simply owed a commission following the\r\nsale of the property. He was not entitled to a share of the\r\nprofits. There was no debt that Coln had to pay at any time.\r\nNor are there \"other circumstances\" sufficient to convert\r\nthese loans into misapplication of bank funds. See United States v.\r\nGens, 493 F.2d 216, 222 (1st Cir. 1974)(holding that \"where the\r\nnamed debtor is both financially capable and fully understands that\r\nit is his responsibility to repay, a loan to him cannot   absent\r\nother circumstances   properly be characterized as a sham or\r\ndummy\"). The loan applications lacked financial statements and\r\ncredit histories yet they comported with minimal requirements for\r\nlegitimate loans. The former Ponce Bank commercial credit officer\r\ntestified that she could not think of any bank policy which would\r\nforbid the bank to disburse a loan without any financial statement. \r\nSimilarly, she testified that the lack of a credit history did not\r\nmean that a loan could not be authorized.  The stated purpose on\r\nthe loans was accurate and Blasini was well within his authority to\r\napprove the loans.  The four members of the Usera family signed\r\npromissory notes and partial assignments for the loans.  Although\r\nthe partial assignments of Coln's obligations to the Useras were\r\nnot included in all of the loan applications, collateral was not\r\nrequired for these loans and thus the partial assignments were not\r\nprerequisites to their authorization. At trial the government\r\nsuggested that the failure to include the partial assignments in\r\nthe files was an attempt to withhold the fact that Coln's future\r\nobligation was the means of intended repayment for the parties.\r\nThis omission, without more, is not enough to transform the\r\ntransactions into willful misapplication of bank funds.\r\nWe do not mean to suggest that Coln and Blasini were not\r\nplaying it close to the line. Blasini may have been helping Coln\r\nto curry favor with the Usera family so that they would be lenient\r\nwith Coln in the event that Coln had trouble satisfying his\r\nobligations. This possibility, however, given the totality of the\r\ncircumstances, does not rise to the level of willful\r\nmisapplication.\r\n                      Count Six\r\nThe loan to Consuelo Garcia-Gomez stands in stark\r\ncontrast to the other four loans. Coln's debt to the Usera family\r\nhad matured and he was late with payment. Consuelo Garcia-Gomez\r\nwent to the bank and demanded payment.  She did not request a loan.\r\nAt the bank she initially met with Coln's brother who informed her\r\nthat the money was not available. She demanded that he pay her\r\nsomething and she suggested $100,000. Thereafter, Blasini took\r\nConsuelo Garcia-Gomez to meet with the loan officer and instructed\r\nthe officer on the details of the loan application.  On the actual\r\napplication, Blasini included the notation, \"discussed and agreed\r\nto by attorney R.C. Coln.\" Although there is some uncertainty in\r\nthe evidence as to how Consuelo Garcia-Gomez was brought to\r\nBlasini's attention, the jury could have reasonably concluded,\r\ngiven Blasini's notation on the application, that Coln himself\r\ncontacted Blasini and requested that Blasini facilitate a $100,000\r\nloan from the bank to Consuelo Garcia-Gomez.  \r\nIn cross-examination of Consuelo Garcia-Gomez, Blasini\r\nattempted to show that she knew she was taking out a loan from the\r\nbank. Consuelo Garcia-Gomez denied this knowledge, maintaining that\r\nshe did not pay any attention to what she was signing, even though\r\nshe signed and notarized all the pertinent documentation for a\r\n$100,000 loan. She was simply happy that she was getting at least\r\nhalf of what was owed to her.  Morever, there was evidence,\r\ndiscussed infra, from which the jury could conclude that Blasini\r\nmisrepresented the purpose of the loan in the application (stating\r\nthat the loan was for the purchase of an apartment). As a result of\r\nthis deceptive conduct, Blasini caused the bank to part with its\r\nmonies through a sham loan to pay a portion of Coln's delinquent\r\ndebt.  This wrongful use of bank money, carried out with an intent\r\nto deceive the bank about the true nature of the transaction,\r\ninvolved all of the essential elements of the crime of\r\nmisapplication. \r\nC. Bank Fraud\r\n The Government charged Blasini with one count of bank\r\nfraud, the elements of which are well established: 1) the defendant\r\nmust engage in a scheme or artifice to defraud, or must make false\r\nstatements or misrepresentations to obtain money from 2) a\r\nfinancial institution and 3) must do so knowingly. See United\r\nStates v. Brandon, 17 F.3d 409, 424 (1st Cir. 1994).  A scheme or\r\nartifice is defined to include \"any plan, pattern or course of\r\naction, including false and fraudulent pretenses and\r\nmisrepresentations intended to deceive others in order to obtain\r\nsomething of value.\" Id.  (emphasis added)(quoting United States v.\r\nGoldblatt, 813 F.2d 619, 624 (3d Cir. 1987)). The statute provides\r\nthat each execution of a scheme to defraud will constitute a\r\nseparate indictable offense.  See 18 U.S.C.  1344; see alsoBrandon, 17 F.3d at 422.  We have explained that \"each time an\r\nidentifiable sum of money is obtained by a specific fraudulent\r\ntransfer, there is likely to be a separate execution of a scheme to\r\ndefraud.\" Id.  The government need not prove actual loss as a\r\nresult of the scheme, however. See United States v. Goldblatt, 813\r\nF.2d 619, 624 (3d Cir. 1987)(\"The Government was not required to\r\nshow that [the bank] incurred a loss in order to prove a scheme to\r\ndefraud . . . .\"); see also Brandon, 17 F.3d at 427. Nor must the\r\ngovernment show that the defendant personally benefitted from the\r\nalleged scheme. See Goldblatt, 813 F.2d at 624. \r\nIn the indictment, the government charged Blasini with\r\none count of bank fraud based on five separate loan transactions,\r\neach of which could have served as the basis for the fraud\r\nallegation. See Brandon, 17 F.3d at 422. Thus, the bank fraud\r\nconviction is unaffected by our finding that four of the loans were\r\nlegitimate.  With respect to the fifth transaction, the evidence\r\nwas sufficient for the jury to conclude that Blasini's conduct\r\nsatisfied the elements of bank fraud because he knowingly engaged\r\nin a scheme to obtain bank funds, deceitfully characterized as a\r\nloan, to satisfy $100,000 of Coln's outstanding obligation to\r\nConsuelo Garcia-Gomez. Proof of Blasini's intent to deceive, a\r\nnecessary element of the misapplication charge, was also proof of\r\nhis scheme to obtain money from the bank by false representation,\r\na necessary element of the charge of bank fraud.  Accordingly, the\r\nevidence establishing misapplication of bank funds on the fifth\r\nloan also supports a conviction on the charge of bank fraud. \r\nD. False Entry\r\nWe have not had an occasion to construe  1006.   Read\r\nliterally,  1006 provides that any employee of an insured bank who\r\nmakes a false entry in any statement to such institution with the\r\nintent to defraud such institution is subject to federal penalty.\r\nSee 18 U.S.C.  1006.  In interpreting this section, however, the\r\nFifth Circuit has read a \"materiality\" requirement into the\r\nprovision: that is, the government must show that the defendant\r\nknowingly and willfully made or caused to be made a false entry\r\nconcerning a material fact in any statement to the institution.\r\nSee United States v. Parks, 68 F.3d 860, 865 (5th Cir. 1995). ButCf. United States v. Harvard, 103 F.3d 412, 417-20 (5th Cir.\r\n1997)(finding that materiality is not an element of 18 U.S.C. \r\n1005, a nearly identical statute).  In his argument, Blasini adopts\r\nthe Fifth Circuit's approach and contends that materiality is an\r\nelement of the crime. The government also reads  1006 to include\r\nmateriality as an element of the crime. \r\nDespite the shared views of the parties that materiality\r\nis an element of the statute, we can find no other circuit court\r\nwhich has directly addressed this question. Recently, in United\r\nStates v. Wells, 519 U.S. 482, 117 S. Ct. 921 (1997), the Supreme\r\nCourt indicated its intent to construe similar statutory\r\ndefinitions narrowly.  There the Court concluded that materiality\r\nof the falsehood was not an element of knowingly making a false\r\nstatement to a federally insured bank under 18 U.S.C.  1014:\r\n\"Nowhere does it further say that a material fact must be the\r\nsubject of the false statement or so much as mention materiality.\r\n. . . Thus, under the first criterion in the interpretive\r\nhierarchy, a natural reading of the full text, materiality would\r\nnot be an element of  1014.\" Wells, 117 S. Ct. at 927(internal\r\ncitations omitted). The Court went on to conclude that the common\r\nlaw would not import a materiality requirement into the term \"false\r\nstatement\" and that ultimately the \"statutory history confirm[ed]\r\nthe natural reading.\" Id. at 928. \r\nIn light of this recent pronouncement of the Supreme\r\nCourt about a comparable statutory provision, the absence of\r\nadvocacy in this case on the inclusion of a materiality element in \r\n1006, and our own conclusion that the evidence was sufficient to\r\nallow the jury to conclude 1) that the entry in question was false\r\nand 2) that it was material, we assume without deciding that\r\nmateriality is an element of the crime of false entry for the\r\npurposes of this appeal.\r\nMarisel Marrero, an assistant manager of the bank at the\r\ntime in question, testified that Blasini instructed her to prepare\r\ndocumentation for a loan to Consuelo Garcia-Gomez. She testified\r\nthat Blasini provided her with the basic information for the\r\napplication and instructed her that the purpose of Consuelo Garcia-\r\nGomez's loan was the purchase of an apartment. Given Consuelo\r\nGarcia-Gomez's testimony that she did not believe she was taking\r\nout a loan, and given her brother's testimony that she was not\r\nintending to purchase an apartment, it was reasonable for the jury\r\nto conclude that the statement on the loan application about the\r\npurchase of an apartment was false and that Blasini knew it to be\r\nso.\r\nMateriality requires proof that the entry would have the\r\ncapability or tendency to influence the bank in its decision-making\r\nprocess, or impair or pervert the functioning of the government\r\ninstitution. See United States v. Parks, 68 F.3d 860, 865 (5th Cir.\r\n1995); see also United States v. Corsino, 812 F.2d 26, 30 (1st Cir.\r\n1987)(discussing the materiality requirement in 18 U.S.C.  1001).\r\n\"[T]he standard is not whether there was actual influence, but\r\nwhether it would have a tendency to influence.\" United States v.\r\nEdgar, 82 F.3d 499, 510 (1st Cir. 1996). Thus, the government is\r\nrequired to demonstrate the false entry's potential effect on the\r\ngovernmental agency, even if the false entry did not actually\r\naffect the government function. See United States v. Swaim, 757\r\nF.2d 1530, 1534 (5th Cir. 1985)( the government need not show\r\nactual reliance on the false statement, only that the statement\r\nitself would have impacted the bank).\r\nIronically, it was Blasini's own expert witness who\r\noffered the testimony from which the jury could reasonably have\r\nconcluded that the false entry as to the purpose of the loan would\r\nhave the tendency to influence the bank's decision or,\r\nalternatively, would affect a bank examiner's later review of the\r\npropriety of the loan.  Michael Cinkala, a bank examiner with over\r\ntwenty years experience, testified that \"the information you would\r\nbe looking for in a loan file would be, for instance, the financial\r\nstatement of an individual or corporation, the collateral, the  \r\nany comments written as to the character of the individual, the\r\npurpose of the loan, [and] some ability to repay the loan.\" From\r\nthis testimony, the jury could conclude that the stated purpose on\r\nthe loan application would be the type of information relied upon\r\nby bank examiners in reviewing loans to determine whether the bank\r\nis adhering to proper procedures.  Accordingly, we find that the\r\njury was presented with sufficient evidence from which it could\r\nconclude that the entry on the loan application was false and\r\nmaterial in violation of  1006.\r\nBlasini further contends that the court's failure to\r\ndefine \"materiality\" in its instructions to the jury was reversible\r\nerror. Blasini did not raise this objection to the instruction at\r\ntrial and our review is for plain error. See United States v.\r\nSantana-Rosa, 132 F.3d 860, 863 (1st Cir. 1998). \"[E]rror rises to\r\nthis level only when it is so 'shocking that [it] seriously\r\naffect[ed] the fundamental fairness and basic integrity of the\r\nproceedings conducted below.'\" United States v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21,\r\n25 (1st Cir. 1994)(citation omitted). We \"review the context of the\r\ncharge as a whole to determine if it contains an error that\r\nthreatens to undermine the fundamental fairness of the trial.\"\r\nSantana-Rosa, 132 F.3d at 863 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\nAgain, assuming that materiality is an element of the\r\ncrime, the court's failure to define \"materiality\" in its\r\ninstructions to the jury on the charge of false entry does not\r\nconstitute plain error. The issue of materiality was submitted to\r\nthe jury, with instructions that the false entry must be material\r\nand that materiality was an essential element of the crime. \r\nBlasini did not offer an objection to the instruction at trial and\r\nmakes no developed argument on appeal why failure to define\r\nmaterial would constitute plain error.  We conclude that\r\n\"materiality\" is not such a technical concept outside of the\r\njurors' experience that failure to define it rises to the level of\r\nplain error. Cf. United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1495 (1st\r\nCir. 1997)(meaning of the word \"intimidate\" not outside a juror's\r\nunderstanding such that failure to define the word would be an\r\nerror that threatened to undermine the fundamental fairness of the\r\ntrial).\r\nE. Conspiracy \r\nTo convict Blasini on a charge of conspiracy, the\r\ngovernment was required to establish that: a conspiracy existed;\r\nBlasini knew of and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy; and\r\nan overt act took place in furtherance of the conspiracy.  SeeUnited States v. Woodward, 149 F.3d 46, 67 (1st Cir. 1998). The\r\nagreement can be tacit rather than express. See id. Neither the\r\nagreement nor Blasini's participation in furtherance of the\r\nagreement need be proved by direct evidence. See id. at 68.\r\nWe reject Blasini's contention that there was\r\ninsufficient evidence to support the conspiracy conviction.  As\r\ndiscussed above, there was sufficient evidence from which the jury\r\ncould conclude that Blasini engaged in misapplication of bank\r\nfunds, bank fraud and making a false entry on a loan application --\r\nthe three substantive counts underlying the conspiracy count. There\r\nwas direct evidence of Blasini's conspiracy with Coln to use bank\r\nfunds to satisfy Coln's outstanding debt: Consuelo Garcia-Gomez's\r\napplication includes a handwritten notation by Blasini stating that\r\nthe loan was \"discussed and agreed to by attorney R.C. Colon.\" \r\nMoreover, there was circumstantial evidence from which the jury\r\ncould infer that Blasini agreed to assist Coln in satisfying his\r\ndebt to Consuelo Garcia-Gomez with bank funds, and that he\r\nknowingly participated in the execution of the plan to use bank\r\nfunds for this purpose.\r\nFinally, Blasini contends that the use of a general\r\nverdict form invalidates his conviction on the conspiracy count\r\nbecause the jury acquitted him on Count Nine, one of the overt acts\r\ncharged in furtherance of the conspiracy.  He claims that \"the use\r\nof a general verdict form does not reveal which objects or overt\r\nacts the jury relied on to find Appellant guilty of conspiracy.\"  \r\nThis argument is against the force of the law and was rejected in\r\nGriffin v. United States, 502 U.S. 46, (1991), where the Supreme\r\nCourt stated: \"When a jury returns a verdict on an indictment\r\ncharging several acts in the conjunctive . . . the verdict stands\r\nif the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts\r\ncharged.\" Id. at 55-56 (quoting Turner v. United States, 396 U.S.\r\n398, 420 (1970)); see also United States v. Mitchell, 85 F.3d 800,\r\n810-811 (1st Cir. 1996)(discussing application of Griffin). The use\r\nof a general verdict form does not invalidate the verdict on Count\r\nOne. See United States v. Fisher, 22 F.3d 574, 576 (5th Cir.\r\n1994)(holding that in light of Griffin, there is no error in the\r\nuse of a general verdict form for a conspiracy count).  \r\nIII. Sentencing\r\nIn light of the convictions that must be vacated, we must\r\nalso vacate the sentence.  We do so without analyzing the alleged\r\nerrors in sentencing. On remand, the sentencing court will have the\r\nfull opportunity to re-evaluate and recalculate Blasini's sentence\r\nin light of our rulings. See United States v. Pimienta-Redondo, 874\r\nF.2d 9, 14 (1st Cir. 1989)(\"When the conviction on one or more of\r\nthe component counts is vacated, common sense dictates that the\r\njudge should be free to review the efficacy of what remains in\r\nlight of the original plan, and to reconstruct the sentencing\r\narchitecture upon remand, within applicable constitutional and\r\nstatutory limits if that appears necessary in order to ensure that\r\nthe punishment still fits both crime and criminal.\").\r\nThe judgment is VACATED on Counts Two through Five,\r\nAFFIRMED on Counts One, Six, Seven and Eight, and REMANDED for re-\r\nsentencing.  Upon remand, the district court shall enter a judgment\r\nof acquittal on Counts Two through Five.\n",
