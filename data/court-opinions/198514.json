Salvador E.

Upon careful review of the briefs and\r\nrecord, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err\r\nin sentencing defendant based on the drug quantity to which he\r\nspecifically pled guilty.  Given defendant's plain admissions\r\nat the plea hearing and the lack of a developed challenge to\r\nthe validity of the plea, defendant will not now be heard to\r\nargue about the drug quantity.  See United States v. Martinez-\r\nMartinez, 69 F.3d 1215, 1224 (1st Cir. 1995).  The district\r\ncourt was not required, on the record before it, to adopt\r\ndefendant's revised, post-plea version of his involvement with\r\nthe drug shipment.\r\n          Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
