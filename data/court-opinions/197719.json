Defendant-appellant Roderick L. Senior\r                      Per Curiam\r                                \r\n\npled guilty  to being  a deported alien  found in  the United\r\n\nStates without the consent of the Attorney  General, 8 U.S.C.\r\r\n\n  1326,  and was  sentenced to 51  months' imprisonment,  the\r\n\nguidelines  minimum.  He  appeals his sentence,  arguing that\r\n\n(1)  he  is entitled  to  a sentence  reduction,  pursuant to\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    5G1.3(b), for time  served on a  prior conviction\r\n\ntaken into account  in determining his  guidelines sentencing\r\n\nrange; (2) he is entitled to a sentence reduction because the\r\n\ndistrict  court improperly  applied  U.S.S.G.    4A1.1(d)  in\r\n\ncalculating  his criminal  history category;  and  (3) he  is\r\n\nentitled  to a downward  departure for agreeing  to immediate\r\n\ndeportation.1    We  reject these  arguments  and  affirm his\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n          Senior, a  native and  citizen of Jamaica,  entered\r\n\nthe United States at Miami  in 1983 using a counterfeit birth\r\n\ncertificate.     In   1989,  he   pled   guilty  in   Suffolk\r\n\n(Massachusetts) Superior Court  to possession with intent  to\r\n\ndistribute   cocaine,  and   received  a   five-to-seven-year\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.    Senior also argues that the district  court erroneously\r\nprecluded his attack,  at his sentencing hearing, on  a prior\r\nstate conviction.  At oral argument, however, Senior conceded\r\nthat Custis v. United States,  511 U.S. 485 (1994) forecloses\r                                        \r\nthis argument.   See United  States v. Cordero, 42  F.3d 697,\r                                                          \r\n701 (1st Cir. 1994)(applying Custis to  guidelines sentencing\r                                               \r\nhearings).\r\n     Senior also raises, in his  pro se supplemental brief, a\r                                                   \r\nconcern  that  his  presentence   report  misstated  a  prior\r\noffense,  and  that  this  error  may  adversely  affect  his\r\ntreatment  while incarcerated.   We resolved this  concern at\r\noral  argument by eliciting the government's pledge to attach\r\na letter  of correction to  Senior's Bureau of  Prisons file.\r\nThe government has followed through on its promise.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nsentence.   In December 1991, Massachusetts paroled Senior to\r\n\nthe  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service  (INS),  which\r\n\nidentified  him as  a deportable  aggravated  felon and,  the\r\n\nfollowing  month, deported him  to Jamaica.   Deportation did\r\n\nnot change his parole status, which was scheduled to continue\r\n\nuntil November 28, 1994.\r\n\n          In April  1992, Senior reentered the  United States\r\n\nwithout the  consent of  the Attorney  General.   In  October\r\n\n1992, he pled guilty to menacing in New York state court, and\r\n\nhe  subsequently failed  to  appear  for  sentencing.    This\r\n\nepisode  defaulted  Senior's   Massachusetts  parole  status.\r\n\nConsequently,  in  December  1992,  the Massachusetts  Parole\r\n\nBoard issued  a warrant for  his arrest.  Nearly  three years\r\n\nlater, in  September 1995, he  was found and arrested  in New\r\n\nYork,  returned to Massachusetts  on his parole  warrant, and\r\n\nincarcerated in Massachusetts' MCI Gardener prison because of\r\n\nthe parole violation.\r\n\n          On  March  15, 1996,  Massachusetts  again released\r\n\nSenior to  the INS.  He  remained in INS custody  until April\r\n\n1996,  when the  indictment in  this case  was returned.   It\r\n\ncharged  Senior  with being  a  deported alien  found  in the\r\n\nUnited States -- at MCI Gardener on March 15, 1996 -- without\r\n\nthe consent of the Attorney General.  Following return of the\r\n\nindictment,  the district court ordered Senior detained.  His\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndetention continued until his sentencing, which took place in\r\n\nNovember 1996.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\nA.  Sentence Reduction Under U.S.S.G.   5G1.32\r                                                         \r\n\n          Senior  contends  that,  pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.    \r\n\n5G1.3(b), the district court should have reduced his sentence\r\n\nto account for  time served in Massachusetts prison beginning\r\n\nSeptember 28, 1995.  He observes that application note two of\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   5G1.3(b) requires  courts to reduce a  sentence by\r\n\nthe  period of  imprisonment already  served  as a  result of\r\n\nconduct  taken into  account  in the  sentence.   He  further\r\n\nasserts that his  case fits within  this proviso because  his\r\n\ntime served  since September 28,  1995 resulted from  a state\r\n\nconviction  that the district court used  to enhance his base\r\n\noffense level from 8 to 24.\r\n\n          At the outset, Senior faces an uphill climb because\r\n\nthis argument  is raised for  the first time  on appeal.   We\r\n\ntherefore review only for plain  error.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nTaylor, 54 F.3d 967, 972 (1st Cir. 1995).  We may  find plain\r                  \r\n\nerror only if  the error \"skewed the  fundamental fairness or\r\n\nbasic  integrity  of  the  proceeding  below  in  some  major\r\n\nrespect.\"  Id. at 973.  And we may correct such an error only\r                          \r\n\nif \"a  miscarriage of justice  would otherwise result.\"   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.   All references are to the 1995 version of the sentencing\r\nguidelines, which indisputably apply here.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n(citing  United  States v.  Frady,  456  U.S.  152, 163  n.14\r                                             \r\n\n(1982)).\r\n\n          Senior's   argument   overlooks   the   fact   that\r\n\napplication note 2 of U.S.S.G   5G1.3(b) is triggered only by\r\n\na district  court determination  that the  Bureau of  Prisons\r\n\nwill  not credit a federal  sentence with time already served\r\n\nfor  conduct taken into account in determining the guidelines\r\n\nrange.   See U.S.S.G.    5G1.3, comment.  (n. 2).   Here, the\r                        \r\n\npresentence  report indicates that the Bureau of Prisons will\r\n\nreduce Senior's  sentence for  his time  served beginning  on\r\n\nSeptember  28, 1995.   The  district  court, by  implication,\r\n\nadopted this  conclusion, and  Senior does  not contest  it.3\r\n\nRather, Senior does not allege  that his time served will not\r\n\nproperly  be credited  by  the Bureau  of Prisons;  he merely\r\n\nseeks,  by  another means,  what  he is  already  destined to\r\n\nreceive.  Thus, we find no error, let alone plain error.\r\n\nB.  Alleged Error in Applying U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(d)\r                                                             \r\n\n          Senior contends, in his pro se supplemental  brief,\r                                                    \r\n\nthat  the  district  court  should  not  have  increased  his\r\n\ncriminal  history category  by two  points  under U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n4A1.1(d) because he was not under a criminal justice sentence\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.    Indeed, Senior recognized in his brief: \"Although there\r\nis some indication  in the record that the  Bureau of Prisons\r\nwould deal with  the matter of  the credit to  be awarded  to\r\ndefendant, the defendant was entitled by the clear mandate of\r\nthe   guideline  and  commentary  to  the  reduction  of  his\r\nsentence.\"  Id.\r                           \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nat the time of the instant offense.  Questions such as  this,\r\n\nwhich involve the  applicability of  a sentencing  guideline,\r\n\nare  reviewed by this  court de novo.   See  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRuiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1504 (1st Cir. 1997).  \r                \r\n\n          Senior correctly  states that  U.S.S.G.    4A1.1(d)\r\n\napplies only  if the  instant offense  occurred while he  was\r\n\nunder a criminal justice sentence.   He then argues that this\r\n\nguideline does  not apply because the execution of his arrest\r\n\nwarrant in 1995  occurred after the scheduled  discharge date\r\n\nof his parole.  Therefore, in his view, two points should not\r\n\nhave been added to his criminal history category.\r\n\n          Senior  mistakenly  perceives  his  arrest  on  the\r\n\nMassachusetts  warrant as the relevant offense.  The relevant\r\n\noffense, i.e., the  one for which he was  sentenced, is being\r\n\nillegally in this country without the consent of the Attorney\r\n\nGeneral, 8 U.S.C.   1326.   Senior's argument thus rests on a\r\n\nfaulty premise.  \r\n\n          At any  rate, whether  we look to  the date  of his\r\n\nunlawful reentry (in  April 1992) or of his  apprehension (on\r\n\nMarch 15, 1996), Senior was under a criminal justice sentence\r\n\nat either time.  It seems obvious that, in April 1992, Senior\r\n\nwas  still on  parole for  his 1989  possession offense,  and\r\n\nthat, on March 15, 1996, Senior was still imprisoned for that\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nparole  violation.4   Accordingly, we  find  no error  in the\r\n\ndistrict court's application of U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(d).\r\n\nC.  Downward Departure for Agreeing to be Deported\r                                                              \r\n\n          Lastly,  Senior argues  that  the district  court's\r\n\ndecision  not to grant a downward  departure for his agreeing\r\n\nto be deported  is reviewable because it was  not an exercise\r\n\nof discretion but a ruling based on  a mistaken understanding\r\n\nof  the law.   Senior  further asserts  that, because  of its\r\n\nmistaken  understanding that it  could not depart,  the court\r\n\ndid not consider the facts or merits of his request.\r\n\n          A district  court's discretionary  decision not  to\r\n\ndepart  below   the  guideline   sentencing   range  is   not\r\n\nreviewable,  except where  there is  a mistake  of law.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 619 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                   \r\n\n          We need not  decide whether the district  court had\r\n\nthe authority to grant the requested downward departure.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court made  it  clear  that it  would  not grant  a\r\n\ndownward departure even if it could.  Clearly, this statement\r\n\nbelies  Senior's contention that  the court did  not consider\r\n\nthe   merits  of  his  argument  for  a  downward  departure.\r\n\nMoreover,  it renders utterly  harmless any mistaken  view of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.   We  look to  both the date  of reentry  and the  date of\r\napprehension  because the  indictment did  not charge  Senior\r\nwith  unlawful reentry; it only charged  him with being found\r\nin  the  United  States, without  consent  from  the Attorney\r\nGeneral, following  arrest and  deportation.  Because  Senior\r\nwas under a criminal justice  sentence on both dates, we need\r\nnot decide which is applicable.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthe  law harbored by  the court.   Therefore, even if  we had\r\n\njurisdiction to entertain this argument, we would reject it.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed\r                              \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n",

He  appeals his sentence,  arguing that\r\n\n(1)  he  is entitled  to  a sentence  reduction,  pursuant to\r\n\nU.S.S.G.    5G1.3(b), for time  served on a  prior conviction\r\n\ntaken into account  in determining his  guidelines sentencing\r\n\nrange; (2) he is entitled to a sentence reduction because the\r\n\ndistrict  court improperly  applied  U.S.S.G.    4A1.1(d)  in\r\n\ncalculating  his criminal  history category;  and  (3) he  is\r\n\nentitled  to a downward  departure for agreeing  to immediate\r\n\ndeportation.1    We  reject these  arguments  and  affirm his\r\n\nsentence.\r\n\n                              I.\r                                          I.\r                                            \r\n\n          Senior, a  native and  citizen of Jamaica,  entered\r\n\nthe United States at Miami  in 1983 using a counterfeit birth\r\n\ncertificate.     In   1989,  he   pled   guilty  in   Suffolk\r\n\n(Massachusetts) Superior Court  to possession with intent  to\r\n\ndistribute   cocaine,  and   received  a   five-to-seven-year\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.

See United  States v. Cordero, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195801\"><a href=\"/opinion/195801/united-states-v-cordero-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r                                                          \r\n701 (1st Cir. 1994)(applying Custis to  guidelines sentencing\r                                               \r\nhearings).\r\n     Senior also raises, in his  pro se supplemental brief, a\r                                                   \r\nconcern  that  his  presentence   report  misstated  a  prior\r\noffense,  and  that  this  error  may  adversely  affect  his\r\ntreatment  while incarcerated.   We resolved this  concern at\r\noral  argument by eliciting the government's pledge to attach\r\na letter  of correction to  Senior's Bureau of  Prisons file.\r\nThe government has followed through on its promise.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nsentence.   In December 1991, Massachusetts paroled Senior to\r\n\nthe  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Service  (INS),  which\r\n\nidentified  him as  a deportable  aggravated  felon and,  the\r\n\nfollowing  month, deported him  to Jamaica.   Deportation did\r\n\nnot change his parole status, which was scheduled to continue\r\n\nuntil November 28, 1994.\r\n\n          In April  1992, Senior reentered the  United States\r\n\nwithout the  consent of  the Attorney  General.   In  October\r\n\n1992, he pled guilty to menacing in New York state court, and\r\n\nhe  subsequently failed  to  appear  for  sentencing.    This\r\n\nepisode  defaulted  Senior's   Massachusetts  parole  status.\r\n\nConsequently,  in  December  1992,  the Massachusetts  Parole\r\n\nBoard issued  a warrant for  his arrest.  Nearly  three years\r\n\nlater, in  September 1995, he  was found and arrested  in New\r\n\nYork,  returned to Massachusetts  on his parole  warrant, and\r\n\nincarcerated in Massachusetts' MCI Gardener prison because of\r\n\nthe parole violation.\r\n\n          On  March  15, 1996,  Massachusetts  again released\r\n\nSenior to  the INS.  He  remained in INS custody  until April\r\n\n1996,  when the  indictment in  this case  was returned.   It\r\n\ncharged  Senior  with being  a  deported alien  found  in the\r\n\nUnited States -- at MCI Gardener on March 15, 1996 -- without\r\n\nthe consent of the Attorney General.  Following return of the\r\n\nindictment,  the district court ordered Senior detained.  His\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\ndetention continued until his sentencing, which took place in\r\n\nNovember 1996.\r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r                                            \r\n\nA.  Sentence Reduction Under U.S.S.G.   5G1.32\r                                                         \r\n\n          Senior  contends  that,  pursuant  to  U.S.S.G.    \r\n\n5G1.3(b), the district court should have reduced his sentence\r\n\nto account for  time served in Massachusetts prison beginning\r\n\nSeptember 28, 1995.  He observes that application note two of\r\n\nU.S.S.G.   5G1.3(b) requires  courts to reduce a  sentence by\r\n\nthe  period of  imprisonment already  served  as a  result of\r\n\nconduct  taken into  account  in the  sentence.   He  further\r\n\nasserts that his  case fits within  this proviso because  his\r\n\ntime served  since September 28,  1995 resulted from  a state\r\n\nconviction  that the district court used  to enhance his base\r\n\noffense level from 8 to 24.\r\n\n          At the outset, Senior faces an uphill climb because\r\n\nthis argument  is raised for  the first time  on appeal.   We\r\n\ntherefore review only for plain  error.  See United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nTaylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 972 (1st Cir. 1995).  We may  find plain\r                  \r\n\nerror only if  the error \"skewed the  fundamental fairness or\r\n\nbasic  integrity  of  the  proceeding  below  in  some  major\r\n\nrespect.\"  Id. at 973.  And we may correct such an error only\r                          \r\n\nif \"a  miscarriage of justice  would otherwise result.\"   Id.\r                                                                         \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.   All references are to the 1995 version of the sentencing\r\nguidelines, which indisputably apply here.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\n(citing  United  States v.  Frady,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110693\"><a href=\"/opinion/110693/united-states-v-frady/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>  <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 163  n.14\r                                             \r\n\n(1982)).\r\n\n          Senior's   argument   overlooks   the   fact   that\r\n\napplication note 2 of U.S.S.G   5G1.3(b) is triggered only by\r\n\na district  court determination  that the  Bureau of  Prisons\r\n\nwill  not credit a federal  sentence with time already served\r\n\nfor  conduct taken into account in determining the guidelines\r\n\nrange.   See U.S.S.G.    5G1.3, comment.  (n. 2).   Here, the\r                        \r\n\npresentence  report indicates that the Bureau of Prisons will\r\n\nreduce Senior's  sentence for  his time  served beginning  on\r\n\nSeptember  28, 1995.   The  district  court, by  implication,\r\n\nadopted this  conclusion, and  Senior does  not contest  it.3\r\n\nRather, Senior does not allege  that his time served will not\r\n\nproperly  be credited  by  the Bureau  of Prisons;  he merely\r\n\nseeks,  by  another means,  what  he is  already  destined to\r\n\nreceive.  Thus, we find no error, let alone plain error.\r\n\nB.  Alleged Error in Applying U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(d)\r                                                             \r\n\n          Senior contends, in his pro se supplemental  brief,\r                                                    \r\n\nthat  the  district  court  should  not  have  increased  his\r\n\ncriminal  history category  by two  points  under U.S.S.G.   \r\n\n4A1.1(d) because he was not under a criminal justice sentence\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.    Indeed, Senior recognized in his brief: \"Although there\r\nis some indication  in the record that the  Bureau of Prisons\r\nwould deal with  the matter of  the credit to  be awarded  to\r\ndefendant, the defendant was entitled by the clear mandate of\r\nthe   guideline  and  commentary  to  the  reduction  of  his\r\nsentence.\"  Id.\r                           \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nat the time of the instant offense.  Questions such as  this,\r\n\nwhich involve the  applicability of  a sentencing  guideline,\r\n\nare  reviewed by this  court de novo.   See  United States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRuiz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197202\"><a href=\"/opinion/197202/united-states-v-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1504 (1st Cir. 1997).  \r                \r\n\n          Senior correctly  states that  U.S.S.G.    4A1.1(d)\r\n\napplies only  if the  instant offense  occurred while he  was\r\n\nunder a criminal justice sentence.   He then argues that this\r\n\nguideline does  not apply because the execution of his arrest\r\n\nwarrant in 1995  occurred after the scheduled  discharge date\r\n\nof his parole.  Therefore, in his view, two points should not\r\n\nhave been added to his criminal history category.\r\n\n          Senior  mistakenly  perceives  his  arrest  on  the\r\n\nMassachusetts  warrant as the relevant offense.  The relevant\r\n\noffense, i.e., the  one for which he was  sentenced, is being\r\n\nillegally in this country without the consent of the Attorney\r\n\nGeneral, 8 U.S.C.   1326.   Senior's argument thus rests on a\r\n\nfaulty premise.  \r\n\n          At any  rate, whether  we look to  the date  of his\r\n\nunlawful reentry (in  April 1992) or of his  apprehension (on\r\n\nMarch 15, 1996), Senior was under a criminal justice sentence\r\n\nat either time.  It seems obvious that, in April 1992, Senior\r\n\nwas  still on  parole for  his 1989  possession offense,  and\r\n\nthat, on March 15, 1996, Senior was still imprisoned for that\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nparole  violation.4   Accordingly, we  find  no error  in the\r\n\ndistrict court's application of U.S.S.G.   4A1.1(d).\r\n\nC.  Downward Departure for Agreeing to be Deported\r                                                              \r\n\n          Lastly,  Senior argues  that  the district  court's\r\n\ndecision  not to grant a downward  departure for his agreeing\r\n\nto be deported  is reviewable because it was  not an exercise\r\n\nof discretion but a ruling based on  a mistaken understanding\r\n\nof  the law.   Senior  further asserts  that, because  of its\r\n\nmistaken  understanding that it  could not depart,  the court\r\n\ndid not consider the facts or merits of his request.\r\n\n          A district  court's discretionary  decision not  to\r\n\ndepart  below   the  guideline   sentencing   range  is   not\r\n\nreviewable,  except where  there is  a mistake  of law.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States v. Pierro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195522\"><a href=\"/opinion/195522/united-states-v-pierro/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619 (1st Cir. 1994).\r                                   \r\n\n          We need not  decide whether the district  court had\r\n\nthe authority to grant the requested downward departure.  The\r\n\ndistrict  court made  it  clear  that it  would  not grant  a\r\n\ndownward departure even if it could.  Clearly, this statement\r\n\nbelies  Senior's contention that  the court did  not consider\r\n\nthe   merits  of  his  argument  for  a  downward  departure.\r\n\nMoreover,  it renders utterly  harmless any mistaken  view of\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.   We  look to  both the date  of reentry  and the  date of\r\napprehension  because the  indictment did  not charge  Senior\r\nwith  unlawful reentry; it only charged  him with being found\r\nin  the  United  States, without  consent  from  the Attorney\r\nGeneral, following  arrest and  deportation.  Because  Senior\r\nwas under a criminal justice  sentence on both dates, we need\r\nnot decide which is applicable.\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\nthe  law harbored by  the court.   Therefore, even if  we had\r\n\njurisdiction to entertain this argument, we would reject it.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed\r                              \r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n</pre>",
