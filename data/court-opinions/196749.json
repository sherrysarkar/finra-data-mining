Jo-Jo alerted  to nine other suitcases within  a short\r\n\ntime  thereafter.   All ten  bags were  bound for  New York  City\r\n\naboard American Airlines Flight 678.  Several bags bore Carreras'\r\n\nname and address.   Other luggage tags  designated either Nereida\r\n\nR os-Sol , Mar a Ort z, or  Mar a Due o-Ort z, who were traveling\r\n\nwith Carreras.   Although appellant  John Cruz was  booked aboard\r\n\nFlight 678 as well, his name did not appear on any baggage tag. \r\n\n          With  assistance  from  American   Airlines  personnel,\r\n\nCustoms agents located Carreras and the three women on Flight 678\r\n\nas  it was  preparing to  depart for  New York.   After  the four\r\n\npassengers  had deplaned, Customs  agents examined their boarding\r\n\npasses and quickly looked  through Carreras' briefcase.  Although\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nall  four were  detained,  and  interrogated intermittently  over\r\n\nseveral hours, they did not consent to a search of their suitcas-\r\n\nes  or acknowledge possession of  any contraband.   Nor were they\r\n\nformally  placed under  arrest.   Finally, at  around  8:30 p.m.,\r\n\nafter obtaining  a search warrant,  government agents  discovered\r\n\napproximately  20 kilograms of cocaine in each suitcase.  At that\r\n\npoint,  Carreras  was given  Miranda  warnings  and placed  under\r                                              \r\n\narrest.\r\n\n          In due  course, Carreras  moved to  suppress admissions\r\n\nmade  during  his extended  detention,  as well  as  the physical\r\n\nevidence seized  by Customs.   Following  a three-day  hearing, a\r\n\nmagistrate judge  recommended suppression of  all the  challenged\r\n\nevidence  except  the cocaine  seized  from the  suitcases.   The\r\n\ndistrict court  later ordered the Carreras admissions suppressed,\r\n\nbut  declined to suppress the  cocaine and the  items seized from\r\n\nthe Carreras briefcase.   United States v. Carreras,  851 F.Supp.\r                                                             \r\n\n502, 505-06 (D.P.R. 1994).\r\n\n          On  September 20,  1994,  the district  court issued  a\r\n\nfinal scheduling order,  setting October 24,  1994, as the  trial\r\n\ndate and  directing that  all  \"[d]ispositive motions,  including\r                                                                           \r\n\nmotions to  suppress, . .  . be filed  not later than  October 5,\r                                                                          \r\n\n1994.  There-after  they shall not be  entertained.  See Fed.  R.\r                                                                  \r\n\nCr. P. 12(b).\" (emphasis added).  On October 5, Carreras' present\r\n\ncounsel  mailed a second motion to suppress  from New York to San\r                         \r\n\nJuan, which was not  filed with the district court  until October\r                                                                           \r\n\n11.    The belated  motion challenged  the  legality of  the \"dog\r            \r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nsniff\" and the practice of commingling domestic and international\r\n\nluggage  at the Airport.  In accordance with its final scheduling\r\n\norder, the district court declined to consider the  second motion\r\n\nto  suppress,  deeming its  claims  waived.   Trial  commenced on\r\n\nOctober 24, 1994, as scheduled.\r\n\n                                II\r                                          II\r\n\n                            DISCUSSION\r                                      DISCUSSION\r                                                \r\n\nA.

The Carreras Appeal\r                                 \r\n\n          Carreras attempts  to resuscitate the claims  raised in\r\n\nthe second  motion to suppress, despite the  undisputed fact that\r\n\nhe failed  to comply with the bar date.  See McIntosh v. Antonio,\r                                                                          \r\n\n71 F.3d 29, 35-37  (1st Cir. 1995) (\"filing\" occurs  upon receipt\r\n\nby clerk,  not upon mailing, per  Fed. R. Civ. P.  5(e)); Fed. R.\r\n\nCrim. P. 49(d) (incorporating  civil case filing rule).   Nor did\r\n\nCarreras  either request an extension  of the bar  date or invoke\r\n\nCriminal  Rule 12(f),  which explicitly  authorizes the  district\r\n\ncourt to grant relief from  waiver for cause shown.  See  Fed. R.\r                                                                  \r\n\nCrim.  P. 12(f);  see also United  States v.

Cf. United States v.

Thus, the  government did  not  need to  demonstrate a\r\nparticularized suspicion to justify  Jo-Jo's use in detecting the\r\ncocaine inside the Carreras luggage.  United States v. Maldonado-\r                                                                           \r\nEspinosa,  968 F.2d 101, 103  (1st Cir. 1992),  cert. denied, 507\r                                                                      \r\nU.S. 984 (1993).   Furthermore, Jo-Jo's \"alert\" to the  ten suit-\r\ncases bound for  New York  City provided probable  cause for  the\r\nwarrant which  authorized the search that  disclosed the cocaine.\r\nId.   Similarly,  the challenge  to the  second briefcase  search\r             \r\nfails, since  Carreras neither points to  any evidence introduced\r\nagainst  him as  a result  of  the first  cursory  search of  the\r\nbriefcase,  nor suggests a plausible legal basis for finding that\r\nthe subsequent seizure of the briefcase and its contents, immedi-\r\nately  after he was placed under arrest, was not entirely reason-\r\nable under  any  of several  exceptions to  the Fourth  Amendment\r\nwarrant requirement.  See, e.g., Illinois v. Lafayette, 462  U.S.\r                                                                \r\n640, 645-46 (1983) (inventory  search); Chimel v.

See, e.g.,  United States  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nDiMarzo, Nos.  95-1441 &amp; 1442,  1996 WL  159365, at *2  (1st Cir.\r                 \r\n\nApr. 10, 1996).

Neither the Carreras\r\n\nclosing argument nor the  Carreras cross-examination of a govern-\r\n\nment witness generated a significant  risk of unfair prejudice to\r\n\nCruz.   See United  States v.

The jury,  employing its common\r\n\nsense  in evaluating  the circumstantial  evidence, fairly  could\r\n\nconclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Cruz knew the suitcases\r\n\ncontained  cocaine, see United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir.  1992) (equating direct  and circumstantial  evidence),\r\n\ncert.  denied,  506 U.S.  1063  (1993),  and that  all  essential\r                       \r\n\nelements of  the crimes charged  had been  duly established,  see\r                                                                           \r\n\nDiMarzo,  1996  WL 159365,  at  *4-5  (rejecting \"mere  presence\"\r                 \r\n\ndefense).  \r\n\n          Viewed in  the light most favorable  to the government,\r\n\nsee  id. at *4,  the evidence showed that  Carreras and Cruz were\r                 \r\n\nclose associates  who had agreed  to meet in  Puerto Rico and  to\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ntransport  a large  quantity  of cocaine  to  New York  City  for\r\n\ndistribution  on the  mainland.   Cruz played  an active  role in\r\n\nplanning, financing, and carrying out the operation.  Among other\r\n\nthings,  he supplied the ten  suitcases in which  the cocaine was\r\n\ncarried and hired two women in Miami to travel with him to Puerto\r\n\nRico,  assist in checking the  ten suitcases at  the Airport, and\r\n\nfly on to  New York.   Cruz and these  two female associates  met\r\n\nCarreras at the  Airport upon  their arrival from  Miami the  day\r\n\nbefore their scheduled flight to New York City.  Later  that eve-\r\n\nning, Cruz guarded the  fully-loaded suitcases in Carreras' hotel\r\n\nroom while Carreras went out to dinner.  Immediately prior to the\r\n\nscheduled  flight to New York  the next day,  Carreras filled out\r\n\nluggage tags and placed bogus agricultural inspection stickers on\r\n\nthe cocaine-laden suitcases to circumvent x-ray monitoring at the\r\n\nAirport.  Significantly,  since his  name did not  appear on  the\r\n\nluggage tags, and  he was traveling to New York  under an assumed\r\n\nname, Cruz was able to avoid detection at the Airport even though\r\n\nthe ten suitcases had been found to contain cocaine.  \r\n\n          Finally, even though the trial record plainly discloses\r\n\nthat he was  afforded effective assistance by  able trial counsel\r\n\nat sentencing,  Cruz contends  that the district  court sentenced\r\n\nhim  in an  unconstitutional  manner by  denying his  last-minute\r\n\nrequest for a continuance of the sentencing hearing to permit new\r\n\ncounsel,  who  apparently  was  handling other  criminal  matters\r\n\nagainst  Cruz in  Ohio, to  represent him  at sentencing  in this\r\n\ncase.  The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nthe  late request for continuance.   See United  States v. Betan-\r                                                                           \r\n\ncourt-Arretuche, 933  F.2d 89, 93  (1st Cir.), cert.  denied, 502\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 959 (1991).\r\n\n          The  district court originally scheduled sentencing for\r\n\nFebruary 3, 1995, but reset it for February 8 after Cruz request-\r\n\ned  a continuance on January 18.  Despite this accommodation, for\r\n\nno apparent reason  Cruz' stateside counsel  failed to appear  on\r\n\nFebruary 8,  nor did  he ever  enter an  appearance in  the case.\r\n\nInstead, at the February 8  sentencing hearing Cruz requested yet\r\n\nanother continuance on the ground that his stateside counsel  was\r\n\nunavailable.  The district court acted well within its discretion\r\n\nin calling a  halt to these \"cat and mouse\"  tactics.  See United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.

Jo-Jo alerted to nine other suitcases within a short time thereafter.   All ten bags were bound for New York City aboard American Airlines Flight 678.   Several bags bore Carreras' name and address.   Other luggage tags designated either Nereida Rios-Sola, Maria Ortiz, or Maria Dueno-Ortiz, who were traveling with Carreras.   Although appellant John Cruz was booked aboard Flight 678 as well, his name did not appear on any baggage tag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With assistance from American Airlines personnel, Customs agents located Carreras and the three women on Flight 678 as it was preparing to depart for New York.  After the four passengers had deplaned, Customs agents examined their boarding passes and quickly looked through Carreras' briefcase.   Although all four were detained, and interrogated intermittently over several hours, they did not consent to a search of their suitcases or acknowledge possession of any contraband.   Nor were they formally placed under arrest.   Finally, at around 8:30 p.m., after obtaining a search warrant, government agents discovered approximately 20 kilograms of cocaine in each suitcase.   At that point, Carreras was given Miranda warnings and placed under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Carreras moved to suppress admissions made during his extended detention, as well as the physical evidence seized by Customs.   Following a three-day hearing, a magistrate judge recommended suppression of all the challenged evidence except the cocaine seized from the suitcases.   The district court later ordered the Carreras admissions suppressed, but declined to suppress the cocaine and the items seized from the Carreras briefcase.  United States v. Carreras, 851 F.Supp. 502, 505-06 (D.P.R.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 20, 1994, the district court issued a final scheduling order, setting October 24, 1994, as the trial date and directing that all \"[d]ispositive motions, including motions to suppress, ... be filed not later than October 5, 1994.   There-after they shall not be entertained.   See Fed.  R. Cr. P. 12(b).\"  (emphasis added).   On October 5, Carreras' present counsel mailed a second motion to suppress from New York to San Juan, which was not filed with the district court until October 11.   The belated motion challenged the legality of the \"dog sniff\" and the practice of commingling domestic and international luggage at the Airport.   In accordance with its final scheduling order, the district court declined to consider the second motion to suppress, deeming its claims waived.   Trial commenced on October 24, 1994, as scheduled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Carreras Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carreras attempts to resuscitate the claims raised in the second motion to suppress, despite the undisputed fact that he failed to comply with the bar date.  See McIntosh v. Antonio, 71 F.3d 29, 35-37 (1st Cir.1995) (\"filing\" occurs upon receipt by clerk, not upon mailing, per Fed.R.Civ.P. 5(e));  Fed.R.Crim.P. 49(d) (incorporating civil case filing rule).   Nor did Carreras either request an extension of the bar date or invoke Criminal Rule 12(f), which explicitly authorizes the district court to grant relief from waiver for cause shown.   See Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(f);  see also United States v. Nunez, 19 F.3d 719, 722-23 (1st Cir.1994) (noting importance of deciding motions to suppress before trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the failure to present the district court with any reason for the waiver, Carreras' claim that the district court abused its discretion, see United States v. Gomez-Benabe, 985 F.2d 607, 611 (1st Cir.1993), by enforcing its scheduling order and imposing waiver, is utterly frivolous, see id.   Accordingly, we do not reach the lame arguments--first broached on appeal--for his \"abuse of discretion\" claim.  Appeal of Sun Pipe Line Co., 831 F.2d 22, 25 (1st Cir.1987) (refusing to find abuse of discretion based on matters never presented to district court), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1055 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carreras also attempts to broach on appeal a Fifth and Sixth Amendment challenge to the jury selection procedures employed below, by arguing that higher income professionals, non-voters, and non-English speaking persons are systematically exempted or excluded from petit jury service in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  We hold this claim to have been forfeited for failure to interpose a proper objection below, United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 326 (1st Cir.1995) (refusing relief absent showing of \"manifest\" or \"clear\" injustice);  see also 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1867(a) (1994);  United States v. Pion, 25 F.3d 18 (1st Cir.1994), and substantially foreclosed by our precedent as well.  See, e.g., Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 326 (upholding English-language requirement);  United States v. Benmuhar, 658 F.2d 14, 19-20 (1st Cir.1981) (finding no \"systematic\" exclusion of professionals), cert. denied, 447 U.S. 1117 (1982);  see also United States v. Cecil, 836 F.2d 1431, 1448-49 (4th Cir.)

See United States v. Catucci, 55 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.1995).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Cruz Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant Cruz contends that it was error for the district court to deny a pretrial motion for severance under Fed.R.Crim.P. 14, whereby he alerted the court that codefendant Carreras would deny ownership of the suitcases containing cocaine and \"point the finger\" at Cruz.  On appeal, Cruz maintains that his fears were realized because he was unfairly convicted as a result of the antagonistic defenses presented at the joint trial.   We review only for manifest abuse of discretion.

Cruz has not shown that the joint trial either jeopardized a specific trial right or risked an unreliable verdict.  See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 538-39 (1993) (discussing examples of prejudice).   Neither the Carreras closing argument nor the Carreras cross-examination of a government witness generated a significant risk of unfair prejudice to Cruz.  See United States v.

Cruz played an active role in planning, financing, and carrying out the operation.   Among other things, he supplied the ten suitcases in which the cocaine was carried and hired two women in Miami to travel with him to Puerto Rico, assist in checking the ten suitcases at the Airport, and fly on to New York.  Cruz and these two female associates met Carreras at the Airport upon their arrival from Miami the day before their scheduled flight to New York City.  Later that evening, Cruz guarded the fully-loaded suitcases in Carreras' hotel room while Carreras went out to dinner.   Immediately prior to the scheduled flight to New York the next day, Carreras filled out luggage tags and placed bogus agricultural inspection stickers on the cocaine-laden suitcases to circumvent x-ray monitoring at the Airport.   Significantly, since his name did not appear on the luggage tags, and he was traveling to New York under an assumed name, Cruz was able to avoid detection at the Airport even though the ten suitcases had been found to contain cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, even though the trial record plainly discloses that he was afforded effective assistance by able trial counsel at sentencing, Cruz contends that the district court sentenced him in an unconstitutional manner by denying his last-minute request for a continuance of the sentencing hearing to permit new counsel, who apparently was handling other criminal matters against Cruz in Ohio, to represent him at sentencing in this case.   The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the late request for continuance.  See United States v. Betancourt-Arretuche, 933 F.2d 89, 93 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 959 (1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court originally scheduled sentencing for February 3, 1995, but reset it for February 8 after Cruz requested a continuance on January 18.   Despite this accommodation, for no apparent reason Cruz' stateside counsel failed to appear on February 8, nor did he ever enter an appearance in the case.   Instead, at the February 8 sentencing hearing Cruz requested yet another continuance on the ground that his stateside counsel was unavailable.   The district court acted well within its discretion in calling a halt to these \"cat and mouse\" tactics.  See United States v.

Betancourt-Arretuche, 933 F.2d at 93 (citation omitted).  \" 'Only an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay violates the right to the assistance of counsel,' and would amount to an abuse of [the district court's] discretion.\"  United States v. Brand, No. 94-1350, 1996 WL 121716, at * 3 (1st Cir.  Mar. 26, 1996) (quoting Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1983)).   Cruz was given ample opportunity to secure stateside counsel but failed to explain his failure to do so.   Consequent ly, denial of the second request for continuance, made at the rescheduled sentencing hearing and without any reasonable assurance to the district court that further delay was either warranted--since able trial counsel was available--or likely to ensure the appearance of stateside counsel, was eminently sound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Moreover, the claims raised in the second suppression motion were frivolous.  Cf. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-33 (1993) (Criminal Rule 52 contemplates, at threshold, that appellant establish \"error\");  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).   First, as Carreras concedes, a \"dog sniff\" is not a Fourth Amendment \"search.\"  See, e.g., United States v. De Los Santos Ferrer, 999 F.2d 7, 10 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 562 (1993).   Thus, the government did not need to demonstrate a particularized suspicion to justify Jo-Jo's use in detecting the cocaine inside the Carreras luggage.  United States v. Maldonado-Espinosa, 968 F.2d 101, 103 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 984 (1993).   Furthermore, Jo-Jo's \"alert\" to the ten suitcases bound for New York City provided probable cause for the warrant which authorized the search that disclosed the cocaine.   Id. Similarly, the challenge to the second briefcase search fails, since Carreras neither points to any evidence introduced against him as a result of the first cursory search of the briefcase, nor suggests a plausible legal basis for finding that the subsequent seizure of the briefcase and its contents, immediately after he was placed under arrest, was not entirely reasonable under any of several exceptions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.  See, e.g., Illinois v. Lafayette, 462 U.S. 640, 645-46 (1983) (inventory search);  Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969) (search incident to arrest);  Maldonado-Espinosa, 968 F.2d at 104 (inevitable discovery);  see also Wong Sun v.

Jo-Jo alerted to nine other suitcases within a short time thereafter.   All ten bags were bound for New York City aboard American Airlines Flight 678.   Several bags bore Carreras' name and address.   Other luggage tags designated either Nereida Rios-Sola, Maria Ortiz, or Maria Dueno-Ortiz, who were traveling with Carreras.   Although appellant John Cruz was booked aboard Flight 678 as well, his name did not appear on any baggage tag.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With assistance from American Airlines personnel, Customs agents located Carreras and the three women on Flight 678 as it was preparing to depart for New York.  After the four passengers had deplaned, Customs agents examined their boarding passes and quickly looked through Carreras' briefcase.   Although all four were detained, and interrogated intermittently over several hours, they did not consent to a search of their suitcases or acknowledge possession of any contraband.   Nor were they formally placed under arrest.   Finally, at around 8:30 p.m., after obtaining a search warrant, government agents discovered approximately 20 kilograms of cocaine in each suitcase.   At that point, Carreras was given Miranda warnings and placed under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Carreras moved to suppress admissions made during his extended detention, as well as the physical evidence seized by Customs.   Following a three-day hearing, a magistrate judge recommended suppression of all the challenged evidence except the cocaine seized from the suitcases.   The district court later ordered the Carreras admissions suppressed, but declined to suppress the cocaine and the items seized from the Carreras briefcase.  United States v. Carreras, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

There-after they shall not be entertained.   See Fed.  R. Cr. P. 12(b).\"  (emphasis added).   On October 5, Carreras' present counsel mailed a second motion to suppress from New York to San Juan, which was not filed with the district court until October 11.   The belated motion challenged the legality of the \"dog sniff\" and the practice of commingling domestic and international luggage at the Airport.   In accordance with its final scheduling order, the district court declined to consider the second motion to suppress, deeming its claims waived.   Trial commenced on October 24, 1994, as scheduled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Cruz was given ample opportunity to secure stateside counsel but failed to explain his failure to do so.   Consequent ly, denial of the second request for continuance, made at the rescheduled sentencing hearing and without any reasonable assurance to the district court that further delay was either warranted--since able trial counsel was available--or likely to ensure the appearance of stateside counsel, was eminently sound.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Moreover, the claims raised in the second suppression motion were frivolous.  Cf. United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732-33 (1993) (Criminal Rule 52 contemplates, at threshold, that appellant establish \"error\");  see also Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(a).   First, as Carreras concedes, a \"dog sniff\" is not a Fourth Amendment \"search.\"  See, e.g., United States v. De Los Santos Ferrer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611605\"><a href=\"/opinion/611605/united-states-v-maria-e-de-los-santos-ferrer/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></span> (1993).   Thus, the government did not need to demonstrate a particularized suspicion to justify Jo-Jo's use in detecting the cocaine inside the Carreras luggage.  United States v. Maldonado-Espinosa, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586285\"><a href=\"/opinion/586285/united-states-v-jose-maldonado-espinosa-and-carmen-maldonado-espinosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">968</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.1992), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">984</span></span> (1993).   Furthermore, Jo-Jo's \"alert\" to the ten suitcases bound for New York City provided probable cause for the warrant which authorized the search that disclosed the cocaine.   Id. Similarly, the challenge to the second briefcase search fails, since Carreras neither points to any evidence introduced against him as a result of the first cursory search of the briefcase, nor suggests a plausible legal basis for finding that the subsequent seizure of the briefcase and its contents, immediately after he was placed under arrest, was not entirely reasonable under any of several exceptions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement.

Lafayette, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110976\"><a href=\"/opinion/110976/illinois-v-lafayette/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span>, 645-46 (1983) (inventory search);  Chimel v.
