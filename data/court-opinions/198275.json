Edward F. Harrington, U.S. District Judge]\n\n                          Before\n\n                 Boudin, Circuit Judge,\n             Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\n               and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n Mark J. Gillis on brief for appellant.\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Kevin P. McGrath,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition for\nappellee.\n\nJanuary 6, 1999\n\n        Per Curiam.    The United States has moved for\nsummary disposition in this direct criminal appeal, contending\nthat the only issue presented is a claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel.  As such, the government argues, we must\ndismiss the appeal and direct defendant George P. Asamoah to\nfile a motion under 28 U.S.C.  2255.  A careful reading of the\nbrief prepared by defendant's appellate attorney, however,\nreveals that counsel is not making such a claim.  Further, the\ngovernment ignores the pro se supplemental brief filed by\ndefendant.  In this brief, defendant raises four other claims\nthat are appropriate for direct appeal.  We therefore address\nthese claims now.\n          1.  Colloquy Regarding Right to Testify\n          In Siciliano v. Vose, 834 F.2d 29 (1st Cir. 1987), we\nheld that the Constitution does not require a trial judge, sua\nsponte, to personally address a criminal defendant, to explain\nto that defendant that he or she has the right to testify, and\nto ascertain that the defendant chooses to waive that right. \nId. at 30.  Other courts of appeals agree.  See United Statesv. Ortiz, 82 F.3d 1066, 1071 (D.C. Cir. 1996); United States v.\nPennycooke, 65 F.3d 9, 11 (3rd Cir. 1995); Ortega v. O'Leary,\n843 F.2d 258, 261 (7th Cir. 1988).  Thus, we held, \"a criminal\ndefendant must claim his privilege or right to testify by\nattempting to take the stand or it is waived.\"  Siciliano, 834\nF.2d at 30 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n                             -2-\n          Here, defendant was silent all through the trial. \nFurther, nothing in the trial record gives any indication of\nproblems in the attorney-client relationship.  Indeed, in this\nrespect, we note that during opening argument, defendant's\ntrial attorney plainly stated, and presumably defendant heard,\nthat defendant \"may or may not testify here.\"  See id. (noting\nthat defendant had heard the trial judge state that defendant\n\"may testify\").  Rather, defendant waited until sentencing,\nwhere he made the following statement: \"[M]y lawyer made it\nknown to me that he is the one who has to review the facts of\nwhat is happening to the Court, and that I have no right to get\non the stand, and there was no point for me to say anything.\"\n          Under Siciliano, defendant's statement was not enough\nto obligate Judge Harrington to conduct a colloquy regarding\ndefendant's waiver of the right to testify.  That is, defendant\ndid not \"attempt to take the stand\" at trial, which is when\nSiciliano requires that a defendant assert the right.  SeeSiciliano, supra.  Further, defendant waited until the\ndisposition hearing on June 11, 1997   over three months afterthe trial had ended   to raise the question.  Finally, we add\nthat defendant still can litigate this issue if he, in fact,\nfiles a  2255 motion claiming ineffective assistance regarding\nhis trial attorney's alleged advice that he could not testify.\n          2.  Stipulation Regarding the Amount of Heroin\nCarried by Co-defendant Emelia Dadzie\n          At the beginning of trial, the prosecutor read into\nthe record an agreement entered into by defendant and the\ngovernment in which they stipulated that the heroin seized from\nDadzie weighed 816.3 grams and was from 76% to 82% pure.  Judge\nHarrington did not ask defendant whether he personally had\nagreed to this stipulation.  Defendant now maintains that the\nlack of a colloquy on this point violated his due process\nrights.\n          The cases defendant cites in support of this\nargument, however, are inapposite.  Rather, they all concern\nstipulations or admissions of prior convictions in the context\nof sentence enhancements.  See, e.g., Johnson v. Cowley, 40\nF.3d 341, 346 (10th Cir. 1994) (holding that a remand was\nrequired where defendant's state trial counsel had stipulated\nto defendant's prior conviction and there was no evidence in\nthe record that defendant had agreed to the stipulation);\nGovernment of the Virgin Islands v. George, 741 F.2d 643, 648\n(3rd Cir. 1984) (under the Virgin Islands procedure for\nsentencing habitual criminals, the trial court, before asking\na defendant whether he or she has been previously convicted,\n\"must inquire into, and make a determination of, the\ndefendant's understanding of the consequences of that\nadmission); Cox v. Hutto, 589 F.2d 394 (8th Cir. 1979) (per\ncuriam).  Even were we to consider adopting a Cox-type rule, it\nwould not apply here.\n          First, the stipulation regarding the weight of the\ncocaine carried by Dadzie plainly was not the \"functional\nequivalent of a guilty plea\"   i.e, it did not leave the trial\ncourt with nothing to do but enter judgment and impose\nsentence.  Further, the stipulation directly concerned Dadzie,\nnot defendant.  That is, the government still had to prove that\ndefendant was connected to Dadzie and to the cocaine she had\nimported into this country.  Given this, we cannot see that any\nof defendant's rights were violated by the stipulation in this\ncase.\n          3.  Sentencing Errors\n          a.  Amount of Heroin Used for Sentencing -- 816.3 or\n700 Grams.  Defendant argues that Judge Harrington erred by\nusing, for the initial calculation of defendant's base offense\nlevel (BOL), the 816.3 grams of heroin Dadzie had carried in\nJuly 1993.  Rather, defendant contends, the judge should have\nused 700 grams   the amount Dadzie testified that she had been\ntold she would be carrying.  The problem with this argument is\nthat it makes no difference which quantity was used because the\nBOL was the same for both amounts.\n          First, where a crime involves at least 700 grams, but\nless than 1 kilogram, of heroin, the resulting BOL is 30. \nU.S.S.G.  2D1.1(c)(5).  Thus, 700 grams and 816.3 grams yield\nthe same result.  Further, when the additional 500 grams of\nheroin is added to either amount -- for a total amount of 1200\nand 1316.3 grams respectively, defendant's BOL is 32 for bothamounts.  See id.  2D1.1(c)(4) (at least 1 kilogram of heroin,\nbut less than 3 kilograms of heroin).  Any error, therefore,\nwould be harmless.  See United States v. Young, 78 F.3d 758,\n763 n.4 (1st Cir. 1996).\n          b.  Distribution to Government Agent.  Defendant\nargues that since both Dadzie and co-defendant Eric Sekyere\nwere government agents at the time of most of the events\nunderlying the conspiracy at hand, the heroin carried by Dadzie\non July 24, 1993, should not have been counted at all for\nsentencing purposes.  In support of this argument, defendant\ncites United States v. Reyes, 979 F.2d 1406 (10th Cir. 1992). \nReyes, however, does not have anything to do with whether an\nindividual's status as a government agent affects the amount of\ndrugs which can be attributed to a defendant in calculating his\nor her sentence.  Because defendant cites no other authority\nfor this questionable proposition, his argument must be\nrejected.\n          c.  The Extra 500 Grams of Heroin.  Defendant\ncontends that there was insufficient evidence to connect him to\nDadzie's February 1993 importation of 500 grams of heroin. \n\"Absent a mistake of law, we review only for clear error the\ndistrict court's conclusions that drugs were part of the same\nconduct or scheme or plan.\"  Young, supra, 78 F.3d at 763. \nUnder U.S.S.G.  1B1.3, \"relevant conduct\" includes all acts\n\"that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme\nor plan as the offense of conviction . . . .\"  In order for two\noffenses to be considered part of a common plan or scheme,\n\"they must be substantially connected to each other by at least\none common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices,\ncommon purpose, or similar modus operandi.\"  U.S.S.G.  1B1.3,\ncomment. (n.9(A)).\n          Here, Judge Harrington had the testimony of Dadzie\nthat she had brought heroin into the United States at\ndefendant's behest in February 1993.  That Dadzie knew\ndefendant prior to the July 1993 importation also is\ncorroborated by the testimony of Patrick Barkerswoode that he\nhad introduced defendant to Dadzie in 1991.  The decision to\ncredit the testimony of Dadzie was within Judge Harrington's\n\"exclusive province.\"  See United States v. Conley, 156 F.3d\n78, 85 (1st Cir. 1998).\n          As a result of the foregoing, it is plain that the\nFebruary and July importations involved two common factors: a\ncommon accomplice and a common modus operandi.  Further, as for\ndefendant's argument that the February importation was not\nreasonably foreseeable by him, suffice it to say that \"[a]\ndefendant simply cannot be heard to complain that he could not\nreasonably foresee acts that he himself engineered.\"  Id. \nThere was no clear error, then, in crediting defendant with the\nextra 500 grams of heroin.\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.  SeeLocal Rule 27.1.  Any ineffective assistance claims must be\nraised in a  2255 motion.  See United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d\n1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993) (\"the trial judge, by reason of\nfamiliarity with the case, is usually in the best position to\nassess both the quality of the legal representation afforded to\nthe defendant in the district court and the impact of any\nshortfall in that representation\").\n",
