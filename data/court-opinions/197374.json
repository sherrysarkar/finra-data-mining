S 523(a)(15).\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\npayments  required by  the  parties'  separation  agreement  were\r\n\nnondischargeable.  At trial it was agreed \"that no issues of fact\r\n\nremain in  dispute and  the only issue  before the  court is  the\r\n\ndischargeabil\r                      ity of $33,706.98 in pre-petition attorneys' fees and\r\n\ndisbursements.\"  In re Macy,  192 B.R. 802, 803 (Bankr. D.  Mass.\r\n\n1996).  The plaintiff filed her action within the time prescribed\r\n\nfor 11 U.S.C. S 523(a)(5), but beyond the somewhat shorter period\r\n\nprescribed for 11 U.S.C.  S 523(a)(15).  The parties have  agreed\r\n\nthroughout the litigation, therefore, that if the debt is not  of\r\n\nthe kind  described in 11 U.S.C.  S 523(a)(5), but falls  instead\r\n\nunder section 523(a)(15), then it is dischargeable.\r\n\n          The bankruptcy court held that the attorneys' fees  and\r\n\ndisbursements incurred in connection with the plaintiff's efforts\r\n\nto collect alimony, maintenance, or child support are governed by\r\n\nsection \r                 523(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code and, on the facts of this\r\n\ncase, \r               are \r                   not dischargeable.  Macy, 192 B.R. at 806.  On appeal to\r\n\nthe \r             United \r                   States \r                          District Court for the District of Massachusetts,\r\n\nthe decision was  affirmed.  The debtor-appellant now appeals  to\r\n\nthis \r              court. \r                      \r                      The only issue on appeal is whether section 523(a)(5)\r\n\nor section 525(a)(15)  furnishes a vehicle  for testing the  non-\r\n\ndischargeabil\r                      ity of attorneys' fees incurred by a former spouse in\r\n\nan effort  to  enforce payments  required  by a  divorce  decree.\r\n\nHolding that attorneys' fees  incurred by a former spouse in  the\r\n\ncourse of seeking to enforce support-related payments required by\r\n\na divorce  decree are properly  nondischargeable under 11  U.S.C.\r\n\nS 523(a)(5), we affirm.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n          We find that  the reasoning of  the decisions below  is\r\n\nsound, \r                and \r                    affirm for substantially the reasons put forth therein.\r\n\nSee Macy v. Macy, 200 B.R. 467, 468-69 (Bankr. D. Mass. 1996); In\r\n\nre Macy, 192 B.R. at 802-03.  See generally Lawton v. State  Mut.\r\n\nLife Assurance Co., 101 F.3d 218, 220 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[W]hen  a\r\n\nlower court produces a comprehensive, well-reasoned decision,  an\r\n\nappellate court should refrain from writing at length to no other\r\n\nend than  to hear  its own  words resonate\").   We  add only  the\r\n\nfollowing brief discussion.\r\n\n          The  foundation of  appellant's  argument is  that  the\r\n\nBankruptcy \r                    Reform Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-394, 108 Stat. 4106\r\n\n(1994), by adding section  523(a)(15), has impliedly amended  the\r\n\nappropriate interpretation of section 523(a)(5), changing the way\r\n\nin  which attorneys' fees  should be classified.   By its  terms,\r\n\nsection 523(a)(15)  includes only debt that  is \"not of the  kind\r\n\ndescribed \r                   in \r                     [section \r                              523(a)](5).\"  Furthermore, it is not disputed\r\n\nthat prior to the enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, fees of\r\n\nthe sort at issue were nondischargeable under section  523(a)(5).\r\n\nSee\r            , \r              e.g.\r                  , \r                    In \r                      re \r                         Coleman,\r                                  37 B.R. 120, 123 (Bankr. W.D. Wisc. 1984)\r\n\n(\"There has  been virtual unanimity  among bankruptcy courts  and\r\n\nappellate courts . . . that attorney's fees incurred by a  spouse\r\n\nare nondischargeable so long as the primary debt is excepted from\r\n\ndischarge.\")  The question, therefore, is whether the  Bankruptcy\r\n\nReform Act had the effect of removing attorneys' fees of the sort\r\n\nat issue here from the reach of section 523(a)(5).\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          A \r                     review \r                            of \r                              existing \r                                       case law and the legislative history\r\n\nof section 523(a)(15) leads us to the conclusion that  attorneys'\r\n\nfees continue to  be governed by section  523(a)(5).  There is  a\r\n\nstrong policy interest in protecting ex-spouses and children from\r\n\nthe loss of alimony, support and maintenance owed by a debtor who\r\n\nhas \r             filed \r                  for \r                      bankruptcy.  See Shine v. Shine, 802 F.2d 583, 585-88\r\n\n(1st Cir.  1986).  This policy  is emphasized in the  legislative\r\n\nhistory of section 523(a)(15), which reads:\r\n\n               This section  is intended  to  provide\r\n            greater    protection    for     alimony,\r\n            maintenance, \r                                  and support obligations owing\r\n            to a spouse, former spouse, or child of a\r\n            debtor in bankruptcy. . . .\r\n\n               [Section  523(a)(15)]   adds   a   new\r\n            exception \r                               to \r                                  discharge for some debts that\r\n            are  not  in   the  nature  of   alimony,\r\n            maintenance   or  support.      In   some\r\n            instances, divorcing spouses have  agreed\r\n            to \r                        make \r                             payments of marital debts, holding\r\n            the  other  spouse  harmless  from  those\r\n            debts, in  exchange  for a  reduction  in\r\n            alimony \r                             payments.  In other cases, spouses\r\n            have agreed to  lower alimony based on  a\r\n            larger \r                            property settlement.  If such \"hold\r\n            harmless\"   and    property    settlement\r\n            obligations are not  found to  be in  the\r\n            nature  of   alimony,   maintenance,   or\r\n            support,  they  are  dischargeable  under\r\n            current \r                             law. \r                                   The non-debtor spouse may be\r\n            saddled with substantial debt and  little\r\n            or no alimony  or support.  This  section\r\n            will      make      such      obligations\r\n            nondischargeable. . . .\r\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 103-835 at S 304 (1994).  This legislative  history\r\n\ndemonstrates that Congress sought to apply section 523(a)(15)  to\r\n\ndebts that had previously been construed as property obligations.\r\n\nSee, e.g., In re  Kritt, 190 B.R. 382,  385 n.4 (9th Cir.  B.A.P.\r\n\n1995) (\"Section  523 has subsequently been  amended to add a  new\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nsection 523(a)(15), which provides that property settlements  are\r\n\nnow generally  nondischargeable  in bankruptcy.\")   There  is  no\r\n\nindication  that  Congress   intended  to   affect  the   liberal\r\n\ninterpretation of  section  523(a)(5).   It follows,  then,  that\r\n\nCongress did not intend to apply section 523(a)(15) to debts that\r\n\nwere, prior to the  Bankruptcy Reform Act, considered to be  non-\r\n\ndischargeable under section 523(a)(5).\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\n",
