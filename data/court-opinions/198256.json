DICKINSON,\r\n\n                  Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                            v.\r\n\n               MICHAEL J. CHITWOOD, ET AL.,\r\n\n                  Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n       APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\r\n\n         [Hon. Gene Carter, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Selya, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Norman E. Dickinson on brief pro se.\r\n Mark E. Dunlap and Norman, Hanson &amp; DeTroy, LLC on brief for\r\nappellees Michael Chitwood and City of Portland.\r\n Edward R. Benjamin, Jr. and Thompson &amp; Bowie on brief for\r\nappellees Michael Kelly and City of Lewiston.\r\n\nDecember 17, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Plaintiff-appellant Norman Dickinson\r\nappeals pro se from the grant of summary judgment in favor of\r\ndefendants on his federal claims and the dismissal without\r\nprejudice of his state law claims.  For the following reasons,\r\nwe affirm.\r\n          Dickinson is a Maine state prisoner who pled guilty\r\nto kidnapping, robbery, and two counts of criminal threatening\r\nwith a dangerous weapon.  The offenses involved a one-day crime\r\nspree in South Portland, Maine, on February 2, 1989.  Dickinson\r\nis currently incarcerated following a revocation of probation. \r\nThe underlying case stems from events that occurred in 1997\r\nafter Dickinson was released from prison and began serving a\r\nterm of probation in Portland, Maine.  On or about the time of\r\nDickinson's release, Portland's chief of police warned the\r\npublic about him and disclosed his address.  Several months\r\nlater, after Dickinson was scheduled to be placed in Lewiston,\r\nMaine, Lewiston's chief of police did much the same thing.\r\n          Based on these actions, Dickinson filed a 42 U.S.C.\r\n 1983 suit against the City of Portland, the City of Lewiston,\r\nand their respective police chiefs alleging violations of his\r\nconstitutional rights to equal protection and due process of\r\nlaw, his right to privacy, and his right to be free of cruel\r\nand unusual punishment.  Although he did not articulate this\r\ntheory in his complaint, Dickinson argued in his later filings\r\nthat municipal liability attached because the two cities'\r\nrespective  police  chiefs  possessed  final   decisionmaking\r\n                             -2-\r\nauthority with respect to the actions taken.    See Pembaur v.\r\nCity of Cincinnati, 475 U.S. 469, 481 (1986) (concluding that\r\na final decisionmaker's single decision may, in some\r\ncircumstances, give rise to municipal liability under  1983). \r\nIn addition to his federal claims, Dickinson alleged various\r\nclaims under state law.\r\n   It is undisputed that, approximately ten months\r\nbefore he began his probationary term, Dickinson wrote the\r\nsentencing judge a letter in which he described himself as a\r\n\"time bomb.\"  He suggested that the restrictions imposed by the\r\njudge, which essentially amounted to house arrest, would be the\r\n\"spark that sets that bomb off.\"  He asked a rhetorical\r\nquestion, \"Will being confined in my house prevent me from\r\ncommitting a violent act,?\" and answered, \"No.\"\r\n   It is also undisputed that, approximately four months\r\nbefore his release, Dickinson wrote a letter to a Portland\r\ntelevision news reporter identifying himself as the person \"who\r\nwent on a crime spree in South Portland on February 2, 1989.\" \r\nHe stated that he was writing to inform the reporter and\r\n\"society\" that he would be back on the streets of Portland on\r\nJanuary 26, 1997.  He further stated that he would be \"meaner\r\nthan ever\" and that he \"pit[ied] anyone who [got] in [his]\r\nway.\"  The letter indicated that Dickinson was enclosing a\r\npolice report of the February 1, 1989 incidents.\r\n   We review the grant of summary judgment de novo. \r\nHinchey v. NYNEX Corp., 144 F.3d 134, 140 (1st Cir. 1998).  In\r\ndoing so, we are not limited to the district court's reasoning\r\nbut may affirm on any independently sufficient ground.  Medina-\r\nMunoz v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir.\r\n1990).  In the instant case, we affirm because we conclude that\r\nDickinson has failed to establish a violation of his\r\nconstitutional rights.\r\n   In particular, we affirm the district court's\r\ndisposition as to the Eighth Amendment claim on the ground\r\nthat, even if we were to assume for the sake of argument that\r\ndefendants' actions could constitute punishment, Dickinson has\r\nmade no argument on appeal that these actions constitute \"cruel\r\nand unusual\" punishment.  We reject as without merit\r\nDickinson's suggestion in the district court that punishment is\r\ncruel and unusual if it is more burdensome than necessary.  Cf.Taylor v. Rogers, 781 F.2d 1047, 1050 (4th Cir. 1986) (finding\r\nno cruel and unusual punishment where protective custody\r\nrestrictions were \"rationally related\" to security and\r\nprotection concerns).\r\n   Dickinson's equal protection argument also fails. \r\nClassification that neither abridges a fundamental right nor\r\noperates against a suspect class receives rational basis\r\nreview.  Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Rouse, 129 F.3d 649,\r\n660 (1st Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 2366 (1998). \r\nDickinson makes no argument that defendants' actions are\r\nsubject to heightened scrutiny.  His only argument is that\r\ndefendants acted \"arbitrarily\" in disclosing his address to\r\nmembers of the public but not the addresses of other released\r\nfelons.  However, given Dickinson's threats and warnings during\r\nthe months before his release, defendants had a legitimate\r\nbasis for treating him differently than other recently released\r\nfelons.  In short, Dickinson has made no showing that the\r\npolice treated his case disparately from any comparable case.\r\n   Finally, we think that on the facts of this case\r\nDickinson's right to privacy and due process arguments fail. \r\nAs an initial matter, Dickinson has made no persuasive argument\r\nthat Maine's Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act,\r\nwhich does not apply to him, nonetheless creates a protectible\r\nliberty interest entitling him to due process protections.  We\r\nneed not decide, in the abstract, whether the confidentiality\r\nbranch of the constitutional right to privacy prohibits the\r\ndisclosure of information about a released felon, including\r\nsuch information as his name, address, and convictions.  Cf.Vega-Rodriguez v. Puerto Rico Tel. Co., 110 F.3d 174, 183 (1st\r\nCir. 1997) (indicating that the range has not extended beyond\r\nprohibiting profligate disclosure of medical, financial, and\r\nother intimately personal data).  In the instant case,\r\nDickinson himself \"published\" a compilation of information\r\nabout himself, just a few months before his release date, in\r\nthe form of the letter to the Portland television news\r\nreporter.    Having himself initiated a warning to \"society,\"\r\nDickinson is not in a position to complain about an invasion of\r\nhis right to privacy or the lack of a hearing before the\r\ndissemination of information.  Cf. Doe v. City of New York, 15\r\nF.3d 264, 269 (2d Cir. 1994) (recognizing that the right to\r\nprivacy can be waived).\r\n We need go no further.    Because the district court\r\nproperly dismissed the federal claim, it did not err in\r\ndismissing the state law claims.  See 28 U.S.C.  1367(c)(3). \r\nAffirmed.\r\n",
