Juan M. Prez-Gimnez, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                   Boudin, Circuit Judge,\r\n\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n\n            and Reavley*, Senior Circuit Judge.\r\n\n        Fernando L. Gallardo, with whom Woods &amp; Woods was on\r\nbrief for appellant.\r\n\n        Jaime E. Toro-Monserrate, with whom Ral M. Arias, and\r\nMcConnell Valdes were on brief for appellees.\r\n\nOctober 16, 1998\r\n\n                 \r\n\n   *Of the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.  BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  The sole issue in this\r\ncase is whether the trial court erred when it dismissed this action\r\nfor breach of contract and fraud.  We affirm the district court\r\nopinion, which we have reviewed de novo.\r\n                              I.\r\nIn the latter part of 1995, plaintiff-appellant Ikbal\r\nGaibi Rodrguez (\"Gaibi\") and defendant-appellees Emergent Group,\r\nInc., Emergent Mortgage Corp., and Carolina Investors, Inc.\r\n(collectively, \"Emergent\"), entered into negotiations to establish\r\na strategic alliance to provide one another with certain financial\r\nservices.  On December 5, 1995, the parties executed a\r\nConfidentiality Agreement to govern their discussions.  That\r\nagreement provided, inter alia, that \"[n]one of the Parties shall\r\nhave any duty of obligation whatsoever to proceed with any\r\ntransaction unless and until a definite, written agreement has been\r\nmutually approved, executed, and delivered to both parties.\" \r\nNegotiations over the details of the venture continued.  \r\nAt some point, the negotiations centered on the possible\r\ncreation of a corporation   preliminarily called the \"Emergent\r\nLending Puerto Rican Company\" or the \"Puerto Rico Lending\r\nInstitution\"   that would then employ Gaibi.  On June 1, 1996,\r\nGaibi allegedly discontinued other business endeavors and attended\r\ntraining sessions at Emergent's offices for three weeks and\r\ncontinued to work on aspects of the venture.  On June 20, 1996,\r\nEmergent informed Gaibi that it had decided to withdraw from its\r\ndealings with him.  The corporation was never created.  Gaibi was\r\nreimbursed $2,132.24 \"for the expenses [he] incurred while visiting\r\n[Emergent].\"  (7/9/96 letter from Donald L. Batts to Gaibi).  In\r\naddition, he was paid \"three months salary ($25,000) for the time\r\nand effort [he] extended working on developing the Emergent Lending\r\nPuerto Rican company.\"  This was to \"help cover [his] expenses and\r\nprovide for the transition into [his] new employment.\" \r\n                             II.\r\nThis lawsuit followed.  In his complaint, Gaibi alleged:\r\n(1) breach of the Confidentiality Agreement because defendants\r\nfailed to develop the Puerto Rican Lending Institution and misused\r\ntheir relatively more substantial \"economic wealth\"; (2) breach of\r\nan alleged Development Agreement; (3) breach of good faith and fair\r\ndealing by fraudulently refusing to develop the corporation; and\r\n(4) breach of an alleged Employment Agreement.  Defendants moved to\r\ndismiss for failure to state a claim or, in the alternative, to\r\ntransfer the case to the District of South Carolina.  \r\nThe trial court granted the motion to dismiss.  It\r\ndismissed the Confidentiality Agreement claim because Gaibi did not\r\nallege any facts suggesting that defendants misused the information\r\nthey gained during negotiations or otherwise failed to negotiate in\r\ngood faith; and dismissed the remaining claims because it found no\r\nwritten Development or Employment Agreements.  The court dismissed\r\nthe fraud claim on the ground that the complaint contained only\r\nconclusory assertions but no facts upon which a finding of fraud\r\ncould be based.\r\n                             III.\r\nOn appeal, Gaibi contends that: (1) there had to have\r\nbeen an Agreement because he attended training sessions, was paid\r\nthree months' salary, and had begun working for the Emergent\r\nLending Puerto Rican Company, which was \"developed, at least de\r\nfacto\"; (2) the parties did \"proceed with [a] transaction,\" thereby\r\nrendering the Confidentiality Agreement's requirement for a written\r\nagreement inapplicable; and (3) the court erred by failing to\r\nconvert the motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment.\r\nAs to his breach of contract claims, although Gaibi\r\nsubmitted several letters which he contends represent codified\r\nagreements, none of them are.  See K-Mart v. Davis, 756 F. Supp.\r\n62, 68-69 (D.P.R. 1991).  For example, the letter dated April 8,\r\n1998 from Keith B. Giddens of Emergent to Gaibi does not contain\r\nthe \"terms and conditions of [his] Employment Contract,\" as Gaibi\r\ncontends, but is simply evidence of ongoing negotiations: the\r\nletter employs conditional language such as, \"If I am correct, you\r\nwill own . . .\" and \"Other provisions will have to include . . . .\" \r\nSimilarly, the document Gaibi calls evidence of his acceptance of\r\nthe purported Employment Agreement (4/16/96 letter from Gaibi to\r\nGiddens) is no more than his agreement to the \"basic concept\" of\r\nthe current proposal and includes further suggestions by Gaibi.  In\r\nshort, Gaibi simply cobbles together various circumstances that may\r\nor may not be consistent with the existence of a contract, but\r\nwhich in light of the Confidentiality Agreement's demand for a\r\nwritten agreement are clearly insufficient to form a contractual\r\nmeeting of the minds.  \r\nThat Gaibi voluntarily forewent other business\r\nopportunities, and that Emergent compensated him for the time spent\r\non the project and trained him in the hope that the project would\r\nmaterialize, does not satisfy this contractual requirement. \r\nLikewise, we find no merit to Gaibi's argument that the parties had\r\nexplicitly waived or modified the terms of the Confidentiality\r\nAgreement.\r\nThe court's dismissal of the fraud claim is also\r\nunassailable.  None of the alleged facts suggest any intent to\r\ndefraud Gaibi or negotiate in bad faith.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). \r\nAnd Gaibi's own complaint suggests that negotiations simply did not\r\npan out.\r\nGaibi's claim that the court should have converted the\r\nmotion to dismiss to one for summary judgment requires only brief\r\ncomment.  He never asked for such a conversion and the court\r\nconsidered only documentary evidence that was crucial to his\r\nclaims, i.e., the Confidentiality Agreement and all documents\r\nsubmitted by plaintiff which purportedly represented Development or\r\nEmployment Agreements but which were clearly correspondence\r\nexchanged during and as part of the negotiations.  There was no\r\nreason for the court to sua sponte convert the motion for dismissal\r\nto one for summary judgment.  See Watterson v. Page, 987 F.2d 1, 3\r\n(1st Cir. 1993); Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).\r\nAffirmed.  Costs on appeal awarded to appellee.\n",
