Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Jose R. Franco on brief for appellants.\n     Pedro J. Manzazno-Yates, Luis F. Colon-Conde and Fiddler,\nGonzalez & Rodriguez on brief and Motion for Summary Disposition\nfor appellees.\n\n\n\n\n                          February 8, 2001\n\f           Per Curiam.    Plaintiffs-appellants appeal from the\n\ndenial of their motion for reconsideration.                 That motion\n\nasked the court to reconsider its denial of plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for an extension of time to submit their opposition\n\nto    defendants’     motion    for   summary      judgment      in   this\n\nemployment discrimination case.           The district court granted\n\nthe    motion   for    summary    judgment        without   considering\n\nplaintiffs’ opposition and denied plaintiffs’ two motions\n\nfor reconsideration.          This appeal is from the denial of\n\nplaintiffs’ second motion for reconsideration.\n\n           I. Background\n\n           Plaintiffs-appellants are five former employees of\n\ndefendant, New Puerto Rico Marine Management, Inc., d/b/a\n\nNPR, Inc. (“NPR”).     All five were discharged from employment\n\nwith NPR as part of a reduction in force which defendants\n\nmaintain was required by a necessary restructuring of the\n\ncompany   following     its    transfer    from    public   to    private\n\nownership.      Plaintiffs’ amended complaint included claims\n\nthat they had been discriminated against based on their age,\n\nethnicity and (in two cases) gender, in violation of the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) and Title VII of\n\nthe Equal Employment Opportunities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e,\n\net seq. (“Title VII”).\n\f            On August 20, 1999, defendants served their motion\n\nfor summary judgment upon plaintiffs.            Before the ten-day\n\ndeadline for opposing the motion had arrived, plaintiffs\n\nfiled a motion asking the court to hold “in abeyance” the\n\ndeadline    for    responding,   to    allow   them    time   to    obtain\n\npreviously-requested          documents         from       defendants.\n\nInterpreting the motion as pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f),\n\nthe district court denied it, but set a new deadline of\n\nOctober 15, 1999, for plaintiffs to file a response to the\n\nsummary judgment motion.      In its order, the court found that\n\nthe documents that plaintiffs had been waiting for had been\n\nproduced by the date of the order (October 1, 1999).                   The\n\ncourt stated that if plaintiffs failed to meet the October\n\n15, 1999 deadline, “the Court will not consider his response\n\nto Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment.”             On October 15,\n\n1999, plaintiffs filed a second request for an extension of\n\ntime, until November 1, 1999, to file their opposition to\n\nthe motion for summary judgment.               The court denied the\n\nextension    and    granted   defendants’       motion    for      summary\n\njudgment without considering plaintiffs’ opposition, which\n\nwas filed with the court on November 5, 1999.\n\n            In their first motion for reconsideration, filed\n\nafter the district court’s grant of defendants’ summary\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fjudgment motion, plaintiffs repeated the arguments they had\n\nincluded in their opposition to the summary judgment motion.\n\nThey argued that the district court had erred in finding\n\nthat plaintiffs could not meet their prima facie burden of\n\nproving discrimination in violation of the ADEA and Title\n\nVII.    They focused primarily on defendants’ failure to meet\n\ntheir    burden      of    demonstrating         a     legitimate,       non-\n\ndiscriminatory      reason   for      the   lay-offs.       Specifically,\n\nplaintiffs concentrated on the argument that there was no\n\nevidence that NPR was in poor financial condition at the\n\ntime of the lay-offs.        In its order denying the motion, the\n\ndistrict court did not address the merits of its decision\n\nbut, instead, stated that it would not consider plaintiffs’\n\narguments    in    opposition    to    summary       judgment   because    of\n\nplaintiffs’ failure to comply with the October 15, 1999\n\ndeadline.\n\n            In    their    second      motion    for     reconsideration,\n\nplaintiffs       argued   that   the    district       court    abused    its\n\ndiscretion in denying its request for an extension of the\n\nOctober 15, 1999 deadline for filing its opposition to the\n\nsummary judgment motion.              They argued that the time to\n\nrespond to the summary judgment motion was insufficient\n\nbecause their attorney is a sole practitioner and the case\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fis complex.      Plaintiffs asked the court to consider the\n\narguments raised in their opposition to the motion for\n\nsummary     judgment    and     in      the     first      motion      for\n\nreconsideration.       The   district    court    denied    the     second\n\nmotion    for   reconsideration,     without     additional    comment.\n\nThis appeal is from that denial only.\n\n           II. Discussion\n\n           Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 6(b), the district court\n\n“for cause shown may at any time in its discretion . . .\n\norder the [time] period [for complying with court-imposed or\n\nother deadlines] enlarged if request therefor is made before\n\nthe expiration of the period originally prescribed or as\n\nextended by a previous order.”                We “afford[] [district\n\ncourts] great leeway in granting or refusing enlargements\n\n[under Rule 6(b)] and its decisions are reviewable only for\n\nabuse of that discretion.” Maldonado-Denis v. Castillo-\n\nRodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 584 (1st Cir. 1994).            The reasoning\n\nbehind our deference is as follows:\n\n           This deference is grounded in common\n           sense.    We deem it self-evident that\n           “appellate courts cannot too readily\n           agree to meddle in such case-management\n           decisions    lest  the  trial   court’s\n           authority is undermined and the systems\n           sputter.”\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fId. (citations omitted).            With respect to a district court’s\n\nrulings on pre-trial discovery matters, this court “will\n\nintervene in such matters ‘only upon a clear showing of\n\nmanifest    injustice,           that   is,     where     the    lower     court’s\n\ndiscovery     order        was     plainly       wrong     and    resulted        in\n\nsubstantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.’” Rodriguez-\n\nCuervos v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 181 F.3d 15, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (citations omitted).\n\n            This     appeal       is    not    from      the    order    granting\n\ndefendant’s summary judgment motion.                      Instead, plaintiffs\n\nhave appealed only from the denial of the second motion for\n\nreconsideration.          A district court’s denial of a motion for\n\nreconsideration is also reviewed deferentially.\n\n            An appellate court ought not to overturn\n            a trial court’s denial of a motion for\n            reconsideration unless a miscarriage of\n            justice is in prospect or the record\n            otherwise reveals a manifest abuse of\n            discretion.\n\nRuiz Rivera v. Riley, 209 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Applying these deferential standards of review, we\n\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its broad\n\ndiscretion in denying the second motion for reconsideration.\n\nUnderlying    that    judgment          is    our   determination        that   the\n\ndistrict     court        did     not    abuse      its    discretion       under\n\nFed.R.Civ.P.       6(b)    in     denying      plaintiffs’       request    for    a\n\n                                        -6-\n\ffurther     extension       of    the     deadline       for   filing         their\n\nopposition to defendants’ summary judgment motion.\n\n            Under Rule 56(c), an adverse party is entitled, at\n\na minimum, to ten days to respond to a summary judgment\n\nmotion. Delgado-Biaggi v. Air Transport Local 501, 112 F.3d\n\n565, 567 (1st Cir. 1997).               The plaintiffs had almost two\n\nmonths to respond.          The record reveals that the documents\n\nthat were the subject of plaintiffs’ Rule 56(f) motion were\n\ndelivered to plaintiffs on September 21, 1999.                       Therefore,\n\nthey still had twenty-four days from the date they received\n\nthose   documents      to     prepare     and     file   their      opposition.\n\nNotwithstanding        that      plaintiffs’       attorney         is    a      sole\n\npractitioner, the following principle applies:\n\n            “[m]ost attorneys are busy most of the\n            time and they must organize their work\n            so as to be able to meet the time\n            requirements   of   matters  they   are\n            handling or suffer the consequences.”\n\nMendez v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 900 F.2d 4, 7 & n.3\n\n(1st Cir. 1990)(quoting Pinero Schroeder v. Federal Nat’l\n\nMortgage Ass’n, 574 F.2d 1117, 1118 (1st Cir. 1978)(per\n\ncuriam)).    There was no abuse of discretion in the district\n\ncourt’s decision to enforce its October 15, 1999 deadline.\n\n            In    determining       that        there    was   no        abuse     of\n\ndiscretion       by   the   district          court,    we   also    note        that\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fplaintiffs do not appear to have been prejudiced by the\n\ndistrict     court’s       refusal    to     consider        their   opposition.\n\nUnder the burden-shifting framework that applies to ADEA and\n\nTitle VII claims, the initial burden is on the plaintiff to\n\nmake a prima facie showing of discrimination. See Woodman v.\n\nHaemonetics Corp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1091 (1st Cir. 1995). Only\n\nif that initial burden is met by plaintiff does the burden\n\nthen shift to defendant to demonstrate a nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for the challenged employment action. See id.\n\n             Here, the district court granted summary judgment\n\non   the    ADEA    and    Title     VII   claims       on    the    ground   that\n\nplaintiff could not meet its initial burden of making a\n\nprima facie showing of discrimination.                       Therefore, it did\n\nnot reach the question of whether defendant had met its\n\nburden of demonstrating a nondiscriminatory reason for the\n\nlay-offs.     In their opposition to summary judgment, however,\n\nplaintiffs did not contest the material facts on which the\n\ncourt      relied   in     concluding      that     plaintiffs        could    not\n\nestablish a prima facie case. See United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico Local Rule 311(12).\n\nInstead, plaintiffs argued that defendants could not meet\n\ntheir      burden     of     demonstrating          a        legitimate,      non-\n\ndiscriminatory       reason    for     the    discharge         of   plaintiffs.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fBecause plaintiffs’ opposition argued that defendants had\n\nnot met their burden while the district court ruled that the\n\nburden never shifted to defendants, plaintiffs were not\n\nprejudiced by the district court’s denial of their motion\n\nfor reconsideration.\n\n         The district court’s order dated January 11, 2000,\n\ndenying plaintiffs’ Second Motion for Reconsideration, is\n\naffirmed. See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                            -9-\n\f",

Plaintiffs-appellants appeal from the\n\ndenial of their motion for reconsideration.                 That motion\n\nasked the court to reconsider its denial of plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for an extension of time to submit their opposition\n\nto    defendants’     motion    for   summary      judgment      in   this\n\nemployment discrimination case.           The district court granted\n\nthe    motion   for    summary    judgment        without   considering\n\nplaintiffs’ opposition and denied plaintiffs’ two motions\n\nfor reconsideration.          This appeal is from the denial of\n\nplaintiffs’ second motion for reconsideration.\n\n           I. Background\n\n           Plaintiffs-appellants are five former employees of\n\ndefendant, New Puerto Rico Marine Management, Inc., d/b/a\n\nNPR, Inc. (“NPR”).     All five were discharged from employment\n\nwith NPR as part of a reduction in force which defendants\n\nmaintain was required by a necessary restructuring of the\n\ncompany   following     its    transfer    from    public   to    private\n\nownership.      Plaintiffs’ amended complaint included claims\n\nthat they had been discriminated against based on their age,\n\nethnicity and (in two cases) gender, in violation of the Age\n\nDiscrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) and Title VII of\n\nthe Equal Employment Opportunities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e,\n\net seq. (“Title VII”).\n\f            On August 20, 1999, defendants served their motion\n\nfor summary judgment upon plaintiffs.            Before the ten-day\n\ndeadline for opposing the motion had arrived, plaintiffs\n\nfiled a motion asking the court to hold “in abeyance” the\n\ndeadline    for    responding,   to    allow   them    time   to    obtain\n\npreviously-requested          documents         from       defendants.\n\nInterpreting the motion as pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f),\n\nthe district court denied it, but set a new deadline of\n\nOctober 15, 1999, for plaintiffs to file a response to the\n\nsummary judgment motion.      In its order, the court found that\n\nthe documents that plaintiffs had been waiting for had been\n\nproduced by the date of the order (October 1, 1999).                   The\n\ncourt stated that if plaintiffs failed to meet the October\n\n15, 1999 deadline, “the Court will not consider his response\n\nto Defendant’s Motion for Summary Judgment.”             On October 15,\n\n1999, plaintiffs filed a second request for an extension of\n\ntime, until November 1, 1999, to file their opposition to\n\nthe motion for summary judgment.               The court denied the\n\nextension    and    granted   defendants’       motion    for      summary\n\njudgment without considering plaintiffs’ opposition, which\n\nwas filed with the court on November 5, 1999.\n\n            In their first motion for reconsideration, filed\n\nafter the district court’s grant of defendants’ summary\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fjudgment motion, plaintiffs repeated the arguments they had\n\nincluded in their opposition to the summary judgment motion.\n\nThey argued that the district court had erred in finding\n\nthat plaintiffs could not meet their prima facie burden of\n\nproving discrimination in violation of the ADEA and Title\n\nVII.

They argued that the time to\n\nrespond to the summary judgment motion was insufficient\n\nbecause their attorney is a sole practitioner and the case\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fis complex.

We deem it self-evident that\n           “appellate courts cannot too readily\n           agree to meddle in such case-management\n           decisions    lest  the  trial   court’s\n           authority is undermined and the systems\n           sputter.”\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fId. (citations omitted).            With respect to a district court’s\n\nrulings on pre-trial discovery matters, this court “will\n\nintervene in such matters ‘only upon a clear showing of\n\nmanifest    injustice,           that   is,     where     the    lower     court’s\n\ndiscovery     order        was     plainly       wrong     and    resulted        in\n\nsubstantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.’” Rodriguez-\n\nCuervos v.

Instead, plaintiffs\n\nhave appealed only from the denial of the second motion for\n\nreconsideration.          A district court’s denial of a motion for\n\nreconsideration is also reviewed deferentially.\n\n            An appellate court ought not to overturn\n            a trial court’s denial of a motion for\n            reconsideration unless a miscarriage of\n            justice is in prospect or the record\n            otherwise reveals a manifest abuse of\n            discretion.\n\nRuiz Rivera v. Riley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198879\"><a href=\"/opinion/198879/ruiz-rivera-v-dept-of-education/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Applying these deferential standards of review, we\n\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its broad\n\ndiscretion in denying the second motion for reconsideration.\n\nUnderlying    that    judgment          is    our   determination        that   the\n\ndistrict     court        did     not    abuse      its    discretion       under\n\nFed.R.Civ.P.       6(b)    in     denying      plaintiffs’       request    for    a\n\n                                        -6-\n\ffurther     extension       of    the     deadline       for   filing         their\n\nopposition to defendants’ summary judgment motion.\n\n            Under Rule 56(c), an adverse party is entitled, at\n\na minimum, to ten days to respond to a summary judgment\n\nmotion.

The plaintiffs had almost two\n\nmonths to respond.          The record reveals that the documents\n\nthat were the subject of plaintiffs’ Rule 56(f) motion were\n\ndelivered to plaintiffs on September 21, 1999.                       Therefore,\n\nthey still had twenty-four days from the date they received\n\nthose   documents      to     prepare     and     file   their      opposition.\n\nNotwithstanding        that      plaintiffs’       attorney         is    a      sole\n\npractitioner, the following principle applies:\n\n            “[m]ost attorneys are busy most of the\n            time and they must organize their work\n            so as to be able to meet the time\n            requirements   of   matters  they   are\n            handling or suffer the consequences.”\n\nMendez v.

There was no abuse of discretion in the district\n\ncourt’s decision to enforce its October 15, 1999 deadline.\n\n            In    determining       that        there    was   no        abuse     of\n\ndiscretion       by   the   district          court,    we   also    note        that\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fplaintiffs do not appear to have been prejudiced by the\n\ndistrict     court’s       refusal    to     consider        their   opposition.\n\nUnder the burden-shifting framework that applies to ADEA and\n\nTitle VII claims, the initial burden is on the plaintiff to\n\nmake a prima facie showing of discrimination. See Woodman v.\n\nHaemonetics Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196019\"><a href=\"/opinion/196019/woodman-v-heamonetics-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1091 (1st Cir. 1995). Only\n\nif that initial burden is met by plaintiff does the burden\n\nthen shift to defendant to demonstrate a nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for the challenged employment action. See id.\n\n             Here, the district court granted summary judgment\n\non   the    ADEA    and    Title     VII   claims       on    the    ground   that\n\nplaintiff could not meet its initial burden of making a\n\nprima facie showing of discrimination.                       Therefore, it did\n\nnot reach the question of whether defendant had met its\n\nburden of demonstrating a nondiscriminatory reason for the\n\nlay-offs.     In their opposition to summary judgment, however,\n\nplaintiffs did not contest the material facts on which the\n\ncourt      relied   in     concluding      that     plaintiffs        could    not\n\nestablish a prima facie case. See United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico Local Rule 311(12).\n\nInstead, plaintiffs argued that defendants could not meet\n\ntheir      burden     of     demonstrating          a        legitimate,      non-\n\ndiscriminatory       reason    for     the    discharge         of   plaintiffs.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fBecause plaintiffs’ opposition argued that defendants had\n\nnot met their burden while the district court ruled that the\n\nburden never shifted to defendants, plaintiffs were not\n\nprejudiced by the district court’s denial of their motion\n\nfor reconsideration.\n\n         The district court’s order dated January 11, 2000,\n\ndenying plaintiffs’ Second Motion for Reconsideration, is\n\naffirmed. See Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                            -9-\n\f</pre>",
