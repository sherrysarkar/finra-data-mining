Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n                 Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                   and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\nDouglas J. Beaton on brief for appellant.\r\nDonald K. Stern, United States Attorney, Donald L. Cabell, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, and Karin L. Raye, Northeastern University\r\nSchool of Law, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                         May 19, 1998\r\n                                                     Per Curiam.  Leo Roderick appeals from the district\r\ncourt order revoking his supervised release and imposing a\r\nsentence of eighteen months' imprisonment to be followed by six\r\nmonths of supervised release.  He challenges both the district\r\ncourt's decision to revoke supervised release and, in a\r\nsupplemental pro se brief, the sentence imposed.  In addition,\r\nhe contends that the district court erred in acquiescing in his\r\nrequest to represent himself.\r\n    In the brief prepared by court-appointed counsel,\r\nRoderick raises a single issue:  that the government failed to\r\nprove by a preponderance of the evidence that Roderick violated\r\none of the alleged conditions of his supervised release. \r\nSpecifically, Roderick argues that the district court erred in\r\nadmitting three letters introduced into evidence by the\r\ngovernment.  Without that evidence, he contends, there was\r\ninsufficient proof that Roderick had violated federal law while\r\non supervised release by making a false statement on his\r\npassport application.\r\n    At a supervised release revocation hearing, \"the\r\nevidence need not satisfy the tests of admissibility set forth\r\nin the Federal Rules of Evidence, which do not apply, . . . but\r\n[,] evidence that does not satisfy those rules must nonetheless\r\nbe reliable.\"  United States v. Portalla, 985 F.2d 621, 622\r\n(1st Cir. 1993).  The district court found that the letters\r\nsatisfied the Federal Rules of Evidence.  Even absent that\r\nfinding, however, the letters' reliability is established by\r\nthe record.  The district court was careful not to rule on the\r\nadmissibility of the letters until there was a basis for\r\nfinding that the letters were written and signed by Roderick. \r\nRoderick's argument, made for the first time on appeal, that\r\nthe letters could not be considered because they were admitted\r\nafter the government finished presenting its evidence has no\r\nbasis in the law.  Moreover, even without the letters, there is\r\nsufficient evidence in the record to \"demonstrate that the\r\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that\r\nthe evidence 'reasonably satisfied' it that the probationer had\r\nin fact violated\" a federal law.  United States v. Czajak, 909\r\nF.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n    Nor do any of the issues raised in Roderick's pro se\r\nbrief entitle him to relief.  The district court properly\r\napplied the sentencing guidelines in calculating Roderick's\r\ncriminal history category at his original sentencing.  That\r\nsame criminal history category applies at sentencing following\r\nrevocation.  See United States Sentencing Guidelines,  7B1.4. \r\nThe supervised release term of six months imposed by the\r\ndistrict court, following revocation and imposition of a prison\r\nsentence, was well within the limits established by 18 U.S.C.\r\n 3583(h).  Finally, Roderick's suggestion that the district\r\ncourt erred in permitting him to represent himself at the\r\nrevocation hearing is entirely without support.  The transcript\r\nof the hearing belies Roderick's claim that he was under the\r\ninfluence of drugs.  The record demonstrates that the district\r\ncourt fulfilled its obligation to \"address the defendant on the\r\nrecord to assure that he 'knows what he is doing and [that] his\r\nchoice is made with his eyes open.'\"  United States v. Mateo,\r\n950 F.2d 44, 50 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting Faretta v. California,\r\n422 U.S. 806, 835 (1975)).  Nor did the court err in deferring\r\nto the Marshals Service's judgment that Roderick should remain\r\nin restraints during the hearing.  See United States v. Zuber,\r\n118 F.3d 101, 103 (2d Cir. 1997).\r\n    The district court's order dated October 15, 1997, is\r\naffirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\n",
