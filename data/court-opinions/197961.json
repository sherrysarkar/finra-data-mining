HINCHEY,\r\n\n                 Plaintiff, Appellant,\r\n\n                           v.\r\n\n                NYNEX CORPORATION, and \r\n           TELESECTOR RESOURCES GROUP, INC.,\r\n\n                 Defendants, Appellees.\r\n\n      APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\r\n\n           FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\r\n\n   [Hon. George A. O'Toole, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n        Bownes and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges,\r\n\n            and Stearns*, District Judge.\r\n\nKevin M. Akre for appellant.\r\nBarry A. Guryan, with whom, Michael J. Tuteur, Karen K. Burnsand Epstein, Becker &amp; Green, P.C., and Amy B. Seifer, Counsel, Bell\r\nAtlantic Corporation, were on brief for appellees.\r\n\nMay 20, 1998\r\n\n                    \r\n\n*Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation.  BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.  Plaintiff John A. Hinchey \r\nbrought this diversity action against his former employer, NYNEX\r\nCorporation (\"NYNEX\") and Telesector Resources Group, Inc. (\"TRG\")\r\nfor damages arising from his alleged wrongful termination. \r\nSpecifically, plaintiff's claims include breach of contract,\r\npromissory estoppel, intentional misrepresentation, fraud and\r\ndeceit, negligent misrepresentation, intentional and negligent\r\ninfliction of emotional distress, and wrongful discharge in\r\nviolation of public policy.  It is Massachusetts substantive law\r\nthat controls.  The district court judge granted defendants' motion\r\nfor summary judgment, based primarily on his determination that\r\nplaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence on any of his\r\nseventeen claims to warrant a jury trial.  We affirm.\r\n                          I.\r\n                         Facts     Viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party\r\n(Hinchey), the following facts are treated as undisputed for\r\npurposes of summary judgment.  See Dubois v. United States Dep't of\r\nAgric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1284 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117 S.\r\nCt. 2510 (1997).  \r\nIn October 1965, plaintiff Hinchey began working for New\r\nEngland Telephone as a candidate for the Initial Management\r\nDevelopment Program (\"IMDP\").  After working in various technical\r\nmanagement positions and receiving positive evaluations, Hinchey\r\nwas promoted in 1982 and became responsible for Corporate\r\nCommunications.  From August 1991 until April 1993, he was an\r\nacting Assistant Vice President.  At the time of his termination,\r\nHinchey held the position of Director of Technical Support in the\r\nInformation Services Organization within TRG.\r\nOn April 15, 1983, the Company distributed its Code of\r\nBusiness Conduct (\"1983 Code\" or \"the Code\") to all employees.  The\r\npurpose of the Code was to acquaint employees with the Company's\r\n\"core values\" and ethical standards.  In essence, these values and\r\nstandards amounted to an espousal of responsible and legal behavior\r\non the part of employees and the Company.  The 1983 Code also\r\nincluded a non-retaliation provision which assured an employee\r\nprotection against reprisal for reporting violations of the Code. \r\nAll employees were required to acknowledge their assent to the\r\nprovisions of the Code with a signature.  Because Hinchey believed\r\nthat the Code, once signed, would be a binding document, he added\r\nthe following statement before signing it:\r\nI love the Bell System and New England Tel[]\r\nCo[], but I am not \"satisfied\" with my\r\nprogress to date and cannot, in conscience[,]\r\nfully support all existing interpretations of\r\ncorporate policy.  Therefore I cannot exclude\r\nthe possibility of initiating external review\r\nof these concerns and situations.  However, my\r\nobjective continues to be to work toward the\r\nbetterment of the Company as well as myself.  \r\n\nEd McCauley, Hinchey's supervisor at the time, was aware of\r\nHinchey's intention to add the statement.  He was uncertain,\r\nhowever, how it would be interpreted by upper-level management and\r\ncautioned Hinchey to carefully consider his decision to add it.  In\r\nthe end, Hinchey added the statement and considered it to be a\r\nnegotiated-for exception to portions of the Code which prohibit\r\npublic disclosure of company policies or practices.  Despite the\r\nadded statement, Hinchey thought the non-retaliation provision\r\nstill applied to him.  In fact, he believed that the added\r\nstatement solidified his perception that the Code was a binding\r\ncontract between the Company and himself.\r\nNYNEX revised its Code of Business Conduct in 1992 and\r\n1993, adding, inter alia, a statement expressly disclaiming any\r\ncontractual obligations.  Although Hinchey received copies of the\r\n1992 and 1993 codes, he did not question the Company's right to\r\nalter the substance of the 1983 Code.  Rather, Hinchey continued to\r\nassume that his added statement to the 1983 Code was in effect and\r\nprovided him a contractual exception to the corporate policy of\r\nconfining complaints within the Company's framework.  \r\nIn January 1992, NYNEX implemented a Force Management\r\nPlan (\"FMP\") to regulate force reduction procedures for management\r\npersonnel.  Once a force surplus is perceived, the FMP outlines a\r\ndetailed procedure by which to identify employees in the surplus\r\njob categories and assess them against defined criteria.  A\r\nSupervisor's Guide was issued to all management to assist in the\r\ndownsizing process.  The FMP contained an explicit disclaimer:\r\nThe FMP Guidelines are not inflexible, do not\r\nconstitute a contract of employment, and\r\nshould not be interpreted as creating a\r\ncontract of employment, either expressed or\r\nimplied.  The employment relationship between\r\nthe Corporation and its management employees\r\nis by mutual consent (employment-at-will), and\r\nmay be terminated by either the Corporation or\r\nthe employee at any time for any reason\r\n. . . .  These guidelines may be changed\r\nunilaterally by the Corporation at any time\r\nand for any reason . . . .  Nothing in these\r\nguidelines should be interpreted as a\r\nlimitation, either expressed or implied, on\r\nthe Corporation's right to discharge or\r\notherwise discipline its employees.\r\n\nNYNEX Force Management Plan Resource Guide.  Despite the\r\ndisclaimer, Hinchey believed that the FMP had been followed in all\r\nforce reductions that he knew of and that it therefore was a\r\n\"mandatory and binding procedure\" which would be followed in the\r\nfuture.\r\nOn May 5, 1992, Hinchey began discussions with his direct\r\nsupervisor, Vice President Joseph Castellano, regarding \"business\r\nand procurement irregularities\" allegedly perpetrated by NYNEX. \r\nHinchey complained that he had observed a \"pattern of negligence\r\nand closed-mindedness\" within NYNEX for twenty-five years that he\r\nthought clearly violated the Code of Business Conduct.  Hinchey\r\nasserts that Castellano made no attempt to address his concerns or\r\nend the irregularities.\r\nIn early 1993, Hinchey received his performance appraisal\r\nfor 1992.  Despite mostly positive feedback, he received what he\r\nconsidered to be a negative evaluation in the \"Communication\"\r\ncategory.  Hinchey knew that such an evaluation might lead to\r\ntermination under the FMP, so he approached Castellano on\r\nFebruary 24, 1993, to talk about a voluntary separation plan for\r\nhimself.  Hinchey's proposed plan included, inter alia, a\r\nstipulation that he would receive two years \"net credited service\"\r\nin return for his voluntary separation.  \"Net credited service\"\r\nrefers to the number of years an employee has worked at NYNEX.  The\r\nCompany's retirement plan specified that an employee with less than\r\nthirty years of service to the Company (i.e., thirty years of net\r\ncredited service) at the time of retirement would be subjected to\r\na pension reduction.  Because he had been employed at NYNEX for\r\nonly twenty-eight years, his separation proposal included a\r\nstipulation that he would be given two extra years of net credited\r\nservice in order to ensure a full pension.  Castellano told Hinchey\r\nthat he would consider his proposal.  Hinchey heard nothing further\r\nabout his plan for several months.\r\nOn July 19, 1993, Hinchey called Ivan Seidenberg, Vice-\r\nChairman of NYNEX, to schedule an appointment during which Hinchey\r\ncould discuss his allegations of irregularities.  One hour later,\r\nHinchey received a phone call from Castellano, during which\r\nCastellano stated, \"Of course you can talk with Ivan [Seidenberg]\r\nif you wish but I have worked out just what you want.\"  Hinchey\r\nresponded, \"Joe [Castellano], that's not what I want, that's what\r\nI said I would accept back in February.\"  He also said, \"Now you\r\nhave demoted me and have ruined my career and now you've ruined my\r\nreputation and unless I get a permanent promotion I am going to\r\ntalk it over with Ivan.  I don't understand why you couldn't have\r\njust talked with me and have been straight with me.\"  Pl.'s Aff.\r\ndated July 10, 1997, at 10.  \r\nOn August 5, 1993, Hinchey met with Castellano and was\r\nterminated.  Hinchey's termination papers indicated that he was\r\ndischarged under the FMP.  At that meeting, Hinchey was told by\r\nCastellano that he would receive the net credited service he had\r\nrequested, even if it had to be paid out of departmental funds. \r\nCastellano instructed Hinchey to see William Coffey, Director of\r\nNYNEX's Human Resources Department, to \"work it out.\"  When Hinchey\r\nspoke to Coffey, however, Coffey stated that a grant of net\r\ncredited service could not be provided within the framework of an\r\nFMP termination, but that he would work on it with Castellano.  On\r\none or two other occasions, Castellano reasserted his promise to\r\nHinchey, telling him to submit a voucher for the net credited\r\nservice.  When Hinchey submitted a voucher to Castellano, however,\r\nCastellano sent it back to him with a note explaining that he\r\nneeded to see Coffey regarding this issue.  Hinchey never received\r\nthe two years net credited service that Castellano promised he\r\nwould receive.  \r\nSubsequent to his termination, Hinchey canceled his\r\nscheduled meeting with Seidenberg.  He persisted, however, in\r\ntrying to set up a conference with Seidenberg.  In December,\r\nSeidenberg finally met with Hinchey, but Hinchey asserts that the\r\none and a half hour meeting did not provide sufficient time to\r\ncover all of his concerns.  As a result, Hinchey sent Seidenberg a\r\nseries of letters with attachments detailing the company policies\r\nand practices with which he was concerned.  During this time,\r\nHinchey was also in contact with Bill Pucci, NYNEX's Managing\r\nDirector - Office of Business Conduct.  Pucci informed Hinchey\r\nthat, in an effort to settle the matter, Seidenberg would be\r\nwilling to offer him a short-term position as a consultant, two\r\nyears of net credited service equivalent in an annuity, and access\r\nto an executive placement service.  Hinchey responded that the\r\nproposal did not offer what he considered to be appropriate\r\ncompensation considering the damage his reputation had suffered. \r\nHinchey later stated to Pucci, \"I would consider a million dollars\r\nappropriate if they hired me back, and . . . if I'm left with\r\nnothing, no reputation, 10 million dollars wouldn't be enough.\" \r\nHinchey Dep. dated February 13, 1997, at 97.  Although Hinchey\r\nindicated that these dollar amounts were not \"hard numbers,\" no\r\nfinal agreement between Hinchey and Seidenberg was reached, and\r\nHinchey consequently brought this lawsuit.\r\n                         II.\r\n\n                   Standard of Review\r\nWe review the district court's grant of summary judgment\r\nde novo.  See Dubois, 102 F.3d at 1283.  Summary judgment may be\r\ngranted only when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the\r\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\r\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\r\nas a matter of law.\"  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).  \"[T]he mere existence\r\nof some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat\r\nan otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment. . . .\" \r\nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). \r\nRather, to be considered material, a disputed fact must have the\r\npotential to \"affect the outcome of the suit under the governing\r\nlaw.\"  Id. at 248.\r\nThe party moving for summary judgment, here the Company,\r\nbears the initial burden of demonstrating that there are no genuine\r\nissues of material fact for trial.  See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\r\n477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986).  This burden \"may be discharged by\r\n'showing'   that is, pointing out to the district court   that\r\nthere is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's\r\ncase.\"  Id. at 325.  After such a showing, the \"burden shifts to\r\nthe nonmoving party, with respect to each issue on which he has the\r\nburden of proof, to demonstrate that a trier of fact reasonably\r\ncould find in his favor.\"  DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 306\r\n(1st Cir. 1997) (citing Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322-25).  \r\nIn the end, upon examining the facts in the light most\r\nfavorable to the nonmoving party and drawing all reasonable\r\ninferences in his favor, see Dubois, 102 F.3d at 1284, we are\r\nrequired to determine if \"there is sufficient evidence favoring the\r\nnonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.\" \r\nAnderson, 477 U.S. at 249.\r\n                         III.\r\n              Breach of Contract Claims\r\nHinchey's brief is somewhat unclear as to what alleged\r\nagreements he is referring to in asserting his breach of contract\r\nclaims.  As we understand it, he has asserted that three binding\r\ncontracts between him and NYNEX were in existence:  the 1983 Code,\r\nthe FMP, and the oral promise of net credited service.  \r\nA. Code of Business Conduct and Force Management Plan\r\nIt is well settled in Massachusetts that employment is\r\npresumed to be at-will unless there exists an express or implied\r\ncontract governing its terms and conditions.  See Jackson v. Action\r\nfor Boston Community Dev., Inc., 525 N.E.2d 411, 412 (Mass. 1988). \r\nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") has determined\r\nthat a personnel manual may, in some cases, form the basis of such\r\na contract.  See O'Brien v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 664 N.E.2d\r\n843, 847 (Mass. 1996) (citing Jackson, 525 N.E.2d at 415); see alsoHobson v. McLean Hosp. Corp., 522 N.E.2d 975, 977 (Mass. 1988).\r\nThere is no explicit test or \"rigid list of\r\nprerequisites\" to aid in ascertaining if a personnel manual\r\ncomprises a binding contract under Massachusetts law.  O'Brien, 664\r\nN.E.2d at 847.  Rather, factfinders must consider several factors\r\nrecently articulated by the SJC in Jackson, 525 N.E.2d 411, which\r\nheld that no implied contract based on the terms of the personnel\r\nmanual existed where: 1) the employer retained the right to\r\nunilaterally modify terms; 2) the terms of the manual were not\r\nnegotiated; 3) the manual stated that it provided only guidance\r\nregarding the employer's policies; 4) no term of employment was\r\nspecified in the manual; 5) the employee did not sign the manual to\r\nmanifest assent.  Id. at 415-16.  The SJC has clarified that these\r\nfactors are not an inflexible list, but rather a set of\r\ncircumstances which would \"make a difference or might make a\r\ndifference in deciding whether the terms of a personnel manual were\r\nat least impliedly part of an employment contract.\"  O'Brien, 664\r\nN.E.2d at 847.  Stated another way, these factors help determine if\r\nan employee could reasonably have believed that the \"employment\r\nmanuals he or she was given constituted the terms or conditions of\r\nemployment, equally binding on employee and employer.\"  Derrig v.\r\nWal-Mart Stores, Inc., 942 F. Supp. 49, 55  (D. Mass. 1996) (citing\r\nO'Brien, 664 N.E.2d at 848-49).\r\nThe first issue is whether it was objectively reasonable\r\nfor Hinchey to believe that the terms of the 1983 Code comprised\r\nmutually binding contractual obligations.  The added statement, \r\nessentially declaring that Hinchey did not assent to the full terms\r\nof the Code, did not make the Code mutually binding.  His assertion\r\nthat the added statement constituted a negotiated-for exception to\r\nthe Code is based on an assumption that has no legal or factual\r\nfoundation.  Hinchey has produced no evidence showing or tending to\r\nshow that McCauley (the supervisor present when the statement was\r\nadded) had actual authority to negotiate exceptions to the 1983\r\nCode.  Nor was there any evidence of apparent authority, which\r\n\"'results from conduct by the principal which causes a third person\r\nreasonably to believe that a particular person . . . has authority\r\nto enter into negotiations or to make representations as his\r\nagent.'\"  Linkage Corp. v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 679 N.E.2d\r\n191, 203 (Mass.), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 599 (1997) (alteration\r\nin original) (quoting Hudson v. Massachusetts Property Ins.\r\nUnderwriting Ass'n, 436 N.E.2d 155, 159 (Mass. 1982)).\r\nFurthermore, even if McCauley had possessed authority to\r\nnegotiate a contractual exception to the Code, there is no evidence\r\nthat any real negotiations occurred.  Hinchey himself testified in\r\na deposition that his supervisor counseled against adding the\r\nstatement.  That Hinchey added it anyway does not demonstrate that\r\na negotiation about the terms of the Code took place.  In addition,\r\nthe ambiguous language of the statement cannot be read as an\r\nexemption to a specific provision.  Rather, the statement appears\r\nto be a general exception allowing Hinchey the opportunity to\r\ndecide in the future whether or not he will abide by the Code. \r\nAccordingly, we find that no rational juror could conclude that it\r\nwas objectively reasonable for Hinchey to believe that the 1983\r\nCode was mutually binding on him and the Company.\r\nHinchey's claim regarding the breach of the FMP also\r\nfails as a matter of law.  Hinchey asserts that there is a disputed\r\nissue of material fact regarding whether proper FMP procedures were\r\nfollowed prior to his termination.  We need not reach that issue,\r\nhowever, because we find that the FMP contained no binding\r\ncontractual obligations.  There is simply a dearth of evidence in\r\nthe record supporting Hinchey's contention that he reasonably\r\nbelieved the FMP was a \"mandatory and binding procedure.\"  Clearly,\r\nthere was no negotiation regarding the terms of the manual, nor was\r\nthere a term of employment specified within it.  Further, there was\r\nan explicit disclaimer, in which NYNEX retained the right to\r\nunilaterally modify the FMP.  Hinchey, by his own assertion, was\r\nextremely knowledgeable of the FMP and proficient in its\r\nimplementation.  Accordingly, a rational juror could only conclude\r\nthat Hinchey's awareness of the disclaimer, in addition to the\r\nabsence of any negotiation or specified term of employment, made it\r\nunreasonable for him to claim the FMP as a source of contractual\r\nrights.  \r\n                B. Net Credited Service Hinchey asserts that the Company's oral promise (made by\r\nCastellano) to give him two years of net credited service was a\r\ncontractually binding agreement.  To survive summary judgment on\r\nthis claim, Hinchey must provide evidence sufficient for a\r\nreasonable juror to find that he proved each element of the\r\ncontract.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322.  We examine first the\r\nfactual foundation for Hinchey's oral contract claim.\r\nStripped to their essentials, the facts are as follows. \r\nHinchey proposed to Castellano that he would retire voluntarily if\r\nhe were given two years net credited service so as to bring his\r\ntwenty-eight years of service up to thirty years, thus giving him\r\na full pension.  Six months later, Castellano told Hinchey that he\r\nhad \"worked out just what you want.\"  Hinchey rejected this offer\r\nand told Castellano that he wanted a permanent promotion.  Hinchey\r\nmet with Castellano a month later and was terminated under the FMP.\r\nHe was told by Castellano that he would receive the two years net\r\ncredited service.  There is no doubt that Hinchey was given the\r\nrun-around by Castellano and Coffey when he attempted to obtain the\r\nnet credited service.  This, however, did not deter him from\r\npursuing Seidenberg, Vice-Chairman of NYNEX.  He was also in\r\ncontact with Pucci, Director of NYNEX's Office of Business Conduct. \r\nPucci told him that Seidenberg was willing to offer him a short-\r\nterm position as a consultant, two years of net credited service\r\nequivalent in an annuity and access to an executive placement\r\nservice.  Hinchey rejected this offer and later told Pucci that he\r\n\"would consider a million dollars appropriate, if they hire me\r\nback.\"\r\nHinchey rejected the two oral offers made by the Company,\r\nupping the ante each time.  Clearly, there was no meeting of the\r\nminds and hence no contract.  See Jamestown Portland Cement Corp.v. Bowles, 117 N.E. 41, 43 (Mass. 1917).\r\nMoreover, there could be no oral contract because of the\r\nfailure of consideration by Hinchey.  The promises relied upon by\r\nHinchey were made after his termination.  \"[I]n order for a\r\ncontract to have valid consideration, the contract must be a\r\nbargained-for exchange in which there is a legal detriment of the\r\npromisee or a corresponding benefit to the promisor.\"  Frankina v.\r\nFirst Nat'l Bank of Boston, 801 F. Supp. 875, 886 (D. Mass. 1992),\r\naff'd, 991 F.2d 786 (1st Cir. 1993) (citing Graphic Arts Finishers,\r\nInc. v. Boston Redevelopment Auth., 255 N.E.2d 793, 795 (Mass.\r\n1970)).  Legal detriment means \"'giving up something which\r\nimmediately prior thereto the promisee was privileged to retain, or\r\ndoing or refraining from doing something which he was then\r\nprivileged not to do, or not to refrain from doing.'\"  Graphic Arts\r\nFinishers, Inc., 255 N.E.2d at 795 (quoting Williston, Williston on\r\nContracts  102A (3d ed. 1957)). \r\nCastellano reiterated the offer of net credited service\r\nto Hinchey after Hinchey was terminated.  At that point, however,\r\nthere could be no consideration.  Hinchey was no longer working for\r\nNYNEX and could not give anything of value in exchange for the\r\npromise.  The same is true for Seidenberg's offer.  The plaintiff's\r\ncharacterization of the promise as a contract fails as a matter of\r\nlaw because of lack of consideration.  For the reasons stated, we\r\naffirm summary judgment on this count.\r\n                         IV.\r\n                 Promissory Estoppel\r\nAs an alternative to his contract claim, Hinchey argues\r\nthat he is entitled to damages on the basis of promissory estoppel. \r\nSpecifically, he alleges that the promises NYNEX made regarding the\r\n1983 Code, FMP, and net credited service should be enforceable.\r\nUnder the doctrine of promissory estoppel in\r\nMassachusetts, \"'\"[a] promise which the promisor should reasonably\r\nexpect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee\r\nor a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance\r\nis binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the\r\npromise.\"'\"  Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur.\r\nCo., 936 F.2d 1364, 1380 (1st Cir. 1991) (quoting McAndrew v.\r\nSchool Comm. of Cambridge, 480 N.E.2d 327, 332 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n1985) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts  90(1) (1981))). \r\nTo prove his promissory estoppel claims, Hinchey must adduce\r\nevidence of, inter alia, reliance   that is, he must demonstrate\r\nthat he undertook an \"'act or omission resulting from'\" NYNEX's\r\nrepresentations.  Presto v. Sequoia Sys., Inc., 633 F. Supp. 1117,\r\n1120 (D. Mass. 1986) (quoting Cellucci v. Sun Oil Co., 320 N.E.2d\r\n919, 923 (Mass. App. Ct. 1974), aff'd, 331 N.E.2d 813 (Mass.\r\n1975)).  Because Hinchey has failed to produce sufficient evidence\r\nof reasonable reliance as to any of his three claims, we find that\r\nthey fail as a matter of law.\r\nIn regard to the oral promises of net credited service,\r\nHinchey has not adduced adequate evidence of reliance.  Hinchey\r\nasserts that he ceased his pursuit of higher-level review of his\r\n1992 appraisal and terminated his employment search in reliance on\r\nthe Company's promises.  It is irrelevant that, prior to\r\ntermination, Hinchey abandoned his efforts to get higher-level\r\nreview of the appraisal.  As discussed supra, he had rejected a\r\npromise of two years net credited service prior to termination. \r\nTherefore, the only claims which could be viable are the promises\r\nof net credited service made subsequent to termination.  To survive\r\nsummary judgment on this claim, Hinchey would have had to produce\r\nevidence demonstrating that, after being terminated, he decided not\r\nto reinitiate review because of the Company's promises of net\r\ncredited service.  No such evidence exists.  On the contrary,\r\nHinchey vigorously pursued Seidenberg (Vice-Chairman of NYNEX). \r\nAmong other things, Hinchey met with him for one and a half hours. \r\nHe took the opportunity to complain about a variety of things and\r\nprovided Seidenberg with information regarding his 1992 appraisal,\r\ncalling it \"[a] gross instance of discrimination and prejudice,\" in\r\nthe hopes that Seidenberg would rehire him.  There is no evidence\r\nthat the Company's promises in any way induced Hinchey to avoid or\r\nforego an effort to reverse any employment decision.\r\nHinchey's second assertion   that he terminated his\r\nemployment search   also fails.  Hinchey has not offered evidence\r\ndemonstrating that, subsequent to termination, he chose not to seek\r\noutside employment in reliance on the Company's promises.  The\r\nrecord indicates that Hinchey's reason for not pursuing employment\r\nwas that he thought that his termination ruined his reputation and\r\nchances of getting hired.  There is no evidence that the Company's\r\npromises of net credited service induced Hinchey to cease his\r\npursuit of employment.  In fact, Hinchey did not sit idly by,\r\nsatisfied with the prospect of net credited service; rather, he\r\npursued Seidenberg with hopes that Seidenberg would rehire him.  As\r\na matter of law, the Company's post-termination promises did not\r\ncause Hinchey to change his position in any legal sense.  SeeCelucci, 320 N.E.2d at 923.\r\nHinchey has also failed to provide sufficient evidence of\r\nreliance on the promises NYNEX made to him in the FMP.  There is\r\nnothing on the record which would support a reasonable juror's\r\nfinding for Hinchey on this claim.  Again, Hinchey's bald\r\nassertions of reliance   that he ceased his pursuit of higher-level\r\nreview and terminated his employment search   are completely\r\nunsupported by evidence.\r\nFinally, the promissory estoppel claim based on the 1983\r\nCode also fails.  In order to survive summary judgment, Hinchey\r\nmust provide evidence demonstrating that, in reliance on the non-\r\nretaliation provision, he made complaints regarding violations of\r\nthe Code.  Hinchey has failed to provide such evidence.  \r\nThere is no evidentiary support for Hinchey's contention\r\nthat he relied on the Code's protection.  The record indicates that\r\nHinchey's actions were not within the scope of the Code's\r\nprotection.  Rather, his complaints, as memorialized in the letters\r\nsent to Seidenberg subsequent to termination, dealt with\r\ndiscretionary, internal policies of the Company.  Although he\r\ncharacterizes these policies as being \"unbelievable\" and \"gross[ly]\r\nnegligen[t],\" Hinchey does not adduce evidence demonstrating that\r\nthese policies were in fact violations of the Code.  His complaints\r\ntended to deal with technology decisions which Hinchey believed to\r\nbe inefficient or wasteful.  For example, critical of NYNEX's\r\ndecision to invest in certain software development products,\r\nHinchey wrote to Seidenberg, \"Managers and non[-]technical\r\ncharlatans who had never deployed a major commercial application,\r\nwere making reckless and irresponsible acquisitions based purely on\r\npretty pictures and salesmen's hype.\"  Compl., Ex. 13 at 4.  Other\r\nexamples of Hinchey's dissatisfaction with policies and decisions\r\nmade by NYNEX abound.  But without specific evidence demonstrating\r\nthat such internal matters were illegal or otherwise violated the\r\nCode, Hinchey cannot claim that he made these complaints in\r\nreliance on the Code.\r\nWe note, however, that Hinchey has made some allegations\r\nof \"anti-trust and procurement irregularities.\"  Such allegations\r\naddress behavior which is specifically covered in the Code and, if\r\nsupported by the record, might therefore constitute evidence of\r\nHinchey's reliance on the Code.  Specifically, Hinchey stated that\r\nthe Company \"purchase[d] supplies and materials from unqualified []\r\nover[-]priced and/or extraneous vendors in violation of applicable\r\nregulations and law even though significantly superior life cycle\r\nprice/performance alternatives were readily available.\"  Compl. \r\n116-17.  As a result of \"engaging superfluous/less qualified\r\nvendors,\" NYNEX caused \"economic detriment to ratepayers and\r\nstockholders.\"  Id.  The first time Hinchey elaborated on these\r\nallegations of antitrust and procurement abuse was in a deposition,\r\nwhere he mentioned one possible situation.  Although such behavior\r\nwould be covered by the Code, we find this single shred of evidence\r\ninsufficient to warrant trial.  After all, \"[T]he mere existence of\r\na scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will\r\nbe insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could\r\nreasonably find for the plaintiff.\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252.  \r\nThe record is quite clear on the fact that Hinchey spoke\r\nhis mind on a variety of issues, without regard for the animosity\r\nor tension he created in so doing.  His inclination toward\r\ncomplaining is evident.  The fact that, on one single occasion, he\r\ncomplained to Castellano about behavior covered by the Code is not\r\nsufficient to support a plausible assertion of reliance in the face\r\nof a plethora of complaints concerning situations not covered by\r\nthe Code.  In light of all the evidence, no rational juror could\r\nfind that Hinchey relied on the 1983 Code in making his complaints.\r\n                          V.\r\n    Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy   Massachusetts courts recognize an exception to the\r\ngeneral at-will employment rule \"when employment is terminated\r\ncontrary to a well-defined public policy.\"  Wright v. Shriners\r\nHosp. for Crippled Children, 589 N.E.2d 1241, 1244 (Mass. 1992). \r\nFor example: \r\nRedress is available for employees who are\r\nterminated for asserting a legally guaranteed\r\nright (e.g., filing workers' compensation\r\nclaim), for doing what the law requires (e.g.,\r\nserving on a jury), or for refusing to do that\r\nwhich the law forbids (e.g., committing\r\nperjury).\r\n\nSmith-Pfeffer v. Superintendent of the Walter E. Fernald State\r\nSch., 533 N.E.2d 1368, 1371 (Mass. 1989) (relying on multiple\r\nMassachusetts precedents).  Legal redress is also available for\r\nemployees \"terminated for performing important public deeds, even\r\nthough the law does not absolutely require the performance of such\r\na deed,\" Flesner v. Technical Communications Corp., 575 N.E.2d\r\n1107, 1111 (Mass. 1991).  For example, an internal or external\r\ncomplaint made about an alleged violation of criminal law, or\r\n\"whistle blowing,\" falls into this category. See Shea v. Emmanuel\r\nCollege, 682 N.E.2d 1348, 1350 (Mass. 1997).  Internal matters,\r\nhowever, including internal policies, cannot be the basis of a\r\npublic policy exception to the at-will rule.  See King v. Driscoll,\r\n638 N.E.2d 488, 492 (Mass. 1994); Smith-Pfeffer, 533 N.E.2d at\r\n1371-72; Mello v. Stop &amp; Shop Cos., Inc., 524 N.E.2d 105, 108\r\n(Mass. 1988).\r\nHinchey's claim is not one for which Massachusetts courts\r\nhave accorded legal redress.  Although Hinchey now asserts that he\r\nwas terminated for attempting to report NYNEX's antitrust and\r\nprocurement abuses, Hinchey's letters to Seidenberg reveal that his\r\nreport dealt only with internal matters.  In essence, Hinchey's\r\ncomplaints amounted to no more than specific details about\r\ndecisions made by NYNEX management with which Hinchey disagreed.  \r\nHinchey asserts that, as a \"whistle blower,\" his\r\ntermination violated public policy.  See Shea, 682 N.E.2d at 1350. \r\nA plaintiff in these kinds of cases, however, must provide evidence\r\nnot mere assertion or speculation   supporting his claim that he\r\nwas terminated for reporting criminal conduct to his superior.  Seeid.  Hinchey may well have established evidence sufficient for a\r\njury to find that NYNEX terminated him based on the countless\r\ncomplaints he made and the animosity those complaints caused. \r\nDespite his assertions, however, there is nothing in the record\r\ndemonstrating that Hinchey was terminated for reporting criminal\r\nconduct.  Accordingly, summary judgment was granted appropriately\r\non this count.\r\n                         VI.\r\n                   Misrepresentation    Hinchey sets forth numerous misrepresentation claims\r\nregarding the terms of the Code and the FMP, as well as the\r\nCompany's promise of net credited service and statements regarding\r\nHinchey's career status.  For Hinchey to recover for either\r\nintentional or negligent misrepresentation, he must submit evidence\r\nthat NYNEX made false representations and that he reasonably relied\r\non those misrepresentations.  See Robertson v. Gaston Snow &amp; Ely\r\nBartlett, 536 N.E.2d 344, 349 (Mass.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 894\r\n(1989).  For reasons discussed in section IV, supra, we find that\r\nas a matter of law, Hinchey has not provided sufficient evidence of\r\nreasonable reliance on the Code, the FMP, or promises of net\r\ncredited service.  See Chedd-Angier Prod. Co. v. Omni Publications\r\nInt'l, Ltd., 756 F.2d 930, 939 (1st Cir. 1985).\r\nRegarding the career status claims, it is unclear from\r\nhis brief specifically what statements Hinchey is alleging as\r\nmisrepresentation.  In his complaint, Hinchey stated that\r\nCastellano made two misrepresentations regarding his career status. \r\nThe first allegation involved Castellano's pre-termination promise\r\nof a separation plan including net credited service.  As we have\r\nnoted, supra, Hinchey specifically informed Castellano that he was\r\nno longer interested in that plan.  Accordingly, Hinchey cannot\r\nclaim that he reasonably relied on a promise he rejected.  \r\nThe second allegation of misrepresentation involved\r\nCastellano's statement that Hinchey was a valued employee in good\r\nstanding.  Again, Hinchey has not met his burden of demonstrating\r\nreasonable reliance.  As discussed in section IV, supra, Hinchey's\r\nassertion that he suspended higher-level review of his 1992\r\nevaluation and terminated his search for employment are unsupported\r\nby evidence.  After being informed by Castellano of his good\r\nstanding at the Company on July 19, 1993, Hinchey proceeded to\r\npursue a meeting with Seidenberg in order to discuss how the poor\r\nevaluation and lack of promotion had wounded his reputation and his\r\nchances of finding employment.  Hinchey has adduced no evidence\r\nthat he would have acted any differently had Castellano not made\r\nthe good-standing statement.   \r\n                         VII.\r\n                      Conclusion\r\nAlthough the standards for summary judgment are highly\r\nfavorable to the nonmoving party, the nonmovant plaintiff still has\r\na burden to produce evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to\r\nfind in his favor.  Given the dearth of evidence on each of the\r\nseventeen claims, we find that Hinchey has not met that burden. \r\nThe record abounds with conclusory statements and unsupported\r\nallegations, but nothing which would warrant a jury trial.  While\r\nwe may sympathize with an employee who devoted his time, effort,\r\nand talent to one company for twenty-eight years, we cannot accord\r\nhim legal redress where it is unwarranted.  Accordingly, the\r\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment to NYNEX is,\r\nAffirmed. \n",

Specifically, plaintiff's claims include breach of contract, promissory estoppel, intentional misrepresentation, fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and wrongful discharge in violation of public policy.  It is Massachusetts substantive law that controls.  The district court judge granted defendants' motion for summary judgment, based primarily on his determination that plaintiff had not provided sufficient evidence on any of his seventeen claims to warrant a jury trial.

See Dubois v. United States Dep't of Agric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1284 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 2510, 138 L.Ed.2d 1013 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October 1965, plaintiff Hinchey began working for New England Telephone as a candidate for the Initial Management Development Program (\"IMDP\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  After working in various technical management positions and receiving positive evaluations, Hinchey was promoted in 1982 and became responsible for Corporate Communications.  From August 1991 until April 1993, he was an acting Assistant Vice President.  At the time of his termination, Hinchey held the position of Director of Technical Support in the Information Services Organization within TRG.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 1983, the Company distributed its Code of Business Conduct (\"1983 Code\" or \"the Code\") to all employees.  The purpose of the Code was to acquaint employees with the Company's \"core values\" and ethical standards.  In essence, these values and standards amounted to an espousal of responsible and legal behavior on the part of employees and the Company.  The 1983 Code also included a non-retaliation provision which assured an employee protection against reprisal for reporting violations of the Code.  All employees were required to acknowledge their assent to the provisions of the Code with a signature.  Because Hinchey believed that the Code, once signed, would be a binding document, he added the following statement before signing it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>I love the Bell System and New England Tel[ ] Co[ ], but I am not \"satisfied\" with my progress to date and cannot, in conscience[,] fully support all existing interpretations of corporate policy.  Therefore I cannot exclude the possibility of initiating external review of these concerns and situations.  However, my objective continues to be to work toward the betterment of the Company as well as myself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ed McCauley, Hinchey's supervisor at the time, was aware of Hinchey's intention to add the statement.  He was uncertain, however, how it would be interpreted by upper-level management and cautioned Hinchey to carefully consider his decision to add it.  In the end, Hinchey added the statement and considered it to be a negotiated-for exception to portions of the Code which prohibit public disclosure of company policies or practices.  Despite the added statement, Hinchey thought the non-retaliation provision still applied to him.  In fact, he believed that the added statement solidified his perception that the Code was a binding contract between the Company and himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NYNEX revised its Code of Business Conduct in 1992 and 1993, adding, inter alia, a statement expressly disclaiming any contractual obligations.  Although Hinchey received copies of the 1992 and 1993 codes, he did not question the Company's right to alter the substance of the 1983 Code.  Rather, Hinchey continued to assume that his added statement to the 1983 Code was in effect and provided him a contractual exception to the corporate policy of confining complaints within the Company's framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1992, NYNEX implemented a Force Management Plan (\"FMP\") to regulate force reduction procedures for management personnel.  Once a force surplus is perceived, the FMP outlines a detailed procedure by which to identify employees in the surplus job categories and assess them against defined criteria.  A Supervisor's Guide was issued to all management to assist in the downsizing process.  The FMP contained an explicit disclaimer:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>The FMP Guidelines are not inflexible, do not constitute a contract of employment, and should not be interpreted as creating a contract of employment, either expressed or implied.  The employment relationship between the Corporation and its management employees is by mutual consent (employment-at-will), and may be terminated by either the Corporation or the employee at any time for any reason....  These guidelines may be changed unilaterally by the Corporation at any time and for any reason....  Nothing in these guidelines should be interpreted as a limitation, either expressed or implied, on the Corporation's right to discharge or otherwise discipline its employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NYNEX Force Management Plan Resource Guide<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>.  Despite the disclaimer, Hinchey believed that the FMP had been followed in all force reductions that he knew of and that it therefore was a \"mandatory and binding procedure\" which would be followed in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5, 1992, Hinchey began discussions with his direct supervisor, Vice President Joseph Castellano, regarding \"business and procurement irregularities\" allegedly perpetrated by NYNEX.  Hinchey complained that he had observed a \"pattern of negligence and closed-mindedness\" within NYNEX for twenty-five years that he thought clearly violated the Code of Business Conduct.  Hinchey asserts that Castellano made no attempt to address his concerns or end the irregularities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1993, Hinchey received his performance appraisal for 1992.  Despite mostly positive feedback, he received what he considered to be a negative evaluation in the \"Communication\" category.  Hinchey knew that such an evaluation might lead to termination under the FMP, so he approached Castellano on February 24, 1993, to talk about a voluntary separation plan for himself.  Hinchey's proposed plan included, inter alia, a stipulation that he would receive two years \"net credited service\" in return for his voluntary separation.  \"Net credited service\" refers to the number of years an employee has worked at NYNEX.  The Company's retirement plan specified that an employee with less than thirty years of service to the Company (i.e., thirty years of net credited service) at the time of retirement would be subjected to a pension reduction.  Because he had been employed at NYNEX for only twenty-eight years, his separation proposal included a stipulation that he would be given two extra years of net credited service in order to ensure a full pension.  Castellano told Hinchey that he would consider his proposal.  Hinchey heard nothing further about his plan for several months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 19, 1993, Hinchey called Ivan Seidenberg, Vice-Chairman of NYNEX, to schedule an appointment during which Hinchey could discuss his allegations of irregularities.  One hour later, Hinchey received a phone call from Castellano, during which Castellano stated, \"Of course you can talk with Ivan [Seidenberg] if you wish but I have worked out just what you want.\"   Hinchey responded, \"Joe [Castellano], that's not what I want, that's what I said I would accept back in February.\"   He also said, \"Now you have demoted me and have ruined my career and now you've ruined my reputation and unless I get a permanent promotion I am going to talk it over with Ivan.  I don't understand why you couldn't have just talked with me and have been straight with me.\"   Pl.'s Aff. dated July 10, 1997, at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 5, 1993, Hinchey met with Castellano and was terminated.  Hinchey's termination papers indicated that he was discharged under the FMP. At that meeting, Hinchey was told by Castellano that he would receive the net credited service he had requested, even if it had to be paid out of departmental funds.  Castellano instructed Hinchey to see William Coffey, Director of NYNEX's Human Resources Department, to \"work it out.\"   When Hinchey spoke to Coffey, however, Coffey stated that a grant of net credited service could not be provided within the framework of an FMP termination, but that he would work on it with Castellano.  On one or two other occasions, Castellano reasserted his promise to Hinchey, telling him to submit a voucher for the net credited service.  When Hinchey submitted a voucher to Castellano, however, Castellano sent it back to him with a note explaining that he needed to see Coffey regarding this issue.  Hinchey never received the two years net credited service that Castellano promised he would receive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to his termination, Hinchey canceled his scheduled meeting with Seidenberg.  He persisted, however, in trying to set up a conference with Seidenberg.  In December, Seidenberg finally met with Hinchey, but Hinchey asserts that the one and a half hour meeting did not provide sufficient time to cover all of his concerns.  As a result, Hinchey sent Seidenberg a series of letters with attachments detailing the company policies and practices with which he was concerned.  During this time, Hinchey was also in contact with Bill Pucci, NYNEX's Managing Director--Office of Business Conduct.  Pucci informed Hinchey that, in an effort to settle the matter, Seidenberg would be willing to offer him a short-term position as a consultant, two years of net credited service equivalent in an annuity, and access to an executive placement service.  Hinchey responded that the proposal did not offer what he considered to be appropriate compensation considering the damage his reputation had suffered.  Hinchey later stated to Pucci, \"I would consider a million dollars appropriate if they hired me back, and ... if I'm left with nothing, no reputation, 10 million dollars wouldn't be enough.\"   Hinchey Dep. dated February 13, 1997, at 97.  Although Hinchey indicated that these dollar amounts were not \"hard numbers,\" no final agreement between Hinchey and Seidenberg was reached, and Hinchey consequently brought this lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.  See Dubois, 102 F.3d at 1283.   Summary judgment may be granted only when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  \"[T]he mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment....\"  Anderson v.

This burden \"may be discharged by 'showing'--that is, pointing out to the district court--that there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.\"  Id. at 325, 106 S.Ct. at 2554.   After such a showing, the \"burden shifts to the nonmoving party, with respect to each issue on which he has the burden of proof, to demonstrate that a trier of fact reasonably could find in his favor.\"  DeNovellis v.

See Jackson v. Action for Boston Community Dev., Inc., 403 Mass. 8, 525 N.E.2d 411, 412 (1988).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (\"SJC\") has determined that a personnel manual may, in some cases, form the basis of such a contract.  See O'Brien v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 422 Mass. 686, 664 N.E.2d 843, 847 (1996) (citing Jackson, 525 N.E.2d at 415);  see also Hobson v. McLean Hosp. Corp., 402 Mass. 413, 522 N.E.2d 975, 977 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no explicit test or \"rigid list of prerequisites\" to aid in ascertaining if a personnel manual comprises a binding contract under Massachusetts law.  O'Brien, 664 N.E.2d at 847.   Rather, factfinders must consider several factors recently articulated by the SJC in Jackson, 403 Mass. 8, 525 N.E.2d 411, which held that no implied contract based on the terms of the personnel manual existed where:  1) the employer retained the right to unilaterally modify terms;  2) the terms of the manual were not negotiated;  3) the manual stated that it provided only guidance regarding the employer's policies;  4) no term of employment was specified in the manual;  5) the employee did not sign the manual to manifest assent.  Id. at 415-16.   The SJC has clarified that these factors are not an inflexible list, but rather a set of circumstances which would \"make a difference or might make a difference in deciding whether the terms of a personnel manual were at least impliedly part of an employment contract.\"  O'Brien, 664 N.E.2d at 847.   Stated another way, these factors help determine if an employee could reasonably have believed that the \"employment manuals he or she was given constituted the terms or conditions of employment, equally binding on employee and employer.\"  Derrig v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 942 F.Supp. 49, 55 (D.Mass.1996) (citing O'Brien, 664 N.E.2d at 848-49).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first issue is whether it was objectively reasonable for Hinchey to believe that the terms of the 1983 Code comprised mutually binding contractual obligations.  The added statement, essentially declaring that Hinchey did not assent to the full terms of the Code, did not make the Code mutually binding.  His assertion that the added statement constituted a negotiated-for exception to the Code is based on an assumption that has no legal or factual foundation.  Hinchey has produced no evidence showing or tending to show that McCauley (the supervisor present when the statement was added) had actual authority to negotiate exceptions to the 1983 Code.  Nor was there any evidence of apparent authority, which \" 'results from conduct by the principal which causes a third person reasonably to believe that a particular person ... has authority to enter into negotiations or to make representations as his agent.' \"  Linkage Corp. v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 425 Mass. 1, 679 N.E.2d 191, 203, cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 599, 139 L.Ed.2d 488 (1997) (alteration in original) (quoting Hudson v. Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Ass'n, 386 Mass. 450, 436 N.E.2d 155, 159 (1982)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, even if McCauley had possessed authority to negotiate a contractual exception to the Code, there is no evidence that any real negotiations occurred.  Hinchey himself testified in a deposition that his supervisor counseled against adding the statement.  That Hinchey added it anyway does not demonstrate that a negotiation about the terms of the Code took place.  In addition, the ambiguous language of the statement cannot be read as an exemption to a specific provision.  Rather, the statement appears to be a general exception allowing Hinchey the opportunity to decide in the future whether or not he will abide by the Code.  Accordingly, we find that no rational juror could conclude that it was objectively reasonable for Hinchey to believe that the 1983 Code was mutually binding on him and the Company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey's claim regarding the breach of the FMP also fails as a matter of law.  Hinchey asserts that there is a disputed issue of material fact regarding whether proper FMP procedures were followed prior to his termination.  We need not reach that issue, however, because we find that the FMP contained no binding contractual obligations.  There is simply a dearth of evidence in the record supporting Hinchey's contention that he reasonably believed the FMP was a \"mandatory and binding procedure.\"   Clearly, there was no negotiation regarding the terms of the manual, nor was there a term of employment specified within it.  Further, there was an explicit disclaimer, in which NYNEX retained the right to unilaterally modify the FMP. Hinchey, by his own assertion, was extremely knowledgeable of the FMP and proficient in its implementation.  Accordingly, a rational juror could only conclude that Hinchey's awareness of the disclaimer, in addition to the absence of any negotiation or specified term of employment, made it unreasonable for him to claim the FMP as a source of contractual rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Net Credited Service</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey asserts that the Company's oral promise (made by Castellano) to give him two years of net credited service was a contractually binding agreement.  To survive summary judgment on this claim, Hinchey must provide evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to find that he proved each element of the contract.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552.   We examine first the factual foundation for Hinchey's oral contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stripped to their essentials, the facts are as follows.  Hinchey proposed to Castellano that he would retire voluntarily if he were given two years net credited service so as to bring his twenty-eight years of service up to thirty years, thus giving him a full pension.  Six months later, Castellano told Hinchey that he had \"worked out just what you want.\"   Hinchey rejected this offer and told Castellano that he wanted a permanent promotion.  Hinchey met with Castellano a month later and was terminated under the FMP. He was told by Castellano that he would receive the two years net credited service.  There is no doubt that Hinchey was given the run-around by Castellano and Coffey when he attempted to obtain the net credited service.  This, however, did not deter him from pursuing Seidenberg, Vice-Chairman of NYNEX.  He was also in contact with Pucci, Director of NYNEX's Office of Business Conduct.  Pucci told him that Seidenberg was willing to offer him a short-term position as a consultant, two years of net credited service equivalent in an annuity and access to an executive placement service.  Hinchey rejected this offer and later told Pucci that he \"would consider a million dollars appropriate, if they hire me back.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey rejected the two oral offers made by the Company, upping the ante each time.  Clearly, there was no meeting of the minds and hence no contract.  See Jamestown Portland Cement Corp. v. Bowles, 228 Mass. 176, 117 N.E. 41, 43 (1917).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, there could be no oral contract because of the failure of consideration by Hinchey.  The promises relied upon by Hinchey were made after his termination.  \"[I]n order for a contract to have valid consideration, the contract must be a bargained-for exchange in which there is a legal detriment of the promisee or a corresponding benefit to the promisor.\"  Frankina v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 801 F.Supp. 875, 886 (D.Mass.1992), aff'd, 991 F.2d 786 (1st Cir.1993) (citing Graphic Arts Finishers, Inc. v. Boston Redevelopment Auth., 357 Mass. 40, 255 N.E.2d 793, 795 (1970)).  Legal detriment means \" 'giving up something which immediately prior thereto the promisee was privileged to retain, or doing or refraining from doing something which he was then privileged not to do, or not to refrain from doing.' \"  Graphic Arts Finishers, Inc., 255 N.E.2d at 795 (quoting Williston, Williston on Contracts &#167; 102A (3d ed.1957)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Castellano reiterated the offer of net credited service to Hinchey after Hinchey was terminated.  At that point, however, there could be no consideration.  Hinchey was no longer working for NYNEX and could not give anything of value in exchange for the promise.  The same is true for Seidenberg's offer.  The plaintiff's characterization of the promise as a contract fails as a matter of law because of lack of consideration.  For the reasons stated, we affirm summary judgment on this count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Promissory Estoppel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to his contract claim, Hinchey argues that he is entitled to damages on the basis of promissory estoppel.  Specifically, he alleges that the promises NYNEX made regarding the 1983 Code, FMP, and net credited service should be enforceable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the doctrine of promissory estoppel in Massachusetts, \" ' \"[a] promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise.\" ' \"  Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1380 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting McAndrew v. School Comm. of Cambridge, 20 Mass.App.Ct. 356, 480 N.E.2d 327, 332 (1985) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 90(1) (1981))).  To prove his promissory estoppel claims, Hinchey must adduce evidence of, inter alia, reliance--that is, he must demonstrate that he undertook an \" 'act or omission resulting from' \" NYNEX's representations.  Presto v. Sequoia Sys., Inc., 633 F.Supp. 1117, 1120 (D.Mass.1986) (quoting Cellucci v. Sun Oil Co., 2 Mass.App.Ct. 722, 320 N.E.2d 919, 923 (1974), aff'd, 368 Mass. 811, 331 N.E.2d 813 (1975)).  Because Hinchey has failed to produce sufficient evidence of reasonable reliance as to any of his three claims, we find that they fail as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to the oral promises of net credited service, Hinchey has not adduced adequate evidence of reliance.  Hinchey asserts that he ceased his pursuit of higher-level review of his 1992 appraisal and terminated his employment search in reliance on the Company's promises.  It is irrelevant that, prior to termination, Hinchey abandoned his efforts to get higher-level review of the appraisal.  As discussed supra, he had rejected a promise of two years net credited service prior to termination.  Therefore, the only claims which could be viable are the promises of net credited service made subsequent to termination.  To survive summary judgment on this claim, Hinchey would have had to produce evidence demonstrating that, after being terminated, he decided not to reinitiate review because of the Company's promises of net credited service.  No such evidence exists.  On the contrary, Hinchey vigorously pursued Seidenberg (Vice-Chairman of NYNEX).  Among other things, Hinchey met with him for one and a half hours.  He took the opportunity to complain about a variety of things and provided Seidenberg with information regarding his 1992 appraisal, calling it \"[a] gross instance of discrimination and prejudice,\" in the hopes that Seidenberg would rehire him.  There is no evidence that the Company's promises in any way induced Hinchey to avoid or forego an effort to reverse any employment decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey's second assertion--that he terminated his employment search--also fails.  Hinchey has not offered evidence demonstrating that, subsequent to termination, he chose not to seek outside employment in reliance on the Company's promises.  The record indicates that Hinchey's reason for not pursuing employment was that he thought that his termination ruined his reputation and chances of getting hired.  There is no evidence that the Company's promises of net credited service induced Hinchey to cease his pursuit of employment.  In fact, Hinchey did not sit idly by, satisfied with the prospect of net credited service;  rather, he pursued Seidenberg with hopes that Seidenberg would rehire him.  As a matter of law, the Company's post-termination promises did not cause Hinchey to change his position in any legal sense.  See Cellucci, 320 N.E.2d at 923.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey has also failed to provide sufficient evidence of reliance on the promises NYNEX made to him in the FMP. There is nothing on the record which would support a reasonable juror's finding for Hinchey on this claim.  Again, Hinchey's bald assertions of reliance--that he ceased his pursuit of higher-level review and terminated his employment search--are completely unsupported by evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the promissory estoppel claim based on the 1983 Code also fails.  In order to survive summary judgment, Hinchey must provide evidence demonstrating that, in reliance on the non-retaliation provision, he made complaints regarding violations of the Code.  Hinchey has failed to provide such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidentiary support for Hinchey's contention that he relied on the Code's protection.  The record indicates that Hinchey's actions were not within the scope of the Code's protection.  Rather, his complaints, as memorialized in the letters sent to Seidenberg subsequent to termination, dealt with discretionary, internal policies of the Company.  Although he characterizes these policies as being \"unbelievable\" and \"gross[ly] negligen[t],\" Hinchey does not adduce evidence demonstrating that these policies were in fact violations of the Code.  His complaints tended to deal with technology decisions which Hinchey believed to be inefficient or wasteful.  For example, critical of NYNEX's decision to invest in certain software development products, Hinchey wrote to Seidenberg, \"Managers and non[-]technical charlatans who had never deployed a major commercial application, were making reckless and irresponsible acquisitions based purely on pretty pictures and salesmen's hype.\"   Compl., Ex. 13 at 4. Other examples of Hinchey's dissatisfaction with policies and decisions made by NYNEX abound.  But without specific evidence demonstrating that such internal matters were illegal or otherwise violated the Code, Hinchey cannot claim that he made these complaints in reliance on the Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, however, that Hinchey has made some allegations of \"anti-trust and procurement irregularities.\"   Such allegations address behavior which is specifically covered in the Code and, if supported by the record, might therefore constitute evidence of Hinchey's reliance on the Code.  Specifically, Hinchey stated that the Company \"purchase[d] supplies and materials from unqualified [ ] over[-]priced and/or extraneous vendors in violation of applicable regulations and law even though significantly superior life cycle price/performance alternatives were readily available.\"   Compl. p 116-17.  As a result of \"engaging superfluous/less qualified vendors,\" NYNEX caused \"economic detriment to ratepayers and stockholders.\"  Id. The first time Hinchey elaborated on these allegations of antitrust and procurement abuse was in a deposition, where he mentioned one possible situation.  Although such behavior would be covered by the Code, we find this single shred of evidence insufficient to warrant trial.  After all, \"[T]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient;  there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is quite clear on the fact that Hinchey spoke his mind on a variety of issues, without regard for the animosity or tension he created in so doing.  His inclination toward complaining is evident.  The fact that, on one single occasion, he complained to Castellano about behavior covered by the Code is not sufficient to support a plausible assertion of reliance in the face of a plethora of complaints concerning situations not covered by the Code.  In light of all the evidence, no rational juror could find that Hinchey relied on the 1983 Code in making his complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts courts recognize an exception to the general at-will employment rule \"when employment is terminated contrary to a well-defined public policy.\"  Wright v.

For example:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>Redress is available for employees who are terminated for asserting a legally guaranteed right (e.g., filing workers' compensation claim), for doing what the law requires (e.g., serving on a jury), or for refusing to do that which the law forbids (e.g., committing perjury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smith-Pfeffer v. Superintendent of the Walter E. Fernald State Sch., 404 Mass. 145, 533 N.E.2d 1368, 1371 (1989) (relying on multiple Massachusetts precedents).  Legal redress is also available for employees \"terminated for performing important public deeds, even though the law does not absolutely require the performance of such a deed,\" Flesner v. Technical Communications Corp., 410 Mass. 805, 575 N.E.2d 1107, 1111 (1991).  For example, an internal or external complaint made about an alleged violation of criminal law, or \"whistle blowing,\" falls into this category.  See Shea v. Emmanuel College, 425 Mass. 761, 682 N.E.2d 1348, 1350 (1997).  Internal matters, however, including internal policies, cannot be the basis of a public policy exception to the at-will rule.  See King v. Driscoll, 418 Mass. 576, 638 N.E.2d 488, 492 (1994);  Smith-Pfeffer, 533 N.E.2d at 1371-72;  Mello v. Stop &amp; Shop Cos., Inc., 402 Mass. 555, 524 N.E.2d 105, 108 (1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey's claim is not one for which Massachusetts courts have accorded legal redress.  Although Hinchey now asserts that he was terminated for attempting to report NYNEX's antitrust and procurement abuses, Hinchey's letters to Seidenberg reveal that his report dealt only with internal matters.  In essence, Hinchey's complaints amounted to no more than specific details about decisions made by NYNEX management with which Hinchey disagreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey asserts that, as a \"whistle blower,\" his termination violated public policy.  See Shea, 682 N.E.2d at 1350.   A plaintiff in these kinds of cases, however, must provide evidence--not mere assertion or speculation--supporting his claim that he was terminated for reporting criminal conduct to his superior.  See id.   Hinchey may well have established evidence sufficient for a jury to find that NYNEX terminated him based on the countless complaints he made and the animosity those complaints caused.  Despite his assertions, however, there is nothing in the record demonstrating that Hinchey was terminated for reporting criminal conduct.  Accordingly, summary judgment was granted appropriately on this count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <p>Misrepresentation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey sets forth numerous misrepresentation claims regarding the terms of the Code and the FMP, as well as the Company's promise of net credited service and statements regarding Hinchey's career status.  For Hinchey to recover for either intentional or negligent misrepresentation, he must submit evidence that NYNEX made false representations and that he reasonably relied on those misrepresentations.  See Robertson v. Gaston Snow &amp; Ely Bartlett, 404 Mass. 515, 536 N.E.2d 344, 349, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 894, 110 S.Ct. 242, 107 L.Ed.2d 192 (1989).  For reasons discussed in section IV, supra, we find that as a matter of law, Hinchey has not provided sufficient evidence of reasonable reliance on the Code, the FMP, or promises of net credited service.  See Chedd-Angier Prod.  Co. v. Omni Publications Int'l, Ltd., 756 F.2d 930, 939 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the career status claims, it is unclear from his brief specifically what statements Hinchey is alleging as misrepresentation.  In his complaint, Hinchey stated that Castellano made two misrepresentations regarding his career status.  The first allegation involved Castellano's pre-termination promise of a separation plan including net credited service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  As we have noted, supra, Hinchey specifically informed Castellano that he was no longer interested in that plan.  Accordingly, Hinchey cannot claim that he reasonably relied on a promise he rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second allegation of misrepresentation involved Castellano's statement that Hinchey was a valued employee in good standing.  Again, Hinchey has not met his burden of demonstrating reasonable reliance.  As discussed in section IV, supra, Hinchey's assertion that he suspended higher-level review of his 1992 evaluation and terminated his search for employment are unsupported by evidence.  After being informed by Castellano of his good standing at the Company on July 19, 1993, Hinchey proceeded to pursue a meeting with Seidenberg in order to discuss how the poor evaluation and lack of promotion had wounded his reputation and his chances of finding employment.  Hinchey has adduced no evidence that he would have acted any differently had Castellano not made the good-standing statement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the standards for summary judgment are highly favorable to the nonmoving party, the nonmovant plaintiff still has a burden to produce evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to find in his favor.  Given the dearth of evidence on each of the seventeen claims, we find that Hinchey has not met that burden.  The record abounds with conclusory statements and unsupported allegations, but nothing which would warrant a jury trial.  While we may sympathize with an employee who devoted his time, effort, and talent to one company for twenty-eight years, we cannot accord him legal redress where it is unwarranted.

From August 1991 until April 1993, he was an acting Assistant Vice President.  At the time of his termination, Hinchey held the position of Director of Technical Support in the Information Services Organization within TRG.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 1983, the Company distributed its Code of Business Conduct (\"1983 Code\" or \"the Code\") to all employees.  The purpose of the Code was to acquaint employees with the Company's \"core values\" and ethical standards.  In essence, these values and standards amounted to an espousal of responsible and legal behavior on the part of employees and the Company.  The 1983 Code also included a non-retaliation provision which assured an employee protection against reprisal for reporting violations of the Code.  All employees were required to acknowledge their assent to the provisions of the Code with a signature.  Because Hinchey believed that the Code, once signed, would be a binding document, he added the following statement before signing it:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p>I love the Bell System and New England Tel[ ] Co[ ], but I am not \"satisfied\" with my progress to date and cannot, in conscience[,] fully support all existing interpretations of corporate policy.  Therefore I cannot exclude the possibility of initiating external review of these concerns and situations.  However, my objective continues to be to work toward the betterment of the Company as well as myself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ed McCauley, Hinchey's supervisor at the time, was aware of Hinchey's intention to add the statement.  He was uncertain, however, how it would be interpreted by upper-level management and cautioned Hinchey to carefully consider his decision to add it.  In the end, Hinchey added the statement and considered it to be a negotiated-for exception to portions of the Code which prohibit public disclosure of company policies or practices.  Despite the added statement, Hinchey thought the non-retaliation provision still applied to him.  In fact, he believed that the added statement solidified his perception that the Code was a binding contract between the Company and himself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NYNEX revised its Code of Business Conduct in 1992 and 1993, adding, inter alia, a statement expressly disclaiming any contractual obligations.  Although Hinchey received copies of the 1992 and 1993 codes, he did not question the Company's right to alter the substance of the 1983 Code.  Rather, Hinchey continued to assume that his added statement to the 1983 Code was in effect and provided him a contractual exception to the corporate policy of confining complaints within the Company's framework.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1992, NYNEX implemented a Force Management Plan (\"FMP\") to regulate force reduction procedures for management personnel.  Once a force surplus is perceived, the FMP outlines a detailed procedure by which to identify employees in the surplus job categories and assess them against defined criteria.  A Supervisor's Guide was issued to all management to assist in the downsizing process.  The FMP contained an explicit disclaimer:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>The FMP Guidelines are not inflexible, do not constitute a contract of employment, and should not be interpreted as creating a contract of employment, either expressed or implied.  The employment relationship between the Corporation and its management employees is by mutual consent (employment-at-will), and may be terminated by either the Corporation or the employee at any time for any reason....  These guidelines may be changed unilaterally by the Corporation at any time and for any reason....  Nothing in these guidelines should be interpreted as a limitation, either expressed or implied, on the Corporation's right to discharge or otherwise discipline its employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NYNEX Force Management Plan Resource Guide<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>.  Despite the disclaimer, Hinchey believed that the FMP had been followed in all force reductions that he knew of and that it therefore was a \"mandatory and binding procedure\" which would be followed in the future.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 5, 1992, Hinchey began discussions with his direct supervisor, Vice President Joseph Castellano, regarding \"business and procurement irregularities\" allegedly perpetrated by NYNEX.  Hinchey complained that he had observed a \"pattern of negligence and closed-mindedness\" within NYNEX for twenty-five years that he thought clearly violated the Code of Business Conduct.  Hinchey asserts that Castellano made no attempt to address his concerns or end the irregularities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early 1993, Hinchey received his performance appraisal for 1992.  Despite mostly positive feedback, he received what he considered to be a negative evaluation in the \"Communication\" category.  Hinchey knew that such an evaluation might lead to termination under the FMP, so he approached Castellano on February 24, 1993, to talk about a voluntary separation plan for himself.  Hinchey's proposed plan included, inter alia, a stipulation that he would receive two years \"net credited service\" in return for his voluntary separation.  \"Net credited service\" refers to the number of years an employee has worked at NYNEX.  The Company's retirement plan specified that an employee with less than thirty years of service to the Company (i.e., thirty years of net credited service) at the time of retirement would be subjected to a pension reduction.  Because he had been employed at NYNEX for only twenty-eight years, his separation proposal included a stipulation that he would be given two extra years of net credited service in order to ensure a full pension.  Castellano told Hinchey that he would consider his proposal.  Hinchey heard nothing further about his plan for several months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 19, 1993, Hinchey called Ivan Seidenberg, Vice-Chairman of NYNEX, to schedule an appointment during which Hinchey could discuss his allegations of irregularities.  One hour later, Hinchey received a phone call from Castellano, during which Castellano stated, \"Of course you can talk with Ivan [Seidenberg] if you wish but I have worked out just what you want.\"   Hinchey responded, \"Joe [Castellano], that's not what I want, that's what I said I would accept back in February.\"   He also said, \"Now you have demoted me and have ruined my career and now you've ruined my reputation and unless I get a permanent promotion I am going to talk it over with Ivan.  I don't understand why you couldn't have just talked with me and have been straight with me.\"   Pl.'s Aff. dated July 10, 1997, at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 5, 1993, Hinchey met with Castellano and was terminated.  Hinchey's termination papers indicated that he was discharged under the FMP. At that meeting, Hinchey was told by Castellano that he would receive the net credited service he had requested, even if it had to be paid out of departmental funds.  Castellano instructed Hinchey to see William Coffey, Director of NYNEX's Human Resources Department, to \"work it out.\"   When Hinchey spoke to Coffey, however, Coffey stated that a grant of net credited service could not be provided within the framework of an FMP termination, but that he would work on it with Castellano.  On one or two other occasions, Castellano reasserted his promise to Hinchey, telling him to submit a voucher for the net credited service.  When Hinchey submitted a voucher to Castellano, however, Castellano sent it back to him with a note explaining that he needed to see Coffey regarding this issue.  Hinchey never received the two years net credited service that Castellano promised he would receive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to his termination, Hinchey canceled his scheduled meeting with Seidenberg.  He persisted, however, in trying to set up a conference with Seidenberg.  In December, Seidenberg finally met with Hinchey, but Hinchey asserts that the one and a half hour meeting did not provide sufficient time to cover all of his concerns.  As a result, Hinchey sent Seidenberg a series of letters with attachments detailing the company policies and practices with which he was concerned.  During this time, Hinchey was also in contact with Bill Pucci, NYNEX's Managing Director--Office of Business Conduct.  Pucci informed Hinchey that, in an effort to settle the matter, Seidenberg would be willing to offer him a short-term position as a consultant, two years of net credited service equivalent in an annuity, and access to an executive placement service.  Hinchey responded that the proposal did not offer what he considered to be appropriate compensation considering the damage his reputation had suffered.  Hinchey later stated to Pucci, \"I would consider a million dollars appropriate if they hired me back, and ... if I'm left with nothing, no reputation, 10 million dollars wouldn't be enough.\"   Hinchey Dep. dated February 13, 1997, at 97.  Although Hinchey indicated that these dollar amounts were not \"hard numbers,\" no final agreement between Hinchey and Seidenberg was reached, and Hinchey consequently brought this lawsuit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo.

Id. at 415-16.   The SJC has clarified that these factors are not an inflexible list, but rather a set of circumstances which would \"make a difference or might make a difference in deciding whether the terms of a personnel manual were at least impliedly part of an employment contract.\"  O'Brien, 664 N.E.2d at 847.

The added statement, essentially declaring that Hinchey did not assent to the full terms of the Code, did not make the Code mutually binding.  His assertion that the added statement constituted a negotiated-for exception to the Code is based on an assumption that has no legal or factual foundation.  Hinchey has produced no evidence showing or tending to show that McCauley (the supervisor present when the statement was added) had actual authority to negotiate exceptions to the 1983 Code.  Nor was there any evidence of apparent authority, which \" 'results from conduct by the principal which causes a third person reasonably to believe that a particular person ... has authority to enter into negotiations or to make representations as his agent.' \"  Linkage Corp. v.

Hinchey himself testified in a deposition that his supervisor counseled against adding the statement.  That Hinchey added it anyway does not demonstrate that a negotiation about the terms of the Code took place.  In addition, the ambiguous language of the statement cannot be read as an exemption to a specific provision.  Rather, the statement appears to be a general exception allowing Hinchey the opportunity to decide in the future whether or not he will abide by the Code.  Accordingly, we find that no rational juror could conclude that it was objectively reasonable for Hinchey to believe that the 1983 Code was mutually binding on him and the Company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey's claim regarding the breach of the FMP also fails as a matter of law.  Hinchey asserts that there is a disputed issue of material fact regarding whether proper FMP procedures were followed prior to his termination.  We need not reach that issue, however, because we find that the FMP contained no binding contractual obligations.  There is simply a dearth of evidence in the record supporting Hinchey's contention that he reasonably believed the FMP was a \"mandatory and binding procedure.\"   Clearly, there was no negotiation regarding the terms of the manual, nor was there a term of employment specified within it.  Further, there was an explicit disclaimer, in which NYNEX retained the right to unilaterally modify the FMP. Hinchey, by his own assertion, was extremely knowledgeable of the FMP and proficient in its implementation.  Accordingly, a rational juror could only conclude that Hinchey's awareness of the disclaimer, in addition to the absence of any negotiation or specified term of employment, made it unreasonable for him to claim the FMP as a source of contractual rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Net Credited Service</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey asserts that the Company's oral promise (made by Castellano) to give him two years of net credited service was a contractually binding agreement.  To survive summary judgment on this claim, Hinchey must provide evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to find that he proved each element of the contract.  See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552.   We examine first the factual foundation for Hinchey's oral contract claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stripped to their essentials, the facts are as follows.  Hinchey proposed to Castellano that he would retire voluntarily if he were given two years net credited service so as to bring his twenty-eight years of service up to thirty years, thus giving him a full pension.  Six months later, Castellano told Hinchey that he had \"worked out just what you want.\"   Hinchey rejected this offer and told Castellano that he wanted a permanent promotion.  Hinchey met with Castellano a month later and was terminated under the FMP. He was told by Castellano that he would receive the two years net credited service.  There is no doubt that Hinchey was given the run-around by Castellano and Coffey when he attempted to obtain the net credited service.  This, however, did not deter him from pursuing Seidenberg, Vice-Chairman of NYNEX.  He was also in contact with Pucci, Director of NYNEX's Office of Business Conduct.  Pucci told him that Seidenberg was willing to offer him a short-term position as a consultant, two years of net credited service equivalent in an annuity and access to an executive placement service.  Hinchey rejected this offer and later told Pucci that he \"would consider a million dollars appropriate, if they hire me back.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey rejected the two oral offers made by the Company, upping the ante each time.  Clearly, there was no meeting of the minds and hence no contract.  See Jamestown Portland Cement Corp. v.

The promises relied upon by Hinchey were made after his termination.  \"[I]n order for a contract to have valid consideration, the contract must be a bargained-for exchange in which there is a legal detriment of the promisee or a corresponding benefit to the promisor.\"  Frankina v.

At that point, however, there could be no consideration.  Hinchey was no longer working for NYNEX and could not give anything of value in exchange for the promise.  The same is true for Seidenberg's offer.  The plaintiff's characterization of the promise as a contract fails as a matter of law because of lack of consideration.  For the reasons stated, we affirm summary judgment on this count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <p>Promissory Estoppel</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an alternative to his contract claim, Hinchey argues that he is entitled to damages on the basis of promissory estoppel.

Because Hinchey has failed to produce sufficient evidence of reasonable reliance as to any of his three claims, we find that they fail as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to the oral promises of net credited service, Hinchey has not adduced adequate evidence of reliance.  Hinchey asserts that he ceased his pursuit of higher-level review of his 1992 appraisal and terminated his employment search in reliance on the Company's promises.  It is irrelevant that, prior to termination, Hinchey abandoned his efforts to get higher-level review of the appraisal.  As discussed supra, he had rejected a promise of two years net credited service prior to termination.  Therefore, the only claims which could be viable are the promises of net credited service made subsequent to termination.  To survive summary judgment on this claim, Hinchey would have had to produce evidence demonstrating that, after being terminated, he decided not to reinitiate review because of the Company's promises of net credited service.  No such evidence exists.  On the contrary, Hinchey vigorously pursued Seidenberg (Vice-Chairman of NYNEX).  Among other things, Hinchey met with him for one and a half hours.  He took the opportunity to complain about a variety of things and provided Seidenberg with information regarding his 1992 appraisal, calling it \"[a] gross instance of discrimination and prejudice,\" in the hopes that Seidenberg would rehire him.  There is no evidence that the Company's promises in any way induced Hinchey to avoid or forego an effort to reverse any employment decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey's second assertion--that he terminated his employment search--also fails.  Hinchey has not offered evidence demonstrating that, subsequent to termination, he chose not to seek outside employment in reliance on the Company's promises.  The record indicates that Hinchey's reason for not pursuing employment was that he thought that his termination ruined his reputation and chances of getting hired.  There is no evidence that the Company's promises of net credited service induced Hinchey to cease his pursuit of employment.  In fact, Hinchey did not sit idly by, satisfied with the prospect of net credited service;  rather, he pursued Seidenberg with hopes that Seidenberg would rehire him.  As a matter of law, the Company's post-termination promises did not cause Hinchey to change his position in any legal sense.  See Cellucci, 320 N.E.2d at 923.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hinchey has also failed to provide sufficient evidence of reliance on the promises NYNEX made to him in the FMP. There is nothing on the record which would support a reasonable juror's finding for Hinchey on this claim.  Again, Hinchey's bald assertions of reliance--that he ceased his pursuit of higher-level review and terminated his employment search--are completely unsupported by evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the promissory estoppel claim based on the 1983 Code also fails.  In order to survive summary judgment, Hinchey must provide evidence demonstrating that, in reliance on the non-retaliation provision, he made complaints regarding violations of the Code.  Hinchey has failed to provide such evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no evidentiary support for Hinchey's contention that he relied on the Code's protection.  The record indicates that Hinchey's actions were not within the scope of the Code's protection.  Rather, his complaints, as memorialized in the letters sent to Seidenberg subsequent to termination, dealt with discretionary, internal policies of the Company.  Although he characterizes these policies as being \"unbelievable\" and \"gross[ly] negligen[t],\" Hinchey does not adduce evidence demonstrating that these policies were in fact violations of the Code.  His complaints tended to deal with technology decisions which Hinchey believed to be inefficient or wasteful.  For example, critical of NYNEX's decision to invest in certain software development products, Hinchey wrote to Seidenberg, \"Managers and non[-]technical charlatans who had never deployed a major commercial application, were making reckless and irresponsible acquisitions based purely on pretty pictures and salesmen's hype.\"   Compl., Ex. 13 at 4. Other examples of Hinchey's dissatisfaction with policies and decisions made by NYNEX abound.  But without specific evidence demonstrating that such internal matters were illegal or otherwise violated the Code, Hinchey cannot claim that he made these complaints in reliance on the Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, however, that Hinchey has made some allegations of \"anti-trust and procurement irregularities.\"   Such allegations address behavior which is specifically covered in the Code and, if supported by the record, might therefore constitute evidence of Hinchey's reliance on the Code.  Specifically, Hinchey stated that the Company \"purchase[d] supplies and materials from unqualified [ ] over[-]priced and/or extraneous vendors in violation of applicable regulations and law even though significantly superior life cycle price/performance alternatives were readily available.\"   Compl. p 116-17.  As a result of \"engaging superfluous/less qualified vendors,\" NYNEX caused \"economic detriment to ratepayers and stockholders.\"  Id. The first time Hinchey elaborated on these allegations of antitrust and procurement abuse was in a deposition, where he mentioned one possible situation.  Although such behavior would be covered by the Code, we find this single shred of evidence insufficient to warrant trial.  After all, \"[T]he mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's position will be insufficient;  there must be evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for the plaintiff.\"  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is quite clear on the fact that Hinchey spoke his mind on a variety of issues, without regard for the animosity or tension he created in so doing.  His inclination toward complaining is evident.  The fact that, on one single occasion, he complained to Castellano about behavior covered by the Code is not sufficient to support a plausible assertion of reliance in the face of a plethora of complaints concerning situations not covered by the Code.  In light of all the evidence, no rational juror could find that Hinchey relied on the 1983 Code in making his complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts courts recognize an exception to the general at-will employment rule \"when employment is terminated contrary to a well-defined public policy.\"  Wright v.

A plaintiff in these kinds of cases, however, must provide evidence--not mere assertion or speculation--supporting his claim that he was terminated for reporting criminal conduct to his superior.  See id.   Hinchey may well have established evidence sufficient for a jury to find that NYNEX terminated him based on the countless complaints he made and the animosity those complaints caused.  Despite his assertions, however, there is nothing in the record demonstrating that Hinchey was terminated for reporting criminal conduct.

The first allegation involved Castellano's pre-termination promise of a separation plan including net credited service.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  As we have noted, supra, Hinchey specifically informed Castellano that he was no longer interested in that plan.  Accordingly, Hinchey cannot claim that he reasonably relied on a promise he rejected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second allegation of misrepresentation involved Castellano's statement that Hinchey was a valued employee in good standing.  Again, Hinchey has not met his burden of demonstrating reasonable reliance.  As discussed in section IV, supra, Hinchey's assertion that he suspended higher-level review of his 1992 evaluation and terminated his search for employment are unsupported by evidence.  After being informed by Castellano of his good standing at the Company on July 19, 1993, Hinchey proceeded to pursue a meeting with Seidenberg in order to discuss how the poor evaluation and lack of promotion had wounded his reputation and his chances of finding employment.  Hinchey has adduced no evidence that he would have acted any differently had Castellano not made the good-standing statement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VII.</p>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the standards for summary judgment are highly favorable to the nonmoving party, the nonmovant plaintiff still has a burden to produce evidence sufficient for a reasonable juror to find in his favor.  Given the dearth of evidence on each of the seventeen claims, we find that Hinchey has not met that burden.  The record abounds with conclusory statements and unsupported allegations, but nothing which would warrant a jury trial.  While we may sympathize with an employee who devoted his time, effort, and talent to one company for twenty-eight years, we cannot accord him legal redress where it is unwarranted.  Accordingly, the district court's grant of summary judgment to NYNEX is,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Massachusetts, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> At the time of plaintiff's termination, New England Telephone (\"NET\") and New York Telephone (\"NYT\") were wholly-owned subsidiaries of NYNEX Corporation.  Telesector Resources Group, Inc. is a subsidiary of both NET and NYT. The defendants will be referred to collectively as \"NYNEX\" or \"the Company.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The IMDP is a training regimen for employees who have been identified as being potentially qualified for management positions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Because the Appendix does not contain consecutive page numbers, we are unable to cite to specific pages in the Appendix</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Hinchey argues on appeal that the district judge incorrectly classified his employment at NYNEX as being at-will, even after the judge determined that neither the Code nor the FMP functioned as contracts.  He asserts that his participation in the IMDP (Initial Management Development Program) secured him \"guaranteed employment except under very limited circumstances.\"   Although it is clear that Hinchey has not provided sufficient evidence of such guaranteed employment, see Boothby v. Texon, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106235\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106235/boothby-v-texon-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">468</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2106235\"><a href=\"/opinion/2106235/boothby-v-texon-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></a></span>, 1034 (1993);  Rydman v.

If Hinchey believed that NYNEX violated his IMDP contract, then he should have alleged that breach as a cause of action.  Because he merely mentions it in passing, the IMDP contract is not properly before us</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> On appeal, Hinchey asserts that he is relying solely upon the 1983 version of the Code in this count.  His complaint and deposition testimony, however, state differently.  Despite this confusion, our result would be the same for the 1992 and 1993 revisions, both of which expressly disclaimed any contractual obligations</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Hinchey does not allege that Castellano's post-termination promise constituted a misrepresentation.  See Compl. p 110</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Hinchey's final claims regarding intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress need not be analyzed.  Under Massachusetts law, such actions are barred by the exclusivity provision of the Massachusetts Workers' Compensation Act.  Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 152, &#167; 24 (West Supp.1998), construed in Green v. Wyman-Gordon Co., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">664</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></span>, 813-14 (1996).  These actions are not barred, however, if an employee gave written notice to his employer that he was retaining his right of action.  See chapter 152, &#167; 24.  Hinchey has not alleged that he took any steps to retain this right</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
