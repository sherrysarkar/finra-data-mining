Hector M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Boudin, Stahl and Lynch,\r\n                    Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Melba N. Rivera-Camacho and Melba N. Rivera Camacho &amp; Assocs.on brief for appellant.\r\n Honorable Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Lilliam\r\nMendoza Toro, Assistant United States Attorney, and Donna McCarthy,\r\nAssistant Regional Counsel, Social Security Administration, Office\r\nof the General Counsel, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nJune 18, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Appellant Zoraida Cruz Cajigas (\"Cruz\")\r\nappeals from the district court's judgment upholding the denial\r\nof her application for Social Security disability benefits.  We\r\nremand for further consideration consistent with this opinion. \r\n          In October 1993, Cruz filed an application for\r\ndisability benefits, based on pinched nerves in her hands, neck\r\npain, lower back pain radiating to her leg, and muscle spasms.   \r\nIn support of her claim, she submitted medical records dating\r\nfrom April 1993 to June 1994 showing her treatment for back and\r\nneck pain and muscle spasms.  Her application was denied\r\ninitially in April 1994 and on reconsideration in August 1994. \r\nAt a hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\"), Cruz\r\ntestified about her various impairments and symptoms and\r\nsubmitted medical evidence showing that she had had carpal\r\ntunnel surgery in October 1994.\r\n   The ALJ concluded that Cruz was not disabled.  In\r\naddition to other medical evidence, he relied on a residual\r\nfunctional capacity (\"RFC\") assessment by a nonexamining\r\nconsulting physician, which had been based on the medical\r\nevidence relating to Cruz's back and neck condition.  While\r\nthis physician believed that Cruz could perform medium\r\nexertional work, the ALJ partially credited her testimony at\r\nthe hearing, determining that she could only perform the\r\nexertional requirements of light unskilled work.  He stated\r\nthat Cruz could not perform her past work of sewing shoes by\r\nhand \"due to the good manual dexterity requirements of the\r\njob.\"  Citing the Medical-Vocational Guidelines as a framework\r\nfor his decision, he concluded that Cruz was not disabled,\r\nstating that \"[m]ost light work does not require good manual\r\ndexterity[.]\"\r\n   The Appeals Council denied review and Cruz filed an\r\naction in federal district court seeking review of the ALJ's\r\ndecision.  Her primary contention was that substantial evidence\r\ndid not support the determination that she could do light work. \r\nConcluding that substantial evidence supported the denial of\r\nbenefits, the district court affirmed the decision, and Cruz\r\nappealed to this court.\r\n   On appeal, she again asserts principally that\r\nsubstantial evidence did not support the ALJ's determination\r\nthat she could perform light work.  We think the district court\r\ncorrectly rejected that claim as it related to the back and\r\nneck condition.  While there was medical evidence on that\r\ncondition which might have supported a determination that Cruz\r\nwas disabled, there was also medical evidence which would\r\nsupport a different conclusion.  For example, while a physician\r\nwho had treated Cruz for her back and neck pain had expressed\r\nthe opinion that, exertionally, she was \"severely limited,\" the\r\nCommissioner's consulting physician had determined, after\r\nreviewing her medical record, that she could perform medium\r\nwork.  Since the treating physician had treated Cruz for only\r\nseveral months and had not considered the diagnostic\r\nexaminations, showing an essentially normal spine and\r\nextremities, which had been considered by the consulting\r\nphysician, we cannot say that the ALJ unreasonably discounted\r\nthe treating physician's functional assessment.      \r\n   Nonetheless, we are troubled by one aspect of this\r\ncase: the apparent determination by the ALJ that Cruz lacked\r\ngood manual dexterity, but could perform light unskilled work. \r\nCruz did not squarely present this issue for our consideration,\r\nas clearly as she could have, but she did object that the\r\nconsulting physician had not considered her carpal tunnel\r\nsyndrome in assessing her RFC, and she did assert that the\r\nALJ's determination that she could no longer perform her prior\r\nlight work of sewing shoes by hand conflicted with his\r\ndetermination that she could perform other light work.  Since\r\ndisability proceedings are nonadversarial, we give her the\r\nbenefit of the doubt on this point and conclude that her\r\narguments suffice to preserve this issue for our review.  \r\n   Unfortunately, as the record now stands, it is hard\r\nto evaluate this potentially significant claim.  As indicated,\r\nthe ALJ apparently found that Cruz lacked good manual\r\ndexterity, but he did not explain why this was so, and the\r\nevidence of record on that issue is limited and equivocal.  At\r\nthe hearing, Cruz submitted medical evidence showing her\r\nsurgery for carpal tunnel syndrome, a condition which\r\napparently arose only after the Commissioner had a consulting\r\nphysician examine her relative to her other impairments and\r\nafter the Commissioner had solicited an RFC assessment of those\r\nother impairments.  By itself, the evidence of past carpal\r\ntunnel surgery is inconclusive and may or may not point to a\r\ndexterity problem.  If credited, however, Cruz's hearing\r\ntestimony might support a conclusion of inadequate hand\r\ndexterity.    If Cruz has a loss in dexterity, it could affect\r\nher ability to perform light unskilled work.  See Soc. Sec.\r\nRul. 83-14 ( \"many\" unskilled light jobs require the gross use\r\nof the hands to grasp, hold and turn objects); Soc. Sec. Rul.\r\n85-15 (the ability to work with the whole hand, e.g., to seize,\r\nhold, grasp and turn, is required in almost all jobs). \r\n   In the absence of subsidiary findings by the ALJ, we\r\nare therefore uncertain about the extent of the dexterity\r\nproblem perceived by the ALJ and whether it would in fact\r\npermit Cruz to perform light unskilled work.   Lest there be\r\nany injustice, we think it appropriate to remand to the ALJ for\r\nfurther consideration and explanation, including, in the ALJ's\r\ndiscretion, the taking of further medical evidence and\r\ntestimony by a vocational expert, should the degree of\r\nimpairment warrant it.  Our remand intimates no opinion as to\r\nwhat the outcome should be:  the ALJ remains free to determine,\r\nafter further consideration consistent with this opinion, that\r\nCruz's hand condition is not disabling.  We remand solely to\r\npermit further consideration of, and explanation concerning,\r\nthis narrow issue, which lacked adequate development, having\r\narisen after the Commissioner had obtained medical evidence and\r\nevaluations on Cruz's other impairments.\r\n   The decision of the district court is vacated and the\r\ndistrict court is directed to enter an order remanding the case\r\nto the Commissioner of Social Security for further proceedings\r\nin accordance with this opinion.\n",
