This case,\r\n\nhowever, varies  the usual setting  in which  courts and  cameras\r\n\ncoalesce, for our interest lies behind the television screen.  In\r\n\npursuing that interest, we entertain today a question familiar to\r\n\na generation of television viewers:  \"Who's the Boss?\"\r\n\n          The  script for  this  episode  features  Telemundo  of\r\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc. (the  Company), which petitions to set  aside a\r\n\nfinal order  of the  National Labor  Relations Board  (the Board)\r\n\ndetermining that  it unlawfully refused to  recognize and bargain\r\n\nwith the Uni n de Periodistas, Artes Gr ficas Y Ramas Anexas (the\r\n\nUnion).   The Board cross-petitions for  enforcement of its order\r\n\npursuant  to  the National  Labor  Relations Act  (the  Act), and\r\n\nspecifically, 29 U.S.C.    160(e),  (f) (1994).   We enforce  the\r\n\norder.\r\n\nI.  SETTING THE LIGHTS\r          I.  SETTING THE LIGHTS\r\n\n          Telemundo operates a  television station  in Hato  Rey,\r\n\nPuerto Rico.   In December of  1994, the Union  (which appears in\r\n\nthis  venue as  an  intervenor) sought  to  be certified  as  the\r\n\nexclusive collective  bargaining representative of a   tiny group\r\n\nof  Company  employees  known   as  technical  directors   (TDs).\r\n\nTelemundo  opposed   the  effort,   casting  the  three   TDs  as\r\n\nsupervisors (and, thus, part of management).  Agents of the Board\r\n\nconducted  a  representation  proceeding  at which  evidence  was\r\n\ntaken.   The  record was closed  in April  1995.   On January 30,\r\n\n1996,  the regional director issued a decision finding the TDs to\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nbe run-of-the-mill  employees, not supervisors, and  mandating an\r\n\nelection  (to take place on  February 28, 1996)  for a bargaining\r\n\nunit composed solely of the three TDs.\r\n\n          On February 12, the Company sought  reconsideration; it\r\n\nfiled a  request for review  and annexed  to the papers  a letter\r\n\ndated  May 15, 1995, in which  it had informed the TDs' immediate\r\n\nsuperior, Rafael Corps, that  his position   technical supervisor\r\n\n(TS)   was to be eliminated effective June 16, 1995.  On February\r\n\n28, the three TDs voted unanimously to join the Union.  The Board\r\n\ndenied  the Company's  request  for  review  two days  later  and\r\n\nthereafter   certified  the  Union   as  the   bargaining  unit's\r\n\nrepresentative.\r\n\n          It is common ground that employers cannot obtain direct\r\n\nreview  of  unfavorable  certification decisions.    See American\r                                                                           \r\n\nFed'n   of  Labor   v.  NLRB,   308  U.S.  401,   409-11  (1940).\r                                      \r\n\nConsequently, if an employer is dissatisfied  with the outcome of\r\n\na representation proceeding, the option of choice is to refuse to\r\n\nbargain and to raise any  infirmity in the certification decision\r\n\nas  a defense  to the  unfair labor  practice charge  that almost\r\n\ninevitably  will ensue.  See, e.g., Boire v. Greyhound Corp., 376\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. 473, 477 (1964); S.D. Warren  Co. v. NLRB, 342 F.2d 814, 815\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1965).   So here:   the Company stonewalled, the  Union\r\n\npressed an unfair labor practice charge, and the Company defended\r\n\non the  ground that the bargaining unit was inappropriate because\r\n\nthe TDs were supervisors.   As part of this defense, the  Company\r\n\nasked the Board to pay special heed to (1) the letter eliminating\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nthe  technical  supervisor's  position,   and  (2)  an  affidavit\r\n\nexecuted well after the election by Elizabeth Rivera, a member of\r\n\nmanagement, purporting to describe changes in the TDs' duties.\r\n\n          The General  Counsel moved  for summary judgment.   The\r\n\nBoard obliged,  rejecting the proffered  affidavit, upholding the\r\n\nunderlying certification, and  ruling that the  Company's refusal\r\n\nto bargain  violated the Act.   See Telemundo of  P.R., Inc., 321\r                                                                      \r\n\nNLRB No. 133,  slip op. (NLRB Aug. 16, 1996).   These proceedings\r\n\nfollowed apace.\r\n\nII.  ASSEMBLING THE CAST\r          II.  ASSEMBLING THE CAST\r\n\n          The employees in the bargaining unit are members of the\r\n\nCompany's   production  services   department,   which  has   the\r\n\nresponsibility for  producing live  and taped telecasts.   During\r\n\nthe  pendency of  the representation  proceeding,  the department\r\n\ncomprised,  inter  alia,  the director  (Rivera),  the  technical\r                                 \r\n\nsupervisor (Corps), three program directors, three TDs, audio and\r\n\nlighting persons, and  eighteen studio  technicians.   Typically,\r\n\nthe  TS prepared  a  daily schedule  delineating which  employees\r\n\nwould work on which  programs and establishing a specific  set of\r\n\nresponsibilities  for  three  crews,  each headed  by  a  TD  and\r\n\nincluding  technicians  (e.g.,  cameramen,  a  floor  manager  or\r\n\ncoordinator, audio  and lighting  persons, a  character generator\r\n\noperator) assigned to the crew by the TS.\r\n\n          In the pre-production stage, the  crew's activities are\r\n\ndictated  for  the  most part  by  the  script  for the  upcoming\r\n\nprogram.   The TD is  given the script,  sometimes called a  run-\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ndown,  and it is incumbent upon him  to ensure that the studio is\r\n\nprepared  for production  according to  the script  and that  all\r\n\nhands  are present  and in  their places.   When  the performance\r\n\nbegins,  a  program director  takes over  and  the TD  retires to\r\n\noperate the camera control panels in the control room.  Some crew\r\n\nmembers work in the control room alongside the TD; others work on\r\n\nthe floor.\r\n\n          After the performance  ends, the TD again comes  to the\r\n\nfore; in the  course of an approximately  30-minute process known\r\n\nas the  wrap, the TD and  his crew store the  equipment and other\r\n\nprogramming paraphernalia  in the control  room.  All  three TDs,\r\n\nbut no studio technicians, possess keys to the control room, and,\r\n\nafter  the equipage is stored,  the TD assumes responsibility for\r\n\nlocking the  room.  The TD also prepares and files a daily report\r\n\nwhich   memorializes  the   crew's  membership,   catalogues  the\r\n\nequipment used  during production, and relates  any problems that\r\n\noccurred with  regard  to either  personnel  or equipment.    The\r\n\nprogram director  and the  floor coordinator likewise  file daily\r\n\nreports.\r\n\n          To achieve a balanced picture,  it is important to note\r\n\nwhat TDs  do not  do.  They  ordinarily do not  make disciplinary\r\n\nrecommendations  in their  daily reports;  rather, the  technical\r\n\nsupervisor  reads the  reports  and  takes whatever  disciplinary\r\n\naction  he thinks is appropriate.  The TDs neither participate in\r\n\nthe  disciplining  of  errant  employees  nor   perform  employee\r\n\nevaluations.   They do  not interview, hire,  promote, demote, or\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nterminate  other   workers.     They  do  not   address  employee\r\n\ngrievances.\r\n\n          As in  any workplace, absenteeism  occurs.   In a  TD's\r\n\nabsence,  another TD or the TS will replace him.  Technicians who\r\n\nfind  themselves  unable to  work must  inform  the TS,  who will\r\n\nsecure a replacement.  If neither the department director nor the\r\n\nTS is at the station (as frequently occurs on weekends, holidays,\r\n\nand  during some night shifts),  a TD may  be the highest-ranking\r\n\nemployee  on the  premises.   As  such,  he will  recruit  needed\r\n\nsubstitutes  from another  crew or  from a  list composed  by the\r\n\ntechnical supervisor and posted in the production office.  The TS\r\n\noften will \"pop in\" on such occasions, and, in any event, the TDs\r\n\nhave the home telephone  numbers of both the director and the TS,\r\n\nand they are under instructions  to call either or both of  these\r\n\nindividuals in case of an emergency.\r\n\n          The  TDs have some trappings of a higher echelon.  They\r\n\nreceive  more  munificent salaries,  larger  bonuses,  and better\r\n\nbenefits than the studio technicians.  They rate reserved parking\r\n\nspaces  and separate  desks (albeit  in a  common office).   They\r\n\noccasionally  have been  invited to attend  supervisors' meetings\r\n\n(including  a  few  meetings   at  which  collective   bargaining\r\n\nnegotiations were  discussed).  Sporadically, TDs  have initiated\r\n\nmeetings among technical  personnel    but they do  not have  the\r\n\npower to  follow through  on such  initiatives  unassisted.   For\r\n\ninstance,  when a  TD  notified Rivera  of  his wish  to  discuss\r\n\ntardiness,  work   habits,  and   care  of  equipment   with  the\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ntechnicians in his crew, Rivera called such a meeting and the  TD\r\n\nran it.  On  another occasion, a TD drafted (but did  not send) a\r\n\nmemorandum  requesting  that technical  personnel  report  to the\r\n\nstudios  at the entry time set by  management even if they had no\r\n\nassigned  work then  and  there.   Rivera  rewrote the  memo  for\r\n\nsignature  by the  TS  and the  TD, adding  a reminder  about the\r\n\npossible consequences of noncompliance.\r\n\nIII.  THE RATINGS\r          III.  THE RATINGS\r\n\n          In rating the Board's  performance, we first review its\r\n\ndetermination that the TDs are not supervisors.\r\n\n                     A.  Receiving Our Cues.\r                               A.  Receiving Our Cues.\r                                                     \r\n\n          To put this case into perspective, it bears remembering\r\n\nthat  the  Act  strives  to  limn  a  clear  distinction  between\r\n\nmanagement  and labor.   To that  end, supervisory  employees are\r\n\nexcluded from the bargaining  process because they must represent\r\n\nthe  interests  of their  employer rather  than the  interests of\r\n\ntheir coworkers.  See Stop  &amp; Shop Cos. v. NLRB, 548  F.2d 17, 19\r                                                         \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1977).    The  Act  defines  a  \"supervisor\"  as  \"any\r\n\nindividual having authority, in the interest of the employer,  to\r\n\nhire, transfer,  suspend, lay  off,  recall, promote,  discharge,\r\n\nassign, reward, or discipline  other employees, or responsibly to\r\n\ndirect them,  or to  adjust their  grievances, or effectively  to\r\n\nrecommend  such action, if  in connection with  the foregoing the\r\n\nexercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical\r\n\nnature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\"  29 U.S.C.\r\n\n  152(11).  Because the statute is to be read in the disjunctive,\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\nany one of the enumerated powers may signify supervisory  status.\r\n\nSee  Northeast Utils. Serv. Corp. v. NLRB,  35 F.3d 621, 624 (1st\r                                                   \r\n\nCir.  1994), cert. denied, 115  S.

Thus,  even an\r\n\nenumerated  power  must  involve  the   exercise  of  independent\r\n\njudgment  in  order  to  brand  the  holder of  the  power  as  a\r\n\nsupervisor.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The derivation of the term \"straw boss\" bears mentioning:\r\n\n          In the  early days of logging  in mountainous\r\n          country  straw  was  spread  upon  slopes too\r\n          steep for horses to hold back  a sled load of\r\n          logs   but  not   so  steep  as   to  require\r\n          \"bridling,\"  i.e., looping a  short length of\r\n          chain around a sled runner to drag underneath\r\n          it, or  holding the load  back by means  of a\r\n          long rope  attached to  the rear of  the sled\r\n          and wound  once or twice  (snubbed) around  a\r\n          stump  at the  top  of the  slope to  provide\r\n          friction.   After each  passage, sometimes at\r\n          full gallop  to keep the horses  ahead of the\r\n          load, the  straw was naturally displaced so a\r\n          man with a pitchfork was posted at each slope\r\n          to   keep   the  straw   evenly  distributed.\r\n          Although teamsters were men of consequence in\r\n          the lumber camps, the rule was that they were\r\n          not  to  start down  a  slope  until the  far\r\n          humbler functionary with  a pitchfork,  using\r\n          his \"independent judgment,\" passed  word that\r\n          the  slope  was  prepared.    Hence the  term\r\n          \"straw boss.\"\r\n\nNLRB v.

Addressing the Studio Audience.\r                                                           \r\n\n          The   Company  contends  that   the  Board  engaged  in\r\n\npiecemeal  analysis  and  ignored  overwhelming  record  evidence\r\n\nindicating that TDs responsibly direct studio technicians.  After\r\n\ncarefully  examining   the  entire   record,  we  conclude   that\r\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the  Board's determination that the\r\n\nthree TDs are ordinary employees, not supervisors.\r\n\n          The linchpin of this  assessment is that, as the  Board\r\n\npointed out, the  primary responsibilities of  the TDs relate  to\r\n\nsafeguarding equipment,  ensuring that the crew  is positioned in\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\naccordance with  the script,  performing actual  production work,\r\n\nand  documenting  the  events  (or  nonevents)  incident  to  the\r\n\nproduction of  particular programs.  Although  these duties carry\r\n\nresponsibilities greater than those borne by  studio technicians,\r\n\nthey do not require  the exercise of independent judgment  in any\r\n\nlegally meaningful sense.\r\n\n          Certainly,  superintending the  maintenance and  use of\r\n\nequipment is not commonly thought to be a supervisory function or\r\n\nto require managerial authority.   See Maine Yankee, 624  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n361-62.   Similarly, the mere  fact that an  employee gives other\r\n\nemployees  instructions  from time  to time  does  not in  and of\r\n\nitself render him a supervisor for purposes of the Act.  See Stop\r                                                                           \r\n\n&amp; Shop, 548 F.2d at 19.  Rather, the portent of that fact depends\r                \r\n\non the relative significance of the instructions given.  See id.;\r                                                                          \r\n\nsee also Goldies, 628 F.2d at 710.  In this situation, the TDs do\r                          \r\n\nlittle  more than  implement  the instructions  contained in  the\r\n\nprogram's  script.  Moreover, because each technician has his own\r\n\nassignment and performs repetitive tasks  day after day, the crew\r\n\nmembers require  minimal supervision.  Viewed in  the totality of\r\n\nthe  circumstances,  the TDs'  orders  are  both perfunctory  and\r\n\nroutine.   Thus, the instructions,  evaluated in context,  do not\r\n\nfairly  indicate  that  the   instructors  possess  authority  to\r\n\nexercise independent judgment in overseeing other employees.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nNLRB v.

See Fall  River Sav. Bank v.  NLRB, 649\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 50, 54  (1st Cir. 1981).   And, here, the  additional duties\r\n\nperformed by  the TDs  on those occasions  are mundane.   None of\r\n\nthem necessitates supervisory authority for its  due performance.\r\n\nThe technical  supervisor, not the  TD, is  responsible for  work\r\n\nassignments  and replacements;  only when  the TS  is unavailable\r\n\ndoes the TD locate substitutes, and, even then, the TD must refer\r\n\nto  a  list  of names  prepared  by  the  TS.   This  function   \r\n\nirregular, mechanical, and devoid  of independent judgment   does\r\n\nnot constitute  true authority  to assign work.2   See  Northeast\r                                                                           \r\n\nUtils., 35 F.3d at  625; Highland Superstores, Inc. v.

See,  e.g., Stop  &amp; Shop,  548 F.2d  at 20;  NLRB v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMagnesium Casting Co., 427  F.2d 114, 117 (1st Cir.),  aff'd, 401\r                                                                      \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2This  conclusion   is  fortified  by  the   fact  that  the\r\ndepartment  director  and the  TS are  on  call, and  the Company\r\nprovides the TDs with their home telephone numbers for use  if an\r\nemergency arises.  See North Shore Weeklies, Inc., 317 NLRB 1128,\r                                                           \r\n1131 (1995); Ball Plastics Div., 228 NLRB 633, 634 (1977).\r                                         \r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nU.S. 137 (1970).   The reports are merely informational;  the TDs\r\n\ndo not  effectively recommend  disciplinary action  by completing\r\n\nthe forms.  Thus,  even though the information conveyed  in these\r\n\nreports sometimes may lead to the imposition of discipline, it is\r\n\nnot the writers who make  the call.  Even on those  few occasions\r\n\nwhen the TDs have submitted recommendations, their superiors have\r\n\nexercised independent  judgment in  deciding whether (and  if so,\r\n\nwhat) disciplinary action is warranted.  In these respects, then,\r\n\nthe  TDs are  mere scriveners    and acting  as an  amanuensis or\r\n\notherwise  fulfilling a  purely  reportorial function  is not  an\r\n\nindicium of  supervisory status.   See Highland  Superstores, 927\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  922.   The evidence  as to meetings  is also  subject to\r\n\nconflicting  inferences.   To  be sure,  the  TDs attended  a few\r\n\nmeetings  for supervisors   but  many such meetings  were held to\r\n\nwhich  they were not invited.  And when they attempted to arrange\r\n\ntechnicians' meetings, they were stymied unless they received the\r\n\nblessing of Rivera and Corps.\r\n\n          We  do not mean to imply that the evidence is one-sided\r\n\nor  that the  pivotal question  is free  from doubt.   There  are\r\n\nseveral evidentiary trails in the record, some leading toward one\r\n\ndestination at which the Board arrived and some leading away from\r\n\nit.  Some of the factors which we have discussed argue in varying\r\n\ndegrees  for supervisory status    the  TDs' hegemony  at certain\r\n\ntimes,  their pay  level, the  giving of instructions  to others,\r\n\noccasionally  passing out work  assignments, filing  reports, and\r\n\nattending  meetings   but many of them are double-edged.  Just as\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nimportant,  the Board  considered the  collective force  of these\r\n\nfactors and rejected the inference hawked by the Company in favor\r\n\nof  a different, equally supported inference.   On reflection, we\r\n\ncannot say that the Board's choice was arbitrary or capricious.\r\n\n          In a last-ditch effort to save the show, the petitioner\r\n\nflips  to another channel.   It urges that  Maine Yankee requires\r                                                                  \r\n\noverturning the  Board's decision  here.   We do not  agree.   In\r\n\nMaine Yankee, the Board  decided that shift operating supervisors\r                      \r\n\nat  a nuclear  power plant  were not  statutory supervisors.   We\r\n\nreversed.  624  F.2d at 366.  Because the shift supervisors would\r\n\nhave  to answer  for anything  that went  wrong with  the plant's\r\n\nelectrical  output, management  held  them fully  accountable and\r\n\nresponsible for  the  employees'  performance,  and,  thus,  they\r\n\npossessed authority  responsibly to direct other  employees.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.  at 360-61; see also NLRB v. J.K.

Here,  however, the  record  contains  no\r\n\ncompelling  evidence  that  a  TD  is  held  accountable  for the\r\n\nadequate  performance  of  the   crew's  technical  work.    This\r\n\ndistinction  makes a world of difference.   See Northeast Utils.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n35 F.3d  at 625  (distinguishing Maine  Yankee in excluding  from\r                                                        \r\n\nsupervisory status coordinators who  were not responsible for the\r\n\nactions of other employees).\r\n\n          The Company  also claims  that Maine Yankee  bears upon\r                                                               \r\n\nthe  question  of  whether  TDs  perforce  exercise   independent\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\njudgment because they cannot always reach the department director\r\n\nor   the  technical   supervisor  by   telephone  for   emergency\r\n\nconsultation.  But Maine Yankee reflects a vastly different plot.\r                                         \r\n\nIn  that case, the panel  emphasized the complexity, variety, and\r\n\ndangerousness of operational duties at an atomic power plant, 624\r\n\nF.2d at 361  &amp; n.14,  363, and distinguished  a shift  supervisor\r\n\nthere    who had to initiate remedial measures quickly whether or\r\n\nnot he could reach his superiors   from \"a dispatcher who assigns\r\n\nemployees  and equipment  according to  a relatively  simple pre-\r\n\nprogrammed plan\" developed by the employer, id. at 363.  There is\r                                                         \r\n\nno evidence  in the  instant record  of comparable  complexity or\r\n\ndangerousness, nor is  there evidence that a TD  may have to make\r\n\nemergency  decisions on hazardous    or even intricate   matters.\r\n\nIndeed, the  only  relevant proof  relates to  decisions such  as\r\n\nwhether  to  proceed  with two  cameras  instead  of  three if  a\r\n\ncameraman is missing.  Under these circumstances, we cannot fault\r\n\nthe  Board's conclusion  that the  TDs  act more  as dispatchers,\r\n\nperforming routine tasks  and conveying boilerplate instructions,\r\n\nthan as supervisors.   And, moreover,  the Board's conclusion  is\r\n\nwholly consistent with the  TDs' stated self-perception that they\r\n\nare crew leaders, no more.\r\n\n          To conclude,  there is  a fine  line between the  upper\r\n\nstrata  of  employees  and  the lowest  rungs  of  the management\r\n\nladder.   We freely acknowledge that the  Board, had it chosen to\r\n\nweight the TDs' responsibilities differently, could  have reached\r\n\nthe opposite result.   The question is admittedly close,  yet its\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\nvery closeness  argues persuasively in favor of  deference to the\r\n\nBoard.  It is  particularly in the close  cases that judges,  who\r\n\nare generalists, should respect  the specialized knowledge of the\r\n\nBoard  and accede to its factbound determinations as long as they\r\n\nare rooted in the record.  See Universal Camera, 340 U.S. at 488.\r                                                         \r\n\nPut  bluntly, courts  must  be careful  not  to substitute  their\r\n\njudgments  for the  Board's  where, on  whole-record review,  the\r\n\nevidence supports any of  several views and the Board  has chosen\r\n\namong them.

The  Company's  request  hinges  on  the  import  of\r\n\ncircumstances that allegedly have  arisen since the conclusion of\r\n\nthe  representation hearing:   the  elimination of  the technical\r\n\nsupervisor's  position, the  ostensible transfer  of some  of his\r\n\nduties to  the TDs, and the inclusion of the  TDs as members of a\r\n\nfledgling  evaluation   committee.    This   initiative  squarely\r\n\npresents   the   question   of   when   changes   in   employment\r\n\nresponsibilities    require    reexamination   of    an   earlier\r\n\ndetermination of employee status.\r\n\n                    A.

The evidence concerning the  elimination of Corps'\r                    1.\r\n\nposition as technical supervisor    the May 15 letter    requires\r\n\nscant comment.  This  letter had been submitted as  an attachment\r\n\nto the  request for  review filed  in  the wake  of the  regional\r\n\ndirector's adverse  decision  in the  representation  proceeding.\r\n\nBecause  a request for review \"may  not raise any issue or allege\r\n\nany  facts  not timely  presented to  the regional  director,\" 29\r\n\nC.F.R.    102.67(d),  the submission  of  the letter  imposed  no\r\n\nobligation on  the Board to  consider the implications  of Corps'\r\n\ntermination,  especially in the absence of a motion to reopen the\r\n\nrecord.  See generally East Mich. Care, 246 NLRB at 459 (dictum).\r                                                \r\n\n          Beyond  that pitfall,  a  second obstacle  looms.   The\r\n\nBoard, in its own  phrase, \"fully considered\" the May  15 letter.\r\n\nTelemundo, slip op. at  1 n.1.  We  think it would be curious  to\r                   \r\n\nremand  a  case  for consideration  of  evidence  that  an agency\r\n\nalready has fully considered, and we will not do so here.4\r\n\n          2.  The  more nettlesome question relates to  the claim\r                    2.\r\n\nthat the TDs had been vested with some managerial duties formerly\r\n\nhandled by  the technical supervisor and had  been assigned added\r\n\nresponsibility for evaluating other employees.  The Board's first\r\n\nnotice  of these alleged innovations came on July 16, 1996 (after\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe  bargaining  unit  had  been  certified),  when  the  Company\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Moreover,  we  readily appreciate  the  Board's  refusal to\r\nattach decretory significance to the  epistle.  The letter states\r\nonly  that the Company had  decided to eliminate  the position of\r\ntechnical  supervisor.   It  furnishes  no  indication that  this\r\nposition elimination  might  alter or  affect  the scope  of  the\r\ntechnical directors' duties.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nsubmitted,  as part  of its  reply to  the unfair  labor practice\r\n\ncharge, an affidavit executed  on May 9 by Elizabeth  Rivera, the\r\n\ndepartment director.  The Rivera affidavit claimed, for the first\r\n\ntime, that \"some administrative duties that were performed by the\r\n\nTechnical  Supervisor,  such  as  the preparation  of  the  daily\r\n\nschedules and  the revision and  approval of the  weekly payroll,\r\n\nare now performed  by the  Technical Directors.\"   The  affidavit\r\n\nalso  disclosed  that in  March 1996  the  Company had  created a\r\n\ncommittee  to evaluate  the technicians'  work and  made the  TDs\r\n\nmembers of it (thus enhancing their supervisory roles).\r\n\n          Assuming   arguendo   the   truth   of   the  Company's\r                                       \r\n\ndescription of these augmented duties, the timing gives us pause.\r\n\nWhile  Rivera's  affidavit is  strangely  silent as  to  when the\r\n\nchanges  transpired   its text  states only that  the TDs assumed\r\n\nthe  additional duties; it does  not broadcast the  time frame in\r\n\nwhich the Company  made the  reallocation    it is  transparently\r\n\nclear  that the attempted  expansion of the  TDs' job description\r\n\ntook place  at some  time  after the  record  had closed  in  the\r\n\nrepresentation proceeding.   Thus, those changes,  no matter when\r\n\nthereafter they were effectuated, do not constitute evidence that\r\n\ncan vitiate  the Board's determination  of the  propriety of  the\r\n\nbargaining unit.  It follows that the Board acted well within its\r\n\nlawful authority in refusing to entertain the proffer.\r\n\n          If an  employer could insist that evidence of this kind\r\n\nbe considered by  a reviewing  tribunal (be it  court or  agency)\r\n\nafter  the  administrative  record  had  been  closed,  then  the\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nemployer routinely  could defease  a bargaining unit  despite the\r\n\nfact that the Board had determined it to be appropriate.  Indeed,\r\n\ndoing  so would  require  no greater  effort  than modifying  the\r\n\naffected employees' duties.   Such a regime would be antithetical\r\n\nnot  only  to  the  Board's regulations  but  also  to precedent,\r\n\npolicy, and the objectives of the Act.\r\n\n          The regulatory scheme is explicit; the Board determines\r\n\nthe  appropriateness   of  a  bargaining  unit   based  upon  the\r\n\nconditions  of  employment  as they  exist  at  the  time of  the\r\n\nhearing,  and,   at  least   in  the  absence   of  extraordinary\r\n\ncircumstances,5 the  record thereafter  may be augmented  only by\r\n\nnewly discovered evidence.   See 29 C.F.R.   102.65(e)(1).   This\r                                          \r\n\nregulation limits  the  rubric  \"newly  discovered  evidence\"  to\r\n\n\"evidence  which has become available only since the close of the\r\n\nhearing,  or evidence  which the  regional director or  the Board\r\n\nbelieves  should have  been taken  at the  hearing.\"   Id.   This\r                                                                    \r\n\ndefinition effectively demarcates  the representation  proceeding\r\n\nas  the outermost  point in  time to  which evidence  can relate.\r\n\nFacts which arise only  after the hearing has been  concluded and\r                           \r\n\nthe record  closed are  irrelevant, whereas  facts which  are not\r\n\ndiscovered  until then  (but which  relate to  the time  frame at\r                    \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5We reject  out  of hand  the  Company's argument  that  the\r\nchange  in  duties here  constitutes  extraordinary circumstances\r\nrequiring  the  Board to  reexamine  the  appropriateness of  the\r\nbargaining unit.  If an employer, dissatisfied with the upshot of\r\na  representation  proceeding,  could  manufacture  circumstances\r\nsufficient to  require reconsideration simply by  shifting duties\r\naround,  then  Board certifications  would  be  little more  than\r\nhollow gestures.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nissue  in  the  hearing)  are  potentially  relevant  and  may be\r\n\nconsidered in the Board's discretion.\r\n\n          Precedent fully  supports the general  proposition that\r\n\nunilateral changes  to  employment parameters  occurring after  a\r\n\nrepresentation  hearing has  been completed  can have  no bearing\r\n\nupon the  outcome of that  proceeding.  See K-Mart,  322 NLRB No.\r                                                            \r\n\n98, slip op.  at 1 (NLRB Nov. 22,  1996) (\"If the change  was the\r\n\nresult of unilateral actions by the Respondent, it would normally\r\n\nnot be a  basis for reconsidering  the certification .  . .  .\"),\r\n\npetition for review pending (D.C. Cir., No. 96-1461); East  Mich.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCare,  246  NLRB at  459  (holding  that evidence  of  subsequent\r              \r\n\nchanges made  in the duties  of unit  employees lacked  relevance\r\n\nbecause the evidence  \"d[id] not involve  facts which existed  at\r\n\nthe  time  of  the  hearing  in  the underlying  proceeding  and,\r\n\ntherefore, d[id]  not constitute newly discovered  and previously\r\n\nunavailable evidence\").\r\n\n          This proposition also  comports with  sound policy  and\r\n\ncore purposes  of the  Act.   Affording an employer  (or a  labor\r\n\nunion, for that matter)  unilateral control over critical aspects\r\n\nof the  collective bargaining process would  dislodge the balance\r\n\nand weaken the structure  of the collective bargaining framework.\r\n\nSee Auciello Iron Works,  Inc. v. NLRB, 116 S. Ct.  1754, 1758-60\r                                                \r\n\n(1996).  What is  more, enforcing this policy furthers  the broad\r\n\nobjective of  restoring the equality of  bargaining power between\r\n\nemployers  and employees  that is  so central  to the  Act, while\r\n\nsimultaneously securing stability in labor relations.  See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\n1759; see also 29 U.S.C.   151.\r                        \r\n\n          Of   course,   the  closing   of   the   record  in   a\r\n\nrepresentation  proceeding  does not  freeze  the  duties of  the\r\n\nmembers of the proposed  bargaining unit for all time  and in all\r\n\ncircumstances.    When  the  motion  to  reopen  is  premised  on\r\n\nsubsequently  conferred  duties,   the  Board  is   warranted  in\r\n\npresuming  that such duties are irrelevant to its conclusion.  An\r\n\nemployer who  seeks to  overcome that presumption  bears a  heavy\r\n\nburden of  showing that  a legitimate business  necessity arising\r\n\nout of circumstances that were in play before the  representation\r\n\nproceeding concluded forced him to recast job descriptions.  See,\r                                                                          \r\n\ne.g.,  Frito  Lay, Inc.,  177 NLRB  820,  821 (1969)  (vacating a\r                                 \r\n\ncertification after ensuring that changes in duties were effected\r\n\npursuant to \"legitimate business  purposes, and without intent to\r\n\nevade the Respondent's obligation under the certification\").6\r\n\n          We  need  not  tarry.   The  Company  has presented  no\r\n\nevidence that  either the shifting of  the technical supervisor's\r\n\nduties or the creation of  the evaluation committee resulted from\r\n\nevents  set   in  motion  prior  to,  and   independent  of,  the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     6In Frito Lay, the Board dismissed an unfair  labor practice\r                            \r\ncomplaint,  finding that subsequent  changes attributable  to the\r\ncompany's  nationwide  reorganization  eliminated the  \"essential\r\nfactor\"  which made  the  previously certified  unit appropriate.\r\n820 NLRB at 821.  As was repeatedly underscored in the  decision,\r\nthe  employer undertook  this reorganization as  a result  of the\r\nrecommendations  provided  by a  management consultant  which had\r\nbegun  a study  of  the employer's  operations  before the  union\r                                                                \r\ninstituted the representation proceeding.  The timing enabled the\r\nBoard to find  that the  \"restructuring was clearly  not for  the\r\npurpose of  avoiding compliance  with the Board's  unit finding.\"\r\nId.  Telemundo has sketched no comparable story line.\r             \r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\nrepresentation  proceeding.    Thus, the  evidence  contained  in\r\n\nRivera's affidavit  falls well  outside the compass  of relevance\r\n\nand cannot justify a  remand for the purpose of  relitigating the\r\n\nissue of supervisory status.\r\n\n          There is,  moreover, another basis  for sustaining  the\r\n\nBoard's  order in  the  face of  the  Company's proffer.   As  we\r\n\npreviously mentioned, the evidence  is cloudy as to  exactly when\r\n\nTelemundo first  purposed to  augment the  TDs' responsibilities.\r\n\nSee supra p.  17-18.  It is, however, pellucid  that the TDs were\r                   \r\n\nnot assigned to positions on the evaluation committee until March\r\n\n1996  at  the earliest.   By  that time,  any proposed  change in\r                                \r\n\nduties that would convert unit employees to statutory supervisory\r\n\nstatus  (and thereby eliminate the  bargaining unit) had become a\r\n\nmandatory subject of collective bargaining.

This case,\r\n\nhowever, varies  the usual setting  in which  courts and  cameras\r\n\ncoalesce, for our interest lies behind the television screen.  In\r\n\npursuing that interest, we entertain today a question familiar to\r\n\na generation of television viewers:  \"Who's the Boss?\"\r\n\n          The  script for  this  episode  features  Telemundo  of\r\n\nPuerto Rico, Inc. (the  Company), which petitions to set  aside a\r\n\nfinal order  of the  National Labor  Relations Board  (the Board)\r\n\ndetermining that  it unlawfully refused to  recognize and bargain\r\n\nwith the Uni n de Periodistas, Artes Gr ficas Y Ramas Anexas (the\r\n\nUnion).   The Board cross-petitions for  enforcement of its order\r\n\npursuant  to  the National  Labor  Relations Act  (the  Act), and\r\n\nspecifically, 29 U.S.C.    160(e),  (f) (1994).   We enforce  the\r\n\norder.\r\n\nI.  SETTING THE LIGHTS\r          I.  SETTING THE LIGHTS\r\n\n          Telemundo operates a  television station  in Hato  Rey,\r\n\nPuerto Rico.   In December of  1994, the Union  (which appears in\r\n\nthis  venue as  an  intervenor) sought  to  be certified  as  the\r\n\nexclusive collective  bargaining representative of a   tiny group\r\n\nof  Company  employees  known   as  technical  directors   (TDs).\r\n\nTelemundo  opposed   the  effort,   casting  the  three   TDs  as\r\n\nsupervisors (and, thus, part of management).  Agents of the Board\r\n\nconducted  a  representation  proceeding  at which  evidence  was\r\n\ntaken.   The  record was closed  in April  1995.   On January 30,\r\n\n1996,  the regional director issued a decision finding the TDs to\r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nbe run-of-the-mill  employees, not supervisors, and  mandating an\r\n\nelection  (to take place on  February 28, 1996)  for a bargaining\r\n\nunit composed solely of the three TDs.\r\n\n          On February 12, the Company sought  reconsideration; it\r\n\nfiled a  request for review  and annexed  to the papers  a letter\r\n\ndated  May 15, 1995, in which  it had informed the TDs' immediate\r\n\nsuperior, Rafael Corps, that  his position   technical supervisor\r\n\n(TS)   was to be eliminated effective June 16, 1995.  On February\r\n\n28, the three TDs voted unanimously to join the Union.  The Board\r\n\ndenied  the Company's  request  for  review  two days  later  and\r\n\nthereafter   certified  the  Union   as  the   bargaining  unit's\r\n\nrepresentative.\r\n\n          It is common ground that employers cannot obtain direct\r\n\nreview  of  unfavorable  certification decisions.

So here:   the Company stonewalled, the  Union\r\n\npressed an unfair labor practice charge, and the Company defended\r\n\non the  ground that the bargaining unit was inappropriate because\r\n\nthe TDs were supervisors.   As part of this defense, the  Company\r\n\nasked the Board to pay special heed to (1) the letter eliminating\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\nthe  technical  supervisor's  position,   and  (2)  an  affidavit\r\n\nexecuted well after the election by Elizabeth Rivera, a member of\r\n\nmanagement, purporting to describe changes in the TDs' duties.\r\n\n          The General  Counsel moved  for summary judgment.   The\r\n\nBoard obliged,  rejecting the proffered  affidavit, upholding the\r\n\nunderlying certification, and  ruling that the  Company's refusal\r\n\nto bargain  violated the Act.   See Telemundo of  P.R., Inc., 321\r                                                                      \r\n\nNLRB No. 133,  slip op. (NLRB Aug. 16, 1996).   These proceedings\r\n\nfollowed apace.\r\n\nII.  ASSEMBLING THE CAST\r          II.  ASSEMBLING THE CAST\r\n\n          The employees in the bargaining unit are members of the\r\n\nCompany's   production  services   department,   which  has   the\r\n\nresponsibility for  producing live  and taped telecasts.   During\r\n\nthe  pendency of  the representation  proceeding,  the department\r\n\ncomprised,  inter  alia,  the director  (Rivera),  the  technical\r                                 \r\n\nsupervisor (Corps), three program directors, three TDs, audio and\r\n\nlighting persons, and  eighteen studio  technicians.   Typically,\r\n\nthe  TS prepared  a  daily schedule  delineating which  employees\r\n\nwould work on which  programs and establishing a specific  set of\r\n\nresponsibilities  for  three  crews,  each headed  by  a  TD  and\r\n\nincluding  technicians  (e.g.,  cameramen,  a  floor  manager  or\r\n\ncoordinator, audio  and lighting  persons, a  character generator\r\n\noperator) assigned to the crew by the TS.\r\n\n          In the pre-production stage, the  crew's activities are\r\n\ndictated  for  the  most part  by  the  script  for the  upcoming\r\n\nprogram.   The TD is  given the script,  sometimes called a  run-\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\ndown,  and it is incumbent upon him  to ensure that the studio is\r\n\nprepared  for production  according to  the script  and that  all\r\n\nhands  are present  and in  their places.   When  the performance\r\n\nbegins,  a  program director  takes over  and  the TD  retires to\r\n\noperate the camera control panels in the control room.  Some crew\r\n\nmembers work in the control room alongside the TD; others work on\r\n\nthe floor.\r\n\n          After the performance  ends, the TD again comes  to the\r\n\nfore; in the  course of an approximately  30-minute process known\r\n\nas the  wrap, the TD and  his crew store the  equipment and other\r\n\nprogramming paraphernalia  in the control  room.  All  three TDs,\r\n\nbut no studio technicians, possess keys to the control room, and,\r\n\nafter  the equipage is stored,  the TD assumes responsibility for\r\n\nlocking the  room.  The TD also prepares and files a daily report\r\n\nwhich   memorializes  the   crew's  membership,   catalogues  the\r\n\nequipment used  during production, and relates  any problems that\r\n\noccurred with  regard  to either  personnel  or equipment.    The\r\n\nprogram director  and the  floor coordinator likewise  file daily\r\n\nreports.\r\n\n          To achieve a balanced picture,  it is important to note\r\n\nwhat TDs  do not  do.  They  ordinarily do not  make disciplinary\r\n\nrecommendations  in their  daily reports;  rather, the  technical\r\n\nsupervisor  reads the  reports  and  takes whatever  disciplinary\r\n\naction  he thinks is appropriate.  The TDs neither participate in\r\n\nthe  disciplining  of  errant  employees  nor   perform  employee\r\n\nevaluations.   They do  not interview, hire,  promote, demote, or\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nterminate  other   workers.     They  do  not   address  employee\r\n\ngrievances.\r\n\n          As in  any workplace, absenteeism  occurs.   In a  TD's\r\n\nabsence,  another TD or the TS will replace him.  Technicians who\r\n\nfind  themselves  unable to  work must  inform  the TS,  who will\r\n\nsecure a replacement.  If neither the department director nor the\r\n\nTS is at the station (as frequently occurs on weekends, holidays,\r\n\nand  during some night shifts),  a TD may  be the highest-ranking\r\n\nemployee  on the  premises.   As  such,  he will  recruit  needed\r\n\nsubstitutes  from another  crew or  from a  list composed  by the\r\n\ntechnical supervisor and posted in the production office.  The TS\r\n\noften will \"pop in\" on such occasions, and, in any event, the TDs\r\n\nhave the home telephone  numbers of both the director and the TS,\r\n\nand they are under instructions  to call either or both of  these\r\n\nindividuals in case of an emergency.\r\n\n          The  TDs have some trappings of a higher echelon.  They\r\n\nreceive  more  munificent salaries,  larger  bonuses,  and better\r\n\nbenefits than the studio technicians.  They rate reserved parking\r\n\nspaces  and separate  desks (albeit  in a  common office).   They\r\n\noccasionally  have been  invited to attend  supervisors' meetings\r\n\n(including  a  few  meetings   at  which  collective   bargaining\r\n\nnegotiations were  discussed).  Sporadically, TDs  have initiated\r\n\nmeetings among technical  personnel    but they do  not have  the\r\n\npower to  follow through  on such  initiatives  unassisted.   For\r\n\ninstance,  when a  TD  notified Rivera  of  his wish  to  discuss\r\n\ntardiness,  work   habits,  and   care  of  equipment   with  the\r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\ntechnicians in his crew, Rivera called such a meeting and the  TD\r\n\nran it.  On  another occasion, a TD drafted (but did  not send) a\r\n\nmemorandum  requesting  that technical  personnel  report  to the\r\n\nstudios  at the entry time set by  management even if they had no\r\n\nassigned  work then  and  there.   Rivera  rewrote the  memo  for\r\n\nsignature  by the  TS  and the  TD, adding  a reminder  about the\r\n\npossible consequences of noncompliance.\r\n\nIII.  THE RATINGS\r          III.  THE RATINGS\r\n\n          In rating the Board's  performance, we first review its\r\n\ndetermination that the TDs are not supervisors.\r\n\n                     A.  Receiving Our Cues.\r                               A.  Receiving Our Cues.\r                                                     \r\n\n          To put this case into perspective, it bears remembering\r\n\nthat  the  Act  strives  to  limn  a  clear  distinction  between\r\n\nmanagement  and labor.   To that  end, supervisory  employees are\r\n\nexcluded from the bargaining  process because they must represent\r\n\nthe  interests  of their  employer rather  than the  interests of\r\n\ntheir coworkers.

The  Act  defines  a  \"supervisor\"  as  \"any\r\n\nindividual having authority, in the interest of the employer,  to\r\n\nhire, transfer,  suspend, lay  off,  recall, promote,  discharge,\r\n\nassign, reward, or discipline  other employees, or responsibly to\r\n\ndirect them,  or to  adjust their  grievances, or effectively  to\r\n\nrecommend  such action, if  in connection with  the foregoing the\r\n\nexercise of such authority is not of a merely routine or clerical\r\n\nnature, but requires the use of independent judgment.\"  29 U.S.C.\r\n\n  152(11).

After each  passage, sometimes at\r\n          full gallop  to keep the horses  ahead of the\r\n          load, the  straw was naturally displaced so a\r\n          man with a pitchfork was posted at each slope\r\n          to   keep   the  straw   evenly  distributed.\r\n          Although teamsters were men of consequence in\r\n          the lumber camps, the rule was that they were\r\n          not  to  start down  a  slope  until the  far\r\n          humbler functionary with  a pitchfork,  using\r\n          his \"independent judgment,\" passed  word that\r\n          the  slope  was  prepared.

After\r\n\ncarefully  examining   the  entire   record,  we  conclude   that\r\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the  Board's determination that the\r\n\nthree TDs are ordinary employees, not supervisors.\r\n\n          The linchpin of this  assessment is that, as the  Board\r\n\npointed out, the  primary responsibilities of  the TDs relate  to\r\n\nsafeguarding equipment,  ensuring that the crew  is positioned in\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\naccordance with  the script,  performing actual  production work,\r\n\nand  documenting  the  events  (or  nonevents)  incident  to  the\r\n\nproduction of  particular programs.  Although  these duties carry\r\n\nresponsibilities greater than those borne by  studio technicians,\r\n\nthey do not require  the exercise of independent judgment  in any\r\n\nlegally meaningful sense.\r\n\n          Certainly,  superintending the  maintenance and  use of\r\n\nequipment is not commonly thought to be a supervisory function or\r\n\nto require managerial authority.   See Maine Yankee, 624  F.2d at\r                                                             \r\n\n361-62.   Similarly, the mere  fact that an  employee gives other\r\n\nemployees  instructions  from time  to time  does  not in  and of\r\n\nitself render him a supervisor for purposes of the Act.  See Stop\r                                                                           \r\n\n&amp; Shop, 548 F.2d at 19.  Rather, the portent of that fact depends\r                \r\n\non the relative significance of the instructions given.  See id.;\r                                                                          \r\n\nsee also Goldies, 628 F.2d at 710.  In this situation, the TDs do\r                          \r\n\nlittle  more than  implement  the instructions  contained in  the\r\n\nprogram's  script.  Moreover, because each technician has his own\r\n\nassignment and performs repetitive tasks  day after day, the crew\r\n\nmembers require  minimal supervision.  Viewed in  the totality of\r\n\nthe  circumstances,  the TDs'  orders  are  both perfunctory  and\r\n\nroutine.   Thus, the instructions,  evaluated in context,  do not\r\n\nfairly  indicate  that  the   instructors  possess  authority  to\r\n\nexercise independent judgment in overseeing other employees.

The reports are merely informational;  the TDs\r\n\ndo not  effectively recommend  disciplinary action  by completing\r\n\nthe forms.  Thus,  even though the information conveyed  in these\r\n\nreports sometimes may lead to the imposition of discipline, it is\r\n\nnot the writers who make  the call.  Even on those  few occasions\r\n\nwhen the TDs have submitted recommendations, their superiors have\r\n\nexercised independent  judgment in  deciding whether (and  if so,\r\n\nwhat) disciplinary action is warranted.  In these respects, then,\r\n\nthe  TDs are  mere scriveners    and acting  as an  amanuensis or\r\n\notherwise  fulfilling a  purely  reportorial function  is not  an\r\n\nindicium of  supervisory status.   See Highland  Superstores, 927\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d at  922.   The evidence  as to meetings  is also  subject to\r\n\nconflicting  inferences.   To  be sure,  the  TDs attended  a few\r\n\nmeetings  for supervisors   but  many such meetings  were held to\r\n\nwhich  they were not invited.  And when they attempted to arrange\r\n\ntechnicians' meetings, they were stymied unless they received the\r\n\nblessing of Rivera and Corps.\r\n\n          We  do not mean to imply that the evidence is one-sided\r\n\nor  that the  pivotal question  is free  from doubt.   There  are\r\n\nseveral evidentiary trails in the record, some leading toward one\r\n\ndestination at which the Board arrived and some leading away from\r\n\nit.  Some of the factors which we have discussed argue in varying\r\n\ndegrees  for supervisory status    the  TDs' hegemony  at certain\r\n\ntimes,  their pay  level, the  giving of instructions  to others,\r\n\noccasionally  passing out work  assignments, filing  reports, and\r\n\nattending  meetings   but many of them are double-edged.  Just as\r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nimportant,  the Board  considered the  collective force  of these\r\n\nfactors and rejected the inference hawked by the Company in favor\r\n\nof  a different, equally supported inference.   On reflection, we\r\n\ncannot say that the Board's choice was arbitrary or capricious.\r\n\n          In a last-ditch effort to save the show, the petitioner\r\n\nflips  to another channel.   It urges that  Maine Yankee requires\r                                                                  \r\n\noverturning the  Board's decision  here.   We do not  agree.   In\r\n\nMaine Yankee, the Board  decided that shift operating supervisors\r                      \r\n\nat  a nuclear  power plant  were not  statutory supervisors.   We\r\n\nreversed.  624  F.2d at 366.  Because the shift supervisors would\r\n\nhave  to answer  for anything  that went  wrong with  the plant's\r\n\nelectrical  output, management  held  them fully  accountable and\r\n\nresponsible for  the  employees'  performance,  and,  thus,  they\r\n\npossessed authority  responsibly to direct other  employees.

Under these circumstances, we cannot fault\r\n\nthe  Board's conclusion  that the  TDs  act more  as dispatchers,\r\n\nperforming routine tasks  and conveying boilerplate instructions,\r\n\nthan as supervisors.   And, moreover,  the Board's conclusion  is\r\n\nwholly consistent with the  TDs' stated self-perception that they\r\n\nare crew leaders, no more.\r\n\n          To conclude,  there is  a fine  line between the  upper\r\n\nstrata  of  employees  and  the lowest  rungs  of  the management\r\n\nladder.   We freely acknowledge that the  Board, had it chosen to\r\n\nweight the TDs' responsibilities differently, could  have reached\r\n\nthe opposite result.

The evidence concerning the  elimination of Corps'\r                    1.\r\n\nposition as technical supervisor    the May 15 letter    requires\r\n\nscant comment.  This  letter had been submitted as  an attachment\r\n\nto the  request for  review filed  in  the wake  of the  regional\r\n\ndirector's adverse  decision  in the  representation  proceeding.\r\n\nBecause  a request for review \"may  not raise any issue or allege\r\n\nany  facts  not timely  presented to  the regional  director,\" 29\r\n\nC.F.R.    102.67(d),  the submission  of  the letter  imposed  no\r\n\nobligation on  the Board to  consider the implications  of Corps'\r\n\ntermination,  especially in the absence of a motion to reopen the\r\n\nrecord.  See generally East Mich. Care, 246 NLRB at 459 (dictum).\r                                                \r\n\n          Beyond  that pitfall,  a  second obstacle  looms.   The\r\n\nBoard, in its own  phrase, \"fully considered\" the May  15 letter.\r\n\nTelemundo, slip op. at  1 n.1.  We  think it would be curious  to\r                   \r\n\nremand  a  case  for consideration  of  evidence  that  an agency\r\n\nalready has fully considered, and we will not do so here.4\r\n\n          2.  The  more nettlesome question relates to  the claim\r                    2.\r\n\nthat the TDs had been vested with some managerial duties formerly\r\n\nhandled by  the technical supervisor and had  been assigned added\r\n\nresponsibility for evaluating other employees.  The Board's first\r\n\nnotice  of these alleged innovations came on July 16, 1996 (after\r                                                                           \r\n\nthe  bargaining  unit  had  been  certified),  when  the  Company\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4Moreover,  we  readily appreciate  the  Board's  refusal to\r\nattach decretory significance to the  epistle.  The letter states\r\nonly  that the Company had  decided to eliminate  the position of\r\ntechnical  supervisor.   It  furnishes  no  indication that  this\r\nposition elimination  might  alter or  affect  the scope  of  the\r\ntechnical directors' duties.\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nsubmitted,  as part  of its  reply to  the unfair  labor practice\r\n\ncharge, an affidavit executed  on May 9 by Elizabeth  Rivera, the\r\n\ndepartment director.  The Rivera affidavit claimed, for the first\r\n\ntime, that \"some administrative duties that were performed by the\r\n\nTechnical  Supervisor,  such  as  the preparation  of  the  daily\r\n\nschedules and  the revision and  approval of the  weekly payroll,\r\n\nare now performed  by the  Technical Directors.\"   The  affidavit\r\n\nalso  disclosed  that in  March 1996  the  Company had  created a\r\n\ncommittee  to evaluate  the technicians'  work and  made the  TDs\r\n\nmembers of it (thus enhancing their supervisory roles).\r\n\n          Assuming   arguendo   the   truth   of   the  Company's\r                                       \r\n\ndescription of these augmented duties, the timing gives us pause.\r\n\nWhile  Rivera's  affidavit is  strangely  silent as  to  when the\r\n\nchanges  transpired   its text  states only that  the TDs assumed\r\n\nthe  additional duties; it does  not broadcast the  time frame in\r\n\nwhich the Company  made the  reallocation    it is  transparently\r\n\nclear  that the attempted  expansion of the  TDs' job description\r\n\ntook place  at some  time  after the  record  had closed  in  the\r\n\nrepresentation proceeding.   Thus, those changes,  no matter when\r\n\nthereafter they were effectuated, do not constitute evidence that\r\n\ncan vitiate  the Board's determination  of the  propriety of  the\r\n\nbargaining unit.  It follows that the Board acted well within its\r\n\nlawful authority in refusing to entertain the proffer.\r\n\n          If an  employer could insist that evidence of this kind\r\n\nbe considered by  a reviewing  tribunal (be it  court or  agency)\r\n\nafter  the  administrative  record  had  been  closed,  then  the\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nemployer routinely  could defease  a bargaining unit  despite the\r\n\nfact that the Board had determined it to be appropriate.  Indeed,\r\n\ndoing  so would  require  no greater  effort  than modifying  the\r\n\naffected employees' duties.   Such a regime would be antithetical\r\n\nnot  only  to  the  Board's regulations  but  also  to precedent,\r\n\npolicy, and the objectives of the Act.\r\n\n          The regulatory scheme is explicit; the Board determines\r\n\nthe  appropriateness   of  a  bargaining  unit   based  upon  the\r\n\nconditions  of  employment  as they  exist  at  the  time of  the\r\n\nhearing,  and,   at  least   in  the  absence   of  extraordinary\r\n\ncircumstances,5 the  record thereafter  may be augmented  only by\r\n\nnewly discovered evidence.   See 29 C.F.R.   102.65(e)(1).   This\r                                          \r\n\nregulation limits  the  rubric  \"newly  discovered  evidence\"  to\r\n\n\"evidence  which has become available only since the close of the\r\n\nhearing,  or evidence  which the  regional director or  the Board\r\n\nbelieves  should have  been taken  at the  hearing.\"   Id.   This\r                                                                    \r\n\ndefinition effectively demarcates  the representation  proceeding\r\n\nas  the outermost  point in  time to  which evidence  can relate.\r\n\nFacts which arise only  after the hearing has been  concluded and\r                           \r\n\nthe record  closed are  irrelevant, whereas  facts which  are not\r\n\ndiscovered  until then  (but which  relate to  the time  frame at\r                    \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     5We reject  out  of hand  the  Company's argument  that  the\r\nchange  in  duties here  constitutes  extraordinary circumstances\r\nrequiring  the  Board to  reexamine  the  appropriateness of  the\r\nbargaining unit.  If an employer, dissatisfied with the upshot of\r\na  representation  proceeding,  could  manufacture  circumstances\r\nsufficient to  require reconsideration simply by  shifting duties\r\naround,  then  Board certifications  would  be  little more  than\r\nhollow gestures.\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nissue  in  the  hearing)  are  potentially  relevant  and  may be\r\n\nconsidered in the Board's discretion.\r\n\n          Precedent fully  supports the general  proposition that\r\n\nunilateral changes  to  employment parameters  occurring after  a\r\n\nrepresentation  hearing has  been completed  can have  no bearing\r\n\nupon the  outcome of that  proceeding.  See K-Mart,  322 NLRB No.\r                                                            \r\n\n98, slip op.  at 1 (NLRB Nov. 22,  1996) (\"If the change  was the\r\n\nresult of unilateral actions by the Respondent, it would normally\r\n\nnot be a  basis for reconsidering  the certification .  . .  .\"),\r\n\npetition for review pending (D.C.

Affording an employer  (or a  labor\r\n\nunion, for that matter)  unilateral control over critical aspects\r\n\nof the  collective bargaining process would  dislodge the balance\r\n\nand weaken the structure  of the collective bargaining framework.\r\n\nSee Auciello Iron Works,  Inc. v.

See id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\n1759; see also 29 U.S.C.   151.\r                        \r\n\n          Of   course,   the  closing   of   the   record  in   a\r\n\nrepresentation  proceeding  does not  freeze  the  duties of  the\r\n\nmembers of the proposed  bargaining unit for all time  and in all\r\n\ncircumstances.    When  the  motion  to  reopen  is  premised  on\r\n\nsubsequently  conferred  duties,   the  Board  is   warranted  in\r\n\npresuming  that such duties are irrelevant to its conclusion.  An\r\n\nemployer who  seeks to  overcome that presumption  bears a  heavy\r\n\nburden of  showing that  a legitimate business  necessity arising\r\n\nout of circumstances that were in play before the  representation\r\n\nproceeding concluded forced him to recast job descriptions.

As was repeatedly underscored in the  decision,\r\nthe  employer undertook  this reorganization as  a result  of the\r\nrecommendations  provided  by a  management consultant  which had\r\nbegun  a study  of  the employer's  operations  before the  union\r                                                                \r\ninstituted the representation proceeding.  The timing enabled the\r\nBoard to find  that the  \"restructuring was clearly  not for  the\r\npurpose of  avoiding compliance  with the Board's  unit finding.\"\r\nId.

Thus, the  evidence  contained  in\r\n\nRivera's affidavit  falls well  outside the compass  of relevance\r\n\nand cannot justify a  remand for the purpose of  relitigating the\r\n\nissue of supervisory status.\r\n\n          There is,  moreover, another basis  for sustaining  the\r\n\nBoard's  order in  the  face of  the  Company's proffer.   As  we\r\n\npreviously mentioned, the evidence  is cloudy as to  exactly when\r\n\nTelemundo first  purposed to  augment the  TDs' responsibilities.\r\n\nSee supra p.  17-18.  It is, however, pellucid  that the TDs were\r                   \r\n\nnot assigned to positions on the evaluation committee until March\r\n\n1996  at  the earliest.
