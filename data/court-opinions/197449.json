In early 1988, Vermont National and Baybank began\r\n\nnegotiating \r                       Baybank's potential participation in the loan.  In\r\n\nApril, \r                  Baybank \r                         consummated the purchase of an interest equal to\r\n\n90% \r               of \r                  the \r                      outstanding principal balance of the Liftline loan.\r\n\nThe  parties  executed   a  participation  agreement  and   a\r\n\nparticipation certificate to memorialize the arrangement.   \r\n\n          The  participation   agreement  contained   several\r\n\ninaccuracies.\r                          The agreement reflected a loan in the amount of\r\n\n$1,417,500 with an  origination date of  October 3, 1986,  to\r\n\nmature on October  3, 1996.  In fact, $1,417,500  represented\r\n\nonly \r                the \r                    amount \r                          of \r                             Baybank's participation, the loan originated\r\n\non June  5, 1986 and  was to mature  on June 5,  1988.    The\r\n\n1.  Baybank alleged breach of the participation agreement\r\n(two counts), breach of trust, breach of fiduciary duty and\r\nconversion.  Baybank also sought declaratory and injunctive\r\nrelief against Vermont National.   \r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nagreement \r                     made \r                         no \r                            mention of renewal of the loan upon maturity.\r\n\n          On June 5, 1988, six weeks after Baybank's purchase\r\n\nof the  participation  and upon  the maturity  date,  Vermont\r\n\nNational renewed the Liftline loan for a five year period  to\r\n\nmature on June 5, 1993.  Vermont National continued to  remit\r\n\nand Baybank  continued  to  accept without  comment  its  90%\r\n\ninterest in Liftline's  payments on the  loan.  By  February,\r\n\n1991, however, due to a series of poor ski seasons,  Liftline\r\n\ndefaulted on the loan and filed for bankruptcy.  \r\n\n          Upon Liftline's  default, Baybank  cooperated  with\r\n\nVermont National in trying to resolve the Liftline  situation\r\n\nfavorably. \r                       \r                      Baybank \r                              neither demanded payment in full of its 90%\r\n\nshare of the  loan nor asserted that  it had never agreed  to\r\n\nparticipate in the 1988 renewal.  It was not until 1993  that\r\n\nBaybank \r                   first alleged that it never intended to participate in\r\n\nthe renewal and filed this complaint.\r\n\n          In \r                        its \r                           complaint, \r                                      Baybank sought damages arising from\r\n\nVermont  National's  alleged  breach  of  the   participation\r\n\nagreement.  Baybank claimed that the participation  agreement\r\n\ndid \r               not \r                   extend to the renewal and, therefore, Vermont National\r\n\nowed Baybank its 90% share of the loan at maturity on June 5,\r\n\n1988. \r                  \r                  Baybank \r                         based \r                               its \r                                   claims for conversion, breach of trust\r\n\nand  breach  of  fiduciary  duty  on  this  same  allegation.\r\n\nAlternatively,  Baybank   contended   that,   even   if   the\r\n\nparticipation agreement  extended  to  the  renewal,  Vermont\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nNational breached the agreement by failing to provide Baybank\r\n\nwith \r                items \r                      of financial information as the agreement required.\r\n\nThe \r               district \r                        court granted summary judgment against Baybank on\r\n\nall counts.  This appeal followed.  \r\n\n                     Standard of Review\r\n\n          We \r                        review \r                               the \r                                  award \r                                        of \r                                           summary judgment de novo.  See\r\n\nOrtiz-Pinero v. Rivera-Arroyo, 84 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\nSummary judgment is  appropriate in the absence of a  genuine\r\n\nissue of material fact, when the moving party is entitled  to\r\n\njudgment as  a matter of law.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).   A\r\n\nfact is  material when  it has  the potential  to affect  the\r\n\noutcome \r                   of \r                      the suit.  See  J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan\r\n\nv. Smith Barney  Shearson, Inc., 76  F.3d 1245, 1250-51  (1st\r\n\nCir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 81 (1996).  Neither party may\r\n\nrely \r                on \r                   conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated denials, but\r\n\nmust  identify specific  facts  derived from  the  pleadings,\r\n\ndepositions,  answers  to  interrogatories,  admissions   and\r\n\naffidavits \r                      to \r                        demonstrate either the existence or absence of an\r\n\nissue of fact.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c) &amp; (e). \r\n\n                         Discussion\r\n\n          The central issue this  case raises is whether  the\r\n\nparticipation \r                         agreement \r                                  contemplated Baybank's participation in\r\n\nthe renewal.  Finding  the agreement ambiguous, the  district\r\n\ncourt \r                 admitted extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent as an\r\n\naid \r               in \r                  its \r                      construction of the agreement.  The court concluded\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nthat Baybank  had agreed to participate  in the renewal.   On\r\n\n    al Baybank contends that the contract was not  ambiguous,\r\n\nand that even if it was, the evidence at a minimum  precluded\r\n\nsummary judgment on its claims.  We examine each of Baybank's\r\n\narguments in turn.  \r\n\nA.  Was the Participation Agreement Ambiguous?\r\n\n          T\r            appe       he \r                         parties \r                                 agree that pursuant to the participation\r\n\nagreement, \r                      Vermont law governs this dispute.  See Miniter Ins.\r\n\nAgency, Inc. v. Ohio Indemnity Co., 112 F.3d 1240, 1245  (1st\r\n\nCir. \r                1997) \r                      (indicating that where parties agree as to what law\r\n\ngoverns, federal court sitting in diversity is free to forego\r\n\nan \r              independent \r                         analysis \r                                  and may accept the parties' agreement).\r\n\nThe  parties also  agree  that  the  participation  agreement\r\n\nmisidentified  several   terms  of   the  actual   agreement,\r\n\nspecifically, the amount of the loan and the origination  and\r\n\nmaturity dates.  Baybank characterizes these as  \"scrivener's\r\n\nerrors\" and contends that under Vermont law the participation\r\n\nagreement reflects no substantive ambiguity.\r\n\n          In Vermont,  whether a contract  is ambiguous is  a\r\n\nquestion of law.2   See Breslauer v. Fayston Sch. Dist.,  659\r\n\n2.  The parties agree that we should construe the\r\nparticipation agreement under general contract principles. \r\nSee, e.g., Den Norske Bank v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 75\r\nF.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying general contract\r\nprinciples under Massachusetts law to analyze disputed\r\nparticipation agreement).  Neither our research nor that of\r\nthe parties has uncovered any Vermont authority suggesting a\r\nmore appropriate analytical approach.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nA.2d \r                1129, \r                      1135 (Vt. 1995); Isbrandtsen v. North Branch Corp.,\r\n\n556 A.2d 81, 83 (Vt.  1988).  Vermont law, however, does  not\r\n\nrestrict courts making that inquiry to the four corners of  a\r\n\nwritten agreement.   Instead, courts  may consider  extrinsic\r\n\nevidence of \"the circumstances surrounding the making of  the\r\n\nagreement as well as the object, nature and subject matter of\r\n\nthe \r               writing,\"  Breslauer, 659 A.2d at 1135 (internal quotation\r\n\nomitted), and will find ambiguity in the event that a writing\r\n\nin itself supports a different interpretation than that which\r\n\nappears when read in light of the surrounding  circumstances,\r\n\nSee Isbrandtsen,  556  A.2d  at 84.    Both  interpretations,\r\n\nhowever, must be reasonable in order to establish  ambiguity.\r\n\nSee id.  \r\n\n          On  its  face  the  participation  agreement  seems\r\n\nunambiguous. \r                         The parties, however, agree that the amounts and\r\n\ndates  in   the  agreement  do   not  reflect  their   actual\r\n\nunderstanding\r                        , and each party directs us to extrinsic evidence\r\n\nsuggesting \r                      competing \r                               interpretations of the agreement.  That we\r\n\nmust resort to extrinsic evidence to determine the intent  of\r\n\nthe parties renders the contract necessarily ambiguous.3\r\n\n3.  Without regard to the legal strategy of either party, we\r\nnote that neither of the litigants sought rescission and\r\nreformation on the basis of mistake.  In Vermont,\r\n\"[r]eformation is appropriate when an agreement has been\r\nmade, or a transaction has been entered into or determined\r\nupon, . . . , but in reducing such agreement or transaction\r\nin writing, the written instrument fails to express the real\r\nagreement or transaction.\"  LaRock v. Hill, 310 A.2d 124, 126\r\n(Vt. 1973) (internal citations and quotations omitted). \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\n          Baybank argues unpersuasively that consideration of\r\n\nthe  participation  certificate   in  conjunction  with   the\r\n\nparticipation agreement  renders  the latter  unambiguous  in\r\n\nBaybank's  favor.    We  recognize  that  the   participation\r\n\ncertificate, executed on the  same date as the  participation\r\n\nagreement,  correctly   states   the  amount   of   Baybank's\r\n\nparticipation and explicitly refers to the June 5, 1986  note\r\n\nwhich had a maturity date of June 5, 1988.  The participation\r\n\ncertificate, however,  neither references  the  participation\r\n\nagreement  nor explicitly  sets any  parameters on  Baybank's\r\n\nparticipation.   The certificate,  in other  words, does  not\r\n\ndefinitively resolve the agreement's ambiguity.    \r\n\n          Even if we assume  that consideration of these  two\r\n\ndocuments \r                     together results in one reasonable interpretation of\r\n\nthe participation agreement, a host of extrinsic evidence  in\r\n\nthe  record supports  an alternative  but equally  reasonable\r\n\ninterpretation.   Much  of this  evidence also  bears on  the\r\n\nsubstance \r                     of \r                        Baybank's breach of contract claim and we discuss\r\n\nit fully in our  analysis of that claim.   We note only  that\r\n\nVermont  law  directs   us  to  consider  the   circumstances\r\n\nReformation of this agreement would require a consideration\r\nof any extrinsic evidence of the terms of the actual\r\nagreement which the writing in question failed to record. \r\nSee Paradise Restaurant, Inc. v. Somerset Enters., Inc., 671\r\nA.2d 1258, 1262 (Vt. 1995).  Whether through reformation or\r\nthrough a finding of ambiguity, therefore, we would need to\r\nconstrue the agreement through relevant extrinsic evidence. \r\nAs the parties have chosen the route of ambiguity, we let\r\nthat doctrine frame our analysis.  \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nsurrounding the agreement; it does not direct us to select  a\r\n\nsingle circumstance  which if  considered in  a vacuum  might\r\n\nresolve the  ambiguity.   See  Breslauer,  659 A.2d  at  1135\r\n\n(directing courts to  consider evidence on the  circumstances\r\n\nsurrounding \r                       the making of the agreement as well as the object,\r\n\nnature and subject matter of the agreement itself).  \r\n\nB.  Does the Participation Agreement Contemplate the Renewal?\r\n\n          Courts faced with ambiguity in a contract resort to\r\n\n\"subordinate \r                        rules of construction,\" see Isbrandtsen, 556 A.2d\r\n\nat  85, including  consideration of  extrinsic evidence,  see\r\n\nAbbiati\r                   \r                   v. \r                      Bu\r                        ttura &amp; Sons, Inc., 639 A.2d 988, 991 (Vt. 1994),\r\n\nto determine the  proper construction of  the contract.   The\r\n\nproper construction is that which reflects or effectuates the\r\n\nintent of the parties.  See Abbiati, 639 A.2d at 991.  In any\r\n\ngiven case  relevance guides the  use of extrinsic  evidence.\r\n\nSome of the same evidence that may bear on whether a  written\r\n\ncontract is  ambiguous  may also  cast  light on  the  proper\r\n\ninterpretation of the language  upon a finding of  ambiguity.\r\n\nSee, e.g.,  id. at 991  (indicating that circumstances  under\r\n\nwhich \r                 the \r                     contract arose are relevant in determining intent of\r\n\nparties).    \r\n\n          Generally,  the construction  of  a contract  is  a\r\n\nquestion of law.

We  conclude that the  record in this  case\r\n\nallows  for no such  dispute.  Instead  it reflects that  the\r\n\nparties intended the participation agreement to extend to the\r\n\nrenewal, and,  therefore,  the district  court  appropriately\r\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of Vermont National.\r\n\n          From Baybank's  negotiations with Vermont  National\r\n\nprior \r                 to \r                    June 5, 1988, the date that Baybank now claims marked\r\n\nthe end of its participation period, until September of 1993,\r\n\nwhen \r                Baybank \r                        filed \r                             its \r                                 complaint, Baybank repeatedly reaffirmed\r\n\nits  understanding that  its  participation extended  to  the\r\n\nrenewal.  George Todd  Marchant, Vice President in  Baybank's\r\n\ncommercial  loan department  and  member  of  Baybank's  loan\r\n\ncommittee, \r                      negotiated the initial participation agreement with\r\n\nLouis Dunham, Executive Vice President of Vermont  National.4\r\n\nMarchant \r                    testified \r                             that \r                                  he and Dunham discussed the anticipated\r\n\nrenewal \r                   of \r                      the \r                         Liftline \r                                  loan scheduled to occur six weeks after\r\n\nBaybank  purchased  its  participation,  and  that  the  loan\r\n\ncommittee's approval of  participation in  the Liftline  loan\r\n\n4.  The loan committee at Baybank had final authority to\r\napprove loans in which Baybank sought to participate.\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nincluded  participation in  the renewal.5   Marchant  further\r\n\ntestified that a handwritten note in the top corner of one of\r\n\nthe \r               loan \r                    documents produced from Baybank's file read \"per Lou,\r\n\nthis note will be renewed on the same terms.\"6  \r\n\n          From September 1991  to spring 1993, David  Hobert,\r\n\nthen  an  account  officer   with  Baybank,  served  as   the\r\n\nparticipating agent in  the loan.   In this capacity,  Hobert\r\n\noversaw the relationship between Baybank and Vermont National\r\n\npertinent to the  Liftline loan and worked with officials  at\r\n\nVermont National \"in administering the direction of the  loan\r\n\nand  foreclosure.\" Hobert  testified  that  when  he  assumed\r\n\noversight \r                     of \r                        the \r                           loan, \r                                 nearly two years after the maturity date\r\n\nto \r              which \r                    Baybank now clings, \"it was understood that [Baybank]\r\n\nhad a 90% participation.\"\r\n\n          On behalf of  Baybank, Hobert  worked closely  with\r\n\nVermont \r                   National as the two banks considered their options and\r\n\nplanned \r                   their \r                        workout \r                                strategies.7  Hobert visited the Liftline\r\n\n5.  Marchant testified that he recalled a three year renewal\r\nrather than the five year renewal Vermont National asserts. \r\nTo the extent that fact is in dispute, it is not material to\r\nBaybank's claim; Baybank does not dispute the length of time\r\nof any renewal to which it agreed.  Instead, Baybank argues,\r\nit never agreed to any renewal at all.  \r\n\n6.  The testimony of Louis Dunham, Executive Vice President\r\nof Vermont National, corroborates Marchant's understanding of\r\nthe scope of the participation.  \r\n\n7.  Interestingly, rather than immediately file the present\r\ncomplaint against Vermont National, shortly after default\r\nBaybank filed suit in state court in Massachusetts against\r\nguarantors of the loan.\r\n\n                            -10-\r                                         10\r\r\n\nlodge  in 1992,  nearly four  years after  the maturity  date\r\n\nBaybank claims, to examine the collateral and participate  in\r\n\nnegotiations with  the  lodge owners  on clearing  the  debt.\r\n\nHobert \r                  testified that he made this trip because Baybank \"was a\r\n\n90% \r               participant \r                           in \r                             the \r                                 loan,\" and he was invited to inspect the\r\n\nproperty \r                    with \r                         the \r                            lead \r                                 bank.  On behalf of Baybank, Hobert also\r\n\nproposed a settlement with Liftline's guarantors and proposed\r\n\nthat Baybank and Vermont National form a corporation of which\r\n\nBaybank would own 90% and Vermont National would own 10%, for\r\n\nthe \r               purpose \r                       of \r                         taking \r                                title to the property and other assets of\r\n\nLiftline.      \r\n\n          Documentary \r                                 evidence from Baybank's files throughout\r\n\nthe life  of the  loan further  undermines Baybank's  renewal\r\n\nclaim. \r                   \r                   In \r                     October \r                             1988 \r                                  and again in 1989, Baybank sent Vermont\r\n\nNational  \"audit  confirmation\"  notices  requesting  Vermont\r\n\nNational \r                    to \r                       submit information regarding Baybank's interest in\r\n\nthe Liftline loan.  Both of the notices reflect a due date or\r\n\nmaturity date  of June 5,  1993, which  corresponds with  the\r\n\nmaturity date  of the renewed loan.   Watch List Reports,  in\r\n\nwhich Baybank  lists  \"troubled\" loans  requiring  additional\r\n\nmonitoring, \r                       listed \r                             the \r                                 Liftline loan and specifically indicated\r\n\nan origination date of April 25, 1988 and a maturity date  of\r\n\nJune 5, 1993.\r\n\n          As indicated,  the question  of the  intent of  the\r\n\nparties \r                   to \r                      an ambiguous agreement is one of fact.  See Housing\r\n\n                            -11-\r                                         11\r\r\n\nVt., 685 A.2d at  1088.  In this  case Baybank has failed  t\r\n\n          any  evidence  that  would  place  its  intent   t\r\n\n            n the renewal in dispute.  Instead, the record in\r                                                                        o\r            identify                                                    o\r            participate \r                       i\r\n\nthis \r                case \r                     establishes beyond question that Baybank intended to\r\n\nand  did participate  in the  renewal of  the Liftline  loan.\r\n\nAccordingly, the  district  court correctly  granted  summary\r\n\njudgment     in    favor    of    Vermont     National.8     \r\n\nC.  Did  Vermont  National  Commit  Other  Breaches  of   the\r\n               Participation Agreement?  \r\n\n          Baybank contends  that  even if  the  participation\r\n\nagreement \r                     did extend to the renewal, Vermont National breached\r\n\nthe \r               agreement \r                         by \r                           failing \r                                   to provide it with certain information\r\n\nthe agreement  required.   Baybank also  claims that  Vermont\r\n\nNational \r                    settled \r                            a \r                             claim \r                                   against the individual guarantors over\r\n\n8.  Our conclusion that Baybank intended to participate in\r\nthe renewal also forecloses Baybank's claims for conversion,\r\nbreach of trust, and breach of fiduciary duty, all of which\r\nBaybank premises on its argument that the participation\r\nagreement required Vermont National to remit Baybank's 90%\r\nparticipation on June 5, 1988 rather than roll the funds into\r\nthe renewal.  With respect to conversion and breach of trust,\r\nBaybank fails to establish that Vermont National did anything\r\nimpermissible with Baybank's participation interest.  If we\r\naccept Baybank's assertion that Vermont National had a\r\nfiduciary duty to Baybank at least with respect to paying\r\nBaybank its share of the Liftline loan proceeds, Baybank\r\nfails to establish any conduct by Vermont National that\r\nconstitutes a breach of that duty.  Vermont National\r\ncontinued paying Baybank its participation share of the\r\nmonthly payments until the default, and Baybank continued to\r\naccept those payments.  After the bankruptcy court provided\r\nVermont National with adequate protection payments on the\r\nLiftline loan, Vermont National forwarded Baybank 90% of each\r\nmonthly payment.    \r\n\n                            -12-\r                                         12\r\r\n\nBaybank's objection  in  contravention of  the  participation\r\n\nagreement.9  We find neither of these arguments persuasive.  \r\n\n          The participation agreement provides: \r\n\n               As long  as  the  Participating\r\n               Bank  continues   to  have   an\r\n               ownership interest in the Loan,\r\n               the Originating Bank agrees  to\r\n               regularly      provide      the\r\n               Participating\r                                        Bank with complete\r\n               and current credit related  and\r\n               other \r                                information concerning the\r\n               Borrower,  the  Loan  and   the\r\n               collateral \r                                     securing the Loan . .\r\n               . .\r\n\nBaybank points  us to  the deposition  testimony of  Kathleen\r\n\nMullin \r                  and \r                      David \r                           Hobert, \r                                   Baybank employees who oversaw the loan\r\n\nat different points during its existence.  The district court\r\n\nreviewed \r                    both of these sources and determined that they failed\r\n\nto  establish even a  dispute of fact  as to whether  Vermont\r\n\nNational breached the participation in this way.  \r\n\n          We \r                        need \r                             not \r                                 revisit this evidence in detail.  Mullin\r\n\ntestified \r                     that \r                          she \r                             could \r                                   not remember specifically what Vermont\r\n\nNational had failed  to provide and what  she had or had  not\r\n\nreceived. \r                      \r                      Hobert professed no knowledge as to why Baybank had\r\n\n9.  Baybank insists that it adduced \"strong evidence\" that\r\nVermont National and Liftline did not actually execute the\r\noriginal loan on June 5, 1986, but rather backdated the note\r\nto reflect that date.  According to Baybank, but for the\r\nbackdating, the note was actually in default, and the\r\nparticipation agreement required Vermont National to inform\r\nBaybank of any default.  Baybank's brief, one-paragraph\r\ndiscussion of this argument offers us no compelling reason to\r\nrepeat the district court's thorough analysis or to disturb\r\nthe court's legal conclusions.  \r\n\n                            -13-\r                                         13\r\r\n\nnot received certain documents, specifically, whether it  was\r\n\ndue \r               to \r                 Vermont \r                         National's delinquency or that of the debtors or\r\n\nguarantors.   Mullin and  Hobert simply  could not  recollect\r\n\nexactly  what information Baybank had in its possession, what\r\n\ninformation  Baybank  sought  and  what  information  Vermont\r\n\nNational failed  to produce.   In  short, we  agree with  the\r\n\ndistrict \r                    court that their testimony fails to raise any genuine\r\n\nissue of material fact on this claim.  \r\n\n          Finally,  Baybank  argues  that  Vermont   National\r\n\nbreached  the participation  agreement  by settling  a  claim\r\n\nagainst the individual guarantors of the Liftline loan.   The\r\n\nparticipation  agreement  prohibited  Vermont  National  from\r\n\n\"waiv[ing] \r                      or \r                        releas[ing] any claim against any Borrower and/or\r\n\nagainst any co-maker, guarantor or endorser under the  Loan.\"\r\n\nBaybank directs us to the affidavit of Richard Butler, Senior\r\n\nVice President of Baybank,  who claims that Vermont  National\r\n\nsettled against the guarantors in contravention of  Baybank's\r\n\ninstructions.       This    conclusory    assertion    simply\r\n\nmischaracterizes the record.\r\n\n          The record  reveals that  on April  15, 1993,  Mark\r\n\nLaPointe  of  Vermont National  and  David  Hobert  met  with\r\n\nattorneys for the guarantors.  Hobert, not LaPointe, proposed\r\n\na  settlement but  failed  to  reach an  agreement  with  the\r\n\nguarantors. \r                        \r                       A \r                         memorandum dated April 20, 1993, the veracity of\r\n\nwhich \r                 Baybank \r                         does \r                             not \r                                 dispute, memorializes this meeting.  The\r\n\n                            -14-\r                                         14\r\r\n\nguarantors then  moved to enforce  a settlement agreement  in\r\n\nbankruptcy \r                      court despite the fact that none of the parties had\r\n\nagreed to final  terms of settlement.   Vermont National  and\r\n\nBaybank both  opposed  the  motion.   The  bankruptcy  court,\r\n\nhowever, granted the  motion, effectively forcing  settlement\r\n\nupon \r                the \r                    banks.  Butler's conclusory allegations fail to raise\r\n\na genuine issue of material fact. \r\n\n                         Conclusion\r\n\n          Having \r                            found \r                                  no error, we conclude that the district\r\n\ncourt  appropriately granted  summary  judgment in  favor  of\r\n\nVermont National on all counts.\r\n\n          Affirmed.

In early 1988, Vermont National and Baybank began negotiating Baybank's potential participation in the loan.  In April, Baybank consummated the purchase of an interest equal to 90% of the outstanding principal balance of the Liftline loan.  The parties executed a participation agreement and a participation certificate to memorialize the arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The participation agreement contained several inaccuracies.  The agreement reflected a loan in the amount of $1,417,500 with an origination date of October 3, 1986, to mature on October 3, 1996.  In fact, $1,417,500 represented only the amount of Baybank's participation, the loan originated on June 5, 1986 and was to mature on June 5, 1988.  The agreement made no mention of renewal of the loan upon maturity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 1988, six weeks after Baybank's purchase of the participation and upon the maturity date, Vermont National renewed the Liftline loan for a five year period to mature on June 5, 1993.  Vermont National continued to remit and Baybank continued to accept without comment its 90% interest in Liftline's payments on the loan.  By February, 1991, however, due to a series of poor ski seasons, Liftline defaulted on the loan and filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon Liftline's default, Baybank cooperated with Vermont National in trying to resolve the Liftline situation favorably.  Baybank neither demanded payment in full of its 90% share of the loan nor asserted that it had never agreed to participate in the 1988 renewal.  It was not until 1993 that Baybank first alleged that it never intended to participate in the renewal and filed this complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its complaint, Baybank sought damages arising from Vermont National's alleged breach of the participation agreement.  Baybank claimed that the participation agreement did not extend to the renewal and, therefore, Vermont National owed Baybank its 90% share of the loan at maturity on June 5, 1988.  Baybank based its claims for conversion, breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty on this same allegation.  Alternatively, Baybank contended that, even if the participation agreement extended to the renewal, Vermont National breached the agreement by failing to provide Baybank with items of financial information as the agreement required.  The district court granted summary judgment against Baybank on all counts.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the award of summary judgment de novo.  See Ortiz-Pinero v. Rivera-Arroyo, 84 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir.1996).  Summary judgment is appropriate in the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).  A fact is material when it has the potential to affect the outcome of the suit.  See J. Geils Band Employee Benefit Plan v. Smith Barney Shearson, Inc., 76 F.3d 1245, 1250-51 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 81, 136 L.Ed.2d 39 (1996).  Neither party may rely on conclusory allegations or unsubstantiated denials, but must identify specific facts derived from the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits to demonstrate either the existence or absence of an issue of fact.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c) &amp; (e).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The central issue this case raises is whether the participation agreement contemplated Baybank's participation in the renewal.  Finding the agreement ambiguous, the district court admitted extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent as an aid in its construction of the agreement.  The court concluded that Baybank had agreed to participate in the renewal.  On appeal Baybank contends that the contract was not ambiguous, and that even if it was, the evidence at a minimum precluded summary judgment on its claims.  We examine each of Baybank's arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>A. Was the Participation Agreement Ambiguous?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that pursuant to the participation agreement, Vermont law governs this dispute.  See Miniter Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Ohio Indemnity Co., 112 F.3d 1240, 1245 (1st Cir.1997) (indicating that where parties agree as to what law governs, federal court sitting in diversity is free to forego an independent analysis and may accept the parties' agreement).  The parties also agree that the participation agreement misidentified several terms of the actual agreement, specifically, the amount of the loan and the origination and maturity dates.  Baybank characterizes these as \"scrivener's errors\" and contends that under Vermont law the participation agreement reflects no substantive ambiguity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Vermont, whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See Breslauer v. Fayston Sch. Dist., 163 Vt. 416, 659 A.2d 1129, 1135 (1995);  Isbrandtsen v. North Branch Corp., 150 Vt. 575, 556 A.2d 81, 83 (1988).  Vermont law, however, does not restrict courts making that inquiry to the four corners of a written agreement.  Instead, courts may consider extrinsic evidence of \"the circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement as well as the object, nature and subject matter of the writing,\" Breslauer, 659 A.2d at 1135 (internal quotation omitted), and will find ambiguity in the event that a writing in itself supports a different interpretation than that which appears when read in light of the surrounding circumstances, See Isbrandtsen, 556 A.2d at 84.   Both interpretations, however, must be reasonable in order to establish ambiguity.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On its face the participation agreement seems unambiguous.  The parties, however, agree that the amounts and dates in the agreement do not reflect their actual understanding, and each party directs us to extrinsic evidence suggesting competing interpretations of the agreement.  That we must resort to extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties renders the contract necessarily ambiguous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baybank argues unpersuasively that consideration of the participation certificate in conjunction with the participation agreement renders the latter unambiguous in Baybank's favor.  We recognize that the participation certificate, executed on the same date as the participation agreement, correctly states the amount of Baybank's participation and explicitly refers to the June 5, 1986 note which had a maturity date of June 5, 1988.  The participation certificate, however, neither references the participation agreement nor explicitly sets any parameters on Baybank's participation.  The certificate, in other words, does not definitively resolve the agreement's ambiguity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that consideration of these two documents together results in one reasonable interpretation of the participation agreement, a host of extrinsic evidence in the record supports an alternative but equally reasonable interpretation.  Much of this evidence also bears on the substance of Baybank's breach of contract claim and we discuss it fully in our analysis of that claim.  We note only that Vermont law directs us to consider the circumstances surrounding the agreement;  it does not direct us to select a single circumstance which if considered in a vacuum might resolve the ambiguity.  See Breslauer, 659 A.2d at 1135 (directing courts to consider evidence on the circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement as well as the object, nature and subject matter of the agreement itself).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>B. Does the Participation Agreement Contemplate the Renewal?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts faced with ambiguity in a contract resort to \"subordinate rules of construction,\" see Isbrandtsen, 556 A.2d at 85, including consideration of extrinsic evidence, see Abbiati v. Buttura &amp; Sons, Inc., 161 Vt. 314, 639 A.2d 988, 991 (1994), to determine the proper construction of the contract.  The proper construction is that which reflects or effectuates the intent of the parties.  See Abbiati, 639 A.2d at 991.   In any given case relevance guides the use of extrinsic evidence.  Some of the same evidence that may bear on whether a written contract is ambiguous may also cast light on the proper interpretation of the language upon a finding of ambiguity.  See, e.g., id. at 991 (indicating that circumstances under which the contract arose are relevant in determining intent of parties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, the construction of a contract is a question of law.  See Morrisseau v. Fayette, 164 Vt. 358, 670 A.2d 820, 826 (1995).  \"[W]here the meaning of a contract is uncertain,\" however, \"the intent of the parties becomes a question of fact.\"  Housing Vt. v. Goldsmith &amp; Morris, 685 A.2d 1086, 1088 (Vt.1996).  In this case, therefore, we must determine whether the record contains sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Baybank did not intend to participate in the renewal.  We conclude that the record in this case allows for no such dispute.  Instead it reflects that the parties intended the participation agreement to extend to the renewal, and, therefore, the district court appropriately granted summary judgment in favor of Vermont National.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From Baybank's negotiations with Vermont National prior to June 5, 1988, the date that Baybank now claims marked the end of its participation period, until September of 1993, when Baybank filed its complaint, Baybank repeatedly reaffirmed its understanding that its participation extended to the renewal.  George Todd Marchant, Vice President in Baybank's commercial loan department and member of Baybank's loan committee, negotiated the initial participation agreement with Louis Dunham, Executive Vice President of Vermont National.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Marchant testified that he and Dunham discussed the anticipated renewal of the Liftline loan scheduled to occur six weeks after Baybank purchased its participation, and that the loan committee's approval of participation in the Liftline loan included participation in the renewal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Marchant further testified that a handwritten note in the top corner of one of the loan documents produced from Baybank's file read \"per Lou, this note will be renewed on the same terms.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From September 1991 to spring 1993, David Hobert, then an account officer with Baybank, served as the participating agent in the loan.  In this capacity, Hobert oversaw the relationship between Baybank and Vermont National pertinent to the Liftline loan and worked with officials at Vermont National \"in administering the direction of the loan and foreclosure.\"   Hobert testified that when he assumed oversight of the loan, nearly two years after the maturity date to which Baybank now clings, \"it was understood that [Baybank] had a 90% participation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On behalf of Baybank, Hobert worked closely with Vermont National as the two banks considered their options and planned their workout strategies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Hobert visited the Liftline lodge in 1992, nearly four years after the maturity date Baybank claims, to examine the collateral and participate in negotiations with the lodge owners on clearing the debt.  Hobert testified that he made this trip because Baybank \"was a 90% participant in the loan,\" and he was invited to inspect the property with the lead bank.  On behalf of Baybank, Hobert also proposed a settlement with Liftline's guarantors and proposed that Baybank and Vermont National form a corporation of which Baybank would own 90% and Vermont National would own 10%, for the purpose of taking title to the property and other assets of Liftline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Documentary evidence from Baybank's files throughout the life of the loan further undermines Baybank's renewal claim.  In October 1988 and again in 1989, Baybank sent Vermont National \"audit confirmation\" notices requesting Vermont National to submit information regarding Baybank's interest in the Liftline loan.  Both of the notices reflect a due date or maturity date of June 5, 1993, which corresponds with the maturity date of the renewed loan.  Watch List Reports, in which Baybank lists \"troubled\" loans requiring additional monitoring, listed the Liftline loan and specifically indicated an origination date of April 25, 1988 and a maturity date of June 5, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated, the question of the intent of the parties to an ambiguous agreement is one of fact.  See Housing Vt., 685 A.2d at 1088.   In this case Baybank has failed to identify any evidence that would place its intent to participate in the renewal in dispute.  Instead, the record in this case establishes beyond question that Baybank intended to and did participate in the renewal of the Liftline loan.  Accordingly, the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Vermont National.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>C. Did Vermont National Commit Other Breaches of the Participation Agreement?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baybank contends that even if the participation agreement did extend to the renewal, Vermont National breached the agreement by failing to provide it with certain information the agreement required.  Baybank also claims that Vermont National settled a claim against the individual guarantors over Baybank's objection in contravention of the participation agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  We find neither of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The participation agreement provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>As long as the Participating Bank continues to have an ownership interest in the Loan, the Originating Bank agrees to regularly provide the Participating Bank with complete and current credit related and other information concerning the Borrower, the Loan and the collateral securing the Loan....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baybank points us to the deposition testimony of Kathleen Mullin and David Hobert, Baybank employees who oversaw the loan at different points during its existence.  The district court reviewed both of these sources and determined that they failed to establish even a dispute of fact as to whether Vermont National breached the participation in this way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not revisit this evidence in detail.  Mullin testified that she could not remember specifically what Vermont National had failed to provide and what she had or had not received.  Hobert professed no knowledge as to why Baybank had not received certain documents, specifically, whether it was due to Vermont National's delinquency or that of the debtors or guarantors.  Mullin and Hobert simply could not recollect exactly what information Baybank had in its possession, what information Baybank sought and what information Vermont National failed to produce.  In short, we agree with the district court that their testimony fails to raise any genuine issue of material fact on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Baybank argues that Vermont National breached the participation agreement by settling a claim against the individual guarantors of the Liftline loan.  The participation agreement prohibited Vermont National from \"waiv[ing] or releas[ing] any claim against any Borrower and/or against any co-maker, guarantor or endorser under the Loan.\"  Baybank directs us to the affidavit of Richard Butler, Senior Vice President of Baybank, who claims that Vermont National settled against the guarantors in contravention of Baybank's instructions.  This conclusory assertion simply mischaracterizes the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals that on April 15, 1993, Mark LaPointe of Vermont National and David Hobert met with attorneys for the guarantors.  Hobert, not LaPointe, proposed a settlement but failed to reach an agreement with the guarantors.  A memorandum dated April 20, 1993, the veracity of which Baybank does not dispute, memorializes this meeting.  The guarantors then moved to enforce a settlement agreement in bankruptcy court despite the fact that none of the parties had agreed to final terms of settlement.  Vermont National and Baybank both opposed the motion.  The bankruptcy court, however, granted the motion, effectively forcing settlement upon the banks.  Butler's conclusory allegations fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found no error, we conclude that the district court appropriately granted summary judgment in favor of Vermont National on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Baybank also sought declaratory and injunctive relief against Vermont National</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The parties agree that we should construe the participation agreement under general contract principles.  See, e.g., Den Norske Bank v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 75 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir.1996) (applying general contract principles under Massachusetts law to analyze disputed participation agreement).  Neither our research nor that of the parties has uncovered any Vermont authority suggesting a more appropriate analytical approach</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Without regard to the legal strategy of either party, we note that neither of the litigants sought rescission and reformation on the basis of mistake.  In Vermont, \"[r]eformation is appropriate when an agreement has been made, or a transaction has been entered into or determined upon, ..., but in reducing such agreement or transaction in writing, the written instrument fails to express the real agreement or transaction.\"  LaRock v. Hill, 131 Vt. 528, 310 A.2d 124, 126 (1973) (internal citations and quotations omitted).  Reformation of this agreement would require a consideration of any extrinsic evidence of the terms of the actual agreement which the writing in question failed to record.  See Paradise Restaurant, Inc. v. Somerset Enters., Inc., 164 Vt. 405, 671 A.2d 1258, 1262 (1995).  Whether through reformation or through a finding of ambiguity, therefore, we would need to construe the agreement through relevant extrinsic evidence.  As the parties have chosen the route of ambiguity, we let that doctrine frame our analysis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The loan committee at Baybank had final authority to approve loans in which Baybank sought to participate</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Marchant testified that he recalled a three year renewal rather than the five year renewal Vermont National asserts.  To the extent that fact is in dispute, it is not material to Baybank's claim;  Baybank does not dispute the length of time of any renewal to which it agreed.  Instead, Baybank argues, it never agreed to any renewal at all</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The testimony of Louis Dunham, Executive Vice President of Vermont National, corroborates Marchant's understanding of the scope of the participation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Interestingly, rather than immediately file the present complaint against Vermont National, shortly after default Baybank filed suit in state court in Massachusetts against guarantors of the loan</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Our conclusion that Baybank intended to participate in the renewal also forecloses Baybank's claims for conversion, breach of trust, and breach of fiduciary duty, all of which Baybank premises on its argument that the participation agreement required Vermont National to remit Baybank's 90% participation on June 5, 1988 rather than roll the funds into the renewal.  With respect to conversion and breach of trust, Baybank fails to establish that Vermont National did anything impermissible with Baybank's participation interest.  If we accept Baybank's assertion that Vermont National had a fiduciary duty to Baybank at least with respect to paying Baybank its share of the Liftline loan proceeds, Baybank fails to establish any conduct by Vermont National that constitutes a breach of that duty.  Vermont National continued paying Baybank its participation share of the monthly payments until the default, and Baybank continued to accept those payments.  After the bankruptcy court provided Vermont National with adequate protection payments on the Liftline loan, Vermont National forwarded Baybank 90% of each monthly payment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Baybank insists that it adduced \"strong evidence\" that Vermont National and Liftline did not actually execute the original loan on June 5, 1986, but rather backdated the note to reflect that date.  According to Baybank, but for the backdating, the note was actually in default, and the participation agreement required Vermont National to inform Baybank of any default.  Baybank's brief, one-paragraph discussion of this argument offers us no compelling reason to repeat the district court's thorough analysis or to disturb the court's legal conclusions</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In early 1988, Vermont National and Baybank began negotiating Baybank's potential participation in the loan.  In April, Baybank consummated the purchase of an interest equal to 90% of the outstanding principal balance of the Liftline loan.  The parties executed a participation agreement and a participation certificate to memorialize the arrangement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The participation agreement contained several inaccuracies.  The agreement reflected a loan in the amount of $1,417,500 with an origination date of October 3, 1986, to mature on October 3, 1996.  In fact, $1,417,500 represented only the amount of Baybank's participation, the loan originated on June 5, 1986 and was to mature on June 5, 1988.  The agreement made no mention of renewal of the loan upon maturity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 5, 1988, six weeks after Baybank's purchase of the participation and upon the maturity date, Vermont National renewed the Liftline loan for a five year period to mature on June 5, 1993.  Vermont National continued to remit and Baybank continued to accept without comment its 90% interest in Liftline's payments on the loan.  By February, 1991, however, due to a series of poor ski seasons, Liftline defaulted on the loan and filed for bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon Liftline's default, Baybank cooperated with Vermont National in trying to resolve the Liftline situation favorably.  Baybank neither demanded payment in full of its 90% share of the loan nor asserted that it had never agreed to participate in the 1988 renewal.  It was not until 1993 that Baybank first alleged that it never intended to participate in the renewal and filed this complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its complaint, Baybank sought damages arising from Vermont National's alleged breach of the participation agreement.  Baybank claimed that the participation agreement did not extend to the renewal and, therefore, Vermont National owed Baybank its 90% share of the loan at maturity on June 5, 1988.  Baybank based its claims for conversion, breach of trust and breach of fiduciary duty on this same allegation.  Alternatively, Baybank contended that, even if the participation agreement extended to the renewal, Vermont National breached the agreement by failing to provide Baybank with items of financial information as the agreement required.  The district court granted summary judgment against Baybank on all counts.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the award of summary judgment de novo.

Summary judgment is appropriate in the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, when the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

Finding the agreement ambiguous, the district court admitted extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent as an aid in its construction of the agreement.  The court concluded that Baybank had agreed to participate in the renewal.  On appeal Baybank contends that the contract was not ambiguous, and that even if it was, the evidence at a minimum precluded summary judgment on its claims.  We examine each of Baybank's arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>A. Was the Participation Agreement Ambiguous?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that pursuant to the participation agreement, Vermont law governs this dispute.  See Miniter Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Ohio Indemnity Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197358\"><a href=\"/opinion/197358/miniter-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1240</span></a></span>, 1245 (1st Cir.1997) (indicating that where parties agree as to what law governs, federal court sitting in diversity is free to forego an independent analysis and may accept the parties' agreement).  The parties also agree that the participation agreement misidentified several terms of the actual agreement, specifically, the amount of the loan and the origination and maturity dates.  Baybank characterizes these as \"scrivener's errors\" and contends that under Vermont law the participation agreement reflects no substantive ambiguity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Vermont, whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  See Breslauer v. Fayston Sch. Dist., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">416</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2328366\"><a href=\"/opinion/2328366/breslauer-v-fayston-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">659</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span>, 1135 (1995);  Isbrandtsen v.

Vermont law, however, does not restrict courts making that inquiry to the four corners of a written agreement.  Instead, courts may consider extrinsic evidence of \"the circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement as well as the object, nature and subject matter of the writing,\" Breslauer, 659 A.2d at 1135 (internal quotation omitted), and will find ambiguity in the event that a writing in itself supports a different interpretation than that which appears when read in light of the surrounding circumstances, See Isbrandtsen, 556 A.2d at 84.   Both interpretations, however, must be reasonable in order to establish ambiguity.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On its face the participation agreement seems unambiguous.  The parties, however, agree that the amounts and dates in the agreement do not reflect their actual understanding, and each party directs us to extrinsic evidence suggesting competing interpretations of the agreement.  That we must resort to extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties renders the contract necessarily ambiguous.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baybank argues unpersuasively that consideration of the participation certificate in conjunction with the participation agreement renders the latter unambiguous in Baybank's favor.  We recognize that the participation certificate, executed on the same date as the participation agreement, correctly states the amount of Baybank's participation and explicitly refers to the June 5, 1986 note which had a maturity date of June 5, 1988.  The participation certificate, however, neither references the participation agreement nor explicitly sets any parameters on Baybank's participation.  The certificate, in other words, does not definitively resolve the agreement's ambiguity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we assume that consideration of these two documents together results in one reasonable interpretation of the participation agreement, a host of extrinsic evidence in the record supports an alternative but equally reasonable interpretation.  Much of this evidence also bears on the substance of Baybank's breach of contract claim and we discuss it fully in our analysis of that claim.  We note only that Vermont law directs us to consider the circumstances surrounding the agreement;  it does not direct us to select a single circumstance which if considered in a vacuum might resolve the ambiguity.  See Breslauer, 659 A.2d at 1135 (directing courts to consider evidence on the circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement as well as the object, nature and subject matter of the agreement itself).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>B. Does the Participation Agreement Contemplate the Renewal?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts faced with ambiguity in a contract resort to \"subordinate rules of construction,\" see Isbrandtsen, 556 A.2d at 85, including consideration of extrinsic evidence, see Abbiati v. Buttura &amp; Sons, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2197130\"><a href=\"/opinion/2197130/abbiati-v-buttura-sons-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">639</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span>, 991 (1994), to determine the proper construction of the contract.  The proper construction is that which reflects or effectuates the intent of the parties.  See Abbiati, 639 A.2d at 991.   In any given case relevance guides the use of extrinsic evidence.  Some of the same evidence that may bear on whether a written contract is ambiguous may also cast light on the proper interpretation of the language upon a finding of ambiguity.  See, e.g., id. at 991 (indicating that circumstances under which the contract arose are relevant in determining intent of parties).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally, the construction of a contract is a question of law.  See Morrisseau v. Fayette, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1436674\"><a href=\"/opinion/1436674/morrisseau-v-fayette/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">820</span></a></span>, 826 (1995).  \"[W]here the meaning of a contract is uncertain,\" however, \"the intent of the parties becomes a question of fact.\"  Housing Vt. v. Goldsmith &amp; Morris, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2304761\"><a href=\"/opinion/2304761/housing-vermont-v-goldsmith-morris/\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1086</span></a></span>, 1088 (Vt.1996).  In this case, therefore, we must determine whether the record contains sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that Baybank did not intend to participate in the renewal.  We conclude that the record in this case allows for no such dispute.  Instead it reflects that the parties intended the participation agreement to extend to the renewal, and, therefore, the district court appropriately granted summary judgment in favor of Vermont National.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From Baybank's negotiations with Vermont National prior to June 5, 1988, the date that Baybank now claims marked the end of its participation period, until September of 1993, when Baybank filed its complaint, Baybank repeatedly reaffirmed its understanding that its participation extended to the renewal.  George Todd Marchant, Vice President in Baybank's commercial loan department and member of Baybank's loan committee, negotiated the initial participation agreement with Louis Dunham, Executive Vice President of Vermont National.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Marchant testified that he and Dunham discussed the anticipated renewal of the Liftline loan scheduled to occur six weeks after Baybank purchased its participation, and that the loan committee's approval of participation in the Liftline loan included participation in the renewal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Marchant further testified that a handwritten note in the top corner of one of the loan documents produced from Baybank's file read \"per Lou, this note will be renewed on the same terms.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From September 1991 to spring 1993, David Hobert, then an account officer with Baybank, served as the participating agent in the loan.  In this capacity, Hobert oversaw the relationship between Baybank and Vermont National pertinent to the Liftline loan and worked with officials at Vermont National \"in administering the direction of the loan and foreclosure.\"   Hobert testified that when he assumed oversight of the loan, nearly two years after the maturity date to which Baybank now clings, \"it was understood that [Baybank] had a 90% participation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On behalf of Baybank, Hobert worked closely with Vermont National as the two banks considered their options and planned their workout strategies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a>  Hobert visited the Liftline lodge in 1992, nearly four years after the maturity date Baybank claims, to examine the collateral and participate in negotiations with the lodge owners on clearing the debt.  Hobert testified that he made this trip because Baybank \"was a 90% participant in the loan,\" and he was invited to inspect the property with the lead bank.  On behalf of Baybank, Hobert also proposed a settlement with Liftline's guarantors and proposed that Baybank and Vermont National form a corporation of which Baybank would own 90% and Vermont National would own 10%, for the purpose of taking title to the property and other assets of Liftline.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Documentary evidence from Baybank's files throughout the life of the loan further undermines Baybank's renewal claim.  In October 1988 and again in 1989, Baybank sent Vermont National \"audit confirmation\" notices requesting Vermont National to submit information regarding Baybank's interest in the Liftline loan.  Both of the notices reflect a due date or maturity date of June 5, 1993, which corresponds with the maturity date of the renewed loan.  Watch List Reports, in which Baybank lists \"troubled\" loans requiring additional monitoring, listed the Liftline loan and specifically indicated an origination date of April 25, 1988 and a maturity date of June 5, 1993.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As indicated, the question of the intent of the parties to an ambiguous agreement is one of fact.  See Housing Vt., 685 A.2d at 1088.   In this case Baybank has failed to identify any evidence that would place its intent to participate in the renewal in dispute.  Instead, the record in this case establishes beyond question that Baybank intended to and did participate in the renewal of the Liftline loan.  Accordingly, the district court correctly granted summary judgment in favor of Vermont National.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>C. Did Vermont National Commit Other Breaches of the Participation Agreement?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baybank contends that even if the participation agreement did extend to the renewal, Vermont National breached the agreement by failing to provide it with certain information the agreement required.  Baybank also claims that Vermont National settled a claim against the individual guarantors over Baybank's objection in contravention of the participation agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>  We find neither of these arguments persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The participation agreement provides:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p>As long as the Participating Bank continues to have an ownership interest in the Loan, the Originating Bank agrees to regularly provide the Participating Bank with complete and current credit related and other information concerning the Borrower, the Loan and the collateral securing the Loan....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Baybank points us to the deposition testimony of Kathleen Mullin and David Hobert, Baybank employees who oversaw the loan at different points during its existence.  The district court reviewed both of these sources and determined that they failed to establish even a dispute of fact as to whether Vermont National breached the participation in this way.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not revisit this evidence in detail.  Mullin testified that she could not remember specifically what Vermont National had failed to provide and what she had or had not received.  Hobert professed no knowledge as to why Baybank had not received certain documents, specifically, whether it was due to Vermont National's delinquency or that of the debtors or guarantors.  Mullin and Hobert simply could not recollect exactly what information Baybank had in its possession, what information Baybank sought and what information Vermont National failed to produce.  In short, we agree with the district court that their testimony fails to raise any genuine issue of material fact on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Baybank argues that Vermont National breached the participation agreement by settling a claim against the individual guarantors of the Liftline loan.  The participation agreement prohibited Vermont National from \"waiv[ing] or releas[ing] any claim against any Borrower and/or against any co-maker, guarantor or endorser under the Loan.\"  Baybank directs us to the affidavit of Richard Butler, Senior Vice President of Baybank, who claims that Vermont National settled against the guarantors in contravention of Baybank's instructions.  This conclusory assertion simply mischaracterizes the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record reveals that on April 15, 1993, Mark LaPointe of Vermont National and David Hobert met with attorneys for the guarantors.  Hobert, not LaPointe, proposed a settlement but failed to reach an agreement with the guarantors.  A memorandum dated April 20, 1993, the veracity of which Baybank does not dispute, memorializes this meeting.  The guarantors then moved to enforce a settlement agreement in bankruptcy court despite the fact that none of the parties had agreed to final terms of settlement.  Vermont National and Baybank both opposed the motion.  The bankruptcy court, however, granted the motion, effectively forcing settlement upon the banks.  Butler's conclusory allegations fail to raise a genuine issue of material fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found no error, we conclude that the district court appropriately granted summary judgment in favor of Vermont National on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.

Neither our research nor that of the parties has uncovered any Vermont authority suggesting a more appropriate analytical approach</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Without regard to the legal strategy of either party, we note that neither of the litigants sought rescission and reformation on the basis of mistake.  In Vermont, \"[r]eformation is appropriate when an agreement has been made, or a transaction has been entered into or determined upon, ..., but in reducing such agreement or transaction in writing, the written instrument fails to express the real agreement or transaction.\"  LaRock v.

Reformation of this agreement would require a consideration of any extrinsic evidence of the terms of the actual agreement which the writing in question failed to record.  See Paradise Restaurant, Inc. v. Somerset Enters., Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Vt.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1437529\"><a href=\"/opinion/1437529/paradise-restaurant-v-somerset-enterprises/\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></a></span>, 1262 (1995).  Whether through reformation or through a finding of ambiguity, therefore, we would need to construe the agreement through relevant extrinsic evidence.  As the parties have chosen the route of ambiguity, we let that doctrine frame our analysis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The loan committee at Baybank had final authority to approve loans in which Baybank sought to participate</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Marchant testified that he recalled a three year renewal rather than the five year renewal Vermont National asserts.  To the extent that fact is in dispute, it is not material to Baybank's claim;  Baybank does not dispute the length of time of any renewal to which it agreed.  Instead, Baybank argues, it never agreed to any renewal at all</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The testimony of Louis Dunham, Executive Vice President of Vermont National, corroborates Marchant's understanding of the scope of the participation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Interestingly, rather than immediately file the present complaint against Vermont National, shortly after default Baybank filed suit in state court in Massachusetts against guarantors of the loan</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Our conclusion that Baybank intended to participate in the renewal also forecloses Baybank's claims for conversion, breach of trust, and breach of fiduciary duty, all of which Baybank premises on its argument that the participation agreement required Vermont National to remit Baybank's 90% participation on June 5, 1988 rather than roll the funds into the renewal.  With respect to conversion and breach of trust, Baybank fails to establish that Vermont National did anything impermissible with Baybank's participation interest.  If we accept Baybank's assertion that Vermont National had a fiduciary duty to Baybank at least with respect to paying Baybank its share of the Liftline loan proceeds, Baybank fails to establish any conduct by Vermont National that constitutes a breach of that duty.  Vermont National continued paying Baybank its participation share of the monthly payments until the default, and Baybank continued to accept those payments.  After the bankruptcy court provided Vermont National with adequate protection payments on the Liftline loan, Vermont National forwarded Baybank 90% of each monthly payment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Baybank insists that it adduced \"strong evidence\" that Vermont National and Liftline did not actually execute the original loan on June 5, 1986, but rather backdated the note to reflect that date.  According to Baybank, but for the backdating, the note was actually in default, and the participation agreement required Vermont National to inform Baybank of any default.  Baybank's brief, one-paragraph discussion of this argument offers us no compelling reason to repeat the district court's thorough analysis or to disturb the court's legal conclusions</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
