Upon careful review of the  record and the\r                           \r\n\nbriefs, we conclude that the credibility issue raised in this\r\n\nappeal  was  substantially  and  correctly  addressed by  the\r\n\ndistrict  court's Opinion  and Order,  dated  July 31,  1997.\r\n\nAccordingly, we  affirm  the  judgment  for  essentially  the\r\n\nreasons stated in that Opinion and Order.\r\n\n     We add only  this comment.  We find  no reversible error\r\n\nin the appeals  council's finding that \"the  medical evidence\r\n\ndoes not indicate  clinical or laboratory findings  showing a\r\n\nworsening of [claimant's] condition.\"  Contrary to claimant's\r\n\nargument,  the  additional  evidence  about  his   increasing\r\n\nmedications  and doctor visits did not necessarily contradict\r\n\nthat finding. \r\n\n     Affirmed.  See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.1.\r                               \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n",
