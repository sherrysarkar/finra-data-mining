On March 25, 1988, Welch designated R.W. as\r\n\nits  new Puerto  Rico distributor  for frozen  juice concentrate.\r\n\nWhile the parties  continued to  negotiate the terms  of a  final\r\n\ndealership  contract, R.W. began  distributing Welch  products to\r\n\nover 500 retail stores throughout Puerto Rico.  \r\n\n          Prior to R.W.'s  designation as its  distributor, Welch\r\n\nhad expressed  concern about  R.W.'s insistence on  continuing to\r\n\ndistribute \"Donald  Duck\" frozen  juice concentrate,  a competing\r\n\nbrand,  and on its plans  to begin distribution  of \"Donald Duck\"\r\n\nbottled juice products in  January 1989.  Consequently,  R.W. had\r\n\nagreed,  in  principle,  to  take various  measures  designed  to\r\n\nalleviate Welch's concerns, including a one-year trial dealership\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1The  facts are stated in the light most favorable to appel-\r\nlant  R.W.  The  reader is referred to  our two earlier decisions\r\nfor additional detail.  See R.W. Int'l Corp. v. Welch Food, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n13 F.3d 478 (1st Cir.  1994); R.W. Int'l Corp., 937 F.2d  11 (1st\r                                                        \r\nCir. 1991).  \r\n\n                                2\r\r\n\nduring which R.W.  would give Welch's  frozen juice product  full\r\n\nmarketing  priority and  support, increase  Welch's sales  by 15%\r\n\nover 1987  sales figures, and  contribute $50,000 toward  a joint\r\n\nadvertising promotion of Welch's juice products.  Notwithstanding\r\n\ntheir agreement in principle, final contract negotiations between\r\n\nthe  parties immediately  and unexpectedly became  contentious in\r\n\nseveral peripheral  respects which  remained unresolved for  more\r\n\nthan a year.2 \r\n\n          In  January 1989,  after  R.W.  began its  long-planned\r\n\nexpansion of the \"Donald Duck\" distribution line to include  both\r\n\nfrozen and bottled juices, Welch  employees noticed that (i) R.W.\r\n\nhad included an advertisement  for Donald Duck frozen juice  in a\r\n\nsupermarket \"shopper\" publication,  while omitting an  advertise-\r\n\nment for Welch frozen juice; (ii) \"on various occasions\" R.W. had\r                        \r\n\nstocked  Welch frozen juice on the bottom shelves of retail store\r                        \r\n\nfreezer cases, while placing Donald Duck frozen juice at customer\r\n\neye-level;  and (iii)  R.W.'s average  monthly sales  figures for\r\n\nWelch products during January-February 1989 fell by approximately\r\n\n14% from its average monthly sales figures for 1988.3  \r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2The matters in contention included whether:   R.W. would be\r\nWelch's exclusive  Puerto Rico  dealer during the  one-year trial\r\nperiod; New York  or Puerto  Rico law would  govern any  contract\r\ndispute;  R.W. would  \"assume\"  the  \"grandfathered\" contract  of\r\nWelch's previous dealer, thereby avoiding application of Law 75.\r\n\n     3During  the one-year  dealership relationship,  Welch juice\r\nsales were as follows:\r\n\n     April 1988          1900 cases          $ 42,770\r\n     May 1988            3060 cases          $ 70,354\r\n     June 1988           2983 cases          $ 63,971\r\n     July 1988           3005 cases          $ 64,056\r\n\n                                3\r\r\n\n          On  March 30,  1989,  Welch  discontinued the  yearlong\r\n\ncontract negotiations and unilaterally terminated  R.W.'s dealer-\r\n\nship.   Welch  pointed to  the \"conflicts  of interest  of [R.W.]\r\n\nrepresenting both competing lines  [i.e., Welch and Donald Duck],\r\n\n[which] are significant and irreconcilable, [and] [a]n  increased\r\n\nlevel of conflict in personal relations between [us].\"\r\n\n          In  April 1989,  R.W. filed  this action  alleging that\r\n\nWelch's unilateral termination of the dealership violated Law 75,\r\n\nwhich provides: \r\n\n          Notwithstanding the existence  in a  dealer's\r\n          contract of a clause reserving to the parties\r\n          the unilateral right to terminate  the exist-\r\n          ing relationship, no principal or grantor may\r\n          directly or indirectly perform any act detri-\r\n          mental [i.e., unilateral termination]  to the\r\n          established relationship or  refuse to  renew\r\n          said contract  on its normal  expiration, ex-\r                                                                 \r\n          cept for just cause.\r                                       \r\n\nP.R.  Laws Ann. tit. 10,    278a (1976  and Supp. 1989) (emphasis\r\n\nadded).   The district  court initially entered  summary judgment\r\n\nfor Welch  on the ground  that Law 75  afforded no  protection to\r\n\ndealers  unless a  final,  written \"dealer's  contract\" has  been\r\n\nexecuted by the parties.

Int'l, 13 F.3d at 486 (holding\r                                                  \r\n\nthat  the broad definition of \"dealer's contract\" in Law 75 would\r\n\ncomprehend dealers actually engaging in  product distribution for\r\n\na principal, albeit  only through a  course of dealing  preceding\r                             \r\n\nthe  execution of a final contract), Welch renewed its motion for\r\n\nsummary  judgment.   It  contended that  the undisputed  evidence\r\n\nestablished that R.W.'s demonstrated conflict of interest consti-\r\n\ntuted  \"just cause,\" under Law 75, for terminating their one-year\r\n\ndealership.    The  district  court once  again  entered  summary\r\n\njudgment for Welch and R.W. appealed.\r\n\n                           DISCUSSION4\r                                     DISCUSSION\r                                               \r\n\n          The Puerto  Rico Legislature  enacted Law  75 believing\r\n\nthat traditional contract-law  principles had not afforded  local\r\n\ndealers  adequate  protection   from  arbitrary   dealer-contract\r\n\nterminations by larger, primarily mainland-based principals which\r\n\nnormally enjoy a superior bargaining position.

As  R.W. proffered  no competent evidence  to rebut  the\r\n\nhistorical facts  relied on  by Welch  to justify  its unilateral\r\n\ntermination      i.e.,  declining  sales figures,  the  \"shopper\"\r\n\nomission, or the  bottom-shelf freezer placements    we need only\r\n\nask  whether a rational jury  could find mala  fides or unreason-\r                                                              \r\n\nableness  on the  part  of Welch  in  determining that  R.W.  was\r\n\nrepresenting conflicting interests. \r\n\n          Even before  R.W.'s March 1988 designation,  Welch made\r\n\nclear that  it appreciated R.W.'s distribution  capabilities, but\r\n\nwas  extremely wary of its  handling of Donald  Duck frozen juice\r\n\nconcentrate and  of its plans  to begin distributing  Donald Duck\r\n\nbottled juice  in January 1989.   In order to get  the Welch con-\r\n\ntract,  Thomas Ward,  R.W.'s  president, agreed  to the  one-year\r\n\ntrial  period,  the  sales-volume  commitments,  and  the  mutual\r\n\nadvertising expenditures.   The parties understood  that the one-\r\n\nyear  trial period would allow Welch to assess whether R.W. could\r\n\ndistribute Donald  Duck products while meeting  its obligation to\r\n\nprovide full  marketing support for  Welch products.   In January\r\n\n1989, however,  there were strong signals that  R.W. was shifting\r\n\nits  primary attention to its newly expanded Donald Duck line, at\r\n\nWelch's  expense.   Although R.W.  plausibly suggests  that these\r\n\nindicia were  either ambiguous,  anecdotal, or  aberrational, and\r\n\nthat genuine factual issues  may well remain as to  whether these\r\n\nindicia  signaled  a  \"contract\"  breach  or  other  sufficiently\r\n\n\"adverse\"  action by R.W.  under P.R. Laws  Ann. tit.  10,   278,\r\n\nR.W.  has not shown that it was unreasonable for Welch, acting in\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\npresumed good  faith, to interpret these signals  as portending a\r\n\ntroubled business  relationship ahead,  and to withdraw  from it.\r\n\nCf. Newell, 20 F.3d  at 23 (upholding verdict for  dealer because\r                    \r\n\nprincipal  had known for twenty-three  years that dealer had been\r\n\nmarketing  competing product).   Given that  Welch already  had a\r\n\nfifty-year presence  in the Puerto Rico  market before appointing\r\n\nR.W. in 1988, and that the parties reached a bona fide impasse on\r                                                                \r\n\nan  essential modification to the terms of their ongoing dealer's\r\n\n\"contract\" (i.e., whether R.W. would continue to handle competing\r\n\nproduct lines), we conclude  that a rational jury could  not find\r\n\nthat Welch acted  in \"bad faith.\"   Accordingly, summary judgment\r\n\nwas proper.\r\n\n          The judgment is affirmed.\r                    The judgment is affirmed.\r                                            \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n",

Consequently, R.W. had agreed, in principle, to take various measures designed to alleviate Welch's concerns, including a one-year trial dealership during which R.W. would give Welch's frozen juice product full marketing priority and support, increase Welch's sales by 15% over 1987 sales figures, and contribute $50,000 toward a joint advertising promotion of Welch's juice products.

It contended that the undisputed evidence established that R.W.'s demonstrated conflict of interest constituted \"just cause,\" under Law 75, for terminating their one-year dealership.

Moreover, once a dealer demonstrates that its principal unilaterally terminated their contract, the principal must carry the burden of persuasion on the factual elements of the \"just cause\" showing.

Rather, R.W. merely argues that divergent inferences might be drawn from these undisputed facts, bearing on the issues of \"essentiality\" and \"adversity\" upon which Welch would be required to bear the burden of proof at trial, and that these competing inferences generated trialworthy issues not amenable to summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even conceding the reasonableness of any such competing inferences, however, R.W.'s protestation that it committed no cognizable breach of \"contract,\" or other act or omission sufficiently \"adverse\" to Welch's business interests to warrant termination, would not preclude summary judgment for Welch.   Although Law 75, by its plain terms, makes the \"just cause\" inquiry turn solely on the dealer's actions or omissions, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 278, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has read a \"third\" \"just cause\" into the statute to avoid constitutional invalidation, by holding that a principal's own circumstances may permit its unilateral termination of an ongoing dealership, irrespective of the dealer's conduct.   See Medina &amp; Medina v. Country Pride Foods, Ltd., 858 F.2d 817, 822-23 (1st Cir.1988) (responding to question certified in 825 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the principal in Medina unsuccessfully attempted in protracted good-faith negotiations to adjust its business to changed market conditions by renegotiating price and credit terms with its long-time dealer, it decided to terminate the dealer's contract, and withdraw from the Puerto Rico market.  Id. at 818-19.   The Medina court noted that an overly restrictive interpretation of Law 75's \"just cause\" requirement could place a principal in a serious dilemma under such circumstances:  either capitulate to the dealer's price and credit terms and be held hostage in an interminable dealership relationship on disadvantageous terms, or unilaterally terminate the contract and expose itself to a costly lawsuit under Law 75.  Id. at 822 &amp; n. 4. Where the principal intends to retire entirely from the Puerto Rico market, however, little if any danger exists that the sort of exploitation proscribed by Law 75 can occur, since the retiring principal cannot hope to appropriate prospectively the product goodwill created by its dealer in the Puerto Rico market.  Id. at 823.   Thus, where the principal offers \"reasonable\" contract terms, but nonetheless arrives at a bona fide impasse in the negotiations, barring unusual circumstances not present here Medina ordains a determination that there was \"just cause\" for the unilateral dealership termination by the principal.   See id.;   see also Borg Warner Int'l Corp. v. Quasar Co., No. CE-94-182, slip op. at 10 n. 8 (P.R.

State Farm Mut. Auto.  Ins. Co., 989 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993).   In fact, this court predicted earlier that upon remand and further discovery Welch's asserted reasons for terminating R.W. might constitute \"just cause\" as enunciated in Medina:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>[W]e fail to see how applying Law 75 in the circumstances of this case necessarily would require Welch to continue a relationship it does not want in a manner to which it has serious objections.   Law 75 simply requires a supplier to justify its decision to terminate a dealership.   If Welch's conflict-of-interest concerns about R.W. are legitimate, we have no doubt that this would constitute \"just cause\" under Law 75....  Medina &amp; Medina is not precisely on point because it involved a supplier's decision to totally withdraw from the Puerto Rico market following good-faith negotiations that failed to achieve agreement between the parties.   There is no indication here that Welch intended to leave the market rather than find a new dealer.   Nevertheless, we believe the principle underlying Medina &amp; Medina is equally applicable in these circumstances, i.e., that a supplier has just cause to terminate if it has bargained in good faith but has not been able \"to reach an agreement as to price, credit, or some other essential element of the dealership.\"   This would be true at least where, as here, the supplier's market in Puerto Rico was well established before the current dealer relationship and the supplier's action therefore \"is not aimed at reaping the good will or clientele established by the dealer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">R.W.

Nonetheless, whereas the ultimate burden to prove \"just cause\" under the two-part statutory definition resides with the principal (i.e., Welch), see Newell, 20 F.3d at 22, the bona fides of contract negotiations must be presumed under Puerto Rico law.   See Borg Warner, No. CE-94-182, slip op. at 10 n. 8. Consequently, at trial R.W. would bear the burden to establish Welch's bad faith for purposes of the Medina \"just cause\" determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">R.W. has not met its burden as a nonmoving party under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.

As R.W. proffered no competent evidence to rebut the historical facts relied on by Welch to justify its unilateral termination--i.e., declining sales figures, the \"shopper\" omission, or the bottom-shelf freezer placements--we need only ask whether a rational jury could find mala fides or unreasonableness on the part of Welch in determining that R.W. was representing conflicting interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even before R.W.'s March 1988 designation, Welch made clear that it appreciated R.W.'s distribution capabilities, but was extremely wary of its handling of Donald Duck frozen juice concentrate and of its plans to begin distributing Donald Duck bottled juice in January 1989.   In order to get the Welch contract, Thomas Ward, R.W.'s president, agreed to the one-year trial period, the sales-volume commitments, and the mutual advertising expenditures.   The parties understood that the one-year trial period would allow Welch to assess whether R.W. could distribute Donald Duck products while meeting its obligation to provide full marketing support for Welch products.   In January 1989, however, there were strong signals that R.W. was shifting its primary attention to its newly expanded Donald Duck line, at Welch's expense.   Although R.W. plausibly suggests that these indicia were either ambiguous, anecdotal, or aberrational, and that genuine factual issues may well remain as to whether these indicia signaled a \"contract\" breach or other sufficiently \"adverse\" action by R.W. under P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 278, R.W. has not shown that it was unreasonable for Welch, acting in presumed good faith, to interpret these signals as portending a troubled business relationship ahead, and to withdraw from it.   Cf. Newell, 20 F.3d at 23 (upholding verdict for dealer because principal had known for twenty-three years that dealer had been marketing competing product).   Given that Welch already had a fifty-year presence in the Puerto Rico market before appointing R.W. in 1988, and that the parties reached a bona fide impasse on an essential modification to the terms of their ongoing dealer's \"contract\" (i.e., whether R.W. would continue to handle competing product lines), we conclude that a rational jury could not find that Welch acted in \"bad faith.\"   Accordingly, summary judgment was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The facts are stated in the light most favorable to appellant R.W.

Consequently, R.W. had agreed, in principle, to take various measures designed to alleviate Welch's concerns, including a one-year trial dealership during which R.W. would give Welch's frozen juice product full marketing priority and support, increase Welch's sales by 15% over 1987 sales figures, and contribute $50,000 toward a joint advertising promotion of Welch's juice products.

Rather, R.W. merely argues that divergent inferences might be drawn from these undisputed facts, bearing on the issues of \"essentiality\" and \"adversity\" upon which Welch would be required to bear the burden of proof at trial, and that these competing inferences generated trialworthy issues not amenable to summary judgment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even conceding the reasonableness of any such competing inferences, however, R.W.'s protestation that it committed no cognizable breach of \"contract,\" or other act or omission sufficiently \"adverse\" to Welch's business interests to warrant termination, would not preclude summary judgment for Welch.   Although Law 75, by its plain terms, makes the \"just cause\" inquiry turn solely on the dealer's actions or omissions, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 278, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has read a \"third\" \"just cause\" into the statute to avoid constitutional invalidation, by holding that a principal's own circumstances may permit its unilateral termination of an ongoing dealership, irrespective of the dealer's conduct.   See Medina &amp; Medina v. Country Pride Foods, Ltd., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"512579\"><a href=\"/opinion/512579/medina-medina-v-country-pride-foods-ltd-medina-medina-v-country/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span>, 822-23 (1st Cir.1988) (responding to question certified in <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492052\"><a href=\"/opinion/492052/medina-medina-v-country-pride-foods-ltd-medina-medina-v-country/\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1987)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the principal in Medina unsuccessfully attempted in protracted good-faith negotiations to adjust its business to changed market conditions by renegotiating price and credit terms with its long-time dealer, it decided to terminate the dealer's contract, and withdraw from the Puerto Rico market.  Id. at 818-19.   The Medina court noted that an overly restrictive interpretation of Law 75's \"just cause\" requirement could place a principal in a serious dilemma under such circumstances:  either capitulate to the dealer's price and credit terms and be held hostage in an interminable dealership relationship on disadvantageous terms, or unilaterally terminate the contract and expose itself to a costly lawsuit under Law 75.  Id. at 822 &amp; n. 4. Where the principal intends to retire entirely from the Puerto Rico market, however, little if any danger exists that the sort of exploitation proscribed by Law 75 can occur, since the retiring principal cannot hope to appropriate prospectively the product goodwill created by its dealer in the Puerto Rico market.  Id. at 823.   Thus, where the principal offers \"reasonable\" contract terms, but nonetheless arrives at a bona fide impasse in the negotiations, barring unusual circumstances not present here Medina ordains a determination that there was \"just cause\" for the unilateral dealership termination by the principal.   See id.;   see also Borg Warner Int'l Corp. v. Quasar Co., No. CE-94-182, slip op. at 10 n. 8 (P.R.

In fact, this court predicted earlier that upon remand and further discovery Welch's asserted reasons for terminating R.W. might constitute \"just cause\" as enunciated in Medina:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>[W]e fail to see how applying Law 75 in the circumstances of this case necessarily would require Welch to continue a relationship it does not want in a manner to which it has serious objections.   Law 75 simply requires a supplier to justify its decision to terminate a dealership.   If Welch's conflict-of-interest concerns about R.W. are legitimate, we have no doubt that this would constitute \"just cause\" under Law 75....  Medina &amp; Medina is not precisely on point because it involved a supplier's decision to totally withdraw from the Puerto Rico market following good-faith negotiations that failed to achieve agreement between the parties.   There is no indication here that Welch intended to leave the market rather than find a new dealer.   Nevertheless, we believe the principle underlying Medina &amp; Medina is equally applicable in these circumstances, i.e., that a supplier has just cause to terminate if it has bargained in good faith but has not been able \"to reach an agreement as to price, credit, or some other essential element of the dealership.\"   This would be true at least where, as here, the supplier's market in Puerto Rico was well established before the current dealer relationship and the supplier's action therefore \"is not aimed at reaping the good will or clientele established by the dealer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">R.W.

Nonetheless, whereas the ultimate burden to prove \"just cause\" under the two-part statutory definition resides with the principal (i.e., Welch), see Newell, 20 F.3d at 22, the bona fides of contract negotiations must be presumed under Puerto Rico law.   See Borg Warner, No. CE-94-182, slip op. at 10 n. 8. Consequently, at trial R.W. would bear the burden to establish Welch's bad faith for purposes of the Medina \"just cause\" determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">R.W. has not met its burden as a nonmoving party under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.

As R.W. proffered no competent evidence to rebut the historical facts relied on by Welch to justify its unilateral termination--i.e., declining sales figures, the \"shopper\" omission, or the bottom-shelf freezer placements--we need only ask whether a rational jury could find mala fides or unreasonableness on the part of Welch in determining that R.W. was representing conflicting interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even before R.W.'s March 1988 designation, Welch made clear that it appreciated R.W.'s distribution capabilities, but was extremely wary of its handling of Donald Duck frozen juice concentrate and of its plans to begin distributing Donald Duck bottled juice in January 1989.   In order to get the Welch contract, Thomas Ward, R.W.'s president, agreed to the one-year trial period, the sales-volume commitments, and the mutual advertising expenditures.   The parties understood that the one-year trial period would allow Welch to assess whether R.W. could distribute Donald Duck products while meeting its obligation to provide full marketing support for Welch products.   In January 1989, however, there were strong signals that R.W. was shifting its primary attention to its newly expanded Donald Duck line, at Welch's expense.   Although R.W. plausibly suggests that these indicia were either ambiguous, anecdotal, or aberrational, and that genuine factual issues may well remain as to whether these indicia signaled a \"contract\" breach or other sufficiently \"adverse\" action by R.W. under P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 278, R.W. has not shown that it was unreasonable for Welch, acting in presumed good faith, to interpret these signals as portending a troubled business relationship ahead, and to withdraw from it.   Cf. Newell, 20 F.3d at 23 (upholding verdict for dealer because principal had known for twenty-three years that dealer had been marketing competing product).   Given that Welch already had a fifty-year presence in the Puerto Rico market before appointing R.W. in 1988, and that the parties reached a bona fide impasse on an essential modification to the terms of their ongoing dealer's \"contract\" (i.e., whether R.W. would continue to handle competing product lines), we conclude that a rational jury could not find that Welch acted in \"bad faith.\"   Accordingly, summary judgment was proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The facts are stated in the light most favorable to appellant R.W.
