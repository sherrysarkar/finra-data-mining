He  was  charged  with\r\n\nconspiring  to distribute  drugs, 21  U.S.C.    846, and  one\r\n\ncount  each  of  possession  with intent  to  distribute  and\r\n\ndistribution,  21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1).   On March  8, 1995, De\r\n\nLaCruz  pled guilty  to all  counts.   The quantity  of drugs\r\n\ntriggered a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence.  21 U.S.C.  \r\n\n841(b)(1)(A)(iii).  \r\n\n     De  LaCruz suffers  from a  terminal illness  and likely\r\n\nwill not survive  the mandatory minimum term.   At sentencing\r\n\nin November  1995, De LaCruz sought relief  under the \"safety\r\n\nvalve\" provision,  18 U.S.C.    3553(f) and U.S.S.G    5C1.2,\r\n\nwhich would allow him--if he met the five  criteria--to avoid\r\n\nthe mandatory minimum and  be sentenced under the guidelines.\r\n\nThe court calculated his guidelines range to be 87-108 months\r\n\n(including  probable  departures), and  De  LaCruz asked  for\r\n\nseveral additional departures to further reduce his sentence.\r\n\n     The government argued that  De LaCruz was ineligible for\r\n\nrelief under  section 3553(f)  because  he had  not made  the\r\n\ndisclosure of  information  about the  offenses  required  by\r\n\nsubsection (5).  The court disagreed but found that De LaCruz\r\n\nfailed  a  different  condition--subsection  (4)--because  he\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\ncontrolled the drug enterprise.  The safety valve is aimed at\r\n\nless culpable  defendants and applies only  if \"the defendant\r\n\nwas  not  an organizer,  leader,  manager,  or supervisor  of\r\n\nothers in the  offense.\"  18  U.S.C.   3553(f)(4).   The main\r\n\nissue on appeal is  whether this fact-bound determination was\r\n\nclear  error.  United States v.  Montanez, No. 95-2096, slip.\r                                                     \r\n\nop. at 10  (1st Cir. Apr. 24, 1996).   The pertinent evidence\r\n\nis as follows.\r\n\n     On August 21,  1994, an  agent went to  an apartment  at\r\n\nCherry Street  in Pawtucket,  Rhode Island, and  bought crack\r\n\nfrom Vidal and another unidentified man.  The agent went back\r\n\nlater  that month  to  buy more.   This  time only  Vidal was\r\n\npresent;  he telephoned  De  LaCruz, who  apparently had  the\r\n\ndrugs  at another location.   While waiting for  De LaCruz to\r\n\narrive, the agent gave Vidal $50 in marked bills.\r\n\n     De LaCruz  arrived a  short time  later with Ovando  and\r\n\ngave the agent  crack that  the agent had  already paid  for.\r\n\nOvando explained to the agent that she and De LaCruz would be\r\n\nmoving to a new address and that from now on the agent should\r\n\ngo  there if the  agent wanted more  drugs.   The agent left.\r\n\nMinutes later the defendants were arrested.  The $50 that the\r\n\nagent had given Vidal was found on De LaCruz.  \r\n\n     Agents subsequently searched an apartment at Rand Street\r\n\nin Central Falls, Rhode Island.  This apartment was leased to\r\n\nOvando; and she and De LaCruz  had been at the apartment (and\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\nunder surveillance) on August 21 when Vidal telephoned him to\r\n\narrange the  delivery.  This search  revealed scales, plastic\r\n\nbags  and other  drug-trade  paraphernalia and  also evidence\r\n\nindicating  that   De  LaCruz  also  occupied   or  used  the\r\n\napartment.  In an adjoining basement, agents found a stash of\r\n\n73.8 grams of crack  and $3900 in cash--including $60  of the\r\n\n$100 in marked  bills the  agent had given  Vidal during  the\r\n\nfirst buy. \r\n\n     At sentencing  De LaCruz insisted that he and Vidal were\r\n\nequal  partners and that Vidal  also had access  to the drugs\r\n\nand money at  Ovando's apartment.   In fact  Vidal's car  was\r\n\nregistered at that address.  But the district court concluded\r\n\nthat De LaCruz was \"in charge,\" finding that De LaCruz stored\r\n\nthe  drugs in the Rand Street apartment he shared with Ovando\r\n\nand supplied  them to Vidal,  who merely arranged  the sales.\r\n\nLater in the hearing, the district court said:\r\n\n          If he wasn't the leader I don't  know who was.\r\n     This is  a three  person  operation and  he was  in\r\n     charge.  It was  his operation.  What more  can you\r\n     do with it?  I  can't, I've wrestled with it  and I\r\n     can't.  I'd  like to give  him every opportunity  I\r\n     can to  go back to  the Dominican Republic  and die\r\n     with  his relatives.  But he's going to have to die\r\n     in a federal penitentiary, that's what it comes to.\r\n     And this is costly.   This is costly to  the United\r\n     States government.\r\n                            . . .\r\n\n          But that's the way it works.  I don't have the\r\n     discretion  to just  throw away  the guidelines  or\r\n     throw  away  Congress' mandatory  minimum sentences\r\n     and  so I  have to apply  them. .  . .   I  have no\r\n     choice, I have to apply the mandatory minimum which\r\n     is 120 months in prison.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     Conceivably, the district court  could have come out the\r\n\nother way.   The  probation officer recommended  applying the\r\n\nsafety  valve provision,  and  the prosecutor  expressed some\r\n\nreservation   at  sentencing  about  calling  De  LaCruz  the\r\n\n\"leader.\"   But the final  determination is for  the district\r\n\ncourt, and  it was rational  to conclude that  De LaCruz--who\r\n\nheld  the drugs and money--was in charge.  De LaCruz's equal-\r\n\npartners gloss  is  plausible but,  on appeal,  he bears  the\r\n\nburden  to show  clear  error and  cannot  prevail simply  by\r\n\nputting forth a reasonable alternative interpretation.  \r\n\n     This would resolve matters entirely but for the district\r\n\ncourt's brief  comment, \"[i]f  he wasn't  the leader  I don't\r\n\nknow who  was.\"  In the  abstract, this might  imply a belief\r\n\nthat someone is necessarily the leader in a group sale.  Such\r\n\na  belief would  be  error, since  equal  partners cannot  be\r\n\ndeemed leaders  unless one  or both  controlled others.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nU.S.S.G.    3B1.1;  United States  v. Frankenhauser,  1996 WL\r                                                               \r\n\n154266, at *11 (1st Cir. Apr. 9, 1996).  We think it far more\r\n\nlikely that the comment  was merely a way of  emphasizing the\r\n\ncourt's view that De LaCruz was in fact the leader.\r\n\n     De LaCruz may share this latter view because he does not\r\n\nraise this  issue on  appeal  and our  review is  accordingly\r\n\nlimited to \"plain error.\"  United States v. Olano, 113 S. Ct.\r                                                             \r\n\n1770, 1777-79 (1993).   It may be doubtful that  an ambiguous\r\n\nstatement  could qualify  as  plain error  although we  might\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\r\n\nstill be entitled  to seek clarification.   But relief  under\r\n\nOlano  still requires a  miscarriage of justice  or the like.\r                 \r\n\n113 S. Ct. at 1779.  For a reason not mentioned by either the\r\n\ndistrict court or the government, such a conclusion would  be\r\n\nhard to reach in this case.\r\n\n     Despite De LaCruz' attempt  to exculpate Ovando, her own\r\n\nrole in the August 24 sale indicates that she played a  minor\r\n\nrole  in the  transaction.   Indeed,  Ovando herself  pleaded\r\n\nguilty and De LaCruz  told his probation officer that  he was\r\n\n\"sorry for getting Johana Ovando implicated in something that\r\n\nreaped her  no benefit.\"  If he did not lead Vidal, De LaCruz\r\n\ncertainly appears to have  led Ovando.  See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nRamirez, 948  F.2d 66,  67  (1st Cir.  1991) (husband  deemed\r                   \r\n\nleader where wife a minor participant).\r\n\n     This is a distressing case.  The offenses underlying the\r\n\njudgment are serious, but few would think that they warranted\r\n\nhaving the defendant die in prison rather than in the care of\r\n\nhis  family  in his  own country.    But given  the mandatory\r\n\nminimum prescribed  by Congress,  it appears that  De LaCruz'\r\n\nonly avenue for relief is executive clemency.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r                         \r\n\n                             -6-\r                                         -6-\r\r\n",

For a reason not mentioned by either the district court or the government, such a conclusion would be hard to reach in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite De LaCruz' attempt to exculpate Ovando, her own role in the August 24 sale indicates that she played a minor role in the transaction.

He was charged with conspiring to distribute drugs, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 846, and one count each of possession with intent to distribute and distribution, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1).   On March 8, 1995, De LaCruz pled guilty to all counts.   The quantity of drugs triggered a mandatory minimum ten-year sentence.  21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)(iii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De LaCruz suffers from a terminal illness and likely will not survive the mandatory minimum term.   At sentencing in November 1995, De LaCruz sought relief under the \"safety valve\" provision, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f) and U.S.S.G &#167; 5C1.2, which would allow him--if he met the five criteria--to avoid the mandatory minimum and be sentenced under the guidelines.   The court calculated his guidelines range to be 87-108 months (including probable departures), and De LaCruz asked for several additional departures to further reduce his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argued that De LaCruz was ineligible for relief under section 3553(f) because he had not made the disclosure of information about the offenses required by subsection (5).   The court disagreed but found that De LaCruz failed a different condition--subsection (4)--because he controlled the drug enterprise.   The safety valve is aimed at less culpable defendants and applies only if \"the defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the offense.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(4).   The main issue on appeal is whether this fact-bound determination was clear error.   United States v. Montanez, No. 95-2096, slip. op. at 10 (1st Cir.  Apr. 24, 1996).   The pertinent evidence is as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 21, 1994, an agent went to an apartment at Cherry Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, and bought crack from Vidal and another unidentified man.   The agent went back later that month to buy more.   This time only Vidal was present;  he telephoned De LaCruz, who apparently had the drugs at another location.   While waiting for De LaCruz to arrive, the agent gave Vidal $50 in marked bills.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De LaCruz arrived a short time later with Ovando and gave the agent crack that the agent had already paid for.   Ovando explained to the agent that she and De LaCruz would be moving to a new address and that from now on the agent should go there if the agent wanted more drugs.   The agent left.   Minutes later the defendants were arrested.   The $50 that the agent had given Vidal was found on De LaCruz.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agents subsequently searched an apartment at Rand Street in Central Falls, Rhode Island.   This apartment was leased to Ovando;  and she and De LaCruz had been at the apartment (and under surveillance) on August 21 when Vidal telephoned him to arrange the delivery.   This search revealed scales, plastic bags and other drug-trade paraphernalia and also evidence indicating that De LaCruz also occupied or used the apartment.   In an adjoining basement, agents found a stash of 73.8 grams of crack and $3900 in cash--including $60 of the $100 in marked bills the agent had given Vidal during the first buy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing De LaCruz insisted that he and Vidal were equal partners and that Vidal also had access to the drugs and money at Ovando's apartment.   In fact Vidal's car was registered at that address.   But the district court concluded that De LaCruz was \"in charge,\" finding that De LaCruz stored the drugs in the Rand Street apartment he shared with Ovando and supplied them to Vidal, who merely arranged the sales.   Later in the hearing, the district court said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If he wasn't the leader I don't know who was.   This is a three person operation and he was in charge.   It was his operation.   What more can you do with it?   I can't, I've wrestled with it and I can't.   I'd like to give him every opportunity I can to go back to the Dominican Republic and die with his relatives.   But he's going to have to die in a federal penitentiary, that's what it comes to.   And this is costly.   This is costly to the United States government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p>............................................................</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p>....................</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p>* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that's the way it works.   I don't have the discretion to just throw away the guidelines or throw away Congress' mandatory minimum sentences and so I have to apply them....  I have no choice, I have to apply the mandatory minimum which is 120 months in prison.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably, the district court could have come out the other way.   The probation officer recommended applying the safety valve provision, and the prosecutor expressed some reservation at sentencing about calling De LaCruz the \"leader.\"   But the final determination is for the district court, and it was rational to conclude that De LaCruz--who held the drugs and money--was in charge.   De LaCruz's equal-partners gloss is plausible but, on appeal, he bears the burden to show clear error and cannot prevail simply by putting forth a reasonable alternative interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This would resolve matters entirely but for the district court's brief comment, \"[i]f he wasn't the leader I don't know who was.\"   In the abstract, this might imply a belief that someone is necessarily the leader in a group sale.   Such a belief would be error, since equal partners cannot be deemed leaders unless one or both controlled others.   See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.1;  United States v. Frankenhauser, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">154266</span></span>, at * 11 (1st Cir.  Apr. 9, 1996).   We think it far more likely that the comment was merely a way of emphasizing the court's view that De LaCruz was in fact the leader.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De LaCruz may share this latter view because he does not raise this issue on appeal and our review is accordingly limited to \"plain error.\"  United States v. Olano, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></a></span>, 1777-79 (1993).   It may be doubtful that an ambiguous statement could qualify as plain error although we might still be entitled to seek clarification.   But relief under Olano still requires a miscarriage of justice or the like.  113 S.Ct. at 1779.   For a reason not mentioned by either the district court or the government, such a conclusion would be hard to reach in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite De LaCruz' attempt to exculpate Ovando, her own role in the August 24 sale indicates that she played a minor role in the transaction.
