Borschow claims\r\n\nthat  Becton Dickinson violated  the Puerto Rico  Dealers Act, 10\r\n\nL.P.R.A.    278,  also commonly  known as  \"Law 75,\"  by granting\r\n\nadditional  distributorships  in   violation  of  its   allegedly\r\n\nexclusive    Distributorship    Agreement.1       Although    the\r\n\nDistributorship  Agreement  contained  a   clear  non-exclusivity\r\n\nprovision  and  integration clause,  Borschow  contends  that the\r\n\ndistrict court erred under Puerto Rico's parol evidence rule when\r\n\nit  excluded an  unsigned  written memorandum  sent prior  to the\r\n\nsigning of the  agreement as evidence  that the parties  actually\r\n\nintended the distributorship to be exclusive.  \r\n\n          Borschow also  claims that Becton Dickinson  engaged in\r\n\nan  unlawful tying arrangement in  violation of Section  1 of the\r\n\nSherman  Act,  15 U.S.C.    1,  by  threatening to  discontinue a\r\n\nsupply  of a  line of  its products  (the tying  products) unless\r\n\nBorschow  also carried  its syringe line  (the tied  product) and\r\n\ndropped that of a competitor.  \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1   The additional  distributorships were granted  to Defendants-\r\nAppellees  Cesar Castillo, Inc.  and UMECO,  Inc., which  filed a\r\nseparate brief.   At oral argument,  Becton Dickinson argued  for\r\nthe Appellees as a group.   Where we refer to Becton Dickinson in\r\nthe course  of this opinion, we  mean our statements to  apply to\r\nAppellees  as   a   group  except   where  otherwise   indicated.\r\nSimilarly, to avoid confusion where referring to the testimony of\r\nJonathan  Borschow, Borschow's president, we will refer to him as\r\nMr. Borschow and to the company simply as Borschow.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n          The district court granted summary judgment for Becton\r\n\nDickinson on both claims.

Co.,  950 F.2d 816,  822 (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1991),  cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985 (1992), we treat the following\r                              \r\n\nfacts  as controlling,  noting,  however,  that Bectin  Dickinson\r\n\ndisputes many aspects of this account.\r\n\n          A major  supplier of  medical products in  Puerto Rico,\r\n\nBorschow contracted with Parke Davis &amp; Company (\"Parke Davis\") on\r\n\nMay 1, 1985 to distribute a line of medical and surgical products\r\n\nmanufactured  by  its  subsidiary,  Deseret  Medical,  Inc.  (the\r\n\n\"Deseret Line\").  In  mid-1986, Becton Dickinson acquired Deseret\r\n\nand  assumed  Parke  Davis' obligations  under  the  distribution\r\n\nagreement as  an assignee.   This dispute turns in  large part on\r\n\nthe content of that agreement.\r\n\n          The  distribution  agreement executed  by  Borschow and\r\n\nParke  Davis [\"Distribution Agreement\"],  includes two provisions\r\n\nof  interest here.  First, it provides that \"Company [i.e., Parke\r\n\nDavis]  hereby  appoints  Distributor [i.e.,  Borschow]  and  the\r\n\nDistributor   hereby  accepts   appointment,  as   the  Company's\r\n\nnonexclusive independent distributor of the  Products for Regular\r                      \r\n\nBusiness  in the Territory [i.e., Puerto Rico] during the term of\r\n\nthis  Agreement.\"    Distribution  Agreement,     2.1.2 (emphasis\r\n\n                               -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nadded).  Second, the  contract included the following integration\r\n\nclause:\r\n\n          Integration:   The terms and  provisions contained\r                               \r\n          in   this   Agreement,  including   all  Schedules\r\n          attached hereto and  Company's Standard Terms  and\r\n          Conditions of  Sale in effect, from  time to time,\r\n          constitute the  entire agreement and  is the final\r\n          expression  of intent between the Parties relating\r\n          to  the subject  matter hereof and  supersede, all\r\n          previous      communications,     representations,\r\n          agreements,  and  understandings,  either oral  or\r\n          written,  between the Parties  with respect to the\r\n          subject  matter   thereof.     No   agreement   or\r\n          understanding varying or extending  this Agreement\r\n          will be binding upon either Party hereto unless in\r\n          writing,  wherein  this Agreement  is specifically\r\n          referred  to,  and   signed  by  duly   authorized\r\n          officers  or  representatives  of  the  respective\r\n          Parties. \r\n\nId.    9.10.  Borschow's president,  Jonathan Borschow, initially\r             \r\n\nrefused  to sign  any  contract that  included a  non-exclusivity\r\n\nprovision.   However, in  negotiations prior to  execution of the\r\n\nDistribution  Agreement,  Robert  Vallance,   Deseret's  Regional\r\n\nDirector for Canada/Latin America,  assured Mr. Borschow that his\r\n\ndistributorship would  be exclusive.  Vallance  promised him that\r\n\nhe would receive a letter from Parke Davis promising exclusivity.\r\n\nWhen  that letter  was not  forthcoming, Mr.  Borschow telephoned\r\n\nVallance  and  inquired  about  the delay.    Vallance  told  Mr.\r\n\nBorschow  that  the  people  in \"Morris  Plains,\"  the  corporate\r\n\nheadquarters of Warner Lambert, Parke Davis' parent company, were\r\n\nconsidering the matter.\r\n\n          After that conversation, Mr. Borschow  received a draft\r\n\nof the Distribution Agreement, which included the non-exclusivity\r\n\nterm.   He  again  objected to  Vallance  but was  told  that the\r\n\n                               -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\n\"contract cannot, it  will not be changed.   The people in Morris\r\n\nPlains  will not  countenance it.\"   However,  Vallance reassured\r\n\nMr. Borschow that he would send a document that would outline the\r\n\n\"true\" basis for their business relationship, including a promise\r\n\nthat Borschow's distributorship would be exclusive.  \r\n\n          Within a matter of  days, Mr. Borschow received a  two-\r\n\npage undated and  unsigned outline.   The outline specifies  that\r\n\none  of the supplier's obligations is to \"sell exclusively to the\r\n\nDISTRIBUTOR  and refrain  from selling  to other  DISTRIBUTORS or\r\n\nclients in the  territory while the AGREEMENT is in effect.\"  The\r\n\noutline neither  explicitly mentions Mr. Borschow  or Parke Davis\r\n\nnor  refers  to  the  May  1  Distribution  Agreement.   Borschow\r\n\ntestified   that   he   executed   the   Distribution   Agreement\r\n\napproximately two weeks after he received the outline.2 \r\n\n          From the  execution of the  agreement in 1985  to 1986,\r\n\nBorschow  remained  Parke  Davis' exclusive  distributor  of  the\r\n\nDeseret line.   After Becton Dickinson's acquisition of   Deseret\r\n\nin  mid-1986, no  changes  were made  in  the relationship  until\r\n\nNovember 1989, when Becton Dickinson granted distributorships  to\r\n\nUMECO, Inc.  and C sar Castillo, Inc.\r\n\n          Moreover, according to Borschow and his salespeople, at\r\n\napproximately the same time that the additional distributors were\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2     At  Mr.  Borschow's  deposition,  the  parties  marked  the\r\nDistribution Agreement as BDX-1 and the undated outline as BDX-3,\r\nand throughout its  brief Appellant  refers to  the documents  by\r\nthose numbers.  To avoid confusion, however, the Court will refer\r\nto BDX-1 and BDX-3 as the Distribution Agreement and the Outline,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\n                               -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nestablished  in November  1989,  Becton  Dickinson demanded  that\r\n\nBorschow cease  distributing the Monoject Syringe  &amp; Needle Line,\r\n\nmade by  a Becton Dickinson  competitor, and  begin carrying  the\r\n\nBecton Dickinson syringe line.   Becton Dickinson also threatened\r\n\nthat if  Borschow did not meet this demand, it would no longer be\r\n\nsupplied with  the Deseret line.   However, Becton  Dickinson did\r\n\nnot carry through on  this threat.  Although Borschow  refused to\r\n\ndrop  Monoject,  Becton  Dickinson continued  to  supply  Deseret\r\n\nproducts to Borschow.\r\n\n          B. Proceedings Below\r                    B. Proceedings Below\r\n\n          Borschow  brought an action  in federal  district court\r\n\nfor the District  of Puerto  Rico on February  6, 1990,  alleging\r\n\nthat  Becton  Dickinson's termination  of  Borschow's \"exclusive\"\r\n\ndistributorship  violated Law  75  and  that  Becton  Dickinson's\r\n\nthreat to tie the  Deseret line to its syringe  line violated the\r\n\nSherman Act.   Borschow also alleged  a conspiracy with  Castillo\r\n\nand  UMECO in  restraint of  trade and  attempted monopolization.\r\n\nFederal  jurisdiction  was invoked  on  the  basis of  a  federal\r\n\nquestion and diversity of citizenship.\r\n\n          On September  24, 1990,  the  district court  permitted\r\n\ndiscovery limited to the threshold issue as to whether Borschow's\r\n\ndistributorship  was  exclusive.   On  January  15, 1991,  Becton\r\n\nDickinson moved for summary judgment, asserting that taking these\r\n\nfacts  in the light most favorable to Plaintiff,  Borschow cannot\r\n\nevade  the  effect of  its  written contract  providing  for non-\r\n\nexclusivity.  If Borschow's contract was non-exclusive, according\r\n\n                               -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nto Becton Dickinson,  the Law 75 claim fails as  a matter of law.\r\n\nIn  addition,  Becton  Dickinson  argued  that  the  outline  was\r\n\nextrinsic evidence of the  contracting parties' intent that could\r\n\nnot be considered  on summary judgment  because of Puerto  Rico's\r\n\nparol evidence rule.  \r\n\n          The  motion was  referred  to a  magistrate judge,  who\r\n\nissued a  report and  recommendation denying summary  judgment on\r\n\nthe  ground that  the extrinsic  evidence  raised issues  of fact\r\n\nregarding whether  the agreement  provided for exclusivity.   The\r\n\ndistrict  court  (Acosta, J.)  initially  adopted  the magistrate\r\n\njudge's  recommendation  without comment,  but  on  a motion  for\r\n\nreconsideration, the court (Casellas, J.) granted partial summary\r\n\njudgment  for  Becton Dickinson.3    The court  held  that Puerto\r\n\nRico's parol  evidence rule  barred consideration of  the outline\r\n\nand that the contract  unambiguously provided for a non-exclusive\r\n\ndistributorship.

In\r                              \r\n\na subsequent  order, the  court granted partial  summary judgment\r\n\nfor  Becton  Dickinson on  the antitrust  claims  due to  lack of\r\n\nevidence of  tying,  anticompetitive  injury  or  conspiracy  and\r\n\ndismissed the pendent state law claims.

Crediting\r\n\nMr. Borschow's  testimony  that  he  received  the  outline  from\r\n\nVallance promising  an exclusive  distributorship, as we  must on\r\n\nsummary judgment,  we hold  that the integration  clause rendered\r\n\ninoperative  any  such side-agreement,  and  we  are barred  from\r\n\nconsidering the extrinsic evidence by Rule 69(B).\r\n\n          Borschow attempts  to evade the effect  of this settled\r\n\nprecedent  by   arguing  that  the   entire  agreement,  properly\r\n\n                               -13-\r                                          13\r\r\n\nconstrued,  includes  both  the Distribution  Agreement  and  the\r\n\nOutline.

To some\r\n\nextent, Borschow's  reliance on  this Civil Code  principle finds\r\n\nsome support  in Puerto Rico case  law.

Yet to\r\n          consider extrinsic evidence at all, the court\r\n\n                               -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          must  first find  the relevant  terms of  the\r\n          agreement  unclear.    That  requirement  not\r\n          being met, the district court  correctly went\r\n          no further.\r\n\n48  F.3d at 69 (excluding extrinsic evidence of exclusive dealing\r\n\ncondition and  of \"actual practice\" of  parties); accord Hopgood,\r                                                                          \r\n\n839 F.

Because Borschow's  distributorship was\r\n\nnon-exclusive as  a matter  of law,  the district  court properly\r\n\ngranted summary judgment for Appellees on the Law 75 claim.4 \r\n\n          C.

We agree.   \r\n\n          \"Section 1 of the Sherman  Act prohibits a seller  from\r\n\n'tying'  the sale  of  one product  to the  purchase of  a second\r\n\nproduct if the seller thereby avoids competition on the merits of\r\n\nthe 'tied' product.  See 15 U.S.C.   1 ('Every contract . .  . in\r                                  \r\n\nrestraint  of  trade  or  commerce  .  .  .  is  declared  to  be\r\n\nillegal.')\"  Data General Corp. v.

In\r\naddition,  Borschow conceded  at oral  argument that  our holding\r\nthat the Distribution Agreement was non-exclusive would foreclose\r\nrelief on all of its antitrust claims except its tying claim.  \r\n\n6   Borschow  does not articulate  a \"rule  of reason\"  theory of\r\ntying  liability.

Although Borschow has\r\n\nadduced evidence  of various threats  by Becton Dickinson,  it is\r\n\nundisputed that these threats were not carried out.  Permitted to\r\n\ncarry both the Deseret  line and the Monoject line,  Borschow was\r\n\nnever injured  by the threat.

(the \"Deseret Line\").  In mid-1986, Becton Dickinson acquired Deseret and assumed Parke Davis' obligations under the distribution agreement as an assignee.  This dispute turns in large part on the content of that agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distribution agreement executed by Borschow and Parke Davis [\"Distribution Agreement\"], includes two provisions of interest here.  First, it provides that \"Company [i.e., Parke Davis] hereby appoints Distributor [i.e., Borschow] and the Distributor hereby accepts appointment, as the Company's nonexclusive independent distributor of the Products for Regular Business in the Territory [i.e., Puerto Rico] during the term of this Agreement.\"   Distribution Agreement, &#167; 2.1.2 (emphasis added).

Borschow's president, Jonathan Borschow, initially refused to sign any contract that included a non-exclusivity provision.  However, in negotiations prior to execution of the Distribution Agreement, Robert Vallance, Deseret's Regional Director for Canada/Latin America, assured Mr. Borschow that his distributorship would be exclusive.  Vallance promised him that he would receive a letter from Parke Davis promising exclusivity.  When that letter was not forthcoming, Mr. Borschow telephoned Vallance and inquired about the delay.  Vallance told Mr. Borschow that the people in \"Morris Plains,\" the corporate headquarters of Warner Lambert, Parke Davis' parent company, were considering the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After that conversation, Mr. Borschow received a draft of the Distribution Agreement, which included the non-exclusivity term.  He again objected to Vallance but was told that the \"contract cannot, it will not be changed.  The people in Morris Plains will not countenance it.\"   However, Vallance reassured Mr. Borschow that he would send a document that would outline the \"true\" basis for their business relationship, including a promise that Borschow's distributorship would be exclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a matter of days, Mr. Borschow received a two-page undated and unsigned outline.  The outline specifies that one of the supplier's obligations is to \"sell exclusively to the DISTRIBUTOR and refrain from selling to other DISTRIBUTORS or clients in the territory while the AGREEMENT is in effect.\"   The outline neither explicitly mentions Mr. Borschow or Parke Davis nor refers to the May 1 Distribution Agreement.  Borschow testified that he executed the Distribution Agreement approximately two weeks after he received the outline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the execution of the agreement in 1985 to 1986, Borschow remained Parke Davis' exclusive distributor of the Deseret line.  After Becton Dickinson's acquisition of Deseret in mid-1986, no changes were made in the relationship until November 1989, when Becton Dickinson granted distributorships to UMECO, Inc. and Cesar Castillo, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, according to Borschow and his salespeople, at approximately the same time that the additional distributors were established in November 1989, Becton Dickinson demanded that Borschow cease distributing the Monoject Syringe &amp; Needle Line, made by a Becton Dickinson competitor, and begin carrying the Becton Dickinson syringe line.  Becton Dickinson also threatened that if Borschow did not meet this demand, it would no longer be supplied with the Deseret line.  However, Becton Dickinson did not carry through on this threat.  Although Borschow refused to drop Monoject, Becton Dickinson continued to supply Deseret products to Borschow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borschow brought an action in federal district court for the District of Puerto Rico on February 6, 1990, alleging that Becton Dickinson's termination of Borschow's \"exclusive\" distributorship violated Law 75 and that Becton Dickinson's threat to tie the Deseret line to its syringe line violated the Sherman Act.  Borschow also alleged a conspiracy with Castillo and UMECO in restraint of trade and attempted monopolization.  Federal jurisdiction was invoked on the basis of a federal question and diversity of citizenship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 1990, the district court permitted discovery limited to the threshold issue as to whether Borschow's distributorship was exclusive.  On January 15, 1991, Becton Dickinson moved for summary judgment, asserting that taking these facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Borschow cannot evade the effect of its written contract providing for non-exclusivity.  If Borschow's contract was non-exclusive, according to Becton Dickinson, the Law 75 claim fails as a matter of law.  In addition, Becton Dickinson argued that the outline was extrinsic evidence of the contracting parties' intent that could not be considered on summary judgment because of Puerto Rico's parol evidence rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who issued a report and recommendation denying summary judgment on the ground that the extrinsic evidence raised issues of fact regarding whether the agreement provided for exclusivity.  The district court (Acosta, J.) initially adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation without comment, but on a motion for reconsideration, the court (Casellas, J.) granted partial summary judgment for Becton Dickinson.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The court held that Puerto Rico's parol evidence rule barred consideration of the outline and that the contract unambiguously provided for a non-exclusive distributorship.  Borschow Hosp. &amp; Medical Supplies, Inc. v. Cesar Castillo, Inc., 882 F.Supp. 236, 239-40 (D.P.R.1995).  In a subsequent order, the court granted partial summary judgment for Becton Dickinson on the antitrust claims due to lack of evidence of tying, anticompetitive injury or conspiracy and dismissed the pendent state law claims.  Borschow timely appealed the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

The standard is well-rehearsed and familiar.  \"Summary judgment is appropriate when 'the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.' \"  Barbour v.

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2514, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).  \"There must be 'sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving party for a jury to return a verdict for that party.  If the evidence is merely colorable or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.' \"  Rogers, 902 F.2d at 143 (quoting Anderson, 477 U.S. at 249-50, 106 S.Ct. at 2511) (citations and footnote in Anderson omitted).  We \"view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\"  Barbour, 63 F.3d at 36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Law 75 Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The legislature of Puerto Rico enacted Law 75 to protect distributors, agents, concessionaires and representatives of a product or service in Puerto Rico....  [M]ore specifically, Law 75 was intended to protect dealers who built up a market, from suppliers who wish to appropriate their established clientele.\"  Medina &amp; Medina v. Country Pride Foods, Ltd., 825 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir.1987).  \"Law 75 provides that, notwithstanding the existence in a dealer's contract of a clause reserving to the parties the unilateral right to terminate the existing relationship, no principal or grantor may directly or indirectly perform any act detrimental to the established relationship or refuse to renew said contract on its normal expiration, except for just cause.\"   General Office Prods.  Corp. v. Gussco Mfg. Inc., 666 F.Supp. 328, 328 (D.P.R.1987) (citing 10 L.P.R.A. &#167; 278(a)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Law 75 has proved fertile ground for litigation, and we recently have had occasion to consider its application to circumstances analogous to those presented here.  Although \"non-exclusive distributors are entitled to protection under Law 75,\" Vulcan Tools of Puerto Rico v. Makita U.S.A., Inc., 23 F.3d 564, 569 (1st Cir.1994), \"[i]t is equally true ... that Law 75 does not operate to convert non-exclusive distribution contracts into exclusive distribution contracts.\"  Id. (citing Gussco, 666 F.Supp. at 331).   As we said in Vulcan Tools, \"the 'established relationship' between dealer and principal is bounded by the distribution agreement, and therefore the Act only protects against detriments to contractually acquired rights.\"  Id. at 569.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case turns on whether Borschow and Parke Davis (now Becton Dickinson) contracted for a non-exclusive or exclusive distributorship.  If the former, Borschow cannot prevail on its claim that Law 75 prohibits Becton Dickinson from supplying Deseret medical products to other distributors.  See Vulcan Tools, 23 F.3d at 569 (Law 75 did not prevent supplier from establishing additional distributorships in Puerto Rico where non-exclusive distributor was already operating even if existing distributor suffered economic harm as result);  Nike Int'l Ltd. v. Athletic Sales, Inc., 689 F.Supp. 1235, 1238-39 (D.P.R.1988) (where distributorship contract between Nike and distributor provided for notice of renewal from distributor and distributor failed to provide such notice, Law 75 did not bar termination of distributorship contract).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a civil law jurisdiction, Puerto Rico eschews common law principles of contract interpretation in favor of its own civil code derived from Spanish law.  See Guevara v. Dorsey Labs., Div. of Sandoz, Inc., 845 F.2d 364, 366 (1st Cir.1988) (\"The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has made clear that the common law of the United States is not controlling when filling gaps in the civil law system.\");  Gussco, 666 F.Supp. at 332.   Thus, we turn to Civil Code Article 1233, which \"determines the manner in which courts should interpret contracts under dispute as to the meaning of their terms.\"  Hopgood v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, 839 F.Supp. 98, 104 (D.P.R.1993), aff'd, 36 F.3d 1089 (1st Cir.1994) (table).

Brown Boveri Corp., 114 P.R. Dec. 64, 72 (1983) (official translation), several courts have interpreted Article 1233 to be \"strict in its mandate that courts should enforce the literal sense of a written contract, unless the words are somehow contrary to the intent of the parties.\"  Hopgood, 839 F.Supp. at 104;  see also Vulcan Tools, 23 F.3d at 567 (\"When an agreement leaves no doubt as to the intention of the parties, a court should not look beyond the literal terms of the contract.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This interpretation of Article 1233 is complemented by Puerto Rico's parol evidence rule, P.R.Laws Ann. tit. 32, App.  IV, R. 69(B) (1983) (\"Rule 69(B)\"), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p>When in an oral or written agreement, either public or private, all the terms and conditions constituting the true and final intention of the parties have been included, such agreement shall be deemed as complete, and therefore, there can be between the parties, or successors in interest, no evidence extrinsic to the contents of the same, except in the following cases:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>(1) Where a mistake or imperfection of the agreement is put in issue by the pleadings;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>(2) Where the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p>This rule does not exclude other evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was made or to which it is related such as the situation of the subject matter of the instrument or that of the parties, or to establish illegality or fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have interpreted this rule in tandem with Article 1233 to require courts \"to ignore [parol] evidence 'when the agreement ... is clear and unambiguous.' \"  Mercado-Garca v. Ponce Fed.  Bank, 979 F.2d 890, 894 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting Catullo, 834 F.2d at 1079).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recently, we have held that these provisions bar consideration of extrinsic evidence to vary the express, clear, and unambiguous terms of a contract.  See Executive Leasing Corp., 48 F.3d at 69-70 (refusing to consider parol evidence regarding implied loan term barring leasing company from dealing with other banks where contract did not include restriction but did include clear integration clause);  Vulcan Tools, 23 F.3d at 564-68 (where contractual term providing for \"non-exclusive\" distributorship was clear and unambiguous, there was no need to consider extrinsic evidence of promise to limit number of distributors even absent contractual integration clause);  see also Hopgood, 839 F.Supp. at 103-05 (holding that term \"indefinite\" used in employment contract clearly signified employment at will and refusing to consider parol evidence of implied guarantee of three-year minimum employment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This line of cases effectively parries the main thrust of Borschow's appeal.  The Distribution Agreement clearly and unambiguously gives Borschow a \"non-exclusive\" distributorship.  The integration clause, specifying that the terms and provisions of this Distribution Agreement constitute the \"entire agreement\" and \"the final expression of intent,\" nullifies any other oral or written understandings reached between the parties.  Crediting Mr. Borschow's testimony that he received the outline from Vallance promising an exclusive distributorship, as we must on summary judgment, we hold that the integration clause rendered inoperative any such side-agreement, and we are barred from considering the extrinsic evidence by Rule 69(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borschow attempts to evade the effect of this settled precedent by arguing that the entire agreement, properly construed, includes both the Distribution Agreement and the Outline.  Because the documents contain mutually inconsistent terms, Borschow contends that Article 1233 of Puerto Rico's Civil Code permits liberal consideration of extrinsic evidence as to the parties' intent to resolve contractual ambiguity.  To some extent, Borschow's reliance on this Civil Code principle finds some support in Puerto Rico case law.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>The intention of the parties is the essential test provided in the Civil Code to fix the scope of contractual obligations.  This test of intention is so essential in the interpretation of contracts that the Code proclaims its supremacy in providing that the evident intention of the parties shall prevail over the words, even where the latter would appear contrary to the intention....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Merle v.

Nor is a claim of equitable estoppel properly before us.  Borschow contends for the first time on appeal that Becton Dickinson should be estopped from denying the existence of an exclusive contract because of the conduct of its agent, Vallance.

Although the amended verified complaint contains conclusory allegations that Becton Dickinson's conduct generally had an adverse effect on competition, there is no evidence in the record to support the allegation that the threats of tying had such an adverse impact, or to provide a basis for providing further discovery pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f).

(the \"Deseret Line\").  In mid-1986, Becton Dickinson acquired Deseret and assumed Parke Davis' obligations under the distribution agreement as an assignee.  This dispute turns in large part on the content of that agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The distribution agreement executed by Borschow and Parke Davis [\"Distribution Agreement\"], includes two provisions of interest here.  First, it provides that \"Company [i.e., Parke Davis] hereby appoints Distributor [i.e., Borschow] and the Distributor hereby accepts appointment, as the Company's nonexclusive independent distributor of the Products for Regular Business in the Territory [i.e., Puerto Rico] during the term of this Agreement.\"   Distribution Agreement, &#167; 2.1.2 (emphasis added).  Second, the contract included the following integration clause:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>Integration:  The terms and provisions contained in this Agreement, including all Schedules attached hereto and Company's Standard Terms and Conditions of Sale in effect, from time to time, constitute the entire agreement and is the final expression of intent between the Parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede, all previous communications, representations, agreements, and understandings, either oral or written, between the Parties with respect to the subject matter thereof.  No agreement or understanding varying or extending this Agreement will be binding upon either Party hereto unless in writing, wherein this Agreement is specifically referred to, and signed by duly authorized officers or representatives of the respective Parties.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. &#167; 9.10.  Borschow's president, Jonathan Borschow, initially refused to sign any contract that included a non-exclusivity provision.  However, in negotiations prior to execution of the Distribution Agreement, Robert Vallance, Deseret's Regional Director for Canada/Latin America, assured Mr. Borschow that his distributorship would be exclusive.  Vallance promised him that he would receive a letter from Parke Davis promising exclusivity.  When that letter was not forthcoming, Mr. Borschow telephoned Vallance and inquired about the delay.  Vallance told Mr. Borschow that the people in \"Morris Plains,\" the corporate headquarters of Warner Lambert, Parke Davis' parent company, were considering the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After that conversation, Mr. Borschow received a draft of the Distribution Agreement, which included the non-exclusivity term.  He again objected to Vallance but was told that the \"contract cannot, it will not be changed.  The people in Morris Plains will not countenance it.\"   However, Vallance reassured Mr. Borschow that he would send a document that would outline the \"true\" basis for their business relationship, including a promise that Borschow's distributorship would be exclusive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a matter of days, Mr. Borschow received a two-page undated and unsigned outline.  The outline specifies that one of the supplier's obligations is to \"sell exclusively to the DISTRIBUTOR and refrain from selling to other DISTRIBUTORS or clients in the territory while the AGREEMENT is in effect.\"   The outline neither explicitly mentions Mr. Borschow or Parke Davis nor refers to the May 1 Distribution Agreement.  Borschow testified that he executed the Distribution Agreement approximately two weeks after he received the outline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the execution of the agreement in 1985 to 1986, Borschow remained Parke Davis' exclusive distributor of the Deseret line.  After Becton Dickinson's acquisition of Deseret in mid-1986, no changes were made in the relationship until November 1989, when Becton Dickinson granted distributorships to UMECO, Inc. and Cesar Castillo, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, according to Borschow and his salespeople, at approximately the same time that the additional distributors were established in November 1989, Becton Dickinson demanded that Borschow cease distributing the Monoject Syringe &amp; Needle Line, made by a Becton Dickinson competitor, and begin carrying the Becton Dickinson syringe line.  Becton Dickinson also threatened that if Borschow did not meet this demand, it would no longer be supplied with the Deseret line.  However, Becton Dickinson did not carry through on this threat.  Although Borschow refused to drop Monoject, Becton Dickinson continued to supply Deseret products to Borschow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Proceedings Below</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borschow brought an action in federal district court for the District of Puerto Rico on February 6, 1990, alleging that Becton Dickinson's termination of Borschow's \"exclusive\" distributorship violated Law 75 and that Becton Dickinson's threat to tie the Deseret line to its syringe line violated the Sherman Act.  Borschow also alleged a conspiracy with Castillo and UMECO in restraint of trade and attempted monopolization.  Federal jurisdiction was invoked on the basis of a federal question and diversity of citizenship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 24, 1990, the district court permitted discovery limited to the threshold issue as to whether Borschow's distributorship was exclusive.  On January 15, 1991, Becton Dickinson moved for summary judgment, asserting that taking these facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiff, Borschow cannot evade the effect of its written contract providing for non-exclusivity.  If Borschow's contract was non-exclusive, according to Becton Dickinson, the Law 75 claim fails as a matter of law.  In addition, Becton Dickinson argued that the outline was extrinsic evidence of the contracting parties' intent that could not be considered on summary judgment because of Puerto Rico's parol evidence rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion was referred to a magistrate judge, who issued a report and recommendation denying summary judgment on the ground that the extrinsic evidence raised issues of fact regarding whether the agreement provided for exclusivity.  The district court (Acosta, J.) initially adopted the magistrate judge's recommendation without comment, but on a motion for reconsideration, the court (Casellas, J.) granted partial summary judgment for Becton Dickinson.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The court held that Puerto Rico's parol evidence rule barred consideration of the outline and that the contract unambiguously provided for a non-exclusive distributorship.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></span>, 239-40 (D.P.R.1995).  In a subsequent order, the court granted partial summary judgment for Becton Dickinson on the antitrust claims due to lack of evidence of tying, anticompetitive injury or conspiracy and dismissed the pendent state law claims.  Borschow timely appealed the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

See Executive Leasing Corp., 48 F.3d at 69-70 (refusing to consider parol evidence regarding implied loan term barring leasing company from dealing with other banks where contract did not include restriction but did include clear integration clause);  Vulcan Tools, 23 F.3d at 564-68 (where contractual term providing for \"non-exclusive\" distributorship was clear and unambiguous, there was no need to consider extrinsic evidence of promise to limit number of distributors even absent contractual integration clause);  see also Hopgood, 839 F.Supp. at 103-05 (holding that term \"indefinite\" used in employment contract clearly signified employment at will and refusing to consider parol evidence of implied guarantee of three-year minimum employment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This line of cases effectively parries the main thrust of Borschow's appeal.  The Distribution Agreement clearly and unambiguously gives Borschow a \"non-exclusive\" distributorship.  The integration clause, specifying that the terms and provisions of this Distribution Agreement constitute the \"entire agreement\" and \"the final expression of intent,\" nullifies any other oral or written understandings reached between the parties.  Crediting Mr. Borschow's testimony that he received the outline from Vallance promising an exclusive distributorship, as we must on summary judgment, we hold that the integration clause rendered inoperative any such side-agreement, and we are barred from considering the extrinsic evidence by Rule 69(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Borschow attempts to evade the effect of this settled precedent by arguing that the entire agreement, properly construed, includes both the Distribution Agreement and the Outline.  Because the documents contain mutually inconsistent terms, Borschow contends that Article 1233 of Puerto Rico's Civil Code permits liberal consideration of extrinsic evidence as to the parties' intent to resolve contractual ambiguity.  To some extent, Borschow's reliance on this Civil Code principle finds some support in Puerto Rico case law.  The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has held that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p>The intention of the parties is the essential test provided in the Civil Code to fix the scope of contractual obligations.

They argue, however, that the written agreement was not in fact the entire agreement, and that we must consider extrinsic evidence of the parties' intent with respect to integration....
