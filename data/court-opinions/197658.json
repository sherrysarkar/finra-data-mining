Plaintiff-appellant William H.

We affirm.\r\n\n          Jones  complains that  the district court  erred in\r\n\nsetting  aside an  entry of  default  against Corporal  Frank\r\n\nCassidy.   We review a district court decision to set aside a\r\n\ndefault solely for abuse of discretion.  Leshore v. County of\r                                                                         \r\n\nWorcester,  945  F.2d  471,  472  (1st Cir.  1991).    Having\r                     \r\n\nreviewed the  record, we find  no abuse of discretion  in the\r\n\ninstant case.  We add that although  Jones lists the grant of\r\n\nsummary judgment in  favor of Cassidy as an  issue on appeal,\r\n\nhe nowhere makes  a developed argument that  summary judgment\r\n\nwas in  error.   Under the circumstances,  we deem  the issue\r\n\nwaived.  See King v. Town of  Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 970 (1st\r                                                 \r\n\nCir. 1997).   We add that even if  the issue were not waived,\r\n\nsummary judgment  would be proper  for the reasons  stated by\r\n\nthe district court.\r\n\n          Jones also contends  that the district  court erred\r\n\nin  granting  summary  judgment in  favor  of  Officer Darren\r\n\nBasoukas   Corporal   Stephen  Nolan,   and   Warden  Michael\r\n\nCunningham.  Having reviewed the grant of summary judgment de\r                                                                         \r\n\nnovo,  we find  no reversible  error.   See Dubois  v. United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates Dep't of Agric., 102  F.3d 1273, 1283 (1st Cir. 1996),\r                                  \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\ncert.  denied, 117 S. Ct. 2510 (1997) (setting forth standard\r                         \r\n\nof review).    \r\n\n          The claims against Basoukas and Nolan  stemmed from\r\n\nJones's   allegations  that  he  was  denied  insulin  and  a\r\n\nhypodermic needle on  May 24, 1994 when he signed  out of the\r\n\nhalfway  house  to go  to  work.    Both Basoukas  and  Nolan\r\n\nsubmitted affidavits denying any  personal involvement in the\r\n\nalleged  incident.  Jones failed to submit any countervailing\r\n\nevidence on this point, and, contrary  to his suggestion, the\r\n\nrecords submitted  by  defendants do  not  establish  Nolan's\r\n\npresence at the \"signing out.\"   His tardy unsworn allegation\r\n\nto  this   effect,  made   in  a   pretrial  statement,   was\r\n\ninsufficient to defeat  summary judgment.  See  DeNovellis v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nShalala,  124 F.3d  298,  305-06 (1st  Cir. 1997)  (\"The very\r                   \r\n\nmission of the  summary judgment procedure  is to pierce  the\r\n\npleadings and  to assess  the proof in  order to  see whether\r\n\nthere is a genuine need for trial.\" (quoting Fed.  R. Civ. P.\r\n\n56(e) advisory committee's note to 1963 amendment)).  F  o  r\r\n\nsimilar  reasons, we reject Jones's challenge to the grant of\r\n\nsummary judgment in  favor of Cunningham.   The claim against\r\n\nCunningham at issue on appeal stemmed from the alleged denial\r\n\nof special diet  meals at the halfway  house.  We agree  with\r\n\nthe district  court  that  Jones  failed to  show  \"[a]  link\r\n\nbetween  defendant  Cunningham's   alleged  indifference  and\r\n\n[Jones's] non-receipt of medical meals.\"  Jones introduced no\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\nevidence, by way of affidavit or otherwise, that he ever made\r\n\nany member of Calumet House  aware that his medical condition\r\n\nrequired a  special diet.  His tardy,  unsworn allegations to\r\n\nthe effect that staff knew he was on a special diet, made for\r\n\nthe first time in his pretrial statement, are not grounds for\r\n\nreversal.\r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                               \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
