Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                 Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n           Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n Monroe A. Laremore on brief pro se.\r\n Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney and Michael J.\r\nPineault, Assistant U.S. Attorney on brief for appellee.\r\n\nNovember 5, 1998\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Appellant Monroe A. Laremore filed a\r\ncomplaint in the Massachusetts federal district court seeking\r\nreview of the decision of appellee Commissioner of Social\r\nSecurity that appellant was not entitled to Social Security\r\ndisability benefits.  The district court granted the\r\nCommissioner's motion to dismiss on the ground that appellant\r\nhad not exhausted his administrative remedies.  Specifically,\r\nappellant had failed to request a hearing before an\r\nadministrative law judge.  Because appellant does not dispute\r\nthis and because his case does not come within any exceptions\r\nto the exhaustion requirement, the district court lacked\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction and properly dismissed the\r\ncomplaint.  See generally Doyle v. Secretary of Health and\r\nHuman Services, 848 F.2d 296 (1st Cir. 1988); Wilson v.\r\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, 671 F.2d 673 (1st Cir.\r\n1982).\r\n          The judgment of the district court is summarilyaffirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.  All pending motions are deniedas moot. \r\n\n                           -2-\n",
