Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n              Lynch and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nEdward E. Parson on brief for appellants.\r\nAngel R. De Corral and De Corral &amp; De Mier on brief for\r\nappellee Fernando J. Montilla; Ramonita Dieppa-Gonzlez, Pinto-Lugo\r\n&amp; Rivera, Jose R. Ortiz-Velez, and Latimer, Biaggi, Rachid &amp;\r\nGodreau on brief for appellee Pavia Hospital.\r\n\nMarch 30, 1999\r\n\nPer Curiam.  In this medical malpractice action under\r\nPuerto Rican law the district court entered summary judgment for\r\ndefendants on cross motions for summary judgment.  The district\r\ncourt found that the claim was barred by Puerto Rico's short one-\r\nyear statute of limitations for such actions.  This court reviews\r\nthe grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing all facts in the\r\nlight most favorable to the appellant.  See Lennon v. Rubin, 166\r\nF.3d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1999); McMahon v. Digital Equip. Corp., 162\r\nF.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1998).\r\nBarbara Arnold underwent a hysterectomy on September 27,\r\n1994.  The surgery was performed by Dr. Fernando Montilla at Pavia\r\nHospital in Puerto Rico.  Both Montilla and Pavia Hospital are\r\ndefendants in this case. In the aftermath of the hysterectomy,\r\nArnold suffered continuing discomfort, vomiting, stomach\r\ndistension, and nausea.  She alleges that she suffered an\r\nintestinal obstruction as a result of the surgery.  On October 5,\r\n1994, she underwent emergency surgery to remove this intestinal\r\nobstruction.  This second surgery was performed in St. Thomas,\r\nV.I., by Dr. Lawrence Rawlings.  \r\nIn support of her claim that her action is not time-\r\nbarred, Arnold argues that Dr. Montilla made statements to her in\r\nthe post-operative period, and beyond, that the hysterectomy\r\nsurgery was successful, that her pain was normal, and that she only\r\nhad an upset stomach.  Arnold also points out that the hysterectomy\r\nconsent form listed intestinal obstruction as a possible\r\ncomplication of the hysterectomy.  Arnold says that because of the\r\nconsent form she thought that intestinal obstruction was a normal\r\ncomplication and thus she was lulled into thinking there had been\r\nno negligence.  She claims that she first discovered in early\r\nJanuary 1995 that the intestinal obstruction resulted from Dr.\r\nMontilla's negligence during the surgery and that Dr. Montilla and\r\nthe Hospital were negligent in providing post-operative care when\r\nthey failed to diagnose the obstruction.  She attributes her\r\ninaction between October 1994 and January 1995 to the general pain\r\nand discomfort that she suffered in the aftermath of the two\r\nsurgeries.\r\nArnold filed her complaint in federal court on January 5,\r\n1996.  Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment; Arnold\r\nopposed and filed her own summary judgment motions against the two\r\ndefendants.  She appeals from the grant of the defendants' motion,\r\narguing that whether the running of the statute of limitations was\r\ntolled by Dr. Montilla's statements or by the consent form were\r\nissues for a jury to consider.  She also says the district court\r\nignored the tolling statute, 31 L.P.R.A.  5298.\r\n   Arnold's appellate arguments do not fairly characterize\r\nor address the actual basis for the district court's order granting\r\nsummary judgment.  The district court relied on excerpts from the\r\ndeposition testimony of Arnold and Dr. Rawlings.  Dr. Rawlings\r\ntestified about both the intestinal surgery that he performed and\r\nhis communications with Arnold around the time of the surgery. \r\nArnold testified in her deposition that Dr. Rawlings told her after\r\nher October 5 surgery that her intestinal blockage \"was caused by\r\na--some kind of a problem that happened with the surgery I just\r\nrecently had,\" and that Dr. Rawlings \"said the prior surgery that\r\nI had was the cause of--was the cause of the blockage.\"  Dr.\r\nRawlings in turn confirmed that his only communications with Arnold\r\nwere around the time of and immediately after her October 5, 1994\r\nsurgery. \r\n   We agree with the district court that no reasonable fact-\r\nfinder could find this action timely.  Regardless of Dr. Montilla's\r\nassurances, and any tolling effect which flowed from them, within\r\ndays of the initial surgery Arnold clearly had sufficient facts to\r\nput her on \"notice of [her] injury, plus notice of the person who\r\ncaused it.\"  Rodriguez-Suris v. Montesinos, 123 F. 3d 10, 13 (1st\r\nCir. 1997) (quoting Colon Prieto v. Geigel, 115 P.R. Dec. 232, 15\r\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 313, 330 (1984)); see also Villarini-Garcia v.\r\nHospital Del Maestro, Inc., 8 F. 3d 81, 85 (1st Cir. 1993)(noting\r\nthat Puerto Rico law regarding discovery of an injury \"focuses on\r\nwhether the plaintiff knew the facts that gave rise to the claim,\r\nnot their full legal implications\").  It was no longer reasonable\r\nfor her to rely on Dr. Montilla's assurances.  Since she did not\r\nbring suit within one year from the period of the intestinal\r\nsurgery that Dr. Rawlings performed, which, on her version of the\r\nfacts, was the latest period on which she had the requisite notice,\r\nher action was not timely.\r\n   Because the district court granted summary judgment on\r\nstatute of limitations grounds against Arnold, the court quite\r\nproperly did not reach Arnold's cross-motions for summary judgment. \r\n   Affirmed.  Costs to appellants.\n",
