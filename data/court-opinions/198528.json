Shane Devine, Senior District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Lynch, Circuit Judge,\r\n               Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n                 and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n   Edgar Sepulveda on brief pro se.\r\n   Paul M. Gagnon, United States Attorney, and Peter E. Papps,\r\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary Disposition for\r\nappellee.\r\n\nJune 16, 1999\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  Having carefully reviewed the decision\r\nbelow in light of the briefs and the record on appeal, we find\r\nno prejudicial error nor abuse of discretion in the district\r\ncourt's denial of appellant's motion to set aside an earlier\r\nfinal judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6).\r\n          Affirmed.  See Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
