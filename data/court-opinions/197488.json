The defendant-appellant, Awilda Garcia-\r\n\nVelilla, pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess and\r\n\ndistribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. SS 841(a)(1), 846.\r\n\nIn the plea agreement, the government agreed to dismiss 12\r\n\nother counts and to recommend a downward departure \"if the\r\n\n[defendant's] cooperation is deemed substantial.\" 18 U.S.C. S\r\n\n3553(e); U.S.S.G. S 5K1.1. The agreement purported to reserve\r\n\nto the prosecutor the exclusive right to decide whether\r\n\nsubstantial assistance had been provided.\r\n\n     Garcia-Velilla in turn agreed \"to provide all information\r\n\nknown to the defendant regarding any criminal activity\r\n\nincluding but not limited to the offenses described in the\r\n\npending indictment.\" The plea agreement further warned that if\r\n\nthe defendant failed in any way to fulfill completely her\r\n\nobligations under the agreement, the government would be freed\r\n\nfrom all obligations under the agreement. As an example of a\r\n\nbreach, the agreement referred to a defendant who \"knowingly\r\n\nwithholds evidence, or otherwise is not completely truthful\r\n\nwith the United States . . . .\"\r\n\n     Garcia-Velilla did provide considerable information to the\r\n\ngovernment but also, during her release on bail, twice tested\r\n\npositive for continued use of cocaine. The government took the\r\n\nposition that this impaired her usefulness as a witness and\r\n\nsaid that it would not move for a downward departure. In\r\n\naddition, Garcia-Velilla declined to tell the government who\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                         -2-\r\r\n\nhad supplied her with cocaine. The government asserted that\r\n\nthis was a further reason for its refusal to make a downward\r\n\ndeparture motion.\r\n\n     In connection with sentencing, the government persisted in\r\n\nits refusal and, despite a request by Garcia-Velilla, the\r\n\ndistrict court declined to compel the government to make such\r\n\na motion. It sentenced Garcia-Velilla to 70 months'\r\n\nimprisonment, a sentence determined without the benefit of a\r\n\ndownward departure for substantial assistance. The 70-month\r\n\nsentence was itself below the statutory minimum because Garcia-\r\n\nVelilla satisfied the requirements of 18 U.S.C. S 3553(f); but\r\n\na downward departure for substantial assistance would have\r\n\npermitted a sentence below the guideline range as well.\r\n\nU.S.S.G. S 5K1.1. Garcia Velilla now appeals claiming that the\r\n\ngovernment breached its plea agreement by failing to move for\r\n\nthe latter departure. We affirm.\r\n\n     The government is obliged to respect the terms of the plea\r\n\nagreement, United States v. Tilley, 964 F.2d 66, 70 (1st Cir.\r\n\n1992), including a conditional promise to recommend a downward\r\n\ndeparture. Whether this agreement could be regarded as\r\n\nestablishing such a promise is open to dispute since (as noted)\r\n\nthe agreement also purported to reserve this decision\r\n\nexclusively to the prosecutor. Also open to dispute is the\r\n\nstandard that would apply if the court did assess the\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                         -3-\r\r\n\ngovernment's refusal.  See generally United States v. Rexach,\r\n\n896 F.2d 710 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 969 (1990).\r\n\n     We need not definitively resolve these questions, because\r\n\nGarcia-Velilla admits that she refused to provide the names of\r\n\nthose who supplied her with cocaine while she was on bail.\r\n\nThis is a self-evident violation of an explicit requirement of\r\n\nthe plea agreement that she \"provide all information known to\r\n\n[her] regarding any criminal activity.\" The government in turn\r\n\nwas released from its obligations under the plea agreement,\r\n\nincluding any obligation to consider a downward departure\r\n\nmotion.\r\n\n     Garcia-Velilla says that the government got the benefit of\r\n\nconsiderable cooperation and has given nothing in return; and\r\n\nshe argues that her refusal to supply names of the persons who\r\n\nsupplied the cocaine should not be regarded as a sufficiently\r\n\nimportant breach to excuse compliance by the government. To\r\n\nthe first point the answer is that Garcia-Velilla knew from the\r\n\nagreement that she had to provide     all information about\r\n\ncriminal activity in order to receive    any benefit of the\r\n\nagreement. As to the claim that her breach was too minor to\r\n\ncount, the identity of suppliers of cocaine can hardly be\r\n\nregarded as trivial or unimportant, especially where the plea\r\n\nagreement itself made clear that all information had to be\r\n\nsupplied.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                         -4-\r\r\n\n     It thus becomes unnecessary to consider whether the\r\n\ngovernment could have declined to file a section 5K1.1 motion\r\n\nfor the limited reason that the defendant had, while on release\r\n\non bail, tested positively for cocaine and therefore apparently\r\n\nhad been in unlawful possession of that substance. Apparently\r\n\nthe plea agreement did not explicitly warn Garcia-Velilla that\r\n\nshe was obliged to refrain from any further criminal activity,\r\n\nnor did it say that further criminal activity would be regarded\r\n\nas failure to provide substantial assistance. Since this is a\r\n\nrecurring problem, it is unclear why the government fails to\r\n\nprovide such a warning, which would serve the interests of both\r\n\nthe defendant and the government.\r\n\n     In all events, the various questions posed by the lack of\r\n\nwarning need not be resolved in this case. Here, the defendant\r\n\ndid breach the plea agreement by refusing to provide\r\n\ninformation plainly required by the agreement. That is basis\r\n\nenough to affirm the district court. Solely because it may be\r\n\nuseful to alert prosecutors and defense counsel to the lack of\r\n\nwarning issue, this opinion will be published.\r\n\n     Affirmed.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                         -5-\r\n",
