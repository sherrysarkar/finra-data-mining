This appeal grows out of a\n\nlawsuit    by    Calvin    Keeler     against      Putnam       Investments,         Inc.\n\n(\"Putnam\")       and   others.        Keeler       charged       Putnam       with    age\n\ndiscrimination under state law, violation of the Family and\n\nMedical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2601-54 (1994 & Supp.\n\nII 1996), and other alleged wrongs.                  The district court gave\n\nsummary judgment for the defendants on all but one state-law\n\nclaim, which it remanded to state court, and Keeler has now\n\nappealed.       We begin with a brief outline of events, giving due\n\npreference to Keeler's version of the facts.\n\n            In 1987, Gavan Taylor, a senior executive at Putnam,\n\nrecommended      hiring    Keeler--then       57    years       of     age--to   manage\n\nPutnam's mainframe computer services functions.                        Keeler's title\n\nwas senior vice president.            During the period 1987-1993, Keeler\n\nwas highly rated in Putnam's regular evaluations.                             His base\n\nsalary    grew    to   just    over   $90,000      and     he    received      year-end\n\nbonuses ranging up to $33,100.                 However, as early as 1990,\n\nKeeler's    responsibilities          were    narrowed          to    focus    on    data\n\ncommunications and other new technology, and some of his staff\n\nwere reassigned.\n\n            In    August      1993,   Taylor       hired    a        new   senior    vice\n\npresident, Jack Chafin (age 49) to manage data communications.\n\nKeeler lost another chunk of his staff, and his duties were\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\flimited to computer-related planning, disaster recovery, data\n\nsecurity, and some administrative tasks.         Although he had once\n\nhad as many as 85 or more employees to supervise, his new duties\n\nafter August 1993 left him with only about five employees.\n\nHowever, Keeler remained a senior vice president with the same\n\nsalary.   At   the   end   of   the   year   Keeler   got   a   very   good\n\nperformance evaluation and a sizable $33,000 bonus but, unlike\n\nother senior vice presidents, he did not get any appreciable\n\nraise in salary.\n\n          In 1994, Taylor told Keeler that he would not receive\n\nhis usual large bonus at the end of the year because of his\n\nreduced duties.    In December 1994, Keeler was redesignated vice\n\npresident and lost the accouterments of a senior vice president\n\n(a large office, reserved parking).          His year-end bonus, now\n\nbased on a less favorable bonus plan, shrank to $7,300.           His job\n\nevaluation for the year (made in January 1995), although still\n\nadequate (3+), fell from the higher ranking (4) that he had\n\npreviously enjoyed (the maximum was 5).               In December 1994,\n\nconcerned about possible age discrimination, Keeler contacted a\n\nlawyer whom he knew had represented employment discrimination\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n          In 1995, Keeler was assigned to work on a significant\n\nproject to provide Internet access to Putnam employees; but,\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fafter some controversy about his handling of the project, he was\n\nremoved in mid-1995.     Disagreement also arose about Keeler's\n\nhandling of another matter involving Putnam's response to audit\n\ninquiries.    Chafin's    mid-year   assessment   graded   Keeler's\n\nperformance at a lower level (3), and in the fall Taylor told\n\nhim that his rating would be downgraded further (to 2).        When\n\nthe physical condition of Keeler's wife deteriorated in December\n\n1995, Keeler began to take periods of leave to care for her.\n\n         Keeler received no bonus for 1995 and, in 1996, another\n\ncontroversy arose about a delay in completing a local area\n\nnetwork security audit.    In March 1996, Chafin removed Keeler\n\nfrom supervision of disaster recovery and data security.         On\n\nMarch 20, 1996,   Keeler filed a complaint with the Massachusetts\n\nCommission   Against   Discrimination   (\"MCAD\"),   claiming    age\n\ndiscrimination.   By a letter of March 29, 1996, Keeler advised\n\nPutnam of the complaint and asked for a substantial change in\n\nposition or a substantial severance package.      After receipt of\n\nthe letter, Putnam, on April 2, 1996, escorted Keeler from the\n\npremises and placed him on paid leave.     Within a week, Putnam\n\nwithdrew the suspension, after Keeler's attorney warned Putnam\n\nthat its action represented retaliation.\n\n         During this period and continuing through the rest of\n\n1996, Putnam's wife was repeatedly hospitalized.      Keeler took\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fmore than 30 days away from work to care for her or as personal\n\nsick days, and the company always approved his absences.                 At the\n\nsame time, Keeler was given new projects.                However, in February\n\n1997, Keeler received a low performance rating (2+) and his\n\nreview noted that Keeler's \"[a]ttendance [was] unpredictable in\n\n1996 and part of 1995.\"                  Keeler asked Putnam to change the\n\nevaluation, provide him a performance improvement plan, and\n\nreinstate him as a senior vice president.                      Putnam declined.\n\nKeeler resigned on March 21, 1997.\n\n                  In May 1998, Keeler brought suit against Putnam in\n\nMassachusetts state court.1               The complaint set forth six claims\n\nunder Massachusetts law:             intentional age discrimination (count\n\nI) and disparate-impact age discrimination (count II), Mass.\n\nGen.       Laws    ch.   151B,   §   4   (1998);   retaliation   following   his\n\ncomplaint (count III), id. at §§ 4, 4(4); failure to investigate\n\nand        remedy        discrimination      (count     IV);     violation    of\n\nMassachusetts' Equal Rights Act because of age discrimination\n\n(count V), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93, § 103 (1998); and defamation\n\n(count VI).          A seventh, federal claim was for discrimination in\n\nviolation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (count VII).\n\n\n\n       1\n      Also named as defendants were Putnam's subsidiary, Putnam\nFiduciary Trust Co.; Putnam's corporate parent, Marsh & McLennan\nCo.; and Gavan Taylor and Jack Chafin. For simplicity, we refer\nto Putnam as the defendant.\n\n                                           -6-\n\f          Putnam removed the case to the district court and,\n\nafter   extensive   discovery   by   both   sides,   Putnam    moved   for\n\nsummary judgment on August 10, 1999.          For reasons more fully\n\nexplained below, the district court granted summary judgment to\n\nPutnam on all counts other than retaliation and remanded that\n\ncount to state court (because of difficult issues of state law\n\nas to exhaustion and the statute of limitations).              Keeler now\n\nappeals from the grant of summary judgment only as to the counts\n\ncharging intentional age discrimination, failure to investigate,\n\nand medical leave discrimination (counts I, IV, and VII).\n\n          Our review on a grant of summary judgment is de novo,\n\nLandrau-Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607,\n\n611 (1st Cir. 2000), and we begin with the sole federal claim.\n\nUnder the Family and Medical Leave Act, Keeler was entitled to\n\ntake \"a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month\n\nperiod\" to care for a spouse suffering from a \"serious health\n\ncondition,\" 29 U.S.C. § 2612(a)(1), and, more to the point,\n\nPutnam could not lawfully \"interfere with, restrain, or deny\"\n\nKeeler's exercise of this right, id. § 2615(a)(1).        Regulations,\n\nnot here challenged, prohibit an employer \"from discriminating\n\nagainst employees . . . who have used FMLA leave\" or from using\n\nsuch leave \"as a negative factor in employment actions, such as\n\nhiring,   promotions   or   disciplinary    actions.\"     29    C.F.R.   §\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f825.220(c) (2000); accord Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144\n\nF.3d 151, 159-60 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n             The   district    court    began   its    analysis    with    the\n\nframework adopted in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S.\n\n792, 802-04 (1973), which involved a Title VII claim that racial\n\ndiscrimination underlay a denial of employment.                The decision\n\nheld that, following a rather low threshold showing by the\n\nwould-be employee, an employer has an obligation to \"articulate\n\nsome legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the [applicant's]\n\nrejection,\" absent which discrimination may be presumed.              Id. at\n\n802.       With necessary adjustments to the threshold showing,\n\nMcDonnell      Douglas   has    been     adapted      to   other   kinds    of\n\ndiscrimination claims, including FMLA claims.2\n\n             When McDonnell Douglas applies, the employer normally\n\nseeks to proffer some colorable nondiscriminatory reason for the\n\nchallenged action.       The plaintiff may then say that the reason\n\nis pretext and the true reason is forbidden discrimination.\n\nMcDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804.          In that event, depending on\n\nthe record, there may or may not be legitimate issues for a\n\n\n\n       2\n     Hodgens, 144 F.3d at 160 (FMLA); see also Santiago-Ramos v.\nCentennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2000)\n(sex discrimination); DeNovellis v. Shalala, 124 F.3d 298, 308\n(1st Cir. 1997) (age discrimination included); Katz v. City\nMetal Co., 87 F.3d 26, 30 n.2 (1st Cir. 1996) (disability-based\ndiscrimination).\n\n                                       -8-\n\ffactfinder as to the true motive, causation and injury.    But the\n\nadverse presumption disappears, and the plaintiff retains the\n\nordinary burden of proving discrimination.      See Lawrence v.\n\nNorthrop Corp., 980 F.2d 66, 69-70 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n           By the time summary judgment was sought, Putnam had\n\nadvanced a host of nondiscriminatory reasons for its challenged\n\nactions.   Based on deposition and documentary evidence, Putnam\n\npainted a picture of Keeler failing in a series of important\n\nassignments from 1993 onward, of efforts by the company to\n\nprotect his pay and status while getting others to carry on the\n\nwork, and of Keeler failing to admit his weaknesses as a manager\n\nor to undertake to correct them.        Of course, most of the\n\nevidence came from Putnam's officials and could be challenged,\n\nbut    certainly     Putnam      colorably   \"explained\"     with\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons the adjustment in pay       status and\n\nevaluations it gave Keeler following his use of FMLA leave.\n\n           The district court did not decide the issue of motive.\n\nInstead, it concluded that Keeler had not satisfied a different\n\ncondition that the court said was necessary to \"a prima facie\n\ncase under the FMLA,\" namely, the requirement that Keeler have\n\nsuffered \"an adverse employment action\" arguably ascribable to\n\nhis use of FMLA leave.        It is not clear whether the court\n\nregarded this as part of the McDonnell Douglas threshold showing\n\n\n                                -9-\n\for as part of the showing that a plaintiff must make to avoid\n\nsummary judgment after the defendant's \"burden\" of explanation\n\nhas been met.3       In all events, Keeler does not dispute that to\n\navoid summary judgment he had to create a trialworthy issue that\n\nPutnam had taken adverse employment action against him that was\n\nmotivated at least in part by Keeler's use of protected leave.\n\n\n\n             In finding that no such trialworthy issue had been\n\ncreated, the district court took Keeler to be claiming that he\n\nsuffered     an   adverse   employment      action   after   he   took    leave\n\nbecause his absences were reflected in negative reports and\n\nevaluations of his performance in 1996.               The court said that\n\nnegative performance evaluations were not themselves adverse\n\nemployment actions, Sweeney v. West, 149 F.3d 550, 556 (7th Cir.\n\n1998);     and,    taking   Keeler     to    argue   further      that    these\n\nevaluations contributed to his \"constructive discharge,\" the\n\ncourt said that, as a matter of law, a reasonable person would\n\nnot   take   these    incidents   as    creating     \"intolerable        working\n\n\n\n      3\n     The courts have often used the term \"prima facie\" with\nrespect to both showings, compare Ward v. Massachusetts Health\nResearch Inst., Inc., 209 F.3d 29, 32-33 (1st Cir. 2000), with\nHodgens, 144 F.3d at 160-61, and the frequent failure to\nidentify which showing is at issue has bred substantial\nconfusion--which is enhanced because the two showings have some\ncommon elements while differing in other respects (or else\nMcDonnell Douglas would serve no function at all).\n\n                                     -10-\n\fconditions\" amounting to constructive discharge.                 We think that\n\nthe reasoning does not quite work but the grant of summary\n\njudgment was right.\n\n            Part of the confusion is due to the fact that Keeler,\n\nin   opposing    summary      judgment,      argued    emphatically      he    had\n\nsuffered a \"constructive discharge.\"             This was always a dubious\n\nargument    since    \"constructive         discharge\"       usually    describes\n\nharassment so severe and oppressive that staying on the job\n\nwhile seeking redress is intolerable.             Landrau-Romero, 212 F.3d\n\nat 613; Ramos v. Davis & Geck, Inc., 167 F.3d 727, 732-33 (1st\n\nCir.    1999).      Here,   none     of   Putnam's    actions   were    of    such\n\nmagnitude    that    Keeler    was    prevented      from   staying    on    while\n\nseeking remedies for any harm he had suffered.                  See Nunez-Soto\n\nv. Alvarado, 918 F.2d 1029, 1030-31 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n            We also agree with Sweeney, 149 F.3d at 556, that not\n\nevery comment about problems created by the use of leave can\n\nfairly be treated as an adverse employment action violating the\n\nFMLA.    An employee's use of leave, while fully legitimate, can\n\ncause serious problems for the employee's performance of his\n\ntasks and require an employer to implement changes in how jobs\n\nare assigned and who does what within the organization.                  What is\n\nprevented is adverse action against the employee for using the\n\nprotected leave.      See 29 C.F.R. § 825.220(c).             But in opposing\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fsummary judgment, Keeler did allege two different types of\n\nconcrete injury never addressed by the district court:\n\n           •that the loss of his remaining staff and\n           important functions in March 1996 was due in\n           part to displeasure at his use of FMLA leave\n           and, that while this motivation was not\n           expressed to him at the time (and he then\n           thought that age discrimination was the\n           reason), a private April 1996 memorandum\n           refers to absence problems; and\n\n           •that the absences, mentioned again in the\n           year-end evaluation of his 1996 performance,\n           resulted in his low \"2+\" rating which (he\n           says) was an understood threat of dismissal,\n           to which he yielded in order to retain\n           lifetime health benefits.\n\n           On appeal, Keeler's opening brief mentions neither of\n\nthe above injury claims in the context of his FMLA argument but,\n\nin   addition   to    repeating   the   constructive   discharge    claim,\n\noffers a new claim of injury, namely, that the low \"2+\" rating\n\nallegedly disqualified Keeler from eligibility for a bonus for\n\nhis 1996 work and that concern over absences may also explain\n\nthe failure to give him a bonus for 1995 work (even though the\n\ndownturn   in   his    wife's     health   that   triggered   his   taking\n\nsignificant FMLA leave did not occur until December 1995).\n\nKeeler refers to his        earlier district court allegations of\n\ninjury only briefly and in his reply brief in this court.\n\n           Certainly, it would have been better for the district\n\ncourt to have addressed the two specific injury claims Keeler\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fmade in opposing summary judgment.         But these claims are forfeit\n\non appeal because neither one is renewed in Keeler's opening\n\nbrief, which instead offers a new claim of injury not made in\n\nthe district court and now unavailable.          Wills v. Brown Univ.,\n\n184 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 1999).           The brief mention of one of\n\nthe older claims in a reply brief is inadequate; \"[e]ven if\n\npreserved below, the argument has to be renewed in the opening\n\nbrief on appeal, so that the appellee has a chance to respond.\"\n\nId.\n\n          There are no \"extraordinary circumstances\" that prompt\n\nus to go beyond the claims properly made on appeal.                  Gemco\n\nLatinoamerica, Inc. v. Seiko Time Corp., 61 F.3d 94, 100 (1st\n\nCir. 1995).     FMLA leave may have played some part in the final\n\nstages of Keeler's deteriorating relationship with Putnam, but\n\nKeeler's loss of responsibilities and staff, his ever lower\n\nrating, and the elimination of bonuses are part of a downward\n\ntrajectory that began long before he began to take FMLA leave in\n\nlate   1995.    Whether   the    trajectory    was   itself   due   to   age\n\ndiscrimination is a different question, to which we now turn.\n\n          Keeler's main age discrimination claim is that his\n\nsuccessive     reverses   from   1993     onward--in   responsibilities,\n\ntitle, salary, bonuses and perquisites--were caused by Putnam's\n\nview that he (Keeler) was too old for his job.                The district\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fcourt narrowed the incidents it would consider to those that\n\noccurred not earlier than six months prior to Keeler's initial\n\ncomplaint to MCAD in March 1996; it excluded certain of the age-\n\nrelated statements that Keeler attributed to Putnam on the\n\nground that they were not offered by firsthand affidavit or\n\ndeposition;    it   then     concluded--as   to     the    remaining   adverse\n\nactions--that \"the overwhelming evidence of record [showed] that\n\n[Keeler] did not meet his employer's legitimate performance\n\nexpectations\" and that a stray remark of 1993 allegedly made by\n\nTaylor about Keeler being at retirement age did not create a\n\njury issue as to motive.4\n\n           On appeal, Keeler says that the district court should\n\nnot have narrowed the scope of the incidents it considered, and\n\nthat, even if the scope of inquiry was properly limited to\n\nevents    in   1996    and    thereafter,        enough    evidence    of   age\n\ndiscrimination remained for a jury trial.                 Keeler also attacks\n\nthe   district      court's    decision     to     exclude     other   alleged\n\nstatements bearing on age discrimination that were unsupported\n\nby first person affidavits or depositions, but the arguments for\n\nreversal on this issue are not substantial.                  By contrast, the\n\n\n      4\n     According to an affidavit from a former Putnam employee,\nTaylor allegedly said that because Keeler was \"at the age of\nmoving into retirement, he . . . was looking to bring in other\nindividuals to take over the functions that [Keeler] had under\nhis domain.\"\n\n                                    -14-\n\fstatute of limitations and the judgment as to the weight of the\n\nevidence both raise difficult questions.\n\n         In addressing the limitations issue, the district court\n\nset out in chronological order a parade of thirteen incidents\n\nclaimed by Keeler to involve adverse actions, beginning with the\n\nloss of some of his responsibilities in 1990.      The court then\n\nsaid that the first nine incidents occurred more than six months\n\nbefore March 1996 when Keeler filed his MCAD complaint and that\n\nthese earlier incidents could not be used \"to support\" his\n\nclaims of discrimination.    Keeler has claimed throughout that\n\nsuch pre-1996 incidents could be the basis for recovery on a\n\n\"continuing     violation\"   theory   recognized    under    both\n\nMassachusetts and federal decisions.    E.g., Thomas v. Eastman\n\nKodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 53-54 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120\n\nS. Ct. 1174 (2000); Lynn Teachers Union v. MCAD, 549 N.E.2d 97,\n\n100 (Mass. 1990).\n\n         The continuing violation concept has provoked endless\n\nconfusion, 2 Lindemann & Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law\n\n1351 (3d ed. 1996), but if what Keeler characterizes as the\n\n\"federal\" approach were taken, the concept would not help Keeler\n\nin this case.   This court has treated the concept primarily as\n\na tolling device, allowing a plaintiff to reach back to recover\n\nfor earlier related incidents--otherwise barred by a statute of\n\n\n                              -15-\n\flimitations--where at the time they occurred the plaintiff had\n\nno reason to know that a wrong had been committed.                  Provencher\n\nv. CVS Pharmacy, 145 F.3d 5, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1998); Sabree v.\n\nUnited Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners Local No. 33, 921 F.2d 396,\n\n402 (1st Cir. 1990).          Here, Keeler admitted that by 1994, long\n\nbefore he filed his complaint, he already suspected that age\n\ndiscrimination was at work.\n\n             However, Massachusetts law governs here and (according\n\nto Keeler) is more generous to plaintiffs.                     Frankly, we are\n\nuncertain.     An MCAD regulation bearing on the question, Mass.\n\nRegs.   Code   tit.    804,    §   1.10(2)   (1998),      is   ambiguous;   the\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Judicial Court to which we have been\n\ncited   do    not    clearly    resolve    the   issue;    and    lower   court\n\ndecisions     in    Massachusetts    are    divided:   several     follow   the\n\nfederal approach, but one judge predicts that the SJC would\n\noverride the limitations period in certain continuing violation\n\ncases where the federal approach would not.5                    Absent clearer\n\n\n\n    5 Compare Clifton v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., No.\nCiv.A. 95-2686-H, 2000 WL 218397, at *5-*6 (Mass. Super. Ct.\nFeb. 3, 2000) (Gants, J.) (rejecting the federal approach), and\nDe Almeida v.

Cf. Kassel v. Gannett Co.,\n\n875 F.2d 935, 949-50 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n                Even if it is supposed that the SJC may take a more\n\nplaintiff-friendly approach, this is more likely to occur in\n\ncases of ongoing harassment where pinpricks may only slowly add\n\nup to a wound.          Here, by contrast, Keeler suffered a sequence of\n\nfairly      discrete     and     individually     major    adjustments      in    pay,\n\ntitle, responsibilities, and the like; and it is not easy to see\n\nwhy an MCAD complaint should have been deferred once Keeler\n\nconcluded in 1994 that age discrimination might underlie some of\n\nthese actions.           Of course, Keeler may still use the earlier\n\nevents as background evidence of discrimination even where he\n\ncannot recover for them.                Sabree, 921 F.2d at 400 n.9.\n\n                This brings us to the next issue:            whether Keeler had\n\nenough evidence of age discrimination causing adverse action to\n\nget    to   a    jury    once    the    statute   of    limitations      barred   his\n\nrecovery for incidents prior to September 1995 (i.e., six months\n\nbefore his MCAD complaint was first filed).                  The issue is closer\n\nthan    the      district       court    realized      because   among    the     nine\n\nincidents that it excluded from consideration on statute of\n\nlimitations grounds, one was not an employment action at all but\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\frather an alleged statement by Taylor that goes to motivation.\n\nAccording to Keeler, Taylor told Keeler on August 9, 1993, the\n\nday after Keeler turned 63, that \"due to his age he . . . would\n\nbe given less responsibility at the same pay . . . and with the\n\nsame title, and that his job would be less stressful.\"\n\n             Adding this to the remark about Keeler's being at\n\nretirement age, there were two admissible statements suggesting\n\ndiscriminatory intent that Taylor allegedly made in 1993.                       If we\n\nwere concerned with adverse actions taken against Keeler close\n\nin time to these statements, a case might exist for a jury,\n\nespecially      because    up       to   that    point     in     1993,   Keeler's\n\nevaluations      were     good,      with       few   complaints      about      his\n\nperformance.       Thus,      the    appointment      of   Chafin    in   1993    to\n\nsupervise data communications and the reduction of Keeler's\n\nstaff by roughly 25 members might have created a jury issue as\n\nto     age   discrimination,         even    though      Putnam    has    its    own\n\nexplanations     for    the    change       (burgeoning    workload,      Chafin's\n\nspecial expertise in managing information systems).                       But, of\n\ncourse, this 1993 revision of duties is one of the incidents\n\nexcluded by the statute of limitations ruling as a basis for\n\nrecovery.\n\n             By contrast, at the time of the incidents in late 1995\n\nthat     fall   within     the      statute      of   limitations,        Keeler's\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\fperformance rating had been declining for some time, and persons\n\nother   than    Taylor   had   criticized    Keeler's   work     on   various\n\nprojects.      From late 1993 on, the evaluations for the most part\n\nwere made by Chafin, who has not been taxed with having made any\n\nage-related comments; similarly, the complaints about Keeler's\n\nperformance, although less substantial than Putnam asserts, have\n\nalso not been shown to be linked to age discrimination.6              Whether\n\nthey were fair criticisms or attempts to shift blame for delays\n\non difficult projects is beside the point, so long as they were\n\nnot age-motivated.\n\n            In the end, we think no reasonable jury could attribute\n\nthe adverse actions from late 1995 onward to two alleged remarks\n\nmade in 1993, at least one of them quite ambiguous (as Keeler\n\nadmits).       Here,   there   exists   in   the   interim   a   record    of\n\nperformance-related criticisms, principally by or to Chafin (not\n\nTaylor); and there is a telling lack of substantial, specific\n\nevidence that Keeler was treated differently from younger but\n\notherwise similarly situated employees.             On this record the\n\n\n    6 Keeler received mixed reviews while working on the so-\ncalled \"Artemis\" project involving computer software.    Chafin\nwas also concerned that Keeler had difficulties in completing\nthe company's project to provide Internet access to employees,\nthat Keeler had not completed the last two stages of a capacity\nplanning project, and that he did not complete another project\nfor Putnam's Andover office.    Finally, Janet Green, another\nemployee, complained about mistakes made by Keeler during an\naudit.\n\n                                   -19-\n\fdistrict court was entitled to grant summary judgment as to the\n\nage discrimination claim.         See Wooster v.    Abdow Corp., 709\n\nN.E.2d 71, 76-78 (Mass. App. Ct. 1999); Tardanico v. Aetna Life\n\n& Cas. Co., 671 N.E.2d 510, 514-15 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996).\n\n          We turn now to count IV of the complaint charging\n\nPutnam with failing to conduct an adequate investigation of\n\nKeeler's age discrimination charge after Keeler (in April 1996)\n\ncomplained inside the company that he was a victim of such\n\ndiscrimination.   Putnam says that the record shows that Putnam\n\ndid make a good faith investigation as soon as Keeler made the\n\ncharge.   The district court did not resolve the contest but\n\ninstead granted summary judgment for Putnam on the ground that\n\nthe court's rejection of the substantive age discrimination\n\nclaim precluded liability for a failure to investigate.\n\n          On   appeal,   Keeler     claims   that   \"[t]he   duty   to\n\ninvestigate . . . may form an independent basis for liability,\"\n\nbut the Massachusetts decisions he cites are of relatively\n\nlittle help to him.   In College-Town, Division of Interco, Inc.\n\nv. MCAD, 508 N.E.2d 587, 594 (Mass. 1987), the SJC did indeed\n\nrefer to a duty to investigate; but it did so in explaining why\n\nthe defendant company could be held liable for sexual harassment\n\nthat had been committed by a supervisor, reported by the victim\n\nto higher management, and not adequately investigated or curbed.\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fNothing in the opinion suggests that, if there had been                  no\n\nsexual harassment, the failure to investigate claim could have\n\ngiven rise to any independent liability.7\n\n             Nothing would prevent a legislature from enacting a\n\nstatute      that   required   an   employer   to   investigate   colorable\n\nclaims, and that awarded damages (if any) for the failure to do\n\nso,   even    where    no   substantive   discrimination    had   occurred.\n\nHowever, nothing in the Massachusetts statute suggests such an\n\nintention to us, and the reference in College-Town to the duty\n\nto investigate makes far more sense as a further explanation for\n\nimposing liability on an employer who was told correctly that\n\nharassment had occurred but did nothing to prevent it.              And, of\n\ncourse, the damages for failure to investigate would be quite\n\ndifferent in character and amount than the type normally awarded\n\nfor discrimination.\n\n             Finally, the district court did not rule on the merits\n\nof    count III, the retaliation claim, but remanded it to the\n\nstate court.          The federal claim having been dismissed, the\n\ndistrict court deemed a remand appropriate partly because of\n\n\n\n      7\n     Keeler also cites Moore v. Boston Fire Dep't, 22 M.D.L.R.\n294, 299-301 (MCAD 2000); Beldo v. University of Mass. Boston,\n20 M.D.L.R. 105, 112 (MCAD 1998); Kenney v.

However, none of these cases even\narguably extends the holding in College-Town.\n\n                                     -21-\n\fsome uncertainty under state law as to whether the retaliation\n\nclaim had been adequately preserved.     Neither Keeler nor Putnam\n\nhas   challenged   this   disposition   and   we   leave   the   remand\n\nundisturbed.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.          Each\n\nside shall bear its own costs in this appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\f",

(\"Putnam\") and others. Keeler charged Putnam with age discrimination under state law, violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2601-54 (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996), and other alleged wrongs. The district court gave summary judgment for the defendants on all but one state-law claim, which it remanded to state court, and Keeler has now appealed. We begin with a brief outline of events, giving due preference to Keeler's version of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Gavan Taylor, a senior executive at Putnam, recommended hiring Keeler--then 57 years of age--to manage Putnam's mainframe computer services functions. Keeler's title was senior vice president. During the period 1987-1993, Keeler was highly rated in Putnam's regular evaluations. His base salary grew to just over $90,000 and he received year-end bonuses ranging up to $33,100. However, as early as 1990, Keeler's responsibilities were narrowed to focus on data communications and other new technology, and some of his staff were reassigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1993, Taylor hired a new senior vice president, Jack Chafin (age 49) to manage data communications. Keeler lost another chunk of his staff, and his duties were limited to computer-related planning, disaster recovery, data security, and some administrative tasks. Although he had once had as many as 85 or more employees to supervise, his new duties after August 1993 left him with only about five employees. However, Keeler remained a senior vice president with the same salary. At the end of the year Keeler got a very good performance evaluation and a sizable $33,000 bonus but, unlike other senior vice presidents, he did not get any appreciable raise in salary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, Taylor told Keeler that he would not receive his usual large bonus at the end of the year because of his reduced duties. In December 1994, Keeler was redesignated vice president and lost the accouterments of a senior vice president (a large office, reserved parking). His year-end bonus, now based on a less favorable bonus plan, shrank to $7,300. His job evaluation for the year (made in January 1995), although still adequate (3+), fell from the higher ranking (4) that he had previously enjoyed (the maximum was 5). In December 1994, concerned about possible age discrimination, Keeler contacted a lawyer whom he knew had represented employment discrimination plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Keeler was assigned to work on a significant project to provide Internet access to Putnam employees; but, after some controversy about his handling of the project, he was removed in mid-1995. Disagreement also arose about Keeler's handling of another matter involving Putnam's response to audit inquiries. Chafin's mid-year assessment graded Keeler's performance at a lower level (3), and in the fall Taylor told him that his rating would be downgraded further (to 2). When the physical condition of Keeler's wife deteriorated in December 1995, Keeler began to take periods of leave to care for her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keeler received no bonus for 1995 and, in 1996, another controversy arose about a delay in completing a local area network security audit. In March 1996, Chafin removed Keeler from supervision of disaster recovery and data security. On March 20, 1996, Keeler filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\"), claiming age discrimination. By a letter of March 29, 1996, Keeler advised Putnam of the complaint and asked for a substantial change in position or a substantial severance package. After receipt of the letter, Putnam, on April 2, 1996, escorted Keeler from the premises and placed him on paid leave. Within a week, Putnam withdrew the suspension, after Keeler's attorney warned Putnam that its action represented retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period and continuing through the rest of 1996, Putnam's wife was repeatedly hospitalized. Keeler took more than 30 days away from work to care for her or as personal sick days, and the company always approved his absences. At the same time, Keeler was given new projects. However, in February 1997, Keeler received a low performance rating (2+) and his review noted that Keeler's \"[a]ttendance [was] unpredictable in 1996 and part of 1995.\" Keeler asked Putnam to change the evaluation, provide him a performance improvement plan, and reinstate him as a senior vice president. Putnam declined. Keeler resigned on March 21, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1998, Keeler brought suit against Putnam in Massachusetts state court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The complaint set forth six claims under Massachusetts law: intentional age discrimination (count I) and disparate-impact age discrimination (count II), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4 (1998); retaliation following his complaint (count III), id. at &#167;&#167; 4, 4(4); failure to investigate and remedy discrimination (count IV); violation of Massachusetts' Equal Rights Act because of age discrimination (count V), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93, &#167; 103 (1998); and defamation (count VI). A seventh, federal claim was for discrimination in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (count VII).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putnam removed the case to the district court and, after extensive discovery by both sides, Putnam moved for summary judgment on August 10, 1999. For reasons more fully explained below, the district court granted summary judgment to Putnam on all counts other than retaliation and remanded that count to state court (because of difficult issues of state law as to exhaustion and the statute of limitations). Keeler now appeals from the grant of summary judgment only as to the counts charging intentional age discrimination, failure to investigate, and medical leave discrimination (counts I, IV, and VII).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review on a grant of summary judgment is de novo, Landrau-Romero v. Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, 212 F.3d 607, 611 (1st Cir. 2000), and we begin with the sole federal claim. Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, Keeler was entitled to take \"a total of 12 workweeks of leave during any 12-month period\" to care for a spouse suffering from a \"serious health condition,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 2612(a)(1), and, more to the point, Putnam could not lawfully \"interfere with, restrain, or deny\" Keeler's exercise of this right, id. &#167; 2615(a)(1). Regulations, not here challenged, prohibit an employer \"from discriminating against employees . . . who have used FMLA leave\" or from using such leave \"as a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, promotions or disciplinary actions.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.220(c) (2000); accord Hodgens v. General Dynamics Corp., 144 F.3d 151, 159-60 (1st Cir. 1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court began its analysis with the framework adopted in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802-04 (1973), which involved a Title VII claim that racial discrimination underlay a denial of employment. The decision held that, following a rather low threshold showing by the would-be employee, an employer has an obligation to \"articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the [applicant's] rejection,\" absent which discrimination may be presumed. Id. at 802. With necessary adjustments to the threshold showing, McDonnell Douglas has been adapted to other kinds of discrimination claims, including FMLA claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When McDonnell Douglas applies, the employer normally seeks to proffer some colorable nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action. The plaintiff may then say that the reason is pretext and the true reason is forbidden discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804. In that event, depending on the record, there may or may not be legitimate issues for a factfinder as to the true motive, causation and injury. But the adverse presumption disappears, and the plaintiff retains the ordinary burden of proving discrimination. See Lawrence v. Northrop Corp., 980 F.2d 66, 69-70 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time summary judgment was sought, Putnam had advanced a host of nondiscriminatory reasons for its challenged actions. Based on deposition and documentary evidence, Putnam painted a picture of Keeler failing in a series of important assignments from 1993 onward, of efforts by the company to protect his pay and status while getting others to carry on the work, and of Keeler failing to admit his weaknesses as a manager or to undertake to correct them. Of course, most of the evidence came from Putnam's officials and could be challenged, but certainly Putnam colorably \"explained\" with nondiscriminatory reasons the adjustment in pay status and evaluations it gave Keeler following his use of FMLA leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not decide the issue of motive. Instead, it concluded that Keeler had not satisfied a different condition that the court said was necessary to \"a prima facie case under the FMLA,\" namely, the requirement that Keeler have suffered \"an adverse employment action\" arguably ascribable to his use of FMLA leave. It is not clear whether the court regarded this as part of the McDonnell Douglas threshold showing or as part of the showing that a plaintiff must make to avoid summary judgment after the defendant's \"burden\" of explanation has been met.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In all events, Keeler does not dispute that to avoid summary judgment he had to create a trialworthy issue that Putnam had taken adverse employment action against him that was motivated at least in part by Keeler's use of protected leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In finding that no such trialworthy issue had been created, the district court took Keeler to be claiming that he suffered an adverse employment action after he took leave because his absences were reflected in negative reports and evaluations of his performance in 1996. The court said that negative performance evaluations were not themselves adverse employment actions, Sweeney v. West, 149 F.3d 550, 556 (7th Cir. 1998); and, taking Keeler to argue further that these evaluations contributed to his \"constructive discharge,\" the court said that, as a matter of law, a reasonable person would not take these incidents as creating \"intolerable working conditions\" amounting to constructive discharge. We think that the reasoning does not quite work but the grant of summary judgment was right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part of the confusion is due to the fact that Keeler, in opposing summary judgment, argued emphatically he had suffered a \"constructive discharge.\" This was always a dubious argument since \"constructive discharge\" usually describes harassment so severe and oppressive that staying on the job while seeking redress is intolerable. Landrau-Romero, 212 F.3d at 613; Ramos v. Davis &amp; Geck, Inc., 167 F.3d 727, 732-33 (1st Cir. 1999). Here, none of Putnam's actions were of such magnitude that Keeler was prevented from staying on while seeking remedies for any harm he had suffered. See Nunez-Soto v. Alvarado, 918 F.2d 1029, 1030-31 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also agree with Sweeney, 149 F.3d at 556, that not every comment about problems created by the use of leave can fairly be treated as an adverse employment action violating the FMLA. An employee's use of leave, while fully legitimate, can cause serious problems for the employee's performance of his tasks and require an employer to implement changes in how jobs are assigned and who does what within the organization. What is prevented is adverse action against the employee for using the protected leave. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.220(c). But in opposing summary judgment, Keeler did allege two different types of concrete injury never addressed by the district court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the loss of his remaining staff and important functions in March 1996 was due in part to displeasure at his use of FMLA leave and, that while this motivation was not expressed to him at the time (and he then thought that age discrimination was the reason), a private April 1996 memorandum refers to absence problems; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the absences, mentioned again in the year-end evaluation of his 1996 performance, resulted in his low \"2+\" rating which (he says) was an understood threat of dismissal, to which he yielded in order to retain lifetime health benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Keeler's opening brief mentions neither of the above injury claims in the context of his FMLA argument but, in addition to repeating the constructive discharge claim, offers a new claim of injury, namely, that the low \"2+\" rating allegedly disqualified Keeler from eligibility for a bonus for his 1996 work and that concern over absences may also explain the failure to give him a bonus for 1995 work (even though the downturn in his wife's health that triggered his taking significant FMLA leave did not occur until December 1995). Keeler refers to his earlier district court allegations of injury only briefly and in his reply brief in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, it would have been better for the district court to have addressed the two specific injury claims Keeler made in opposing summary judgment. But these claims are forfeit on appeal because neither one is renewed in Keeler's opening brief, which instead offers a new claim of injury not made in the district court and now unavailable. Wills v. Brown Univ., 184 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 1999). The brief mention of one of the older claims in a reply brief is inadequate; \"[e]ven if preserved below, the argument has to be renewed in the opening brief on appeal, so that the appellee has a chance to respond.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no \"extraordinary circumstances\" that prompt us to go beyond the claims properly made on appeal. Gemco Latinoamerica, Inc. v. Seiko Time Corp., 61 F.3d 94, 100 (1st Cir. 1995). FMLA leave may have played some part in the final stages of Keeler's deteriorating relationship with Putnam, but Keeler's loss of responsibilities and staff, his ever lower rating, and the elimination of bonuses are part of a downward trajectory that began long before he began to take FMLA leave in late 1995. Whether the trajectory was itself due to age discrimination is a different question, to which we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keeler's main age discrimination claim is that his successive reverses from 1993 onward--in responsibilities, title, salary, bonuses and perquisites--were caused by Putnam's view that he (Keeler) was too old for his job. The district court narrowed the incidents it would consider to those that occurred not earlier than six months prior to Keeler's initial complaint to MCAD in March 1996; it excluded certain of the age-related statements that Keeler attributed to Putnam on the ground that they were not offered by firsthand affidavit or deposition; it then concluded--as to the remaining adverse actions--that \"the overwhelming evidence of record [showed] that [Keeler] did not meet his employer's legitimate performance expectations\" and that a stray remark of 1993 allegedly made by Taylor about Keeler being at retirement age did not create a jury issue as to motive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Keeler says that the district court should not have narrowed the scope of the incidents it considered, and that, even if the scope of inquiry was properly limited to events in 1996 and thereafter, enough evidence of age discrimination remained for a jury trial. Keeler also attacks the district court's decision to exclude other alleged statements bearing on age discrimination that were unsupported by first person affidavits or depositions, but the arguments for reversal on this issue are not substantial. By contrast, the statute of limitations and the judgment as to the weight of the evidence both raise difficult questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the limitations issue, the district court set out in chronological order a parade of thirteen incidents claimed by Keeler to involve adverse actions, beginning with the loss of some of his responsibilities in 1990. The court then said that the first nine incidents occurred more than six months before March 1996 when Keeler filed his MCAD complaint and that these earlier incidents could not be used \"to support\" his claims of discrimination. Keeler has claimed throughout that such pre-1996 incidents could be the basis for recovery on a \"continuing violation\" theory recognized under both Massachusetts and federal decisions. E.g., Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 53-54 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 120 S. Ct. 1174 (2000); Lynn Teachers Union v. MCAD, 549 N.E.2d 97, 100 (Mass. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The continuing violation concept has provoked endless confusion, 2 Lindemann &amp; Grossman, Employment Discrimination Law 1351 (3d ed. 1996), but if what Keeler characterizes as the \"federal\" approach were taken, the concept would not help Keeler in this case. This court has treated the concept primarily as a tolling device, allowing a plaintiff to reach back to recover for earlier related incidents--otherwise barred by a statute of limitations--where at the time they occurred the plaintiff had no reason to know that a wrong had been committed. Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy, 145 F.3d 5, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1998); Sabree v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners Local No. 33, 921 F.2d 396, 402 (1st Cir. 1990). Here, Keeler admitted that by 1994, long before he filed his complaint, he already suspected that age discrimination was at work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Massachusetts law governs here and (according to Keeler) is more generous to plaintiffs. Frankly, we are uncertain. An MCAD regulation bearing on the question, Mass. Regs. Code tit. 804, &#167; 1.10(2) (1998), is ambiguous; the decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court to which we have been cited do not clearly resolve the issue; and lower court decisions in Massachusetts are divided: several follow the federal approach, but one judge predicts that the SJC would override the limitations period in certain continuing violation cases where the federal approach would not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Absent clearer guidance from Massachusetts courts, we will follow the well-established Provencher and Sabree approach in cases like this one governed by Massachusetts law. Cf. Kassel v. Gannett Co., 875 F.2d 935, 949-50 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if it is supposed that the SJC may take a more plaintiff-friendly approach, this is more likely to occur in cases of ongoing harassment where pinpricks may only slowly add up to a wound. Here, by contrast, Keeler suffered a sequence of fairly discrete and individually major adjustments in pay, title, responsibilities, and the like; and it is not easy to see why an MCAD complaint should have been deferred once Keeler concluded in 1994 that age discrimination might underlie some of these actions. Of course, Keeler may still use the earlier events as background evidence of discrimination even where he cannot recover for them. Sabree, 921 F.2d at 400 n.9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the next issue: whether Keeler had enough evidence of age discrimination causing adverse action to get to a jury once the statute of limitations barred his recovery for incidents prior to September 1995 (i.e., six months before his MCAD complaint was first filed). The issue is closer than the district court realized because among the nine incidents that it excluded from consideration on statute of limitations grounds, one was not an employment action at all but rather an alleged statement by Taylor that goes to motivation. According to Keeler, Taylor told Keeler on August 9, 1993, the day after Keeler turned 63, that \"due to his age he . . . would be given less responsibility at the same pay . . . and with the same title, and that his job would be less stressful.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adding this to the remark about Keeler's being at retirement age, there were two admissible statements suggesting discriminatory intent that Taylor allegedly made in 1993. If we were concerned with adverse actions taken against Keeler close in time to these statements, a case might exist for a jury, especially because up to that point in 1993, Keeler's evaluations were good, with few complaints about his performance. Thus, the appointment of Chafin in 1993 to supervise data communications and the reduction of Keeler's staff by roughly 25 members might have created a jury issue as to age discrimination, even though Putnam has its own explanations for the change (burgeoning workload, Chafin's special expertise in managing information systems). But, of course, this 1993 revision of duties is one of the incidents excluded by the statute of limitations ruling as a basis for recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, at the time of the incidents in late 1995 that fall within the statute of limitations, Keeler's performance rating had been declining for some time, and persons other than Taylor had criticized Keeler's work on various projects. From late 1993 on, the evaluations for the most part were made by Chafin, who has not been taxed with having made any age-related comments; similarly, the complaints about Keeler's performance, although less substantial than Putnam asserts, have also not been shown to be linked to age discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Whether they were fair criticisms or attempts to shift blame for delays on difficult projects is beside the point, so long as they were not age-motivated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we think no reasonable jury could attribute the adverse actions from late 1995 onward to two alleged remarks made in 1993, at least one of them quite ambiguous (as Keeler admits). Here, there exists in the interim a record of performance-related criticisms, principally by or to Chafin (not Taylor); and there is a telling lack of substantial, specific evidence that Keeler was treated differently from younger but otherwise similarly situated employees. On this record the district court was entitled to grant summary judgment as to the age discrimination claim. See Wooster v. Abdow Corp., 709 N.E.2d 71, 76-78 (Mass. App. Ct. 1999); Tardanico v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., 671 N.E.2d 510, 514-15 (Mass. App. Ct. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to count IV of the complaint charging Putnam with failing to conduct an adequate investigation of Keeler's age discrimination charge after Keeler (in April 1996) complained inside the company that he was a victim of such discrimination. Putnam says that the record shows that Putnam did make a good faith investigation as soon as Keeler made the charge. The district court did not resolve the contest but instead granted summary judgment for Putnam on the ground that the court's rejection of the substantive age discrimination claim precluded liability for a failure to investigate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Keeler claims that \"[t]he duty to investigate . . . may form an independent basis for liability,\" but the Massachusetts decisions he cites are of relatively little help to him. In College-Town, Division of Interco, Inc. v. MCAD, 508 N.E.2d 587, 594 (Mass. 1987), the SJC did indeed refer to a duty to investigate; but it did so in explaining why the defendant company could be held liable for sexual harassment that had been committed by a supervisor, reported by the victim to higher management, and not adequately investigated or curbed. Nothing in the opinion suggests that, if there had been no sexual harassment, the failure to investigate claim could have given rise to any independent liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing would prevent a legislature from enacting a statute that required an employer to investigate colorable claims, and that awarded damages (if any) for the failure to do so, even where no substantive discrimination had occurred. However, nothing in the Massachusetts statute suggests such an intention to us, and the reference in College-Town to the duty to investigate makes far more sense as a further explanation for imposing liability on an employer who was told correctly that harassment had occurred but did nothing to prevent it. And, of course, the damages for failure to investigate would be quite different in character and amount than the type normally awarded for discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court did not rule on the merits of count III, the retaliation claim, but remanded it to the state court. The federal claim having been dismissed, the district court deemed a remand appropriate partly because of some uncertainty under state law as to whether the retaliation claim had been adequately preserved. Neither Keeler nor Putnam has challenged this disposition and we leave the remand undisturbed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.

Keeler charged Putnam with age discrimination under state law, violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"), 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2601-54 (1994 &amp; Supp. II 1996), and other alleged wrongs. The district court gave summary judgment for the defendants on all but one state-law claim, which it remanded to state court, and Keeler has now appealed. We begin with a brief outline of events, giving due preference to Keeler's version of the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1987, Gavan Taylor, a senior executive at Putnam, recommended hiring Keeler--then 57 years of age--to manage Putnam's mainframe computer services functions. Keeler's title was senior vice president. During the period 1987-1993, Keeler was highly rated in Putnam's regular evaluations. His base salary grew to just over $90,000 and he received year-end bonuses ranging up to $33,100. However, as early as 1990, Keeler's responsibilities were narrowed to focus on data communications and other new technology, and some of his staff were reassigned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August 1993, Taylor hired a new senior vice president, Jack Chafin (age 49) to manage data communications. Keeler lost another chunk of his staff, and his duties were limited to computer-related planning, disaster recovery, data security, and some administrative tasks. Although he had once had as many as 85 or more employees to supervise, his new duties after August 1993 left him with only about five employees. However, Keeler remained a senior vice president with the same salary. At the end of the year Keeler got a very good performance evaluation and a sizable $33,000 bonus but, unlike other senior vice presidents, he did not get any appreciable raise in salary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, Taylor told Keeler that he would not receive his usual large bonus at the end of the year because of his reduced duties. In December 1994, Keeler was redesignated vice president and lost the accouterments of a senior vice president (a large office, reserved parking). His year-end bonus, now based on a less favorable bonus plan, shrank to $7,300. His job evaluation for the year (made in January 1995), although still adequate (3+), fell from the higher ranking (4) that he had previously enjoyed (the maximum was 5). In December 1994, concerned about possible age discrimination, Keeler contacted a lawyer whom he knew had represented employment discrimination plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Keeler was assigned to work on a significant project to provide Internet access to Putnam employees; but, after some controversy about his handling of the project, he was removed in mid-1995. Disagreement also arose about Keeler's handling of another matter involving Putnam's response to audit inquiries. Chafin's mid-year assessment graded Keeler's performance at a lower level (3), and in the fall Taylor told him that his rating would be downgraded further (to 2). When the physical condition of Keeler's wife deteriorated in December 1995, Keeler began to take periods of leave to care for her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keeler received no bonus for 1995 and, in 1996, another controversy arose about a delay in completing a local area network security audit. In March 1996, Chafin removed Keeler from supervision of disaster recovery and data security. On March 20, 1996, Keeler filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\"), claiming age discrimination. By a letter of March 29, 1996, Keeler advised Putnam of the complaint and asked for a substantial change in position or a substantial severance package. After receipt of the letter, Putnam, on April 2, 1996, escorted Keeler from the premises and placed him on paid leave. Within a week, Putnam withdrew the suspension, after Keeler's attorney warned Putnam that its action represented retaliation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During this period and continuing through the rest of 1996, Putnam's wife was repeatedly hospitalized. Keeler took more than 30 days away from work to care for her or as personal sick days, and the company always approved his absences. At the same time, Keeler was given new projects. However, in February 1997, Keeler received a low performance rating (2+) and his review noted that Keeler's \"[a]ttendance [was] unpredictable in 1996 and part of 1995.\" Keeler asked Putnam to change the evaluation, provide him a performance improvement plan, and reinstate him as a senior vice president. Putnam declined. Keeler resigned on March 21, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1998, Keeler brought suit against Putnam in Massachusetts state court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The complaint set forth six claims under Massachusetts law: intentional age discrimination (count I) and disparate-impact age discrimination (count II), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, &#167; 4 (1998); retaliation following his complaint (count III), id. at &#167;&#167; 4, 4(4); failure to investigate and remedy discrimination (count IV); violation of Massachusetts' Equal Rights Act because of age discrimination (count V), Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93, &#167; 103 (1998); and defamation (count VI). A seventh, federal claim was for discrimination in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (count VII).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putnam removed the case to the district court and, after extensive discovery by both sides, Putnam moved for summary judgment on August 10, 1999. For reasons more fully explained below, the district court granted summary judgment to Putnam on all counts other than retaliation and remanded that count to state court (because of difficult issues of state law as to exhaustion and the statute of limitations). Keeler now appeals from the grant of summary judgment only as to the counts charging intentional age discrimination, failure to investigate, and medical leave discrimination (counts I, IV, and VII).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review on a grant of summary judgment is de novo, Landrau-Romero v.

Regulations, not here challenged, prohibit an employer \"from discriminating against employees . . . who have used FMLA leave\" or from using such leave \"as a negative factor in employment actions, such as hiring, promotions or disciplinary actions.\" 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.220(c) (2000); accord Hodgens v.

The decision held that, following a rather low threshold showing by the would-be employee, an employer has an obligation to \"articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the [applicant's] rejection,\" absent which discrimination may be presumed. Id. at 802. With necessary adjustments to the threshold showing, McDonnell Douglas has been adapted to other kinds of discrimination claims, including FMLA claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When McDonnell Douglas applies, the employer normally seeks to proffer some colorable nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action. The plaintiff may then say that the reason is pretext and the true reason is forbidden discrimination. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 804. In that event, depending on the record, there may or may not be legitimate issues for a factfinder as to the true motive, causation and injury. But the adverse presumption disappears, and the plaintiff retains the ordinary burden of proving discrimination. See Lawrence v. Northrop Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595488\"><a href=\"/opinion/595488/60-fair-emplpraccas-bna-519-60-empl-prac-dec-p-41885-sidney-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span>, 69-70 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time summary judgment was sought, Putnam had advanced a host of nondiscriminatory reasons for its challenged actions. Based on deposition and documentary evidence, Putnam painted a picture of Keeler failing in a series of important assignments from 1993 onward, of efforts by the company to protect his pay and status while getting others to carry on the work, and of Keeler failing to admit his weaknesses as a manager or to undertake to correct them. Of course, most of the evidence came from Putnam's officials and could be challenged, but certainly Putnam colorably \"explained\" with nondiscriminatory reasons the adjustment in pay status and evaluations it gave Keeler following his use of FMLA leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not decide the issue of motive. Instead, it concluded that Keeler had not satisfied a different condition that the court said was necessary to \"a prima facie case under the FMLA,\" namely, the requirement that Keeler have suffered \"an adverse employment action\" arguably ascribable to his use of FMLA leave. It is not clear whether the court regarded this as part of the McDonnell Douglas threshold showing or as part of the showing that a plaintiff must make to avoid summary judgment after the defendant's \"burden\" of explanation has been met.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> In all events, Keeler does not dispute that to avoid summary judgment he had to create a trialworthy issue that Putnam had taken adverse employment action against him that was motivated at least in part by Keeler's use of protected leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In finding that no such trialworthy issue had been created, the district court took Keeler to be claiming that he suffered an adverse employment action after he took leave because his absences were reflected in negative reports and evaluations of his performance in 1996. The court said that negative performance evaluations were not themselves adverse employment actions, Sweeney v. West, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755815\"><a href=\"/opinion/755815/77-fair-emplpraccas-bna-890-74-empl-prac-dec-p-45496-nancy-r/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span>, 556 (7th Cir. 1998); and, taking Keeler to argue further that these evaluations contributed to his \"constructive discharge,\" the court said that, as a matter of law, a reasonable person would not take these incidents as creating \"intolerable working conditions\" amounting to constructive discharge. We think that the reasoning does not quite work but the grant of summary judgment was right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Part of the confusion is due to the fact that Keeler, in opposing summary judgment, argued emphatically he had suffered a \"constructive discharge.\" This was always a dubious argument since \"constructive discharge\" usually describes harassment so severe and oppressive that staying on the job while seeking redress is intolerable. Landrau-Romero, 212 F.3d at 613; Ramos v. Davis &amp; Geck, Inc., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></span>, 732-33 (1st Cir. 1999). Here, none of Putnam's actions were of such magnitude that Keeler was prevented from staying on while seeking remedies for any harm he had suffered. See Nunez-Soto v. Alvarado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551477\"><a href=\"/opinion/551477/casilda-nunez-soto-v-carlos-alvarado-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1029</span></a></span>, 1030-31 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also agree with Sweeney, 149 F.3d at 556, that not every comment about problems created by the use of leave can fairly be treated as an adverse employment action violating the FMLA. An employee's use of leave, while fully legitimate, can cause serious problems for the employee's performance of his tasks and require an employer to implement changes in how jobs are assigned and who does what within the organization. What is prevented is adverse action against the employee for using the protected leave. See 29 C.F.R. &#167; 825.220(c). But in opposing summary judgment, Keeler did allege two different types of concrete injury never addressed by the district court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the loss of his remaining staff and important functions in March 1996 was due in part to displeasure at his use of FMLA leave and, that while this motivation was not expressed to him at the time (and he then thought that age discrimination was the reason), a private April 1996 memorandum refers to absence problems; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the absences, mentioned again in the year-end evaluation of his 1996 performance, resulted in his low \"2+\" rating which (he says) was an understood threat of dismissal, to which he yielded in order to retain lifetime health benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Keeler's opening brief mentions neither of the above injury claims in the context of his FMLA argument but, in addition to repeating the constructive discharge claim, offers a new claim of injury, namely, that the low \"2+\" rating allegedly disqualified Keeler from eligibility for a bonus for his 1996 work and that concern over absences may also explain the failure to give him a bonus for 1995 work (even though the downturn in his wife's health that triggered his taking significant FMLA leave did not occur until December 1995). Keeler refers to his earlier district court allegations of injury only briefly and in his reply brief in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly, it would have been better for the district court to have addressed the two specific injury claims Keeler made in opposing summary judgment. But these claims are forfeit on appeal because neither one is renewed in Keeler's opening brief, which instead offers a new claim of injury not made in the district court and now unavailable. Wills v. Brown Univ., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765225\"><a href=\"/opinion/765225/marketa-wills-v-brown-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir. 1999). The brief mention of one of the older claims in a reply brief is inadequate; \"[e]ven if preserved below, the argument has to be renewed in the opening brief on appeal, so that the appellee has a chance to respond.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no \"extraordinary circumstances\" that prompt us to go beyond the claims properly made on appeal.

FMLA leave may have played some part in the final stages of Keeler's deteriorating relationship with Putnam, but Keeler's loss of responsibilities and staff, his ever lower rating, and the elimination of bonuses are part of a downward trajectory that began long before he began to take FMLA leave in late 1995. Whether the trajectory was itself due to age discrimination is a different question, to which we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keeler's main age discrimination claim is that his successive reverses from 1993 onward--in responsibilities, title, salary, bonuses and perquisites--were caused by Putnam's view that he (Keeler) was too old for his job. The district court narrowed the incidents it would consider to those that occurred not earlier than six months prior to Keeler's initial complaint to MCAD in March 1996; it excluded certain of the age-related statements that Keeler attributed to Putnam on the ground that they were not offered by firsthand affidavit or deposition; it then concluded--as to the remaining adverse actions--that \"the overwhelming evidence of record [showed] that [Keeler] did not meet his employer's legitimate performance expectations\" and that a stray remark of 1993 allegedly made by Taylor about Keeler being at retirement age did not create a jury issue as to motive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Keeler says that the district court should not have narrowed the scope of the incidents it considered, and that, even if the scope of inquiry was properly limited to events in 1996 and thereafter, enough evidence of age discrimination remained for a jury trial. Keeler also attacks the district court's decision to exclude other alleged statements bearing on age discrimination that were unsupported by first person affidavits or depositions, but the arguments for reversal on this issue are not substantial. By contrast, the statute of limitations and the judgment as to the weight of the evidence both raise difficult questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing the limitations issue, the district court set out in chronological order a parade of thirteen incidents claimed by Keeler to involve adverse actions, beginning with the loss of some of his responsibilities in 1990. The court then said that the first nine incidents occurred more than six months before March 1996 when Keeler filed his MCAD complaint and that these earlier incidents could not be used \"to support\" his claims of discrimination. Keeler has claimed throughout that such pre-1996 incidents could be the basis for recovery on a \"continuing violation\" theory recognized under both Massachusetts and federal decisions. E.g., Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765085\"><a href=\"/opinion/765085/myrtle-thomas-v-eastman-kodak-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">183</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 53-54 (1st Cir. 1999), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This court has treated the concept primarily as a tolling device, allowing a plaintiff to reach back to recover for earlier related incidents--otherwise barred by a statute of limitations--where at the time they occurred the plaintiff had no reason to know that a wrong had been committed.

Here, Keeler admitted that by 1994, long before he filed his complaint, he already suspected that age discrimination was at work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, Massachusetts law governs here and (according to Keeler) is more generous to plaintiffs. Frankly, we are uncertain. An MCAD regulation bearing on the question, Mass. Regs. Code tit. 804, &#167; 1.10(2) (1998), is ambiguous; the decisions of the Supreme Judicial Court to which we have been cited do not clearly resolve the issue; and lower court decisions in Massachusetts are divided: several follow the federal approach, but one judge predicts that the SJC would override the limitations period in certain continuing violation cases where the federal approach would not.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Absent clearer guidance from Massachusetts courts, we will follow the well-established Provencher and Sabree approach in cases like this one governed by Massachusetts law. Cf. Kassel v. Gannett Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524049\"><a href=\"/opinion/524049/jeffrey-kassel-v-gannett-co-inc-dba-usa-today/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span>, 949-50 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if it is supposed that the SJC may take a more plaintiff-friendly approach, this is more likely to occur in cases of ongoing harassment where pinpricks may only slowly add up to a wound. Here, by contrast, Keeler suffered a sequence of fairly discrete and individually major adjustments in pay, title, responsibilities, and the like; and it is not easy to see why an MCAD complaint should have been deferred once Keeler concluded in 1994 that age discrimination might underlie some of these actions. Of course, Keeler may still use the earlier events as background evidence of discrimination even where he cannot recover for them. Sabree, 921 F.2d at 400 n.9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the next issue: whether Keeler had enough evidence of age discrimination causing adverse action to get to a jury once the statute of limitations barred his recovery for incidents prior to September 1995 (i.e., six months before his MCAD complaint was first filed). The issue is closer than the district court realized because among the nine incidents that it excluded from consideration on statute of limitations grounds, one was not an employment action at all but rather an alleged statement by Taylor that goes to motivation. According to Keeler, Taylor told Keeler on August 9, 1993, the day after Keeler turned 63, that \"due to his age he . . . would be given less responsibility at the same pay . . . and with the same title, and that his job would be less stressful.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Adding this to the remark about Keeler's being at retirement age, there were two admissible statements suggesting discriminatory intent that Taylor allegedly made in 1993. If we were concerned with adverse actions taken against Keeler close in time to these statements, a case might exist for a jury, especially because up to that point in 1993, Keeler's evaluations were good, with few complaints about his performance. Thus, the appointment of Chafin in 1993 to supervise data communications and the reduction of Keeler's staff by roughly 25 members might have created a jury issue as to age discrimination, even though Putnam has its own explanations for the change (burgeoning workload, Chafin's special expertise in managing information systems). But, of course, this 1993 revision of duties is one of the incidents excluded by the statute of limitations ruling as a basis for recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, at the time of the incidents in late 1995 that fall within the statute of limitations, Keeler's performance rating had been declining for some time, and persons other than Taylor had criticized Keeler's work on various projects. From late 1993 on, the evaluations for the most part were made by Chafin, who has not been taxed with having made any age-related comments; similarly, the complaints about Keeler's performance, although less substantial than Putnam asserts, have also not been shown to be linked to age discrimination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Whether they were fair criticisms or attempts to shift blame for delays on difficult projects is beside the point, so long as they were not age-motivated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we think no reasonable jury could attribute the adverse actions from late 1995 onward to two alleged remarks made in 1993, at least one of them quite ambiguous (as Keeler admits). Here, there exists in the interim a record of performance-related criticisms, principally by or to Chafin (not Taylor); and there is a telling lack of substantial, specific evidence that Keeler was treated differently from younger but otherwise similarly situated employees. On this record the district court was entitled to grant summary judgment as to the age discrimination claim. See Wooster v. Abdow Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></span>, 76-78 (Mass. App. Ct. 1999); Tardanico v.

Putnam says that the record shows that Putnam did make a good faith investigation as soon as Keeler made the charge. The district court did not resolve the contest but instead granted summary judgment for Putnam on the ground that the court's rejection of the substantive age discrimination claim precluded liability for a failure to investigate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Keeler claims that \"[t]he duty to investigate . . . may form an independent basis for liability,\" but the Massachusetts decisions he cites are of relatively little help to him. In College-Town, Division of Interco, Inc. v. MCAD, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">587</span></span>, 594 (Mass. 1987), the SJC did indeed refer to a duty to investigate; but it did so in explaining why the defendant company could be held liable for sexual harassment that had been committed by a supervisor, reported by the victim to higher management, and not adequately investigated or curbed. Nothing in the opinion suggests that, if there had been no sexual harassment, the failure to investigate claim could have given rise to any independent liability.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing would prevent a legislature from enacting a statute that required an employer to investigate colorable claims, and that awarded damages (if any) for the failure to do so, even where no substantive discrimination had occurred. However, nothing in the Massachusetts statute suggests such an intention to us, and the reference in College-Town to the duty to investigate makes far more sense as a further explanation for imposing liability on an employer who was told correctly that harassment had occurred but did nothing to prevent it. And, of course, the damages for failure to investigate would be quite different in character and amount than the type normally awarded for discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court did not rule on the merits of count III, the retaliation claim, but remanded it to the state court. The federal claim having been dismissed, the district court deemed a remand appropriate partly because of some uncertainty under state law as to whether the retaliation claim had been adequately preserved. Neither Keeler nor Putnam has challenged this disposition and we leave the remand undisturbed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.
