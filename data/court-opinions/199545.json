Plaintiffs-appellants1 Faustina\n\nDávila-Alvarez, Ramón Fernández, Rosa Alvarez-Oquendo and Rafael\n\nFernández filed the tort action underlying this appeal in the Puerto\n\nRico courts on November 7, 1995.       It was removed to the federal\n\ndistrict court for the District of Puerto Rico on November 25, 1997.\n\nOn April 12, 1998, plaintiffs' counsel, José Antonio Méndez Rodríguez\n\n(José Méndez), died suddenly and unexpectedly. His brother and law\n\npartner, Roberto Méndez Rodríguez (Roberto Méndez), assumed\n\nresponsibility for the case. After receiving no response to discovery\n\nrequests filed as early as February 1998, defendants moved for\n\ndismissal for lack of prosecution. The district court granted this\n\nmotion and dismissed with prejudice on December 14, 1998. Plaintiffs,\n\nrepresented by new counsel, sought relief from judgment under Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1) and 60(b)(6). The district court\n\ndenied this request. Dávila Alvarez v. Escuela de Medicina Universidad\n\nCentral del Caribe, Civ. No. 97-2793 (JAF) (D.P.R. Mar. 28, 2000).\n\nFinding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nrefusing to grant relief, we affirm.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n1 Throughout the opinion we refer to plaintiffs-appellants Dávila-\nAlvarez, et. al., as either \"plaintiffs\" or \"appellants\" depending on\nthe stage of the litigation at issue.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          We present the procedural history of this litigation in some\n\ndetail, as it supports the district court's refusal to grant relief\n\nfrom judgment.\n\n          On November 7, 1995, plaintiffs filed this medical\n\nmalpractice claim in Bayamón Superior Court, a Puerto Rico court of\n\nfirst instance. José Méndez, of the law firm of Méndez & Méndez, was\n\ncounsel of record. The firm's address was listed with the court as\n\nTropical #30, Muñoz Rivera, Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. On July 23, 1996,\n\nJosé Méndez filed an Informative Motion in the Puerto Rico court noting\n\nchanges to the firm's street and mailing addresses.2 On November 25,\n\n1997, co-defendant3 Dr. Susana Schwartz removed the case to federal\n\ndistrict court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1), 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d),\n\nand 42 U.S.C. § 233.4 The notice of removal was served to José Méndez\n\nat his former address, Tropical #30.\n\n          Although the case had been removed to federal court and\n\ndismissed from the Puerto Rico courts, José Méndez filed a second\n\n\n\n2 The new street address was 1848 Glasgow Avenue, College Park, Rio\nPiedras, Puerto Rico. The new mailing address was P.O. Box 70150,\nSuite 128, San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n3 There is some dispute as to whether Dr. Schwartz should be considered\na co-defendant or a third-party defendant; for purposes of this appeal,\nthe distinction is irrelevant.\n4 Schwartz did so as an officer of the United States Department of\nHealth and Human Services who had obtained a certification from the\nUnited States Attorney that she was acting within the scope of her\nfederal employment at the time of the conduct complained of.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fInformative Motion in Bayamón Superior Court on January 13, 1998,\n\nnoting another change in the mailing address of Méndez & Méndez, to\n\nP.O. Box 270128, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Counsel for defendants were\n\nalso served with notice of the new address. On January 23, 1998, the\n\nBayamón Superior Court issued a Notice of Judgment to the correct Box\n\n270128 address, informing José Méndez that judgment had issued, and the\n\ncase dismissed from the Bayamón court, as of December 11, 1997. The\n\nDecember 11, 1997 dismissal order clearly stated that the case was\n\ndismissed under 28 U.S.C. § 1446, the federal removal statute. As\n\nappellants concede that José Méndez received the Notice of Judgment\n\nfrom the Bayamón Superior Court on January 28, 1998, he was on notice\n\nas of that date that the case had been dismissed from the Puerto Rico\n\ncourts because it had been removed to federal district court.\n\n          Also on January 23, 1998, the United States was substituted\n\nas defendant for Dr. Schwartz pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2679. Notice of\n\nthis substitution was sent by first-class mail to José Méndez at his\n\nformer address, Tropical #30. On February 2, 1998, the United States\n\nsubmitted a responsive pleading, which was again sent to the incorrect\n\nTropical #30 address. On February 3 and February 4, 1998, the United\n\nStates sent interrogatories and filed a request for the production of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdocuments, again to the wrong address. There is no evidence, for the\n\nmost part, that these documents ever arrived at Méndez & Méndez.5\n\n          Because José Méndez was not admitted to practice before the\n\nfederal court, at some point in January or February of 1998, he\n\ncontacted attorney Enrique Mendoza about the possibility of referring\n\nthe case. The record shows only that Mendoza solicited research on a\n\nrelevant legal issue from a third attorney.6 On February 23, 1998,\n\nMendoza faxed the results of this research to José Méndez. There is no\n\nevidence in the record that Mendoza accepted the referral, and no\n\nmotion was filed informing the district court of a change of counsel.\n\nJosé Méndez also did not inform the district court at this point that\n\nhe was not admitted to the federal bar.\n\n          On   April   12,   1998,    José   Méndez   died   suddenly   and\n\nunexpectedly. Upon his death, Roberto Méndez assumed responsibility\n\nfor all of his current cases. Roberto Méndez was also not admitted to\n\npractice before the federal court.\n\n\n\n5 There is strong circumstantial evidence that José Méndez received at\nleast the notice informing him of the United States' substitution as a\ndefendant in a timely fashion. His correspondence with Enrique Mendoza\nin early 1998 presented a fact scenario based on such a substitution.\nSee infra at n.10.\n6 After removing the case, the United States had claimed that the suit\nwas barred for failure to pursue administrative remedies required under\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). Mendoza had asked attorney Lisa\nDrucker Shub to research whether, in a case where a plaintiff was\nunaware of defendant's federal employment status prior to removal, the\nstatute of limitations acted to bar an administrative claim.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f          On June 8, 1998, the district court issued a Scheduling Order\n\nproviding that the pleadings be finalized by July 17, 1998, that\n\ndiscovery be completed by October 8, 1998, and that any dispositive\n\nmotion be filed prior to November 9, 1998. A pretrial conference was\n\nscheduled for December 8, 1998. It is unclear from the record whether\n\nthe Order was sent to Méndez & Méndez at the Tropical #30 address or at\n\nthe correct Box 270128 address.7\n\n          On October 21, 1998, the United States filed a motion\n\nrequesting dismissal for want of prosecution, noting that its\n\ninterrogatories and requests for document production, propounded in\n\nFebruary of 1998, had gone unanswered, and that the time for discovery\n\nset forth in the Scheduling Order had elapsed. This motion was later\n\njoined by co-defendant Escuela de Medicina. Both motions were noticed\n\nto the now-deceased José Méndez at his Tropical #30 address. Counsel\n\nfor Escuela de Medicina also submitted an affidavit stating that he had\n\nleft more than a dozen phone messages for Roberto Méndez (both upon the\n\nJune receipt of the Scheduling Order and in the days prior to the\n\nDecember pre-trial conference) that had gone unreturned.            On\n\nDecember 8, 1998, the motion for dismissal was granted. Judgment was\n\nentered as of December 14, 1998.\n\n\n\n7 A copy of the civil docket included in the appendices indicates that,\nas of July 11, 2000, the district court had the Tropical #30 address on\nfile for José Méndez and the P.O. Box 270128 on file for both the law\nfirm Méndez & Méndez and for Roberto Méndez.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          Between José Méndez's death on April 12, 1998 and December\n\n3, 1998, Roberto Méndez took no action regarding this case.         On\n\nDecember 3, 1998, he forwarded a \"cross-claimant complaint\" to Mendoza.\n\nThe same day, Mendoza responded that he \"really [had] no interest in\n\nparticipating in this case.\" On December 15, 1998, a day after the\n\ndistrict court had entered judgment, Roberto Méndez asked the court for\n\na thirty day extension in order to find new representation for\n\nplaintiffs.   In his request, Méndez claimed that until receiving\n\nMendoza's December 3 fax disclaiming any responsibility for the\n\nlitigation, it had been his understanding that Mendoza had assumed\n\nrepresentation prior to José Méndez's death.\n\n          New counsel for plaintiffs sought relief from judgment on\n\nthis basis in a Rule 60(b) motion filed January 19, 1999. The district\n\ncourt denied the motion in an Opinion and Order dated March 28, 2000.\n\nIn particular, the court noted that: (i) Roberto Méndez had\n\ninexplicably failed to notify the district court of the death of José\n\nMéndez; (ii) instead of making the incorrect assumption that Enrique\n\nMendoza had assumed responsibility for the case, Roberto Méndez \"should\n\nhave assured himself of this fact\"; (iii) the multiple messages left by\n\ndefendants with the secretary at Méndez & Méndez should have alerted\n\nRoberto Méndez to the imminent expiration of the time for discovery;\n\n(iv) although the Rule 60(b) petition focused on the incorrect address\n\nused by defendants (and perhaps the court), at no point did appellants'\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcounsel affirmatively state that Méndez & Méndez had failed to receive\n\nthe relevant motions and notices at the firm's new address; and (v)\n\nJosé Méndez should have filed a change of address form with the federal\n\ncourt after receiving notice of removal. A subsequent request for\n\nreconsideration was denied on May 25, 2000.        This appeal followed.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1) allows the court to\n\nrelieve a party from a final judgment for \"mistake, inadvertence,\n\nsurprise, or excusable neglect.\" As motions brought under Rule 60(b)\n\nare \"committed to the court's sound discretion,\" we review here only to\n\ndetermine if the district court abused its discretion in refusing to\n\ngrant appellants' motion. Torre v. Continental Ins. Co., 15 F.3d 12,\n\n14-15 (1st Cir. 1994). Although many courts have indicated that Rule\n\n60(b) motions should be granted liberally,8 this Circuit has taken a\n\nharsher tack. \"Because Rule 60(b) is a vehicle for 'extraordinary\n\nrelief,' motions invoking the rule should be granted 'only under\n\nexceptional circumstances.'\" Id. (quoting Lepore v. Vidockler, 792\n\nF.2d 272, 274 (1st Cir. 1986)). The rule must be applied so as to\n\n\"recognize the desirability of deciding disputes on their merits,\"\n\nwhile also considering \"the importance of finality as applied to court\n\n8 See, e.g., Solaroll Shade & Shutter Corp. v. Bio-Energy Sys., Inc.,\n803 F.2d 1130, 1132 (11th Cir. 1986); Blois v. Friday, 612 F.3d 938,\n940 (5th Cir. 1980); Radack v. Norwegian Am. Line Agency, Inc., 318\nF.2d 538, 542 (2d Cir. 1963); 11 Wright, Miller & Kane, Federal\nPractice & Procedure, § 2852, at 231 (1995).\n\n                                 -9-\n\fjudgments.\" Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen & Helpers Union, Local\n\nNo. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 19-20 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nAlthough these authorities must now be read with the gloss supplied by\n\nthe Supreme Court in Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick Assocs. Ltd.\n\nP'ship, 507 U.S. 380 (1993), they still remain instructive.9\n\n          Appellants argue that José Méndez's death, Roberto Méndez's\n\nbelief that the case had been transferred to Enrique Mendoza, and the\n\nfact that many of the motions and notices were sent to the incorrect\n\naddress make their failure to prosecute \"excusable neglect.\"       Our\n\nevaluation of what constitutes excusable neglect is an equitable\n\ndetermination, taking into account the entire facts and circumstances\n\nsurrounding the party's omission, including factors such as the danger\n\nof prejudice to the non-movant, the length of the delay, the reason for\n\nthe delay, and whether the movant acted in good faith. Id. at 395.\n\nAfter considering the facts at issue here, we conclude that the neglect\n\nexhibited -- both by José Méndez before his death and by Roberto Méndez\n\nafterwards -- could fairly be termed inexcusable, and therefore that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Rule\n\n60(b) motion. See Ojeda-Toro v. Rivera-Méndez, 835 F.2d 25, 30 (1st\n\n\n\n\n9 Although Pioneer defined \"excusable neglect\" in the context of\nBankruptcy Rule 9006(b)(1), the case expressly indicated that the\nBankruptcy Rule definition paralleled that of Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 60(b)(1). Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 393.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fCir. 1988) (changes in counsel do not relieve litigant from liability\n\nfor previous counsel's inexcusable neglect).\n\n          First, before his death, José Méndez inexcusably failed to\n\ncommunicate with the federal district court, or keep the court\n\nappraised of the status of the case.         He had, since at least\n\nJanuary 28, 1998, been on notice that the case had been removed from\n\nthe Puerto Rico courts to the federal district court. At no point\n\nafter that date did Méndez inform the court that he was not admitted to\n\nfederal practice. Although he was aware that his second change of\n\naddress, to Box 270128, had been filed with the Bayamón court after\n\nthat court had dismissed the case, he failed to inform the federal\n\ncourt of his new address.    José Méndez also failed to respond to\n\ninterrogatories and discovery requests sent in February of 1998\n\n(although it is possible that he never received these requests, or did\n\nnot receive them in a timely fashion, due to the incorrect address used\n\nby defendants).\n\n          In short, between the time he received notice of the removal\n\nof this case in January 1998 and his death in April 1998, José Méndez\n\ndid virtually nothing to indicate his active prosecution of the case,\n\nother than contact Mendoza about the possibility of referral. An\n\nattorney has a duty of diligence to inquire about the status of a case.\n\nPryor v. United States Postal Serv., 769 F.2d 281, 287 (5th Cir. 1985).\n\nMoreover, it is an attorney's responsibility to alert the court as to\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fscheduling conflicts, and to explain absences or failures to appear in\n\na timely fashion. Kagan v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., 795 F.2d 601, 608\n\n(7th Cir. 1986). The failure to do so need not be excused under Rule\n\n60(b)(1). Id.; cf. Torre, 15 F.3d at 15 (litigant's failure to take\n\nsimple step of alerting court to ongoing negotiations and request\n\npostponement of imminent deadlines was inexcusable neglect).\n\n          Appellants make little or no attempt to explain the neglect\n\non the part of José Méndez, other than noting that he was not notified\n\nof the removal to federal district court until approximately two months\n\nafter it was filed, and that defendants sent post-removal notices to\n\nthe wrong address. These two facts do not automatically excuse his\n\ninexplicable refusal to conduct ordinary communication with the federal\n\ncourt. Certainly, the correspondence between José Méndez and Enrique\n\nMendoza, dated February 23, 1998, makes it evident that José Méndez was\n\nby February fully aware that the case had been removed to federal\n\ncourt, and that he had received at least the January 23, 1998 notice\n\n(originally sent to the incorrect address) that the United States had\n\nsubstituted as a party.10\n\n          Second, Roberto Méndez's incorrect \"assumption\" that Enrique\n\nMendoza had assumed responsibility for the representation was\n\n10 Drucker Shub's memorandum, attached to Mendoza's fax, posits a\nfactual scenario \"where a plaintiff files his or her claim in state\ncourt only later to have it removed to federal court, and the United\nStates is substituted as party defendant.\" Méndez had apparently been\naware of these relevant facts and briefed Mendoza on them.\n\n                                 -12-\n\finexcusable negligence. We sympathize with the fact that José Méndez's\n\ndeath was an undoubtedly disruptive event at Méndez & Méndez as well a\n\ndifficult personal loss for Roberto Méndez. However, a lawyer's duty\n\nof diligence transcends both upheaval at work and personal tragedy.\n\nSee Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 398 (\"In assessing the culpability of\n\nrespondents' counsel, we give little weight to the fact that counsel\n\nwas experiencing upheaval in his law practice at the time of the bar\n\ndate.\"); Miranda v. Am. Airlines, 176 F.R.D. 438, 440-41 (D.P.R. 1998)\n\n(personal problems of counsel do not constitute excusable neglect).\n\nAgain, an attorney has an ongoing responsibility to inquire into the\n\nstatus of a case.   Pryor, 769 F.2d at 287. Roberto Méndez was not\n\nrelieved of this responsibility because the case came to him after his\n\nbrother's untimely death; if anything, his lack of familiarity with the\n\nlitigation indicated a greater duty to ensure no deadlines were missed.\n\nFinally, having examined the record, we note that Méndez's claimed\n\nassumption was not a particularly reasonable one: the fact that Mendoza\n\nhad relayed a memorandum of law to José Méndez suggests that Méndez &\n\nMéndez still bore some responsibility for the litigation; the case file\n\nremained at the firm; there was no documentation of a change in\n\ncounsel; and there was no record that José Méndez had informed the\n\ndistrict court of any change in representation.\n\n          Appellants' reliance on the incorrect address used by\n\ndefendants (and perhaps by the district court) is unavailing for\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fseveral reasons. First, as we explained above, José Méndez's failure\n\nto communicate with the district court or alert defendants that they\n\nwere using the incorrect address is at least partly to blame for\n\ndefendants' continued use of Tropical #30. Second, appellants do not\n\nchallenge the representation that defendants had made over a dozen\n\nphone calls to Roberto Méndez's office regarding the failure to respond\n\nto discovery. Méndez admitted that he returned only one phone call\n\nbecause it was difficult for him to return phone calls during business\n\nhours. Third, as the district court noted, Dávila Alvarez, Civ. No.\n\n97-2793 (JAF), at 5-6, appellants' assertion that Méndez & Méndez did\n\nnot receive notices in a timely manner (if at all) is not entirely\n\ncredible. The record supports the inference that José Méndez received\n\nat least the United States' motion to substitute as a defendant.\n\nFurthermore, at no point has any lawyer associated with Méndez & Méndez\n\nstated in an affidavit that the firm never received the relevant\n\ndocuments. Although appellants claim, truthfully, that there is no\n\nevidence in the record that the documents were received, if any such\n\nevidence existed, it would be in the care of Méndez & Méndez.\n\n          Even if Méndez & Méndez never received many of the relevant\n\nmotions or notices from either defendants or the district court, we\n\nthink the facts in this case support the district court's holding.\n\nFirst, the record compels the conclusion that José Méndez was on notice\n\nof the removal of the case to federal court by January 28, 1998.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fSecond, once so informed, the confusion as to the correct firm address\n\ndid not relieve either Méndez brother of his responsibility to inform\n\nthe district court of the correct address and the fact that he was not\n\nadmitted to the federal bar. Upon his brother's death, Roberto Méndez\n\nhad a duty to make appropriate inquiries as to the status of the case,\n\neither by ensuring that replacement representation was in place or by\n\nfinding such representation. And at the very least, Roberto Méndez\n\nshould have returned the phone calls of opposing counsel. In short,\n\nJosé Méndez failed to undertake ordinary matters of diligent\n\nrepresentation and Roberto Méndez ignored the case for almost eight\n\nmonths based on an incorrect and unreasonable assumption; such overt\n\nneglect is hardly excusable even if a lawyer is preoccupied with other\n\nmatters. Torre, 15 F.3d at 15; Piñero Schroeder v. Fed. Nat'l Mortgage\n\nAss'n, 574 F.2d 1117, 1118 (1st Cir. 1978) (attorneys must organize\n\ntheir work so as to meet the time requirements of the matters they are\n\nhandling).\n\n           The other equitable factors do not point in appellants'\n\nfavor. This is not a case where a litigant missed deadlines by hours\n\nor days.   Cf. Denman v. Shubow, 413 F.2d 258, 259 (1st Cir. 1969)\n\n(counsel overslept and missed trial, but acted promptly to remedy the\n\nsituation). Roberto Méndez missed every discovery deadline and ignored\n\nthe existence of a pre-trial conference. Furthermore, almost eight\n\nmonths passed between José Méndez's death and Roberto Méndez's attempts\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fto remedy the situation. Finally, Roberto Méndez's failure to perform\n\nsimple acts of courtesy such as returning opposing counsel's phone\n\ncalls in a timely fashion calls his good faith seriously into question.\n\n           Appellants make a final plea that to dismiss the case based\n\non counsel's inexcusable conduct would work an unjust penalty on the\n\nlitigants.     The Supreme Court has clearly disavowed such an argument:\n\n           There is certainly no merit to the contention\n           that dismissal of petitioner's claim because of\n           his counsel's unexcused conduct imposes an unjust\n           penalty on the client. Petitioner voluntarily\n           chose this attorney as his representative in the\n           action, and he cannot now avoid the consequences\n           of the acts or omissions of this freely selected\n           agent.    Any other notion would be wholly\n           inconsistent with our system of representative\n           litigation, in which each party is deemed bound\n           by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered\n           to have \"notice of all facts, notice of which can\n           be charged upon the attorney.\"\n\nLink v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S. 626, 633-34 (1962) (quoting Smith v.\n\nAyer, 101 U.S. 320, 326 (1879)); see also Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 396\n\n(citing Link).\n\n           Appellants also seek relief under Rule 60(b)(6), which allows\n\na court to grant relief for \"any other reason [so] justifying.\" Rules\n\n60(b)(1) and 60(b)(6) are mutually exclusive, however, meaning that\n\nappellants are not entitled to relief under (b)(6) for claims of\n\nexcusable neglect. Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 393; Liljeberg v. Health\n\nServs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 863 & n.11 (1988). Moreover,\n\nto   justify   relief   under   Rule   60(b)(6),   \"a   party   must   show\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f'extraordinary circumstances' suggesting that the party is faultless in\n\nthe delay.\" Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 393; Ackerman v. United States, 340\n\nU.S. 193, 197-200 (1950); Klapprott v. United States, 335 U.S. 601,\n\n613-14 (1949). As we have explained at length, both José Méndez and\n\nRoberto Méndez were far from faultless in their conduct.\n\n          Appellants end with a last-ditch jurisdictional argument. In\n\ntheir reply brief, they admit that they failed to fulfill the\n\njurisdictional prerequisite of pursuing administrative remedies prior\n\nto filing a claim under the FTCA. They argue that this failure robbed\n\nthe district court of subject matter jurisdiction to enter judgment,\n\nand that we should direct the court to void the judgment and remand to\n\nthe Puerto Rico courts. Given that this issue was not raised before\n\nthe district court, and briefed only marginally here, we are loath to\n\naddress it at any length. We confine ourselves to two observations.\n\nFirst, a failure to comply with the exhaustion requirement would not\n\naffect the district court's jurisdiction over the action as a whole\n\n(and to the extent that it might have furnished an argument for remand,\n\nthat argument was waived by plaintiffs' failure to make a timely motion\n\nto that effect). Second, the exhaustion requirement is, in all events,\n\nintended for the government's protection, and, like most other\n\nexhaustion requirements, can be waived by the intended beneficiary.\n\nSince it is the plaintiffs, not the federal defendant, who attempt to\n\ninvoke exhaustion here, we conclude that the waiver doctrine applies\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fand that there was no jurisdictional impediment to the entry of\n\njudgment below.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -18-\n\f",

Plaintiffs-appellants1 Faustina\n\nDávila-Alvarez, Ramón Fernández, Rosa Alvarez-Oquendo and Rafael\n\nFernández filed the tort action underlying this appeal in the Puerto\n\nRico courts on November 7, 1995.       It was removed to the federal\n\ndistrict court for the District of Puerto Rico on November 25, 1997.\n\nOn April 12, 1998, plaintiffs' counsel, José Antonio Méndez Rodríguez\n\n(José Méndez), died suddenly and unexpectedly. His brother and law\n\npartner, Roberto Méndez Rodríguez (Roberto Méndez), assumed\n\nresponsibility for the case. After receiving no response to discovery\n\nrequests filed as early as February 1998, defendants moved for\n\ndismissal for lack of prosecution. The district court granted this\n\nmotion and dismissed with prejudice on December 14, 1998. Plaintiffs,\n\nrepresented by new counsel, sought relief from judgment under Federal\n\nRules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1) and 60(b)(6). The district court\n\ndenied this request. Dávila Alvarez v. Escuela de Medicina Universidad\n\nCentral del Caribe, Civ. No. 97-2793 (JAF) (D.P.R. Mar. 28, 2000).\n\nFinding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nrefusing to grant relief, we affirm.\n\n                             BACKGROUND\n\n\n\n\n1 Throughout the opinion we refer to plaintiffs-appellants Dávila-\nAlvarez, et. al., as either \"plaintiffs\" or \"appellants\" depending on\nthe stage of the litigation at issue.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          We present the procedural history of this litigation in some\n\ndetail, as it supports the district court's refusal to grant relief\n\nfrom judgment.\n\n          On November 7, 1995, plaintiffs filed this medical\n\nmalpractice claim in Bayamón Superior Court, a Puerto Rico court of\n\nfirst instance. José Méndez, of the law firm of Méndez & Méndez, was\n\ncounsel of record. The firm's address was listed with the court as\n\nTropical #30, Muñoz Rivera, Guaynabo, Puerto Rico. On July 23, 1996,\n\nJosé Méndez filed an Informative Motion in the Puerto Rico court noting\n\nchanges to the firm's street and mailing addresses.2 On November 25,\n\n1997, co-defendant3 Dr. Susana Schwartz removed the case to federal\n\ndistrict court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1442(a)(1), 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d),\n\nand 42 U.S.C. § 233.4 The notice of removal was served to José Méndez\n\nat his former address, Tropical #30.\n\n          Although the case had been removed to federal court and\n\ndismissed from the Puerto Rico courts, José Méndez filed a second\n\n\n\n2 The new street address was 1848 Glasgow Avenue, College Park, Rio\nPiedras, Puerto Rico. The new mailing address was P.O. Box 70150,\nSuite 128, San Juan, Puerto Rico.\n3 There is some dispute as to whether Dr. Schwartz should be considered\na co-defendant or a third-party defendant; for purposes of this appeal,\nthe distinction is irrelevant.\n4 Schwartz did so as an officer of the United States Department of\nHealth and Human Services who had obtained a certification from the\nUnited States Attorney that she was acting within the scope of her\nfederal employment at the time of the conduct complained of.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fInformative Motion in Bayamón Superior Court on January 13, 1998,\n\nnoting another change in the mailing address of Méndez & Méndez, to\n\nP.O. Box 270128, San Juan, Puerto Rico. Counsel for defendants were\n\nalso served with notice of the new address. On January 23, 1998, the\n\nBayamón Superior Court issued a Notice of Judgment to the correct Box\n\n270128 address, informing José Méndez that judgment had issued, and the\n\ncase dismissed from the Bayamón court, as of December 11, 1997. The\n\nDecember 11, 1997 dismissal order clearly stated that the case was\n\ndismissed under 28 U.S.C. § 1446, the federal removal statute. As\n\nappellants concede that José Méndez received the Notice of Judgment\n\nfrom the Bayamón Superior Court on January 28, 1998, he was on notice\n\nas of that date that the case had been dismissed from the Puerto Rico\n\ncourts because it had been removed to federal district court.\n\n          Also on January 23, 1998, the United States was substituted\n\nas defendant for Dr. Schwartz pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2679. Notice of\n\nthis substitution was sent by first-class mail to José Méndez at his\n\nformer address, Tropical #30. On February 2, 1998, the United States\n\nsubmitted a responsive pleading, which was again sent to the incorrect\n\nTropical #30 address. On February 3 and February 4, 1998, the United\n\nStates sent interrogatories and filed a request for the production of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdocuments, again to the wrong address. There is no evidence, for the\n\nmost part, that these documents ever arrived at Méndez & Méndez.5\n\n          Because José Méndez was not admitted to practice before the\n\nfederal court, at some point in January or February of 1998, he\n\ncontacted attorney Enrique Mendoza about the possibility of referring\n\nthe case. The record shows only that Mendoza solicited research on a\n\nrelevant legal issue from a third attorney.6 On February 23, 1998,\n\nMendoza faxed the results of this research to José Méndez. There is no\n\nevidence in the record that Mendoza accepted the referral, and no\n\nmotion was filed informing the district court of a change of counsel.\n\nJosé Méndez also did not inform the district court at this point that\n\nhe was not admitted to the federal bar.\n\n          On   April   12,   1998,    José   Méndez   died   suddenly   and\n\nunexpectedly. Upon his death, Roberto Méndez assumed responsibility\n\nfor all of his current cases. Roberto Méndez was also not admitted to\n\npractice before the federal court.\n\n\n\n5 There is strong circumstantial evidence that José Méndez received at\nleast the notice informing him of the United States' substitution as a\ndefendant in a timely fashion. His correspondence with Enrique Mendoza\nin early 1998 presented a fact scenario based on such a substitution.\nSee infra at n.10.\n6 After removing the case, the United States had claimed that the suit\nwas barred for failure to pursue administrative remedies required under\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA). Mendoza had asked attorney Lisa\nDrucker Shub to research whether, in a case where a plaintiff was\nunaware of defendant's federal employment status prior to removal, the\nstatute of limitations acted to bar an administrative claim.\n\n                                     -6-\n\f          On June 8, 1998, the district court issued a Scheduling Order\n\nproviding that the pleadings be finalized by July 17, 1998, that\n\ndiscovery be completed by October 8, 1998, and that any dispositive\n\nmotion be filed prior to November 9, 1998. A pretrial conference was\n\nscheduled for December 8, 1998. It is unclear from the record whether\n\nthe Order was sent to Méndez & Méndez at the Tropical #30 address or at\n\nthe correct Box 270128 address.7\n\n          On October 21, 1998, the United States filed a motion\n\nrequesting dismissal for want of prosecution, noting that its\n\ninterrogatories and requests for document production, propounded in\n\nFebruary of 1998, had gone unanswered, and that the time for discovery\n\nset forth in the Scheduling Order had elapsed. This motion was later\n\njoined by co-defendant Escuela de Medicina. Both motions were noticed\n\nto the now-deceased José Méndez at his Tropical #30 address. Counsel\n\nfor Escuela de Medicina also submitted an affidavit stating that he had\n\nleft more than a dozen phone messages for Roberto Méndez (both upon the\n\nJune receipt of the Scheduling Order and in the days prior to the\n\nDecember pre-trial conference) that had gone unreturned.            On\n\nDecember 8, 1998, the motion for dismissal was granted. Judgment was\n\nentered as of December 14, 1998.\n\n\n\n7 A copy of the civil docket included in the appendices indicates that,\nas of July 11, 2000, the district court had the Tropical #30 address on\nfile for José Méndez and the P.O. Box 270128 on file for both the law\nfirm Méndez & Méndez and for Roberto Méndez.\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          Between José Méndez's death on April 12, 1998 and December\n\n3, 1998, Roberto Méndez took no action regarding this case.         On\n\nDecember 3, 1998, he forwarded a \"cross-claimant complaint\" to Mendoza.\n\nThe same day, Mendoza responded that he \"really [had] no interest in\n\nparticipating in this case.\" On December 15, 1998, a day after the\n\ndistrict court had entered judgment, Roberto Méndez asked the court for\n\na thirty day extension in order to find new representation for\n\nplaintiffs.   In his request, Méndez claimed that until receiving\n\nMendoza's December 3 fax disclaiming any responsibility for the\n\nlitigation, it had been his understanding that Mendoza had assumed\n\nrepresentation prior to José Méndez's death.\n\n          New counsel for plaintiffs sought relief from judgment on\n\nthis basis in a Rule 60(b) motion filed January 19, 1999. The district\n\ncourt denied the motion in an Opinion and Order dated March 28, 2000.\n\nIn particular, the court noted that: (i) Roberto Méndez had\n\ninexplicably failed to notify the district court of the death of José\n\nMéndez; (ii) instead of making the incorrect assumption that Enrique\n\nMendoza had assumed responsibility for the case, Roberto Méndez \"should\n\nhave assured himself of this fact\"; (iii) the multiple messages left by\n\ndefendants with the secretary at Méndez & Méndez should have alerted\n\nRoberto Méndez to the imminent expiration of the time for discovery;\n\n(iv) although the Rule 60(b) petition focused on the incorrect address\n\nused by defendants (and perhaps the court), at no point did appellants'\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcounsel affirmatively state that Méndez & Méndez had failed to receive\n\nthe relevant motions and notices at the firm's new address; and (v)\n\nJosé Méndez should have filed a change of address form with the federal\n\ncourt after receiving notice of removal. A subsequent request for\n\nreconsideration was denied on May 25, 2000.        This appeal followed.\n\n                             DISCUSSION\n\n          Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(1) allows the court to\n\nrelieve a party from a final judgment for \"mistake, inadvertence,\n\nsurprise, or excusable neglect.\" As motions brought under Rule 60(b)\n\nare \"committed to the court's sound discretion,\" we review here only to\n\ndetermine if the district court abused its discretion in refusing to\n\ngrant appellants' motion.

Id. at 395.\n\nAfter considering the facts at issue here, we conclude that the neglect\n\nexhibited -- both by José Méndez before his death and by Roberto Méndez\n\nafterwards -- could fairly be termed inexcusable, and therefore that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Rule\n\n60(b) motion.

He had, since at least\n\nJanuary 28, 1998, been on notice that the case had been removed from\n\nthe Puerto Rico courts to the federal district court. At no point\n\nafter that date did Méndez inform the court that he was not admitted to\n\nfederal practice. Although he was aware that his second change of\n\naddress, to Box 270128, had been filed with the Bayamón court after\n\nthat court had dismissed the case, he failed to inform the federal\n\ncourt of his new address.    José Méndez also failed to respond to\n\ninterrogatories and discovery requests sent in February of 1998\n\n(although it is possible that he never received these requests, or did\n\nnot receive them in a timely fashion, due to the incorrect address used\n\nby defendants).\n\n          In short, between the time he received notice of the removal\n\nof this case in January 1998 and his death in April 1998, José Méndez\n\ndid virtually nothing to indicate his active prosecution of the case,\n\nother than contact Mendoza about the possibility of referral.

Torre, 15 F.3d at 15 (litigant's failure to take\n\nsimple step of alerting court to ongoing negotiations and request\n\npostponement of imminent deadlines was inexcusable neglect).\n\n          Appellants make little or no attempt to explain the neglect\n\non the part of José Méndez, other than noting that he was not notified\n\nof the removal to federal district court until approximately two months\n\nafter it was filed, and that defendants sent post-removal notices to\n\nthe wrong address. These two facts do not automatically excuse his\n\ninexplicable refusal to conduct ordinary communication with the federal\n\ncourt. Certainly, the correspondence between José Méndez and Enrique\n\nMendoza, dated February 23, 1998, makes it evident that José Méndez was\n\nby February fully aware that the case had been removed to federal\n\ncourt, and that he had received at least the January 23, 1998 notice\n\n(originally sent to the incorrect address) that the United States had\n\nsubstituted as a party.10\n\n          Second, Roberto Méndez's incorrect \"assumption\" that Enrique\n\nMendoza had assumed responsibility for the representation was\n\n10 Drucker Shub's memorandum, attached to Mendoza's fax, posits a\nfactual scenario \"where a plaintiff files his or her claim in state\ncourt only later to have it removed to federal court, and the United\nStates is substituted as party defendant.\" Méndez had apparently been\naware of these relevant facts and briefed Mendoza on them.\n\n                                 -12-\n\finexcusable negligence. We sympathize with the fact that José Méndez's\n\ndeath was an undoubtedly disruptive event at Méndez & Méndez as well a\n\ndifficult personal loss for Roberto Méndez. However, a lawyer's duty\n\nof diligence transcends both upheaval at work and personal tragedy.\n\nSee Pioneer, 507 U.S. at 398 (\"In assessing the culpability of\n\nrespondents' counsel, we give little weight to the fact that counsel\n\nwas experiencing upheaval in his law practice at the time of the bar\n\ndate.\"); Miranda v. Am. Airlines, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440-41 (D.P.R. 1998)\n\n(personal problems of counsel do not constitute excusable neglect).\n\nAgain, an attorney has an ongoing responsibility to inquire into the\n\nstatus of a case.   Pryor, 769 F.2d at 287. Roberto Méndez was not\n\nrelieved of this responsibility because the case came to him after his\n\nbrother's untimely death; if anything, his lack of familiarity with the\n\nlitigation indicated a greater duty to ensure no deadlines were missed.\n\nFinally, having examined the record, we note that Méndez's claimed\n\nassumption was not a particularly reasonable one: the fact that Mendoza\n\nhad relayed a memorandum of law to José Méndez suggests that Méndez &\n\nMéndez still bore some responsibility for the litigation; the case file\n\nremained at the firm; there was no documentation of a change in\n\ncounsel; and there was no record that José Méndez had informed the\n\ndistrict court of any change in representation.\n\n          Appellants' reliance on the incorrect address used by\n\ndefendants (and perhaps by the district court) is unavailing for\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fseveral reasons. First, as we explained above, José Méndez's failure\n\nto communicate with the district court or alert defendants that they\n\nwere using the incorrect address is at least partly to blame for\n\ndefendants' continued use of Tropical #30. Second, appellants do not\n\nchallenge the representation that defendants had made over a dozen\n\nphone calls to Roberto Méndez's office regarding the failure to respond\n\nto discovery. Méndez admitted that he returned only one phone call\n\nbecause it was difficult for him to return phone calls during business\n\nhours. Third, as the district court noted, Dávila Alvarez, Civ. No.\n\n97-2793 (JAF), at 5-6, appellants' assertion that Méndez & Méndez did\n\nnot receive notices in a timely manner (if at all) is not entirely\n\ncredible. The record supports the inference that José Méndez received\n\nat least the United States' motion to substitute as a defendant.\n\nFurthermore, at no point has any lawyer associated with Méndez & Méndez\n\nstated in an affidavit that the firm never received the relevant\n\ndocuments. Although appellants claim, truthfully, that there is no\n\nevidence in the record that the documents were received, if any such\n\nevidence existed, it would be in the care of Méndez & Méndez.\n\n          Even if Méndez & Méndez never received many of the relevant\n\nmotions or notices from either defendants or the district court, we\n\nthink the facts in this case support the district court's holding.\n\nFirst, the record compels the conclusion that José Méndez was on notice\n\nof the removal of the case to federal court by January 28, 1998.\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\fSecond, once so informed, the confusion as to the correct firm address\n\ndid not relieve either Méndez brother of his responsibility to inform\n\nthe district court of the correct address and the fact that he was not\n\nadmitted to the federal bar. Upon his brother's death, Roberto Méndez\n\nhad a duty to make appropriate inquiries as to the status of the case,\n\neither by ensuring that replacement representation was in place or by\n\nfinding such representation. And at the very least, Roberto Méndez\n\nshould have returned the phone calls of opposing counsel. In short,\n\nJosé Méndez failed to undertake ordinary matters of diligent\n\nrepresentation and Roberto Méndez ignored the case for almost eight\n\nmonths based on an incorrect and unreasonable assumption; such overt\n\nneglect is hardly excusable even if a lawyer is preoccupied with other\n\nmatters.

Nat'l Mortgage\n\nAss'n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"355342\"><a href=\"/opinion/355342/vicente-pinero-schroeder-v-federal-national-mortgage-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">574</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1118 (1st Cir. 1978) (attorneys must organize\n\ntheir work so as to meet the time requirements of the matters they are\n\nhandling).\n\n           The other equitable factors do not point in appellants'\n\nfavor. This is not a case where a litigant missed deadlines by hours\n\nor days.   Cf. Denman v. Shubow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"285624\"><a href=\"/opinion/285624/nathaniel-a-denman-v-lawrence-shubow/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 259 (1st Cir. 1969)\n\n(counsel overslept and missed trial, but acted promptly to remedy the\n\nsituation). Roberto Méndez missed every discovery deadline and ignored\n\nthe existence of a pre-trial conference. Furthermore, almost eight\n\nmonths passed between José Méndez's death and Roberto Méndez's attempts\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fto remedy the situation. Finally, Roberto Méndez's failure to perform\n\nsimple acts of courtesy such as returning opposing counsel's phone\n\ncalls in a timely fashion calls his good faith seriously into question.\n\n           Appellants make a final plea that to dismiss the case based\n\non counsel's inexcusable conduct would work an unjust penalty on the\n\nlitigants.     The Supreme Court has clearly disavowed such an argument:\n\n           There is certainly no merit to the contention\n           that dismissal of petitioner's claim because of\n           his counsel's unexcused conduct imposes an unjust\n           penalty on the client. Petitioner voluntarily\n           chose this attorney as his representative in the\n           action, and he cannot now avoid the consequences\n           of the acts or omissions of this freely selected\n           agent.    Any other notion would be wholly\n           inconsistent with our system of representative\n           litigation, in which each party is deemed bound\n           by the acts of his lawyer-agent and is considered\n           to have \"notice of all facts, notice of which can\n           be charged upon the attorney.\"\n\nLink v.

As we have explained at length, both José Méndez and\n\nRoberto Méndez were far from faultless in their conduct.\n\n          Appellants end with a last-ditch jurisdictional argument. In\n\ntheir reply brief, they admit that they failed to fulfill the\n\njurisdictional prerequisite of pursuing administrative remedies prior\n\nto filing a claim under the FTCA. They argue that this failure robbed\n\nthe district court of subject matter jurisdiction to enter judgment,\n\nand that we should direct the court to void the judgment and remand to\n\nthe Puerto Rico courts. Given that this issue was not raised before\n\nthe district court, and briefed only marginally here, we are loath to\n\naddress it at any length. We confine ourselves to two observations.\n\nFirst, a failure to comply with the exhaustion requirement would not\n\naffect the district court's jurisdiction over the action as a whole\n\n(and to the extent that it might have furnished an argument for remand,\n\nthat argument was waived by plaintiffs' failure to make a timely motion\n\nto that effect). Second, the exhaustion requirement is, in all events,\n\nintended for the government's protection, and, like most other\n\nexhaustion requirements, can be waived by the intended beneficiary.\n\nSince it is the plaintiffs, not the federal defendant, who attempt to\n\ninvoke exhaustion here, we conclude that the waiver doctrine applies\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fand that there was no jurisdictional impediment to the entry of\n\njudgment below.\n\n         Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -18-\n\f</pre>",
