Gilberto Cowo, a citizen of Belize,\n\nappeals from the district court’s denial of his motion to\n\nsuppress all statements and evidence obtained from him at\n\nthe time of his arrest on the ground that he was not\n\ninformed at that time of his right to consular notification,\n\npursuant to Article 36 of the Vienna Convention on Consular\n\nRelations, April 24, 1963, 21 U.S.T. 77, 596 U.N.T.S. 261,\n\n1967 WL 18349 (ratified November 24, 1969) (the “Vienna\n\nConvention”).    Cowo seeks to have his conviction vacated and\n\nto be deported to Belize or, in the alternative, to have the\n\ncase remanded for the district court to make a determination\n\nof whether he was prejudiced by the failure to be informed\n\nof his right to consular notification.\n\n          We need not decide whether the failure to inform\n\nCowo at the time of his arrest of his right to consular\n\nnotification violated the Vienna Convention.             The district\n\ncourt did not err in denying Cowo’s motion to suppress.\n\nThis   court   recently    held   in   an   en   banc   decision   that\n\n“irrespective of whether or not the [Vienna Convention]\n\ncreate[s] individual rights to consular notification, the\n\nappropriate remedies do not include suppression of evidence\n\nor dismissal of the indictment.” United States v. Li, 206\n\fF.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 956\n\n(2000).   Cowo argues that Li was wrongly decided. “Even if\n\nwe assume, for argument’s sake, that in some extraordinary\n\ncircumstance a panel might be warranted in declaring an\n\nearlier en banc decision obsolete and refusing to follow it,\n\nthe appellant has offered no adequate justification for\n\napplying such a long-odds exception here.” Stewart v.
