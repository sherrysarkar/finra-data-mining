The plaintiffs  Peter Zanni  and\r\n\nRoma  entered into a  real estate development  venture with Harry\r\n\nand  Russell  DePetrillo (\"the  DePetrillos\").    Unknown to  the\r\n\nplaintiffs, the DePetrillos had  entered into an arrangement with\r\n\nthe alleged de facto government of  the Town, with aRusso as \"the\r\n\nBoss,\" under which payments  would be made to this  enterprise in\r\n\norder to obtain necessary approvals.  After the DePetrillos  sold\r\n\ntheir share, Peter  Zanni was informed of  this preexisting deal,\r\n\nand was  warned that his  project was \"dead\"  if he did  not make\r\n\npayments.  Having invested heavily in the project, and reasonably\r\n\nbelieving that he was dealing with a racketeering enterprise that\r\n\nhad extorted and stolen for years during its control of the Town,\r\n\nPeter Zanni paid up.  He  continued paying for three years, until\r\n\nhe  was  able to  sell his  share of  the  development.   He then\r\n\ninformed the FBI, and cooperated with its investigation and later\r\n\nwith prosecutions of official corruption in the Town.\r\n\n          Peter Zanni  and Roma  brought federal and  state civil\r\n\nracketeering  claims and  federal civil  rights  claims, charging\r\n\nthat they were  injured by the conduct  of aRusso and his  fellow\r\n\nindividual defendants, as well  as the Town.  The  district court\r\n\ndismissed these charges on  the grounds that the plaintiffs'  own\r\n\nconduct rendered them unable to maintain  standing to press their\r\n\nclaims.     The  plaintiffs   appeal  the  dismissals   of  their\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nracketeering1 and civil  rights claims, as  well as the  district\r\n\ncourt's  decision to  deny the  pro hac  vice admission  of their\r                                                       \r\n\ndesired counsel, G.

DISCUSSION\r\n\n          We  address  first  the  plaintiffs'  challenge  to the\r\n\ndismissals  of their  causes of  action, and then  confront their\r\n\nappeal  of  the district  court's decision  to deny  admission to\r\n\nBlakey.\r\n\n                       A.

Causes of Action\r\n\n          After setting forth the applicable  standard of review,\r\n\nwe  turn  first to  the  plaintiffs'  challenge to  the  district\r\n\ncourt's dismissal of their racketeering claims.  We then shift to\r\n\nthe issue of the plaintiffs' section 1983 claims.\r\n\n                      1.  Standard of Review\r                                1.  Standard of Review\r\n\n          Upon  considering a  motion to  dismiss for  failure to\r\n\nstate a claim under Fed. R.  Civ. P. 12(b)(6), the district court\r\n\nshould not grant the motion unless it appears to a certainty that\r\n\nthe plaintiff  would be unable to recover under any set of facts.\r\n\nHospital Bldg.

Plaintiffs also stipulated\r\nthat they would  not attempt  to assert such  claims against  the\r\nTown  in the future.   Accordingly, vis-a-vis the  Town, the only\r\ndamage claims we address are those pursuant to section 1983.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n                   2.  The Racketeering Claims\r                             2.  The Racketeering Claims\r\n\n          RICO creates  a civil remedy for  \"[a]ny person injured\r\n\nin his business or property  by reason of a violation of  section\r\n\n1962  of this chapter.\"  18 U.S.C.    1964(c).  Subsection (c) of\r\n\nsection  1962, in  turn, declares  that it  is unlawful  \"for any\r\n\nperson employed  by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,\r\n\nor  the  activities  of   which  affect,  interstate  or  foreign\r\n\ncommerce, to  conduct or participate, directly  or indirectly, in\r\n\nthe conduct  of such  enterprise's affairs  through a  pattern of\r\n\nracketeering  activity or  collection of unlawful  debt.\"   Id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1962(c).  An \"enterprise\" is  defined to include \"any individual,\r\n\npartnership, corporation, association or other legal entity,  and\r\n\nany union or group of individuals associated in fact although not\r\n\na legal entity.\"  Id.   1961(4). \"Racketeering activity\" includes\r                               \r\n\nany  one of a number of enumerated criminal acts indictable under\r\n\nfederal  or  state law.    See id.     1961(1).   A  \"'pattern of\r                                            \r\n\nracketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering\r\n\nactivity . . . the last of which  occurred within ten years . . .\r\n\nafter the commission  of a prior  act of racketeering  activity.\"\r\n\nId.   1961(5).\r             \r\n\n          The district court dismissed the plaintiffs' civil RICO\r\n\nclaims on  the ground  that, by  their own pleadings,  plaintiffs\r\n\nwere not innocent victims and therefore could  not maintain civil\r\n\nRICO  standing.    The  district  court  found  support  for  the\r\n\nproposition that only innocent  victims could collect damages via\r\n\ncivil  RICO in  the legislative  history of  the provision.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nOrganized Crime Control:  Hearings on S.  30 Before the  Subcomm.\r                                                                           \r\n\nNo. 5 of the  House Committee on the  Judiciary, 91st Cong.,  2d.\r                                                         \r\n\nSess. (1970) (stating, in the Act's \"Findings and  Purpose,\" that\r\n\n\"Congress finds that . . . organized crime activity in the United\r\n\nStates  harms innocent  investors and  competing organizations\");\r\n\n116  Cong. Rec.  H35,346-47  (Oct. 7,  1970)  (statement of  Rep.\r\n\nSteiger, the  private civil  remedy provision's sponsor)  (\"It is\r\n\nthe  intent of  this body,  I am  certain, to  see that  innocent\r\n\nparties who are  the victims of  organized crime have a  right to\r\n\nobtain proper redress.\").  The district court's reasoning can  be\r\n\nbetter delineated in conjunction with a recitation of plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaims.   Drawing inferences  in favor of  the plaintiffs,  their\r\n\npleadings suggest the following situation.  The plaintiffs joined\r\n\nthe  DePetrillos  in  a  real estate  venture,  unaware  that the\r\n\nDePetrillos  had  entered  into  a  scheme  in  which  regulatory\r\n\napprovals  had   already  been   granted  in  exchange   for  the\r\n\nDePetrillos'  payment  of $10,000  to  aRusso  and his  purported\r\n\nassociates.    The plaintiffs  were  similarly  unaware that  the\r\n\nDePetrillos  had agreed  to pay an  additional $40,000.   Several\r\n\nyears  later, defendant Councilman Benjamin Zanni approached them\r\n\nfor  the  purported  \"balance  due.\"    As  the   district  court\r\n\nemphasized,  the plaintiffs  then faced  a dilemma.    They could\r\n\nrefuse  to pay, jeopardizing  their $2 million  investment in the\r\n\nproject,  and   as  the   district  court  suggested   was  their\r\n\nobligation, go immediately  to the authorities.   Or, they  could\r\n\nsubmit to this extortion to protect their investment.  They chose\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthe latter route.   The plaintiffs state that they  complied with\r\n\nall  rules  and  regulations,   and  did  not  seek  preferential\r\n\ntreatment,  but  paid to  avoid threatened  adverse consequences.\r\n\nSpecifically,  the plaintiffs point  to Benjamin  Zanni's alleged\r\n\nstatement  to Plaintiff Peter  Zanni that the  venture was \"dead\"\r\n\nunless the balance was paid.  Three years later,  after they sold\r\n\ntheir  partnership  interests  in  the  venture,  the  plaintiffs\r\n\ncontacted the FBI, and assisted agents in a sting operation.\r\n\n          Looking at these contentions, one reasonable conclusion\r\n\nis  that the plaintiffs made these payments without any intent or\r\n\ndesire to  subvert governmental processes, but  felt compelled to\r\n\npay  to protect their substantial investment  in the venture, and\r\n\ndid  not contact the FBI until they  had mitigated risks to their\r\n\ninvestment.   However,  the district  court concluded  that, even\r\n\nunder this favorable view  of the plaintiffs' conduct they  could\r\n\nnot be considered innocent  parties, and so could  not, according\r\n\nto the district court's interpretation of RICO standing, maintain\r\n\na civil RICO claim.  The district court concluded that, since the\r\n\nplaintiffs' own pleadings indicate that they paid $40,000 to  the\r\n\nindividual defendants to assure  timely processing of permits and\r\n\napprovals  necessary  for  their  project,  the  plaintiffs  were\r\n\n\"neither  innocent nor victims.\"  Roma Constr. Co. v. aRusso, 906\r                                                                      \r\n\nF. Supp. 78, 82 (D.R.I. 1995).\r\n\n          The plaintiffs challenge the district court's dismissal\r\n\nof  their civil RICO claims on the pleadings.  Plaintiffs dispute\r\n\nthat  there is any \"innocent  party\" requirement under  RICO.

The district court did not refer  to, and we\r\n\nfail  to find, any Rhode  Island authority for  direction on this\r\n\npoint.\r\n\n          Rather, the  district court  drew on the  commentary to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nundeveloped record  presently before  the court.   The concurring\r\nopinion hypothesizes that the substance of any such defense would\r\nbe informed by preexisting  federal statutes embodying comparable\r\ndefenses.   By contrast,  the district court's  dismissal depends\r\nentirely  on  the  existence,  vel  non,  of either  an  absolute\r                                                 \r\ninnocent-victim \"standing\"  requirement or  a  law-based in  pari\r                                                                           \r\ndelicto  defense,  each of  which, by  its  very nature,  is more\r                 \r\nreadily susceptible  to summary disposition than a fact-intensive\r\n\"equal involvement\" defense.   Thus  we caution  that nothing  we\r\nhave  said is meant to  suggest that Congress  intended to create\r\neither  such  a \"standing\"  requirement  or  an  in pari  delicto\r                                                                           \r\ndefense.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthe Model Penal Code's definition of bribery to conclude that the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  payments, even  if construed  to be  the product  of\r\n\ncoercion, constituted illegal bribery.

The district  court suggested that  the\r\n\nCongress that enacted RICO in  1970, which referred obliquely  in\r\n\nlegislative history to the  purpose of aiding \"innocent parties,\"\r\n\nwould be cognizant of the emerging Model Penal  Code trend in the\r\n\nlaw  of bribery, presupposing that Congress gave courts the power\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nto develop substantive law regarding this issue.\r\n\n          We find  no evidence  of any congressional  intent that\r\n\nthe \"innocence\"  of a RICO \"victim\"  should be made to  turn on a\r\n\nuniform federal common  law rule.

The plaintiffs claim  that they paid\r\n\nonly to avoid adverse consequences, that their properties met the\r\n\nstandards required for  the approvals in question,  and that they\r\n\nreceived nothing  beyond fair  treatment from payees.   Examining\r\n\nthese claims  with an  eye towards  detecting corrupt intent,  we\r\n\nthink  that a set of facts could  be found from which it could be\r\n\nreasonably  inferred that  the plaintiffs  did not  make payments\r\n\nvoluntarily to bring about an unlawful result, with the hope of a\r\n\ngain for  themselves,  but rather  that  they were  the  innocent\r\n\nvictims of  a criminal enterprise.  As a result, we conclude that\r\n\nRhode Island's  bribery statute  does not foreclose  a conclusion\r\n\nthat they are \"innocent parties.\"\r\n\n          Citing  United States  v.

However,\r                                              \r\n\nwe  think  these cases  unavailing  for  three  reasons.   First,\r\n\n                               -18-\r\r\n\nneither deals with Rhode Island's bribery statute.  Second,  even\r\n\nif these cases compelled us to conclude that bribery and coercive\r\n\nextortion are  not mutually  exclusive concepts under  the Rhodes\r\n\nIsland statute, in the  instant case a genuine issue  of material\r\n\nfact  remains as to  the plaintiffs'  intent in  making payments,\r\n\nbased on  a reading of  the pleadings in  the best light  for the\r\n\nplaintiffs.\r\n\n          Third,  and finally,  Mariano, at  least, involved  two\r                                                 \r\n\ndefendants  who  pled  guilty  to   \"corruptly  giv[ing]  .  .  .\r\n\n[some]thing of value\" to  local government officials \"with intent\r\n\nto influence or reward\" those officials, where the officials were\r\n\npart  of a  governmental unit  that received  substantial federal\r\n\nsubsidies, in violation of  18 U.S.C.   666(a)(2).

On appeal, both defendants challenged the district\r\n\ncourt's  application  of  the sentencing  guideline  relating  to\r\n\nbribery  rather than  the guideline  appropriate to  providing an\r\n\nillegal gratuity.   Id. at  1159.   They argued  that \"they  were\r                                 \r\n\nvictims, not  perpetrators, of  an extortionate scheme,  and that\r\n\nthey  received nothing  extra  in return.\"    Id.

In particular, we\r                 \r\n\nnoted that the Mariano defendants could not \"expect the courts to\r                                \r\n\n                               -19-\r\r\n\nswallow their tale uncritically.\"  Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1160.\r                                                    \r\n\n          In this  case, the district court  improperly dismissed\r\n\nthe plaintiffs' case before it had a chance to swallow, let alone\r\n\ndigest,  their story.    At this  stage  of the  game,  since one\r\n\nplausible view is  that the  plaintiffs were in  fact victims  of\r\n\ncoercive  extortion, and  since they  have not  pled guilty  to a\r\n\ncrime that involves \"corrupt intent\" as an element as we noted of\r\n\nthe defendants in Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1159, we conclude that the\r                                   \r\n\nplaintiffs in the instant case may press on with their claim.  As\r\n\na  result, we  reverse  the  district  court's dismissal  of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' federal  RICO claims.   Accordingly, we  also reverse\r\n\nthe  district   court's  dismissal  for   lack  of   supplemental\r\n\njurisdiction, see 28 U.S.C.   1367, of state RICO claims pursuant\r                           \r\n\nto R.I.

See R.I. Gen.

Thus, we  conclude that the plaintiffs could  show a\r\n\ndirect causal link between the defendants' coercive extortion and\r\n\nthe plaintiffs' losses.\r\n\n          As  a  result,  we  turn  to the  question  of  whether\r\n\ncoercive  extortion, if  found, could  be  attributed to  some de\r                                                                           \r\n\nfacto municipal  policy.   \"An unconstitutional policy  or custom\r               \r\n\nmay be inferred from  a single decision  or act .  . .

While a  showing that\r\n\naRusso acted illegally in the exercise of his discretion as Mayor\r\n\nmight  not by itself give  rise to municipal  liability, we think\r\n\nthat under  these pleadings, the plaintiffs could  indeed prove a\r\n\nset  of  facts  from  which  a  trier  of  fact  could  infer  an\r\n\nunconstitutional  policy or  custom  with respect  to the  Town's\r\n\ngovernment.    For example,  a  fact finder  could  conclude that\r\n\nextortion of  outsiders, businessmen,  or developers, if  proven,\r\n\nwas \"'the way  things are done and have been  done'\" in the Town.\r\n\nSee Kibbe  v.

The district court denied the motion  on\r                                \r\n\nJune  2,  1995.   On  June  12,  1995, the  plaintiffs  moved for\r\n\nreconsideration of  the court's order; the  district court denied\r\n\nthe motion for reconsideration on September 25, 1995.\r\n\n          The district court articulated two grounds for  denying\r\n\nBlakey's pro hac vice admission.  First, the district court noted\r                               \r\n\nthat a previous  motion by the  plaintiffs seeking the  admission\r\n\npro  hac vice of another of their attorneys, Spaloss, had already\r                       \r\n\nbeen granted.  Second, the district court expressed concern about\r\n\nthe amount of attorney's fees being generated by the plaintiffs.5\r\n\n          The Supreme Court has recognized that \"in many District\r\n\nCourts, the decision  on whether to grant pro  hac vice status to\r                                                                 \r\n\nan out-of-state  attorney is  purely discretionary.\"   Frazier v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nHeebe,  482 U.S. 641, 651  n.13 (1987).   However, the plaintiffs\r               \r\n\nargue  that the  U.S. District  Court for  the District  of Rhode\r\n\nIsland is  not one  of  those courts.   Local  Rule  5(c) of  the\r\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island provides in pertinent part that\r\n\n            [a]ny  attorney who is  a member  in good\r\n            standing of the bar  of the United States\r\n            Supreme Court, of any other United States\r\n            District court,  or of the  highest court\r\n            of   any  state,   shall  on   motion  be\r                                                               \r\n            permitted  to appear  once in  a calendar\r                                          \r\n            year in a case  or group of related cases\r\n            in  association with a  member of the bar\r\n            of this court who  is actively engaged in\r\n            the practice  of law within  the State of\r\n            Rhode Island . . . .\r\n\nD.R.I.

The plaintiffs  argue that in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n5   A  successful  civil RICO  plaintiff  may collect  reasonable\r\nattorney's fees  in  addition  to  treble  damages.    18  U.S.C.\r\n  1964(c).   \r\n\n                               -25-\r\r\n\ncontrast  to the  Local  Rules of  the  other districts  in  this\r\n\ncircuit,  Rhode Island's rule does  not by its  terms provide for\r\n\nthe court's discretion.  Compare D.R.I. R. 5(c) (\"shall on motion\r                                          \r\n\nbe  permitted to  appear\") with  D. Me.

R. 5(b)  (\"may at the discretion of  the court\");\r\n\nD.P.R. R. 204.2 (\"may be permitted\").  The plaintiffs assert that\r\n\nthe District of Rhode  Island has promulgated a rule  under whose\r\n\nclear language pro hac vice admission is not discretionary.  As a\r                                     \r\n\nresult,  the plaintiffs  claim,  the district  court  erred as  a\r\n\nmatter  of law  in  concluding that  it  had discretion  to  deny\r\n\nBlakey's pro  hac vice admission, or  alternatively, the district\r                                \r\n\ncourt abused whatever discretion it had.\r\n\n          We  do not consider the  issue of whether  this pro hac\r                                                                           \r\n\nvice rule, which may be nondiscretionary, nonetheless leaves some\r              \r\n\ndiscretion  to deny  admission.   Even  assuming that  discretion\r\n\nexisted, the district court's denial of such admission to  Blakey\r\n\nwas  an abuse  of  that discretion.    The district  court's  two\r\n\narticulated  grounds  simply  cannot  support its  action.    The\r\n\ndistrict court stated that \"[w]e already have  one pro hac vice .\r                                                                         \r\n\n. .

The  question is, concededly, one of  first impression\r\n\nhere.  Because  I analyze  the matter differently  than does  the\r\n\nmajority, I write separately.\r\n\n          The question of who has standing to bring actions under\r\n\nRICO is a matter of federal law.  The pertinent provision of RICO\r\n\nprovides:\r\n\n            Any  person injured  in  his business  or\r\n            property  by  reason  of  a  violation of\r\n            section  1962 of  this  chapter  may  sue\r\n            therefor in any appropriate United States\r\n            district   court    and   shall   recover\r\n            threefold the damages he sustains and the\r\n            cost of the  suit, including a reasonable\r\n            attorney's fee.  \r\n\n18 U.S.C.    1964(c).   There is no  qualification on  the phrase\r\n\n\"any  person injured  in his business  or property\"  limiting the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   At oral argument, plaintiffs stipulated that their RICO claim\r\nis not asserted against the town, but only against the individual\r\ndefendants.\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nphrase  to \"innocent\" persons.   RICO defines a  \"person\" as \"any\r\n\nindividual or  entity capable  of holding  a legal  or beneficial\r\n\ninterest in property.\"  18 U.S.C.    1961(3).  On the language of\r\n\nthe statute, plaintiffs meet this definition.8\r\n\n          In general,  the intent  of Congress manifested  in the\r\n\ntext of the statute governs the issue of standing:\r\n\n            In determining the scope of a statute, we\r\n            look  first  to  its  language.   If  the\r\n            statutory language is unambiguous, in the\r\n            absence    of   \"a    clearly   expressed\r\n            legislative intent to the  contrary, that\r\n            language must ordinarily  be regarded  as\r\n            conclusive.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v.

The language  of  RICO should  thus  be the\r\n\nprimary guide  to determining  Congressional intent.

Rec. 35,346-47  (1970).   That  statement was  made during\r\ndebate  over  a proposed  amendment, ultimately  withdrawn, which\r\nwould have authorized private injunctive relief.  See Abrams, The\r                                                                           \r\nLaw of  Civil RICO    1.4,  at 30 (1991).   The  district court's\r                            \r\ncharacterization  of the remarks  as coming from  \"the sponsor of\r\nthe  provision that  eventually created  a private  civil remedy\"\r\ncould cause a  misapprehension.   In fact, RICO  originated in  a\r\nbill filed  in  the Senate,  S.  30.   By  October 7,  1970,  the\r\nJudiciary  Committee had  already reported  out that  bill, which\r\nincluded  \"the  RICO  provision  ultimately  enacted  as  section\r\n1964(c), which  created a treble damage remedy.\"  Id. at 30.

This\r                                         \r\n\nselection from the legislative  history cannot overcome the plain\r\n\ntext of RICO, which is unambiguous.  It represents \"a rather thin\r\n\nreed upon which to base a requirement . . . neither expressed nor\r\n\n.  . .  fairly  implied in  the  operative sections  of  [RICO].\"\r\n\nScheidler, 510 U.S. at 805.  Even were there occasion to consider\r                   \r\n\nthe  legislative history  relied upon by  the district  court, it\r\n\nsays only  that the  statute will  protect innocent  victims, not\r\n\nthat the statute will deny standing to those who are not innocent\r\n\nvictims.   See Turkette, 452  U.S. at 591  (noting that \"negative\r                                 \r\n\ninference[s]\"  need  not be  drawn  from  positive statements  in\r\n\nlegislative history).\r\n\n          The  Supreme Court  has emphasized  the broad  reach of\r\n\nRICO's  language:   \"If  the defendant  engages  in a  pattern of\r\n\nracketeering  activity  . .  .  and  the racketeering  activities\r\n\ninjure the  plaintiff in his business or  property, the plaintiff\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n246 (1989); see also Sedima, 473 U.S. at 499 (\"Congress wanted to\r                                     \r\nreach both  'legitimate'  and 'illegitimate'  enterprises.

The fact that   1964(c) is\r\nused against respected businesses  allegedly engaged in a pattern\r\nof   specifically  identified   criminal  conduct  is   hardly  a\r\nsufficient  reason  for  assuming  that the  provision  is  being\r\nmisconstrued.\" (citation  omitted)); Abrams,  supra,   1.1,  at 5\r                                                             \r\n(\"RICO's  name  might suggest  that the  private cause  of action\r\nreaches primarily  racketeers and other organized  crime figures.\r\nDevelopments  since RICO's  1970  enactment, however,  have  laid\r\nfirmly to rest any suggestion of limited reach.\").\r\n\n                               -32-\r\r\n\nhas  a claim under   1964(c).

There is nothing  in the language of RICO which suggests\r\n\nthat Congress  intended to  deny standing  to plaintiffs who  are\r\n\nalleged  to have  committed  bribery or  paid extortion,  whether\r\n\nunder coercion or not.  \r\n\n          Standing    involves   three    analytically   distinct\r\n\nrequirements: injury-in-fact,  a  causal connection  between  the\r\n\ninjury and the conduct  complained of, and whether the  wrong may\r\n\nbe redressed.  Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-\r                                                       \r\n\n61  (1992).   All  three elements  of  the standing  inquiry  are\r\n\nsatisfied  on the  pleadings  here.   Plaintiffs have  adequately\r\n\nalleged  injury-in-fact (financial  loss),  a  causal  connection\r\n\n(defendants' corruptly demanding payments),  and that the  injury\r\n\nwill be redressed by  a favorable decision (availability of  RICO\r\n\ndamages).   See  Sedima,  473  U.S.  at  496  (noting  that  RICO\r                                 \r\n\nplaintiff  has standing  only  if \"he  has  been injured  in  his\r\n\nbusiness or property by the conduct constituting the violation\");\r\n\nLibertad v. Welch, 53 F.3d 428, 436 (1st Cir. 1995).  This is not\r                           \r\n\na  case  where the  plaintiffs attempt  to  assert the  rights of\r\n\nothers.   Cf.  Carter v.  Berger, 777  F.2d 1173 (7th  Cir. 1985)\r                                          \r\n\n(county, not individual taxpayers, may sue under RICO for bribery\r\n\nscheme resulting in underpayment of taxes).  Accordingly, I would\r\n\nend the standing analysis there.\r\n\n          In  considering whether there  is an  \"innocent victim\"\r\n\nstanding  requirement, I  doubt  that Congress  intended for  the\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\nfederal  courts to  refer to  and incorporate  state law.10   The\r\n\ndefendants argue  that the innocent  victim requirement is  to be\r\n\nfound  in the  distinction,  found in  some  state laws,  between\r\n\nbribery and coercive  extortion.  They buttress their argument by\r\n\nreference to provisions  of the Model Penal Code.   The matter of\r\n\nwhether  the activities  in  which these  plaintiffs engaged  fit\r\n\nwithin the category of bribery or of coercive extortion is, in my\r\n\nview, not relevant to the issue of standing.11\r\n\n          Although RICO references state law in its definition of\r\n\n\"racketeering  activity,\"12 it  makes no  substantive distinction\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10  Caselaw holding  that minority shareholders suffer  no injury\r\nto  their property apart from the  injury the corporation suffers\r\nand so  have no standing to sue under RICO provides no comfort to\r\ndefendants.   Such caselaw  does not  support the principle  that\r\nreference should be made  to state law to determine  the contours\r\nof any \"innocent victim\" defense.  It is true that some decisions\r\nrefer to  state law to define property  interests of shareholders\r\nas opposed  to corporations to  determine whether the  former may\r\nbring  a RICO action.   See, e.g.,  Leach v. FDIC,  860 F.2d 1266\r                                                           \r\n(5th  Cir. 1988),  cert.  denied, 491  U.S.  905 (1989).

In any event, the  issue of whether\r               \r\nstate law should be referenced in defining the term \"property\" is\r\nsimply not present in this case.\r\n\n11  If it were, then I  would agree that on the facts pleaded  it\r\nis impossible  to  draw the  conclusion that  this case  involves\r\nexclusively bribery.\r\n\n12   This  reference to  state law  is in  the context  of RICO's\r\ndefinition of  predicate offenses.   From this,  defendants would\r                                           \r\ninfer a Congressional desire -- expressed nowhere in  the statute\r\n-- to reference state law with respect to affirmative defenses as\r                                                                        \r\nwell.\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nbetween \"bribery\"  and \"extortion.\"   RICO  defines \"racketeering\r\n\nactivity\" in 18 U.S.C.   1961(1)(A) to mean, inter alia, \"any act\r                                                                 \r\n\nor  threat involving . . . bribery [or]  extortion . . . which is\r\n\nchargeable  under State  law and  punishable by  imprisonment for\r\n\nmore than  one  year.\"   Thus,  the federal  statute  recognizes,\r\n\nwithout distinction, acts \"involving\" either bribery or extortion\r\n\nas predicate offenses  for purposes  of RICO.   Further, even  in\r\n\ndefining  such a  predicate offense,  state  law plays  a limited\r\n\nrole:\r\n\n            The labels placed  on a state statute  do\r\n            not   determine   whether  that   statute\r\n            proscribes  bribery  for purposes  of the\r\n            RICO  statute.    Congress  intended  for\r\n            \"bribery\" to be defined  generically when\r\n            it  included bribery as  a predicate act.\r\n            H.R.  Rep.

See 115  Cong. Rec.  6995 (1969) (Report  of A.B.A.\r                           \r\n\nAntitrust Section); Abrams, supra,   1.4, at  25-26.  This may be\r                                           \r\n\na  situation where  Congress did  not explicitly  contemplate the\r\n\nquestion and so congressional \"intent\" in the classic formulation\r\n\nsimply does  not  exist.   The  courts  then are  left  with  the\r\n\ndelicate task of providing the answer.\r\n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\n          I  very  much  doubt  that the  federal  definition  of\r\n\n\"innocence\" for  purposes of the equal  involvement defense would\r\n\nordinarily involve  reference to and incorporation  of state law,\r\n\nas the  majority asserts.18   The Supreme Court  did not look  to\r\n\nstate law to define the defense  in either Perma Life or Bateman,\r                                                                          \r\n\nnor should we do so here.  Nor has this court looked to state law\r\n\nto define the defense under  the Clayton Act in the  aftermath of\r\n\nPerma Life.\r                    \r\n\n          To say there  is some form of  affirmative defense like\r\n\nthe  equal involvement  defense does  not describe  precisely the\r\n\ncontent of such  a defense.  Even  the Supreme Court Justices  in\r\n\nPerma Life did not agree on  the content.  See supra footnote 17.\r                                                              \r\n\nIn the absence of  factual findings in which to set the questions\r\n\nof the  honing  of such  a  defense,  there is,  and  should  be,\r\n\nreluctance  to engage now in  such refinement.   The precision of\r\n\nany standard awaits further development.  It is enough now to say\r\n\nthat  the positions  at the  extremities  -- that  any wrongdoing\r\n\ndisables  a plaintiff  or that  wrongdoing is  irrelevant --  are\r\n\nuntenable.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n18  There may be situations, not present here, in which the state\r\nhas  such   an  exceptionally  strong  policy   interest  in  the\r\nenforcement of  its  own  laws  that  Congress  would  choose  to\r\naccommodate  that interest in the  RICO enforcement scheme.  This\r\nmay be  more true under  RICO than other  statutes in as  much as\r\nCongress has  referred  to violations  of state  law in  defining\r\npredicate offenses under  18 U.S.C.    1961(1)(A).  However,  the\r\nrecognition of an interest  in enforcement is not the same as the\r\nrecognition  of an  interest  in a  defense.   The  Rhode  Island\r\nbribery  and   extortion  statutes   do  not  evidence   such  an\r\noverwhelming interest in affording  defendants an in pari delicto\r                                                                           \r\ndefense, even before reaching the issue of whether Congress would\r\nhave wanted to import Rhode Island law into RICO.\r\n\n                               -43-\r\r\n\n          The  equal involvement  defense  recognized  under  the\r\n\nClayton  Act and  the Securities  Act derives  its contours  from\r\n\nfederal  policy as recognized by  federal statutes.   There is no\r\n\nreason not to apply that paradigm to RICO.19\r\n\n          As to the claim under 42 U.S.C.    1983, the plaintiffs\r\n\nhave adequately alleged that the harm they suffered was caused by\r\n\nthe  extortionist  policies  and  practices  in  which  the  town\r\n\nofficials are claimed  to have engaged.  Again, there  is no need\r\n\nto  delve into  the  distinction between  coercive extortion  and\r\n\nbribery.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n19    The district  court  was  very troubled  by  the  notion of\r\nrewarding people  who pay  bribes to public  officials with  RICO\r\ntreble damages, whatever the circumstances of the payment.  Roma,\r                                                                          \r\n906 F. Supp. at 82-83.   That is certainly a  reasonable concern.\r\nPolicy arguments may be  made both for and against such a result.\r\nIn  the antitrust field, the Supreme Court has noted that because\r\nof the \"important public purposes\" served by private suits, it is\r\ninappropriate  to invoke  \"broad common-law barriers  to relief.\"\r\nPerma  Life, 392 U.S. at 138.   Thus \"the plaintiff who reaps the\r                     \r\nreward of  treble damages may  be no  less morally  reprehensible\r\nthan  the defendant, but the  law encourages his  suit to further\r\nthe  overriding public policy in  favor of competition.\"   Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n139.\r\n\n    This strong  enforcement rationale  certainly  is present  in\r\nRICO,  a statute  intended  to increase  the  arsenal of  weapons\r\nstriking at criminal activity.  In addition, it may be inherently\r\nunfair  to deny  plaintiffs any  ability to  pursue a  RICO claim\r\nwhere their  fault is relatively  small.   An absolute  \"innocent\r\nvictim\" requirement would create such an undesirable imbalance.\r\n\n                               -44-\r\r\n",

The plaintiffs  Peter Zanni  and\r\n\nRoma  entered into a  real estate development  venture with Harry\r\n\nand  Russell  DePetrillo (\"the  DePetrillos\").    Unknown to  the\r\n\nplaintiffs, the DePetrillos had  entered into an arrangement with\r\n\nthe alleged de facto government of  the Town, with aRusso as \"the\r\n\nBoss,\" under which payments  would be made to this  enterprise in\r\n\norder to obtain necessary approvals.  After the DePetrillos  sold\r\n\ntheir share, Peter  Zanni was informed of  this preexisting deal,\r\n\nand was  warned that his  project was \"dead\"  if he did  not make\r\n\npayments.  Having invested heavily in the project, and reasonably\r\n\nbelieving that he was dealing with a racketeering enterprise that\r\n\nhad extorted and stolen for years during its control of the Town,\r\n\nPeter Zanni paid up.  He  continued paying for three years, until\r\n\nhe  was  able to  sell his  share of  the  development.   He then\r\n\ninformed the FBI, and cooperated with its investigation and later\r\n\nwith prosecutions of official corruption in the Town.\r\n\n          Peter Zanni  and Roma  brought federal and  state civil\r\n\nracketeering  claims and  federal civil  rights  claims, charging\r\n\nthat they were  injured by the conduct  of aRusso and his  fellow\r\n\nindividual defendants, as well  as the Town.  The  district court\r\n\ndismissed these charges on  the grounds that the plaintiffs'  own\r\n\nconduct rendered them unable to maintain  standing to press their\r\n\nclaims.     The  plaintiffs   appeal  the  dismissals   of  their\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nracketeering1 and civil  rights claims, as  well as the  district\r\n\ncourt's  decision to  deny the  pro hac  vice admission  of their\r                                                       \r\n\ndesired counsel, G.

Causes of Action\r                                 A.

We then shift to\r\n\nthe issue of the plaintiffs' section 1983 claims.\r\n\n                      1.  Standard of Review\r                                1.

Subsection (c) of\r\n\nsection  1962, in  turn, declares  that it  is unlawful  \"for any\r\n\nperson employed  by or associated with any enterprise engaged in,\r\n\nor  the  activities  of   which  affect,  interstate  or  foreign\r\n\ncommerce, to  conduct or participate, directly  or indirectly, in\r\n\nthe conduct  of such  enterprise's affairs  through a  pattern of\r\n\nracketeering  activity or  collection of unlawful  debt.\"   Id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n1962(c).  An \"enterprise\" is  defined to include \"any individual,\r\n\npartnership, corporation, association or other legal entity,  and\r\n\nany union or group of individuals associated in fact although not\r\n\na legal entity.\"  Id.   1961(4). \"Racketeering activity\" includes\r                               \r\n\nany  one of a number of enumerated criminal acts indictable under\r\n\nfederal  or  state law.    See id.     1961(1).   A  \"'pattern of\r                                            \r\n\nracketeering activity' requires at least two acts of racketeering\r\n\nactivity . . . the last of which  occurred within ten years . . .\r\n\nafter the commission  of a prior  act of racketeering  activity.\"\r\n\nId.   1961(5).\r             \r\n\n          The district court dismissed the plaintiffs' civil RICO\r\n\nclaims on  the ground  that, by  their own pleadings,  plaintiffs\r\n\nwere not innocent victims and therefore could  not maintain civil\r\n\nRICO  standing.    The  district  court  found  support  for  the\r\n\nproposition that only innocent  victims could collect damages via\r\n\ncivil  RICO in  the legislative  history of  the provision.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nOrganized Crime Control:  Hearings on S.  30 Before the  Subcomm.\r                                                                           \r\n\nNo. 5 of the  House Committee on the  Judiciary, 91st Cong.,  2d.\r                                                         \r\n\nSess.

The district court's reasoning can  be\r\n\nbetter delineated in conjunction with a recitation of plaintiffs'\r\n\nclaims.   Drawing inferences  in favor of  the plaintiffs,  their\r\n\npleadings suggest the following situation.  The plaintiffs joined\r\n\nthe  DePetrillos  in  a  real estate  venture,  unaware  that the\r\n\nDePetrillos  had  entered  into  a  scheme  in  which  regulatory\r\n\napprovals  had   already  been   granted  in  exchange   for  the\r\n\nDePetrillos'  payment  of $10,000  to  aRusso  and his  purported\r\n\nassociates.    The plaintiffs  were  similarly  unaware that  the\r\n\nDePetrillos  had agreed  to pay an  additional $40,000.   Several\r\n\nyears  later, defendant Councilman Benjamin Zanni approached them\r\n\nfor  the  purported  \"balance  due.\"    As  the   district  court\r\n\nemphasized,  the plaintiffs  then faced  a dilemma.    They could\r\n\nrefuse  to pay, jeopardizing  their $2 million  investment in the\r\n\nproject,  and   as  the   district  court  suggested   was  their\r\n\nobligation, go immediately  to the authorities.   Or, they  could\r\n\nsubmit to this extortion to protect their investment.  They chose\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nthe latter route.   The plaintiffs state that they  complied with\r\n\nall  rules  and  regulations,   and  did  not  seek  preferential\r\n\ntreatment,  but  paid to  avoid threatened  adverse consequences.\r\n\nSpecifically,  the plaintiffs point  to Benjamin  Zanni's alleged\r\n\nstatement  to Plaintiff Peter  Zanni that the  venture was \"dead\"\r\n\nunless the balance was paid.  Three years later,  after they sold\r\n\ntheir  partnership  interests  in  the  venture,  the  plaintiffs\r\n\ncontacted the FBI, and assisted agents in a sting operation.\r\n\n          Looking at these contentions, one reasonable conclusion\r\n\nis  that the plaintiffs made these payments without any intent or\r\n\ndesire to  subvert governmental processes, but  felt compelled to\r\n\npay  to protect their substantial investment  in the venture, and\r\n\ndid  not contact the FBI until they  had mitigated risks to their\r\n\ninvestment.   However,  the district  court concluded  that, even\r\n\nunder this favorable view  of the plaintiffs' conduct they  could\r\n\nnot be considered innocent  parties, and so could  not, according\r\n\nto the district court's interpretation of RICO standing, maintain\r\n\na civil RICO claim.  The district court concluded that, since the\r\n\nplaintiffs' own pleadings indicate that they paid $40,000 to  the\r\n\nindividual defendants to assure  timely processing of permits and\r\n\napprovals  necessary  for  their  project,  the  plaintiffs  were\r\n\n\"neither  innocent nor victims.\"  Roma Constr.

In\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nthe alternative, the plaintiffs  contend that, even assuming such\r\n\nan \"innocent  party\" requirement, the  district court erred  as a\r\n\nmatter  of law in concluding, that even taking the most favorable\r\n\nview  of the  plaintiffs'  pleadings, they  were necessarily  not\r\n\n\"innocent  parties.\"  Although  the district  court spoke  of the\r\n\n\"innocent party\"  requirement as one of \"standing,\" it appears to\r\n\nhave also considered its \"innocent party\" requirement as being in\r\n\nthe nature of an affirmative defense which could be determined at\r\n\nthe pleadings stage.

Whether  or not\r                                   \r\n\nthere exists such an \"innocent  party\" requirement is a  question\r\n\nof first impression in this circuit and, indeed, we are not aware\r\n\nof any  cases anywhere that  adopt such  a requirement.   We need\r\n\nnot,  however, decide whether or  to what extent  RICO imposes an\r\n\n\"innocent party\"  limitation,  or whether  any  such  requirement\r\n\nmight take the form  of a standing requirement or  an affirmative\r\n\ndefense, because  we conclude  that the  district court  erred in\r\n\nfinding that plaintiffs could  prove no set of facts  which would\r\n\nshow   their  nonculpability  under  all  potentially  applicable\r\n\ncriminal statutes.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  In deciding not to address the broader issues discussed in the\r\nconcurring  opinion, we  need  not necessarily  quarrel with  our\r\nrespected  colleague's analysis.

In  deciding  that such  payments,  even if  coerced,\r\n\nforced  it  to conclude  that  the plaintiffs  were  not innocent\r\n\nvictims, the  district  court cited  two authorities.   See  Roma\r                                                                           \r\n\nConstr. Co., 906 F. Supp. at 81-82 (citing R.I. Gen.

Gen. Laws   11-7-4 (1994).  The  statutory language does not\r\n\naddress the question of  whether one who pays due  to coercion is\r\n\nan innocent victim.  The district court did not refer  to, and we\r\n\nfail  to find, any Rhode  Island authority for  direction on this\r\n\npoint.\r\n\n          Rather, the  district court  drew on the  commentary to\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\nundeveloped record  presently before  the court.   The concurring\r\nopinion hypothesizes that the substance of any such defense would\r\nbe informed by preexisting  federal statutes embodying comparable\r\ndefenses.   By contrast,  the district court's  dismissal depends\r\nentirely  on  the  existence,  vel  non,  of either  an  absolute\r                                                 \r\ninnocent-victim \"standing\"  requirement or  a  law-based in  pari\r                                                                           \r\ndelicto  defense,  each of  which, by  its  very nature,  is more\r                 \r\nreadily susceptible  to summary disposition than a fact-intensive\r\n\"equal involvement\" defense.   Thus  we caution  that nothing  we\r\nhave  said is meant to  suggest that Congress  intended to create\r\neither  such  a \"standing\"  requirement  or  an  in pari  delicto\r                                                                           \r\ndefense.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\nthe Model Penal Code's definition of bribery to conclude that the\r\n\nplaintiffs'  payments, even  if construed  to be  the product  of\r\n\ncoercion, constituted illegal bribery.

The  cited commentary to  section 240.1 of  the\r\n\nModel Penal Code states that \r\n\n            [a]  private citizen  who responds  to an\r\n            official's  threat  of adverse  action by\r\n            paying  money  to  secure more  favorable\r\n            treatment evidences thereby a willingness\r\n            to  subvert  the legitimate  processes of\r\n            government   .   .  .   .   Such  conduct\r\n            constitutes  a  degree of  cooperation in\r\n            the undermining of governmental integrity\r\n            that  is  inconsistent with  the complete\r\n            exoneration from criminal liability.\r\n\nModel  Penal Code   240.1 commentary  at 41 (1980).  The district\r\n\ncourt  thus concluded that  since even the  interpretation of the\r\n\npleadings   that   most   favors   the  plaintiffs   requires   a\r\n\ndetermination that plaintiffs capitulated to official  threats of\r\n\nadverse action, they were not \"innocent parties.\"  Taken together\r\n\nwith  its  reading  of  the  legislative  history  that RICO  was\r\n\nintended to protect \"innocent parties\" and with its assessment of\r\n\npublic policy in the form of \"economic  incentives,\" the district\r\n\ncourt  proceeded  to  dismiss   the  plaintiffs'  claims  on  the\r\n\npleadings.

The district  court suggested that  the\r\n\nCongress that enacted RICO in  1970, which referred obliquely  in\r\n\nlegislative history to the  purpose of aiding \"innocent parties,\"\r\n\nwould be cognizant of the emerging Model Penal  Code trend in the\r\n\nlaw  of bribery, presupposing that Congress gave courts the power\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nto develop substantive law regarding this issue.\r\n\n          We find  no evidence  of any congressional  intent that\r\n\nthe \"innocence\"  of a RICO \"victim\"  should be made to  turn on a\r\n\nuniform federal common  law rule.

The district\r\n\ncourt relied on the Model  Penal Code's bribery provision,  which\r\n\nstates that \r\n\n          [a] person is guilty  of bribery, a felony of\r\n          the  third degree, if  he offers, confers, or\r\n          agrees  to confer upon  another, or solicits,\r\n          accepts or agrees to accept from another:\r\n\n             (1)    any    pecuniary    benefit    as\r\n            consideration    for    the   recipient's\r\n            decision,  opinion, recommendation,  vote\r\n            or  other  exercise  of  discretion  as a\r\n            public servant, party official, or voter;\r\n            or\r\n\n             (2) any benefit as consideration for the\r\n            recipient's        decision,        vote,\r\n            recommendation   or  other   exercise  of\r\n            official  discretion  in  a  judicial  or\r\n            administrative proceeding; or\r\n\n             (3) any benefit  as consideration for  a\r\n            violation  of  a known  legal  duty as  a\r\n            public servant or party official.   \r\n\nModel  Penal Code    240.1  (\"Bribery in  Official and  Political\r\n\nMatters\").   While the district court may  have rightly concluded\r\n\nthat the plaintiffs are  not innocent of bribery under  the Model\r\n\nPenal Code, we do not think  that this fact counsels for the same\r\n\nconclusion  under   Rhode  Island  law,  since   the  Code's  own\r\n\ncommentaries expressly  recognize that  the Code does  not follow\r\n\nRhode  Island law.  Part II Model  Penal Code and Commentaries 6,\r\n\nn.2 (1980).  Moreover,  unlike Rhode Island's statute,  the Model\r\n\nPenal Code  provision contains  no requirement that  a payor  act\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\n\"corruptly.\"  Compare R.I.

At this  stage  of the  game,  since one\r\n\nplausible view is  that the  plaintiffs were in  fact victims  of\r\n\ncoercive  extortion, and  since they  have not  pled guilty  to a\r\n\ncrime that involves \"corrupt intent\" as an element as we noted of\r\n\nthe defendants in Mariano, 983 F.2d at 1159, we conclude that the\r                                   \r\n\nplaintiffs in the instant case may press on with their claim.  As\r\n\na  result, we  reverse  the  district  court's dismissal  of  the\r\n\nplaintiffs' federal  RICO claims.

This ruling, one of  law, was, I believe,\r\n\nin error.  The  question is, concededly, one of  first impression\r\n\nhere.  Because  I analyze  the matter differently  than does  the\r\n\nmajority, I write separately.\r\n\n          The question of who has standing to bring actions under\r\n\nRICO is a matter of federal law.  The pertinent provision of RICO\r\n\nprovides:\r\n\n            Any  person injured  in  his business  or\r\n            property  by  reason  of  a  violation of\r\n            section  1962 of  this  chapter  may  sue\r\n            therefor in any appropriate United States\r\n            district   court    and   shall   recover\r\n            threefold the damages he sustains and the\r\n            cost of the  suit, including a reasonable\r\n            attorney's fee.  \r\n\n18 U.S.C.    1964(c).   There is no  qualification on  the phrase\r\n\n\"any  person injured  in his business  or property\"  limiting the\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n7   At oral argument, plaintiffs stipulated that their RICO claim\r\nis not asserted against the town, but only against the individual\r\ndefendants.\r\n\n                               -29-\r\r\n\nphrase  to \"innocent\" persons.   RICO defines a  \"person\" as \"any\r\n\nindividual or  entity capable  of holding  a legal  or beneficial\r\n\ninterest in property.\"  18 U.S.C.    1961(3).  On the language of\r\n\nthe statute, plaintiffs meet this definition.8\r\n\n          In general,  the intent  of Congress manifested  in the\r\n\ntext of the statute governs the issue of standing:\r\n\n            In determining the scope of a statute, we\r\n            look  first  to  its  language.   If  the\r\n            statutory language is unambiguous, in the\r\n            absence    of   \"a    clearly   expressed\r\n            legislative intent to the  contrary, that\r\n            language must ordinarily  be regarded  as\r\n            conclusive.\"\r\n\nUnited  States v.

Accordingly, I would\r\n\nend the standing analysis there.\r\n\n          In  considering whether there  is an  \"innocent victim\"\r\n\nstanding  requirement, I  doubt  that Congress  intended for  the\r\n\n                               -33-\r\r\n\nfederal  courts to  refer to  and incorporate  state law.10   The\r\n\ndefendants argue  that the innocent  victim requirement is  to be\r\n\nfound  in the  distinction,  found in  some  state laws,  between\r\n\nbribery and coercive  extortion.  They buttress their argument by\r\n\nreference to provisions  of the Model Penal Code.   The matter of\r\n\nwhether  the activities  in  which these  plaintiffs engaged  fit\r\n\nwithin the category of bribery or of coercive extortion is, in my\r\n\nview, not relevant to the issue of standing.11\r\n\n          Although RICO references state law in its definition of\r\n\n\"racketeering  activity,\"12 it  makes no  substantive distinction\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n10  Caselaw holding  that minority shareholders suffer  no injury\r\nto  their property apart from the  injury the corporation suffers\r\nand so  have no standing to sue under RICO provides no comfort to\r\ndefendants.   Such caselaw  does not  support the principle  that\r\nreference should be made  to state law to determine  the contours\r\nof any \"innocent victim\" defense.  It is true that some decisions\r\nrefer to  state law to define property  interests of shareholders\r\nas opposed  to corporations to  determine whether the  former may\r\nbring  a RICO action.

In any event, the  issue of whether\r               \r\nstate law should be referenced in defining the term \"property\" is\r\nsimply not present in this case.\r\n\n11  If it were, then I  would agree that on the facts pleaded  it\r\nis impossible  to  draw the  conclusion that  this case  involves\r\nexclusively bribery.\r\n\n12   This  reference to  state law  is in  the context  of RICO's\r\ndefinition of  predicate offenses.   From this,  defendants would\r                                           \r\ninfer a Congressional desire -- expressed nowhere in  the statute\r\n-- to reference state law with respect to affirmative defenses as\r                                                                        \r\nwell.\r\n\n                               -34-\r\r\n\nbetween \"bribery\"  and \"extortion.\"   RICO  defines \"racketeering\r\n\nactivity\" in 18 U.S.C.   1961(1)(A) to mean, inter alia, \"any act\r                                                                 \r\n\nor  threat involving . . . bribery [or]  extortion . . . which is\r\n\nchargeable  under State  law and  punishable by  imprisonment for\r\n\nmore than  one  year.\"   Thus,  the federal  statute  recognizes,\r\n\nwithout distinction, acts \"involving\" either bribery or extortion\r\n\nas predicate offenses  for purposes  of RICO.   Further, even  in\r\n\ndefining  such a  predicate offense,  state  law plays  a limited\r\n\nrole:\r\n\n            The labels placed  on a state statute  do\r\n            not   determine   whether  that   statute\r\n            proscribes  bribery  for purposes  of the\r\n            RICO  statute.    Congress  intended  for\r\n            \"bribery\" to be defined  generically when\r\n            it  included bribery as  a predicate act.\r\n            H.R.  Rep.

See 115  Cong. Rec.  6995 (1969) (Report  of A.B.A.\r                           \r\n\nAntitrust Section); Abrams, supra,   1.4, at  25-26.  This may be\r                                           \r\n\na  situation where  Congress did  not explicitly  contemplate the\r\n\nquestion and so congressional \"intent\" in the classic formulation\r\n\nsimply does  not  exist.   The  courts  then are  left  with  the\r\n\ndelicate task of providing the answer.\r\n\n                               -42-\r\r\n\n          I  very  much  doubt  that the  federal  definition  of\r\n\n\"innocence\" for  purposes of the equal  involvement defense would\r\n\nordinarily involve  reference to and incorporation  of state law,\r\n\nas the  majority asserts.18   The Supreme Court  did not look  to\r\n\nstate law to define the defense  in either Perma Life or Bateman,\r                                                                          \r\n\nnor should we do so here.  Nor has this court looked to state law\r\n\nto define the defense under  the Clayton Act in the  aftermath of\r\n\nPerma Life.\r                    \r\n\n          To say there  is some form of  affirmative defense like\r\n\nthe  equal involvement  defense does  not describe  precisely the\r\n\ncontent of such  a defense.  Even  the Supreme Court Justices  in\r\n\nPerma Life did not agree on  the content.  See supra footnote 17.\r                                                              \r\n\nIn the absence of  factual findings in which to set the questions\r\n\nof the  honing  of such  a  defense,  there is,  and  should  be,\r\n\nreluctance  to engage now in  such refinement.   The precision of\r\n\nany standard awaits further development.  It is enough now to say\r\n\nthat  the positions  at the  extremities  -- that  any wrongdoing\r\n\ndisables  a plaintiff  or that  wrongdoing is  irrelevant --  are\r\n\nuntenable.\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n18  There may be situations, not present here, in which the state\r\nhas  such   an  exceptionally  strong  policy   interest  in  the\r\nenforcement of  its  own  laws  that  Congress  would  choose  to\r\naccommodate  that interest in the  RICO enforcement scheme.  This\r\nmay be  more true under  RICO than other  statutes in as  much as\r\nCongress has  referred  to violations  of state  law in  defining\r\npredicate offenses under  18 U.S.C.    1961(1)(A).  However,  the\r\nrecognition of an interest  in enforcement is not the same as the\r\nrecognition  of an  interest  in a  defense.   The  Rhode  Island\r\nbribery  and   extortion  statutes   do  not  evidence   such  an\r\noverwhelming interest in affording  defendants an in pari delicto\r                                                                           \r\ndefense, even before reaching the issue of whether Congress would\r\nhave wanted to import Rhode Island law into RICO.\r\n\n                               -43-\r\r\n\n          The  equal involvement  defense  recognized  under  the\r\n\nClayton  Act and  the Securities  Act derives  its contours  from\r\n\nfederal  policy as recognized by  federal statutes.   There is no\r\n\nreason not to apply that paradigm to RICO.19\r\n\n          As to the claim under 42 U.S.C.    1983, the plaintiffs\r\n\nhave adequately alleged that the harm they suffered was caused by\r\n\nthe  extortionist  policies  and  practices  in  which  the  town\r\n\nofficials are claimed  to have engaged.  Again, there  is no need\r\n\nto  delve into  the  distinction between  coercive extortion  and\r\n\nbribery.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n19    The district  court  was  very troubled  by  the  notion of\r\nrewarding people  who pay  bribes to public  officials with  RICO\r\ntreble damages, whatever the circumstances of the payment.  Roma,\r                                                                          \r\n906 F. Supp. at 82-83.   That is certainly a  reasonable concern.\r\nPolicy arguments may be  made both for and against such a result.\r\nIn  the antitrust field, the Supreme Court has noted that because\r\nof the \"important public purposes\" served by private suits, it is\r\ninappropriate  to invoke  \"broad common-law barriers  to relief.\"\r\nPerma  Life, 392 U.S. at 138.   Thus \"the plaintiff who reaps the\r                     \r\nreward of  treble damages may  be no  less morally  reprehensible\r\nthan  the defendant, but the  law encourages his  suit to further\r\nthe  overriding public policy in  favor of competition.\"   Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n139.\r\n\n    This strong  enforcement rationale  certainly  is present  in\r\nRICO,  a statute  intended  to increase  the  arsenal of  weapons\r\nstriking at criminal activity.  In addition, it may be inherently\r\nunfair  to deny  plaintiffs any  ability to  pursue a  RICO claim\r\nwhere their  fault is relatively  small.   An absolute  \"innocent\r\nvictim\" requirement would create such an undesirable imbalance.\r\n\n                               -44-\r\r\n</pre>",
