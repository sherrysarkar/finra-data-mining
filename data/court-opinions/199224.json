Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Bernardo Figueroa on brief pro se.\n     Michael B. Grant on Motion for Summary Disposition for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n\n                          January 8, 2001\n\f          Per Curiam. Pro se appellant, Bernardo Figueroa,\n\nappeals from the district court's dismissal of his 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 action against state prison officials.             We vacate the\n\norder of dismissal and remand to the district court for the\n\nfollowing reasons.\n\n          The   district    court       dismissed   the   action   with\n\nprejudice for lack of prosecution after Figueroa, who is\n\nincarcerated    in    Virginia,    failed     to    appear   for   jury\n\nempanelment in Rhode Island.            See Fed. R. Civ. P. 41(b).\n\nPrior to dismissal, in one or more telephone conferences,\n\nthe court had ordered Figueroa to pay for his transportation\n\nto Rhode Island, eventually warning him that his action\n\nwould be dismissed for lack of prosecution if he did not\n\nappear.   When he failed to appear, the court dismissed the\n\naction with prejudice.      The record shows that, apart from\n\nhis failure to appear for jury empanelment, Figueroa had\n\ndiligently pursued his litigation.          Moreover, he is indigent\n\n(the district court granted his request to proceed in forma\n\npauperis in this action and on appeal), and, on appeal,\n\nstates that he was unable to pay for his transportation to\n\nRhode Island.        He asserts that dismissal of his action\n\ninfringed his right to court access.\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f              We review dismissals under Rule 41(b) for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, engaging in an \"open-ended balancing test,\"\n\nwhich considers all relevant factors.                  See Benjamin v.\n\nAroostook Med. Ctr., Inc., 57 F.3d 101, 107 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nThe courts of appeals have \"uniformly concluded that a\n\ndismissal for failure to prosecute in cases [in which an\n\nincarcerated pro se inmate has failed to appear at trial or\n\nfor hearings] constitutes error if the trial court has not\n\nconsidered a broad range of less severe alternatives prior\n\nto entering dismissal.\"        Hernandez v. Whiting, 881 F.2d 768,\n\n769    (9th    Cir.    1989)   (canvassing     the    cases);    Poole   v.\n\nLambert, 819 F.2d 1025, 1029 (11th Cir. 1987) (per curiam)\n\n(describing alternatives and requiring district courts to be\n\n\"imaginative and innovative\" in handling inmate civil rights\n\nlitigation in order not to deprive inmates of their \"day in\n\ncourt\") (citing Ballard v. Spradley, 557 F.2d 476, 480 (5th\n\nCir. 1977)).      We realize that this puts an additional burden\n\non    the   district    courts,   and    we   doubt   that   a   plausible\n\nalternative existed here.           In an abundance of caution,\n\nhowever, we believe that the district court, at the very\n\nleast, should make explicit that it considered and rejected\n\nother alternatives, and explain why it concluded that a\n\ntrial with Figueroa present was necessary.\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f         Accordingly, we think it advisable to vacate the\n\njudgment below and remand the case to the district court to\n\nconsider possible alternatives to an in-person trial and, if\n\nit persists in believing that none is feasible, to reinstate\n\nits order of dismissal, this time addressing in a written\n\nmemorandum why no other alternatives will do.\n\n         Vacated and remanded to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                            -4-\n\f",
