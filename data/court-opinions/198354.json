Jose Antonio Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                          Before\r\n\n                  Selya, Circuit Judge,\r\n             Bownes, Senior Circuit Judge,\r\n               and Stahl, Circuit Judge.\r\n\n Marlene Aponte Cabrera on brief for appellant.\r\n Guillermo Gil, United States Attorney, Nelson Perez-Sosa,\r\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Michelle Morales, Assistant\r\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMarch 4, 1999\r\n\n        Per Curiam.  Defendant-appellant Arnaldo Wilson-Lopez\r\nappeals from the district court's denial of his motion to\r\nwithdraw his guilty plea, filed before sentencing, and from the\r\ndistrict court's failure to rule upon his motion for a new\r\ntrial pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 33.  He also raises an\r\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.  We summarily affirmappellant's conviction and sentence, without prejudice to\r\nWilson-Lopez raising his ineffective assistance arguments\r\nbefore the district court on collateral review.  Accordingly,\r\nwe sever this appeal (No. 98-1211) from the other pending\r\nappeal (No. 98-1212) with which it previously was consolidated.\r\n          I. Motion to Withdraw Guilty Plea\r\n          \"Even prior to the imposition of sentence, a\r\ndefendant does not have an unqualified right to withdraw a\r\nguilty plea. Rather, a presentence motion to retract a plea can\r\nbe granted 'only upon an affirmative showing of a \"fair and\r\njust reason.\"' The burden of proof rests with the defendant. \r\nIn deference to the intimate tri-cornered relationship among\r\ntrial judge, prosecutor and criminal defendant, we review a\r\ndistrict court's denial of a request to withdraw a guilty plea\r\nsolely for abuse of discretion.\" United States v. Gonzalez-\r\nVazquez, 34 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 1994) (citations omitted).\r\n          We apply the \"well-established framework for\r\nevaluating plea withdrawal motions,\" United States v. Sanchez-\r\nBarreto, 93 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied,    U.S.\r\n  , 117 S.Ct. 711 (1997), and conclude that there was no abuse\r\n                              -2-\r\nof discretion by the district court.  \"We have found no abuse\r\nof discretion in disallowing plea withdrawal motions where Rule\r\n11 safeguards were scrupulously followed by the district\r\ncourt.\"  Id.  That was the case here.  Specifically, the\r\ntranscript of the change of plea hearing belies Wilson-Lopez'\r\nclaim that he pled guilty on the mistaken belief that he could\r\nreceive a thirty-year sentence for carrying a machine gun if he\r\ndid not accept the government's plea offer.  There is no\r\nfactual support in the record for that claim that the plea was\r\ninvoluntary and unknowing.  The four-month delay in filing the\r\nmotion to withdraw the plea and the implausibility of the\r\nproffered reason for the motion also support the district\r\ncourt's denial.  Finally, the district court was well-within\r\nits discretion in rejecting Wilson-Lopez' claim of innocence\r\nwith respect to the drug trafficking count. See id. at 24.  The\r\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that\r\nWilson-Lopez failed to present a \"fair and just reason\" for the\r\nwithdrawal of his plea.\r\n          II. Rule 33 Motion for a New Trial\r\n          The district court did not err in failing to grant\r\nthis motion as Rule 33 does not apply where there has been no\r\ntrial:\r\n          By its express terms, Rule 33 is confined\r\n          to those situations in which a trial has\r\n          been had.  In the court below, appellant\r\n          admitted his guilt, abjuring a trial.  A\r\n          defendant who enters a guilty plea cannot\r\n          thereafter uses Rule 33 as a wedge to undo\r\n          his acknowledgment that he committed the\r\n          offense.\r\n\nUnited States v. Graciani, 61 F.3d 70, 78 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\n          III. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\r\n          Wilson-Lopez bases his ineffective assistance claim\r\non his counsel's asserted failure accurately to inform him of\r\nthe possible sentence he could receive if he failed to plead\r\nguilty and his claim that his attorney failed to investigate\r\nexculpatory evidence.  \"The absence of a sufficiently developed\r\nfactual record ... precludes reliable review [of most\r\nineffective assistance of counsel claims] on direct appeal.\"\r\nUnited States v. Lopez-Pineda, 55 F.3d 693, 697 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).  So it is here.  Therefore, the claim is rejected,\r\nwithout prejudice to Wilson-Lopez raising these ineffective\r\nassistance arguments on collateral review under 28 U.S.C. \r\n2255.\r\n          The judgment of conviction and sentence is affirmed.\r\nSee Loc. R. 27.1.\r\n",
