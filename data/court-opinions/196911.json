This is  an  appeal from  a district\r                                 \r\n\ncourt order  denying a  motion by  petitioner Alvarez  to set\r\n\naside his conviction and sentence.  See 28 U.S.C.   2255.  We\r                                                   \r\n\naffirm the judgment for the following reasons. \r\n\n          (1)  Petitioner alleges a deprivation of his rights\r\n\nto confrontation, compulsory process,  due process and  equal\r\n\nprotection of the laws, in  a trial court ruling that limited\r\n\nthe  scope  of  co-defendant Flores's  testimony.    The same\r\n\narguments   were   raised,   considered,   and  rejected   on\r\n\npetitioner's  direct appeal.   United States v.  Alvarez, 987\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d 77, 81-83 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 849 (1993).\r                                                   \r\n\nThey may not be resurrected on collateral review.  See Murchu\r                                                                         \r\n\nv. United States,  926 F.2d 50, 55 (1st  Cir.), cert. denied,\r                                                                        \r\n\n502 U.S. 828 (1991).\r\n\n          (2)  Petitioner alleges  ineffective assistance  of\r\n\ncounsel  at trial,  and related  deprivations  of his  rights\r\n\nunder  the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  in  connection  with  the\r\n\nerroneous  admission  into evidence  of  co-defendant Matos's\r\n\npre-trial  statement.   However, to  sustain  such a  claim a\r\n\npetitioner  must show  prejudice, meaning  that  but for  his\r\n\ncounsel's  alleged error the  result of the  proceeding would\r\n\nhave been  different.   See Argencourt  v. United  States, 78\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 14,  15 (1st Cir.  1996).  On direct  appeal, petitioner\r\n\nmade the  same argument as  to prejudice that he  makes here,\r\n\ni.e., that \"spillover prejudice\" from the erroneous admission\r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\nof Matos's statement entitled him to a reversal or new trial.\r\n\nA  panel of  this  court concluded  that  although Matos  was\r\n\nentitled to  a reversal  due to the  error, as  to petitioner\r\n\nthere  was sufficient evidence to sustain the jury's verdict.\r\n\nAlvarez,  987  F.2d at  83-84.    Thus  this claim,  too,  is\r                   \r\n\nforeclosed by the decision on  direct review, and we need not\r\n\nreach   petitioner's   allegation    that   trial   counsel's\r\n\nperformance in this regard was deficient.\r\n\n          (3) Petitioner claims that the district court erred\r\n\nat sentencing in  attributing to him the total  weight of the\r\n\ncocaine found  in all  three codefendants'  suitcases.   This\r\n\nalleged  nonconstitutional, nonjurisdictional  error was  not\r\n\nraised on direct appeal.   It may not  be considered for  the\r\n\nfirst  time under     2255 absent  a showing  of \"exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances\"  amounting  to   a  complete  miscarriage   of\r\n\njustice.  Knight  v. United States, 37 F.3d  769, 772-73 (1st\r                                              \r\n\nCir. 1994).  No exceptional circumstances were shown here.1\r                                                                      1\r\n\n          Although no other issues are raised in petitioner's\r\n\nbriefs, appellee spontaneously  argues that defense counsel's\r\n\nfailure  to call  petitioner as  a witness  at the  trial was\r\n\nprobably  a deliberate  strategic decision.   Petitioner  now\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n   1   While this case  was pending on appeal,  the President\r               1\r\nsigned into law the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\r\nAct of 1996, Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (Apr. 24, 1996).\r\nAlthough neither party has raised  the issue, we note that we\r\nneed not  decide in this  case whether any of the  amendments\r\nin the Act apply, since it would not alter our disposition.\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\ncontends that  he needs  the assistance of  counsel to  brief\r\n\nthis  new question.   As  the  issue itself  is not  properly\r\n\nbefore us (it was not squarely presented to the court below),\r\n\nand  in  any event  we  see  no  reason to  appoint  counsel,\r\n\npetitioner's supplementary memorandum seeking reconsideration\r\n\nof our order denying an appointment of counsel is denied.    \r                                                                    \r\n\n          The judgment below is affirmed.\r                                                    \r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n",
