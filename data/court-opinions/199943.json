This is an appeal by\n\nplaintiff-appellant Marie Berthe Francois from a grant of summary\n\njudgment to defendant-appellee Putnam Investments, LLC.                       Plaintiff\n\nis an African-American woman whose country of origin is Haiti. She\n\nclaims   that    defendant      failed         to   promote    her   to   a   full-time\n\nposition, as promised, because of her race and national origin.\n\nThe   district    court,       in    a    well-reasoned        opinion,    found   that\n\nplaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                         I.    FACTS\n\n            Defendant's business is providing financial investment\n\nservices.     Plaintiff first worked for defendant as a part-time\n\ntemporary     employee     in       Putnam's        Image    Operations    Department,\n\nperforming photocopying and related tasks.                      She started work in\n\nNovember, 1994, but left her job less than a year later without\n\ngiving notice.      This would normally render her ineligible to be\n\nrehired under Putnam's employment rules.\n\n             Plaintiff applied for work again with Putnam in September\n\n1996.    Her previous employment record apparently was not noted by\n\ndefendant    because     she    was      hired      as   a   temporary    processor   in\n\nPutnam's Adjustments Department.                    As a processor, plaintiff was\n\ninvolved in data processing and making adjustments in records of\n\nvarious financial transactions.                  This work was considered to be\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fdifficult and demanding.        Newly-hired processors received dual\n\ntraining: direct instructions and on-the-job training.             It soon\n\nbecame evident to plaintiff's supervisors that plaintiff was unable\n\nto grasp the fundamentals of the adjustments process.            Defendant\n\nused a weekly tracking system to determine the productivity and\n\naccuracy of its processors.      Plaintiff's track record showed that\n\nshe did not approach Putnam's target standards and consistently\n\nperformed below the level of her peers.\n\n             Defendant decided that plaintiff should be given the\n\nopportunity to retrain in the adjustments department in November,\n\n1996.   Three supervisors met with plaintiff and told her that if\n\nher performance improved after the retraining, she would be given\n\nthe   next   available    permanent    appointment   in   the   adjustments\n\ndepartment.    Plaintiff's retraining was not successful.         According\n\nto defendant, plaintiff also added to her work difficulties by\n\nreporting late for work on three occasions between early November\n\nand December, 1996.      She was given an early warning that lasted for\n\nthree months, until March 3, 1997.          Defendant had a policy that\n\nprohibited a temporary employee from becoming a permanent employee\n\nwhile under a disciplinary warning.\n\n             In mid-December, 1996, plaintiff filed a charge with the\n\nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) alleging\n\nthat one of her supervisors, Ronald Cupples, delayed her permanent\n\nappointment, citing her lack of productivity.         Plaintiff alleges,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fhowever,    that   this   was   only    a    pretext       to   cover   up    racial\n\ndiscrimination.    Another of her supervisors, Robbin Beauchamp, met\n\nwith plaintiff to investigate her claim of racial discrimination\n\nand discuss the MCAD charge. As quoted at length, infra, plaintiff\n\noffered two differing accounts of this conversation, from which she\n\nclaims racial discrimination against her can be found.\n\n            On January 9, 1997, Beauchamp again met with plaintiff to\n\nexplore the possibility of her being transferred to the Image\n\nOperations     Department.      According          to    Beauchamp’s    affidavit,\n\nplaintiff    did   interview    for    a     job    in    the   Image   Operations\n\nDepartment.     She was rejected for the position after she told the\n\nhiring manager that she had previously worked in the department and\n\ndid not like the management, rules, work, or atmosphere.\n\n             In late January, 1997, plaintiff was assigned to work on\n\nher   department’s    \"special    projects.\"              These   projects      were\n\nadjustments to customer accounts that were very extensive and took\n\nmuch longer than the regular process adjustments. She was assigned\n\nto work with Trisha Labonte, who reviewed and exercised quality\n\ncontrol over all of plaintiff's work.               Labonte met with plaintiff\n\nand pointed out to her that she was not doing the work properly and\n\ndid not have a good understanding of what was required.                      Labonte\n\ngave plaintiff a copy of a memo that she (Labonte) was giving to\n\nthe department supervisor.       It contained a list of five mistakes\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthat plaintiff had made on a project on which she had worked.\n\nAccording to Labonte, plaintiff signed the memo without comment.\n\n            On February 6, 1997, plaintiff expressed an interest in\n\ntwo vacant processing jobs in other departments, but was told that\n\nshe   was    ineligible     for     another      processing      position.       On\n\nFebruary 12, 1997, plaintiff resigned from Putnam. She left a note\n\non Cupples's desk, which read:\n\n            I will not be here on Friday, 2/14/97. I will\n            not have a chance to see you and say good bye.\n            If I don't, I want you to know it was a\n            pleasure to have you as my supervisor. I had\n            learn [sic] a lot from here.      I will miss\n            everybody.\n\n                                          Sincerely,\n\n\n                                          Marie Berthe Francois\n\n            Beauchamp      stated   in    an    affidavit   that    at    the   time\n\nplaintiff resigned, she told him that her husband was returning to\n\nHaiti for work and she needed to stay at home and care for their\n\nchildren.\n\n                           II.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n            Our review is de novo.         Mulero-Rodriguez v. Ponte, Inc.,\n\n98 F.3d 670, 672 (1st Cir. 1996).               We must consider the evidence\n\n\"in the     light   most   favorable      to,    and   drawing   all     reasonable\n\ninferences in favor of, the nonmoving party.\" Feliciano de la Cruz\n\nv. El Conquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f          Where   the   party    opposing   summary   judgment   has   not\n\npresented specific competent proof of a genuine issue of material\n\nfact, we must affirm the judgment below.       Rogan v. City of Boston,\n\n267 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2001); Crawford v. Lamantia, 34 F.3d 28,\n\n31 (1st Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1032 (1995).\n\n                          III.    DISCUSSION\n\n          Plaintiff asserts two claims of racial discrimination:\n\none under federal law for violation of Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964, and one under the laws of Massachusetts, Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch. 151B.   After ruling that plaintiff had not proven a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination under federal law, the district\n\ncourt dismissed the state law claim on the same grounds.\n\n          Plaintiff argues that the district erred by: failing to\n\nclosely examine the overall record and total circumstances of the\n\ncase; ignoring plaintiff's verified complaint (and sworn statement\n\nfiled with the MCAD); and improperly weighing the validity of\n\ninitial material offered as evidence.\n\n          We begin our analysis by examining the verified complaint\n\nand the sworn statement filed with the MCAD.      Under the law of this\n\ncircuit a verified complaint is treated as the\n\n          functional equivalent of an affidavit to the\n          extent that it satisfies the standards\n          explicated in Rule 56(e) (in summary judgment\n          milieu, affidavits \"shall be made on personal\n          knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would\n          be admissible in evidence, and shall show\n          affirmatively that the affiant is competent to\n          testify to the matters stated therein\").\n\n                                   -6-\n\fSkeinkopf v. Stone, 927 F.2d 1259, 1262 (1st Cir. 1991); see also\n\nSimas, 170 F.3d at 46.\n\n           In    reviewing    the    sworn   allegations       in   plaintiff's\n\ncomplaint we keep in mind the restrictions that apply:\n\n           At summary judgment, the district court cannot\n           accept on faith conclusory assessments by\n           claimants that unspecified and unattributed\n           epithets were \"derogatory\" and \"denigrating,\"\n           let alone demonstrated discriminatory intent.\n           See Pilgrim, 118 F.3d at 871 (noting that\n           plaintiff's \"[subjective] perception is not\n           evidence\" of discriminatory intent, hence \"not\n           enough to withstand summary judgment\"); . . .\n           see also Douglass v. United Servs. Auto.\n           Ass'n, 79 F.3d 1415, 1430 (5th Cir. 1996) (en\n           banc) (\"It is . . . well settled that an\n           employee's subjective belief that he suffered\n           an adverse employment action as a result of\n           discrimination, without more, is not enough to\n           survive a summary judgment motion, in the face\n           of proof showing an adequate nondiscriminatory\n           reason.\").\n\nSantiago v. Canon USA, Inc., 138 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           Paragraph 7 of the verified complaint states: \"Francois\n\nwas promised and assured that she would become permanent full-time\n\nbecause defendant was satisfied with her productivity.\"               The basic\n\nquestion in this case is whether plaintiff adduced sufficient\n\nevidence that she left her employment at Putnam because racial\n\ndiscrimination barred her from becoming a permanent employee rather\n\nthan her being denied permanent status because she was unable to do\n\nthe   required   work.       There   is   nothing   in   the    record   beyond\n\nplaintiff's self-serving statements that defendant \"was satisfied\n\nwith her productivity.\"         Indeed, the affidavits and statements\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffiled by defendant are directly contrary.           Moreover, the record\n\nshows that in the process of training for a temporary position, she\n\nquit without formal notice to defendant.         And the note she left for\n\nCupples did not contain any claims of racial discrimination;\n\nrather, it stated: \"I want you to know it was a pleasure to have\n\nyou   as   my   supervisor.\"    According   to    Beauchamp’s    affidavit,\n\nplaintiff told him that her reason for leaving was that her husband\n\nhad returned to Haiti and plaintiff had to look after their\n\nchildren.       On the record, we find it hard not to accept the\n\ndistrict    court’s    conclusion   that    an    essential     element   of\n\nplaintiff’s prima facie case is lacking - namely the existence of\n\ncredible evidence that plaintiff was qualified to perform the\n\npermanent data processing position she sought.\n\n            Moreover, even assuming plaintiff had established a prima\n\nfacie case, defendant presented overwhelming evidence that it had\n\na legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for not promoting plaintiff\n\nto a permanent position.       Evidence of pretext was simply absent.\n\nThe pleadings and pretrial material show that the only evidence of\n\nracial discrimination came from plaintiff’s conclusory allegations.\n\nThe racially discriminatory statements that plaintiff alleges were\n\nmade by Cupples and Joseph Larabee (Senior Operations Manager at\n\nPutnam who approved plaintiff’s hiring in 1996) were denied by\n\nboth.      We realize that the denials do not erase the alleged\n\nstatements and that if they were of sufficient significance to\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fwarrant a finding, the question of whether or not they were made as\n\nasserted would be a disputed issue of material fact for the\n\nfactfinder to determine.      The question for us is not credibility,\n\nbut materiality.\n\n           At   her    pretrial   deposition,   plaintiff   testified   as\n\nfollows:\n\n           Q. Can you tell me who at Putnam you think\n           was responsible for discriminating against you\n           because of your race?\n\n           A.     I don't know.     After I filed the\n           complaint, my supervisor approached me and\n           told me, \"I've got nothing to do with you,\n           Marie.   If it was for me, you'd be here\n           forever.   But I have orders from the upper\n           management to get rid of you because you were\n           hired by mistake.\"\n\n           Q.         Who told you that?\n\n           A.         Ron Kupples [sic].\n\n           Q.   He told you he was ordered to get rid of\n           you?\n\n           A. He got order [sic] from upper management\n           to get rid of me, because, \"I cannot fire you,\n           you didn't do nothing.\" He called me on the\n           December after they find [sic] out about the\n           MCAD complaint.\n\n               And then he called me not at his office,\n           not at his cube, in the conference room where\n           we always have the staff meeting. It's like a\n           private room like this one here.\n\n              He says, the first thing he asked me, \"Why\n           are you doing this, Marie? I'm not a racist.\"\n           I said, \"Then who is the racist?\" He says, \"I\n           just want you to know I get [sic] order to get\n           rid of you.    You haven't done anything.    I\n           cannot just fire you like that. But I got,\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          they give me an order to get rid           of   you\n          because you were hired by mistake.\"\n\n             I asked him, \"What do you mean by that, I\n          was hired by mistake?\"   He says to me, \"Be\n          smart, but I'm not a racist.\" I asked him,\n          \"Why did they want to get rid of me? I did\n          not do anything.\" He said, \"Be smart, Marie.\n          Come on. It's just to let you know I'm not a\n          racist.\"\n\n          Several   pages   later,   plaintiff   described   a   slightly\n\ndifferent verison of what she viewed as racial discrimination:\n\n             I thought it was going to be at his cube.\n          He said, \"No, let's go to the conference room,\n          that would be more private and confidential.\"\n          He said, \"Why are you doing this?\" I said,\n          \"What, what am I doing?\" He said, \"We find\n          out there's a complaint with the MCAD.\" And\n          he showed me a copy of it.\n\n             I said, \"Yes, I did.\" He said, \"Why?\" And\n          I explained it to him. He said, \"Marie, I'm\n          not a racist. The real racist, you don't even\n          point your finger at the real racist.       My\n          position is to get rid of you because you were\n          hired by mistake. I get the order to get rid\n          of you, somehow get Marie out of the company.\n          But you haven't done nothing, I can't just\n          fire you, because you do nothing.\"\n\n             But he said, \"My job is to put you in the\n          position to stress you out to leave the\n          company.\" And then I asked him, I said, \"What\n          do you mean by I was hired by mistake?     He\n          stated, \"Come on, Marie. Be smart. You know\n          what I'm talking about.\" I said, \"Okay.\"\n\n          Even if we accept the attributed statements as true, they\n\nare not sufficient alone or in addition to the other alleged\n\ninstances of racial discrimination stated in the verified complaint\n\nto substantiate plaintiff's claim of racial discrimination.          They\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\ffail as a matter of law.         See, e.g., Cardona v. United Parcel\n\nService, 79 F. Supp. 2d 35, 42 (D.P.R. 2000) (noting a court should\n\nnot   accept   a   nonmovant's    \"conclusory   allegations   regarding\n\ndiscriminatory intent\").1\n\n            We agree with the district court that plaintiff failed to\n\nmake out a prima facie case of discrimination based on race and/or\n\ncountry of origin.     Accordingly, we conclude that, based on the\n\nrecord and the pleadings, the district court properly dismissed\n\nboth the federal and state law claims.\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      Paragraph 28 of the verified complaint states:\n          On July 8, 1997 MCAD found there was\n          sufficient    evidence   that   Francois    was\n          discriminated against by Putnam based on her\n          race/color     and   national    origin    and,\n          subsequently, Francois informed MCAD that she\n          would proceed with her case in court.\n     But there is no copy of such a finding in the record. Based\non our reading of the record and statements made by counsel at oral\nargument, no finding was made by the MCAD. Plaintiff claims that\nshe was told what is alleged by an employee of the MCAD.\nPlaintiff, however, does not know the name of the employee who\nsupposedly gave her the information and offers no other support for\nher contention that the MCAD made such a finding.\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

This is an appeal by\n\nplaintiff-appellant Marie Berthe Francois from a grant of summary\n\njudgment to defendant-appellee Putnam Investments, LLC.                       Plaintiff\n\nis an African-American woman whose country of origin is Haiti. She\n\nclaims   that    defendant      failed         to   promote    her   to   a   full-time\n\nposition, as promised, because of her race and national origin.\n\nThe   district    court,       in    a    well-reasoned        opinion,    found   that\n\nplaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n                                         I.    FACTS\n\n            Defendant's business is providing financial investment\n\nservices.     Plaintiff first worked for defendant as a part-time\n\ntemporary     employee     in       Putnam's        Image    Operations    Department,\n\nperforming photocopying and related tasks.                      She started work in\n\nNovember, 1994, but left her job less than a year later without\n\ngiving notice.      This would normally render her ineligible to be\n\nrehired under Putnam's employment rules.\n\n             Plaintiff applied for work again with Putnam in September\n\n1996.    Her previous employment record apparently was not noted by\n\ndefendant    because     she    was      hired      as   a   temporary    processor   in\n\nPutnam's Adjustments Department.                    As a processor, plaintiff was\n\ninvolved in data processing and making adjustments in records of\n\nvarious financial transactions.                  This work was considered to be\n\n\n                                              -2-\n\fdifficult and demanding.        Newly-hired processors received dual\n\ntraining: direct instructions and on-the-job training.             It soon\n\nbecame evident to plaintiff's supervisors that plaintiff was unable\n\nto grasp the fundamentals of the adjustments process.            Defendant\n\nused a weekly tracking system to determine the productivity and\n\naccuracy of its processors.      Plaintiff's track record showed that\n\nshe did not approach Putnam's target standards and consistently\n\nperformed below the level of her peers.\n\n             Defendant decided that plaintiff should be given the\n\nopportunity to retrain in the adjustments department in November,\n\n1996.   Three supervisors met with plaintiff and told her that if\n\nher performance improved after the retraining, she would be given\n\nthe   next   available    permanent    appointment   in   the   adjustments\n\ndepartment.    Plaintiff's retraining was not successful.         According\n\nto defendant, plaintiff also added to her work difficulties by\n\nreporting late for work on three occasions between early November\n\nand December, 1996.      She was given an early warning that lasted for\n\nthree months, until March 3, 1997.          Defendant had a policy that\n\nprohibited a temporary employee from becoming a permanent employee\n\nwhile under a disciplinary warning.\n\n             In mid-December, 1996, plaintiff filed a charge with the\n\nMassachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) alleging\n\nthat one of her supervisors, Ronald Cupples, delayed her permanent\n\nappointment, citing her lack of productivity.         Plaintiff alleges,\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fhowever,    that   this   was   only    a    pretext       to   cover   up    racial\n\ndiscrimination.    Another of her supervisors, Robbin Beauchamp, met\n\nwith plaintiff to investigate her claim of racial discrimination\n\nand discuss the MCAD charge. As quoted at length, infra, plaintiff\n\noffered two differing accounts of this conversation, from which she\n\nclaims racial discrimination against her can be found.\n\n            On January 9, 1997, Beauchamp again met with plaintiff to\n\nexplore the possibility of her being transferred to the Image\n\nOperations     Department.      According          to    Beauchamp’s    affidavit,\n\nplaintiff    did   interview    for    a     job    in    the   Image   Operations\n\nDepartment.     She was rejected for the position after she told the\n\nhiring manager that she had previously worked in the department and\n\ndid not like the management, rules, work, or atmosphere.\n\n             In late January, 1997, plaintiff was assigned to work on\n\nher   department’s    \"special    projects.\"              These   projects      were\n\nadjustments to customer accounts that were very extensive and took\n\nmuch longer than the regular process adjustments. She was assigned\n\nto work with Trisha Labonte, who reviewed and exercised quality\n\ncontrol over all of plaintiff's work.               Labonte met with plaintiff\n\nand pointed out to her that she was not doing the work properly and\n\ndid not have a good understanding of what was required.                      Labonte\n\ngave plaintiff a copy of a memo that she (Labonte) was giving to\n\nthe department supervisor.       It contained a list of five mistakes\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthat plaintiff had made on a project on which she had worked.\n\nAccording to Labonte, plaintiff signed the memo without comment.\n\n            On February 6, 1997, plaintiff expressed an interest in\n\ntwo vacant processing jobs in other departments, but was told that\n\nshe   was    ineligible     for     another      processing      position.       On\n\nFebruary 12, 1997, plaintiff resigned from Putnam. She left a note\n\non Cupples's desk, which read:\n\n            I will not be here on Friday, 2/14/97. I will\n            not have a chance to see you and say good bye.\n            If I don't, I want you to know it was a\n            pleasure to have you as my supervisor. I had\n            learn [sic] a lot from here.      I will miss\n            everybody.\n\n                                          Sincerely,\n\n\n                                          Marie Berthe Francois\n\n            Beauchamp      stated   in    an    affidavit   that    at    the   time\n\nplaintiff resigned, she told him that her husband was returning to\n\nHaiti for work and she needed to stay at home and care for their\n\nchildren.\n\n                           II.

DISCUSSION\n\n          Plaintiff asserts two claims of racial discrimination:\n\none under federal law for violation of Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964, and one under the laws of Massachusetts, Mass.\n\nGen. L. ch. 151B.   After ruling that plaintiff had not proven a\n\nprima facie case of discrimination under federal law, the district\n\ncourt dismissed the state law claim on the same grounds.\n\n          Plaintiff argues that the district erred by: failing to\n\nclosely examine the overall record and total circumstances of the\n\ncase; ignoring plaintiff's verified complaint (and sworn statement\n\nfiled with the MCAD); and improperly weighing the validity of\n\ninitial material offered as evidence.\n\n          We begin our analysis by examining the verified complaint\n\nand the sworn statement filed with the MCAD.      Under the law of this\n\ncircuit a verified complaint is treated as the\n\n          functional equivalent of an affidavit to the\n          extent that it satisfies the standards\n          explicated in Rule 56(e) (in summary judgment\n          milieu, affidavits \"shall be made on personal\n          knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would\n          be admissible in evidence, and shall show\n          affirmatively that the affiant is competent to\n          testify to the matters stated therein\").\n\n                                   -6-\n\fSkeinkopf v.

There   is   nothing   in   the    record   beyond\n\nplaintiff's self-serving statements that defendant \"was satisfied\n\nwith her productivity.\"         Indeed, the affidavits and statements\n\n                                      -7-\n\ffiled by defendant are directly contrary.           Moreover, the record\n\nshows that in the process of training for a temporary position, she\n\nquit without formal notice to defendant.         And the note she left for\n\nCupples did not contain any claims of racial discrimination;\n\nrather, it stated: \"I want you to know it was a pleasure to have\n\nyou   as   my   supervisor.\"    According   to    Beauchamp’s    affidavit,\n\nplaintiff told him that her reason for leaving was that her husband\n\nhad returned to Haiti and plaintiff had to look after their\n\nchildren.       On the record, we find it hard not to accept the\n\ndistrict    court’s    conclusion   that    an    essential     element   of\n\nplaintiff’s prima facie case is lacking - namely the existence of\n\ncredible evidence that plaintiff was qualified to perform the\n\npermanent data processing position she sought.\n\n            Moreover, even assuming plaintiff had established a prima\n\nfacie case, defendant presented overwhelming evidence that it had\n\na legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for not promoting plaintiff\n\nto a permanent position.       Evidence of pretext was simply absent.\n\nThe pleadings and pretrial material show that the only evidence of\n\nracial discrimination came from plaintiff’s conclusory allegations.\n\nThe racially discriminatory statements that plaintiff alleges were\n\nmade by Cupples and Joseph Larabee (Senior Operations Manager at\n\nPutnam who approved plaintiff’s hiring in 1996) were denied by\n\nboth.      We realize that the denials do not erase the alleged\n\nstatements and that if they were of sufficient significance to\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fwarrant a finding, the question of whether or not they were made as\n\nasserted would be a disputed issue of material fact for the\n\nfactfinder to determine.      The question for us is not credibility,\n\nbut materiality.\n\n           At   her    pretrial   deposition,   plaintiff   testified   as\n\nfollows:\n\n           Q. Can you tell me who at Putnam you think\n           was responsible for discriminating against you\n           because of your race?\n\n           A.     I don't know.     After I filed the\n           complaint, my supervisor approached me and\n           told me, \"I've got nothing to do with you,\n           Marie.   If it was for me, you'd be here\n           forever.   But I have orders from the upper\n           management to get rid of you because you were\n           hired by mistake.\"\n\n           Q.         Who told you that?\n\n           A.         Ron Kupples [sic].\n\n           Q.   He told you he was ordered to get rid of\n           you?\n\n           A. He got order [sic] from upper management\n           to get rid of me, because, \"I cannot fire you,\n           you didn't do nothing.\" He called me on the\n           December after they find [sic] out about the\n           MCAD complaint.\n\n               And then he called me not at his office,\n           not at his cube, in the conference room where\n           we always have the staff meeting. It's like a\n           private room like this one here.\n\n              He says, the first thing he asked me, \"Why\n           are you doing this, Marie? I'm not a racist.\"\n           I said, \"Then who is the racist?\" He says, \"I\n           just want you to know I get [sic] order to get\n           rid of you.    You haven't done anything.    I\n           cannot just fire you like that. But I got,\n\n                                    -9-\n\f          they give me an order to get rid           of   you\n          because you were hired by mistake.\"\n\n             I asked him, \"What do you mean by that, I\n          was hired by mistake?\"   He says to me, \"Be\n          smart, but I'm not a racist.\" I asked him,\n          \"Why did they want to get rid of me? I did\n          not do anything.\" He said, \"Be smart, Marie.\n          Come on. It's just to let you know I'm not a\n          racist.\"\n\n          Several   pages   later,   plaintiff   described   a   slightly\n\ndifferent verison of what she viewed as racial discrimination:\n\n             I thought it was going to be at his cube.\n          He said, \"No, let's go to the conference room,\n          that would be more private and confidential.\"\n          He said, \"Why are you doing this?\" I said,\n          \"What, what am I doing?\" He said, \"We find\n          out there's a complaint with the MCAD.\" And\n          he showed me a copy of it.\n\n             I said, \"Yes, I did.\" He said, \"Why?\" And\n          I explained it to him. He said, \"Marie, I'm\n          not a racist. The real racist, you don't even\n          point your finger at the real racist.       My\n          position is to get rid of you because you were\n          hired by mistake. I get the order to get rid\n          of you, somehow get Marie out of the company.\n          But you haven't done nothing, I can't just\n          fire you, because you do nothing.\"\n\n             But he said, \"My job is to put you in the\n          position to stress you out to leave the\n          company.\" And then I asked him, I said, \"What\n          do you mean by I was hired by mistake?     He\n          stated, \"Come on, Marie. Be smart. You know\n          what I'm talking about.\" I said, \"Okay.\"\n\n          Even if we accept the attributed statements as true, they\n\nare not sufficient alone or in addition to the other alleged\n\ninstances of racial discrimination stated in the verified complaint\n\nto substantiate plaintiff's claim of racial discrimination.
