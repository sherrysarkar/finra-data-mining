Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n          Boudin, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\r\n\n   Nelson Brill for the appellant.\r\n   Frank W. Hunger, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division,\r\nUnited States Department of Justice, with whom Donald E. Keener,\r\nDeputy Director, Michael P. Lindemann, Assistant Director, Karen A.\r\nHunold, Senior Litigation Counsel, and Ethan B. Kanter, Attorney,\r\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, Civil Division, United States\r\nDepartment of Justice, were on briefs, for the appellee.\r\n\nMarch 19, 1999\r\n\nLYNCH, Circuit Judge.  Joshua Wright is a native of\r\nJamaica who has been a lawful permanent resident of the United\r\nStates for over twenty years.  He is the father of several\r\nchildren, whom he supports and who are American citizens.  Wright\r\nis also a felon: a decade ago he was convicted of possessing, with\r\nintent to distribute, 2.8 grams of cocaine (worth $150.00).  He\r\nserved two years in prison and deportation proceedings were started\r\nin 1992.  At the time, Wright filed an application for\r\ndiscretionary relief from deportation, as the law then permitted\r\nhim to do, under Section 212(c) of the Immigration and\r\nNaturalization Act (the \"old INA\"), 8 U.S.C.  1182(c) (repealed\r\n1996).\r\nThe Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied such discretionary\r\nrelief in 1993, considering other evidence of misdeeds as well as\r\nthe criminal conviction, and concluded there was an insufficient\r\nshowing of rehabilitation.  The Board of Immigration Appeals\r\n(\"BIA\"), which has the discretionary power to exercise de novo\r\nreview, see Hazzard v. INS, 951 F.2d 435, 440 n.7 (1st Cir. 1991),\r\naffirmed the decision to deny discretionary relief on March 27,\r\n1996, and so the deportation order became final.\r\nCongress altered the immigration landscape with the\r\nenactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act,\r\nPub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, commonly known as AEDPA,\r\nenacted on April 24, 1996.  One day later, Wright filed a request\r\nfor a stay of deportation with the BIA, a petition for review in\r\nthis court of the final order of deportation, and a motion with the\r\nBIA to reopen his deportation case.  The motion to reopen was said\r\nto be based on evidence not previously available.\r\nUnder BIA procedures, an alien who seeks to reopen must\r\nset forth a prima facie case.  Cf. INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-\r\n05 (1988) (listing three independent, but non-exclusive, grounds on\r\nwhich the BIA may deny a petitioner's motion to reopen deportation\r\nproceedings: (1) failure to establish a prima facie case for\r\nrelief, (2) failure to introduce previously unavailable, material\r\nevidence, and (3) the BIA's determination that the petitioner would\r\nnot be entitled to the discretionary grant of relief).  Whether to\r\nallow a motion to reopen is subject to the discretion of the BIA\r\neven if the alien has made out prima facie eligibility.  See 8\r\nC.F.R.  3.2(a) (1998); Abudu, 485 U.S. at 105.\r\nHere, the BIA denied the motion to reopen on August 21,\r\n1997, saying:\r\n[T]he respondent is statutorily ineligible for such\r\nrelief as an \"alien who is deportable by reason of having\r\ncommitted any criminal offense covered in section\r\n241(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B), (C), (D), or any offense covered\r\nby section 241(a)(2)(A)(ii) for which both predicate\r\noffenses are, without regard to the date of their\r\ncommission, otherwise covered by section\r\n241(a)(2)(A)(i).\"  See Antiterrorism and Effective Death\r\nPenalty Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214\r\n(\"AEDPA\")  440(d); Matter of Soriano, Interim Decision\r\n3289 (A.G. Feb. 21, 1997).  Accordingly, the respondent\r\ncannot presently establish prima facie eligibility for\r\nthe sole form of relief requested on reopening and the\r\nmotion is denied.\r\n\nJoshua Edward Wright, No. A35-898-247, slip op. (B.I.A. Aug. 21,\r\n1997) (per curiam).  In Matter of Soriano, Interim Decision 3289,\r\n1996 WL 426888 (Op. Att'y Gen. Feb. 21, 1997), referred to by the\r\nBIA in its order denying Wright's motion to reopen, the Attorney\r\nGeneral had taken the position that the elimination of  212(c)\r\nrelief set forth in AEDPA  440(d) applied retroactively to all\r\npending petitions for such relief.\r\nIn his petition in federal court, Wright initially\r\nchallenged both the merits of the decision to withhold\r\ndiscretionary relief and the denial of his motion to reopen.  The\r\nissues have been narrowed to the effect of AEDPA  440(d) on\r\nWright's motion to reopen.\r\n                              I\r\nThe procedural history of this case is complex, a common\r\noccurrence in the aftermath of AEDPA and the Illegal Immigration\r\nReform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-\r\n208, 110 Stat. 3546 (\"IIRIRA\"), as both litigants and courts\r\nstruggle with the questions of which claims are reviewable in which\r\ncourts, if any.  See, e.g., Reno v. American-Arab Anti-\r\nDiscrimination Comm., No. 97-1252, 1999 WL 88922 (U.S. Feb. 24,\r\n1999).  Wright originally filed a petition for review of his final\r\norder of deportation with this court, as was customary pre-AEDPA\r\nunder the old INA.  Interpreting AEDPA, this court in Kolster v.\r\nINS, 101 F.3d 785 (1st Cir. 1996), earlier had held that Congress\r\nhad eliminated statutory review in the courts of appeals of the\r\nBIA's denial of certain requests for relief from deportation but\r\nthat habeas jurisdiction remained in the district courts for review\r\nof at least core constitutional issues.  See Kolster, 101 F.3d at\r\n789-91.  Accordingly, Wright's petition for review was dismissed by\r\nthis court for lack of jurisdiction.  See Wright v. INS, No. 96-\r\n1375 (1st Cir. Jan. 31, 1997).\r\nOn May 5, 1997, Wright filed a habeas petition in the\r\ndistrict court challenging both his underlying deportation order\r\nand what he viewed as the de facto denial of his motion to reopen,\r\nas the BIA had not ruled on the motion as of that date.  The\r\npetition asserted it was based on habeas jurisdiction under 28\r\nU.S.C.  2241, federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \r\n1331, and jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \r\n1651(a).  On August 21, 1997, the BIA denied Wright's motion to\r\nreopen.\r\nOn September 15, 1997, the district court dismissed the\r\npetition for lack of jurisdiction, relying on law in other circuits\r\nthat in the aftermath of AEDPA and IIRIRA there was no habeas\r\nreview of these claims under 28 U.S.C.  2241.  See Wright v.\r\nOuellette, No. 97-11035, slip op. at 6-8 (D. Mass. filed September\r\n15, 1997).  Assuming that there might be some residual\r\nconstitutional habeas jurisdiction to review constitutional claims,\r\nthe court held that the petition presented no constitutional\r\nclaims, only statutory claims.  See id. at 8-9.  As to the motion\r\nto reopen, even assuming residual jurisdiction, the court found no\r\nprobability of success because the motion was based primarily on\r\nWright's having sired two more children since he was ordered to be\r\ndeported.  See id. at 9.  The district court also denied a later\r\nmotion for reconsideration.  See Wright v. Ouellette, No. 97-11035,\r\nslip op. at 3 (D. Mass. filed Sept. 25, 1997).  Wright appealed and\r\nthis court issued a stay of deportation to consider the appeal.\r\nAfter the district court denied relief, this court\r\ndecided Goncalves v. Reno, 114 F.3d 110 (1st Cir. 1998), cert.denied, 67 U.S.L.W. 3560 (Mar. 8, 1999) (No. 98-835).  Goncalvesheld that there was habeas jurisdiction in the district courts to\r\nconsider a basic statutory interpretation claim by an alien   who\r\nwas in the process of having his  212(c) application for relief\r\nheard by the BIA before the application was dismissed on the\r\ngrounds of Soriano   and that the Attorney General's interpretation\r\nof the retroactivity of certain provisions of the statute was in\r\nerror.  See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 119-22, 126-33.  Goncalves held\r\nthat Congress did not intend, contrary to the Attorney General's\r\ninterpretation in Soriano, to apply the elimination of  212(c)\r\nrelief to certain aliens such as Goncalves whose applications for\r\ndiscretionary relief under the old INA  212(c) were then pending\r\nbefore the BIA as of the date of enactment of AEDPA.  See id. at\r\n131.\r\n                   II\r\nIn the aftermath of Goncalves, the parties agree that\r\njurisdiction is not a contested issue and that this case has been\r\nnarrowed to this issue:  Whether Congress intended AEDPA  440(d)\r\nto preclude the BIA from granting petitions to reopen such as\r\npresented by Wright.\r\nWe pause to be clear about what is not presented.  As the\r\ndistrict court correctly held, Wright presents no colorable claim\r\nthat his deportation order was unconstitutional, and the\r\ndeportation order itself and the correctness of the initial\r\ndecision to deny  212(c) relief are not before us.\r\nThe respondent Attorney General, recognizing that this\r\nCourt in Goncalves disagreed with the Attorney General's decision\r\nin Soriano, does not base her position   that the BIA order denying\r\nthe motion to reopen is correct   on Soriano.  Rather, respondent\r\nargues that application of AEDPA  440(d) to motions to reopen is\r\nnot a retroactive application of the statute, relying on Landgrafv. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994).  The Attorney General\r\nalso points to an obvious difference between this case and\r\nGoncalves:  here the motion to reopen before the agency was filed\r\nafter the effective date of AEDPA and after the alien had had full\r\nagency consideration of his  212(c) application.  The Attorney\r\nGeneral argues that all proceedings before the BIA had concluded\r\nand the order of deportation had become final, and thus the motion\r\nto reopen does not raise questions of retroactivity.\r\n   Wright's primary argument is that there is a\r\nretroactivity problem presented here because, he says, a motion to\r\nreopen is simply an extension of the original application and thus\r\nshould be considered to relate back to the original application,\r\nfiled before AEDPA's enactment.  Under Goncalves, he then says, the\r\nmotion to reopen, as a pending motion for  212(c) relief before\r\nthe BIA, should at least have been considered on its merits.\r\n   The matter is not resolved by our opinion in Goncalves,\r\nwhich involved a clear question of retroactive application of\r\nAEDPA's cutoff of  212(c) relief to a  212(c) application which\r\nhad not yet been heard by the BIA.  Goncalves thus involved a stage\r\nbefore there was a final agency determination of an application\r\nwhich was pending at the time AEDPA was adopted.  See Goncalves,\r\n144 F.3d at 112-13.  The question still remains, post-Goncalves, as\r\nto whether Congress, in enacting AEDPA  440(d), intended to permit\r\nan alien to file a motion to reopen an adverse BIA decision denying\r\n212(c) relief after AEDPA's effective date.  It is clear that\r\nCongress intended to preclude applications for  212(c) relief\r\nprospectively.  See id. at 132.\r\n   Whether the motion to reopen is subject to AEDPA's cutoff\r\nof  212(c) relief is a question of Congressional intent.  We agree\r\nthat the case turns on the characterization of a motion to reopen\r\nand the understanding against which Congress enacted AEDPA.  SeeLorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978) (\"Congress is presumed\r\nto be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a\r\nstatute . . . .\"); see also Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 133 (utilizing\r\nthis presumption to help determine Congressional intent regarding\r\nthe retroactive application of AEDPA  440(d)).\r\n   Without rehearsing the whole of retroactivity law, we\r\nthink it is clear that the special rule adopted by the Supreme\r\nCourt as to finality of orders of deportation dooms Wright's\r\nargument.  In Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386 (1995), the Supreme Court\r\nheld that a timely motion to the BIA for reconsideration of a BIA\r\ndecision affirming an IJ's order of deportation does not toll the\r\nrunning of the period for seeking judicial review of the final\r\ndeportation order.  See id. at 405-06.  Stone disapproved of the\r\nholdings of several circuits that the normal tolling rule based on\r\nmotions to reconsider in other forms of agency orders also applied\r\nin the immigration context.  See id. at 389, 392.  That normal\r\nrule, available under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \r\n704, and the Hobbs Administrative Orders Review Act, 28 U.S.C. \r\n2341-2351, was that \"[t]he timely filing of a motion to reconsider\r\nrenders the underlying order nonfinal for purposes of judicial\r\nreview.\"  Stone, 514 U.S. at 392.  The Stone court concluded that\r\nthe 1990 amendments to the INA meant that \"Congress intended to\r\ndepart from the conventional tolling rule in deportation cases.\" \r\nId. at 398.  The rationale of the holding is important for our\r\npurposes.  The Court's holding stated its view of Congressional\r\n\"understanding that a deportation order [after BIA affirmance of an\r\nIJ's order of deportation] is final, and reviewable, when issued.\" \r\nId. at 405.\r\n   That this case involves a motion to reopen instead of a\r\nmotion to reconsider makes no difference.  The Stone Court noted\r\nthe agency's long-standing view that a motion to reconsider a BIA\r\naffirmance of a deportation order does not serve to stay a\r\ndeportation order.  See id. at 398.  \"Its finality is not affected\r\nby the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider.\"  Id. at 405. \r\nThe same is true for motions to reopen.  See 8 C.F.R.  3.2(f)\r\n(noting that, except for certain orders entered in absentia, \"the\r\nfiling of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not\r\nstay the execution of any decision made in the case\").  Indeed, the\r\nINS treats the subjects of motions to reconsider and motions to\r\nreopen under the same regulation.  See 8 C.F.R.  3.2.  Both the\r\npetitioner and the INS in Stone treated motions for reconsideration\r\nthe same as motions to reopen.  See Stone, 514 U.S. at 389-90.  The\r\nfinality of the deportation order here is not affected by the\r\nfiling of the subsequent motion to reopen.\r\n   Congress enacted AEDPA  440(d) against the backdrop of\r\nthe Stone case and the \"longstanding view of the INS . . . that a\r\nmotion for reconsideration does not serve to stay the deportation\r\norder.\"  Id. at 398.  Because the deportation order here, issued\r\nafter full BIA consideration of Wright's application, was final,\r\nthe motion to reopen is more akin to starting a new proceeding. \r\nIndeed, Wright's motion to reopen is based on new evidence. \r\nCongress was no doubt mindful in AEDPA  440(d) of the practical\r\nconsequences which would flow if motions filed after the effective\r\ndate of AEDPA to reopen final orders of deportation (stemming from\r\nthe BIA's affirmance of denial of  212(c) relief) were treated as\r\nan exception to its elimination of  212(c) relief.  See Stone, 514\r\nU.S. 398-400 (describing problems of delay and the related problem\r\nof successive administrative appeals and motions).  This case,\r\nthus, does not involve a problem of retroactivity, and Wright's\r\nappeal from the denial of his petition for habeas corpus is\r\ndismissed and the stay of deportation is vacated.  \r\n   So ordered.\n",

The petition asserted it was based on habeas jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241, federal question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331, and jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651(a).  On August 21, 1997, the BIA denied Wright's motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 15, 1997, the district court dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction, relying on law in other circuits that in the aftermath of AEDPA and IIRIRA there was no habeas review of these claims under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2241.  See Wright v. Ouellette, No. 97-11035, slip op. at 6-8 (D. Mass. filed September 15, 1997).  Assuming that there might be some residual constitutional habeas jurisdiction to review constitutional claims, the court held that the petition presented no constitutional claims, only statutory claims.  See id. at 8-9.   As to the motion to reopen, even assuming residual jurisdiction, the court found no probability of success because the motion was based primarily on Wright's having sired two more children since he was ordered to be deported.  See id. at 9. The district court also denied a later motion for reconsideration.  See Wright v. Ouellette, No. 97-11035, slip op. at 3 (D. Mass. filed Sept. 25, 1997).  Wright appealed and this court issued a stay of deportation to consider the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court denied relief, this court decided Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110 (1st Cir.1998), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 119 S.Ct. 1140, 143 L.Ed.2d 208 (1999).  Goncalves held that there was habeas jurisdiction in the district courts to consider a basic statutory interpretation claim by an alien--who was in the process of having his &#167; 212(c) application for relief heard by the BIA before the application was dismissed on the grounds of Soriano--and that the Attorney General's interpretation of the retroactivity of certain provisions of the statute was in error.  See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 119-22, 126-33.  Goncalves held that Congress did not intend, contrary to the Attorney General's interpretation in Soriano, to apply the elimination of &#167; 212(c) relief to certain aliens such as Goncalves whose applications for discretionary relief under the old INA &#167; 212(c) were then pending before the BIA as of the date of enactment of AEDPA.  See id. at 131.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the aftermath of Goncalves, the parties agree that jurisdiction is not a contested issue and that this case has been narrowed to this issue:  Whether Congress intended AEDPA &#167; 440(d) to preclude the BIA from granting petitions to reopen such as presented by Wright.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We pause to be clear about what is not presented.  As the district court correctly held, Wright presents no colorable claim that his deportation order was unconstitutional, and the deportation order itself and the correctness of the initial decision to deny &#167; 212(c) relief are not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent Attorney General, recognizing that this Court in Goncalves disagreed with the Attorney General's decision in Soriano, does not base her position--that the BIA order denying the motion to reopen is correct--on Soriano.   Rather, respondent argues<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that application of AEDPA &#167; 440(d) to motions to reopen is not a retroactive application of the statute, relying on Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).  The Attorney General also points to an obvious difference between this case and Goncalves:  here the motion to reopen before the agency was filed after the effective date of AEDPA and after the alien had had full agency consideration of his &#167; 212(c) application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Attorney General argues that all proceedings before the BIA had concluded and the order of deportation had become final, and thus the motion to reopen does not raise questions of retroactivity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wright's primary argument is that there is a retroactivity problem presented here because, he says, a motion to reopen is simply an extension of the original application and thus should be considered to relate back to the original application, filed before AEDPA's enactment.  Under Goncalves, he then says, the motion to reopen, as a pending motion for &#167; 212(c) relief before the BIA, should at least have been considered on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The matter is not resolved by our opinion in Goncalves, which involved a clear question of retroactive application of AEDPA's cutoff of &#167; 212(c) relief to a &#167; 212(c) application which had not yet been heard by the BIA.  Goncalves thus involved a stage before there was a final agency determination of an application which was pending at the time AEDPA was adopted.  See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 112-13.   The question still remains, post-Goncalves, as to whether Congress, in enacting AEDPA &#167; 440(d), intended to permit an alien to file a motion to reopen an adverse BIA decision denying &#167; 212(c) relief after AEDPA's effective date.  It is clear that Congress intended to preclude applications for &#167; 212(c) relief prospectively.  See id. at 132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the motion to reopen is subject to AEDPA's cutoff of &#167; 212(c) relief is a question of Congressional intent.  We agree that the case turns on the characterization of a motion to reopen and the understanding against which Congress enacted AEDPA.  See Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580, 98 S.Ct. 866, 55 L.Ed.2d 40 (1978) (\"Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute ....\");  see also Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 133 (utilizing this presumption to help determine Congressional intent regarding the retroactive application of AEDPA &#167; 440(d)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without rehearsing the whole of retroactivity law, we think it is clear that the special rule adopted by the Supreme Court as to finality of orders of deportation dooms Wright's argument.  In Stone v. INS, 514 U.S. 386, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995), the Supreme Court held that a timely motion to the BIA for reconsideration of a BIA decision affirming an IJ's order of deportation does not toll the running of the period for seeking judicial review of the final deportation order. See id. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. 1537.  Stone disapproved of the holdings of several circuits that the normal tolling rule based on motions to reconsider in other forms of agency orders also applied in the immigration context.  See id. at 389, 392, 115 S.Ct. 1537.   That normal rule, available under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 704, and the Hobbs Administrative Orders Review Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2341-2351, was that \"[t]he timely filing of a motion to reconsider renders the underlying order nonfinal for purposes of judicial review.\"  Stone, 514 U.S. at 392, 115 S.Ct. 1537.   The Stone court concluded that the 1990 amendments to the INA meant that \"Congress intended to depart from the conventional tolling rule in deportation cases.\"  Id. at 398, 115 S.Ct. 1537.   The rationale of the holding is important for our purposes.  The Court's holding stated its view of Congressional \"understanding that a deportation order [after BIA affirmance of an IJ's order of deportation] is final, and reviewable, when issued.\"  Id. at 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That this case involves a motion to reopen instead of a motion to reconsider makes no difference.  The Stone Court noted the agency's long-standing view that a motion to reconsider a BIA affirmance of a deportation order does not serve to stay a deportation order.  See id. at 398, 115 S.Ct. 1537.  \"Its finality is not affected by the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider.\"  Id. at 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537.   The same is true for motions to reopen.  See 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(f) (noting that, except for certain orders entered in absentia, \"the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not stay the execution of any decision made in the case\").  Indeed, the INS treats the subjects of motions to reconsider and motions to reopen under the same regulation.  See 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2.  Both the petitioner and the INS in Stone treated motions for reconsideration the same as motions to reopen.  See Stone, 514 U.S. at 389-90, 115 S.Ct. 1537.   The finality of the deportation order here is not affected by the filing of the subsequent motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted AEDPA &#167; 440(d) against the backdrop of the Stone case and the \"longstanding view of the INS ... that a motion for reconsideration does not serve to stay the deportation order.\"  Id. at 398, 115 S.Ct. 1537.   Because the deportation order here, issued after full BIA consideration of Wright's application, was final, the motion to reopen is more akin to starting a new proceeding.  Indeed, Wright's motion to reopen is based on new evidence.  Congress was no doubt mindful in AEDPA &#167; 440(d) of the practical consequences which would flow if motions filed after the effective date of AEDPA to reopen final orders of deportation (stemming from the BIA's affirmance of denial of &#167; 212(c) relief) were treated as an exception to its elimination of &#167; 212(c) relief.  See Stone, 514 U.S. at 398-400, 115 S.Ct. 1537 (describing problems of delay and the related problem of successive administrative appeals and motions).  This case, thus, does not involve a problem of retroactivity, and the district court's dismissal of Wright's petition for habeas corpus is affirmed and the stay of deportation is vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the government has briefed an argument that the applicability of AEDPA &#167; 440(d) (which eliminated &#167; 212(c) discretionary applications) does not turn on the date of the criminal conduct and/or convictions being pre-AEDPA, Wright does not make such an argument in support of his position and so we do not address it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Attorney General also points out that unlike the initial &#167; 212(c) petition itself, for which there was statutory authority, there is no statutory authority for a motion to reopen.  There is only statutory authority directing the Attorney General to promulgate regulations limiting the number of motions to reopen that an alien could file.  See Immigration Act of 1990 &#167; 545(b), Pub.L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 5048;  see also INS v. Doherty, 502 U.S. 314, 322, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992) (\"There is no statutory provision for reopening of a deportation proceeding, and the authority for such motions derives solely from regulations promulgated by the Attorney General.\").  Motions to reopen are a creature created by administrative regulation.  See INS v. Jong Ha Wang, 450 U.S. 139, 140-41, 101 S.Ct. 1027, 67 L.Ed.2d 123 (1981) (per curiam).  We decide this case without addressing whether there is significance to the fact that motions to reopen are a matter of administrative, rather than legislative, grace</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

He served two years in prison and deportation proceedings were started in 1992.

As to the motion to reopen, even assuming residual jurisdiction, the court found no probability of success because the motion was based primarily on Wright's having sired two more children since he was ordered to be deported.

See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 119-22, 126-33.  Goncalves held that Congress did not intend, contrary to the Attorney General's interpretation in Soriano, to apply the elimination of &#167; 212(c) relief to certain aliens such as Goncalves whose applications for discretionary relief under the old INA &#167; 212(c) were then pending before the BIA as of the date of enactment of AEDPA.

As the district court correctly held, Wright presents no colorable claim that his deportation order was unconstitutional, and the deportation order itself and the correctness of the initial decision to deny &#167; 212(c) relief are not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent Attorney General, recognizing that this Court in Goncalves disagreed with the Attorney General's decision in Soriano, does not base her position--that the BIA order denying the motion to reopen is correct--on Soriano.   Rather, respondent argues<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> that application of AEDPA &#167; 440(d) to motions to reopen is not a retroactive application of the statute, relying on Landgraf v. USI Film Products, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Attorney General also points to an obvious difference between this case and Goncalves:  here the motion to reopen before the agency was filed after the effective date of AEDPA and after the alien had had full agency consideration of his &#167; 212(c) application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The Attorney General argues that all proceedings before the BIA had concluded and the order of deportation had become final, and thus the motion to reopen does not raise questions of retroactivity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wright's primary argument is that there is a retroactivity problem presented here because, he says, a motion to reopen is simply an extension of the original application and thus should be considered to relate back to the original application, filed before AEDPA's enactment.  Under Goncalves, he then says, the motion to reopen, as a pending motion for &#167; 212(c) relief before the BIA, should at least have been considered on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The matter is not resolved by our opinion in Goncalves, which involved a clear question of retroactive application of AEDPA's cutoff of &#167; 212(c) relief to a &#167; 212(c) application which had not yet been heard by the BIA.  Goncalves thus involved a stage before there was a final agency determination of an application which was pending at the time AEDPA was adopted.  See Goncalves, 144 F.3d at 112-13.   The question still remains, post-Goncalves, as to whether Congress, in enacting AEDPA &#167; 440(d), intended to permit an alien to file a motion to reopen an adverse BIA decision denying &#167; 212(c) relief after AEDPA's effective date.  It is clear that Congress intended to preclude applications for &#167; 212(c) relief prospectively.  See id. at 132.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether the motion to reopen is subject to AEDPA's cutoff of &#167; 212(c) relief is a question of Congressional intent.  We agree that the case turns on the characterization of a motion to reopen and the understanding against which Congress enacted AEDPA.  See Lorillard v. Pons, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109777\"><a href=\"/opinion/109777/lorillard-v-pons/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">575</span></a></span>, 580, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109777\"><a href=\"/opinion/109777/lorillard-v-pons/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Stone v. INS, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span> (1995), the Supreme Court held that a timely motion to the BIA for reconsideration of a BIA decision affirming an IJ's order of deportation does not toll the running of the period for seeking judicial review of the final deportation order. See id. at 405-06, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span>.  Stone disapproved of the holdings of several circuits that the normal tolling rule based on motions to reconsider in other forms of agency orders also applied in the immigration context.  See id. at 389, 392, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span>.   That normal rule, available under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 704, and the Hobbs Administrative Orders Review Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2341-2351, was that \"[t]he timely filing of a motion to reconsider renders the underlying order nonfinal for purposes of judicial review.\"  Stone, 514 U.S. at 392, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span>.   The Stone court concluded that the 1990 amendments to the INA meant that \"Congress intended to depart from the conventional tolling rule in deportation cases.\"  Id. at 398, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span>.   The rationale of the holding is important for our purposes.  The Court's holding stated its view of Congressional \"understanding that a deportation order [after BIA affirmance of an IJ's order of deportation] is final, and reviewable, when issued.\"  Id. at 405, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That this case involves a motion to reopen instead of a motion to reconsider makes no difference.  The Stone Court noted the agency's long-standing view that a motion to reconsider a BIA affirmance of a deportation order does not serve to stay a deportation order.  See id. at 398, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span>.  \"Its finality is not affected by the subsequent filing of a motion to reconsider.\"  Id. at 405, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span>.   The same is true for motions to reopen.  See 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2(f) (noting that, except for certain orders entered in absentia, \"the filing of a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider shall not stay the execution of any decision made in the case\").  Indeed, the INS treats the subjects of motions to reconsider and motions to reopen under the same regulation.  See 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.2.  Both the petitioner and the INS in Stone treated motions for reconsideration the same as motions to reopen.  See Stone, 514 U.S. at 389-90, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span>.   The finality of the deportation order here is not affected by the filing of the subsequent motion to reopen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress enacted AEDPA &#167; 440(d) against the backdrop of the Stone case and the \"longstanding view of the INS ... that a motion for reconsideration does not serve to stay the deportation order.\"  Id. at 398, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span>.   Because the deportation order here, issued after full BIA consideration of Wright's application, was final, the motion to reopen is more akin to starting a new proceeding.  Indeed, Wright's motion to reopen is based on new evidence.  Congress was no doubt mindful in AEDPA &#167; 440(d) of the practical consequences which would flow if motions filed after the effective date of AEDPA to reopen final orders of deportation (stemming from the BIA's affirmance of denial of &#167; 212(c) relief) were treated as an exception to its elimination of &#167; 212(c) relief.  See Stone, 514 U.S. at 398-400, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117922\"><a href=\"/opinion/117922/stone-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1537</span></a></span> (describing problems of delay and the related problem of successive administrative appeals and motions).  This case, thus, does not involve a problem of retroactivity, and the district court's dismissal of Wright's petition for habeas corpus is affirmed and the stay of deportation is vacated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So ordered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the government has briefed an argument that the applicability of AEDPA &#167; 440(d) (which eliminated &#167; 212(c) discretionary applications) does not turn on the date of the criminal conduct and/or convictions being pre-AEDPA, Wright does not make such an argument in support of his position and so we do not address it</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The Attorney General also points out that unlike the initial &#167; 212(c) petition itself, for which there was statutory authority, there is no statutory authority for a motion to reopen.  There is only statutory authority directing the Attorney General to promulgate regulations limiting the number of motions to reopen that an alien could file.  See Immigration Act of 1990 &#167; 545(b), Pub.L. No. 101-649, 104 Stat. 5048;  see also INS v.
