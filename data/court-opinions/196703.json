Michael Ponsor, U.S. District Judge]\r                                                               \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Torruella, Chief Judge\r                                                      \r\n                Cyr and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r                                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nAlonzo Alzate-Yepez on brief pro se.\r                               \r\nDonald  K. Stern,  United  States Attorney,  and  Andrew  Levchuk,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.   After careful review  of the parties'\r                                \r\n\nbriefs and the limited appellate record, we conclude that the\r\n\ndistrict court  properly denied appellant's 28  U.S.C.   2255\r\n\npetition.  \r\n\n          Appellant's claims fail procedurally because he did\r\n\nnot raise them either at the time  of sentencing or on direct\r\n\nappeal.   See  United  States v.  Frady,  456 U.S.  152,  165\r                                                   \r\n\n(1982).  To  the extent  that appellant is  arguing that  his\r\n\ntrial attorney provided ineffective assistance by  failing to\r\n\nmove  for a  downward  departure, that  argument lacks  merit\r\n\nbecause there is no legal or evidentiary support here for any\r\n\nsuch departure.\r\n\n          Appellant's claim for a downward departure based on\r\n\nhis status  as a  deportable alien  is without  merit. First,\r\n\nappellant's statutory mandatory  minimum sentence may not  be\r\n\nreduced.    See  U.S.S.G.    5G1.1(c)(2);  United  States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nRodriguez,  938 F.2d 319, 320  (1st Cir. 1991).   Second, the\r                     \r\n\ndistrict  court  stated that,  even if  it  had the  power to\r\n\ndepart,  it would not have done so.   \"It is by now axiomatic\r\n\nthat  a  criminal defendant  cannot  ground  an  appeal on  a\r\n\nsentencing court's discretionary decision not to depart below\r\n\nthe guideline sentencing range.\"  United States v. Pierro, 32\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d  611, 619 (1st Cir.  1994), cert. denied,  115 S.Ct. 919\r                                                         \r\n\n(1995). \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n          Appellant's  claim  regarding   the  safety   valve\r\n\nprovision  fails because the  district court  determined that\r\n\nappellant did  not cooperate with the  government as required\r\n\nunder 18 U.S.C.   3553(f)(5) and U.S.S.G.   5C1.2.  Appellant\r\n\nhas   submitted   nothing   that   challenges   that  factual\r\n\ndetermination.  \r\n\n          Appellant's  claims regarding the amount of cocaine\r\n\nand  his role in the offense were  not raised in the petition\r\n\naddressed in this appeal,  and so we will not  consider those\r\n\nclaims.  See United  States v. Jackson, 3 F.3d  506, 511 (1st\r                                                  \r\n\nCir. 1993).  \r\n\n          Finally, as appellant has not pursued on appeal his\r\n\nclaim that he  should have received  three, rather than  two,\r\n\npoints for  acceptance of responsibility, we  deem that claim\r\n\nto have been waived.\r\n\n          Affirmed.  Loc. R. 27.1.\r                              \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
