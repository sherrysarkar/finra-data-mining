This appeal challenges\r                    POLLAK, Senior  District Judge.\r                                                  \r\n\nthe  conviction and  the  subsequent  sentence  of  Edwin  Fortes\r\n\n(a.k.a.  Charles Brookshire).  A four-count indictment, handed up\r\n\non December 6,  1995, charged that on January 13, 1994 Fortes (1)\r\n\nwas a felon  in possession of firearms and  ammunition (18 U.S.C.\r\n\n  922(g)(1));  (2) possessed a firearm with an obliterated serial\r\n\nnumber (18 U.S.C.   922(k)); (3) possessed cocaine with intent to\r\n\ndistribute  (21 U.S.C.    841(a)(1));  and (4)  used and  carried\r\n\nfirearms during  and in  connection with  the cocaine  possession\r\n\nalleged in  count 3 (18 U.S.C.   924(c)(1)).   Prior to trial the\r\n\nfourth count  was dropped. In  May of 1996, having  waived a jury\r\n\ntrial, Fortes was tried to the bench on counts 1, 2 and 3.  After\r\n\na week's trial Fortes was found guilty on all three counts.  \r\n\n          Fortes  was sentenced  in July  of  1996. Finding  that\r\n\nunder count 1 -- felon in possession of firearms and ammunition -\r\n\n- Fortes was subject to  enhanced penalties pursuant to the Armed\r\n\nCareer Criminal Act (ACCA), 18  U.S.C.   924(e)(1), and the armed\r\n\ncareer  criminal  sentencing  guideline,  U.S.S.G.    4B1.4,  the\r\n\ndistrict court sentenced Fortes to a prison term of 262 months on\r\n\ncount 1.  The district court also imposed concurrent sentences of\r\n\n60 months on count 2 and 262 months on count 3.\r\n\n          On  appeal  Fortes  challenges several  aspects  of his\r\n\nconviction  and sentence.   Two  of  the issues  he raises  merit\r\n\ndiscussion.  To these we now turn.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n                                I.\r\n\n          Fortes  argues that findings made by the district court\r\n\nin connection with the conviction  under count 3 -- possession of\r\n\ncocaine with  intent  to distribute  -- are  incompatible with  a\r\n\nverdict of guilty.  Fortes' precise contention is that certain of\r\n\nthe  district  court's  findings  are  directly at  odds  with  a\r\n\nconclusion  that, within the intendment of 21 U.S.C.   841(a)(1),\r\n\nhe \"knowingly\" possessed the particular  units of cocaine that he\r\n\nwas charged with possessing. \r\n\n          The cocaine  in question  consisted of  nine \"jums\"  --\r\n\nwrapped packages of  crack. Law enforcement officers  executing a\r\n\nsearch  warrant on January 13,  1994, at Fortes' aunt's apartment\r\n\nat 5  Cardington Street in  the Roxbury section of  Boston, found\r\n\nthe  jums  on a  bureau  located in  a  guest room  frequented by\r\n\nFortes.1 The search marked  the culmination of several  months of\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1    The  district  court s  findings  with  respect  to  Fortes \r\nconnection with  the  guest room  in  his aunt s  apartment  were\r\nthese:\r\n\n            The execution of the search warrant yielded\r\n          not  only  the  evidence  of  the  contraband\r\n          itself but evidence that established, I think\r\n          powerfully, the  defendant s presence  in the\r\n          premises  on  the first  floor  of Cardington\r\n          Street  and  his  ability  and  intention  to\r\n          exercise control  over items in what has been\r\n          variously called the  guest room or  Chucky s\r\n          room, that is, the  room on the right as  you\r\n          enter the building.\r\n\n            In  particular, there was a large number of\r\n          defendant s  personal papers.   They  weren t\r\n          simply  historical  papers,   but  they  were\r\n          current operational papers.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nlaw enforcement efforts  inquiring into drug-and-firearms-related\r\n\nactivities  of Fortes and others at  the Roxbury apartment. These\r\n\nlaw enforcement efforts included two controlled drug transactions\r\n\nin  which  cocaine  was  sold  at  the  Roxbury  apartment  to  a\r\n\nconfidential informant: in the first transaction, in September of\r\n\n1993, Fortes was the seller;  in the second transaction, in early\r\n\nJanuary of 1994, a Fortes confederate was the seller. \r\n\n          The district  court made extended findings with respect\r\n\nto  the three  counts of  conviction  -- felon  in possession  of\r\n\nfirearms   and  ammunition;  possession  of  a  firearm  with  an\r\n\nobliterated  serial number; and possession of cocaine with intent\r\n\nto distribute. In order fairly to assess Fortes' challenge to his\r\n\nconviction on the cocaine-possession count it will  be helpful to\r\n\nquote  the entirety  of  the district  court's  findings on  that\r\n\ncount.  To place those findings in proper context, the concluding\r\n\nportions  of the  district court's  preceding  discussion --  the\r\n\ndiscussion of the two firearms counts -- will also be set forth:\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n            Among the  papers  were his  current  --  I\r\n          think the  most recent  one was  in December,\r\n          report   to  his   probation  officer   which\r\n          included  copies  of   his  paychecks  earned\r\n          through the month  of December and,  I think,\r\n          in fact,  into January, indicating  that even\r\n          in January  1994, defendant had a present and\r\n          ongoing connection with that room by treating\r\n          it  as a repository  for papers that  were of\r\n          some importance to him.\r\n\n            I  may  note  that  the  defendant  in  his\r\n          probation reports or reports to the probation\r\n          supervising probation  officer reported  that\r\n          his residence was 5 Cardington Street.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n          So  with  respect to  Count  1,  I find  that  the\r\n     defendant did have constructive possession of the items\r\n     alleged in Count 1.\r\n\n          Now, let me just say that possession may well have\r\n     been  joint.   I'm  not  called  upon to  decide  fully\r\n     whether  it  was  joint.    It's  sufficient  that  the\r\n     defendant has possession.   The evidence does  indicate\r\n     that it was  joint with others, perhaps,  because other\r\n     people came and went at the same time.\r\n\n          And,  of course, question  of ownership is  not at\r\n     issue.    Possession  is to  be  determined  apart from\r\n     ownership, some preference  as to whose guns  they were\r\n     and that is, I think, legally beside the point.\r\n\n          With respect to  Count 2, Count  2 relates to  the\r\n     weapon  with the obliterated  serial number.   That was\r\n     the Interdynamic semiautomatic pistol.  It was found in\r\n     the right-hand bedroom  and is one of the  items that I\r\n     conclude   the   defendant   constructively   possessed\r\n     knowingly.\r\n\n          I reach essentially similar conclusion [sic]  with\r                                                               \r\n     respect  to   Count  3  which   alleges  the  defendant\r\n     possessed  a  controlled substance  knowingly  with the\r\n     intent to distribute it.\r\n\n          First  of  all, I  think  it's clear  that  it's a\r\n     controlled  substance.  I've read the  report of one of\r\n     the items.  I don't know if  it matters the other [sic]\r                                                                     \r\n     weren't  analyzed, whether the  one is cocaine  base, I\r\n     don't think  it matters  the others are  not.   I don't\r\n     think it matters.\r\n\n          Applying the  same  principles  of  possession,  I\r\n     would conclude from defendant's participation in a drug\r\n     sale in September that he knew  that was a drug-selling\r\n     place  and that  he  intended  to  participate  in  it,\r\n     intended to possess  the drugs that were  available for\r\n     sale within the premises from time to time; and that as\r\n     a willing, knowing  participant in  that conspiracy  to\r\n     sell drugs as well as firearms, the defendant knew that\r\n     drugs, particularly  cocaine base,  would be  available\r\n     and would be sold.\r\n\n          And I find  further that he  had the intention  to\r\n     exercise control over -- perhaps jointly with others --\r\n     over such  drugs as were  in the apartment for  sale at\r\n     any given time through the date of the indictment, date\r\n     alleged in the indictment.  I'm sorry, through the date\r\n     alleged in the Count 3 in the indictment.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n          I may say  that I do not find  that the government\r\n     has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\r\n     knew of these  specific nine items being on  top of the\r\n     bureau at the particular time.\r\n\n          There's  not evidence that the defendant was there\r\n     in such a  time -- in proximity  to the search  that he\r\n     knew  specifically  that there  were  nine individually\r\n     wrapped jums on top of the bureau.\r\n\n          I  don't think  that is  necessary  because of  my\r\n     conclusion that  he knew of  the presence of  crack for\r\n     sale  in the premises generally and intended to possess\r\n     that which was present.\r\n\n          But to  the extent  that may  make any  difference\r\n     legally, I mention that; and I'm not convinced that  he\r\n     knew of  those specific items.  And I distinguish those\r\n     from  the firearms, for  example, because I  think much\r\n     more  likelihood,  likely that  that  was a  transitory\r\n     condition,  that nine  individually  wrapped jum  doses\r\n     would  not remain  very long  on  the top  of a  bureau\r\n     whereas I think  firearms stored in safes and behind --\r\n     in  briefcases behind cabinets,  so on, so  forth, were\r\n     there for longer term storage.\r\n\n          But it's  not clear who  in the events of  the day\r\n     may have deposited  those individual  packages and  for\r\n     how  long  they were  there.    I  could not  find  the\r\n     defendant knew of those specifically, but I don't think\r\n     that's necessary to the proof.\r\n\n          I think that it's sufficient for the government to\r\n     have proved participation  in the conspiracy  which was\r\n     the sale of  cocaine, cocaine base, knowing  that there\r\n     would be a supply  and that intended to participate  in\r\n     that by  possessing  and exercising  control  over  the\r\n     supply as it may been from time to time.\r\n\n          I find  further that  possession by  the defendant\r\n     was with the intent to distribute.  I find from all the\r\n     evidence that sales  was [sic] going on,  including his\r                                            \r\n     own participation in the sale and in  addition from the\r\n     evidence the defendant  himself did not use  cocaine or\r\n     cocaine  base  so  that  the  element  --  I  find  the\r\n     government  has  proved  possession with  intention  to\r\n     distribute.\r\n\n          Fortes  argues that  the key  to  the district  court's\r\n\nfinding  that  he knowingly  possessed  cocaine  was \"that  as  a\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nwilling, knowing participant in that  conspiracy to sell drugs as\r\n\nwell as  firearms, the  defendant knew  that drugs,  particularly\r\n\ncocaine base, would be available and would be sold.\"  Fortes goes\r\n\non to  point out that he was not  charged with participation in a\r\n\nconspiracy.       In   arguing    that   the   district   court's\r\n\ncharacterization of him  as a conspirator undercuts  the district\r\n\ncourt's  verdict on the possession count, Fortes invokes language\r\n\nof  this court in  United States v.  Zavala Maldonado,  23 F.3d 4\r                                                               \r\n\n(1st  Cir.), cert.  denied, 115  S.  Ct. 451  (1994).   Defendant\r                                    \r\n\nZavala --  like Fortes  in the case  at bar  -- was  charged with\r\n\npossession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  And in Zavala's\r\n\ncase,  we   pointed  out   that,  \"given   that  these   offenses\r\n\n[conspiracy,  and  aiding  and  abetting  an  attempt]  were  not\r\n\ncharged,  it  is  hardly  sufficient  to  say  that  this  record\r                                                                   \r\n\ncontained evidence to  support such a  conviction,\" and we  there\r\n\nwent on  to state that  \"the conviction for possession  can stand\r\n\nonly if a reasonable jury could find that Zavala did possess  the\r\n\ncocaine within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.   841.\"  Id. at 6.\r                                                             \r\n\n          It  is  true that  here,  as  in Zavala  Maldonado,  no\r                                                                      \r\n\nconspiracy charge was laid against  the defendant.  Thus here, as\r\n\nthere,  a   charge  of   possession  could   not  be  proved   by\r\n\ndemonstrating vicarious accountability --  i.e., possession by  a\r\n\nco-conspirator  is  not  possession by  the  defendant  where the\r\n\ndefendant has  not been charged  with conspiracy.   But --  as in\r\n\nZavala  Maldonado, so here -- proof of the defendant's possession\r                           \r\n\nrested  on  the defendant's  own  conduct,  not  on that  of  co-\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nconspirators.  To be sure, in the case at bar the  district court\r\n\nreferred to Fortes' participation in a \"conspiracy to  sell drugs\r\n\nas well  as firearms,\"  but the district  court also  referred to\r\n\n\"defendant's  participation in  a  drug  sale  in  September  [of\r\n\n1993],\"  a datum  from  which the  district  court inferred  that\r\n\nFortes \"knew that  was a drug-selling place and  that he intended\r\n\nto participate  in it,  intended to possess  the drugs  that were\r\n\navailable  for  sale within  the  premises  from time  to  time.\"\r\n\nFurthermore,  the  district  court noted  that  execution  of the\r\n\nJanuary 13, 1994 search warrant \"established, I think powerfully,\r\n\nthe defendant's  presence in the  premises on the first  floor of\r\n\nCardington  Street  and  his ability  and  intention  to exercise\r\n\ncontrol over  items in what  has been variously called  the guest\r\n\nroom or Chucky's room.\" See note 1, supra. Given the plenitude of\r                                                   \r\n\nthese findings, and the fact that crack -- like any other drug of\r\n\na  particular kind --  is an essentially  fungible commodity, the\r\n\npossibility  that at  the time  of  the January  13, 1994  search\r\n\nFortes may  not have  known  \"specifically that  there were  nine\r\n\nindividually  wrapped  jums  on  top  of  the  bureau\"  does  not\r\n\ndestabilize the district court's verdict.  What is dispositive is\r\n\nthe district  court's \"conclusion  that he  [Fortes] knew of  the\r\n\npresence of crack for sale in the premises generally and intended\r\n\nto  possess  that  which  was  present\"  --  a  conclusion  amply\r\n\nsupported by the evidence.2\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2   The district court s  amply supported conclusion also renders\r\ninapposite Fortes   reliance  on our  cautionary observation  and\r\nguidance in  United States v. Booth, 111 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n                               II.\r\n\n          Fortes'  conviction   on  the   felon-in-possession-of-\r\n\nfirearms-and-ammunition count, under 18  U.S.C.   922(g)(1), gave\r\n\nrise  to  a  prison  sentence   on  that  count  of  262  months,\r\n\nsubstantially  in  excess  of the  ten-year  maximum  term which,\r\n\npursuant  to 18 U.S.C.    924(a)(2), ordinarily  sets a cap  on a\r\n\nsentence of incarceration  for a violation of    922(g)(1).  This\r\n\nlengthier   sentence  was   based   on   the   district   court's\r\n\ndetermination that, given Fortes'  criminal history, the ten-year\r\n\nmaximum term was  required to be enhanced by virtue  of the Armed\r\n\nCareer Criminal Act (ACCA), 18  U.S.C.   924(e)(1), and the Act's\r\n\ncompanion  sentencing   guideline,  U.S.S.G.      4B1.4.   Fortes\r\n\nchallenges  that determination,  raising  questions of  law  with\r\n\nrespect to which our review is plenary.\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\ndenied, 118 S. Ct. 204 (1997).   There the jury was charged  that\r                \r\nan inference of  constructive possession was permissible  \"when a\r\nperson knowingly has the  power and the intention at a given time\r\nof exercising  dominion and  control over an  object or  over the\r                                                                           \r\narea in  which the  object is located.\"   Id.  at 2  (emphasis in\r                                                      \r\noriginal).  While  acknowledging that \"knowledge can  be inferred\r\nin some  circumstances from control  of the area,\" we  felt there\r\nwas some  risk of  over-breadth in the  proposition that  knowing\r\ncontrol of  an  area  might, without  more,  properly  ground  an\r\ninference of constructive possession of  whatever might be in the\r\narea.    Accordingly,  without disturbing the  verdict in Booth s\r\ncase  (in which \"the  jury was told  several times that  proof of\r\n knowing   possession was  required; [and]  the evidence  linking\r\nappellant to the gun was substantial,\" id.), we cautioned against\r                                                   \r\nthe utilization of so elastic an  instruction in the future.  But\r\nhere  the  district  court  did  not  ground  its   inference  of\r\npossession   in  the  fact  of  knowing  control  over  the  area\r\nsimpliciter;  the district court found  that Fortes was aware of,\r                     \r\nand intended to participate in  possessing, crack that was on the\r\npremises and that was available for sale.\r\n\n                               -9-\r\r\n\n          Section  924(e)(1) of Title  18 provides for  a minimum\r\n\nterm of  incarceration of fifteen  years without  parole for  any\r\n\nperson \"who violates  section 922(g) of this title  and has three\r\n\nprevious convictions by any court . . . for a violent felony or a\r\n\nserious drug offense, or  both.\"  Although Fortes had, as  of the\r\n\ndate of his  sentencing in this case, a  not unimpressive history\r\n\nof prior criminal convictions, he takes exception to the district\r\n\ncourt's  conclusion that  more  than two  of  them were  \"violent\r\n\nfelon[ies]\" within the meaning of   924(e)(1).\r\n\n          At sentencing,  the district court concluded  that five\r\n\nof Fortes' prior convictions -- two Massachusetts convictions and\r\n\nthree federal  convictions  -- qualified  as  predicate  \"violent\r\n\nfelon[ies].\"   The Massachusetts convictions were for assault and\r\n\nbattery on  a correctional  officer and  assault  with intent  to\r\n\nmurder.  The federal convictions  were for possession of a sawed-\r\n\noff  shotgun, conspiracy to  commit bank robbery,  and armed bank\r\n\nrobbery.\r\n\n          In  appealing  the enhanced  sentence,  Fortes contends\r\n\nthat three of the five  convictions counted by the district court\r\n\nas  predicate offenses were  not \"violent felon[ies]\"  within the\r\n\nmeaning  of  ACCA.    The  three  whose  characterization  Fortes\r\n\nchallenges are the Massachusetts  assault and battery  conviction\r\n\nand the federal possession of a sawed off shotgun and conspiracy-\r\n\nto-commit-bank-robbery convictions.\r\n\n          Subsequent to Fortes' sentencing, this court, in United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Indelicato, 97 F.3d  627 (1st Cir.), cert  denied, 117\r                                                                      \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\nS. Ct. 1013 (1997), had occasion  to consider the status, for the\r\n\npurposes  of  the  federal criminal  code,  of  the Massachusetts\r\n\noffense of assault  and battery -- an offense which Massachusetts\r\n\ndenominates a  \"misdemeanor,\" and  conviction of  which does  not\r\n\nentail a loss  of civil rights.  As  the government acknowledges,\r\n\nour    Indelicato   analysis    precludes   characterizing    the\r                           \r\n\nMassachusetts  offense of  assault  and  battery  as  a  \"violent\r\n\nfelony\" under  ACCA.  The  government insists, however,  that the\r\n\ntwo other  offenses called into question by  Fortes -- possession\r\n\nof a sawed-off  shotgun and conspiracy to commit  bank robbery --\r\n\nare both \"violent  felon[ies].\"  If the government  is correct as\r\n\nto either offense, then that offense, taken together with the two\r\n\noffenses whose \"violent felony\" status Fortes does not dispute --\r\n\narmed bank robbery and assault with intent to murder -- would add\r\n\nup to  the three predicate  offenses which bring ACCA  into play.\r\n\nBut if  Fortes is  right that neither  possession of  a sawed-off\r\n\nshotgun  nor conspiracy  to rob  a  bank is  a \"violent  felony,\"\r\n\nsentencing Fortes as an armed career criminal was not authorized.\r\n\n          We turn, then, to a  consideration of whether either of\r\n\nthese  offenses is properly characterizable as a \"violent felony\"\r\n\nfor the purposes of ACCA.\r\n\nA.  Is  possession  of  a sawed-off  shotgun  a  \"violent felony\"\r                                                                           \r\n\n    within the meaning of ACCA?\r                                         \r\n\n          Possession of a sawed-off shotgun is made an offense by\r\n\nthe confluence of  26 U.S.C.    5861(d) and 26 U.S.C.    5845(a).\r\n\nSection 5861(d) of Title 26 makes  it \"unlawful for any person  .\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\n. . to  receive or possess a  firearm which is  not registered to\r\n\nhim in the National Firearms  Registry and Transfer Record.\"  And\r\n\nsection  5845(a) instructs that the \"term 'firearm' means,\" inter\r                                                                           \r\n\nalia, \"a shotgun having a barrel or barrels of less than eighteen\r              \r\n\ninches in length.\"   26 U.S.C.    5845(a).  As the  Ninth Circuit\r\n\nobserved in United States v. Dunn, 946 F.2d 615, 621 (9th  Cir.),\r                                           \r\n\ncert. denied,  502 U.S. 950  (1991), \"[n]ot all firearms  must be\r                      \r\n\nregistered under 26  U.S.C.   5861(d).  Only  those firearms must\r\n\nbe registered that Congress has found to be inherently  dangerous\r\n\nand generally lacking usefulness, except for violent and criminal\r\n\npurposes,  such  as  sawed-off shotguns  and  hand-grenades.   26\r\n\nU.S.C.   5845.\"  \r\n\n          The  term \"violent  felony,\" as  utilized  in ACCA,  18\r\n\nU.S.C.   924(e)(1), is defined in  18 U.S.C.   924(e)(2)(B).  The\r\n\ndefinition is as follows:\r\n\n            [T]he  term   violent  felony  means   any  crime\r\n    punishable  by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\r\n    . . . that --  \r\n                  (i) has  as an  element the  use,\r\n             attempted  use, or  threatened use  of\r\n             physical force  against the person  of\r\n             another; or \r\n                  (ii)   is  burglary,   arson,  or\r\n             extortion,     involves     use     of\r\n             explosives,   or  otherwise   involves\r\n             conduct   that   presents  a   serious\r\n             potential risk  of physical injury  to\r\n             another.\r\n\n          In considering whether an offense is a \"violent felony\"\r\n\nwithin the meaning  of 18 U.S.C.     924(e)(1) and  924(e)(2)(B),\r\n\ncourts are,  as a  general matter, directed  to pursue  \"a formal\r\n\ncategorical  approach, looking only  to the statutory definitions\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nof the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying\r\n\nthose convictions.\"   Taylor v.

What cannot be\r\n\ndetermined  solely  by  reading the  statutory  texts  is whether\r\n\npossession of a sawed-off shotgun \"involves conduct that presents\r\n\na  serious potential  risk of  physical injury  to another.\"   18\r\n\nU.S.C.   924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  \r\n\n          In arguing that  possession of a sawed-off  shotgun, in\r\n\ncontravention  of 26  U.S.C.    5861(d), is  not an  offense that\r\n\nfalls within the purview of    924(e)(2)(B)(ii), Fortes relies on\r\n\nUnited  States v. Doe, 960  F.2d 221 (1st Cir.  1992).  In Doe we\r                                                                        \r\n\nheld that possession of a firearm by a felon, in contravention of\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    922(g)(1),  was not  a    924(e)(2)(B)(ii) offense.\r\n\nSince possession is  the defining criminal act both  of   5861(d)\r                          \r\n\nand  of   922(g)(1),  Fortes  contends  that  \"Doe  controls  and\r                                                            \r\n\ndictates  the conclusion that [possession of a sawed-off shotgun]\r\n\ndoes not qualify as a 'violent [felony]'.\"  \r\n\n          Our holding in Doe was based on several considerations.\r                                      \r\n\nThe concluding consideration built upon the position taken by the\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\nSentencing  Commission  in  a 1991  amendment  to  the commentary\r\n\ngoverning the career  offender guidelines, U.S.S.G.     4B1.1 and\r\n\n4B1.2, the  close guideline analogues of 18  U.S.C.   924(e).  We\r\n\nsaid this:\r\n\n             Fourth,  the   United  States   Sentencing\r\n          Commission,     following     a     statutory\r\n          instruction, 28 U.S.C.    994(a), has written\r\n          Guidelines   with   enhancements   for  those\r\n          violent offenders with  two prior convictions\r                                               \r\n          for \"crimes of violence.\"   U.S.S.G.   4B1.1.\r\n          In defining  the words  \"crime of  violence,\"\r\n          the  Guidelines  use  the very  language  now\r\n          before  us,  namely the  words  \"conduct that\r\n          presents a serious potential risk of physical\r\n          injury to another.\"  U.S.S.G.   4B1.2(1)(ii).\r\n          The  Commission  has   recently  amended  its\r\n          commentary to make clear that  these words do\r\n          \"not   include   the  offense   of   unlawful\r                                                                 \r\n          possession  of   a  firearm   by  a   felon.\"\r                                                               \r\n          U.S.S.G.    4B1.2,  comment.

The   Commission,  which  collects\r\n          detailed sentencing  data on  virtually every\r\n          federal criminal  case, is  better able  than\r\n          any  individual  court  to make  an  informed\r\n          judgment  about the  relation between  simple\r\n          unlawful gun possession and the likelihood of\r\n          accompanying violence.   For this reason, and\r\n          because  uniform  interpretation  of  similar\r\n          language is  in itself desirable,  we believe\r\n          we should  give  some  legal  weight  to  the\r\n          Commission's determination.\r\n\nDoe, 960 F.2d at 225.\r             \r\n\n          The  Sentencing Commission  has  not issued  a  similar\r\n\namendment concerning possession  of a sawed-off shotgun,  or such\r\n\nother firearms as a silencer or a machine gun whose possession is\r\n\nalso  proscribed   by      5861(d)  (in   combination  with   the\r\n\ndefinitional provision, 26 U.S.C.   5845(a)).   The reasonable --\r\n\nindeed,  very substantial --  difference between possession  of a\r\n\ngeneric  \"firearm\" and  possession  of  one  of  the  specialized\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nweapons  singled-out for particularized treatment by 26 U.S.C.   \r\n\n5845(a)  and  5861(d)  is  illustrated  by  the  Ninth  Circuit's\r\n\ndecision in  United States v.

The  Ninth Circuit's\r\n\nHuffhines analysis merits quotation:  \r                   \r\n\n          The crime of possession of a firearm silencer\r\n          does  not   have  as  an  element   the  use,\r\n          attempted use  or threatened use  of physical\r\n          force required  by section 4B1.2(1)(i).

Charles Brookshire).  A four-count indictment, handed up on December 6, 1995, charged that on January 13, 1994 Fortes (1) was a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition (18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1));  (2) possessed a firearm with an obliterated serial number (18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k));  (3) possessed cocaine with intent to distribute (21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1));  and (4) used and carried firearms during and in connection with the cocaine possession alleged in count 3 (18 U.S.C. &#167;   924(c)(1)).  Prior to trial the fourth count was dropped.  In May of 1996, having waived a jury trial, Fortes was tried to the bench on counts 1, 2 and 3. After a week's trial Fortes was found guilty on all three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortes was sentenced in July of 1996.  Finding that under count 1--felon in possession of firearms and ammunition--Fortes was subject to enhanced penalties pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), and the armed career criminal sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4, the district court sentenced Fortes to a prison term of 262 months on count 1. The district court also imposed concurrent sentences of 60 months on count 2 and 262 months on count 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Fortes challenges several aspects of his conviction and sentence.  Two of the issues he raises merit discussion.  To these we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortes argues that findings made by the district court in connection with the conviction under count 3--possession of cocaine with intent to distribute--are incompatible with a verdict of guilty.  Fortes' precise contention is that certain of the district court's findings are directly at odds with a conclusion that, within the intendment of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), he \"knowingly\" possessed the particular units of cocaine that he was charged with possessing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cocaine in question consisted of nine \"jums\"--wrapped packages of crack.  Law enforcement officers executing a search warrant on January 13, 1994, at Fortes' aunt's apartment at 5 Cardington Street in the Roxbury section of Boston, found the jums on a bureau located in a guest room frequented by Fortes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The search marked the culmination of several months of law enforcement efforts inquiring into drug-and-firearms-related activities of Fortes and others at the Roxbury apartment.  These law enforcement efforts included two controlled drug transactions in which cocaine was sold at the Roxbury apartment to a confidential informant:  in the first transaction, in September of 1993, Fortes was the seller;  in the second transaction, in early January of 1994, a Fortes confederate was the seller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court made extended findings with respect to the three counts of conviction--felon in possession of firearms and ammunition;  possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number;  and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  In order fairly to assess Fortes' challenge to his conviction on the cocaine-possession count it will be helpful to quote the entirety of the district court's findings on that count.  To place those findings in proper context, the concluding portions of the district court's preceding discussion--the discussion of the two firearms counts--will also be set forth:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So with respect to Count 1, I find that the defendant did have constructive possession of the items alleged in Count 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, let me just say that possession may well have been joint.  I'm not called upon to decide fully whether it was joint.  It's sufficient that the defendant has possession.  The evidence does indicate that it was joint with others, perhaps, because other people came and went at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And, of course, question of ownership is not at issue.  Possession is to be determined apart from ownership, some preference as to whose guns they were and that is, I think, legally beside the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Count 2, Count 2 relates to the weapon with the obliterated serial number.  That was the Interdynamic semiautomatic pistol.  It was found in the right-hand bedroom and is one of the items that I conclude the defendant constructively possessed knowingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I reach essentially similar conclusion [sic ] with respect to Count 3 which alleges the defendant possessed a controlled substance knowingly with the intent to distribute it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First of all, I think it's clear that it's a controlled substance.  I've read the report of one of the items.  I don't know if it matters the other [sic ] weren't analyzed, whether the one is cocaine base, I don't think it matters the others are not.  I don't think it matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the same principles of possession, I would conclude from defendant's participation in a drug sale in September that he knew that was a drug-selling place and that he intended to participate in it, intended to possess the drugs that were available for sale within the premises from time to time;  and that as a willing, knowing participant in that conspiracy to sell drugs as well as firearms, the defendant knew that drugs, particularly cocaine base, would be available and would be sold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And I find further that he had the intention to exercise control over--perhaps jointly with others--over such drugs as were in the apartment for sale at any given time through the date of the indictment, date alleged in the indictment.  I'm sorry, through the date alleged in the Count 3 in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I may say that I do not find that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew of these specific nine items being on top of the bureau at the particular time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There's not evidence that the defendant was there in such a time--in proximity to the search that he knew specifically that there were nine individually wrapped jums on top of the bureau.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't think that is necessary because of my conclusion that he knew of the presence of crack for sale in the premises generally and intended to possess that which was present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But to the extent that may make any difference legally, I mention that;  and I'm not convinced that he knew of those specific items.  And I distinguish those from the firearms, for example, because I think much more likelihood, likely that that was a transitory condition, that nine individually wrapped jum doses would not remain very long on the top of a bureau whereas I think firearms stored in safes and behind--in briefcases behind cabinets, so on, so forth, were there for longer term storage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it's not clear who in the events of the day may have deposited those individual packages and for how long they were there.  I could not find the defendant knew of those specifically, but I don't think that's necessary to the proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think that it's sufficient for the government to have proved participation in the conspiracy which was the sale of cocaine, cocaine base, knowing that there would be a supply and that intended to participate in that by possessing and exercising control over the supply as it may been from time to time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find further that possession by the defendant was with the intent to distribute.  I find from all the evidence that sales was [sic ] going on, including his own participation in the sale and in addition from the evidence the defendant himself did not use cocaine or cocaine base so that the element--I find the government has proved possession with intention to distribute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortes argues that the key to the district court's finding that he knowingly possessed cocaine was \"that as a willing, knowing participant in that conspiracy to sell drugs as well as firearms, the defendant knew that drugs, particularly cocaine base, would be available and would be sold.\"   Fortes goes on to point out that he was not charged with participation in a conspiracy.  In arguing that the district court's characterization of him as a conspirator undercuts the district court's verdict on the possession count, Fortes invokes language of this court in United States v. Zavala Maldonado, 23 F.3d 4 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 975, 115 S.Ct. 451, 130 L.Ed.2d 360 (1994).  Defendant Zavala--like Fortes in the case at bar--was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  And in Zavala's case, we pointed out that, \"given that these offenses [conspiracy, and aiding and abetting an attempt] were not charged, it is hardly sufficient to say that this record contained evidence to support such a conviction,\" and we there went on to state that \"the conviction for possession can stand only if a reasonable jury could find that Zavala did possess the cocaine within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841.\"  Id. at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that here, as in Zavala Maldonado, no conspiracy charge was laid against the defendant.  Thus here, as there, a charge of possession could not be proved by demonstrating vicarious accountability--i.e., possession by a co-conspirator is not possession by the defendant where the defendant has not been charged with conspiracy.  But--as in Zavala Maldonado, so here--proof of the defendant's possession rested on the defendant's own conduct, not on that of co-conspirators.  To be sure, in the case at bar the district court referred to Fortes' participation in a \"conspiracy to sell drugs as well as firearms,\" but the district court also referred to \"defendant's participation in a drug sale in September [of 1993],\" a datum from which the district court inferred that Fortes \"knew that was a drug-selling place and that he intended to participate in it, intended to possess the drugs that were available for sale within the premises from time to time.\"   Furthermore, the district court noted that execution of the January 13, 1994 search warrant \"established, I think powerfully, the defendant's presence in the premises on the first floor of Cardington Street and his ability and intention to exercise control over items in what has been variously called the guest room or Chucky's room.\"   See note 1, supra.   Given the plenitude of these findings, and the fact that crack--like any other drug of a particular kind--is an essentially fungible commodity, the possibility that at the time of the January 13, 1994 search Fortes may not have known \"specifically that there were nine individually wrapped jums on top of the bureau\" does not destabilize the district court's verdict.  What is dispositive is the district court's \"conclusion that he [Fortes] knew of the presence of crack for sale in the premises generally and intended to possess that which was present\"--a conclusion amply supported by the evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortes' conviction on the felon-in-possession-of-firearms-and-ammunition count, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), gave rise to a prison sentence on that count of 262 months, substantially in excess of the ten-year maximum term which, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2), ordinarily sets a cap on a sentence of incarceration for a violation of &#167; 922(g)(1).  This lengthier sentence was based on the district court's determination that, given Fortes' criminal history, the ten-year maximum term was required to be enhanced by virtue of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), and the Act's companion sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4.  Fortes challenges that determination, raising questions of law with respect to which our review is plenary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 924(e)(1) of Title 18 provides for a minimum term of incarceration of fifteen years without parole for any person \"who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both.\"   Although Fortes had, as of the date of his sentencing in this case, a not unimpressive history of prior criminal convictions, he takes exception to the district court's conclusion that more than two of them were \"violent felon[ies]\" within the meaning of &#167; 924(e)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court concluded that five of Fortes' prior convictions--two Massachusetts convictions and three federal convictions--qualified as predicate \"violent felon[ies].\"  The Massachusetts convictions were for assault and battery on a correctional officer and assault with intent to murder.  The federal convictions were for possession of a sawed-off shotgun, conspiracy to commit bank robbery, and armed bank robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In appealing the enhanced sentence, Fortes contends that three of the five convictions counted by the district court as predicate offenses were not \"violent felon[ies]\" within the meaning of ACCA.  The three whose characterization Fortes challenges are the Massachusetts assault and battery conviction and the federal possession of a sawed off shotgun and conspiracy-to-commit-bank-robbery convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to Fortes' sentencing, this court, in United States v. Indelicato, 97 F.3d 627 (1st Cir.), cert denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1013, 136 L.Ed.2d 890 (1997), had occasion to consider the status, for the purposes of the federal criminal code, of the Massachusetts offense of assault and battery--an offense which Massachusetts denominates a \"misdemeanor,\" and conviction of which does not entail a loss of civil rights.  As the government acknowledges, our Indelicato analysis precludes characterizing the Massachusetts offense of assault and battery as a \"violent felony\" under ACCA.  The government insists, however, that the two other offenses called into question by Fortes--possession of a sawed-off shotgun and conspiracy to commit bank robbery--are both \"violent felon[ies].\"  If the government is correct as to either offense, then that offense, taken together with the two offenses whose \"violent felony\" status Fortes does not dispute--armed bank robbery and assault with intent to murder--would add up to the three predicate offenses which bring ACCA into play.  But if Fortes is right that neither possession of a sawed-off shotgun nor conspiracy to rob a bank is a \"violent felony,\" sentencing Fortes as an armed career criminal was not authorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to a consideration of whether either of these offenses is properly characterizable as a \"violent felony\" for the purposes of ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>A.

Section 5861(d) of Title 26 makes it \"unlawful for any person ... to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registry and Transfer Record.\"   And section 5845(a) instructs that the \"term 'firearm' means,\" inter alia, \"a shotgun having a barrel or barrels of less than eighteen inches in length.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a).  As the Ninth Circuit observed in United States v. Dunn, 946 F.2d 615, 621 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 950, 112 S.Ct. 401, 116 L.Ed.2d 350 (1991), \"[n]ot all firearms must be registered under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d).  Only those firearms must be registered that Congress has found to be inherently dangerous and generally lacking usefulness, except for violent and criminal purposes, such as sawed-off shotguns and hand-grenades.  26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845.\"The term \"violent felony,\" as utilized in ACCA, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), is defined in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B).  The definition is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he term violent felony means any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that--</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another;  or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering whether an offense is a \"violent felony\" within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 924(e)(1) and 924(e)(2)(B), courts are, as a general matter, directed to pursue \"a formal categorical approach, looking only to the statutory definitions of the prior offenses, and not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.\"  Taylor v.

What cannot be determined solely by reading the statutory texts is whether possession of a sawed-off shotgun \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that possession of a sawed-off shotgun, in contravention of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d), is not an offense that falls within the purview of &#167; 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), Fortes relies on United States v. Doe, 960 F.2d 221 (1st Cir.1992).  In Doe we held that possession of a firearm by a felon, in contravention of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), was not a &#167; 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) offense.  Since possession is the defining criminal act both of &#167; 5861(d) and of &#167; 922(g)(1), Fortes contends that \"Doe controls and dictates the conclusion that [possession of a sawed-off shotgun] does not qualify as a 'violent [felony]'.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding in Doe was based on several considerations.  The concluding consideration built upon the position taken by the Sentencing Commission in a 1991 amendment to the commentary governing the career offender guidelines, U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 4B1.1 and 4B1.2, the close guideline analogues of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).  We said this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the United States Sentencing Commission, following a statutory instruction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(a), has written Guidelines with enhancements for those violent offenders with two prior convictions for \"crimes of violence.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1.  In defining the words \"crime of violence,\" the Guidelines use the very language now before us, namely the words \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1)(ii).  The Commission has recently amended its commentary to make clear that these words do \"not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2, comment.  (n.2)(emphasis added).  The Commission, which collects detailed sentencing data on virtually every federal criminal case, is better able than any individual court to make an informed judgment about the relation between simple unlawful gun possession and the likelihood of accompanying violence.  For this reason, and because uniform interpretation of similar language is in itself desirable, we believe we should give some legal weight to the Commission's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doe, 960 F.2d at 225.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission has not issued a similar amendment concerning possession of a sawed-off shotgun, or such other firearms as a silencer or a machine gun whose possession is also proscribed by &#167; 5861(d) (in combination with the definitional provision, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a)).  The reasonable--indeed, very substantial--difference between possession of a generic \"firearm\" and possession of one of the specialized weapons singled-out for particularized treatment by 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5845(a) and 5861(d) is illustrated by the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Huffhines, 967 F.2d 314 (9th Cir.1992).  There the court held that a 1989 Sentencing Commission amendment to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2 (an amendment adopted two years prior to the Sentencing Commission's commentary amendment discussed by this court in Doe ) precluded characterizing felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm as a \"crime of violence\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 4B1.1 and 4B1.2.  See United States v. Sahakian, 965 F.2d 740 (9th Cir.1992);  cf.  United States v. O'Neal, 937 F.2d 1369 (9th Cir.1990).  But the Huffhines court, reaffirming the explication of &#167;&#167; 5845(a) and 5861(d) announced in United States v. Dunn, supra (possession of an unregistered firearm--in that instance, a sawed-off shotgun--is a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1), also held that possession of a silencer is a \"crime of violence\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 4B1.1 and 4B1.2.  The Ninth Circuit's Huffhines analysis merits quotation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>The crime of possession of a firearm silencer does not have as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force required by section 4B1.2(1)(i).  See Tex.  Penal Code Ann. &#167; 46.06(a)(4) (West 1989 &amp; Supp.1992).  Thus, in order for the offense to be a crime of violence, it must \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unlawful possession of a silencer presents such a risk.  In United States v. Dunn, 946 F.2d 615, 620-21 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 950, 112 S.Ct. 401, 116 L.Ed.2d 350 (1991), we held that possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d) constituted a crime of violence for purposes of section 4B1.1.  We noted that, under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d), not all firearms must be registered, only those that Congress found to be inherently dangerous and lacking in lawful purposes, such as sawed-off shotguns and grenades.  We reasoned that the possession of an unregistered firearm of the kind defined in section 5845 involved a blatant disregard of the law and a substantial risk of improper physical force.

A silencer is specifically listed in section 5845's definition of \"firearm.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a)(7).  Like a sawed-off shotgun and other firearms of the kind enumerated in that section, a silencer is practically of no use except for a criminal purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huffhines, 967 F.2d at 320-321.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A year after Huffhines, the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed the Huffhines and Dunn analysis of the guidelines term \"crime of violence\" in United States v.

There the jury was charged that an inference of constructive possession was permissible \"when a person knowingly has the power and the intention at a given time of exercising dominion and control over an object or over the area in which the object is located.\"  Id. at 2 (emphasis in original).  While acknowledging that \"knowledge can be inferred in some circumstances from control of the area,\" we felt there was some risk of over-breadth in the proposition that knowing control of an area might, without more, properly ground an inference of constructive possession of whatever might be in the area.  Accordingly, without disturbing the verdict in Booth's case (in which \"the jury was told several times that proof of 'knowing' possession was required;  [and] the evidence linking appellant to the gun was substantial,\" id.), we cautioned against the utilization of so elastic an instruction in the future.  But here the district court did not ground its inference of possession in the fact of knowing control over the area simpliciter;  the district court found that Fortes was aware of, and intended to participate in possessing, crack that was on the premises and that was available for sale</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Hayes court said (7 F.3d at 145):</p>\n        <p>A defendant qualifies as a career offender if he is convicted of a felony that is a crime of violence and has two previous felony convictions for crimes of violence.

Charles Brookshire).  A four-count indictment, handed up on December 6, 1995, charged that on January 13, 1994 Fortes (1) was a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition (18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1));  (2) possessed a firearm with an obliterated serial number (18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(k));  (3) possessed cocaine with intent to distribute (21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1));  and (4) used and carried firearms during and in connection with the cocaine possession alleged in count 3 (18 U.S.C. &#167;   924(c)(1)).  Prior to trial the fourth count was dropped.  In May of 1996, having waived a jury trial, Fortes was tried to the bench on counts 1, 2 and 3. After a week's trial Fortes was found guilty on all three counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortes was sentenced in July of 1996.  Finding that under count 1--felon in possession of firearms and ammunition--Fortes was subject to enhanced penalties pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), and the armed career criminal sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4, the district court sentenced Fortes to a prison term of 262 months on count 1. The district court also imposed concurrent sentences of 60 months on count 2 and 262 months on count 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal Fortes challenges several aspects of his conviction and sentence.  Two of the issues he raises merit discussion.  To these we now turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortes argues that findings made by the district court in connection with the conviction under count 3--possession of cocaine with intent to distribute--are incompatible with a verdict of guilty.  Fortes' precise contention is that certain of the district court's findings are directly at odds with a conclusion that, within the intendment of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), he \"knowingly\" possessed the particular units of cocaine that he was charged with possessing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cocaine in question consisted of nine \"jums\"--wrapped packages of crack.  Law enforcement officers executing a search warrant on January 13, 1994, at Fortes' aunt's apartment at 5 Cardington Street in the Roxbury section of Boston, found the jums on a bureau located in a guest room frequented by Fortes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The search marked the culmination of several months of law enforcement efforts inquiring into drug-and-firearms-related activities of Fortes and others at the Roxbury apartment.  These law enforcement efforts included two controlled drug transactions in which cocaine was sold at the Roxbury apartment to a confidential informant:  in the first transaction, in September of 1993, Fortes was the seller;  in the second transaction, in early January of 1994, a Fortes confederate was the seller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court made extended findings with respect to the three counts of conviction--felon in possession of firearms and ammunition;  possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number;  and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  In order fairly to assess Fortes' challenge to his conviction on the cocaine-possession count it will be helpful to quote the entirety of the district court's findings on that count.  To place those findings in proper context, the concluding portions of the district court's preceding discussion--the discussion of the two firearms counts--will also be set forth:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So with respect to Count 1, I find that the defendant did have constructive possession of the items alleged in Count 1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, let me just say that possession may well have been joint.  I'm not called upon to decide fully whether it was joint.  It's sufficient that the defendant has possession.  The evidence does indicate that it was joint with others, perhaps, because other people came and went at the same time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And, of course, question of ownership is not at issue.  Possession is to be determined apart from ownership, some preference as to whose guns they were and that is, I think, legally beside the point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Count 2, Count 2 relates to the weapon with the obliterated serial number.  That was the Interdynamic semiautomatic pistol.  It was found in the right-hand bedroom and is one of the items that I conclude the defendant constructively possessed knowingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I reach essentially similar conclusion [sic ] with respect to Count 3 which alleges the defendant possessed a controlled substance knowingly with the intent to distribute it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First of all, I think it's clear that it's a controlled substance.  I've read the report of one of the items.  I don't know if it matters the other [sic ] weren't analyzed, whether the one is cocaine base, I don't think it matters the others are not.  I don't think it matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying the same principles of possession, I would conclude from defendant's participation in a drug sale in September that he knew that was a drug-selling place and that he intended to participate in it, intended to possess the drugs that were available for sale within the premises from time to time;  and that as a willing, knowing participant in that conspiracy to sell drugs as well as firearms, the defendant knew that drugs, particularly cocaine base, would be available and would be sold.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">And I find further that he had the intention to exercise control over--perhaps jointly with others--over such drugs as were in the apartment for sale at any given time through the date of the indictment, date alleged in the indictment.  I'm sorry, through the date alleged in the Count 3 in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I may say that I do not find that the government has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew of these specific nine items being on top of the bureau at the particular time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There's not evidence that the defendant was there in such a time--in proximity to the search that he knew specifically that there were nine individually wrapped jums on top of the bureau.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I don't think that is necessary because of my conclusion that he knew of the presence of crack for sale in the premises generally and intended to possess that which was present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But to the extent that may make any difference legally, I mention that;  and I'm not convinced that he knew of those specific items.  And I distinguish those from the firearms, for example, because I think much more likelihood, likely that that was a transitory condition, that nine individually wrapped jum doses would not remain very long on the top of a bureau whereas I think firearms stored in safes and behind--in briefcases behind cabinets, so on, so forth, were there for longer term storage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But it's not clear who in the events of the day may have deposited those individual packages and for how long they were there.  I could not find the defendant knew of those specifically, but I don't think that's necessary to the proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I think that it's sufficient for the government to have proved participation in the conspiracy which was the sale of cocaine, cocaine base, knowing that there would be a supply and that intended to participate in that by possessing and exercising control over the supply as it may been from time to time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find further that possession by the defendant was with the intent to distribute.  I find from all the evidence that sales was [sic ] going on, including his own participation in the sale and in addition from the evidence the defendant himself did not use cocaine or cocaine base so that the element--I find the government has proved possession with intention to distribute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortes argues that the key to the district court's finding that he knowingly possessed cocaine was \"that as a willing, knowing participant in that conspiracy to sell drugs as well as firearms, the defendant knew that drugs, particularly cocaine base, would be available and would be sold.\"   Fortes goes on to point out that he was not charged with participation in a conspiracy.  In arguing that the district court's characterization of him as a conspirator undercuts the district court's verdict on the possession count, Fortes invokes language of this court in United States v. Zavala Maldonado, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"669099\"><a href=\"/opinion/669099/united-states-v-rafael-angel-zavala-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span> (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">360</span></span> (1994).  Defendant Zavala--like Fortes in the case at bar--was charged with possession of cocaine with intent to distribute.  And in Zavala's case, we pointed out that, \"given that these offenses [conspiracy, and aiding and abetting an attempt] were not charged, it is hardly sufficient to say that this record contained evidence to support such a conviction,\" and we there went on to state that \"the conviction for possession can stand only if a reasonable jury could find that Zavala did possess the cocaine within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841.\"  Id. at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that here, as in Zavala Maldonado, no conspiracy charge was laid against the defendant.  Thus here, as there, a charge of possession could not be proved by demonstrating vicarious accountability--i.e., possession by a co-conspirator is not possession by the defendant where the defendant has not been charged with conspiracy.  But--as in Zavala Maldonado, so here--proof of the defendant's possession rested on the defendant's own conduct, not on that of co-conspirators.  To be sure, in the case at bar the district court referred to Fortes' participation in a \"conspiracy to sell drugs as well as firearms,\" but the district court also referred to \"defendant's participation in a drug sale in September [of 1993],\" a datum from which the district court inferred that Fortes \"knew that was a drug-selling place and that he intended to participate in it, intended to possess the drugs that were available for sale within the premises from time to time.\"   Furthermore, the district court noted that execution of the January 13, 1994 search warrant \"established, I think powerfully, the defendant's presence in the premises on the first floor of Cardington Street and his ability and intention to exercise control over items in what has been variously called the guest room or Chucky's room.\"   See note 1, supra.   Given the plenitude of these findings, and the fact that crack--like any other drug of a particular kind--is an essentially fungible commodity, the possibility that at the time of the January 13, 1994 search Fortes may not have known \"specifically that there were nine individually wrapped jums on top of the bureau\" does not destabilize the district court's verdict.  What is dispositive is the district court's \"conclusion that he [Fortes] knew of the presence of crack for sale in the premises generally and intended to possess that which was present\"--a conclusion amply supported by the evidence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fortes' conviction on the felon-in-possession-of-firearms-and-ammunition count, under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), gave rise to a prison sentence on that count of 262 months, substantially in excess of the ten-year maximum term which, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2), ordinarily sets a cap on a sentence of incarceration for a violation of &#167; 922(g)(1).  This lengthier sentence was based on the district court's determination that, given Fortes' criminal history, the ten-year maximum term was required to be enhanced by virtue of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(1), and the Act's companion sentencing guideline, U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4.  Fortes challenges that determination, raising questions of law with respect to which our review is plenary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 924(e)(1) of Title 18 provides for a minimum term of incarceration of fifteen years without parole for any person \"who violates section 922(g) of this title and has three previous convictions by any court ... for a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both.\"   Although Fortes had, as of the date of his sentencing in this case, a not unimpressive history of prior criminal convictions, he takes exception to the district court's conclusion that more than two of them were \"violent felon[ies]\" within the meaning of &#167; 924(e)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At sentencing, the district court concluded that five of Fortes' prior convictions--two Massachusetts convictions and three federal convictions--qualified as predicate \"violent felon[ies].\"  The Massachusetts convictions were for assault and battery on a correctional officer and assault with intent to murder.  The federal convictions were for possession of a sawed-off shotgun, conspiracy to commit bank robbery, and armed bank robbery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In appealing the enhanced sentence, Fortes contends that three of the five convictions counted by the district court as predicate offenses were not \"violent felon[ies]\" within the meaning of ACCA.  The three whose characterization Fortes challenges are the Massachusetts assault and battery conviction and the federal possession of a sawed off shotgun and conspiracy-to-commit-bank-robbery convictions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Subsequent to Fortes' sentencing, this court, in United States v. Indelicato, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197022\"><a href=\"/opinion/197022/united-states-v-indelicato/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">627</span></a></span> (1st Cir.), cert denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">890</span></span> (1997), had occasion to consider the status, for the purposes of the federal criminal code, of the Massachusetts offense of assault and battery--an offense which Massachusetts denominates a \"misdemeanor,\" and conviction of which does not entail a loss of civil rights.  As the government acknowledges, our Indelicato analysis precludes characterizing the Massachusetts offense of assault and battery as a \"violent felony\" under ACCA.  The government insists, however, that the two other offenses called into question by Fortes--possession of a sawed-off shotgun and conspiracy to commit bank robbery--are both \"violent felon[ies].\"  If the government is correct as to either offense, then that offense, taken together with the two offenses whose \"violent felony\" status Fortes does not dispute--armed bank robbery and assault with intent to murder--would add up to the three predicate offenses which bring ACCA into play.  But if Fortes is right that neither possession of a sawed-off shotgun nor conspiracy to rob a bank is a \"violent felony,\" sentencing Fortes as an armed career criminal was not authorized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn, then, to a consideration of whether either of these offenses is properly characterizable as a \"violent felony\" for the purposes of ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p>A.

Section 5861(d) of Title 26 makes it \"unlawful for any person ... to receive or possess a firearm which is not registered to him in the National Firearms Registry and Transfer Record.\"   And section 5845(a) instructs that the \"term 'firearm' means,\" inter alia, \"a shotgun having a barrel or barrels of less than eighteen inches in length.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a).

What cannot be determined solely by reading the statutory texts is whether possession of a sawed-off shotgun \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing that possession of a sawed-off shotgun, in contravention of 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d), is not an offense that falls within the purview of &#167; 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), Fortes relies on United States v.

Since possession is the defining criminal act both of &#167; 5861(d) and of &#167; 922(g)(1), Fortes contends that \"Doe controls and dictates the conclusion that [possession of a sawed-off shotgun] does not qualify as a 'violent [felony]'.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our holding in Doe was based on several considerations.

We said this:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the United States Sentencing Commission, following a statutory instruction, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 994(a), has written Guidelines with enhancements for those violent offenders with two prior convictions for \"crimes of violence.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1.  In defining the words \"crime of violence,\" the Guidelines use the very language now before us, namely the words \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1)(ii).  The Commission has recently amended its commentary to make clear that these words do \"not include the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2, comment.  (n.2)(emphasis added).  The Commission, which collects detailed sentencing data on virtually every federal criminal case, is better able than any individual court to make an informed judgment about the relation between simple unlawful gun possession and the likelihood of accompanying violence.  For this reason, and because uniform interpretation of similar language is in itself desirable, we believe we should give some legal weight to the Commission's determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Doe, 960 F.2d at 225.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission has not issued a similar amendment concerning possession of a sawed-off shotgun, or such other firearms as a silencer or a machine gun whose possession is also proscribed by &#167; 5861(d) (in combination with the definitional provision, 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a)).  The reasonable--indeed, very substantial--difference between possession of a generic \"firearm\" and possession of one of the specialized weapons singled-out for particularized treatment by 26 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 5845(a) and 5861(d) is illustrated by the Ninth Circuit's decision in United States v. Huffhines, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585270\"><a href=\"/opinion/585270/united-states-v-richard-samuel-huffhines/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1992).  There the court held that a 1989 Sentencing Commission amendment to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2 (an amendment adopted two years prior to the Sentencing Commission's commentary amendment discussed by this court in Doe ) precluded characterizing felon-in-possession-of-a-firearm as a \"crime of violence\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 4B1.1 and 4B1.2.  See United States v. Sahakian, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584028\"><a href=\"/opinion/584028/united-states-v-david-sahakian/\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span> (9th Cir.1992);  cf.

But the Huffhines court, reaffirming the explication of &#167;&#167; 5845(a) and 5861(d) announced in United States v. Dunn, supra (possession of an unregistered firearm--in that instance, a sawed-off shotgun--is a \"crime of violence\" for purposes of U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1), also held that possession of a silencer is a \"crime of violence\" within the meaning of U.S.S.G. &#167;&#167; 4B1.1 and 4B1.2.  The Ninth Circuit's Huffhines analysis merits quotation:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p>The crime of possession of a firearm silencer does not have as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force required by section 4B1.2(1)(i).  See Tex.  Penal Code Ann. &#167; 46.06(a)(4) (West 1989 &amp; Supp.1992).  Thus, in order for the offense to be a crime of violence, it must \"involve[ ] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(1)(ii).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unlawful possession of a silencer presents such a risk.

We noted that, under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 5861(d), not all firearms must be registered, only those that Congress found to be inherently dangerous and lacking in lawful purposes, such as sawed-off shotguns and grenades.  We reasoned that the possession of an unregistered firearm of the kind defined in section 5845 involved a blatant disregard of the law and a substantial risk of improper physical force.  Id. at 621.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning also applies to the unlawful possession of a silencer.  A silencer is specifically listed in section 5845's definition of \"firearm.\"  26 U.S.C. &#167; 5845(a)(7).  Like a sawed-off shotgun and other firearms of the kind enumerated in that section, a silencer is practically of no use except for a criminal purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Huffhines, 967 F.2d at 320-321.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A year after Huffhines, the Ninth Circuit reaffirmed the Huffhines and Dunn analysis of the guidelines term \"crime of violence\" in United States v.

We do so again today.  We hold that possession of a sawed-off shotgun is a \"violent felony\" within the meaning of ACCA.B.

They weren't simply historical papers, but they were current operational papers.</p>\n        <p>Among the papers were his current--I think the most recent one was in December, report to his probation officer which included copies of his paychecks earned through the month of December and, I think, in fact, into January, indicating that even in January 1994, defendant had a present and ongoing connection with that room by treating it as a repository for papers that were of some importance to him.</p>\n        <p>I may note that the defendant in his probation reports or reports to the probation supervising probation officer reported that his residence was 5 Cardington Street.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court's amply supported conclusion also renders inapposite Fortes' reliance on our cautionary observation and guidance in United States v.

There the jury was charged that an inference of constructive possession was permissible \"when a person knowingly has the power and the intention at a given time of exercising dominion and control over an object or over the area in which the object is located.\"  Id. at 2 (emphasis in original).  While acknowledging that \"knowledge can be inferred in some circumstances from control of the area,\" we felt there was some risk of over-breadth in the proposition that knowing control of an area might, without more, properly ground an inference of constructive possession of whatever might be in the area.  Accordingly, without disturbing the verdict in Booth's case (in which \"the jury was told several times that proof of 'knowing' possession was required;  [and] the evidence linking appellant to the gun was substantial,\" id.), we cautioned against the utilization of so elastic an instruction in the future.  But here the district court did not ground its inference of possession in the fact of knowing control over the area simpliciter;  the district court found that Fortes was aware of, and intended to participate in possessing, crack that was on the premises and that was available for sale</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The Hayes court said (7 F.3d at 145):</p>\n        <p>A defendant qualifies as a career offender if he is convicted of a felony that is a crime of violence and has two previous felony convictions for crimes of violence.

Section 4B1.2(1) defines a crime of violence as a felony offense under federal or state law that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or ... involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"   Because the statutory definition of Hayes' unregistered shotgun conviction does not involve the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another, we focus solely on whether the charged conduct presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
