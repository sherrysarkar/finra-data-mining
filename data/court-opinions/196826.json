Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\r                                                                    \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                            Before\r\n\n                    Selya, Cyr and Boudin,\r\n                       Circuit Judges.\r                                                 \r\n\n                                         \r\n\nRafael A. Oliveras Lopez De Victoria on brief for appellant.\r                                                \r\nGuillermo Gil, United  States Attorney, and Fidel A. Sevillano Del\r                                                                              \r\nRio, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r           \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\r\n\n          Per Curiam.  After careful review of the briefs and\r                                \r\n\nthe record, we conclude that there is no substantial question\r\n\npresented  in this  appeal  and that  summary disposition  is\r\n\nappropriate.   The  district court correctly  determined that\r\n\nplaintiff's  claim  was  time-barred,  and we  add  only  the\r\n\nfollowing comments.\r\n\n     Although plaintiff's 1990 claim  may have been timely as\r\n\nto those few incidents occurring in 1989  and 1990, plaintiff\r\n\ndid  not identify any of  those more recent  incidents as the\r\n\ncause of significant  harm.  Accordingly,  in the context  of\r\n\nthis appeal,  we  do not  consider  them to  be  individually\r\n\nactionable torts  that should survive the government's motion\r\n\nto dismiss.  \r\n\n     In  any case, plaintiff does not appear to state a claim\r\n\nbased  on  any  individual  incidents; instead,  as  we  read\r\n\nplaintiff's complaint and other filings, his underlying claim\r\n\nis one  of  institutional discrimination  manifesting  itself\r\n\nfrom  time to time since  1953 in various  actions by various\r\n\nVeterans  Administration personnel.   Such  a claim  might be\r\n\ntimely under  the  Federal  Tort  Claims  Act,  28  U.S.C.   \r\n\n2401(b),  if the  claim alleged  a \"continuing  tort\" and  at\r\n\nleast  one  tortious  action  occurred within  the  statutory\r\n\nlimitations  period.    See,  e.g., Havens  Realty  Corp.  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nColeman, 455  U.S. 363, 380-81 (1982);  Johnson v.

Plaintiff's own unsupported speculation  and\r\n\nimprobable  inference  about  the  VA's \"plan\"  to  deny  him\r\n\ntreatment and  benefits was  not sufficient to  withstand the\r\n\ngovernment's motion for summary judgment.   See Mack v. Great\r                                                                         \r\n\nAtlantic  &amp; Pacific Tea Co.,  871 F.2d 179,  182-83 (1st Cir.\r                                       \r\n\n1989)  (mere   vague  references   concerning  a   policy  of\r\n\ndiscrimination  are  not  sufficient);  Medina-Munoz  v. R.J.\r                                                                         \r\n\nReynolds  Tobacco  Co.,  896  F.2d  5,  8  (1st   Cir.  1990)\r                                  \r\n\n(similar).  Therefore, plaintiff's complaint based on all the\r\n\nevents  stretching back over  more than  forty years  was not\r\n\ntimely filed, and the district court properly granted summary\r\n\njudgment for the government.\r\n\n     Affirmed.
