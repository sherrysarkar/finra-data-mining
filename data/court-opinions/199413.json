The government has moved for summary\n\ndisposition in this direct criminal appeal filed by David\n\nBrent Costigan.   We grant the motion and summarily affirm\n\nCostigan's conviction and sentence.\n\n         Costigan was convicted, after a bench trial, of\n\npossession of a firearm after having been convicted of a\n\nmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence, involving his former\n\ngirlfriend, Maria Santos.     See 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(9).1   A\n\nmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence is defined as\n\n         an offense that -\n\n         (i) is a misdemeanor under Federal or\n         State law; and\n\n\n\n\n  1Section 922(g)(9) provides that:\n\n       It shall be unlawful for any person -\n\n                             . . .\n\n            who has been convicted in any court of\n       a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\n\n                             . . .\n\n       to ship or transport in interstate or\n       foreign commerce, or possess in or affecting\n       commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or to\n       receive any firearm or ammunition which has\n       been shipped or transported in interstate or\n       foreign commerce.\n\n                              -2-\n\f            (ii) has, as an element, the use or\n            attempted use of physical force, or the\n            threatened use of a deadly weapon,\n            committed by a current or former spouse,\n            parent, or guardian of the victim, by a\n            person with whom the victim shares a\n            child in common, by a person who is\n            cohabiting with or has cohabited with\n            the victim as a spouse, parent, or\n            guardian, or by a      person similarly\n            situated   to  a   spouse,  parent,   or\n            guardian of the victim.\n\n 18 U.S.C. § 921(a)(33)(A) (emphasis added).           Costigan was\n\n sentenced on October 17, 2000 to four months imprisonment\n\n and remanded to custody at that time.2\n\n            At trial, Costigan stipulated that he had possessed\n\n a rifle, which had traveled in interstate commerce, and that\n\n he had two prior convictions for assaulting Santos, which\n\n convictions were misdemeanors under Maine law and had, as an\n\n element,   the   use   or   attempted   use   of   physical   force.\n\n Costigan   contested    only   that   the   convictions   were   for\n\n domestic violence as required by § 922(g)(9) and defined by\n\n § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii).        The issue at trial and Costigan's\n\n primary issue on appeal is his contention that \"cohabiting\n\n ... with the victim as a spouse,\" see § 921(a)(33)(A)(ii)\n\n [quoted, supra], is unconstitutionally vague.\n\n\n\n    2Both the district court and this court denied Costigan's\nrequest for release pending appeal.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f           In United States v. Meade, 175 F.3d 215 (1st Cir.\n\n1999), we rejected a vagueness challenge to § 922(g)(9),\n\nreciting, that \"[i]t is, after all, fair to presume that a\n\nmisdemeanant will know his relationship with his victim.\"\n\nId. at 222.    The precise issue posed by the instant case,\n\nhowever, was not present in           Meade because Meade's prior\n\nmisdemeanor conviction had been for assaulting his spouse.\n\nCostigan   argues    that    living     together     as   boyfriend   and\n\ngirlfriend (which is how he describes his relationship with\n\nSantos) does not give sufficient notice that he can not\n\npossess    a   firearm      if   convicted     of     assaulting      that\n\ngirlfriend.     He   also    argues     that   his    conduct   did    not\n\nfactually support the definition because he and Santos had\n\na stormy relationship in which marriage was not contemplated\n\nand, he said, he only sporadically lived with Santos and, at\n\nother times, lived at an apartment attached to his mother's\n\nhome.\n\n           We review de novo a contention that a criminal\n\nstatute is unconstitutionally vague.            See United States v.\n\nBohai Trading Co., Inc., 45 F.3d 577, 580 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nAnd, we review a vagueness challenge, not involving First\n\nAmendment freedoms, in light of the facts of the case at\n\nhand.     See United States v.        Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 550\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f(1975).     With that framework in mind, we reject Costigan's\n\nvagueness challenge.\n\n            Among     the   factors       that     the    district      court\n\nconsidered in determining whether the government had proved\n\nthat Costigan and Santos were cohabiting as spouses were the\n\nlength of the relationship; shared residence as indicated by\n\nspending the night and keeping one's belongings at the\n\nresidence; intimate relations; expectations of fidelity and\n\nmonogamy; shared household duties; regularly sharing meals\n\ntogether;     joint     assumption     of    child       care;      providing\n\nfinancial support; moving as a family unit; joint recreation\n\nand     socialization;      and     recognition          of   the    live-in\n\nrelationship by family and friends as indicated by visits to\n\nthe   residence.        These     factors    are    both      relevant    and\n\nsupported by the evidence.\n\n            Costigan met Maria Santos in October or November\n\n1995.     He moved in with her and her three children from\n\nprior marriages soon thereafter and he and Santos shared a\n\nsexual relationship.        Costigan kept his clothes at their\n\nhome in a dresser purchased for that purpose.                    The couple\n\nand Santos's children moved to an apartment that Costigan\n\nfound for them.       The couple and the children ate together as\n\na family and had a regular Tuesday family pizza night.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fCostigan    built     a     fence    at     the        new    apartment.          He\n\nparticipated in the discipline of the children, played with\n\nthem, gave them money, attended their school activities and\n\nformed a bond with them.            Costigan's relatives visited and\n\nconsidered the couple as living together.\n\n            \"The constitutional requirement of definiteness is\n\nviolated by a criminal statute that fails to give a person\n\nof ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated\n\nconduct is forbidden by the statute.\"                   See United States v.\n\nHarriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617 (1954).                     A person of ordinary\n\nintelligence      would     view    the     facts       recited    above     as    a\n\ndescription of Costigan cohabiting with Santos as a spouse.\n\nDuring the course of their relationship, Costigan assaulted\n\nSantos in December 1995, was convicted of this assault in\n\nFebruary 1996, assaulted Santos again in June 1996, was\n\nconvicted of this second assault in September 1996, and\n\nallegedly assaulted Santos a third time in October 1999.                           A\n\nrifle was found in Costigan's possession at the time of the\n\nOctober    1999    incident,        leading       to    the    firearm      charge\n\nunderlying this appeal.            In defining domestic violence, the\n\nstatutory    phrase       \"cohabiting       ...    with      the   victim    as    a\n\nspouse,\" gave Costigan fair notice that his conduct of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fpossessing a firearm after his convictions for assaulting\n\nSantos was forbidden.\n\n            Costigan also argued below and reiterates on appeal\n\nhis claim that § 922(g)(9) exceeds Congress's power under\n\nthe Commerce Clause because possession of a firearm by a\n\nperson convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\n\nis not economic activity and is without substantial impact\n\nupon    interstate     commerce.     Rather,     he   argues,      curbing\n\ndomestic violence is properly assigned to state law.                    As\n\nwith the constitutional challenge based on vagueness, we\n\nreview de novo a statutory challenge based on the Commerce\n\nClause.    See United States v. Cardoza, 129 F.3d 6, 10 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n            Costigan relies on United States v. Morrison, 120\n\nS. Ct. 1740 (2000), in which the Court held that Congress\n\nlacked authority to enact the Violence Against Women Act\n\n(\"VAWA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 13981, under the Commerce Clause.                The\n\nCourt found that (i) gender-motivated crimes of violence are\n\nnot    economic   in   nature,   (ii)    VAWA   did   not   contain    any\n\njurisdictional element, and (iii) the Congressional findings\n\nregarding the impact on interstate commerce inappropriately\n\nblurred    the    distinction      between      national     and     local\n\nauthority.    Id. at 1751-54.      Costigan argues that nothing in\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f the statutory history of § 922(g)(9) shows that possession\n\n of firearms by persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of\n\n domestic violence has any appreciable impact on interstate\n\n commerce    and,       to   the    extent       that    §   922(g)(9)   seeks   to\n\n prevent possession of firearms, it regulates purely local\n\n activity.\n\n             Section 922(g)(9) is unlike the VAWA.                        Section\n\n 922(g)(9)     is       subject      to    an     interstate      jurisdictional\n\n requirement       in    that      the    firearm       must   have   traveled   in\n\n interstate commerce.              Post-Morrison, courts have uniformly\n\n held that Morrison does not affect the conclusion that §\n\n 922(g) is within Congressional authority under the Commerce\n\n Clause.     See, e.g., United States v. Dorris, 236 F.3d 582,\n\n 585-86 (10th Cir. 2000) (reviewing § 922(g)(1)); United\n\n States v. Napier, 233 F.3d 394, 401-02 (6th Cir. 2000)\n\n (reviewing § 922(g)(8)); 3 United States v. Jones, 231 F.3d\n\n 508, 514-15 (9th Cir. 2000) (reviewing § 922(g)(8)); United\n\n States v. Wesela, 223 F.3d 656, 659-60 (7th Cir. 2000)\n\n (reviewing    §    922(g)(1)), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 1145\n\n (2001).     Apart from the express jurisdictional requirement\n\n\n\n    3Section 922(g)(8) is similar to § 922(g)(9) in that sub-\nsection (8) prohibits a person who is subject to a domestic\nviolence court order from possessing a firearm that has traveled\nin interstate commerce.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fthat the firearm have traveled in interstate commerce, the\n\nNapier and the Jones courts distinguished Morrison by the\n\nnature of the subject matter of the statutes involved.    The\n\nVAWA regulated a purely intrastate non-commercial activity,\n\nwhile § 922(g)(8) regulates the possession of firearms, a\n\nproduct of interstate commerce.      United States v. Napier,\n\n233 F.3d at 401-02; United States v. Jones, 231 F.3d at 514-\n\n15.   Costigan does not even mention these post-Morrison\n\ncases, much less distinguish them.      We reject Costigan's\n\nCommerce Clause challenge to § 922(g)(9).\n\n         Finally, Costigan contends that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in imposing a three year term of\n\nsupervised release.    See U.S.S.G. §5D1.1(b) (permitting, but\n\nnot requiring, the court to order a term of supervised\n\nrelease to follow imprisonment when a sentence of one year\n\nor less is imposed).    In deciding whether to impose a term\n\nof supervised release, the court \"may consider the need for\n\na term of supervised release to facilitate the reintegration\n\nof the defendant into the community; to enforce a fine,\n\nrestitution order, or other condition; or to fulfill any\n\nother purpose authorized by statute.\"        U.S.S.G. §5D1.1,\n\ncomment. (n.2).\n\n\n\n\n                              -9-\n\f             Costigan did not object below to the imposition of\n\na term of supervised release.                We, therefore, review this\n\nclaim for plain error.             See United States v. Paradis, 219\n\nF.3d   22,   25    (1st     Cir.   2000).       In    fashion    similar     to\n\ndefendant Paradis, see id., Costigan does little more than\n\nsimply argue that three years of supervised release is\n\nunnecessary.       At sentencing, the district court described\n\nCostigan as exactly the sort of person that Congress was\n\nconcerned with in enacting § 922(g)(9) and one who had not\n\ntaken responsibility for his life.              It also required, as an\n\nadditional condition of supervised release, that Costigan\n\nparticipate       in    a   program    of    mental    health     treatment,\n\nincluding     a    batterer's       intervention           program.      These\n\ndeterminations, fully supported by the evidence, attest to\n\nthe need to facilitate Costigan's reintegration into the\n\ncommunity. See U.S.S.G. §5D.1.1, comment. (n.2).                      They also\n\nestablish     that     Costigan     has     failed    to    demonstrate    \"an\n\nobvious and clear error under law that seriously affect[s]\n\nthe fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"          United States v.       Paradis, 219 F.3d at 25\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n             The judgment of the district court is summarily\n\naffirmed.     Loc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f",

The precise issue posed by the instant case,\n\nhowever, was not present in           Meade because Meade's prior\n\nmisdemeanor conviction had been for assaulting his spouse.\n\nCostigan   argues    that    living     together     as   boyfriend   and\n\ngirlfriend (which is how he describes his relationship with\n\nSantos) does not give sufficient notice that he can not\n\npossess    a   firearm      if   convicted     of     assaulting      that\n\ngirlfriend.     He   also    argues     that   his    conduct   did    not\n\nfactually support the definition because he and Santos had\n\na stormy relationship in which marriage was not contemplated\n\nand, he said, he only sporadically lived with Santos and, at\n\nother times, lived at an apartment attached to his mother's\n\nhome.\n\n           We review de novo a contention that a criminal\n\nstatute is unconstitutionally vague.

With that framework in mind, we reject Costigan's\n\nvagueness challenge.\n\n            Among     the   factors       that     the    district      court\n\nconsidered in determining whether the government had proved\n\nthat Costigan and Santos were cohabiting as spouses were the\n\nlength of the relationship; shared residence as indicated by\n\nspending the night and keeping one's belongings at the\n\nresidence; intimate relations; expectations of fidelity and\n\nmonogamy; shared household duties; regularly sharing meals\n\ntogether;     joint     assumption     of    child       care;      providing\n\nfinancial support; moving as a family unit; joint recreation\n\nand     socialization;      and     recognition          of   the    live-in\n\nrelationship by family and friends as indicated by visits to\n\nthe   residence.        These     factors    are    both      relevant    and\n\nsupported by the evidence.\n\n            Costigan met Maria Santos in October or November\n\n1995.     He moved in with her and her three children from\n\nprior marriages soon thereafter and he and Santos shared a\n\nsexual relationship.        Costigan kept his clothes at their\n\nhome in a dresser purchased for that purpose.                    The couple\n\nand Santos's children moved to an apartment that Costigan\n\nfound for them.       The couple and the children ate together as\n\na family and had a regular Tuesday family pizza night.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fCostigan    built     a     fence    at     the        new    apartment.          He\n\nparticipated in the discipline of the children, played with\n\nthem, gave them money, attended their school activities and\n\nformed a bond with them.

A person of ordinary\n\nintelligence      would     view    the     facts       recited    above     as    a\n\ndescription of Costigan cohabiting with Santos as a spouse.\n\nDuring the course of their relationship, Costigan assaulted\n\nSantos in December 1995, was convicted of this assault in\n\nFebruary 1996, assaulted Santos again in June 1996, was\n\nconvicted of this second assault in September 1996, and\n\nallegedly assaulted Santos a third time in October 1999.                           A\n\nrifle was found in Costigan's possession at the time of the\n\nOctober    1999    incident,        leading       to    the    firearm      charge\n\nunderlying this appeal.            In defining domestic violence, the\n\nstatutory    phrase       \"cohabiting       ...    with      the   victim    as    a\n\nspouse,\" gave Costigan fair notice that his conduct of\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fpossessing a firearm after his convictions for assaulting\n\nSantos was forbidden.\n\n            Costigan also argued below and reiterates on appeal\n\nhis claim that § 922(g)(9) exceeds Congress's power under\n\nthe Commerce Clause because possession of a firearm by a\n\nperson convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\n\nis not economic activity and is without substantial impact\n\nupon    interstate     commerce.     Rather,     he   argues,      curbing\n\ndomestic violence is properly assigned to state law.                    As\n\nwith the constitutional challenge based on vagueness, we\n\nreview de novo a statutory challenge based on the Commerce\n\nClause.    See United States v.

The\n\nCourt found that (i) gender-motivated crimes of violence are\n\nnot    economic   in   nature,   (ii)    VAWA   did   not   contain    any\n\njurisdictional element, and (iii) the Congressional findings\n\nregarding the impact on interstate commerce inappropriately\n\nblurred    the    distinction      between      national     and     local\n\nauthority.    Id. at 1751-54.      Costigan argues that nothing in\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f the statutory history of § 922(g)(9) shows that possession\n\n of firearms by persons convicted of misdemeanor crimes of\n\n domestic violence has any appreciable impact on interstate\n\n commerce    and,       to   the    extent       that    §   922(g)(9)   seeks   to\n\n prevent possession of firearms, it regulates purely local\n\n activity.\n\n             Section 922(g)(9) is unlike the VAWA.                        Section\n\n 922(g)(9)     is       subject      to    an     interstate      jurisdictional\n\n requirement       in    that      the    firearm       must   have   traveled   in\n\n interstate commerce.              Post-Morrison, courts have uniformly\n\n held that Morrison does not affect the conclusion that §\n\n 922(g) is within Congressional authority under the Commerce\n\n Clause.

Apart from the express jurisdictional requirement\n\n\n\n    3Section 922(g)(8) is similar to § 922(g)(9) in that sub-\nsection (8) prohibits a person who is subject to a domestic\nviolence court order from possessing a firearm that has traveled\nin interstate commerce.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fthat the firearm have traveled in interstate commerce, the\n\nNapier and the Jones courts distinguished Morrison by the\n\nnature of the subject matter of the statutes involved.    The\n\nVAWA regulated a purely intrastate non-commercial activity,\n\nwhile § 922(g)(8) regulates the possession of firearms, a\n\nproduct of interstate commerce.      United States v. Napier,\n\n233 F.3d at 401-02; United States v. Jones, 231 F.3d at 514-\n\n15.   Costigan does not even mention these post-Morrison\n\ncases, much less distinguish them.      We reject Costigan's\n\nCommerce Clause challenge to § 922(g)(9).\n\n         Finally, Costigan contends that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in imposing a three year term of\n\nsupervised release.    See U.S.S.G. §5D1.1(b) (permitting, but\n\nnot requiring, the court to order a term of supervised\n\nrelease to follow imprisonment when a sentence of one year\n\nor less is imposed).    In deciding whether to impose a term\n\nof supervised release, the court \"may consider the need for\n\na term of supervised release to facilitate the reintegration\n\nof the defendant into the community; to enforce a fine,\n\nrestitution order, or other condition; or to fulfill any\n\nother purpose authorized by statute.\"        U.S.S.G. §5D1.1,\n\ncomment. (n.2).\n\n\n\n\n                              -9-\n\f             Costigan did not object below to the imposition of\n\na term of supervised release.                We, therefore, review this\n\nclaim for plain error.             See United States v. Paradis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199005\"><a href=\"/opinion/199005/united-states-v-paradis/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>   <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   25    (1st     Cir.   2000).       In    fashion    similar     to\n\ndefendant Paradis, see id., Costigan does little more than\n\nsimply argue that three years of supervised release is\n\nunnecessary.       At sentencing, the district court described\n\nCostigan as exactly the sort of person that Congress was\n\nconcerned with in enacting § 922(g)(9) and one who had not\n\ntaken responsibility for his life.              It also required, as an\n\nadditional condition of supervised release, that Costigan\n\nparticipate       in    a   program    of    mental    health     treatment,\n\nincluding     a    batterer's       intervention           program.      These\n\ndeterminations, fully supported by the evidence, attest to\n\nthe need to facilitate Costigan's reintegration into the\n\ncommunity. See U.S.S.G. §5D.1.1, comment. (n.2).                      They also\n\nestablish     that     Costigan     has     failed    to    demonstrate    \"an\n\nobvious and clear error under law that seriously affect[s]\n\nthe fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"          United States v.       Paradis, 219 F.3d at 25\n\n(citation omitted).\n\n             The judgment of the district court is summarily\n\naffirmed.     Loc.
