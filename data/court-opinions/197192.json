These are  two consolidated\r                                            \r\n\nappeals.  One is  brought by plaintiff Eugene Anderson,  a Boston\r\n\npublic school teacher, contesting  directed verdicts on all seven\r\n\nclaims he brought  against his then principal, Thomas P. O'Neill,\r\n\nJr.,  and the  Boston  School  Committee.    In  the  other,  the\r\n\ndefendants appeal  from the district court's  denial of sanctions\r\n\nand  an  attorney's fee  award.   In  the plaintiff's  appeal, we\r\n\naffirm the judgment.   In the defendants' appeal, we  deem this a\r\n\ncase where we  feel we need  the reasoning of the  district court\r\n\nand so remand.\r\n\n                I.  Plaintiff's Appeal: The Merits\r\n\n     At  this  juncture, there  are  directed  verdicts on  seven\r\n\ncounts  which are  contested by  plaintiff1, as  well  as several\r\n\nevidentiary rulings.  The litigation resulted in  over 100 docket\r\n\nentries  from complaint to filing  the notice of  appeal and five\r\n\ndays  of jury  trial,  at  the end  of  which  the court  granted\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1  The counts and the affected defendant(s) are as follows:\r\n\n          I.

Intentional   Infliction  of   Emotional\r\n                    Distress, against O'Neill. \r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\ndefendants' motions  for directed verdict.   We have meticulously\r\n\nreviewed both the  transcript and  the exhibits.   The smoke  now\r\n\ndissipated,  we are compelled to conclude that there is no longer\r\n\nany discernible fire.    In view  of  the fact  that  such  ample\r\n\nopportunity was afforded below to  pursue all avenues in  support\r\n\nof the claims, we do not feel it incumbent on us to replay all of\r\n\nthe  evidence.  We shall content ourselves with a capsule summary\r\n\nof  events and  a brief  consideration of  the viability  of each\r\n\nclaim as of the end of the evidence.\r\n\n     Factual Background.  Plaintiff, a black person,2 had been  a\r                                 \r\n\npublic school teacher  for ten years  when, in  1989, he drew  an\r\n\nassignment  as an  art  teacher to  the Solomon  Lewenberg Middle\r\n\nSchool  in Mattapan, of which  O'Neill was the  principal.  There\r\n\nwas  an obvious  miscommunication, for  when  plaintiff appeared,\r\n\nO'Neill felt that there  was no vacancy because another  teacher,\r\n\nMolloy, a white person, had already filled it.  He sent plaintiff\r\n\nback  twice, but plaintiff finally  was placed in  the school, in\r\n\naddition  to Molloy,  and  given an  adequate  room, only  to  be\r\n\nreassigned to a less  satisfactory room shortly after.3   He also\r\n\nhad trouble obtaining adequate art  supplies.  Soon after arrival\r\n\nat  the school,  plaintiff  was asked  to  attend an  orientation\r\n\nmeeting;  when he arrived, O'Neill accused him of breaking a lock\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2    The  parties use  both the  terms \"black\"  and \"African\r\nAmerican;\" we will use \"black\" here for the sake of ease.   \r\n\n     3   The room  had no  storage closet, but  did have  an open\r\nstorage area.  It  was large, well-lighted by windows,  and had a\r\nwall length blackboard.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\nat the art room.  In fact, plaintiff said, there was a door hinge\r\n\nwithout any lock on it.  Apparently there were no consequences to\r\n\nthis incident.\r\n\n     Later in September  and in October,  O'Neill visited two  of\r\n\nplaintiff's  art  classes  for  45 and  55  minutes  and prepared\r\n\nevaluations of  his teaching.   Plaintiff was criticized  for his\r\n\nlesson planning, classroom management, and maintaining a learning\r\n\nenvironment, but was given satisfactory ratings for other factors\r\n\nsuch as use of materials, treatment of students, and professional\r\n\ncooperation   Plaintiff responded vigorously to both evaluations.\r\n\n     O'Neill was on leave during the 1990-1991 school year during\r\n\nwhich time  Anderson had  one satisfactory evaluation  by another\r\n\nsuperior.   In September of  1991, when O'Neill  had returned, he\r\n\nsummoned  plaintiff to  a formal  hearing concerning  an incident\r\n\nwhen Anderson appeared at  school, allegedly with alcohol on  his\r\n\nbreath, detected  by the assistant principal,  Philogene, a black\r\n\nperson,  by another superior, Giacalone, and by others.  For this\r\n\nhe was given  a warning.  Later, in December  of 1991 and January\r\n\nof  1992,  O'Neill  issued  two  more  evaluations,  giving  many\r\n\n\"unsatisfactory\"  ratings and noting that students in plaintiff's\r\n\nclass  were  using  foul  language, playing  cards,  and  reading\r\n\ncomics.\r\n\n     Finally,  on January 24,  1992, O'Neill  was visited  in his\r\n\noffice by three  black girl  students who wanted  to talk to  him\r\n\nabout Anderson's behavior.  Two of them complained that plaintiff\r\n\nhad made sexual advances  to them by touching them  and by making\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\ninappropriate remarks.   The third stated  that she had  observed\r\n\nsuch conduct.  They also said that he had made unwanted telephone\r\n\ncalls to them at home.  O'Neill then consulted with the office of\r\n\nthe  East  Zone  Superintendent  of the  Boston  Public  Schools,\r\n\nClifford B. Janey, the city's General Counsel, and the Department\r\n\nof Safety.  Janey, a black person, in turn  instructed O'Neill to\r\n\nconduct  a full  investigation.   This  was undertaken,  although\r\n\nthere is no evidence detailing how  it began, how the police were\r\n\ninvolved, or what steps were taken.  In early February, plaintiff\r\n\nwas relieved of  his duties and  transferred pending hearing  and\r\n\nresolution.   A criminal complaint  was later filed  after a show\r\n\ncause hearing.  A bench trial in the spring of 1993 resulted in a\r\n\njudgment of guilty, but  later a jury trial in  December resulted\r\n\nin a not guilty verdict.\r\n\n     This suit was filed shortly thereafter.\r\n\n     Analysis: \r                       \r\n\n          Racial discrimination. We first consider  the claims of\r                                         \r\n\nracial discrimination, which are embraced  by Counts I (42 U.S.C.\r\n\n 1983), II  (42 U.S.C.  2000e et  seq.), and IV (Mass.  Gen. Laws\r\n\nch. 151B).  The striking  fact about this case is that  after all\r\n\nof the discovery  and five days of  trial, no evidence  of either\r\n\npretext or  racially motivated  discrimination was  presented for\r\n\njury consideration.   No  conversations evidencing  racial animus\r\n\nwere presented,  nor any instances of  unexplained more favorable\r\n\ntreatment of similarly  situated whites.   There was no  evidence\r\n\nthat the accusations of  lock breaking or of appearing  at school\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nunder the influence  of alcohol were  racially motivated or  even\r\n\ninitiated by  Principal O'Neill.   As  for the  evaluations, they\r\n\ncould possibly be viewed by a jury as  stemming from too rigorous\r\n\na sense of  management, order,  and discipline, but  there is  no\r\n\nracial  innuendo in  O'Neill's extensive  notations, discussions,\r\n\nand suggestions for improvement.\r\n\n     Indeed, plaintiff acknowledges all this in  his motion for a\r\n\nnew  trial, where, in arguing  that the court  erred in excluding\r\n\nevidence of the subsequent in-house handling of sexual harassment\r\n\nclaims  against  two  white  school employees,  he  argued:  \"The\r\n\nadmission of  this evidence would  have provided the  'race' that\r\n\nthe  Court  was looking  for at  Directed  Verdict.\"   Unless the\r\n\nexclusion  of this evidence was  reversible error, the charges of\r\n\nracial  discrimination  must  be  held  not  to be  supported  by\r\n\nevidence sufficient to reach a jury.\r\n\n     The  evidence  proffered  was  that, six  months  after  the\r\n\ncomplaints   against  plaintiff,   two  white   Lewenberg  School\r\n\nemployees were accused of inappropriate sexual  conduct involving\r\n\nfemale  students.  (A custodian was accused of kissing a student,\r\n\nand a   shop  teacher  was accused  of telling  a student,  found\r\n\nhiding  under  a  stairway, that  she  would  have  to \"kiss  the\r\n\nteacher\" before she  would be let out.)   In both instances,  the\r\n\ncomplaints  were handled  without involving  the police,  through\r\n\nmeetings  with  the  students, the  employees,  a  parent,  and a\r\n\nguardian.  Plaintiff argues that O'Neill's failure to call in the\r\n\npolice and to require signed statements, and his personal meeting\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nwith the students  and parents contrasts  sharply with what  took\r\n\nplace after the complaints were lodged against plaintiff.\r\n\n     Plaintiff faces the  considerable hurdle of establishing  an\r\n\nabuse of  discretion  by  the district  court  in  excluding  the\r\n\nevidence.   That court's  basic determination was  that plaintiff\r\n\nhad not carried  his burden  of showing that  the white  employee\r\n\ncases were \"similarly situated\" to that of plaintiff, in order to\r\n\nlay a  basis for the  admission of  the evidence.   In the  first\r\n\nplace there is no evidence that there was any precise policy that\r\n\nmandated a specific course of action that in practice was applied\r\n\ndifferently  to whites and blacks.  Certainly the manner in which\r\n\nO'Neill  sought and  followed  guidance in  following  up on  the\r\n\ncomplaints  against plaintiff does not suggest any predisposition\r\n\nto  treat plaintiff any differently from anyone else found in his\r\n\npredicament.\r\n\n     But,  most pertinently,  a simultaneous  complaint by  three\r\n\nfemale  students  involving  touching,  suggestive  remarks,  and\r\n\nobservation  of  other  such  conduct,  together   with  unwanted\r\n\ntelephone  calls at  home, would seem  to involve  a demonstrably\r\n\ndifferent order  of magnitude  than the solitary  charges against\r\n\nthe two white employees.  See Perkins v. Brigham &amp; Women's Hosp.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n78  F.3d  747,  751 (1st  Cir.  1996).    Moreover,  there is  no\r\n\nindication  that  any  changes   in  approach  had  been  invoked\r\n\nsubsequent  to the  January  complaints.   We  conclude that  the\r\n\ndistrict court did  not exceed  its discretion  in excluding  the\r\n\nevidence.                 \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n\n     Libel  and Slander.   Plaintiff relies  heavily on  the four\r                                 \r\n\nperformance evaluations made by  O'Neill to make out a  jury case\r\n\nof  defamation.   But  these, as  well  as statements  concerning\r\n\nplaintiff's  breaking  a lock  and  his  \"erratic\" behavior,  are\r\n\nsubject to the qualified privilege  of an employer or  supervisor\r\n\nto   monitor,  discuss,  and  attempt  to  improve  subordinates'\r\n\nperformance.    Much of  what plaintiff  complains about  was not\r\n\ncontested.  Much was obviously the Principal's opinion as to what\r\n\nwas good or bad educational practice.   But none of it could have\r\n\nbeen  found to have been knowingly false or in reckless disregard\r\n\nof the truth.   Judd v.

Even  his own\r\n\nself-serving  testimony  on cross  examination  that  one of  the\r\n\ncomplainants against him, April  Allen, told him that O'Neill  in\r\n\ntalking with her twice  said that he had seen  plaintiff touching\r\n\nher,  contrary to  her own  supposed belief,  falls far  short of\r\n\nindicating any such pressure on her which could forcefully impact\r\n\non him.\r\n\n     Malicious  Prosecution.    Plaintiff  contends  that he  has\r                                     \r\n\nfulfilled   the   two   threshold   requirements   of   malicious\r\n\nprosecution: initiation of  criminal proceedings with  malice and\r\n\nwithout probable  cause, and  termination of such  proceedings in\r\n\nhis favor.  He fails on both counts.  First, there is no evidence\r\n\nof precisely how the criminal proceedings were initiated.  As the\r\n\nMassachusetts Appeals  Court noted  in Ziemba v.  Fo'cs'le, Inc.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n475 N.E.2d  1223, 1226  (Mass. App.  Ct. 1985), even  the act  of\r\n\ncalling the police is not the equivalent of instituting  criminal\r\n\nproceedings.  It may well be that such a decision was made by the\r\n\npolice themselves.\r\n\n     Equally   important,  the   fact  that   the  bench   trial,\r\n\nunimpeached by any evidence of perjury by  defendant O'Neill (who\r\n\ndid not testify  at either  the show cause  hearing or the  bench\r\n\ntrial), or of subornation  of perjury, resulted in a  judgment of\r\n\nguilty is  a complete bar to the action.  Della Jacova v. Widett,\r                                                                          \r\n\n                               -10-\r\r\n\n244 N.E.2d 580, 582 (Mass. 1969).  It should not  be necessary to\r\n\nadd that  plaintiff's testimony  of an  alleged statement  by his\r\n\naccuser April Allen concerning O'Neill's supposed statements that\r\n\nhe  had seen plaintiff lay hands on  her, may not be dignified as\r\n\nevidence of subornation of perjury.\r\n\n     Intentional  Infliction of  Emotional Distress.   Again, the\r                                                             \r\n\nMassachusetts  Supreme Judicial  Court has  sharply circumscribed\r\n\nthe reach of this tort.  In Sena v. Commonwealth, 629 N.E.2d 986,\r                                                          \r\n\n994  (Mass. 1994)  the court stated  that to  sustain a  claim of\r\n\nintentional infliction of  emotional distress,  a plaintiff  must\r\n\nshow  1) that  the defendant  intended to  cause, or  should have\r\n\nknown  that his conduct would cause,  emotional distress; 2) that\r\n\nthe  defendant's conduct was extreme  and outrageous; 3) that the\r\n\ndefendant's conduct caused the  plaintiff's distress; and 4) that\r\n\nthe  plaintiff  suffered severe  distress.  Id.  (citing Agis  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nHoward Johnson Co.,  355 N.E.2d 315, 318 (Mass. 1976).   The Agis\r                                                                           \r\n\ncourt  cited approvingly  such language  as \"beyond  all possible\r\n\nbounds  of  decency\"  and  \"utterly intolerable  in  a  civilized\r\n\ncommunity.\"   355 N.E.2d at 319.  However one may view any of the\r\n\nactions attributable  to Principal O'Neill, one  could not fairly\r\n\napply any of these rubrics to them.                          \r\n\n     Evidentiary Issues.  Of  the three evidentiary issues argued\r                                 \r\n\nby  plaintiff,  we  have  already disposed  of  one,  the court's\r\n\nexclusion of  the evidence  concerning the  handling  of the  sex\r\n\nharassment complaints against the two white  employees.  A second\r\n\ninvolves  the granting of defendant's motion in limine to exclude\r\n\n                               -11-\r\r\n\nApril Allen's  statements about O'Neill's conversation  with her.\r\n\nBut,  as our above discussion reveals, the same testimony came in\r\n\non the cross examination of plaintiff.  We see no need to revisit\r\n\nin any detail what was already exposed.  \r\n\n     The  last claim is  simply that the  court excluded evidence\r\n\nthat early in 1992  O'Neill called into his office  the proffered\r\n\nwitness,  a former male student,  and another who  was accused of\r\n\nimproper conduct and  made them sign statements he  had prepared.\r\n\nPlaintiff  sees  this incident  as  evidence  of O'Neill's  modus\r\n\noperandi.  But O'Neill is not alleged to have engaged in any such\r\n\nconduct in this case;  his supposed statements to April  Allen of\r\n\nwhat he  said he  saw are of  an obviously  different modus  than\r\n\ncalling a student into  his office and forcing  the signing of  a\r\n\npreviously prepared  written statement.  The  evidence would have\r\n\nlittle relevance,  if any,  but would  have  been freighted  with\r\n\nprejudice.  The court did not abuse its discretion.\r\n\n               II.  Defendants' Appeal: Fees and Sanctions\r\n\n     Principal O'Neill  and the School Committee  appeal from the\r\n\ncourt's  denial of their motions for sanctions under Fed. R. Civ.\r\n\nP. 11 and 28 U.S.C.  1927 and for attorney's fees and costs under\r\n\n42 U.S.C.  1988.\r\n\n     The procedural background is brief.  In their answers to the\r\n\ncomplaint, in  early 1994,  appellants invoked violation  of Rule\r\n\n11.  Nothing  transpired on  the sanctions front  until April  of\r\n\n1995,  when  appellants  sent   counsel  for  Anderson  a  letter\r\n\nprotesting the allegations and serving notice that, if trial were\r\n\n                               -12-\r\r\n\nto take place, they would pursue their Rule 11 remedy.   The next\r\n\nevent  took place on February  27, 1996, shortly  after the court\r\n\nhad  directed the verdicts, when  appellants filed a  new Rule 11\r\n\nmotion.   This, however, was  filed without having  waited for 21\r\n\ndays after service before filing, as required by   c(1)(A) of the\r\n\nrule.   It  was denied  on March  15 and on  March 18  an amended\r\n\nmotion, with additional allegations, was served;  it was filed on\r\n\nApril 16,  1996.  In mid-March  motions were filed under     1927\r\n\nand  1988.   All  were  denied by  the  court without  hearing or\r\n\ncomment in late March and early April.\r\n\n     Appellants base their claims for sanctions on what they term\r\n\nunfounded and  uninvestigated allegations of  race discrimination\r\n\non   the    part   of    O'Neill;    allegations   of    systemic\r\n\nunderrepresentation of  blacks in Lewenberg School and elsewhere,\r\n\ntogether with discriminatory policies  and customs resulting from\r\n\nreckless  indifference on  the part  of the  city and  the School\r\n\nCommittee; misleading and erroneous  damages evidence on the part\r\n\nof Anderson; and allegations of  false accusations of alcohol and\r\n\ndrug abuse, coercion of young female students, and perjury on the\r\n\npart of O'Neill.\r\n\n     Anderson  merely presents the same facts  in haec verba from\r\n\nhis main brief, reargues that the district  court was in error in\r\n\ndirecting the  verdicts, contends  that he had  established prima\r\n\nfacie  cases on  every count,  and points  out that  he dismissed\r\n\nclaims for disparate impact and municipal (Monell) liability.  He\r                                                           \r\n\ncited   no  cases.      He  dismisses   appellants'  motions   as\r\n\n                               -13-\r\r\n\n\"incomprehensible, not timely, violating every 'safe harbor' rule\r\n\nknown, and, generally, . . . a waste of everybody's time.\"\r\n\n     The questions  which this background presented  to the court\r\n\ninvolved  the procedural one of timeliness and undue delay of the\r\n\nvarious  motions  and  the  substantive  ones  whether reasonable\r\n\ninquiry  was made  by plaintiff's counsel, Ryan v.  Clemente, 901\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  177 (1st Cir. 1990),  and whether claims  were unfounded or\r\n\nwere  so revealed  as  the case  progressed.   The  motions  also\r\n\nimplicitly  involved the  allocation  of  responsibility, if  any\r\n\nexisted, between plaintiff  and his counsel.   The only  question\r\n\nwhich  faces us  at this  juncture, however,  is whether  we have\r\n\nenough basis to affirm, to modify, or to reverse.\r\n\n     We are  therefore  required  to focus  sharply  on  our  own\r\n\nprecedents  in order to  determine whether the  district court in\r\n\ndenying sanctions and fees  in this case should have  accompanied\r\n\nthose decisions with some  explanation.  We tread  very carefully\r\n\nin this  area, for the district court is entitled not only to the\r\n\nordinary deference due the  trial judge, and additional deference\r\n\nin the  entire area of sanctions, but  extraordinary deference in\r\n\ndenying sanctions.  \r\n\n     Appellants  make  the broad  argument,  based  on a  blanket\r\n\nobservation in Metrocorps,  Inc. v. Eastern  Mass. Junior Drum  &amp;\r                                                                           \r\n\nBugle Corps Ass'n., 912 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1990), that,  whether\r                            \r\n\nor not sanctions are ordered or denied, reasons must be given, if\r\n\nmeaningful  review is to be  had.  In  Metrocorps, sanctions were\r                                                           \r\n\nsought  because of  a party's  failure  to comply  with discovery\r\n\n                               -14-\r\r\n\nrequirements.   Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  37, however,  specifies  that\r\n\nsanctions  may be  avoided only  if substantial  justification is\r\n\nshown.  We held that \"[t]he  clear language of the rule imposes a\r\n\nduty on the  district court.\" Id.  at 2.   We also addressed  the\r                                           \r\n\nalternative  ground for sanctions,  Rule 11, and  cited Morgan v.\r                                                                        \r\n\nMassachusetts  General  Hospital, 901  F.2d  186,  195 (1st  Cir.\r                                          \r\n\n1990),  which  in turn  cited Carlucci  v. Piper  Aircraft Corp.,\r                                                                           \r\n\nInc., 775 F.2d  1440, 1446-47  (11th Cir. 1985)  for the  general\r              \r\n\nproposition  that a district court  must state reasons  so that a\r\n\nmeaningful review may be had.  We then went on to say, \"[i]f this\r\n\nis the  district court's  burden when  sanctions are  imposed, it\r\n\nfollows  naturally that  a  similar obligation  exists where,  as\r\n\nhere, sanctions are  requested by  one party, but  denied by  the\r\n\ncourt.\"  901 F.2d at 195.  \r\n\n     But  Carlucci  itself  not only  addressed  the  unexplained\r                            \r\n\npositive imposition of sanctions,  but a discovery sanction under\r\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 37 limited to \"reasonable expenses  caused by the\r\n\nfailure\" to obey  an order.  Understandably,  the appellate court\r\n\nfelt it needed some  basis on which to review  the reasonableness\r\n\nof  the amount.  Moreover, in Morgan, where the hospital's motion\r                                              \r\n\nfor  fees  had  been  denied  without  reasons,  we prefaced  our\r\n\nanalysis with the observation that \"From the record before us, we\r\n\nare unable to determine the basis of the district court's denial\"\r\n\nof the motion.  901 F.2d at 195.  We added  that the fee decision\r\n\n\"must  both be  explained and  be supported  by the  record.\" Id.\r                                                                           \r\n\nThese statements,  of course,  were sufficient to  have justified\r\n\n                               -15-\r\r\n\nour action  in requiring reasons, without resort  to the Carlucci\r                                                                           \r\n\nblanket prescription.\r\n\n     Later, in  the same year,  in Figueroa-Ruiz v.  Alegria, 905\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d  545, 549 (1st Cir. 1990), we  remanded a case in which Rule\r\n\n11 sanctions had been denied, because we found the decision to \r\n\nbe capable of bearing a number of meanings.  We added:\r\n\n     While  we do not hold that the district court must make\r\n     findings and give explanations every time a party seeks\r\n     sanctions under Rule 11, we do require a statement when\r\n     the reason for  the decision is not obvious or apparent\r\n     from the record.\r\n\nWe then cited, with a see, Morgan.\r                                           \r\n\n     Then  came Metrocorps, with  no reference  to Figueroa-Ruiz.\r                                                                          \r\n\nFinally, in Witty  v. Dukakis, 3 F.3d 517  (1st Cir. 1993), where\r                                       \r\n\nthe  district court had, early on, denied a fee application under\r\n\n 1988  as   untimely,  and  later  denied   without  opinion  two\r\n\nsubsequent motions to revisit the issue, we said:\r\n\n     So long as a  district court's reason for  denying fees\r\n     or  monetary  sanctions   is  (1)  well   founded,  (2)\r\n     sufficient to the  stated end, and (3) apparent  on the\r\n     face  of  the record,  a  reviewing  tribunal will  not\r\n     insist on unnecessary punctilio. (Citing, among others,\r\n     Figueroa-Ruiz and Morgan, but  not Metrocorps.)  Id. at\r                                                                   \r\n     521.\r\n\nWe  observed  that it  was  \"perfectly  clear that  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  thinking had not changed\" between the first and last two\r\n\ndecisions. Id.\r                        \r\n\n     From these precedents, we discern the continuing basic theme\r\n\nthat although the rationale for a  denial of a motion for fees or\r\n\nsanctions under Rule 11,  1927, or   1988 should be unambiguously\r\n\ncommunicated, the lack of explicit findings is not fatal where   \r\n\n                               -16-\r\r\n\nthe record itself, evidence or colloquy, clearly indicates one or\r\n\nmore sufficient  supporting reasons.   The  occasional statements\r\n\nreferring to  an inflexible requirement for  explicit findings in\r\n\nevery case do not reflect our present considered judgment.\r\n\n     Reflection reveals that appellate  review of denials of such\r\n\nmotions calls for somewhat more restraint than review of positive\r\n\nactions  imposing  sanctions and  shifting fees.   In  the latter\r\n\nevent the  decision of the trial  court is a relatively  rare and\r\n\nalways  deliberate event.  In the former event, motions are often\r\n\nperfunctorily made  and generally denied.  To  require in run-of-\r\n\nthe-mill cases, where it  is obvious that the conduct of  a party\r\n\nand  his attorney was within  the bounds of  reason, decency, and\r\n\ncompetence, that the trial court stop and frame specific findings\r\n\nwould be to add irresponsibly to its already considerable burden.\r\n\n     In  this case,  however,  a number  of  factors coalesce  to\r\n\nconvince us of the need for help from the district court.  In the\r\n\nfirst place, we need its assessment of the weight of arguments as\r\n\nto  untimeliness  and  undue delay  in  the  pursuit  of Rule  11\r\n\nsanctions.    We are also  unable to ascertain without  such help\r\n\nwhether  \"reasonable inquiry\"  was made  of some  of the  charges\r\n\nlevied  by  plaintiff.    Should available  public  records  have\r\n\nindicated an absence of  systemic recklessness and discrimination\r\n\nin the Boston school system?  Were the alleged victims (Allen and\r\n\nO'Connor) of  plaintiff's advances  interviewed?  Why  were they,\r\n\nalthough present at  the courthouse, not  called as witnesses  by\r\n\nplaintiff?    Similar questions  are raised  in  our minds  as to\r\n\n                               -17-\r\r\n\nStutman, the  union representative, Philogene, who  initiated the\r\n\ncomplaint  of  alcohol  abuse,  other teachers,  police  and  the\r\n\nDepartment of Safety.   Were plaintiff's explanations  concerning\r\n\nthe missing tape consistent and credible?4\r\n\n     Finally, what  weight  should be  given,  if any,  to  prior\r\n\ncourt-administered warnings  to counsel.   One was our  own case,\r\n\nCummings v. Hanson, 1995 U.S.App.Vol.LEXIS 36978 (December 1995),\r                            \r\n\nin which we affirmed  sanctions against this plaintiff's attorney\r\n\nfor bringing a claim in the wrong forum and cautioned him against\r\n\nrepetition.    And  although  the   Massachusetts  Appeals  Court\r\n\ndecision in Doe  v. Nutter,  McClennen &amp; Fish,  668 N.E.2d  1329,\r                                                       \r\n\n1331  (41 Mass. App. Ct. 1996),  affirming sanctions and awarding\r\n\ndouble costs against  plaintiff's counsel in the instant case for\r\n\na frivolous appeal, was  issued subsequent to the actions  of the\r\n\ndistrict court  below in denying sanctions,  both a Massachusetts\r\n\nSuperior Court justice and a single  justice of the Massachusetts\r\n\nAppeals   Court   had   previously   imposed   sanctions  against\r\n\nplaintiff's attorney for filing suit against  defendants although\r\n\nhe was aware that he did not have a viable cause of action.\r\n\n     In  raising these  points,  we do  not  profess to  have  an\r\n\ninformed opinion.

O'Neill, Jr., and the Boston School Committee.  In the other, the defendants appeal from the district court's denial of sanctions and an attorney's fee award.  In the plaintiff's appeal, we affirm the judgment.  In the defendants' appeal, we deem this a case where we feel we need the reasoning of the district court and so remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Plaintiff's Appeal:  The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this juncture, there are directed verdicts on seven counts which are contested by plaintiff<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>, as well as several evidentiary rulings.  The litigation resulted in over 100 docket entries from complaint to filing the notice of appeal and five days of jury trial, at the end of which the court granted defendants' motions for directed verdict.  We have meticulously reviewed both the transcript and the exhibits.  The smoke now dissipated, we are compelled to conclude that there is no longer any discernible fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the fact that such ample opportunity was afforded below to pursue all avenues in support of the claims, we do not feel it incumbent on us to replay all of the evidence.  We shall content ourselves with a capsule summary of events and a brief consideration of the viability of each claim as of the end of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factual Background.   Plaintiff, a black person,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> had been a public school teacher for ten years when, in 1989, he drew an assignment as an art teacher to the Solomon Lewenberg Middle School in Mattapan, of which O'Neill was the principal.  There was an obvious miscommunication, for when plaintiff appeared, O'Neill felt that there was no vacancy because another teacher, Molloy, a white person, had already filled it.  He sent plaintiff back twice, but plaintiff finally was placed in the school, in addition to Molloy, and given an adequate room, only to be reassigned to a less satisfactory room shortly after.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  He also had trouble obtaining adequate art supplies.  Soon after arrival at the school, plaintiff was asked to attend an orientation meeting;  when he arrived, O'Neill accused him of breaking a lock at the art room.  In fact, plaintiff said, there was a door hinge without any lock on it.  Apparently there were no consequences to this incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in September and in October, O'Neill visited two of plaintiff's art classes for 45 and 55 minutes and prepared evaluations of his teaching.  Plaintiff was criticized for his lesson planning, classroom management, and maintaining a learning environment, but was given satisfactory ratings for other factors such as use of materials, treatment of students, and professional cooperation Plaintiff responded vigorously to both evaluations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Neill was on leave during the 1990-1991 school year during which time Anderson had one satisfactory evaluation by another superior.  In September of 1991, when O'Neill had returned, he summoned plaintiff to a formal hearing concerning an incident when Anderson appeared at school, allegedly with alcohol on his breath, detected by the assistant principal, Philogene, a black person, by another superior, Giacalone, and by others.  For this he was given a warning.  Later, in December of 1991 and January of 1992, O'Neill issued two more evaluations, giving many \"unsatisfactory\" ratings and noting that students in plaintiff's class were using foul language, playing cards, and reading comics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on January 24, 1992, O'Neill was visited in his office by three black girl students who wanted to talk to him about Anderson's behavior.  Two of them complained that plaintiff had made sexual advances to them by touching them and by making inappropriate remarks.  The third stated that she had observed such conduct.  They also said that he had made unwanted telephone calls to them at home.  O'Neill then consulted with the office of the East Zone Superintendent of the Boston Public Schools, Clifford B. Janey, the city's General Counsel, and the Department of Safety.  Janey, a black person, in turn instructed O'Neill to conduct a full investigation.  This was undertaken, although there is no evidence detailing how it began, how the police were involved, or what steps were taken.  In early February, plaintiff was relieved of his duties and transferred pending hearing and resolution.  A criminal complaint was later filed after a show cause hearing.  A bench trial in the spring of 1993 resulted in a judgment of guilty, but later a jury trial in December resulted in a not guilty verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This suit was filed shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Racial discrimination.   We first consider the claims of racial discrimination, which are embraced by Counts I (42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983), II (42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq.), and IV (Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  151B).  The striking fact about this case is that after all of the discovery and five days of trial, no evidence of either pretext or racially motivated discrimination was presented for jury consideration.  No conversations evidencing racial animus were presented, nor any instances of unexplained more favorable treatment of similarly situated whites.  There was no evidence that the accusations of lock breaking or of appearing at school under the influence of alcohol were racially motivated or even initiated by Principal O'Neill.  As for the evaluations, they could possibly be viewed by a jury as stemming from too rigorous a sense of management, order, and discipline, but there is no racial innuendo in O'Neill's extensive notations, discussions, and suggestions for improvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, plaintiff acknowledges all this in his motion for a new trial, where, in arguing that the court erred in excluding evidence of the subsequent in-house handling of sexual harassment claims against two white school employees, he argued:  \"The admission of this evidence would have provided the 'race' that the Court was looking for at Directed Verdict.\"   Unless the exclusion of this evidence was reversible error, the charges of racial discrimination must be held not to be supported by evidence sufficient to reach a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence proffered was that, six months after the complaints against plaintiff, two white Lewenberg School employees were accused of inappropriate sexual conduct involving female students.  (A custodian was accused of kissing a student, and a shop teacher was accused of telling a student, found hiding under a stairway, that she would have to \"kiss the teacher\" before she would be let out.)   In both instances, the complaints were handled without involving the police, through meetings with the students, the employees, a parent, and a guardian.  Plaintiff argues that O'Neill's failure to call in the police and to require signed statements, and his personal meeting with the students and parents contrasts sharply with what took place after the complaints were lodged against plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff faces the considerable hurdle of establishing an abuse of discretion by the district court in excluding the evidence.  That court's basic determination was that plaintiff had not carried his burden of showing that the white employee cases were \"similarly situated\" to that of plaintiff, in order to lay a basis for the admission of the evidence.  In the first place there is no evidence that there was any precise policy that mandated a specific course of action that in practice was applied differently to whites and blacks.  Certainly the manner in which O'Neill sought and followed guidance in following up on the complaints against plaintiff does not suggest any predisposition to treat plaintiff any differently from anyone else found in his predicament.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, most pertinently, a simultaneous complaint by three female students involving touching, suggestive remarks, and observation of other such conduct, together with unwanted telephone calls at home, would seem to involve a demonstrably different order of magnitude than the solitary charges against the two white employees.  See Perkins v. Brigham &amp; Women's Hosp., 78 F.3d 747, 751 (1st Cir.1996).  Moreover, there is no indication that any changes in approach had been invoked subsequent to the January complaints.  We conclude that the district court did not exceed its discretion in excluding the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Libel and Slander.   Plaintiff relies heavily on the four performance evaluations made by O'Neill to make out a jury case of defamation.  But these, as well as statements concerning plaintiff's breaking a lock and his \"erratic\" behavior, are subject to the qualified privilege of an employer or supervisor to monitor, discuss, and attempt to improve subordinates' performance.  Much of what plaintiff complains about was not contested.  Much was obviously the Principal's opinion as to what was good or bad educational practice.  But none of it could have been found to have been knowingly false or in reckless disregard of the truth.  Judd v. McCormack, 27 Mass.App.Ct. 167, 535 N.E.2d 1284, 1289 (1989) (reversing for failure to direct a verdict even though \"tasteless and harsh\" language was used);  Bratt v. International Business Machines Corp., 392 Mass. 508, 467 N.E.2d 126, 131-32 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.  Under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167; 11H, 11I, interference with rights of another \"by threats, intimidation or coercion\" gives rise to a cause of action.  These predicate words have been sternly construed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.  \"Threat\" involves an \"intentional exertion of pressure to make another fearful ... of injury or harm.\"  \"Intimidation\" involves \"putting in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct.\"   And \"coercion\" involves the \"application to another of such force, either physical or moral, as to constrain him to do against his will something he would not otherwise have done.\"  Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts v. Blake, 417 Mass. 467, 631 N.E.2d 985, 990 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the evidence remotely suggests pressures of these magnitudes being brought to bear on plaintiff.  Even his own selfserving testimony on cross examination that one of the complainants against him, April Allen, told him that O'Neill in talking with her twice said that he had seen plaintiff touching her, contrary to her own supposed belief, falls far short of indicating any such pressure on her which could forcefully impact on him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malicious Prosecution.   Plaintiff contends that he has fulfilled the two threshold requirements of malicious prosecution:  initiation of criminal proceedings with malice and without probable cause, and termination of such proceedings in his favor.  He fails on both counts.  First, there is no evidence of precisely how the criminal proceedings were initiated.  As the Massachusetts Appeals Court noted in Ziemba v. Fo'cs'le, Inc., 19 Mass.App.Ct. 484, 475 N.E.2d 1223, 1226 (1985), even the act of calling the police is not the equivalent of instituting criminal proceedings.  It may well be that such a decision was made by the police themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally important, the fact that the bench trial, unimpeached by any evidence of perjury by defendant O'Neill (who did not testify at either the show cause hearing or the bench trial), or of subornation of perjury, resulted in a judgment of guilty is a complete bar to the action.  Della Jacova v. Widett, 355 Mass. 266, 244 N.E.2d 580, 582 (1969).  It should not be necessary to add that plaintiff's testimony of an alleged statement by his accuser April Allen concerning O'Neill's supposed statements that he had seen plaintiff lay hands on her, may not be dignified as evidence of subornation of perjury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.   Again, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has sharply circumscribed the reach of this tort.  In Sena v. Commonwealth, 417 Mass. 250, 629 N.E.2d 986, 994 (1994) the court stated that to sustain a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must show 1) that the defendant intended to cause, or should have known that his conduct would cause, emotional distress;  2) that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous;  3) that the defendant's conduct caused the plaintiff's distress;  and 4) that the plaintiff suffered severe distress.  Id. (citing Agis v. Howard Johnson Co., 371 Mass. 140, 355 N.E.2d 315, 318 (1976).  The Agis court cited approvingly such language as \"beyond all possible bounds of decency\" and \"utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\"  355 N.E.2d at 319.   However one may view any of the actions attributable to Principal O'Neill, one could not fairly apply any of these rubrics to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidentiary Issues.   Of the three evidentiary issues argued by plaintiff, we have already disposed of one, the court's exclusion of the evidence concerning the handling of the sex harassment complaints against the two white employees.  A second involves the granting of defendant's motion in limine to exclude April Allen's statements about O'Neill's conversation with her.  But, as our above discussion reveals, the same testimony came in on the cross examination of plaintiff.  We see no need to revisit in any detail what was already exposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last claim is simply that the court excluded evidence that early in 1992 O'Neill called into his office the proffered witness, a former male student, and another who was accused of improper conduct and made them sign statements he had prepared.  Plaintiff sees this incident as evidence of O'Neill's modus operandi.  But O'Neill is not alleged to have engaged in any such conduct in this case;  his supposed statements to April Allen of what he said he saw are of an obviously different modus than calling a student into his office and forcing the signing of a previously prepared written statement.  The evidence would have little relevance, if any, but would have been freighted with prejudice.  The court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Defendants' Appeal:  Fees and Sanctions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Principal O'Neill and the School Committee appeal from the court's denial of their motions for sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1927 and for attorney's fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedural background is brief.  In their answers to the complaint, in early 1994, appellants invoked violation of Rule 11.  Nothing transpired on the sanctions front until April of 1995, when appellants sent counsel for Anderson a letter protesting the allegations and serving notice that, if trial were to take place, they would pursue their Rule 11 remedy.  The next event took place on February 27, 1996, shortly after the court had directed the verdicts, when appellants filed a new Rule 11 motion.  This, however, was filed without having waited for 21 days after service before filing, as required by &#167; c(1)(A) of the rule.  It was denied on March 15 and on March 18 an amended motion, with additional allegations, was served;  it was filed on April 16, 1996.  In mid-March motions were filed under &#167;&#167; 1927 and 1988.  All were denied by the court without hearing or comment in late March and early April.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants base their claims for sanctions on what they term unfounded and uninvestigated allegations of race discrimination on the part of O'Neill;  allegations of systemic underrepresentation of blacks in Lewenberg School and elsewhere, together with discriminatory policies and customs resulting from reckless indifference on the part of the city and the School Committee;  misleading and erroneous damages evidence on the part of Anderson;  and allegations of false accusations of alcohol and drug abuse, coercion of young female students, and perjury on the part of O'Neill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson merely presents the same facts in haec verba from his main brief, reargues that the district court was in error in directing the verdicts, contends that he had established prima facie cases on every count, and points out that he dismissed claims for disparate impact and municipal (Monell ) liability.  He cited no cases.  He dismisses appellants' motions as \"incomprehensible, not timely, violating every 'safe harbor' rule known, and, generally, ... a waste of everybody's time.\"The questions which this background presented to the court involved the procedural one of timeliness and undue delay of the various motions and the substantive ones whether reasonable inquiry was made by plaintiff's counsel, Ryan v. Clemente, 901 F.2d 177 (1st Cir.1990), and whether claims were unfounded or were so revealed as the case progressed.  The motions also implicitly involved the allocation of responsibility, if any existed, between plaintiff and his counsel.  The only question which faces us at this juncture, however, is whether we have enough basis to affirm, to modify, or to reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are therefore required to focus sharply on our own precedents in order to determine whether the district court in denying sanctions and fees in this case should have accompanied those decisions with some explanation.  We tread very carefully in this area, for the district court is entitled not only to the ordinary deference due the trial judge, and additional deference in the entire area of sanctions, but extraordinary deference in denying sanctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants make the broad argument, based on a blanket observation in Metrocorps, Inc. v. Eastern Mass.  Junior Drum &amp; Bugle Corps Ass'n., 912 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1990), that, whether or not sanctions are ordered or denied, reasons must be given, if meaningful review is to be had.  In Metrocorps, sanctions were sought because of a party's failure to comply with discovery requirements.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 37, however, specifies that sanctions may be avoided only if substantial justification is shown.  We held that \"[t]he clear language of the rule imposes a duty on the district court.\"  Id. at 2.   We also addressed the alternative ground for sanctions, Rule 11, and cited Morgan v. Massachusetts General Hospital, 901 F.2d 186, 195 (1st Cir.1990), which in turn cited Carlucci v. Piper Aircraft Corp., Inc., 775 F.2d 1440, 1446-47 (11th Cir.1985) for the general proposition that a district court must state reasons so that a meaningful review may be had.  We then went on to say, \"[i]f this is the district court's burden when sanctions are imposed, it follows naturally that a similar obligation exists where, as here, sanctions are requested by one party, but denied by the court.\"  901 F.2d at 195.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Carlucci itself not only addressed the unexplained positive imposition of sanctions, but a discovery sanction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37 limited to \"reasonable expenses caused by the failure\" to obey an order.  Understandably, the appellate court felt it needed some basis on which to review the reasonableness of the amount.  Moreover, in Morgan, where the hospital's motion for fees had been denied without reasons, we prefaced our analysis with the observation that \"From the record before us, we are unable to determine the basis of the district court's denial\" of the motion.  901 F.2d at 195.   We added that the fee decision \"must both be explained and be supported by the record.\"  Id.  These statements, of course, were sufficient to have justified our action in requiring reasons, without resort to the Carlucci blanket prescription.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, in the same year, in Figueroa-Ruiz v. Alegria, 905 F.2d 545, 549 (1st Cir.1990), we remanded a case in which Rule 11 sanctions had been denied, because we found the decision to be capable of bearing a number of meanings.  We added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>While we do not hold that the district court must make findings and give explanations every time a party seeks sanctions under Rule 11, we do require a statement when the reason for the decision is not obvious or apparent from the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We then cited, with a see, Morgan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then came Metrocorps, with no reference to Figueroa-Ruiz.   Finally, in Witty v. Dukakis, 3 F.3d 517 (1st Cir.1993), where the district court had, early on, denied a fee application under &#167; 1988 as untimely, and later denied without opinion two subsequent motions to revisit the issue, we said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>So long as a district court's reason for denying fees or monetary sanctions is (1) well founded, (2) sufficient to the stated end, and (3) apparent on the face of the record, a reviewing tribunal will not insist on unnecessary punctilio.  (Citing, among others, Figueroa-Ruiz and Morgan, but not Metrocorps.)  Id. at 521.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We observed that it was \"perfectly clear that the district court's thinking had not changed\" between the first and last two decisions.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From these precedents, we discern the continuing basic theme that although the rationale for a denial of a motion for fees or sanctions under Rule 11, &#167; 1927, or &#167; 1988 should be unambiguously communicated, the lack of explicit findings is not fatal where the record itself, evidence or colloquy, clearly indicates one or more sufficient supporting reasons.  The occasional statements referring to an inflexible requirement for explicit findings in every case do not reflect our present considered judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reflection reveals that appellate review of denials of such motions calls for somewhat more restraint than review of positive actions imposing sanctions and shifting fees.  In the latter event the decision of the trial court is a relatively rare and always deliberate event.  In the former event, motions are often perfunctorily made and generally denied.  To require in run-of-the-mill cases, where it is obvious that the conduct of a party and his attorney was within the bounds of reason, decency, and competence, that the trial court stop and frame specific findings would be to add irresponsibly to its already considerable burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, a number of factors coalesce to convince us of the need for help from the district court.  In the first place, we need its assessment of the weight of arguments as to untimeliness and undue delay in the pursuit of Rule 11 sanctions.  We are also unable to ascertain without such help whether \"reasonable inquiry\" was made of some of the charges levied by plaintiff.  Should available public records have indicated an absence of systemic recklessness and discrimination in the Boston school system?   Were the alleged victims (Allen and O'Connor) of plaintiff's advances interviewed?   Why were they, although present at the courthouse, not called as witnesses by plaintiff?   Similar questions are raised in our minds as to Stutman, the union representative, Philogene, who initiated the complaint of alcohol abuse, other teachers, police and the Department of Safety.  Were plaintiff's explanations concerning the missing tape consistent and credible?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, what weight should be given, if any, to prior court-administered warnings to counsel.  One was our own case, Cummings v. Hanson, 1995 WL 764363, 1995 U.S.App.Vol.LEXIS 36978 (December 1995), in which we affirmed sanctions against this plaintiff's attorney for bringing a claim in the wrong forum and cautioned him against repetition.  And although the Massachusetts Appeals Court decision in Doe v. Nutter, McClennen &amp; Fish, 41 Mass.App.Ct. 137, 668 N.E.2d 1329, 1331 (1996), affirming sanctions and awarding double costs against plaintiff's counsel in the instant case for a frivolous appeal, was issued subsequent to the actions of the district court below in denying sanctions, both a Massachusetts Superior Court justice and a single justice of the Massachusetts Appeals Court had previously imposed sanctions against plaintiff's attorney for filing suit against defendants although he was aware that he did not have a viable cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In raising these points, we do not profess to have an informed opinion.  Indeed, that is why we feel it necessary to remand the case so that the district court may review its decisions on the several motions for sanctions and fees, assess any responsibility as between plaintiff and counsel, and make known to us its reasons for the actions taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the appeal on the merits (No. 96-1443), the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fee appeal (No. 96-1578), we adopt the procedure of presently retaining jurisdiction and remanding to the district court for the limited purpose of revisiting the motions for sanctions and fees.

One is brought by plaintiff Eugene Anderson, a Boston public school teacher, contesting directed verdicts on all seven claims he brought against his then principal, Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr., and the Boston School Committee.  In the other, the defendants appeal from the district court's denial of sanctions and an attorney's fee award.  In the plaintiff's appeal, we affirm the judgment.  In the defendants' appeal, we deem this a case where we feel we need the reasoning of the district court and so remand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Plaintiff's Appeal:  The Merits</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this juncture, there are directed verdicts on seven counts which are contested by plaintiff<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>, as well as several evidentiary rulings.  The litigation resulted in over 100 docket entries from complaint to filing the notice of appeal and five days of jury trial, at the end of which the court granted defendants' motions for directed verdict.  We have meticulously reviewed both the transcript and the exhibits.  The smoke now dissipated, we are compelled to conclude that there is no longer any discernible fire.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In view of the fact that such ample opportunity was afforded below to pursue all avenues in support of the claims, we do not feel it incumbent on us to replay all of the evidence.  We shall content ourselves with a capsule summary of events and a brief consideration of the viability of each claim as of the end of the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Factual Background.   Plaintiff, a black person,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> had been a public school teacher for ten years when, in 1989, he drew an assignment as an art teacher to the Solomon Lewenberg Middle School in Mattapan, of which O'Neill was the principal.  There was an obvious miscommunication, for when plaintiff appeared, O'Neill felt that there was no vacancy because another teacher, Molloy, a white person, had already filled it.  He sent plaintiff back twice, but plaintiff finally was placed in the school, in addition to Molloy, and given an adequate room, only to be reassigned to a less satisfactory room shortly after.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  He also had trouble obtaining adequate art supplies.  Soon after arrival at the school, plaintiff was asked to attend an orientation meeting;  when he arrived, O'Neill accused him of breaking a lock at the art room.  In fact, plaintiff said, there was a door hinge without any lock on it.  Apparently there were no consequences to this incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later in September and in October, O'Neill visited two of plaintiff's art classes for 45 and 55 minutes and prepared evaluations of his teaching.  Plaintiff was criticized for his lesson planning, classroom management, and maintaining a learning environment, but was given satisfactory ratings for other factors such as use of materials, treatment of students, and professional cooperation Plaintiff responded vigorously to both evaluations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">O'Neill was on leave during the 1990-1991 school year during which time Anderson had one satisfactory evaluation by another superior.  In September of 1991, when O'Neill had returned, he summoned plaintiff to a formal hearing concerning an incident when Anderson appeared at school, allegedly with alcohol on his breath, detected by the assistant principal, Philogene, a black person, by another superior, Giacalone, and by others.  For this he was given a warning.  Later, in December of 1991 and January of 1992, O'Neill issued two more evaluations, giving many \"unsatisfactory\" ratings and noting that students in plaintiff's class were using foul language, playing cards, and reading comics.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on January 24, 1992, O'Neill was visited in his office by three black girl students who wanted to talk to him about Anderson's behavior.  Two of them complained that plaintiff had made sexual advances to them by touching them and by making inappropriate remarks.  The third stated that she had observed such conduct.  They also said that he had made unwanted telephone calls to them at home.  O'Neill then consulted with the office of the East Zone Superintendent of the Boston Public Schools, Clifford B. Janey, the city's General Counsel, and the Department of Safety.  Janey, a black person, in turn instructed O'Neill to conduct a full investigation.  This was undertaken, although there is no evidence detailing how it began, how the police were involved, or what steps were taken.  In early February, plaintiff was relieved of his duties and transferred pending hearing and resolution.  A criminal complaint was later filed after a show cause hearing.  A bench trial in the spring of 1993 resulted in a judgment of guilty, but later a jury trial in December resulted in a not guilty verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This suit was filed shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Racial discrimination.   We first consider the claims of racial discrimination, which are embraced by Counts I (42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983), II (42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq.), and IV (Mass.  Gen. Laws ch.  151B).  The striking fact about this case is that after all of the discovery and five days of trial, no evidence of either pretext or racially motivated discrimination was presented for jury consideration.  No conversations evidencing racial animus were presented, nor any instances of unexplained more favorable treatment of similarly situated whites.  There was no evidence that the accusations of lock breaking or of appearing at school under the influence of alcohol were racially motivated or even initiated by Principal O'Neill.  As for the evaluations, they could possibly be viewed by a jury as stemming from too rigorous a sense of management, order, and discipline, but there is no racial innuendo in O'Neill's extensive notations, discussions, and suggestions for improvement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, plaintiff acknowledges all this in his motion for a new trial, where, in arguing that the court erred in excluding evidence of the subsequent in-house handling of sexual harassment claims against two white school employees, he argued:  \"The admission of this evidence would have provided the 'race' that the Court was looking for at Directed Verdict.\"   Unless the exclusion of this evidence was reversible error, the charges of racial discrimination must be held not to be supported by evidence sufficient to reach a jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence proffered was that, six months after the complaints against plaintiff, two white Lewenberg School employees were accused of inappropriate sexual conduct involving female students.  (A custodian was accused of kissing a student, and a shop teacher was accused of telling a student, found hiding under a stairway, that she would have to \"kiss the teacher\" before she would be let out.)   In both instances, the complaints were handled without involving the police, through meetings with the students, the employees, a parent, and a guardian.  Plaintiff argues that O'Neill's failure to call in the police and to require signed statements, and his personal meeting with the students and parents contrasts sharply with what took place after the complaints were lodged against plaintiff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff faces the considerable hurdle of establishing an abuse of discretion by the district court in excluding the evidence.  That court's basic determination was that plaintiff had not carried his burden of showing that the white employee cases were \"similarly situated\" to that of plaintiff, in order to lay a basis for the admission of the evidence.  In the first place there is no evidence that there was any precise policy that mandated a specific course of action that in practice was applied differently to whites and blacks.  Certainly the manner in which O'Neill sought and followed guidance in following up on the complaints against plaintiff does not suggest any predisposition to treat plaintiff any differently from anyone else found in his predicament.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But, most pertinently, a simultaneous complaint by three female students involving touching, suggestive remarks, and observation of other such conduct, together with unwanted telephone calls at home, would seem to involve a demonstrably different order of magnitude than the solitary charges against the two white employees.  See Perkins v. Brigham &amp; Women's Hosp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"714796\"><a href=\"/opinion/714796/patrick-perkins-v-brigham-womens-hospital-and-george-h-kaye/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span>, 751 (1st Cir.1996).  Moreover, there is no indication that any changes in approach had been invoked subsequent to the January complaints.  We conclude that the district court did not exceed its discretion in excluding the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Libel and Slander.   Plaintiff relies heavily on the four performance evaluations made by O'Neill to make out a jury case of defamation.  But these, as well as statements concerning plaintiff's breaking a lock and his \"erratic\" behavior, are subject to the qualified privilege of an employer or supervisor to monitor, discuss, and attempt to improve subordinates' performance.  Much of what plaintiff complains about was not contested.  Much was obviously the Principal's opinion as to what was good or bad educational practice.  But none of it could have been found to have been knowingly false or in reckless disregard of the truth.  Judd v.

Under Mass.  Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167; 11H, 11I, interference with rights of another \"by threats, intimidation or coercion\" gives rise to a cause of action.  These predicate words have been sternly construed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.  \"Threat\" involves an \"intentional exertion of pressure to make another fearful ... of injury or harm.\"  \"Intimidation\" involves \"putting in fear for the purpose of compelling or deterring conduct.\"   And \"coercion\" involves the \"application to another of such force, either physical or moral, as to constrain him to do against his will something he would not otherwise have done.\"  Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts v.

Even his own selfserving testimony on cross examination that one of the complainants against him, April Allen, told him that O'Neill in talking with her twice said that he had seen plaintiff touching her, contrary to her own supposed belief, falls far short of indicating any such pressure on her which could forcefully impact on him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Malicious Prosecution.   Plaintiff contends that he has fulfilled the two threshold requirements of malicious prosecution:  initiation of criminal proceedings with malice and without probable cause, and termination of such proceedings in his favor.  He fails on both counts.  First, there is no evidence of precisely how the criminal proceedings were initiated.  As the Massachusetts Appeals Court noted in Ziemba v. Fo'cs'le, Inc., 19 Mass.App.Ct. 484, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2220420\"><a href=\"/opinion/2220420/ziemba-v-focsle-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span>, 1226 (1985), even the act of calling the police is not the equivalent of instituting criminal proceedings.  It may well be that such a decision was made by the police themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally important, the fact that the bench trial, unimpeached by any evidence of perjury by defendant O'Neill (who did not testify at either the show cause hearing or the bench trial), or of subornation of perjury, resulted in a judgment of guilty is a complete bar to the action.  Della Jacova v. Widett, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1996424\"><a href=\"/opinion/1996424/della-jacova-v-widett/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1996424\"><a href=\"/opinion/1996424/della-jacova-v-widett/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 582 (1969).  It should not be necessary to add that plaintiff's testimony of an alleged statement by his accuser April Allen concerning O'Neill's supposed statements that he had seen plaintiff lay hands on her, may not be dignified as evidence of subornation of perjury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress.   Again, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has sharply circumscribed the reach of this tort.  In Sena v. Commonwealth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2158440\"><a href=\"/opinion/2158440/sena-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2158440\"><a href=\"/opinion/2158440/sena-v-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></a></span>, 994 (1994) the court stated that to sustain a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, a plaintiff must show 1) that the defendant intended to cause, or should have known that his conduct would cause, emotional distress;  2) that the defendant's conduct was extreme and outrageous;  3) that the defendant's conduct caused the plaintiff's distress;  and 4) that the plaintiff suffered severe distress.

However one may view any of the actions attributable to Principal O'Neill, one could not fairly apply any of these rubrics to them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidentiary Issues.   Of the three evidentiary issues argued by plaintiff, we have already disposed of one, the court's exclusion of the evidence concerning the handling of the sex harassment complaints against the two white employees.  A second involves the granting of defendant's motion in limine to exclude April Allen's statements about O'Neill's conversation with her.  But, as our above discussion reveals, the same testimony came in on the cross examination of plaintiff.  We see no need to revisit in any detail what was already exposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The last claim is simply that the court excluded evidence that early in 1992 O'Neill called into his office the proffered witness, a former male student, and another who was accused of improper conduct and made them sign statements he had prepared.  Plaintiff sees this incident as evidence of O'Neill's modus operandi.  But O'Neill is not alleged to have engaged in any such conduct in this case;  his supposed statements to April Allen of what he said he saw are of an obviously different modus than calling a student into his office and forcing the signing of a previously prepared written statement.  The evidence would have little relevance, if any, but would have been freighted with prejudice.  The court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Defendants' Appeal:  Fees and Sanctions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Principal O'Neill and the School Committee appeal from the court's denial of their motions for sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11 and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1927 and for attorney's fees and costs under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The procedural background is brief.  In their answers to the complaint, in early 1994, appellants invoked violation of Rule 11.  Nothing transpired on the sanctions front until April of 1995, when appellants sent counsel for Anderson a letter protesting the allegations and serving notice that, if trial were to take place, they would pursue their Rule 11 remedy.  The next event took place on February 27, 1996, shortly after the court had directed the verdicts, when appellants filed a new Rule 11 motion.  This, however, was filed without having waited for 21 days after service before filing, as required by &#167; c(1)(A) of the rule.  It was denied on March 15 and on March 18 an amended motion, with additional allegations, was served;  it was filed on April 16, 1996.  In mid-March motions were filed under &#167;&#167; 1927 and 1988.  All were denied by the court without hearing or comment in late March and early April.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants base their claims for sanctions on what they term unfounded and uninvestigated allegations of race discrimination on the part of O'Neill;  allegations of systemic underrepresentation of blacks in Lewenberg School and elsewhere, together with discriminatory policies and customs resulting from reckless indifference on the part of the city and the School Committee;  misleading and erroneous damages evidence on the part of Anderson;  and allegations of false accusations of alcohol and drug abuse, coercion of young female students, and perjury on the part of O'Neill.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson merely presents the same facts in haec verba from his main brief, reargues that the district court was in error in directing the verdicts, contends that he had established prima facie cases on every count, and points out that he dismissed claims for disparate impact and municipal (Monell ) liability.  He cited no cases.  He dismisses appellants' motions as \"incomprehensible, not timely, violating every 'safe harbor' rule known, and, generally, ... a waste of everybody's time.\"The questions which this background presented to the court involved the procedural one of timeliness and undue delay of the various motions and the substantive ones whether reasonable inquiry was made by plaintiff's counsel, Ryan v. Clemente, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540003\"><a href=\"/opinion/540003/edward-f-ryan-v-gerald-w-clemente/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">177</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1990), and whether claims were unfounded or were so revealed as the case progressed.  The motions also implicitly involved the allocation of responsibility, if any existed, between plaintiff and his counsel.  The only question which faces us at this juncture, however, is whether we have enough basis to affirm, to modify, or to reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are therefore required to focus sharply on our own precedents in order to determine whether the district court in denying sanctions and fees in this case should have accompanied those decisions with some explanation.  We tread very carefully in this area, for the district court is entitled not only to the ordinary deference due the trial judge, and additional deference in the entire area of sanctions, but extraordinary deference in denying sanctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants make the broad argument, based on a blanket observation in Metrocorps, Inc. v. Eastern Mass.  Junior Drum &amp; Bugle Corps Ass'n., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"546979\"><a href=\"/opinion/546979/metrocorps-inc-v-the-eastern-massachusetts-junior-drum-bugle-corps/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1990), that, whether or not sanctions are ordered or denied, reasons must be given, if meaningful review is to be had.  In Metrocorps, sanctions were sought because of a party's failure to comply with discovery requirements.  Fed.R.Civ.P. 37, however, specifies that sanctions may be avoided only if substantial justification is shown.  We held that \"[t]he clear language of the rule imposes a duty on the district court.\"  Id. at 2.   We also addressed the alternative ground for sanctions, Rule 11, and cited Morgan v. Massachusetts General Hospital, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540006\"><a href=\"/opinion/540006/john-e-morgan-v-massachusetts-general-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir.1990), which in turn cited Carlucci v. Piper Aircraft Corp., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460208\"><a href=\"/opinion/460208/clara-carlucci-individually-and-as-special-administrator-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1440</span></a></span>, 1446-47 (11th Cir.1985) for the general proposition that a district court must state reasons so that a meaningful review may be had.  We then went on to say, \"[i]f this is the district court's burden when sanctions are imposed, it follows naturally that a similar obligation exists where, as here, sanctions are requested by one party, but denied by the court.\"  901 F.2d at 195.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Carlucci itself not only addressed the unexplained positive imposition of sanctions, but a discovery sanction under Fed.R.Civ.P. 37 limited to \"reasonable expenses caused by the failure\" to obey an order.  Understandably, the appellate court felt it needed some basis on which to review the reasonableness of the amount.  Moreover, in Morgan, where the hospital's motion for fees had been denied without reasons, we prefaced our analysis with the observation that \"From the record before us, we are unable to determine the basis of the district court's denial\" of the motion.  901 F.2d at 195.   We added that the fee decision \"must both be explained and be supported by the record.\"  Id.  These statements, of course, were sufficient to have justified our action in requiring reasons, without resort to the Carlucci blanket prescription.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, in the same year, in Figueroa-Ruiz v. Alegria, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543069\"><a href=\"/opinion/543069/rafael-figueroa-ruiz-v-jose-e-alegria-appeal-of-rafael-perez-bachs/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span>, 549 (1st Cir.1990), we remanded a case in which Rule 11 sanctions had been denied, because we found the decision to be capable of bearing a number of meanings.  We added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p>While we do not hold that the district court must make findings and give explanations every time a party seeks sanctions under Rule 11, we do require a statement when the reason for the decision is not obvious or apparent from the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We then cited, with a see, Morgan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Then came Metrocorps, with no reference to Figueroa-Ruiz.   Finally, in Witty v. Dukakis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194903\"><a href=\"/opinion/194903/witty-v-dukakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1993), where the district court had, early on, denied a fee application under &#167; 1988 as untimely, and later denied without opinion two subsequent motions to revisit the issue, we said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p>So long as a district court's reason for denying fees or monetary sanctions is (1) well founded, (2) sufficient to the stated end, and (3) apparent on the face of the record, a reviewing tribunal will not insist on unnecessary punctilio.  (Citing, among others, Figueroa-Ruiz and Morgan, but not Metrocorps.)  Id. at 521.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We observed that it was \"perfectly clear that the district court's thinking had not changed\" between the first and last two decisions.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From these precedents, we discern the continuing basic theme that although the rationale for a denial of a motion for fees or sanctions under Rule 11, &#167; 1927, or &#167; 1988 should be unambiguously communicated, the lack of explicit findings is not fatal where the record itself, evidence or colloquy, clearly indicates one or more sufficient supporting reasons.  The occasional statements referring to an inflexible requirement for explicit findings in every case do not reflect our present considered judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reflection reveals that appellate review of denials of such motions calls for somewhat more restraint than review of positive actions imposing sanctions and shifting fees.  In the latter event the decision of the trial court is a relatively rare and always deliberate event.  In the former event, motions are often perfunctorily made and generally denied.  To require in run-of-the-mill cases, where it is obvious that the conduct of a party and his attorney was within the bounds of reason, decency, and competence, that the trial court stop and frame specific findings would be to add irresponsibly to its already considerable burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, however, a number of factors coalesce to convince us of the need for help from the district court.  In the first place, we need its assessment of the weight of arguments as to untimeliness and undue delay in the pursuit of Rule 11 sanctions.  We are also unable to ascertain without such help whether \"reasonable inquiry\" was made of some of the charges levied by plaintiff.  Should available public records have indicated an absence of systemic recklessness and discrimination in the Boston school system?   Were the alleged victims (Allen and O'Connor) of plaintiff's advances interviewed?   Why were they, although present at the courthouse, not called as witnesses by plaintiff?   Similar questions are raised in our minds as to Stutman, the union representative, Philogene, who initiated the complaint of alcohol abuse, other teachers, police and the Department of Safety.  Were plaintiff's explanations concerning the missing tape consistent and credible?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, what weight should be given, if any, to prior court-administered warnings to counsel.  One was our own case, Cummings v. Hanson, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1995</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">764363</span></span>, 1995 U.S.App.Vol.LEXIS 36978 (December 1995), in which we affirmed sanctions against this plaintiff's attorney for bringing a claim in the wrong forum and cautioned him against repetition.  And although the Massachusetts Appeals Court decision in Doe v. Nutter, McClennen &amp; Fish, 41 Mass.App.Ct. 137, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1329</span></span>, 1331 (1996), affirming sanctions and awarding double costs against plaintiff's counsel in the instant case for a frivolous appeal, was issued subsequent to the actions of the district court below in denying sanctions, both a Massachusetts Superior Court justice and a single justice of the Massachusetts Appeals Court had previously imposed sanctions against plaintiff's attorney for filing suit against defendants although he was aware that he did not have a viable cause of action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In raising these points, we do not profess to have an informed opinion.  Indeed, that is why we feel it necessary to remand the case so that the district court may review its decisions on the several motions for sanctions and fees, assess any responsibility as between plaintiff and counsel, and make known to us its reasons for the actions taken.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the appeal on the merits (No. 96-1443), the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the fee appeal (No. 96-1578), we adopt the procedure of presently retaining jurisdiction and remanding to the district court for the limited purpose of revisiting the motions for sanctions and fees.  Cf. United States v. Quinones, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672030\"><a href=\"/opinion/672030/united-states-v-jesus-m-quinones-aka-jesus-m-quinones-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 219 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court may either (a) vacate the judgment and conduct such proceedings as it deems necessary to reach a final conclusion or (b) reaffirm the judgment previously imposed, filing with the clerk of the district court its written rationale.
