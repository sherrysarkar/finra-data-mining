Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                            Before\n\n                   Selya, Boudin and Lynch,\n                       Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     James R. Knudsen and Whittenberg & Associates on brief for\nappellant.\n     Donald K. Stern, United States Attorney, and Heidi E.\nBrieger, Assistant U.S. Attorney, on Motion for Summary\nDisposition for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         May 14, 2001\n\f           Per Curiam.      Kyle Minton appeals from his 74-month\n\nsentence imposed following a guilty plea to possession and\n\ndistribution of cocaine base.             Minton’s sole argument on\n\nappeal is that the district court erred in applying the\n\nenhancement      for   crack     cocaine     under     the     Sentencing\n\nGuidelines.   Specifically, Minton argues that the government\n\nproved only that the substance at issue was “cocaine base,”\n\nbut failed to prove that it was “crack,” the only form of\n\ncocaine base to which the sentencing enhancement applies. We\n\nremanded   for    further      findings    and,   if    necessary,      an\n\nevidentiary hearing regarding the type of drugs that Minton\n\npossessed and sold.\n\n           On remand, the district court held an evidentiary\n\nhearing on April 2, 2001, to determine, in the court’s\n\nwords, “whether the substance at issue was the crack form of\n\ncocaine base or some other form of cocaine base.”                At that\n\nhearing, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Special Agent\n\nDavid O’Neill testified. Id., p. 4.            After being found by\n\nthe district court to be fully qualified to testify on the\n\nsubject,   Special     Agent   O’Neill     testified    that    the   drug\n\nsubstance seized was “lumpy and rocky with an off-white\n\ncolor, all characteristics which indicated to him that it\n\nwas crack cocaine.”       Subsequent laboratory tests confirmed\n\nthat “the active drug ingredient is cocaine base.”\n\f          Recent opinions of this court have clarified the\n\n“cocaine base/crack distinction in the sentencing context.”\n\nUnited States v. Richardson, 225 F.3d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n               Both the statute and the Guidelines\n          impose significantly greater penalties\n          for   distributing   (or    manufacturing,\n          dispensing, or possessing with intent to\n          manufacture, distribute, or dispense) a\n          given quantity of “cocaine base” rather\n          than an equivalent quantity of “cocaine”\n          (i.e., cocaine hydrochloride or powder\n          cocaine).        See     21     U.S.C.    §\n          841(b)(1)(A)(ii),   (iii);     U.S.S.G.   §\n          2D1.1(c).   Neither the statute nor the\n          drug-quantity table in the Guidelines\n          that establishes the offense level uses\n          the word “crack.”    Section 841(b) does\n          not define “cocaine base,” but we have\n          held that the term, as used in the\n          statute, includes all forms of cocaine\n          base, including but not limited to\n          crack. See United States v. Lopez-Gil,\n          965 F.2d 1124, 1134 (1st Cir. 1992)\n          (opinion on panel rehearing).      As used\n          in the Guidelines, however, “cocaine\n          base” has, since a 1993 amendment, a\n          narrower meaning: “‘Cocaine base,’ for\n          the purposes of this guideline, means\n          ‘crack.’ ‘Crack is the street name for\n          a form of cocaine base, usually prepared\n          by processing cocaine hydrochloride and\n          sodium    bicarbonate,      and     usually\n          appearing in a lumpy, rocklike form.”\n          U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1 Node (D).              For\n          Guidelines purposes, then, forms of\n          cocaine base other than crack are\n          treated as cocaine. See U.S.S.G. App. C,\n          Amend. 487 (1993).\n\nId.\n\n          Therefore,   proof   that   a   substance   meets   the\n\nchemical definition of cocaine base does not suffice to\n\nprove that the guideline definition of cocaine base (i.e.,\n\ncrack) applies.   “Chemical analysis cannot distinguish crack\n\n                               -3-\n\ffrom any other form of cocaine base because crack and all\n\nother forms of cocaine base are identical at the molecular\n\nlevel. . . . Crack can be differentiated from other cocaine\n\nbases only by appearance and texture.” United States v.\n\nRobinson, 144 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1998).                     However, once\n\nthe   government       has    proven     by    chemical     analysis    that   a\n\nsubstance is cocaine base, lay opinion testimony may suffice\n\nto prove that it is crack. Richardson, 225 F.3d at 50.\n\n            Based upon Special Agent O’Neill’s sworn testimony,\n\nDEA reports, and Minton’s answers to questions posed to him\n\nby the court at his change-of-plea hearing, the district\n\ncourt found that “the government has satisfied its burden of\n\nproving,    by   a     preponderance          of   the   evidence,    that   the\n\nsubstance at issue was the crack form of cocaine base.”\n\n            In our order remanding this case, we permitted the\n\nparties to file supplemental briefs within twenty days of\n\nthe filing of the district court’s supplemental report.\n\nThat document was received by this court on April 6, 2001.\n\nNeither    party     has     filed   a   supplemental       brief.      In   all\n\nevents, it is readily apparent that the district court’s\n\nfinding    survives        clear-error         review.      Once     scientific\n\nevidence established that the substance was cocaine base,\n\n“competent       lay     testimony,       remarking        the     substance’s\n\ndistinctive appearance and texture and identifying it as\n\ncrack, forged the final link in the evidentiary chain.”\n\nUnited States v. Martinez, 144 F.3d 189, 190 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n            The sentence is affirmed.\n\f                                   By the Court:\n                                   PHOEBE MORSE, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n                                   By:\n                                     Chief Deputy Clerk\n\n\n                        -4-\n\n\n\n[cc: Heidi E.
