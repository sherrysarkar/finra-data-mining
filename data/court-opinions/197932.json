Arnold I. Friedman was convicted\r\nof defrauding several federally insured banks and ordered at\r\nsentencing to pay restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance\r\nCorporation (FDIC), the victim of his offenses.  Before sentencing,\r\nthe district court granted the government's ex parte order to seize\r\nthe net proceeds of the sale of his family's oceanfront condominium\r\nto satisfy any court-imposed penalties.  The government appeals an\r\norder by the district court allowing Unisource Worldwide, Inc.\r\n(Unisource), a creditor of defendant's business who had a guarantee\r\nfrom defendant's wife backed up by her interest in the condominium,\r\nto be paid from proceeds of the sale, as the holder of an interest\r\nin the nature of an equitable lien against the condominium.\r\nThe government argues that this decision exceeded the\r\ndistrict court's authority under the Victim Witness Protection Act\r\n(VWPA), 18 U.S.C.  3663-64, because Unisource was not the victim\r\nof defendant's offenses.  The government also argues that affirming\r\nthe judge's order would risk transforming sentencing proceedings\r\ninto equitable bankruptcy-style proceedings, thus frustrating\r\nCongress' basic intent to provide restitution for victims.  The\r\ngovernment's concerns, if they were actually raised by the facts of\r\nthis case, would present difficult questions under the VWPA.\r\nWe believe that, given the particular facts of this case,\r\naffirming the district court's order does not present the dangers\r\nthe government fears because we do not agree that the district\r\ncourt's order releasing funds to Unisource was an order of\r\n\"restitution\" to Unisource under the VWPA.  Rather, we regard the\r\norder as an implementation, permissible given the particular\r\ncircumstances, of the district court's earlier orders affecting\r\ndefendant's property.  We affirm.\r\n                           I.  On October 8, 1996, Arnold I. Friedman pled guilty to\r\ncharges of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1344 and of\r\nmaking false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C.  1014.  The\r\ncharges stemmed from check-kiting schemes in which Friedman\r\ndefrauded several federally insured banks.  The government, seeking\r\nto ensure that Friedman's assets would be available to satisfy any\r\ncourt-imposed penalties, filed an ex parte motion under Fed. R.\r\nCrim. Pro. 45(d) requesting an order pursuant to the All Writs Act,\r\n28 U.S.C.  1651, that would temporarily restrain Friedman from\r\ntransferring any assets.  On March 14, 1997, the district court\r\nissued this order, requiring Friedman \"to cease all transfers of\r\nassets and funds\" and directing that \"institutions and individuals\r\nwho hold any assets or funds in which Arnold I. Friedman holds an\r\nownership interest shall not transfer any such fund or assets until\r\nfurther order of this Court.\"\r\nOne asset that belonged to members of the Friedman family\r\nat this time was a condominium located in Swamscott, Massachusetts. \r\nThe owner of the condominium was the Cupid Ocean Front Realty\r\nTrust; the trustee was Kim Friedman, Arnold Friedman's adult\r\ndaughter, and the sole beneficiary was Leslie Friedman, Arnold\r\nFriedman's wife.  At the time of the court's March order, the\r\ncondominium had been appraised at approximately $609,000.  On\r\npaper, Arnold Friedman had no interest in the trust or the\r\ncondominium.  However, the government contended that Friedman in\r\nfact controlled the asset and that it should be attributed to him,\r\nnoting that he had lived in the condominium since its purchase in\r\n1993 and that he listed the condominium as an asset belonging to\r\nhim in a February 1997 mortgage application.  Arnold Friedman\r\nacknowledges that, although his position was that the condominium\r\nbelonged to his wife through a valid real estate trust, a court\r\nmight conclude that he controlled the condominium.\r\nFriedman had disclosed the existence of the condominium\r\nand the trust to the government at a presentence interview. \r\nFriedman's lawyer advised him that, because the district court's\r\nMarch order only covered assets in which he had an ownership\r\ninterest, the family was free to put the condominium up for sale. \r\nThe condominium was listed with a broker. After a few months, the\r\nfamily received an offer of approximately $950,000 for the\r\ncondominium.  The closing date was June 26, 1997.\r\nAccording to Friedman's lawyer, after the government\r\nlearned of the impending sale of the condominium, there was a\r\nmeeting between Arnold Friedman, his lawyer and officials of the\r\nProbation Department and the United States Attorney's Bank Fraud\r\nTask Force.  At that meeting, Friedman's lawyer claimed, the\r\ngovernment agreed to permit the sale of the condominium as long as\r\n$250,000 from the proceeds of the sale were put in escrow to be\r\navailable at sentencing if the court ruled that the condominium\r\nbelonged to Arnold Friedman.  The government disputes that such an\r\nagreement ever existed, but does not dispute that such a meeting\r\ntook place.\r\nIn any event, the government never sought to stop the\r\nsale of the condominium on the ground that the sale would violate\r\nthe court's March order.  Rather, on June 25, 1997, the day before\r\nclosing, the government requested an ex parte order, again pursuant\r\nto the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.  1651, directing the United States\r\nMarshals to seize the net proceeds of the sale.  Friedman contends\r\nthat the government's action in seeking the order violated the\r\nearlier agreement, and suggests that the order was sought by a\r\ndifferent set of government attorneys than those that were present\r\nat the meeting.  The court granted the ex parte order.\r\nThe order required \"all proceeds, (after all secured\r\nclaims, liens and other costs associated with the real estate\r\nclosing are paid) generated by the . . . sale of the condominium\r\n. . . [to] be turned over to the United States Marshals Service\r\n. . . .\"  The order also directed the U.S. Marshals to hold the\r\nfunds \"until further order of the Court . . . .\"\r\nPursuant to this order, the following day the U.S.\r\nMarshals seized the proceeds of the sale of the condominium at the\r\nclosing.  The U.S. Marshals obtained a check for $342,899, which\r\nrepresented the sale price of the condominium ($954,617), less the\r\namount of a mortgage loan ($445,935), another loan ($125,687),\r\nsettlement costs, including attorney's fees, title insurance,\r\nbroker's commission, etc. ($31,421), and taxes and utility fees to\r\nthe Town of Swamscott ($8950).\r\nAs a result of the seizure, one creditor was not paid who\r\nhad expected to be paid from the proceeds of the sale.  That\r\ncreditor, Unisource, was a supplier of Aim Chemical Enterprises, a\r\nbusiness which Arnold and Leslie Friedman owned and operated\r\njointly.  Under a credit arrangement with Unisource, Leslie\r\nFriedman had issued a personal guarantee of Aim Chemical's debts to\r\nUnisource, a guarantee that specifically included the condominium. \r\nAim Chemical had difficulty paying its bills, and Aim Chemical and\r\nUnisource worked out a payment plan. In early 1997, Aim Chemical\r\ndefaulted on this payment plan, and Unisource indicated that it\r\nwould take legal action to collect.\r\nAt that time, Leslie Friedman asked Unisource not to\r\nattach the Swamscott property through formal legal proceedings\r\nbecause she believed it would have a chilling effect on the\r\nimpending sale.  Unisource agreed to forbear from filing a formal\r\nattachment, but only after receiving Leslie Friedman's written\r\nguarantee, through her attorney, that it would be paid \"[f]rom the\r\nproceeds of the sale of the property\" an amount \"equal to any\r\namounts due and owning [sic] and outstanding for more than thirty\r\n(30) days prior to the closing date . . . .\"  The agreement stated\r\nthat, \"[s]imultaneously with the closing,\" this amount would be\r\ndelivered to Unisource in a check.  That amount, $85,773, was not\r\npaid to Unisource at the closing, as Unisource and Mrs. Friedman\r\nhad agreed, and those funds were instead seized by the U.S.\r\nMarshals.\r\nThe day after closing, June 27, 1997, Unisource filed a\r\npleading styled \"Motion of Unisource Worldwide, Inc. to Intervene\r\nfor a Limited Purpose,\" purportedly pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\r\n24(a)(2).  The motion requested that the district court \"permit[]\r\nUnisource to be paid from the proceeds of the sale as if it had\r\nperfected its lien,\" arguing that its forbearance had benefitted\r\nall parties, including the government, by facilitating a sale that\r\nmight have been discouraged if Unisource had sought to attach the\r\ncondominium through formal legal proceedings.  Unisource argued\r\nthat its interest was sufficiently definite to come within the\r\nterms of the district court's June order directing that all\r\n\"secured claims, liens and other costs associated with the real\r\nestate closing\" should be paid from the proceeds of the sale prior\r\nto the seizure by the U.S. Marshals of the balance.\r\nAt a sentencing hearing on July 30, 1997, the district\r\ncourt heard arguments on the condominium issue.  The defendant\r\nargued that the property belonged to his wife, as beneficiary of\r\nthe real estate trust, although he acknowledged that his control of\r\nthat asset rendered the issue close.  The defendant also urged the\r\ncourt to permit Unisource to be paid, arguing that it was necessary\r\nfor Aim Chemical's continued viability that its creditors be paid\r\nand that Aim Chemical's continued profitability would ensure his\r\nability to pay the district court's restitution order.  \r\nThe government argued that the condominium did belong to\r\nFriedman.  The government also argued that Unisource was an\r\nunsecured creditor, and that its interest was therefore not covered\r\nby the June order.  Finally, the government argued that the\r\ndistrict court could not release any funds to Unisource because it\r\nwas not a victim of the defendant's crimes, and that the district\r\ncourt lacked authority under the VWPA to do anything but order\r\nrestitution to the victim.\r\nAlthough the district court never acted on Unisource's\r\nmotion to intervene, it permitted counsel for Unisource to address\r\nthe court during the sentencing hearing.  Unisource argued that its\r\ninterest in the proceeds of the sale under the letter agreement was\r\nprotected by the district court's June order, and that it should be\r\npaid from the proceeds as the holder of an equitable lien to remedy\r\nthe improper seizure of its share.\r\nThe district court accepted this argument.  It ordered\r\nrestitution to the FDIC in the amount of $1,000,000, and further\r\ndirected in its amended criminal judgment that \"monies seized by\r\nthe government will be released to probation officer to be\r\ndistributed to creditor Unisource (not the victim of the instant\r\noffense) and victim FDIC.\"  The government filed numerous motions\r\nseeking reconsideration of the order permitting Unisource to be\r\npaid, each of which was denied.  \r\nThe government then filed this appeal.  In effect, the\r\ngovernment now wants the $85,773 (which both Friedman and Unisource\r\nsay belongs to Unisource) to apply against Friedman's one million\r\ndollar restitution obligation, thus lowering the risk that the full\r\nsum of restitution will not be collected over time.\r\n                         II.\r\nThis appeal involves only the narrow issue of whether the\r\ndistrict court had authority to permit Unisource to be paid from\r\nthe proceeds of the sale.  The government argues that the district\r\ncourt did not.  Friedman did not file a cross-appeal challenging\r\nthe district court's implicit determination that an interest in the\r\ncondominium could be attributed to him, and that issue is therefore\r\nnot before us.\r\nThe government argues that the district court's order\r\npermitting Unisource to be paid from the proceeds of the sale\r\nexceeded the district court's authority under the VWPA, 18 U.S.C.\r\n3663-64.  The government argues that the district court order\r\npermitting Unisource to be paid was an order of \"restitution,\" and\r\nthat, under the VWPA, \"restitution may be awarded only to a 'victim\r\nof the offense.'\"  United States v. Gibbens, 25 F.3d 28, 33 (1st\r\nCir. 1994) (quoting 18 U.S.C.  3663(b)(1)).\r\nWe have no quarrel with the government's position that\r\norders of restitution under the VWPA can only be awarded to the\r\nvictim of a defendant's offense, and that ordinary creditors of a\r\ndefendant may not entitle themselves to consideration for\r\nrestitution by intervening at a sentencing hearing.  However, we\r\nthink the government's characterization of what occurred in the\r\ndistrict court misses the mark.  Although the district court's\r\norder permitting Unisource to be paid is memorialized in a portion\r\nof the amended criminal judgment labeled \"restitution and\r\nforfeiture,\" the sentencing hearing makes clear that the district\r\ncourt did not consider its order as an order requiring Friedman to\r\npay restitution to Unisource under the VWPA.  Instead, the district\r\ncourt accepted Unisource's argument that it had an equitable lien\r\nor other definite interest that was protected by the court's June\r\norder which had directed the U.S. Marshals to seize only the net\r\nsale proceeds of the condominium.  \r\nThus, the district court never considered its authority\r\nto release funds to Unisouce from the seizure as stemming from the\r\nVWPA directly; rather, its authority derived from its inherent\r\nauthority to issue all writs necessary in aid of its jurisdiction\r\nunder the All Writs Act, 18 U.S.C.  1651, authority which\r\ncertainly includes the power to issue a subsequent order which is\r\nneeded to implement an earlier order which the district court had\r\nauthority to issue.  Therefore, if the district court had authority\r\nto release funds to Unisource, it stems from its authority to\r\nimplement its earlier June order, obtained ex parte at the\r\ngovernment's request, to seize the net proceeds of the condominium\r\nsale.  The order, by its terms, excluded \"all secured claims, liens\r\nand other costs associated with the real estate closing . . . .\" \r\nWe note that this language came from the government's ex parte\r\nmotion.\r\nIf the district court did not err in its interpretation\r\nof its own earlier June order, its decision to release funds to\r\nUnisource can be sustained as within the district court's authority\r\nunder 28 U.S.C.  1651.  The government does not contend that the\r\ndistrict court's June order, obtained ex parte at the government's\r\nrequest, violated the VWPA because it permitted \"secured claims,\r\nliens and other costs associated with the real estate closing\" to\r\nbe satisfied before the seizure of the balance of the proceeds for\r\nthe ultimate purpose of providing restitution to victims.  Indeed,\r\nthe government proposed that language.  Nor does the government\r\ncontend that the district court lacked authority to correct a\r\nmistake in the implementation of its June order.  The district\r\ncourt plainly could have required, for example, that the U.S.\r\nMarshals release funds to a holder of a mortgage interest in the\r\nproperty whose interest had been mistakenly seized at the real\r\nestate closing, despite the fact that such a person, like\r\nUnisource, would not have been a victim of the offense under the\r\nVWPA.\r\nInstead, the government contends that the district\r\ncourt's order protected only secured creditors and that Unisource,\r\nwhich had not filed a formal attachment, was not secured.  The\r\ngovernment also argues that, because Unisource was in its view\r\nmerely an ordinary, unsecured trade creditor, affirming the\r\ndistrict court's actions would risk transforming sentencing\r\nproceedings into equitable bankruptcy-style proceedings in which\r\nvarious creditors of the defendant would be permitted to make\r\nclaims against the defendant's property.  This, argues the\r\ngovernment, would frustrate Congress' intent that the award of\r\nrestitution to victims of crime should be the primary focus of\r\nsentencing proceedings, and that victims' claims should take\r\npriority over those of many other creditors.  See 18 U.S.C. \r\n3613(c) (giving liens created by orders of restitution the same\r\nstatus as tax liens).\r\nWe do not agree that affirming the district court's\r\nactions presents such a danger given the particular circumstances\r\nof this case.  First, the government's argument assumes that\r\nUnisource was an ordinary trade creditor, and we believe that the\r\nrecord does not support this contention.  Under Massachusetts law,\r\nan equitable lien is defined as \"a charge upon specific property,\r\nentitling the holder of the lien to have the property applied in\r\nequity to the payment of his debt as against all other claimants of\r\nthe property except purchasers for value without notice.\" \r\nBallentine v. Eaton, 8 N.E.2d 808, 809 (Mass. 1937).  In\r\nMassachusetts, an equitable lien may arise from the express\r\nagreement of a debtor to pay a creditor out of a specific fund or\r\nproperty.  See Check v. Kaplan, 182 N.E. 305, 306 (Mass. 1932)\r\n(\"[A]s between the parties a right in the nature of a lien on an\r\nidentified and particular fund may be created [by express\r\nagreement] which will in appropriate circumstances by enforced in\r\nequity\"); Delval v. Gagnon, 99 N.E. 1095 (Mass. 1912); Pinch v.\r\nAnthony, 90 Mass. (8 Allen) 536, 539 (1864) (\"The rule is perfectly\r\nwell settled, that a party may by express agreement create a charge\r\nor claim in the nature of a lien on real as well as personal estate\r\nof which he is the owner or possessor, and that equity will\r\nestablish and enforce such a claim . . . .\").  A leading legal\r\ndictionary defines the term \"equitable lien\" as follows:\r\nA right, not existing at law, to have specific\r\nproperty applied in whole or in part to\r\npayment of a particular debt or class of\r\ndebts.  An equitable lien arises either from a\r\nwritten contract which shows an intention to\r\ncharge some particular property with a debt or\r\nobligation or is implied and declared by a\r\ncourt of equity out of general considerations\r\nof right and justice as applied to relations\r\nof the parties and circumstances of their\r\ndealings.\r\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary 539 (6th ed. 1990) (citations omitted).\r\nGiven these legal principles, Unisource was no ordinary\r\nunsecured trade creditor seeking to satisfy a debt, as the\r\ngovernment contends.  Rather, it had earlier arranged a payment\r\nplan with the Friedman business that included a personal guarantee\r\nof its debts from Leslie Friedman, a guarantee that specifically\r\nincluded the condominium at issue.  After the Friedman business had\r\nagain become delinquent in its payments under the payment plan,\r\nUnisource announced its intention to initiate proceedings to\r\nformally attach the condominium.  Only after receiving a written\r\npromise that its debt would be satisfied from the proceeds of the\r\nimpending sale did Unisource forbear from seeking the attachment. \r\nUnisource's forbearance benefitted all parties by facilitating the\r\nsale.  This, in turn, provided the victim FDIC with substantial\r\nmonetary restitution that might well have been reduced if the\r\nproperty had not been sold at the time, but sold later at auction,\r\nquite probably at a lower price.\r\n Under these circumstances, it was not clearly erroneous\r\nfor the district court to conclude that Unisource held an equitable\r\nlien under Massachusetts law arising from the April agreement.  SeeCheck, 182 N.E. at 173 (regarding the existence of an equitable\r\nlien arising from the parties' express agreement as \"a pure\r\nquestion of fact upon which the decision of the trial judge must\r\nstand\").  Moreover, even if the interest was not definite enough to\r\nrise to the level of a lien under Massachusetts law, the June order\r\ndid not protect only lienholders.  Rather, it also protected other\r\nthird parties who expected to be paid from the proceeds of the\r\ncondominium sale, such as the attorneys and brokers, none of whom\r\nnecessarily had a secured interest in the property.  The district\r\ncourt was thus within its discretion to interpret its own June\r\norder as protecting Unisource's interest in these circumstances. \r\nAlthough Unisource's claim was not specifically mentioned as among\r\nthose interests that would be satisfied prior to seizure of the\r\nbalance, this is explained by the fact that the order was obtained\r\nex parte at the government's request without notice to Friedman or\r\npotential creditors.  Under such circumstances, the district court\r\ndid not err by interpreting its earlier order as including\r\nUnisource as among those claimants it intended to protect.\r\nWe emphasize the narrowness of our decision.  It was the\r\ngovernment which asked for the June order to be drafted in a manner\r\nthat permitted the sale to take place and which protected the\r\ninterests of those third parties who legitimately expected to be\r\npaid from the proceeds of the sale.  The government did not request\r\nthat only claimants with interests superior to its own (as yet\r\ninchoate) interest in the property be paid before the balance was\r\nseized for the anticipated restitution order; rather, the June\r\norder directed that \"all secured claims, liens, and other costs\r\nassociated with the real estate closing [be] paid\" (emphasis\r\nadded).  \r\nWe express no opinion on whether, if the government had\r\ninstead sought to prevent the sale pursuant to the district court's\r\nMarch order and had asserted a lien against the property arising\r\nfrom a future restitution order, its interest would have been\r\nsuperior to Unisource's interest.  Second, as the district court\r\nnever ruled on Unisource's motion to intervene, we express no\r\nopinion on whether it was entitled to be heard at the sentencing\r\nhearing, although we believe the district judge could permit\r\nUnisource's attorney to address the court under the circumstances. \r\nFinally, this decision most emphatically does not endorse broad\r\nbankruptcy-style proceedings in the guise of sentencing hearings;\r\nsuch hearings would likely frustrate Congress' intent in enacting\r\nthe VWPA.  We hold only that, in the particular circumstances of\r\nthis case, the district court did not err by regarding Unisource's\r\ninterest in the proceeds of the sale of the condominium as\r\nsufficiently definite that it was within the terms of its June\r\norder.  Thus, the district court had authority under 28 U.S.C. \r\n1651 to order that funds be released permitting Unisource to be\r\npaid from the proceeds of the sale of the Friedman condominium. \r\nThe fact that the challenged order was part of a larger order\r\nlabeled a \"restitution\" order was an apparent slip of the pen, and\r\nwe see no need to elevate form over substance.\r\nThe judgment of the district court is affirmed. \n",

Friedman pled guilty to charges of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 and of making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1014.  The charges stemmed from check-kiting schemes in which Friedman defrauded several federally insured banks.  The government, seeking to ensure that Friedman's assets would be available to satisfy any court-imposed penalties, filed an ex parte motion under Fed.  R.Crim. Pro. 45(d) requesting an order pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, that would temporarily restrain Friedman from transferring any assets.  On March 14, 1997, the district court issued this order, requiring Friedman \"to cease all transfers of assets and funds\" and directing that \"institutions and individuals who hold any assets or funds in which Arnold I. Friedman holds an ownership interest shall not transfer any such fund or assets until further order of this Court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One asset that belonged to members of the Friedman family at this time was a condominium located in Swamscott, Massachusetts.  The owner of the condominium was the Cupid Ocean Front Realty Trust;  the trustee was Kim Friedman, Arnold Friedman's adult daughter, and the sole beneficiary was Leslie Friedman, Arnold Friedman's wife.  At the time of the court's March order, the condominium had been appraised at approximately $609,000.  On paper, Arnold Friedman had no interest in the trust or the condominium.  However, the government contended that Friedman in fact controlled the asset and that it should be attributed to him, noting that he had lived in the condominium since its purchase in 1993 and that he listed the condominium as an asset belonging to him in a February 1997 mortgage application.  Arnold Friedman acknowledges that, although his position was that the condominium belonged to his wife through a valid real estate trust, a court might conclude that he controlled the condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Friedman had disclosed the existence of the condominium and the trust to the government at a presentence interview.  Friedman's lawyer advised him that, because the district court's March order only covered assets in which he had an ownership interest, the family was free to put the condominium up for sale.  The condominium was listed with a broker.  After a few months, the family received an offer of approximately $950,000 for the condominium.  The closing date was June 26, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Friedman's lawyer, after the government learned of the impending sale of the condominium, there was a meeting between Arnold Friedman, his lawyer and officials of the Probation Department and the United States Attorney's Bank Fraud Task Force.  At that meeting, Friedman's lawyer claimed, the government agreed to permit the sale of the condominium as long as $250,000 from the proceeds of the sale were put in escrow to be available at sentencing if the court ruled that the condominium belonged to Arnold Friedman.  The government disputes that such an agreement ever existed, but does not dispute that such a meeting took place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the government never sought to stop the sale of the condominium on the ground that the sale would violate the court's March order.  Rather, on June 25, 1997, the day before closing, the government requested an ex parte order, again pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, directing the United States Marshals to seize the net proceeds of the sale.  Friedman contends that the government's action in seeking the order violated the earlier agreement, and suggests that the order was sought by a different set of government attorneys than those that were present at the meeting.  The court granted the ex parte order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order required \"all proceeds, (after all secured claims, liens and other costs associated with the real estate closing are paid) generated by the ... sale of the condominium ... [to] be turned over to the United States Marshals Service....\"  The order also directed the U.S. Marshals to hold the funds \"until further order of the Court....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to this order, the following day the U.S. Marshals seized the proceeds of the sale of the condominium at the closing.  The U.S. Marshals obtained a check for $342,899, which represented the sale price of the condominium ($954,617), less the amount of a mortgage loan ($445,935), another loan ($125,687), settlement costs, including attorney's fees, title insurance, broker's commission, etc.  ($31,421), and taxes and utility fees to the Town of Swamscott ($8950).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the seizure, one creditor was not paid who had expected to be paid from the proceeds of the sale.  That creditor, Unisource, was a supplier of Aim Chemical Enterprises, a business which Arnold and Leslie Friedman owned and operated jointly.  Under a credit arrangement with Unisource, Leslie Friedman had issued a personal guarantee of Aim Chemical's debts to Unisource, a guarantee that specifically included the condominium.  Aim Chemical had difficulty paying its bills, and Aim Chemical and Unisource worked out a payment plan.  In early 1997, Aim Chemical defaulted on this payment plan, and Unisource indicated that it would take legal action to collect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that time, Leslie Friedman asked Unisource not to attach the Swamscott property through formal legal proceedings because she believed it would have a chilling effect on the impending sale.  Unisource agreed to forbear from filing a formal attachment, but only after receiving Leslie Friedman's written guarantee, through her attorney, that it would be paid \"[f]rom the proceeds of the sale of the property\" an amount \"equal to any amounts due and owning [sic ] and outstanding for more than thirty (30) days prior to the closing date....\"  The agreement stated that, \"[s]imultaneously with the closing,\" this amount would be delivered to Unisource in a check.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  That amount, $85,773, was not paid to Unisource at the closing, as Unisource and Mrs. Friedman had agreed, and those funds were instead seized by the U.S. Marshals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day after closing, June 27, 1997, Unisource filed a pleading styled \"Motion of Unisource Worldwide, Inc. to Intervene for a Limited Purpose,\" purportedly pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2).  The motion requested that the district court \"permit[ ] Unisource to be paid from the proceeds of the sale as if it had perfected its lien,\" arguing that its forbearance had benefitted all parties, including the government, by facilitating a sale that might have been discouraged if Unisource had sought to attach the condominium through formal legal proceedings.  Unisource argued that its interest was sufficiently definite to come within the terms of the district court's June order directing that all \"secured claims, liens and other costs associated with the real estate closing\" should be paid from the proceeds of the sale prior to the seizure by the U.S. Marshals of the balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a sentencing hearing on July 30, 1997, the district court heard arguments on the condominium issue.  The defendant argued that the property belonged to his wife, as beneficiary of the real estate trust, although he acknowledged that his control of that asset rendered the issue close.  The defendant also urged the court to permit Unisource to be paid, arguing that it was necessary for Aim Chemical's continued viability that its creditors be paid and that Aim Chemical's continued profitability would ensure his ability to pay the district court's restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argued that the condominium did belong to Friedman.  The government also argued that Unisource was an unsecured creditor, and that its interest was therefore not covered by the June order.  Finally, the government argued that the district court could not release any funds to Unisource because it was not a victim of the defendant's crimes, and that the district court lacked authority under the VWPA to do anything but order restitution to the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court never acted on Unisource's motion to intervene, it permitted counsel for Unisource to address the court during the sentencing hearing.  Unisource argued that its interest in the proceeds of the sale under the letter agreement was protected by the district court's June order, and that it should be paid from the proceeds as the holder of an equitable lien to remedy the improper seizure of its share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted this argument.  It ordered restitution to the FDIC in the amount of $1,000,000, and further directed in its amended criminal judgment that \"monies seized by the government will be released to probation officer to be distributed to creditor Unisource (not the victim of the instant offense) and victim FDIC.\"  The government filed numerous motions seeking reconsideration of the order permitting Unisource to be paid, each of which was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then filed this appeal.  In effect, the government now wants the $85,773 (which both Friedman and Unisource say belongs to Unisource) to apply against Friedman's one million dollar restitution obligation, thus lowering the risk that the full sum of restitution will not be collected over time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal involves only the narrow issue of whether the district court had authority to permit Unisource to be paid from the proceeds of the sale.  The government argues that the district court did not.  Friedman did not file a cross-appeal challenging the district court's implicit determination that an interest in the condominium could be attributed to him, and that issue is therefore not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the district court's order permitting Unisource to be paid from the proceeds of the sale exceeded the district court's authority under the VWPA, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663-64.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The government argues that the district court order permitting Unisource to be paid was an order of \"restitution,\" and that, under the VWPA, \"restitution may be awarded only to a 'victim of the offense.' \"  United States v. Gibbens, 25 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(b)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no quarrel with the government's position that orders of restitution under the VWPA can only be awarded to the victim of a defendant's offense, and that ordinary creditors of a defendant may not entitle themselves to consideration for restitution by intervening at a sentencing hearing.  However, we think the government's characterization of what occurred in the district court misses the mark.  Although the district court's order permitting Unisource to be paid is memorialized in a portion of the amended criminal judgment labeled \"restitution and forfeiture,\" the sentencing hearing makes clear that the district court did not consider its order as an order requiring Friedman to pay restitution to Unisource under the VWPA.  Instead, the district court accepted Unisource's argument that it had an equitable lien or other definite interest that was protected by the court's June order which had directed the U.S. Marshals to seize only the net sale proceeds of the condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the district court never considered its authority to release funds to Unisource from the seizure as stemming from the VWPA directly;  rather, its authority derived from its inherent authority to issue all writs necessary in aid of its jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, authority which certainly includes the power to issue a subsequent order which is needed to implement an earlier order which the district court had authority to issue.  Therefore, if the district court had authority to release funds to Unisource, it stems from its authority to implement its earlier June order, obtained ex parte at the government's request, to seize the net proceeds of the condominium sale.  The order, by its terms, excluded \"all secured claims, liens and other costs associated with the real estate closing....\"  We note that this language came from the government's ex parte motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court did not err in its interpretation of its own earlier June order, its decision to release funds to Unisource can be sustained as within the district court's authority under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651.  The government does not contend that the district court's June order, obtained ex parte at the government's request, violated the VWPA because it permitted \"secured claims, liens and other costs associated with the real estate closing\" to be satisfied before the seizure of the balance of the proceeds for the ultimate purpose of providing restitution to victims.  Indeed, the government proposed that language.  Nor does the government contend that the district court lacked authority to correct a mistake in the implementation of its June order.  The district court plainly could have required, for example, that the U.S. Marshals release funds to a holder of a mortgage interest in the property whose interest had been mistakenly seized at the real estate closing, despite the fact that such a person, like Unisource, would not have been a victim of the offense under the VWPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the government contends that the district court's order protected only secured creditors and that Unisource, which had not filed a formal attachment, was not secured.  The government also argues that, because Unisource was in its view merely an ordinary, unsecured trade creditor, affirming the district court's actions would risk transforming sentencing proceedings into equitable bankruptcy-style proceedings in which various creditors of the defendant would be permitted to make claims against the defendant's property.  This, argues the government, would frustrate Congress' intent that the award of restitution to victims of crime should be the primary focus of sentencing proceedings, and that victims' claims should take priority over those of many other creditors.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3613(c) (giving liens created by orders of restitution the same status as tax liens).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree that affirming the district court's actions presents such a danger given the particular circumstances of this case.  First, the government's argument assumes that Unisource was an ordinary trade creditor, and we believe that the record does not support this contention.  Under Massachusetts law, an equitable lien is defined as \"a charge upon specific property, entitling the holder of the lien to have the property applied in equity to the payment of his debt as against all other claimants of the property except purchasers for value without notice.\"  Ballentine v. Eaton, 297 Mass. 389, 8 N.E.2d 808, 809 (1937).  In Massachusetts, an equitable lien may arise from the express agreement of a debtor to pay a creditor out of a specific fund or property.  See Check v. Kaplan, 280 Mass. 170, 182 N.E. 305, 306 (1932) (\"[A]s between the parties a right in the nature of a lien on an identified and particular fund may be created [by express agreement] which will in appropriate circumstances by enforced in equity\");  Delval v. Gagnon, 213 Mass. 203, 99 N.E. 1095 (1912);  Pinch v. Anthony, 90 Mass.  (8 Allen) 536, 539 (1864) (\"The rule is perfectly well settled, that a party may by express agreement create a charge or claim in the nature of a lien on real as well as personal estate of which he is the owner or possessor, and that equity will establish and enforce such a claim....\").  A leading legal dictionary defines the term \"equitable lien\" as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>A right, not existing at law, to have specific property applied in whole or in part to payment of a particular debt or class of debts.  An equitable lien arises either from a written contract which shows an intention to charge some particular property with a debt or obligation or is implied and declared by a court of equity out of general considerations of right and justice as applied to relations of the parties and circumstances of their dealings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Black's Law Dictionary 539 (6th ed.1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these legal principles, Unisource was no ordinary unsecured trade creditor seeking to satisfy a debt, as the government contends.  Rather, it had earlier arranged a payment plan with the Friedman business that included a personal guarantee of its debts from Leslie Friedman, a guarantee that specifically included the condominium at issue.  After the Friedman business had again become delinquent in its payments under the payment plan, Unisource announced its intention to initiate proceedings to formally attach the condominium.  Only after receiving a written promise that its debt would be satisfied from the proceeds of the impending sale did Unisource forbear from seeking the attachment.  Unisource's forbearance benefitted all parties by facilitating the sale.  This, in turn, provided the victim FDIC with substantial monetary restitution that might well have been reduced if the property had not been sold at the time, but sold later at auction, quite probably at a lower price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude that Unisource held an equitable lien under Massachusetts law arising from the April agreement.  See Check, 182 N.E. at 306 (regarding the existence of an equitable lien arising from the parties' express agreement as \"a pure question of fact upon which the decision of the trial judge must stand\").  Moreover, even if the interest was not definite enough to rise to the level of a lien under Massachusetts law, the June order did not protect only lienholders.  Rather, it also protected other third parties who expected to be paid from the proceeds of the condominium sale, such as the attorneys and brokers, none of whom necessarily had a secured interest in the property.  The district court was thus within its discretion to interpret its own June order as protecting Unisource's interest in these circumstances.  Although Unisource's claim was not specifically mentioned as among those interests that would be satisfied prior to seizure of the balance, this is explained by the fact that the order was obtained ex parte at the government's request without notice to Friedman or potential creditors.  Under such circumstances, the district court did not err by interpreting its earlier order as including Unisource as among those claimants it intended to protect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize the narrowness of our decision.  It was the government which asked for the June order to be drafted in a manner that permitted the sale to take place and which protected the interests of those third parties who legitimately expected to be paid from the proceeds of the sale.  The government did not request that only claimants with interests superior to its own (as yet inchoate) interest in the property be paid before the balance was seized for the anticipated restitution order;  rather, the June order directed that \"all secured claims, liens, and other costs associated with the real estate closing [be] paid\" (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We express no opinion on whether, if the government had instead sought to prevent the sale pursuant to the district court's March order and had asserted a lien against the property arising from a future restitution order, its interest would have been superior to Unisource's interest.  Second, as the district court never ruled on Unisource's motion to intervene, we express no opinion on whether it was entitled to be heard at the sentencing hearing, although we believe the district judge could permit Unisource's attorney to address the court under the circumstances.  Finally, this decision most emphatically does not endorse broad bankruptcy-style proceedings in the guise of sentencing hearings;  such hearings would likely frustrate Congress' intent in enacting the VWPA.  We hold only that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the district court did not err by regarding Unisource's interest in the proceeds of the sale of the condominium as sufficiently definite that it was within the terms of its June order.  Thus, the district court had authority under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651 to order that funds be released permitting Unisource to be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the Friedman condominium.  The fact that the challenged order was part of a larger order labeled a \"restitution\" order was an apparent slip of the pen, and we see no need to elevate form over substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The agreement, dated April 3, 1997, was submitted to the district court as an addendum to Unisource's \"Motion to Intervene for a Limited Purpose,\" described below.  Unisource's motion does not appear on the district court's docket sheet.  The parties agreed to provide a copy of the motion and the April agreement to this court, and the U.S. Attorney's Office, with the defendant's consent, has submitted a letter containing the agreement to this court.  We regard these letters as proper under Fed.  R.App. P. 10(e) (\"If anything material to either party is omitted from the record by error or accident or is misstated therein, the parties by stipulation ... either before or after the record is transmitted to the court of appeals ... may direct that the omission or misstatement be corrected....\")  To the extent that these letters contain argument on other matters, we do not consider them.  See Fed.  R.App. P. 28(c) (\"No further briefs may be filed except with leave of court.\")</p>\n        <p>At any event, even if Unisource's motion and the April agreement attached thereto were not filed with the district court, counsel for both Friedman and Unisource described the situation to the district judge on the record and counsel for the government did not contest the accuracy of that description.  The district judge was entitled to credit counsels' representations concerning the underlying situation in the absence of any objection from the government.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Friedman defends the district court order, arguing that because the district court plainly did have authority to spread the restitution order out over time, the district court's order effectively does the same thing and so cannot be improper.  We need not reach this argument.  Friedman's interest in this appeal is at least two-fold.  Unisource is a significant creditor of Friedman's family business, Aim Chemical, and its willingness to continue doing business with Aim Chemical depends on its getting the $85,773.  Friedman wants Unisource to continue to do business with Aim Chemical both because Aim Chemical is a source of income to his family and because any revenues from Aim Chemical may be used to meet his restitution obligation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The parties have helpfully called the court's attention to the question of whether the operative VWPA is the 1988 Amended Act, which was in place at the time of the conduct, or the 1996 Amended Act, in place at the time of sentencing, and attendant potential ex post facto clause problems.  In light of our disposition, we need not address this issue, as the outcome is not affected by which version of the VWPA applies</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Friedman was convicted of defrauding several federally insured banks and ordered at sentencing to pay restitution to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the victim of his offenses.  Before sentencing, the district court granted the government's ex parte order to seize the net proceeds of the sale of his family's oceanfront condominium to satisfy any court-imposed penalties.  The government appeals an order by the district court allowing Unisource Worldwide, Inc.  (Unisource), a creditor of defendant's business who had a guarantee from defendant's wife backed up by her interest in the condominium, to be paid from proceeds of the sale, as the holder of an interest in the nature of an equitable lien against the condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that this decision exceeded the district court's authority under the Victim Witness Protection Act (VWPA), 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3663-64, because Unisource was not the victim of defendant's offenses.  The government also argues that affirming the judge's order would risk transforming sentencing proceedings into equitable bankruptcy-style proceedings, thus frustrating Congress' basic intent to provide restitution for victims.

Rather, we regard the order as an implementation, permissible given the particular circumstances, of the district court's earlier orders affecting defendant's property.

Friedman pled guilty to charges of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 and of making false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1014.  The charges stemmed from check-kiting schemes in which Friedman defrauded several federally insured banks.  The government, seeking to ensure that Friedman's assets would be available to satisfy any court-imposed penalties, filed an ex parte motion under Fed.  R.Crim. Pro. 45(d) requesting an order pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, that would temporarily restrain Friedman from transferring any assets.  On March 14, 1997, the district court issued this order, requiring Friedman \"to cease all transfers of assets and funds\" and directing that \"institutions and individuals who hold any assets or funds in which Arnold I. Friedman holds an ownership interest shall not transfer any such fund or assets until further order of this Court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One asset that belonged to members of the Friedman family at this time was a condominium located in Swamscott, Massachusetts.  The owner of the condominium was the Cupid Ocean Front Realty Trust;  the trustee was Kim Friedman, Arnold Friedman's adult daughter, and the sole beneficiary was Leslie Friedman, Arnold Friedman's wife.  At the time of the court's March order, the condominium had been appraised at approximately $609,000.  On paper, Arnold Friedman had no interest in the trust or the condominium.  However, the government contended that Friedman in fact controlled the asset and that it should be attributed to him, noting that he had lived in the condominium since its purchase in 1993 and that he listed the condominium as an asset belonging to him in a February 1997 mortgage application.  Arnold Friedman acknowledges that, although his position was that the condominium belonged to his wife through a valid real estate trust, a court might conclude that he controlled the condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Friedman had disclosed the existence of the condominium and the trust to the government at a presentence interview.  Friedman's lawyer advised him that, because the district court's March order only covered assets in which he had an ownership interest, the family was free to put the condominium up for sale.  The condominium was listed with a broker.  After a few months, the family received an offer of approximately $950,000 for the condominium.  The closing date was June 26, 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Friedman's lawyer, after the government learned of the impending sale of the condominium, there was a meeting between Arnold Friedman, his lawyer and officials of the Probation Department and the United States Attorney's Bank Fraud Task Force.  At that meeting, Friedman's lawyer claimed, the government agreed to permit the sale of the condominium as long as $250,000 from the proceeds of the sale were put in escrow to be available at sentencing if the court ruled that the condominium belonged to Arnold Friedman.  The government disputes that such an agreement ever existed, but does not dispute that such a meeting took place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the government never sought to stop the sale of the condominium on the ground that the sale would violate the court's March order.  Rather, on June 25, 1997, the day before closing, the government requested an ex parte order, again pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, directing the United States Marshals to seize the net proceeds of the sale.  Friedman contends that the government's action in seeking the order violated the earlier agreement, and suggests that the order was sought by a different set of government attorneys than those that were present at the meeting.  The court granted the ex parte order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order required \"all proceeds, (after all secured claims, liens and other costs associated with the real estate closing are paid) generated by the ... sale of the condominium ... [to] be turned over to the United States Marshals Service....\"  The order also directed the U.S. Marshals to hold the funds \"until further order of the Court....\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to this order, the following day the U.S. Marshals seized the proceeds of the sale of the condominium at the closing.  The U.S. Marshals obtained a check for $342,899, which represented the sale price of the condominium ($954,617), less the amount of a mortgage loan ($445,935), another loan ($125,687), settlement costs, including attorney's fees, title insurance, broker's commission, etc.  ($31,421), and taxes and utility fees to the Town of Swamscott ($8950).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result of the seizure, one creditor was not paid who had expected to be paid from the proceeds of the sale.  That creditor, Unisource, was a supplier of Aim Chemical Enterprises, a business which Arnold and Leslie Friedman owned and operated jointly.  Under a credit arrangement with Unisource, Leslie Friedman had issued a personal guarantee of Aim Chemical's debts to Unisource, a guarantee that specifically included the condominium.  Aim Chemical had difficulty paying its bills, and Aim Chemical and Unisource worked out a payment plan.  In early 1997, Aim Chemical defaulted on this payment plan, and Unisource indicated that it would take legal action to collect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that time, Leslie Friedman asked Unisource not to attach the Swamscott property through formal legal proceedings because she believed it would have a chilling effect on the impending sale.  Unisource agreed to forbear from filing a formal attachment, but only after receiving Leslie Friedman's written guarantee, through her attorney, that it would be paid \"[f]rom the proceeds of the sale of the property\" an amount \"equal to any amounts due and owning [sic ] and outstanding for more than thirty (30) days prior to the closing date....\"  The agreement stated that, \"[s]imultaneously with the closing,\" this amount would be delivered to Unisource in a check.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  That amount, $85,773, was not paid to Unisource at the closing, as Unisource and Mrs. Friedman had agreed, and those funds were instead seized by the U.S. Marshals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day after closing, June 27, 1997, Unisource filed a pleading styled \"Motion of Unisource Worldwide, Inc. to Intervene for a Limited Purpose,\" purportedly pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2).  The motion requested that the district court \"permit[ ] Unisource to be paid from the proceeds of the sale as if it had perfected its lien,\" arguing that its forbearance had benefitted all parties, including the government, by facilitating a sale that might have been discouraged if Unisource had sought to attach the condominium through formal legal proceedings.  Unisource argued that its interest was sufficiently definite to come within the terms of the district court's June order directing that all \"secured claims, liens and other costs associated with the real estate closing\" should be paid from the proceeds of the sale prior to the seizure by the U.S. Marshals of the balance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a sentencing hearing on July 30, 1997, the district court heard arguments on the condominium issue.  The defendant argued that the property belonged to his wife, as beneficiary of the real estate trust, although he acknowledged that his control of that asset rendered the issue close.  The defendant also urged the court to permit Unisource to be paid, arguing that it was necessary for Aim Chemical's continued viability that its creditors be paid and that Aim Chemical's continued profitability would ensure his ability to pay the district court's restitution order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argued that the condominium did belong to Friedman.  The government also argued that Unisource was an unsecured creditor, and that its interest was therefore not covered by the June order.  Finally, the government argued that the district court could not release any funds to Unisource because it was not a victim of the defendant's crimes, and that the district court lacked authority under the VWPA to do anything but order restitution to the victim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the district court never acted on Unisource's motion to intervene, it permitted counsel for Unisource to address the court during the sentencing hearing.  Unisource argued that its interest in the proceeds of the sale under the letter agreement was protected by the district court's June order, and that it should be paid from the proceeds as the holder of an equitable lien to remedy the improper seizure of its share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court accepted this argument.  It ordered restitution to the FDIC in the amount of $1,000,000, and further directed in its amended criminal judgment that \"monies seized by the government will be released to probation officer to be distributed to creditor Unisource (not the victim of the instant offense) and victim FDIC.\"  The government filed numerous motions seeking reconsideration of the order permitting Unisource to be paid, each of which was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then filed this appeal.  In effect, the government now wants the $85,773 (which both Friedman and Unisource say belongs to Unisource) to apply against Friedman's one million dollar restitution obligation, thus lowering the risk that the full sum of restitution will not be collected over time.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal involves only the narrow issue of whether the district court had authority to permit Unisource to be paid from the proceeds of the sale.  The government argues that the district court did not.  Friedman did not file a cross-appeal challenging the district court's implicit determination that an interest in the condominium could be attributed to him, and that issue is therefore not before us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that the district court's order permitting Unisource to be paid from the proceeds of the sale exceeded the district court's authority under the VWPA, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663-64.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The government argues that the district court order permitting Unisource to be paid was an order of \"restitution,\" and that, under the VWPA, \"restitution may be awarded only to a 'victim of the offense.' \"  United States v. Gibbens, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195396\"><a href=\"/opinion/195396/united-states-v-gibbens/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.1994) (quoting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3663(b)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have no quarrel with the government's position that orders of restitution under the VWPA can only be awarded to the victim of a defendant's offense, and that ordinary creditors of a defendant may not entitle themselves to consideration for restitution by intervening at a sentencing hearing.  However, we think the government's characterization of what occurred in the district court misses the mark.  Although the district court's order permitting Unisource to be paid is memorialized in a portion of the amended criminal judgment labeled \"restitution and forfeiture,\" the sentencing hearing makes clear that the district court did not consider its order as an order requiring Friedman to pay restitution to Unisource under the VWPA.  Instead, the district court accepted Unisource's argument that it had an equitable lien or other definite interest that was protected by the court's June order which had directed the U.S. Marshals to seize only the net sale proceeds of the condominium.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the district court never considered its authority to release funds to Unisource from the seizure as stemming from the VWPA directly;  rather, its authority derived from its inherent authority to issue all writs necessary in aid of its jurisdiction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651, authority which certainly includes the power to issue a subsequent order which is needed to implement an earlier order which the district court had authority to issue.  Therefore, if the district court had authority to release funds to Unisource, it stems from its authority to implement its earlier June order, obtained ex parte at the government's request, to seize the net proceeds of the condominium sale.  The order, by its terms, excluded \"all secured claims, liens and other costs associated with the real estate closing....\"  We note that this language came from the government's ex parte motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the district court did not err in its interpretation of its own earlier June order, its decision to release funds to Unisource can be sustained as within the district court's authority under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651.  The government does not contend that the district court's June order, obtained ex parte at the government's request, violated the VWPA because it permitted \"secured claims, liens and other costs associated with the real estate closing\" to be satisfied before the seizure of the balance of the proceeds for the ultimate purpose of providing restitution to victims.  Indeed, the government proposed that language.  Nor does the government contend that the district court lacked authority to correct a mistake in the implementation of its June order.  The district court plainly could have required, for example, that the U.S. Marshals release funds to a holder of a mortgage interest in the property whose interest had been mistakenly seized at the real estate closing, despite the fact that such a person, like Unisource, would not have been a victim of the offense under the VWPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead, the government contends that the district court's order protected only secured creditors and that Unisource, which had not filed a formal attachment, was not secured.  The government also argues that, because Unisource was in its view merely an ordinary, unsecured trade creditor, affirming the district court's actions would risk transforming sentencing proceedings into equitable bankruptcy-style proceedings in which various creditors of the defendant would be permitted to make claims against the defendant's property.  This, argues the government, would frustrate Congress' intent that the award of restitution to victims of crime should be the primary focus of sentencing proceedings, and that victims' claims should take priority over those of many other creditors.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3613(c) (giving liens created by orders of restitution the same status as tax liens).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not agree that affirming the district court's actions presents such a danger given the particular circumstances of this case.  First, the government's argument assumes that Unisource was an ordinary trade creditor, and we believe that the record does not support this contention.  Under Massachusetts law, an equitable lien is defined as \"a charge upon specific property, entitling the holder of the lien to have the property applied in equity to the payment of his debt as against all other claimants of the property except purchasers for value without notice.\"  Ballentine v. Eaton, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></span>, 809 (1937).  In Massachusetts, an equitable lien may arise from the express agreement of a debtor to pay a creditor out of a specific fund or property.  See Check v. Kaplan, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></span>, 306 (1932) (\"[A]s between the parties a right in the nature of a lien on an identified and particular fund may be created [by express agreement] which will in appropriate circumstances by enforced in equity\");  Delval v. Gagnon, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">1095</span></span> (1912);  Pinch v. Anthony, 90 Mass.  (8 Allen) 536, 539 (1864) (\"The rule is perfectly well settled, that a party may by express agreement create a charge or claim in the nature of a lien on real as well as personal estate of which he is the owner or possessor, and that equity will establish and enforce such a claim....\").  A leading legal dictionary defines the term \"equitable lien\" as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>A right, not existing at law, to have specific property applied in whole or in part to payment of a particular debt or class of debts.  An equitable lien arises either from a written contract which shows an intention to charge some particular property with a debt or obligation or is implied and declared by a court of equity out of general considerations of right and justice as applied to relations of the parties and circumstances of their dealings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Black's Law Dictionary 539 (6th ed.1990) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these legal principles, Unisource was no ordinary unsecured trade creditor seeking to satisfy a debt, as the government contends.  Rather, it had earlier arranged a payment plan with the Friedman business that included a personal guarantee of its debts from Leslie Friedman, a guarantee that specifically included the condominium at issue.  After the Friedman business had again become delinquent in its payments under the payment plan, Unisource announced its intention to initiate proceedings to formally attach the condominium.  Only after receiving a written promise that its debt would be satisfied from the proceeds of the impending sale did Unisource forbear from seeking the attachment.  Unisource's forbearance benefitted all parties by facilitating the sale.  This, in turn, provided the victim FDIC with substantial monetary restitution that might well have been reduced if the property had not been sold at the time, but sold later at auction, quite probably at a lower price.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, it was not clearly erroneous for the district court to conclude that Unisource held an equitable lien under Massachusetts law arising from the April agreement.  See Check, 182 N.E. at 306 (regarding the existence of an equitable lien arising from the parties' express agreement as \"a pure question of fact upon which the decision of the trial judge must stand\").  Moreover, even if the interest was not definite enough to rise to the level of a lien under Massachusetts law, the June order did not protect only lienholders.  Rather, it also protected other third parties who expected to be paid from the proceeds of the condominium sale, such as the attorneys and brokers, none of whom necessarily had a secured interest in the property.  The district court was thus within its discretion to interpret its own June order as protecting Unisource's interest in these circumstances.  Although Unisource's claim was not specifically mentioned as among those interests that would be satisfied prior to seizure of the balance, this is explained by the fact that the order was obtained ex parte at the government's request without notice to Friedman or potential creditors.  Under such circumstances, the district court did not err by interpreting its earlier order as including Unisource as among those claimants it intended to protect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We emphasize the narrowness of our decision.  It was the government which asked for the June order to be drafted in a manner that permitted the sale to take place and which protected the interests of those third parties who legitimately expected to be paid from the proceeds of the sale.  The government did not request that only claimants with interests superior to its own (as yet inchoate) interest in the property be paid before the balance was seized for the anticipated restitution order;  rather, the June order directed that \"all secured claims, liens, and other costs associated with the real estate closing [be] paid\" (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We express no opinion on whether, if the government had instead sought to prevent the sale pursuant to the district court's March order and had asserted a lien against the property arising from a future restitution order, its interest would have been superior to Unisource's interest.  Second, as the district court never ruled on Unisource's motion to intervene, we express no opinion on whether it was entitled to be heard at the sentencing hearing, although we believe the district judge could permit Unisource's attorney to address the court under the circumstances.  Finally, this decision most emphatically does not endorse broad bankruptcy-style proceedings in the guise of sentencing hearings;  such hearings would likely frustrate Congress' intent in enacting the VWPA.  We hold only that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the district court did not err by regarding Unisource's interest in the proceeds of the sale of the condominium as sufficiently definite that it was within the terms of its June order.  Thus, the district court had authority under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1651 to order that funds be released permitting Unisource to be paid from the proceeds of the sale of the Friedman condominium.  The fact that the challenged order was part of a larger order labeled a \"restitution\" order was an apparent slip of the pen, and we see no need to elevate form over substance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The agreement, dated April 3, 1997, was submitted to the district court as an addendum to Unisource's \"Motion to Intervene for a Limited Purpose,\" described below.  Unisource's motion does not appear on the district court's docket sheet.  The parties agreed to provide a copy of the motion and the April agreement to this court, and the U.S. Attorney's Office, with the defendant's consent, has submitted a letter containing the agreement to this court.  We regard these letters as proper under Fed.  R.App. P. 10(e) (\"If anything material to either party is omitted from the record by error or accident or is misstated therein, the parties by stipulation ... either before or after the record is transmitted to the court of appeals ... may direct that the omission or misstatement be corrected....\")  To the extent that these letters contain argument on other matters, we do not consider them.  See Fed.  R.App. P. 28(c) (\"No further briefs may be filed except with leave of court.\")</p>\n        <p>At any event, even if Unisource's motion and the April agreement attached thereto were not filed with the district court, counsel for both Friedman and Unisource described the situation to the district judge on the record and counsel for the government did not contest the accuracy of that description.  The district judge was entitled to credit counsels' representations concerning the underlying situation in the absence of any objection from the government.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Friedman defends the district court order, arguing that because the district court plainly did have authority to spread the restitution order out over time, the district court's order effectively does the same thing and so cannot be improper.  We need not reach this argument.  Friedman's interest in this appeal is at least two-fold.  Unisource is a significant creditor of Friedman's family business, Aim Chemical, and its willingness to continue doing business with Aim Chemical depends on its getting the $85,773.  Friedman wants Unisource to continue to do business with Aim Chemical both because Aim Chemical is a source of income to his family and because any revenues from Aim Chemical may be used to meet his restitution obligation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The parties have helpfully called the court's attention to the question of whether the operative VWPA is the 1988 Amended Act, which was in place at the time of the conduct, or the 1996 Amended Act, in place at the time of sentencing, and attendant potential ex post facto clause problems.  In light of our disposition, we need not address this issue, as the outcome is not affected by which version of the VWPA applies</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
