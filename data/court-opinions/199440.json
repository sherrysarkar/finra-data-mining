Daniel R. Domínguez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Chief Judge,\n                Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, and Yasmin A.\nIrizarry, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for appellant.\n     Lena Watkins, Trial Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n\n                          June 12, 2001\n\f\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Carlos Ramirez pled guilty to\n\nmarijuana distribution, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841 and 846, and associated\n\nmoney laundering charges, 18 U.S.C. § 1956(h).                  Ramirez was\n\nsentenced to five years, the statutory mandatory minimum.                 His\n\nplea agreement acknowledged that minimum. He had, at the time of\n\nfederal sentencing, already served six months of a nine-month\n\nCalifornia     state    sentence   relating   to     the   same   marijuana\n\ntransaction; he had been released early in California for good\n\nbehavior.\n\n            At issue in this sentencing appeal is whether the\n\ndistrict court had discretion to grant a six month \"credit\"\n\nagainst the federal sentence to account for the state time\n\nserved.   Ramirez was arrested on federal charges on the day of\n\nhis release from state prison.            The district court concluded\n\nthat it was barred from granting Ramirez credit for his state\n\nsentence, and that the only mechanism available to Ramirez was\n\nto   request   credit    through   the    Attorney    General     under   the\n\nprocedures set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3585.1            Ramirez challenges\n\n\n     1\n       18 U.S.C. § 3585 provides: \"A defendant shall be given\ncredit toward the service of a term of imprisonment for any\ntime he has spent in official detention prior to the date the\nsentence commences -- (1) as a result of the offense for which\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthat   determination,    arguing     that     18   U.S.C.   §   3585   is\n\ninapplicable by its terms and therefore the court must find some\n\nother way to do justice and give him credit.\n\n          The government argues that: (1) Ramirez has waived his\n\nright to appeal by signing a plea agreement that generally\n\nwaived the right to appeal his sentence provided it was within\n\nthe guidelines range; and (2) there was, on the merits, no\n\nauthority which permitted the district court to provide the\n\ncredit requested.\n\nWaiver of Appeal\n\n          In the plea agreement, Ramirez expressly waived the\n\nright to appeal his sentence \"unless the court impose[d] a\n\ncustodial sentence greater than the high end of the guideline\n\nrange and (of [the] statutory minimum term, if applicable)\n\nrecommended by the government.\"          Ordinarily we would reach the\n\nwaiver issue first.     Under the circumstances of this case, we\n\n\n\n\nthe sentence was imposed; or (2) as a result of any other\ncharge for which the defendant was arrested after the\ncommission of the offense for which the sentence was imposed;\nthat has not been credited against another sentence.\" The\nparties both argue that the district court was wrong to\nbelieve that Ramirez could get credit under § 3585. We do not\nreach the issue here.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fbelieve it more prudent not to resolve the waiver issue.     At\n\nRamirez's change of plea hearing, the magistrate judge did not\n\ninquire whether the waiver of appeal was knowing and voluntary.\n\nFurther, when asked by the magistrate judge to outline the plea\n\nagreement, the government said nothing about the waiver of\n\nappellate rights.    The magistrate judge also advised Ramirez:\n\n\"You have a right to appeal sentences that are high or low, you\n\nalways have the right to appeal.\"      (emphasis added).    The\n\ngovernment then failed to offer a correction to the Magistrate\n\nJudge’s statement.   Because of the problematic nature of these\n\nevents, we turn to the merits.\n\nCredit for State Sentence\n\n         The district court's interpretation of the guidelines\n\nas a matter of law is reviewed de novo.       United States v.\n\nCaraballo, 200 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1999).   Determinations of\n\nfact are reviewed for clear error.     United States v. Santos\n\nBatista, 239 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n         Ramirez argues, based on commentary to U.S.S.G. §\n\n5G1.3(b), that the district court should have credited his six\n\nmonth sentence for the related offense toward the statutory\n\nmandatory minimum sentence.    For sentencing guidelines cases,\n\n                               -5-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 5G1.3(b) requires that when an undischarged term of\n\nimprisonment \"'resulted from offense(s) that have been fully\n\ntaken into account in the determination of the offense level for\n\nthe instant offense,' the new sentence must run concurrently\n\nwith the undischarged term.\" United States v. Austin, 239 F.3d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting U.S.S.G. § 5G1.3(b)).             Further,\n\nthe guidelines commentary advises a sentencing court imposing a\n\nconcurrent sentence pursuant to section 5G1.3(b) to adjust the\n\nsentence for the instant offense by crediting any period of\n\nimprisonment already served for the underlying conduct \"if the\n\ncourt   determines   that   period   of   imprisonment   will    not   be\n\ncredited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5G1.3 cmt. n.2.           Section 5G1.3 was designed to\n\nprevent duplicative punishment by coordinating sentences, in\n\ncertain circumstances, for related crimes. See Austin, 239 F.3d\n\nat 5.\n\n          There are two problems with Ramirez's reliance on\n\nsection 5G1.3(b) and its commentary.           First, the sentence\n\ninvolved here is a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, not a\n\nguidelines sentence, and so caselaw concerning the granting of\n\ncredit for   guidelines purposes does not necessarily govern.\n\n                                 -6-\n\fExcept in limited circumstances,2 sentencing guidelines cannot\n\nbe employed to impose a sentence below an applicable statutory\n\nmandatory minimum.   Melendez v. United States, 518 U.S. 120,\n\n126-27 (1996).\n\n         Some courts of appeal have nonetheless applied § 5G1.3\n\nand Application Note 2 to cases involving statutory mandatory\n\nminimum sentences, crediting a defendant for time served in an\n\nundischarged, concurrent term of imprisonment, so long as the\n\ntotal of the time served and the reduced federal sentence equals\n\nor exceeds the statutory mandatory minimum period.   See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Ross, 219 F.3d 592, 594-95 (7th Cir. 2000);\n\nUnited States v. Drake, 49 F.3d 1438, 1440-41 (9th Cir. 1995);\n\nUnited States v. Kiefer, 20 F.3d 874, 876-77 (8th Cir. 1994).3\n\n\n\n\n    2\n          A district court has authority to impose a sentence\nbelow the statutory minimum if the government files a motion\nacknowledging defendant's substantial assistance, 18 U.S.C. §\n3553(e), or if a defendant provides complete information\npursuant to the \"safety valve\" provision, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f).\nMelendez v. United States, 518 U.S. 120, 126-27 (1996).\nRamirez declined to avail himself of the safety valve, see\ninfra.\n    3\n          Some statutes provide that mandatory minimum\nsentences shall not run concurrently with any other sentence.\nSee, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 924(a)(4). The statute at issue here\ndoes not contain such language.\n\n                              -7-\n\fThe theory is that the federal mandatory minimum statute does\n\nnot specify any particular way in which that minimum term is to\n\nbe achieved.   This court has not ruled on the issue.         And we\n\nneed not reach it here, as Ramirez's argument faces a different,\n\nand     ultimately          insurmountable,           hurdle.\n\n          Ramirez's second problem is that even if an analogy to\n\nthe guidelines were accepted, it would do Ramirez no good.         The\n\nissue here involves the giving of credit when the defendant has\n\nalready completed his state sentence for the related conduct.\n\nApplication note 2 to § 5G1.3 allows for a credit adjustment\n\n\"[w]hen a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b).\"         And\n\nthe concurrent sentencing requirement of § 5G1.3(b), in turn, is\n\nonly   triggered   when   there    is   an   undischarged   term   of\n\nimprisonment at the time of sentencing.        See United States v.\n\nRizzo, 121 F.3d 794, 800 (1st Cir. 1997).            A defendant's\n\neligibility for credit is derivative of his eligibility for a\n\nconcurrent sentence.      As a result, even if we extended the\n\nprinciple of § 5G1.3 to this case, Ramirez would not be entitled\n\nto credit because his state sentence was not undischarged\n\n(rather, it was discharged) at the time he was sentenced on the\n\nfederal counts.    See United States v. Cofske, 157 F.3d 1, 1-2\n\n                                  -8-\n\f(1st Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (defendant not entitled to credit\n\nunder    §    5G1.3   for   discharged    state   prison   term,   despite\n\nundischarged term of probation); Rizzo, 121 F.3d at 800 (§ 5G1.3\n\ndoes not apply where term of imprisonment for prior conviction\n\nwas discharged before sentencing for new indictment).\n\n              Our sister circuit courts have also held that § 5G1.3\n\nis inapplicable to a discharged term of imprisonment.                 See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Turnipseed, 159 F.3d 383, 386-87 (9th\n\nCir. 1998); United States v. McHan, 101 F.3d 1027, 1040 (4th\n\nCir. 1996);      United States v. Ogg, 992 F.2d 265, 266 (10th Cir.\n\n1993).       As held by the Second Circuit:\n\n              [T]he predicate is that the defendant's\n              prior prison term remains \"undischarged.\"\n              There is no provision, either in the\n              [Sentencing   Reform]   Act    or   in   the\n              Guidelines, stating that the court may order\n              that the sentence it imposes be deemed to\n              have been served concurrently with a prior\n              prison term that has been fully discharged.\n              If the defendant has completed his state\n              prison term before the federal sentence is\n              imposed, § 5G1.3 does not apply, and his\n              federal prison term cannot be imposed\n              concurrently.\n\nUnited States v. Labeille-Soto, 163 F.3d 93, 99 (2d Cir. 1998)\n\n(emphasis added); cf. United States v. Parkinson, 44 F.3d 6, 8\n\n(1st Cir. 1994) (\"Section 5G1.3 is designed to achieve an\n\n                                    -9-\n\fincremental punishment for a defendant who, at the time of\n\nsentencing        for   the    instant   offense,   is   subject   to   an\n\nundischarged term of imprisonment.\").            By the time Ramirez was\n\nsentenced on the federal counts on August 28, 2000, a full year\n\nhad passed since his state sentence was discharged.\n\n              Ramirez makes a second argument that the district court\n\nmust       have   sentencing     discretion    because   the   government\n\ncompromised his ability to seek credit under § 5G1.3 by waiting\n\nto arrest him until the day he discharged his state sentence.4\n\nThis is like the argument presented by the defendant in Rizzo,\n\nsupra, who accused the government of delaying his federal\n\nindictment until he had served his state sentence so as to\n\nrender him ineligible for a concurrent sentence. This court has\n\nrecognized that deliberate government manipulation of some\n\nsentencing factors might give a defendant grounds for relief,\n\nbut it has set a high threshold.              \"[D]eliberate tampering to\n\n\n       4\n          The district court's statement at sentencing, that\nthe court could have given Ramirez credit for time served had\nRamirez been arrested while serving his state sentence, may\nreflect a misunderstanding about when the concurrency\nprinciple of § 5G1.3 is triggered. The trigger date for\nwhether the state sentence is \"undischarged\" is the date of\nthe federal sentencing, not the date of arrest on federal\ncharges. See, e.g., Labeille-Soto, 163 F.3d at 99.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fincrease a sentence would be a concern, but the ordinary\n\naccidents of acceleration or delay are part of the fabric of\n\ncriminal proceedings.\"    United States v. Saldana, 109 F.3d 100,\n\n104 (1st Cir. 1997).     Ramirez does not come close.\n\n         In sum, even if we were to apply guidelines analysis\n\nto a statutory mandatory minimum sentence case, it does not help\n\nRamirez. The only avenue for relief available to Ramirez in the\n\ndistrict court from the applicable statutory mandatory minimum\n\nsentence was to provide the government \"all information and\n\nevidence\" he had about the offenses at issue, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3553(f) (the \"safety valve\" provision). But Ramirez declined to\n\ndo so.\n\n         The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

Irizarry, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for appellant.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lena Watkins, Trial Attorney, U.S. Department of Justice, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before Torruella, Chief Judge, Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Carlos Ramirez pled guilty to marijuana distribution, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841 and 846, and associated money laundering charges, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(h). Ramirez was sentenced to five years, the statutory mandatory minimum. His plea agreement acknowledged that minimum. He had, at the time of federal sentencing, already served six months of a nine-month California state sentence relating to the same marijuana transaction; he had been released early in California for good behavior.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At issue in this sentencing appeal is whether the district court had discretion to grant a six month \"credit\" against the federal sentence to account for the state time served. Ramirez was arrested on federal charges on the day of his release from state prison. The district court concluded that it was barred from granting Ramirez credit for his state sentence, and that the only mechanism available to Ramirez was to request credit through the Attorney General under the procedures set forth in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3585.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Ramirez challenges that determination, arguing that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3585 is inapplicable by its terms and therefore the court must find some other way to do justice and give him credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that: (1) Ramirez has waived his right to appeal by signing a plea agreement that generally waived the right to appeal his sentence provided it was within the guidelines range; and (2) there was, on the merits, no authority which permitted the district court to provide the credit requested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Waiver of Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the plea agreement, Ramirez expressly waived the right to appeal his sentence \"unless the court impose[d] a custodial sentence greater than the high end of the guideline range and (of [the] statutory minimum term, if applicable) recommended by the government.\" Ordinarily we would reach the waiver issue first. Under the circumstances of this case, we believe it more prudent not to resolve the waiver issue. At Ramirez's change of plea hearing, the magistrate judge did not inquire whether the waiver of appeal was knowing and voluntary. Further, when asked by the magistrate judge to outline the plea agreement, the government said nothing about the waiver of appellate rights. The magistrate judge also advised Ramirez: \"You have a right to appeal sentences that are high or low, you always have the right to appeal.\" (emphasis added). The government then failed to offer a correction to the Magistrate Judge's statement. Because of the problematic nature of these events, we turn to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Credit for State Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's interpretation of the guidelines as a matter of law is reviewed de novo.

Determinations of fact are reviewed for clear error. United States v.

For sentencing guidelines cases, U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(b) requires that when an undischarged term of imprisonment \"'resulted from offense(s) that have been fully taken into account in the determination of the offense level for the instant offense,' the new sentence must run concurrently with the undischarged term.\" United States v. Austin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771952\"><a href=\"/opinion/771952/united-states-v-chad-austin/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3(b)). Further, the guidelines commentary advises a sentencing court imposing a concurrent sentence pursuant to section 5G1.3(b) to adjust the sentence for the instant offense by crediting any period of imprisonment already served for the underlying conduct \"if the court determines that period of imprisonment will not be credited to the federal sentence by the Bureau of Prisons.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.3 cmt. n.2. Section 5G1.3 was designed to prevent duplicative punishment by coordinating sentences, in certain circumstances, for related crimes. See Austin, 239 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two problems with Ramirez's reliance on section 5G1.3(b) and its commentary. First, the sentence involved here is a statutory mandatory minimum sentence, not a guidelines sentence, and so case law concerning the granting of credit for guidelines purposes does not necessarily govern. Except in limited circumstances,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> sentencing guidelines cannot be employed to impose a sentence below an applicable statutory mandatory minimum. Melendez v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118045\"><a href=\"/opinion/118045/melendez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 126-27 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some courts of appeal have nonetheless applied &#167; 5G1.3 and Application Note 2 to cases involving statutory mandatory minimum sentences, crediting a defendant for time served in an undischarged, concurrent term of imprisonment, so long as the total of the time served and the reduced federal sentence equals or exceeds the statutory mandatory minimum period. See, e.g., United States v. Ross, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769534\"><a href=\"/opinion/769534/united-states-v-nicholas-j-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 594-95 (7th Cir. 2000); United States v. Drake, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691391\"><a href=\"/opinion/691391/united-states-v-anthony-scott-drake/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1438</span></a></span>, 1440-41 (9th Cir. 1995); United States v. Kiefer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"666908\"><a href=\"/opinion/666908/united-states-v-ronald-joseph-kiefer/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></a></span>, 876-77 (8th Cir. 1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The theory is that the federal mandatory minimum statute does not specify any particular way in which that minimum term is to be achieved. This court has not ruled on the issue. And we need not reach it here, as Ramirez's argument faces a different, and ultimately insurmountable, hurdle. Ramirez's second problem is that even if an analogy to the guidelines were accepted, it would do Ramirez no good. The issue here involves the giving of credit when the defendant has already completed his state sentence for the related conduct. Application note 2 to &#167; 5G1.3 allows for a credit adjustment \"[w]hen a sentence is imposed pursuant to subsection (b).\" And the concurrent sentencing requirement of &#167; 5G1.3(b), in turn, is only triggered when there is an undischarged term of imprisonment at the time of sentencing. See United States v. Rizzo, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></span>, 800 (1st Cir. 1997). A defendant's eligibility for credit is derivative of his eligibility for a concurrent sentence. As a result, even if we extended the principle of &#167; 5G1.3 to this case, Ramirez would not be entitled to credit because his state sentence was not undischarged (rather, it was discharged) at the time he was sentenced on the federal counts. See United States v. Cofske, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 1-2 (1st Cir. 1998) (per curiam) (defendant not entitled to credit under &#167; 5G1.3 for discharged state prison term, despite undischarged term of probation); Rizzo, 121 F.3d at 800 (&#167; 5G1.3 does not apply where term of imprisonment for prior conviction was discharged before sentencing for new indictment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our sister circuit courts have also held that &#167; 5G1.3 is inapplicable to a discharged term of imprisonment.
