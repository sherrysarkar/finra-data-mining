This opinion is a continuation\r\nof King v. Greenblatt (\"King II\"), 127 F.3d 190 (1st Cir. 1997),\r\nwhich is the latest judicial discussion in a group of cases dating\r\nback to 1972, concerning a resident population of civilly committed\r\nsexually dangerous persons in the Treatment Center at the\r\nMassachusetts Correctional Institute in Bridgewater, Massachusetts\r\n(Center).  A reference to prior cases is contained in the opinion\r\njust cited.  Our present review concerns the proposed\r\nmodifications, granted by the district court, of two longstanding\r\nconsent decrees, the Original Decree and the Supplemental Decree. \r\nThe Original Decree had provided that the Center would be\r\ntreated as a facility of the Department of Mental Health (DMH),\r\nwith primary authority to be exercised by DMH and custodial \r\npersonnel to be controlled by the Department of Correction (DOC). \r\nPatients were to have \"the least restrictive conditions necessary\r\nto achieve the purpose of commitment.\"  Both DMH and DOC were to\r\n\"take steps jointly\" to improve physical conditions, carry out a\r\nmeaningful work program, and have \"a system of differing security\r\nfor different categories of patients\" to permit less restrictive\r\nconditions for those patients not requiring maximum security.  \r\nIn an earlier opinion we considered challenges to proposed\r\nmodifications of that decree.  See King v. Greenblatt (\"King I\"),\r\n52 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1995).  We addressed the significance of the\r\nrecently enacted 1993 Mass Acts. ch. 489, which gave DOC exclusive\r\njurisdiction of the care, treatment, rehabilitation and   an added\r\nstatutory goal   custody of civilly committed sexually dangerous\r\npersons in the Center.  We held that this statute met the first\r\nprong of Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U.S. 367, 384\r\n(1992) (i.e., it was a significant change of law impacting an\r\nexisting consent decree, warranting modification of such decree),\r\nbut remanded the case to the district court to consider whether the\r\nproposed modifications met the second Rufo prong, id. (i.e.,\r\nwhether the modifications were \"suitably tailored\" to the new law). \r\nSee King I, 52 F.3d at 7.\r\nUpon remand, the district court found that the proposed\r\nmodifications to the Original Degree were \"suitably tailored\" to the\r\nnew law; the court also determined that the proposed modifications\r\nto the Supplemental Decree met both prongs of Rufo as they were\r\n\"sufficiently related\" to the change in state law and \"suitably\r\ntailored.\"  The case was then appealed to us.  We remanded it to\r\nthe district court to address only issues relevant to the\r\nSupplemental Decree, and reserved our \"suitable tailoring\" review\r\nand all other issues relating to the Original Decree.\r\nWe recognized that the proposed modifications in the\r\nSupplemental Decree went beyond a transfer of exclusive authority\r\nto DOC and would effect substantive changes in disciplinary\r\npolicies, allowing the imposition of sequestration for punishment\r\npurposes (except for acts underlying commitment) and deleting a ban\r\non all discipline and punitive procedures in the treatment of\r\ninmates civilly committed.  See King II, 127 F.3d at 195.  We\r\nopined that the link between a change in administration and\r\nsequestration policy was too tenuous, at least without further\r\ndevelopment.  Id.  We also held that neither Chapter 489, \"at least\r\nwithout further explanation,\" nor our speculation, standing alone,\r\nthat the Massachusetts legislature had apparently accepted a\r\npreference for behavior modification over mental health treatment\r\nwould constitute a \"significant change in law\" affecting\r\nsequestration policy.  Id.\r\nWe therefore sent back the proposed modifications of the  \r\nSupplemental Decree to the district court for further\r\nconsideration, leaving it to the court to decide whether additional \r\nfactual or opinion evidence was needed.  The court has since\r\ncomplied with our directive and, after hearing and submissions, has\r\ndetermined both that the change in control managed by Chapter 489\r\nis a significant change in the law affecting the Supplemental\r\nDecree and that the modifications were suitably tailored.  We now\r\naddress this determination and all outstanding issues relating to\r\nboth decrees.\r\nThis litigation, now in its twenty-seventh year, involving\r\nhalf a dozen district judges, magistrate judges, and many\r\nconferences, hearings briefings, and appeals, has accomplished much\r\nin a troubled and complex field of custody and treatment of\r\ninstitutionalized sexually dangerous persons.  During this period,\r\nchanges have occurred in conditions of confinement and treatment,\r\nin the problems confronted, and in the institutional setting. \r\nAfter exhaustive briefings and argument from capable counsel, we\r\nconclude that the district court acted sensitively and\r\nappropriately in conducting the proceedings below, upholding the\r\nproposed modifications of both the Original Decree and the\r\nSupplemental Decree, and signaling its readiness to exercise its\r\noversight when occasion warrants.  While we cannot expect \"closure\"\r\nof tensions and problems, we may hope for problems of smaller\r\ndimension capable of systematic resolution without the necessity of\r\nheroic effort.\r\nWe first address several issues relating to the Original\r\nDecree.\r\n                I.     The Original Decree.\r\nA.  Denial of Discovery and Evidentiary Hearing.\r\nPlaintiffs repeatedly requested the opportunity to engage in\r\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing.  They sought to discern\r\nwhether DOC intended to provide \"meaningful treatment under the\r\nPlan\" and whether its treatment plan was consistent with the \"least\r\nrestrictive conditions\" requirement of the Original Decree. \r\nPlaintiffs proposed accomplishing this by exploring DOC's past\r\nbehavior, present behavior, and expressions of future intent. \r\nPlaintiffs' proposal contemplates interviews with all residents,\r\nexamination of new procedures, expert testimony interpreting the\r\nPlan, investigation of current practices, inquiry into internal\r\nmemos relating to the Plan and the persons instrumental in\r\nformulating it, and depositions of DOC officials and Joint Resource\r\nInstitute (JRI) personnel responsible for treatment.  As much as\r\nsix months of time would be needed.\r\nThe basic response of the court in denying discovery requests\r\nwas:\r\nIt may be that the plan won't work, but the Court of\r\nAppeals . . . [told me not to] prejudge the plan, but\r\nthey told me . . . I should have a hearing, inquire into\r\nthe DOC plan, giving significant weight to the local\r\ngovernment.\r\n                     *     *     *\r\n. . . [W]hat would DOC do under this plan?  And then I\r\nshould use my judicial oversight, primarily rely on my\r\njudicial oversight, to insure that the DOC is complying\r\nwith the decrees.  So it seems to me that that's a very\r\nclear blueprint.\r\n\nThis was an accurate precis of our directives \"to give\r\nsignificant weight to the views of local government officials\" and\r\nto \"rely primarily on its jurisdictional oversight to ensure DOC's\r\ncompliance with the decrees.\"  King I, 52 F.3d at 7.  Moreover,\r\neven absent these directives, a trial court is vested with broad\r\ndiscretion in granting or denying discovery.  8 Charles A. Wright\r\net al., Federal Practice and Procedure   2006, at 91 (1994). \r\nThe task of the district court, following our directives, was\r\nto determine whether DOC, which had been given authority under\r\nstate law, was likely to manage the Center without doing violence\r\nto the substantive portions of the Original Decree.  In the words\r\nof the Special Master appointed by the court, the inquiry being\r\nundertaken was \"whether DOC is approaching the control of the\r\ninstitution with a treatment modality.\"\r\nIn support of its proposal for extensive discovery and\r\nhearing, plaintiffs relied principally on the extensive procedure\r\nwhich the trial judge adopted on remand in Inmates of the Suffolk\r\nCounty Jail v. Rufo, 844 F. Supp. 31 (D. Mass. 1994).  But it does\r\nnot follow from the fact that a judge allowed discovery and\r\nevidentiary hearing in one case that a denial of discovery in a\r\ndifferent case is an abuse of discretion.\r\nAppellants' basic interest in discovery was to elicit views\r\nand evidence of DOC's sincerity.  To test the viability of this\r\ngoal in the particular posture in which the district court found\r\nitself, we venture the following scenario.  Assume that a number of\r\nwitnesses testified in deposition or at a hearing that DOC\r\nofficials were insincere and had no intention of carrying out the\r\nPlan as written.  If the court found the witnesses credible, would\r\nit then deny DOC's request to modify?  The consequence would be\r\nthat the Center would then revert to the earlier dual management,\r\ndespite the passage of Chapter 489.  Or, would the court craft, as\r\namicus argued, its own solution, substituting the Clinical Director\r\nfor DOC, creating the bizarre situation of an employee of an entity\r\nunder contract with DOC holding powers denied to DOC?  In either\r\ncase DOC would have no future opportunity to demonstrate its\r\nfitness to manage.\r\nIt seems clear to us that had the court pursued either course,\r\nit would not have accorded \"significant weight to the views of\r\nlocal government officials.\"  Indeed, it would have rejected them\r\nin their entirety on the ground of insincerity.  This would violate\r\nnot only our guidance but that of the Supreme Court in Rufo, 502\r\nU.S. at 392 n.14.  It would also violate our directive to rely\r\nprimarily on continuing oversight.\r\nWe think it therefore reasonable, at the proposed\r\nmodifications stage, that the district court declined to allow an\r\nextensive investigation as to whether DOC was acting in good faith. \r\nWe are not saying that the court would have abused its discretion\r\nhad it chosen to allow some kind of discovery and evidentiary\r\nhearing, but certainly it did not abuse its broad discretion in\r\ndenying such.\r\nB.  Delayed Appointment of Counsel.\r\nAmong the interests represented in the cluster of lawsuits now\r\ncollected under the King v. Greenblatt tent are those raised in\r\nWilliams v. Lesiak, 822 F.2d 1223 (1st Cir. 1987).  In that case,\r\nthe plaintiffs had focused on treatment issues at the Center,\r\nparticularly the absence or inferior quality of work, job training,\r\nand educational programs.  On May 27, 1994, the district court\r\nreopened Williams and consolidated it with King.  Although the\r\nremaining Williams plaintiffs requested counsel on a number of\r\noccasions, counsel was not appointed for them until August 17,\r\n1995.  This delay, they contend, constituted an abuse of discretion\r\nand is reason for reversal.\r\nHere again the review threshold is high.  This being a civil\r\ncase, there is no constitutional right to counsel and the statutory\r\nauthority, 28 U.S.C.  1915, is discretionary.  See Cookish v.\r\nCunningham, 787 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1986).  Moreover, we may find\r\nreversible error only if \"exceptional circumstances were present\r\nsuch that a denial of counsel was likely to result in fundamental\r\nunfairness impinging on [plaintiffs'] due process rights.\" \r\nDesRosiers v. Moran, 949 F.2d 15, 23 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nOur review of the evaluation of this complex and multi-faceted\r\nlitigation during the fifteen months of delay reveals court actions\r\nwhich manifested a sensitivity to the interests of Williamsplaintiffs and a total absence of recognizable unfairness.  The\r\nfirst stage during this period began on May 27, 1994, with the\r\nreopening of Williams and the court's denial of the Commonwealth's\r\nmotion to modify the Original Decree.  At this time the court,\r\nhaving recently appointed counsel for a different group of patients\r\nintervening in King, the \"Class of 48 + 1,\" expressed the hope that\r\nsuch counsel would \"look at the global picture.\"  The court also\r\nindicated that it might look for another person who would represent\r\nonly the Williams plaintiffs.  In December 1994, appointed counsel\r\nfor the \"Class of 48 + 1\" plaintiffs informed a Williams party that\r\nhe was not representing his interests.  From this time, therefore,\r\nuntil August 17, 1995, the Williams plaintiffs knew they were\r\nunrepresented.\r\nAny lack of representation during this period, however, was\r\nwithout any practical effect.  As the district court denied the\r\nCommonwealth's motion to modify at the hearing on May 27, 1994, the\r\nWilliams plaintiffs suffered no disadvantage at that time.  We did\r\nnot issue an opinion on the Commonwealth's appeal of that denial\r\nuntil April 6, 1995.  The appeal concentrated on the significance\r\nof the enactment of Chapter 489, and did not raise any Williamsissue.  Our opinion, after holding that the statute had indeed\r\nconstituted a significant change of law, meeting Rufo's first\r\nprong, simply remanded the case to the district court to consider\r\nwhether the second Rufo prong had been met.  Again, there was no\r\nopportunity for harm to the Williams plaintiffs' interests in the\r\nappeal.  In the interim period between the denial of the motion to\r\nmodify and our decision on the appeal, DOC submitted its Management\r\nPlan for the Administration of the Treatment Center (Plan), views\r\nwere exchanged between a Special Master and DOC, and settlement\r\ndiscussions took place.  These discussions generally resulted in an\r\nimpasse.  Moreover, during much of this time, the interests of all\r\nresidents were identical, since the original motion to modify\r\nsought only a change in administrative control.  \r\nIn May 1995, the court denied discovery, see supra, resolving\r\nto confine its efforts to a close scrutiny of the Plan itself. \r\nThus, neither side was allowed to investigate or receive additional\r\ndocumentation on or deposition of the other.  And although on\r\nNovember 11, 1994, the Commonwealth filed a renewed motion to\r\nmodify, seeking a change in the Supplemental Decree, no action was\r\ntaken by the district court until June 29, 1995.  At that time, the\r\ndistrict court granted the renewed motion, but it also stayed four\r\nimportant parts of the Plan, including the Community Access Plan\r\n(CAP), involving issues prominent in Williams.  Six weeks later, on\r\nAugust 17, 1995   before any action was taken on the stayed\r\nprovisions of the Plan, or on any other area concerning which the\r\nWilliams plaintiffs had expressed concern   counsel was appointed. \r\nOn this record, not only have counsel been unable to point to\r\nany prejudice stemming from the delay in appointing counsel for the \r\nWilliams plaintiffs, but we see no possibility, as the case\r\nprogressed through its various stages, of any prejudice or \r\n\"fundamental unfairness.\"  We are satisfied that their interests\r\nwere adequately protected by the appointment of counsel in August\r\n1995.\r\nC.  \"Suitable Tailoring\" of Modifications.\r\nThe second prong of Rufo requires that a consent decree be\r\nchanged no more than necessary to resolve the problems created by\r\nthe change of circumstances.  The proposed modifications must not\r\ndefeat the core purpose of the consent decree nor, of course,\r\ncreate a constitutional violation.  See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391-92.\r\nSuperficially, one might say that the changed circumstance is\r\nsimply the vesting of all authority over the Center in DOC and that\r\nthe proposed modifications for the Original Decree merely parrot\r\nChapter 489 by substituting DOC for joint mention of DOC and DMH. \r\nSuch a literal approach, however, obscures the reality that the\r\nMassachusetts legislature, in vesting unitary control in DOC, was\r\nalso recognizing that DOC's views of the policies best suited to\r\nbalance the two objectives of the Center   effective treatment of\r\nthe sexually dangerous persons and the security and safety of the\r\npatient/inmate and the population as a whole   differed from those\r\nwhich had guided DMH during much of the previous quarter of a\r\ncentury.  Legislative emphasis on the goal of security and safety\r\nis evidenced by the addition of \"custody\" in the Chapter 489\r\namendment to the previous formulation of goals in Mass. Gen. Laws.\r\nch. 123A  2 of \"care, treatment and rehabilitation.\"  Accordingly,\r\nthe change in control contemplated change in operations and\r\nembraced the grant of some degree of flexibility and initiative to\r\nDOC.\r\nSimilarly, the proposed modifications cannot be limited to the\r\nsimple change in authority, since, as we have just noted, that\r\nchange is inevitably overlaid with some expectation of change in\r\nsome policies and practices.  This does not mean that DOC has carte\r\nblanche to do anything it wishes, for the Original Decree remains\r\nunmodified in its requirement that \"patients at the Treatment\r\nCenter should have the least restrictive conditions necessary to\r\nachieve the purposes of commitment.\"  \r\nThis provision is the substantive essence of the Original\r\nDecree.  The decree does not embrace all the policies and practices\r\nthat have been relied on in the past by DMH to achieve effective\r\ntreatment under the least restrictive conditions.  By the same\r\ntoken, as the district court realized, the \"proposed modifications\"\r\nare not the host of provisions in the 138-page Plan, which simply\r\nsets forth ways in which DOC aspires to fulfill the requirements of\r\nthe Original Decree.\r\nThe task of conducting a \"suitable tailoring\" analysis\r\ntherefore requires trying to determine if the basic thrust of the\r\nnew authority is likely to violate \"least restrictive conditions\"\r\nor constitutional requirements.  While the Commonwealth has the\r\nburden to demonstrate \"suitable tailoring,\" we have also instructed\r\nthe district court, as we have noted, to give significant weight to\r\nthe views of local officials and to rely \"primarily\" on continuing\r\njudicial oversight to rectify violations.  King I, 52 F.3d at 7. \r\nAccordingly, unless a demonstrably inadequate or erroneous policy\r\nundercutting the Original Decree appears from an anticipatory\r\nscrutiny of the Plan, DOC should be allowed to proceed.\r\nThe district court had before it not only the Plan but two\r\nvolumes of appendices, exhibits, and affidavits, comments from the\r\nplaintiffs and the Special Master, and responses by DOC.  The Plan\r\nhas seven sections:  (1) management and staffing; (2) clinical\r\ntreatment program; (3) educational and vocational treatment; (4)\r\nbehavior management; (5) resident management and operations; (6)\r\nCAP; and (7) integration of the Center with the prison program for\r\nsex offenders.  The district court reviewed in some detail behavior\r\nmanagement provisions (specifically, the Behavior Review Committee,\r\nthe Minimum Privilege Unit, and Transfer Board policies), CAP, and\r\nresident management and operations (specifically, the restriction\r\nof privileges).\r\nThe court found that the Plan was \"a permissible and detailed\r\nproposal\" addressing both the increased emphasis on security and\r\ntreatment concerns.  With respect to security, the court stated,\r\n\"security concerns in the Treatment Center have always been viewed\r\nas legitimate.\"  As to treatment, the court took note of the fact\r\nthat treatment was to be provided by JRI, which had been under\r\ncontract with DMH since 1992, and that its employee, Dr. Barbara\r\nSchwartz, the Center's Treatment Director, affirmed that DOC would\r\nretain the clinical, educational, vocational and rehabilitation\r\nprograms initiated by JRI.  It therefore approved the proposed\r\nmodifications, concluding that the Plan \"appears to properly\r\nbalance the competing goals of treatment and security and\r\nadequately protects the rights of the residents.\"     \r\nThe court refused, however, to vacate the Decrees, as the\r\nCommonwealth requested, stating:\r\nWhile the Plan details the provision of treatment and the\r\nability of DOC to address security concerns, at bottom,\r\nthe potential for conflict between these interests\r\ncontinues to exist.  The confusing and conflicting roles\r\nof DMH and DOC have been resolved.  It is DOC's sole\r\nresponsibility to provide treatment in a secure setting. \r\nThe Plan provides them with the rules to accomplish this. \r\nThe Plan does not, and no plan can, provide the\r\nwillingness and commitment in doing so.\r\n\nThus recognizing that only future performance would administer the\r\nPlan in harmony with the essence of the Decrees, the court denied\r\nthe motion to vacate without prejudice to review it for one year;\r\nfollowing that period, during which the court would monitor Plan\r\nimplementation, it would reconsider the motion.\r\nOn appeal, appellants first level the general charge that DOC\r\n\"has essentially turned the Treatment Center into a prison and\r\nfundamentally altered the therapeutic community.\"  It is, of\r\ncourse, true that the added emphasis on security and safety,\r\ntogether with a new approach to behavior management, featuring\r\ndefinite sanctions for defined unacceptable behavior, will\r\ninevitably effect some retreat from a more permissive atmosphere. \r\nBut appellants' sweeping condemnation cannot stand without more\r\nprecise identification of serious defects in the many provisions\r\nregarding varieties of treatment, the extent of clinical\r\nsupervision, and the safeguards of individual rights.\r\nAppellants turn specifically to four areas.  The first is CAP,\r\nwhere the participants have shrunk from fifty-six in 1988 to two in\r\n1997.  They also criticize the application process that must be\r\ncompleted by an patient/inmate before being accepted for release\r\ninto the community.  Under the Plan, the patient/inmate must\r\ninitiate his own program proposal, then must face review with the\r\nprospect that, if once denied acceptance, he must begin again after\r\na six month delay.  Appellants also say that the Community Access\r\nBoard should, under Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307 (1982), be\r\nentirely composed of clinicians.\r\nThe Plan devotes some forty-four pages to CAP.  This has\r\nobviously been a subject of intense rethinking.  Under a change in\r\nthe statute, a resident is no longer eligible for participation if\r\nhe is still serving a sentence; he must now have completed serving\r\nany criminal sentence.  The introductory section observes that the\r\nprior policies did not adequately emphasize public safety and\r\nstates, \"Recent events and improvements in the understanding of\r\nboth the dynamics of sexual offenses and the realistic objectives\r\nfor treatment, as well as legislative change to Chapter 123A, have\r\nlead [sic] to the development of a revised program.\"  The Plan\r\nadopts a cautious approach which recognizes that \"sexually\r\ndangerous persons\" will \"never cease to be 'at risk.'\"\r\nAccordingly, whereas access to the community had earlier been\r\napproved prior to the designing of a program, careful, even\r\nmeticulous, planning must now precede approval of access.  The\r\nprocess of plan review and approval is indeed a daunting,\r\nattenuated one.  But we cannot at this juncture rule the new\r\nprogram out of bounds.  In this most sensitive area of tension\r\nbetween safety and treatment, and between the individual and the\r\ncommunity, we cannot say that CAP is not the least restrictive\r\nfeasible response.\r\nThe shrinkage in numbers of participants must be viewed\r\nagainst the background that a substantial number of residents, many\r\nof whom are serving very lengthy sentences, simply refuse to\r\nparticipate in or apply to treatment programs.  Moreover, a JRI\r\nanalysis reveals that in 1996, three of the ninety-one eligible\r\nresidents of a total population of 202 submitted applications and\r\nproposed plans.  As of January 1997, two remained in the program\r\nwhile twelve resided in the less restrictive Community Transition\r\nHouse in a \"pre-transition\" program.  This does not, in our opinion,\r\npoint to any obvious constitutional failure.  Further adjudication\r\nwill have to await events.\r\nAs for the Youngberg argument that the entire Community Access\r\nBoard should consist of clinicians, we refer to our discussion,\r\ninfra, in relation to a similar criticism of decision making in the\r\nbehavior management area.  \r\nAnother area of specific criticism is the Transfer Board and\r\nits policies.  The Transfer Board is a creation of Chapter 489,\r\nenacting a new section 2A of Chapter 123, which provides that a\r\nresident who is serving under an unexpired criminal sentence may be\r\ntransferred from the Center to a correctional institution.  The\r\nfactors that may be considered are \"unamenability to treatment,\"\r\n\"unwillingness to follow treatment recommendations, lack of\r\nprogress in treatment, danger to other residents or staff, [and]\r\nsecurity.\"  Appellants say the policies fail to identify treatment\r\nand the criteria for \"unamenability of treatment.\"  They also\r\ncontend that the Board is insufficiently clinical in composition,\r\nand that there are no criteria defining when a patient may be\r\neligible for return to the Center.  \r\nWe preface our consideration of appellants' contentions by\r\nrecalling the basic rationale that prompted the new statutory\r\nprovisions.  As Dr. Schwartz explained in her affidavit, the\r\nearlier transfer provisions allowed transfer only for threat of\r\nharm or escape.  She observed that some residents refuse treatment;\r\nthey \"cannot profit from treatment simply because of the length of\r\ntheir underlying sentences.\"  Instead of these residents occupying\r\nlimited places at the Center, it makes \"far more sense\" to allow\r\n\"new and motivated admissions.\"\r\nWe find adequate assurances of treatment.  In the first place,\r\nthe Plan indicates that in placing a resident, the classification\r\nprocess will attempt to identify an institution where sex offender\r\ntreatment is available.  Additionally, the statute itself states\r\nthat DOC \"shall make available a program of voluntary treatment\r\nservices.\"  Finally, a member of the Center's treatment team will\r\nbe liaison to prison staff.  As for vagueness of \"amenability\" and\r\n\"security,\" regulations have fleshed out the terms, the former being\r\ndefined as failure to participate or make progress in six months\r\nand the latter as consisting of danger of physical harm to others\r\nmanifested through threats or assaults.\r\nWith respect to appellants' claim that the criteria for return\r\nto the Center are undefined, we think that the Plan properly\r\naddresses the need for criteria.  It specifically contemplates the\r\nestablishment of guidelines, stating, \"the Transfer Board will\r\nsuggest minimum criteria for consideration of the resident's future\r\nreturn to the Treatment Center.\"  The provision charges those\r\npersons responsible for transferring inmates to the Center   and\r\ntherefore those persons most knowledgeable about the risks and\r\nresponsibilities accompanying the return of inmates   with\r\ndetermining how best to accommodate the needs of the inmates, the\r\nCenter and DOC.  \r\nWe have also reviewed appellants' arguments that the transfer\r\npolicies violated due process, double jeopardy and the ex post\r\nfacto clause.  The first claim is based on the assumption, which we\r\nhave stated is unfounded, that suitable treatment will not be\r\navailable to any transferred resident.  The last claims rest on the\r\nassumption that a transferred resident will suffer a belated\r\nincrease in his sentence.  We find it unnecessary to elaborate on\r\nthe district court's opinion resolving these issues as we are\r\nsatisfied with the judge's analysis and conclusion that, on the\r\nrecord before him, there was no evidence of such increase.  \r\nWith respect to clinical participation, the district court\r\nnoted in its opinion that\r\nThe Commonwealth has agreed to modify the composition of\r\nthe Board so that the Clinical Director of Treatment, the\r\nDeputy Superintendent of Programs and the Director of\r\nSecurity will be equally represented . . . . In other\r\nwords, the decision will be made by a vote of the\r\nprofessionals charged with the operation of the Treatment\r\nCenter.\r\n\nAppellants continue to assert that the only \"professionals\" who\r\ncould fulfill the requirement of Youngberg are mental health\r\nprofessionals.  We discuss this issue in the following paragraphs\r\ninvolving behavior management.  Our conclusion is equally\r\napplicable to the Community Access Board and the Transfer Board.  \r\nAn appropriate place to start our analysis of the behavior\r\nmanagement component of the Plan is to examine appellants'\r\ncriticism of the manner of imposing sanctions.  We note that this\r\ncriticism is levied at the Original Decree and is to be\r\ndistinguished from the substance, punishment and sequestration,\r\nwhich are proscribed by the Supplemental Decree.  \r\nThe controlling document, 103 MTC 430A, \"Observation of\r\nBehavior Reports,\" sets forth the Center's disciplinary system,\r\nincluding a \"clear set of rules\" and a \"clear set of sanctions.\"  The\r\nmonitoring and enforcing body is the Behavior Review Committee. \r\nAppointed by the Superintendent, it consists of one security staff\r\nmember, one clinician and one JRI staff member.  This committee\r\ndeals with violations meriting such sanctions as warnings, and\r\nroom, unit, work, and visitation restrictions.  In addition, the\r\nSuperintendent has the authority to impose sequestration awaiting\r\nhearing, investigation, prosecution or a transfer hearing in\r\ninstances where the resident has threatened, attempted, or\r\ninflicted serious harm on others.  \r\nAppellants contend that such decisions violate the teaching of\r\nYoungberg that only qualified professionals should make treatment\r\ndecisions regarding involuntarily committed individuals.  We begin\r\nby noting, as we did in Cameron v. Tomes, 990 F.2d 14 (1993), that\r\nYoungberg was a \"cautiously phrased decision,\" directed to the right\r\nof a mentally retarded inmate to \"minimally adequate . . . training\r\nto ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint.\"  Id. at 18\r\n(citing Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 319).  Moreover, the Court in\r\nYoungberg gave a rather flexible, context-related definition of\r\nwhat it meant by \"professional\":  \"a person competent, whether by\r\neducation, training or experience, to make the particular decision\r\nat issue.\"  457 U.S. at 323 n.30.  It added the circumscribed\r\ncaveat that \"[l]ong-term treatment decisions normally should be\r\nmade by persons with degrees in medicine or nursing, or with\r\nappropriate training in such areas as psychology . . . .\"  Id. \r\nUnlike in Youngberg, what is at issue here is not long term\r\ntreatment decisions but short term disciplinary decisions.  We look\r\nin our analysis to the guidance we deliberately gave, in Cameron,\r\nfor the future application of the concept of professionals and to\r\nthe role of administrators:\r\nAny professional judgment that decides an issue involving\r\nconditions of confinement must embrace security and\r\nadministration, and not merely medical judgments. . . .\r\nThe administrators are responsible to the state and to\r\nthe public for making professional judgments of their\r\nown, encompassing institutional concerns as well as\r\nindividual welfare.\r\n\n990 F.2d at 20.\r\nIn this case, the disciplinary system is responsive to both\r\nthe \"treatment\" need of residents to learn accountability for their\r\nactions and the administrative and security concerns of the\r\ninstitution.  The composition of the Behavior Review Committee,\r\nwith one DMH professional, and one security-minded member from DOC,\r\nand one JRI person with overall treatment program responsibility\r\nseems well suited to the mix of concerns involved in sequestration\r\ndecisions.  Indeed, if mental health professionals were to control\r\nall decisions, certainty and regularity of sanction imposition\r\nwould necessarily be swallowed up by ad hoc individualized decision\r\nmaking.  We know of no case authority that would declare the\r\ndecision process in applying sanctions described in the Plan\r\nfacially constitutionally defective.  We decline the invitation to\r\nextend Youngberg anticipatorily to this case.\r\nThe authority to sequester \"awaiting action\" wielded by the\r\nSuperintendent implicates procedural concerns.  The district court\r\nwas sensitive to these concerns and required DOC to give the due\r\nprocess protections of written notice of reasons for placement and\r\nopportunity to respond required by Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460,\r\n471 (1983), in cases of administrative segregation.  The court, in\r\nso doing, acknowledged that its action stemmed from its recognition\r\nthat residents, unlike the prison inmate in Assandin v. Corner, 115\r\nS. Ct. 2293 (1995), were entitled to due process protections. \r\nAgain, on this record we are not prepared to declare any breach of\r\nprocedural due process.\r\nA final target of the criticism is in the area of resident\r\nmanagement and operations.  Appellants protest a number of\r\nprivileges which have been truncated.  These involve the amount of\r\nclothing allowed to be kept by a patient, the amount of funds, and\r\nthe number of room visits, telephone calls, stamps, credit cards,\r\netc.  The Plan justifies some reduction in these privileges because\r\nof past experiences with security, assault, gambling, coercion, and\r\ninterruptions in treatment.  No reduction rises to the level of a\r\nconstitutional infraction.\r\nWhen all the smoke has cleared, the legislatively ordered\r\nchange in command and the directions which it proposes to take do\r\nnot exceed the reasonable latitude implicit in the legislative\r\nchange of command.  Nor does either appear likely to undermine the\r\nOriginal Decree or to violate the Constitution.\r\n\n                II.  The Supplemental Decree.\r\nA.   Modification.\r\n While modification of the Original Decree involved mainly a\r\nchange from dual control to exclusive DOC management of the Center,\r\nthe Supplemental Decree and any modifications proposed were\r\nsubstantive.  The Supplemental Decree barred solitary confinement\r\nfor punishment, \"disciplinary and punitive procedures having no\r\nplace in the care and treatment of civilly committed patients.\" \r\nThe requested modifications would strike the general proscription\r\nof disciplinary and punishment procedures and link solitary\r\nconfinement to the offense underlying the original commitment of\r\nthe individual.\r\n In King II, we were not persuaded that the mere change in\r\ncontrol implicated this substantive change.  We therefore remanded\r\nthe question of justification for modification and left it to the\r\ndistrict court to decide whether further factual development or\r\nopinion evidence was needed.  The court decided that it did not\r\nrequire an evidentiary hearing and scheduled a prompt submission of\r\nbriefs and a hearing for presentation of views.  Appellants\r\nsubmitted several affidavits, and appellees rested on the record. \r\nThe court ruled that a significant change in fact had occurred,\r\nbased on examination of the Plan and monthly DOC reports which\r\nverified DOC's adherence to the Plan, a visit to the Center with\r\ncounsel, discussion with the residents at the Center, and review of \r\nopinions of the qualified professional in charge of the\r\nadministration of the Plan, Dr. Schwartz.  The court also stated\r\nthat the dramatically changed conditions of segregation that had\r\ntaken place since 1972 constituted a relevant added factual\r\ndevelopment.\r\n We agree with the district court but would add another factual\r\ndevelopment called for by our scrutiny of the record, namely, a\r\nsignificant change in the philosophical approach to treatment of\r\ncivilly committed sex offenders in programs operated by\r\ncorrectional departments.  We do not mean that there has been a\r\ncomplete reversal of position under all circumstances from the\r\nearlier, more permissive mental health approach to the more\r\nrestrictive behavior control approach.  But the monolithic\r\nacceptance of the mental health approach that existed a quarter of\r\na century ago has yielded to the acknowledgment that there is no\r\nroyal road to treatment and cure.  Behavioral control programs\r\nincluding defined offenses and sanctions are now featured in\r\ninstitutions operated by corrections personnel.\r\n We begin with the 1989 report of the Governor's Special\r\nAdvisory Panel on Forensic Mental Health, which preceded the\r\npassage in 1994 of Chapter 489.  We do not rely on opinions\r\nexpressed by that Panel, but on some factual statements which have\r\nnever been impugned.  Indicative of some kind of sea change is that\r\nmost of the thirty-one states that had \"special dispositional\r\nprovisions\" for sex offenders, i.e., indefinite commitments as in\r\nMassachusetts, repealed or significantly reformed the statutes. \r\nRepeal was recommended by the American Bar Association in its 1984\r\nproposed Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards on the ground\r\nthat, inter alia, the assumption that mental disability underlay\r\nsexual offenses in general was no longer viewed as clinically\r\nvalid.  A 1977 report of the American Psychiatry Association to the\r\nsame effect was cited. \r\n Dr. Roger Smith, the impressively credentialed Director of\r\nMichigan's Bureau of Forensic Mental Health, narrowed the focus to\r\nprograms run by correctional personnel.  In 1994, he evaluated the\r\nMassachusetts DOC Plan.  In an affidavit, he made the point that in\r\ninstitutions where civilly committed residents and corrections\r\ninmates are lodged and treated, \"[E]very attempt must be made to\r\napply program rules, and sanctions for violation of such rules, in\r\na uniform and fair manner, and to avoid the perception (or reality)\r\nthat civilly committed residents have privileges and rights which\r\nexceed those of their DOC peers.\"  In states that have opted to\r\ntreat sex offenders only in the months prior to parole release, he\r\nadded, programs generally are provided in minimum security\r\nsettings.  As for DOC's Plan, \"[t]he establishment of clear rules\r\nand sanctions for rule violations by residents is clearly long\r\noverdue, and essential to effective management of the therapeutic\r\nprogram.\"  He also found the restrictions on residents' privileges,\r\nsuch as visits and mail, to be \"consistent with standards found in\r\ncorrectional treatment programs nationwide.\"\r\n To this we add the unrebutted factual assertions of Dr.\r\nSchwartz, who is a JRI employee and the Clinical Director of the\r\nCenter.  Having trained staff from most of the prison-based sex\r\noffender treatment programs, she made the unqualified statement:\r\n\"Every sex offender program in the country which is operated by a\r\ncorrections department adheres to the disciplinary policy of the\r\ninstitution.\"\r\n These affidavits were filed with the court in November 1994. \r\nOnly after remand did appellants seek to counter such statements in\r\nany way.  In 1997, appellants filed affidavits of clinical\r\ndirectors of treatment programs in Kansas and Washington.  These \r\nprograms were run by a department of Social and Rehabilitation\r\nServices or of Social and Health Services and were available only\r\nto persons soon to finish serving their sentences or without\r\ncriminal sentences, whose release depended solely on their ability\r\nto control their conduct.  It is understandable that in Kansas\r\nsequestration for a period in excess of fifty-nine minutes was\r\nrare, and that in Washington there had been only one occasion in\r\nthirteen months to keep an inmate in a \"quiet room\" for up to four\r\nhours.  Clearly, the populations and the problems were quite\r\ndifferent from those in the Center.  Appellants also submitted a\r\ndraft of a proposed patients' handbook from Wisconsin, but although\r\nsome twenty-two definitions of \"major misconduct\" were set forth,\r\nthe Appendix we were furnished did not contain standards for either\r\nincapacitation measures or deterrent sanctions.  The program,\r\nunlike that we consider here, was confined to those who were only\r\ncivilly committed.  We view appellants' submissions concerning\r\nother states' civil-commitments-only programs as essentially\r\ncomparing oranges to appellees' apples.  \r\n Finally, appellants attempt to demonstrate that there has been\r\nno change in basic treatment philosophy by submitting a 1972 policy\r\nstatement by Dr. Harry Kozol, then Director of the Center, who did\r\nnot attribute his policy eschewing punishment to a mental illness\r\ntheory but rather to a view of self-discipline and personal\r\naccountability as focal patient goals.  Any similarity with the\r\npresent treatment philosophy stops at this point.  For Dr. Kozol\r\nwent on to describe the process of enforcing accountability: when\r\na patient was found to have engaged in \"antisocial and\r\ninappropriate behavior,\" a clinical study would be made of steps\r\nneeded to be taken, which could include, not segregation, but\r\n\"exclusion from the population and placement in the Special\r\nIntensive Treatment Unit.\"  This was, he stated, not looked upon as\r\n\"lock-up\" but, \"[i]n operation, this program has excluded patients\r\nfrom the general population for considerably longer periods than\r\npatients . . . were excluded in lock-up by the correctional\r\nauthority here.\"  We think it clear that this system   lacking\r\ndefinitions of \"antisocial and inappropriate behavior,\" and with\r\nsanctions that vary according to the clinical analysis,\r\nindeterminate sequestration, and release that depends on \"our\r\nclinical judgment that the risk of his acting offensively and\r\ninappropriately is reduced to a reasonable or substantial [sic]\r\nlevel\"   differs significantly from the Plan's approach. \r\n The factual assertions of the Special Advisory Panel and Dr.\r\nSchwartz, together with the observations of Michigan's Dr. Smith,\r\nlead us to accept as a significant change of fact the adoption of\r\na new treatment approach to sex offender treatment programs\r\nconducted by corrections departments.  Our survey of this record\r\nalso convinces us that the court did not err in not delaying its\r\nconsideration pending further discovery.  Appellants' request in\r\ntheir Joint Submission Concerning Supplemental Decree was couched\r\nin the alternative.  In the event that the court did not deny the\r\nmotion to modify the Supplemental Decree, they wished discovery,\r\nciting as their only objective, \"the deposition of defendants'\r\nwitnesses.\"  What we said in connection with the refusal to extend\r\ndiscovery relating to the Original Decree applies here.  We see\r\nlittle fruitful prospect in such proceedings; the court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in refusing such a request.\r\n The district court suitably relied on the Plan, its visit to\r\nthe Center, its talks with residents who did not complain about\r\ndiscipline, punishment, or conditions in the Minimum Privilege\r\nUnit, and on the opinion of Dr. Schwartz who averred, \"I consider\r\nthe institution of a disciplinary policy containing clearly defined\r\noffenses carrying definitive sanctions as an essential part of a\r\nstate-of-the-art treatment program.\" The court added that since\r\npunishment was clearly contemplated, \"it follows that appropriate\r\npunishment may include sequestration of some kind.\"  This last\r\nproposition may not be self evident.  We therefore elaborate.\r\n A reading of the Code of Offenses and list of sanctions\r\nsuggests to us the essentiality of sequestration to this Plan. \r\nThere are fifty-nine offenses divided among four categories.  There\r\nare eleven offenses described in the category of the greatest\r\nseverity, such as killing, rape, arson, and taking hostages.  In\r\nthe high category are seventeen offenses, including assault,\r\nbringing in illegal drugs, demanding protection money, and\r\ncounterfeiting.  The nineteen offenses in the moderate category\r\ninclude refusing a direct order, lying to a staff member, and\r\nthreatening another person.  The low category consists of twelve\r\noffenses, ranging from use of obscene language and unexcused\r\nabsences, to failure to follow safety regulations.\r\n In like manner, the sanctions vary both according to category\r\nand to whether the offense is accompanied by mitigating or\r\naggravating circumstances   or neither.  The most severe sanction\r\nis placement in the Minimum Privilege Unit for thirty days for a\r\nsevere offense accompanied by aggravating circumstances.  Other\r\nsanctions available for severe offenses include loss of privileges\r\nfrom sixty to eighty days, restitution, forfeiture of good time,\r\nrestitution, and loss of job.  The maximum sanction for a high\r\noffense, with  aggravating circumstances, is placement in the\r\nMinimum Privilege Unit for five days with a lesser alternative\r\nbeing room restriction for ten days, and, like a severe offense,\r\nrestitution, loss of privileges, good time, and job.  \r\n It is obvious that, if placement in the Minimum Privilege Unit\r\nwere not available as a sanction, the range of sanctions would be\r\nso telescoped and compressed that a resident could not expect much\r\nmore severe treatment for a high or severe offense than for a\r\nmoderate offense.  For example, a resident who had taken hostages\r\nmight lose some privileges for eighty days while a resident who\r\nrefused an order might lose some privileges for five days.  The\r\ndisparity between offenses far exceeds the disparity in sanctions\r\nthat could be imposed.  We therefore also conclude that\r\nsequestration is an integral part of the Plan's system of graduated\r\nand defined offenses and sanctions.\r\n Finally, we cannot fault the court for relying on the \"vastly\r\ndifferent\" conditions of confinement in the Minimum Privilege Unit\r\ntoday compared to those described in the King complaint.  King,\r\nplaced in solitary confinement without procedural safeguards for\r\ncalling a guard a \"dingbat,\" was placed in a six by nine foot cell,\r\nwithout a sink, only a portable chamber pot, no facilities for\r\ndrinking water, no reading or writing materials, no visits   not\r\neven from his parents   no radio or exercise . . . and filthy walls\r\nand floor.  \r\n The Minimum Privilege Unit, on the other hand, is a new\r\nbuilding constructed in 1986, with rooms eight by sixteen feet,\r\nwith toilet and sink.  Residents are allowed access to telephone,\r\nvisitors, exercise periods, daily showers, canteen, and library. \r\nThe regulations, 103 MTC423.07, provide that residents in the\r\nMinimum Privilege Unit will be accorded treatment by their regular\r\ntreatment team, unless some modification is dictated by safety and\r\nsecurity.  Additional or supplemental treatment \"will be provided\r\nas necessary.\"\r\n We are fully satisfied that this combination of a difference\r\nin basic approaches, a detailed Plan maintaining treatment\r\nstandards accompanied by a detailed disciplinary system, and\r\ndramatic changes in conditions of confinement amounts to the\r\nsignificant change in facts required by Rufo.\r\n As for the second prong, \"suitable tailoring,\" there is little\r\nneed for lengthy discussion.  The Plan preserves clinical treatment\r\nprograms and procedural safeguards.  Its departures from the\r\nSupplemental Decree, inaugurating a disciplinary system and\r\noutlining procedures for charging, deciding, and reviewing\r\ninfractions seem well within reasonable requirements.  The major\r\narea of difference, the Plan's provision for sequestration, reveals\r\na restrained resort to this sanction.  Placement in the Minimum\r\nPrivilege Unit is allowed under only four circumstances: commission\r\nof a severe offense with aggravating circumstances (up to thirty\r\ndays); a severe offense without either aggravating or mitigating\r\ncircumstances (up to twenty days); a severe offense under\r\nmitigating circumstances (up to ten days); and a high offense under\r\naggravating circumstances (up to five days).  The only other kind\r\nof confinement is restriction to one's room, which can be imposed\r\nfor ordinary and aggravated high offenses for seven and ten days,\r\nand for an aggravated moderate offense for five days.\r\n Given the legitimacy of a disciplinary system in a treatment\r\nprogram under the auspices of a department of correction, such \r\nutilization of sequestration fulfills the requirement of being\r\nsuitably tailored to the change of circumstances.  We find that\r\nmodification of the Supplemental Decree is therefore justified.\r\n                         *  *  *\r\n We note only briefly an issue that our decision has mooted    \r\nwhether or not the district court erred in vacating several orders\r\nof Judge Young.  These orders all dealt with participation of\r\npsychologists or psychiatrists in various kinds of decision and\r\npolicy making in the use of sequestration.  Our holding that the\r\nproposed modifications in the Supplemental Decree as illustrated by\r\nthe Plan are both based on significant changes in fact and are\r\ntailored to those changes leaves no room for the continued survival\r\nof Judge Young's orders, which served as interim measures pending\r\na long-term resolution.\r\n We have considered the other arguments advanced by appellants,\r\nintervenor plaintiffs, and amicus and deem them either to raise\r\nissues not presented to the district court or otherwise without\r\nmerit.\r\n At this point we can only say that court and counsel have done\r\ntheir jobs well in what must be one of the most complex and vexing\r\nareas of law and administration.  What we have said in upholding\r\nmodifications of the Decrees concerning DOC's Plan should not be\r\nconstrued as rulings foreclosing issues arising out of Plan\r\nadministration in the future.  What we have done is to survey the\r\nnew regime, its general approach, and to give a green light.  That\r\ndoes not mean that reckless driving will be immune from review.  We\r\nrely on the district court, which has commendably shown its\r\nreadiness to exercise its oversight powers.\r\n Affirmed. \n",

A reference to prior cases is contained in the opinion\r\njust cited.  Our present review concerns the proposed\r\nmodifications, granted by the district court, of two longstanding\r\nconsent decrees, the Original Decree and the Supplemental Decree. \r\nThe Original Decree had provided that the Center would be\r\ntreated as a facility of the Department of Mental Health (DMH),\r\nwith primary authority to be exercised by DMH and custodial \r\npersonnel to be controlled by the Department of Correction (DOC). \r\nPatients were to have \"the least restrictive conditions necessary\r\nto achieve the purpose of commitment.\"  Both DMH and DOC were to\r\n\"take steps jointly\" to improve physical conditions, carry out a\r\nmeaningful work program, and have \"a system of differing security\r\nfor different categories of patients\" to permit less restrictive\r\nconditions for those patients not requiring maximum security.  \r\nIn an earlier opinion we considered challenges to proposed\r\nmodifications of that decree.  See King v. Greenblatt (\"King I\"),\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196006\"><a href=\"/opinion/196006/king-v-greenblatt/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1995).  We addressed the significance of the\r\nrecently enacted 1993 Mass Acts. ch. 489, which gave DOC exclusive\r\njurisdiction of the care, treatment, rehabilitation and   an added\r\nstatutory goal   custody of civilly committed sexually dangerous\r\npersons in the Center.  We held that this statute met the first\r\nprong of Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112679\"><a href=\"/opinion/112679/rufo-v-inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384\r\n(1992) (i.e., it was a significant change of law impacting an\r\nexisting consent decree, warranting modification of such decree),\r\nbut remanded the case to the district court to consider whether the\r\nproposed modifications met the second Rufo prong, id. (i.e.,\r\nwhether the modifications were \"suitably tailored\" to the new law). \r\nSee King I, 52 F.3d at 7.\r\nUpon remand, the district court found that the proposed\r\nmodifications to the Original Degree were \"suitably tailored\" to the\r\nnew law; the court also determined that the proposed modifications\r\nto the Supplemental Decree met both prongs of Rufo as they were\r\n\"sufficiently related\" to the change in state law and \"suitably\r\ntailored.\"  The case was then appealed to us.  We remanded it to\r\nthe district court to address only issues relevant to the\r\nSupplemental Decree, and reserved our \"suitable tailoring\" review\r\nand all other issues relating to the Original Decree.\r\nWe recognized that the proposed modifications in the\r\nSupplemental Decree went beyond a transfer of exclusive authority\r\nto DOC and would effect substantive changes in disciplinary\r\npolicies, allowing the imposition of sequestration for punishment\r\npurposes (except for acts underlying commitment) and deleting a ban\r\non all discipline and punitive procedures in the treatment of\r\ninmates civilly committed.  See King II, 127 F.3d at 195.  We\r\nopined that the link between a change in administration and\r\nsequestration policy was too tenuous, at least without further\r\ndevelopment.  Id.  We also held that neither Chapter 489, \"at least\r\nwithout further explanation,\" nor our speculation, standing alone,\r\nthat the Massachusetts legislature had apparently accepted a\r\npreference for behavior modification over mental health treatment\r\nwould constitute a \"significant change in law\" affecting\r\nsequestration policy.  Id.\r\nWe therefore sent back the proposed modifications of the  \r\nSupplemental Decree to the district court for further\r\nconsideration, leaving it to the court to decide whether additional \r\nfactual or opinion evidence was needed.  The court has since\r\ncomplied with our directive and, after hearing and submissions, has\r\ndetermined both that the change in control managed by Chapter 489\r\nis a significant change in the law affecting the Supplemental\r\nDecree and that the modifications were suitably tailored.  We now\r\naddress this determination and all outstanding issues relating to\r\nboth decrees.\r\nThis litigation, now in its twenty-seventh year, involving\r\nhalf a dozen district judges, magistrate judges, and many\r\nconferences, hearings briefings, and appeals, has accomplished much\r\nin a troubled and complex field of custody and treatment of\r\ninstitutionalized sexually dangerous persons.  During this period,\r\nchanges have occurred in conditions of confinement and treatment,\r\nin the problems confronted, and in the institutional setting. \r\nAfter exhaustive briefings and argument from capable counsel, we\r\nconclude that the district court acted sensitively and\r\nappropriately in conducting the proceedings below, upholding the\r\nproposed modifications of both the Original Decree and the\r\nSupplemental Decree, and signaling its readiness to exercise its\r\noversight when occasion warrants.  While we cannot expect \"closure\"\r\nof tensions and problems, we may hope for problems of smaller\r\ndimension capable of systematic resolution without the necessity of\r\nheroic effort.\r\nWe first address several issues relating to the Original\r\nDecree.\r\n                I.     The Original Decree.\r\nA.  Denial of Discovery and Evidentiary Hearing.\r\nPlaintiffs repeatedly requested the opportunity to engage in\r\ndiscovery and an evidentiary hearing.  They sought to discern\r\nwhether DOC intended to provide \"meaningful treatment under the\r\nPlan\" and whether its treatment plan was consistent with the \"least\r\nrestrictive conditions\" requirement of the Original Decree. \r\nPlaintiffs proposed accomplishing this by exploring DOC's past\r\nbehavior, present behavior, and expressions of future intent. \r\nPlaintiffs' proposal contemplates interviews with all residents,\r\nexamination of new procedures, expert testimony interpreting the\r\nPlan, investigation of current practices, inquiry into internal\r\nmemos relating to the Plan and the persons instrumental in\r\nformulating it, and depositions of DOC officials and Joint Resource\r\nInstitute (JRI) personnel responsible for treatment.  As much as\r\nsix months of time would be needed.\r\nThe basic response of the court in denying discovery requests\r\nwas:\r\nIt may be that the plan won't work, but the Court of\r\nAppeals . . . [told me not to] prejudge the plan, but\r\nthey told me . . . I should have a hearing, inquire into\r\nthe DOC plan, giving significant weight to the local\r\ngovernment.\r\n                     *     *     *\r\n. . . [W]hat would DOC do under this plan?  And then I\r\nshould use my judicial oversight, primarily rely on my\r\njudicial oversight, to insure that the DOC is complying\r\nwith the decrees.  So it seems to me that that's a very\r\nclear blueprint.\r\n\nThis was an accurate precis of our directives \"to give\r\nsignificant weight to the views of local government officials\" and\r\nto \"rely primarily on its jurisdictional oversight to ensure DOC's\r\ncompliance with the decrees.\"  King I, 52 F.3d at 7.  Moreover,\r\neven absent these directives, a trial court is vested with broad\r\ndiscretion in granting or denying discovery.  8 Charles A. Wright\r\net al., Federal Practice and Procedure   2006, at 91 (1994). \r\nThe task of the district court, following our directives, was\r\nto determine whether DOC, which had been given authority under\r\nstate law, was likely to manage the Center without doing violence\r\nto the substantive portions of the Original Decree.  In the words\r\nof the Special Master appointed by the court, the inquiry being\r\nundertaken was \"whether DOC is approaching the control of the\r\ninstitution with a treatment modality.\"\r\nIn support of its proposal for extensive discovery and\r\nhearing, plaintiffs relied principally on the extensive procedure\r\nwhich the trial judge adopted on remand in Inmates of the Suffolk\r\nCounty Jail v. Rufo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1523246\"><a href=\"/opinion/1523246/inmates-of-suffolk-county-jail-v-rufo/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Mass. 1994).  But it does\r\nnot follow from the fact that a judge allowed discovery and\r\nevidentiary hearing in one case that a denial of discovery in a\r\ndifferent case is an abuse of discretion.\r\nAppellants' basic interest in discovery was to elicit views\r\nand evidence of DOC's sincerity.  To test the viability of this\r\ngoal in the particular posture in which the district court found\r\nitself, we venture the following scenario.  Assume that a number of\r\nwitnesses testified in deposition or at a hearing that DOC\r\nofficials were insincere and had no intention of carrying out the\r\nPlan as written.  If the court found the witnesses credible, would\r\nit then deny DOC's request to modify?  The consequence would be\r\nthat the Center would then revert to the earlier dual management,\r\ndespite the passage of Chapter 489.  Or, would the court craft, as\r\namicus argued, its own solution, substituting the Clinical Director\r\nfor DOC, creating the bizarre situation of an employee of an entity\r\nunder contract with DOC holding powers denied to DOC?  In either\r\ncase DOC would have no future opportunity to demonstrate its\r\nfitness to manage.\r\nIt seems clear to us that had the court pursued either course,\r\nit would not have accorded \"significant weight to the views of\r\nlocal government officials.\"  Indeed, it would have rejected them\r\nin their entirety on the ground of insincerity.  This would violate\r\nnot only our guidance but that of the Supreme Court in Rufo, 502\r\nU.S. at 392 n.14.  It would also violate our directive to rely\r\nprimarily on continuing oversight.\r\nWe think it therefore reasonable, at the proposed\r\nmodifications stage, that the district court declined to allow an\r\nextensive investigation as to whether DOC was acting in good faith. \r\nWe are not saying that the court would have abused its discretion\r\nhad it chosen to allow some kind of discovery and evidentiary\r\nhearing, but certainly it did not abuse its broad discretion in\r\ndenying such.\r\nB.  Delayed Appointment of Counsel.\r\nAmong the interests represented in the cluster of lawsuits now\r\ncollected under the King v. Greenblatt tent are those raised in\r\nWilliams v. Lesiak, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490910\"><a href=\"/opinion/490910/harold-williams-v-william-lesiak/\"><span class=\"volume\">822</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1223</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1987).  In that case,\r\nthe plaintiffs had focused on treatment issues at the Center,\r\nparticularly the absence or inferior quality of work, job training,\r\nand educational programs.  On May 27, 1994, the district court\r\nreopened Williams and consolidated it with King.  Although the\r\nremaining Williams plaintiffs requested counsel on a number of\r\noccasions, counsel was not appointed for them until August 17,\r\n1995.  This delay, they contend, constituted an abuse of discretion\r\nand is reason for reversal.\r\nHere again the review threshold is high.  This being a civil\r\ncase, there is no constitutional right to counsel and the statutory\r\nauthority, 28 U.S.C.  1915, is discretionary.  See Cookish v.\r\nCunningham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"467534\"><a href=\"/opinion/467534/dennis-r-cookish-v-michael-cunningham-warden-new-hampshire-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">787</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2 (1st Cir. 1986).  Moreover, we may find\r\nreversible error only if \"exceptional circumstances were present\r\nsuch that a denial of counsel was likely to result in fundamental\r\nunfairness impinging on [plaintiffs'] due process rights.\" \r\nDesRosiers v. Moran, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572165\"><a href=\"/opinion/572165/steven-m-desrosiers-v-john-j-moran/\"><span class=\"volume\">949</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nOur review of the evaluation of this complex and multi-faceted\r\nlitigation during the fifteen months of delay reveals court actions\r\nwhich manifested a sensitivity to the interests of Williamsplaintiffs and a total absence of recognizable unfairness.  The\r\nfirst stage during this period began on May 27, 1994, with the\r\nreopening of Williams and the court's denial of the Commonwealth's\r\nmotion to modify the Original Decree.  At this time the court,\r\nhaving recently appointed counsel for a different group of patients\r\nintervening in King, the \"Class of 48 + 1,\" expressed the hope that\r\nsuch counsel would \"look at the global picture.\"  The court also\r\nindicated that it might look for another person who would represent\r\nonly the Williams plaintiffs.  In December 1994, appointed counsel\r\nfor the \"Class of 48 + 1\" plaintiffs informed a Williams party that\r\nhe was not representing his interests.  From this time, therefore,\r\nuntil August 17, 1995, the Williams plaintiffs knew they were\r\nunrepresented.\r\nAny lack of representation during this period, however, was\r\nwithout any practical effect.  As the district court denied the\r\nCommonwealth's motion to modify at the hearing on May 27, 1994, the\r\nWilliams plaintiffs suffered no disadvantage at that time.  We did\r\nnot issue an opinion on the Commonwealth's appeal of that denial\r\nuntil April 6, 1995.  The appeal concentrated on the significance\r\nof the enactment of Chapter 489, and did not raise any Williamsissue.  Our opinion, after holding that the statute had indeed\r\nconstituted a significant change of law, meeting Rufo's first\r\nprong, simply remanded the case to the district court to consider\r\nwhether the second Rufo prong had been met.  Again, there was no\r\nopportunity for harm to the Williams plaintiffs' interests in the\r\nappeal.  In the interim period between the denial of the motion to\r\nmodify and our decision on the appeal, DOC submitted its Management\r\nPlan for the Administration of the Treatment Center (Plan), views\r\nwere exchanged between a Special Master and DOC, and settlement\r\ndiscussions took place.  These discussions generally resulted in an\r\nimpasse.  Moreover, during much of this time, the interests of all\r\nresidents were identical, since the original motion to modify\r\nsought only a change in administrative control.  \r\nIn May 1995, the court denied discovery, see supra, resolving\r\nto confine its efforts to a close scrutiny of the Plan itself. \r\nThus, neither side was allowed to investigate or receive additional\r\ndocumentation on or deposition of the other.  And although on\r\nNovember 11, 1994, the Commonwealth filed a renewed motion to\r\nmodify, seeking a change in the Supplemental Decree, no action was\r\ntaken by the district court until June 29, 1995.  At that time, the\r\ndistrict court granted the renewed motion, but it also stayed four\r\nimportant parts of the Plan, including the Community Access Plan\r\n(CAP), involving issues prominent in Williams.  Six weeks later, on\r\nAugust 17, 1995   before any action was taken on the stayed\r\nprovisions of the Plan, or on any other area concerning which the\r\nWilliams plaintiffs had expressed concern   counsel was appointed. \r\nOn this record, not only have counsel been unable to point to\r\nany prejudice stemming from the delay in appointing counsel for the \r\nWilliams plaintiffs, but we see no possibility, as the case\r\nprogressed through its various stages, of any prejudice or \r\n\"fundamental unfairness.\"  We are satisfied that their interests\r\nwere adequately protected by the appointment of counsel in August\r\n1995.\r\nC.  \"Suitable Tailoring\" of Modifications.\r\nThe second prong of Rufo requires that a consent decree be\r\nchanged no more than necessary to resolve the problems created by\r\nthe change of circumstances.  The proposed modifications must not\r\ndefeat the core purpose of the consent decree nor, of course,\r\ncreate a constitutional violation.  See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391-92.\r\nSuperficially, one might say that the changed circumstance is\r\nsimply the vesting of all authority over the Center in DOC and that\r\nthe proposed modifications for the Original Decree merely parrot\r\nChapter 489 by substituting DOC for joint mention of DOC and DMH. \r\nSuch a literal approach, however, obscures the reality that the\r\nMassachusetts legislature, in vesting unitary control in DOC, was\r\nalso recognizing that DOC's views of the policies best suited to\r\nbalance the two objectives of the Center   effective treatment of\r\nthe sexually dangerous persons and the security and safety of the\r\npatient/inmate and the population as a whole   differed from those\r\nwhich had guided DMH during much of the previous quarter of a\r\ncentury.  Legislative emphasis on the goal of security and safety\r\nis evidenced by the addition of \"custody\" in the Chapter 489\r\namendment to the previous formulation of goals in Mass. Gen. Laws.\r\nch. 123A  2 of \"care, treatment and rehabilitation.\"  Accordingly,\r\nthe change in control contemplated change in operations and\r\nembraced the grant of some degree of flexibility and initiative to\r\nDOC.\r\nSimilarly, the proposed modifications cannot be limited to the\r\nsimple change in authority, since, as we have just noted, that\r\nchange is inevitably overlaid with some expectation of change in\r\nsome policies and practices.  This does not mean that DOC has carte\r\nblanche to do anything it wishes, for the Original Decree remains\r\nunmodified in its requirement that \"patients at the Treatment\r\nCenter should have the least restrictive conditions necessary to\r\nachieve the purposes of commitment.\"  \r\nThis provision is the substantive essence of the Original\r\nDecree.  The decree does not embrace all the policies and practices\r\nthat have been relied on in the past by DMH to achieve effective\r\ntreatment under the least restrictive conditions.  By the same\r\ntoken, as the district court realized, the \"proposed modifications\"\r\nare not the host of provisions in the 138-page Plan, which simply\r\nsets forth ways in which DOC aspires to fulfill the requirements of\r\nthe Original Decree.\r\nThe task of conducting a \"suitable tailoring\" analysis\r\ntherefore requires trying to determine if the basic thrust of the\r\nnew authority is likely to violate \"least restrictive conditions\"\r\nor constitutional requirements.  While the Commonwealth has the\r\nburden to demonstrate \"suitable tailoring,\" we have also instructed\r\nthe district court, as we have noted, to give significant weight to\r\nthe views of local officials and to rely \"primarily\" on continuing\r\njudicial oversight to rectify violations.  King I, 52 F.3d at 7. \r\nAccordingly, unless a demonstrably inadequate or erroneous policy\r\nundercutting the Original Decree appears from an anticipatory\r\nscrutiny of the Plan, DOC should be allowed to proceed.\r\nThe district court had before it not only the Plan but two\r\nvolumes of appendices, exhibits, and affidavits, comments from the\r\nplaintiffs and the Special Master, and responses by DOC.  The Plan\r\nhas seven sections:  (1) management and staffing; (2) clinical\r\ntreatment program; (3) educational and vocational treatment; (4)\r\nbehavior management; (5) resident management and operations; (6)\r\nCAP; and (7) integration of the Center with the prison program for\r\nsex offenders.  The district court reviewed in some detail behavior\r\nmanagement provisions (specifically, the Behavior Review Committee,\r\nthe Minimum Privilege Unit, and Transfer Board policies), CAP, and\r\nresident management and operations (specifically, the restriction\r\nof privileges).\r\nThe court found that the Plan was \"a permissible and detailed\r\nproposal\" addressing both the increased emphasis on security and\r\ntreatment concerns.  With respect to security, the court stated,\r\n\"security concerns in the Treatment Center have always been viewed\r\nas legitimate.\"  As to treatment, the court took note of the fact\r\nthat treatment was to be provided by JRI, which had been under\r\ncontract with DMH since 1992, and that its employee, Dr. Barbara\r\nSchwartz, the Center's Treatment Director, affirmed that DOC would\r\nretain the clinical, educational, vocational and rehabilitation\r\nprograms initiated by JRI.  It therefore approved the proposed\r\nmodifications, concluding that the Plan \"appears to properly\r\nbalance the competing goals of treatment and security and\r\nadequately protects the rights of the residents.\"     \r\nThe court refused, however, to vacate the Decrees, as the\r\nCommonwealth requested, stating:\r\nWhile the Plan details the provision of treatment and the\r\nability of DOC to address security concerns, at bottom,\r\nthe potential for conflict between these interests\r\ncontinues to exist.  The confusing and conflicting roles\r\nof DMH and DOC have been resolved.  It is DOC's sole\r\nresponsibility to provide treatment in a secure setting. \r\nThe Plan provides them with the rules to accomplish this. \r\nThe Plan does not, and no plan can, provide the\r\nwillingness and commitment in doing so.\r\n\nThus recognizing that only future performance would administer the\r\nPlan in harmony with the essence of the Decrees, the court denied\r\nthe motion to vacate without prejudice to review it for one year;\r\nfollowing that period, during which the court would monitor Plan\r\nimplementation, it would reconsider the motion.\r\nOn appeal, appellants first level the general charge that DOC\r\n\"has essentially turned the Treatment Center into a prison and\r\nfundamentally altered the therapeutic community.\"  It is, of\r\ncourse, true that the added emphasis on security and safety,\r\ntogether with a new approach to behavior management, featuring\r\ndefinite sanctions for defined unacceptable behavior, will\r\ninevitably effect some retreat from a more permissive atmosphere. \r\nBut appellants' sweeping condemnation cannot stand without more\r\nprecise identification of serious defects in the many provisions\r\nregarding varieties of treatment, the extent of clinical\r\nsupervision, and the safeguards of individual rights.\r\nAppellants turn specifically to four areas.  The first is CAP,\r\nwhere the participants have shrunk from fifty-six in 1988 to two in\r\n1997.  They also criticize the application process that must be\r\ncompleted by an patient/inmate before being accepted for release\r\ninto the community.  Under the Plan, the patient/inmate must\r\ninitiate his own program proposal, then must face review with the\r\nprospect that, if once denied acceptance, he must begin again after\r\na six month delay.  Appellants also say that the Community Access\r\nBoard should, under Youngberg v. Romeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110746\"><a href=\"/opinion/110746/youngberg-v-romeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">307</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982), be\r\nentirely composed of clinicians.\r\nThe Plan devotes some forty-four pages to CAP.  This has\r\nobviously been a subject of intense rethinking.  Under a change in\r\nthe statute, a resident is no longer eligible for participation if\r\nhe is still serving a sentence; he must now have completed serving\r\nany criminal sentence.  The introductory section observes that the\r\nprior policies did not adequately emphasize public safety and\r\nstates, \"Recent events and improvements in the understanding of\r\nboth the dynamics of sexual offenses and the realistic objectives\r\nfor treatment, as well as legislative change to Chapter 123A, have\r\nlead [sic] to the development of a revised program.\"  The Plan\r\nadopts a cautious approach which recognizes that \"sexually\r\ndangerous persons\" will \"never cease to be 'at risk.'\"\r\nAccordingly, whereas access to the community had earlier been\r\napproved prior to the designing of a program, careful, even\r\nmeticulous, planning must now precede approval of access.  The\r\nprocess of plan review and approval is indeed a daunting,\r\nattenuated one.  But we cannot at this juncture rule the new\r\nprogram out of bounds.  In this most sensitive area of tension\r\nbetween safety and treatment, and between the individual and the\r\ncommunity, we cannot say that CAP is not the least restrictive\r\nfeasible response.\r\nThe shrinkage in numbers of participants must be viewed\r\nagainst the background that a substantial number of residents, many\r\nof whom are serving very lengthy sentences, simply refuse to\r\nparticipate in or apply to treatment programs.  Moreover, a JRI\r\nanalysis reveals that in 1996, three of the ninety-one eligible\r\nresidents of a total population of 202 submitted applications and\r\nproposed plans.  As of January 1997, two remained in the program\r\nwhile twelve resided in the less restrictive Community Transition\r\nHouse in a \"pre-transition\" program.  This does not, in our opinion,\r\npoint to any obvious constitutional failure.  Further adjudication\r\nwill have to await events.\r\nAs for the Youngberg argument that the entire Community Access\r\nBoard should consist of clinicians, we refer to our discussion,\r\ninfra, in relation to a similar criticism of decision making in the\r\nbehavior management area.  \r\nAnother area of specific criticism is the Transfer Board and\r\nits policies.  The Transfer Board is a creation of Chapter 489,\r\nenacting a new section 2A of Chapter 123, which provides that a\r\nresident who is serving under an unexpired criminal sentence may be\r\ntransferred from the Center to a correctional institution.  The\r\nfactors that may be considered are \"unamenability to treatment,\"\r\n\"unwillingness to follow treatment recommendations, lack of\r\nprogress in treatment, danger to other residents or staff, [and]\r\nsecurity.\"  Appellants say the policies fail to identify treatment\r\nand the criteria for \"unamenability of treatment.\"  They also\r\ncontend that the Board is insufficiently clinical in composition,\r\nand that there are no criteria defining when a patient may be\r\neligible for return to the Center.  \r\nWe preface our consideration of appellants' contentions by\r\nrecalling the basic rationale that prompted the new statutory\r\nprovisions.  As Dr. Schwartz explained in her affidavit, the\r\nearlier transfer provisions allowed transfer only for threat of\r\nharm or escape.  She observed that some residents refuse treatment;\r\nthey \"cannot profit from treatment simply because of the length of\r\ntheir underlying sentences.\"  Instead of these residents occupying\r\nlimited places at the Center, it makes \"far more sense\" to allow\r\n\"new and motivated admissions.\"\r\nWe find adequate assurances of treatment.  In the first place,\r\nthe Plan indicates that in placing a resident, the classification\r\nprocess will attempt to identify an institution where sex offender\r\ntreatment is available.  Additionally, the statute itself states\r\nthat DOC \"shall make available a program of voluntary treatment\r\nservices.\"  Finally, a member of the Center's treatment team will\r\nbe liaison to prison staff.  As for vagueness of \"amenability\" and\r\n\"security,\" regulations have fleshed out the terms, the former being\r\ndefined as failure to participate or make progress in six months\r\nand the latter as consisting of danger of physical harm to others\r\nmanifested through threats or assaults.\r\nWith respect to appellants' claim that the criteria for return\r\nto the Center are undefined, we think that the Plan properly\r\naddresses the need for criteria.  It specifically contemplates the\r\nestablishment of guidelines, stating, \"the Transfer Board will\r\nsuggest minimum criteria for consideration of the resident's future\r\nreturn to the Treatment Center.\"  The provision charges those\r\npersons responsible for transferring inmates to the Center   and\r\ntherefore those persons most knowledgeable about the risks and\r\nresponsibilities accompanying the return of inmates   with\r\ndetermining how best to accommodate the needs of the inmates, the\r\nCenter and DOC.  \r\nWe have also reviewed appellants' arguments that the transfer\r\npolicies violated due process, double jeopardy and the ex post\r\nfacto clause.  The first claim is based on the assumption, which we\r\nhave stated is unfounded, that suitable treatment will not be\r\navailable to any transferred resident.  The last claims rest on the\r\nassumption that a transferred resident will suffer a belated\r\nincrease in his sentence.  We find it unnecessary to elaborate on\r\nthe district court's opinion resolving these issues as we are\r\nsatisfied with the judge's analysis and conclusion that, on the\r\nrecord before him, there was no evidence of such increase.  \r\nWith respect to clinical participation, the district court\r\nnoted in its opinion that\r\nThe Commonwealth has agreed to modify the composition of\r\nthe Board so that the Clinical Director of Treatment, the\r\nDeputy Superintendent of Programs and the Director of\r\nSecurity will be equally represented . . . . In other\r\nwords, the decision will be made by a vote of the\r\nprofessionals charged with the operation of the Treatment\r\nCenter.\r\n\nAppellants continue to assert that the only \"professionals\" who\r\ncould fulfill the requirement of Youngberg are mental health\r\nprofessionals.  We discuss this issue in the following paragraphs\r\ninvolving behavior management.  Our conclusion is equally\r\napplicable to the Community Access Board and the Transfer Board.  \r\nAn appropriate place to start our analysis of the behavior\r\nmanagement component of the Plan is to examine appellants'\r\ncriticism of the manner of imposing sanctions.  We note that this\r\ncriticism is levied at the Original Decree and is to be\r\ndistinguished from the substance, punishment and sequestration,\r\nwhich are proscribed by the Supplemental Decree.  \r\nThe controlling document, 103 MTC 430A, \"Observation of\r\nBehavior Reports,\" sets forth the Center's disciplinary system,\r\nincluding a \"clear set of rules\" and a \"clear set of sanctions.\"  The\r\nmonitoring and enforcing body is the Behavior Review Committee. \r\nAppointed by the Superintendent, it consists of one security staff\r\nmember, one clinician and one JRI staff member.  This committee\r\ndeals with violations meriting such sanctions as warnings, and\r\nroom, unit, work, and visitation restrictions.  In addition, the\r\nSuperintendent has the authority to impose sequestration awaiting\r\nhearing, investigation, prosecution or a transfer hearing in\r\ninstances where the resident has threatened, attempted, or\r\ninflicted serious harm on others.  \r\nAppellants contend that such decisions violate the teaching of\r\nYoungberg that only qualified professionals should make treatment\r\ndecisions regarding involuntarily committed individuals.  We begin\r\nby noting, as we did in Cameron v. Tomes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603796\"><a href=\"/opinion/603796/robert-e-cameron-v-henry-tomes/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993), that\r\nYoungberg was a \"cautiously phrased decision,\" directed to the right\r\nof a mentally retarded inmate to \"minimally adequate . . . training\r\nto ensure safety and freedom from undue restraint.\"  Id. at 18\r\n(citing Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 319).  Moreover, the Court in\r\nYoungberg gave a rather flexible, context-related definition of\r\nwhat it meant by \"professional\":  \"a person competent, whether by\r\neducation, training or experience, to make the particular decision\r\nat issue.\"  457 U.S. at 323 n.30.  It added the circumscribed\r\ncaveat that \"[l]ong-term treatment decisions normally should be\r\nmade by persons with degrees in medicine or nursing, or with\r\nappropriate training in such areas as psychology . . . .\"  Id. \r\nUnlike in Youngberg, what is at issue here is not long term\r\ntreatment decisions but short term disciplinary decisions.  We look\r\nin our analysis to the guidance we deliberately gave, in Cameron,\r\nfor the future application of the concept of professionals and to\r\nthe role of administrators:\r\nAny professional judgment that decides an issue involving\r\nconditions of confinement must embrace security and\r\nadministration, and not merely medical judgments. . . .\r\nThe administrators are responsible to the state and to\r\nthe public for making professional judgments of their\r\nown, encompassing institutional concerns as well as\r\nindividual welfare.\r\n\n990 F.2d at 20.\r\nIn this case, the disciplinary system is responsive to both\r\nthe \"treatment\" need of residents to learn accountability for their\r\nactions and the administrative and security concerns of the\r\ninstitution.  The composition of the Behavior Review Committee,\r\nwith one DMH professional, and one security-minded member from DOC,\r\nand one JRI person with overall treatment program responsibility\r\nseems well suited to the mix of concerns involved in sequestration\r\ndecisions.  Indeed, if mental health professionals were to control\r\nall decisions, certainty and regularity of sanction imposition\r\nwould necessarily be swallowed up by ad hoc individualized decision\r\nmaking.  We know of no case authority that would declare the\r\ndecision process in applying sanctions described in the Plan\r\nfacially constitutionally defective.  We decline the invitation to\r\nextend Youngberg anticipatorily to this case.\r\nThe authority to sequester \"awaiting action\" wielded by the\r\nSuperintendent implicates procedural concerns.  The district court\r\nwas sensitive to these concerns and required DOC to give the due\r\nprocess protections of written notice of reasons for placement and\r\nopportunity to respond required by Hewitt v. Helms, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110829\"><a href=\"/opinion/110829/hewitt-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n471 (1983), in cases of administrative segregation.  The court, in\r\nso doing, acknowledged that its action stemmed from its recognition\r\nthat residents, unlike the prison inmate in Assandin v. Corner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2293</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995), were entitled to due process protections. \r\nAgain, on this record we are not prepared to declare any breach of\r\nprocedural due process.\r\nA final target of the criticism is in the area of resident\r\nmanagement and operations.  Appellants protest a number of\r\nprivileges which have been truncated.  These involve the amount of\r\nclothing allowed to be kept by a patient, the amount of funds, and\r\nthe number of room visits, telephone calls, stamps, credit cards,\r\netc.  The Plan justifies some reduction in these privileges because\r\nof past experiences with security, assault, gambling, coercion, and\r\ninterruptions in treatment.  No reduction rises to the level of a\r\nconstitutional infraction.\r\nWhen all the smoke has cleared, the legislatively ordered\r\nchange in command and the directions which it proposes to take do\r\nnot exceed the reasonable latitude implicit in the legislative\r\nchange of command.  Nor does either appear likely to undermine the\r\nOriginal Decree or to violate the Constitution.\r\n\n                II.  The Supplemental Decree.\r\nA.   Modification.\r\n While modification of the Original Decree involved mainly a\r\nchange from dual control to exclusive DOC management of the Center,\r\nthe Supplemental Decree and any modifications proposed were\r\nsubstantive.  The Supplemental Decree barred solitary confinement\r\nfor punishment, \"disciplinary and punitive procedures having no\r\nplace in the care and treatment of civilly committed patients.\" \r\nThe requested modifications would strike the general proscription\r\nof disciplinary and punishment procedures and link solitary\r\nconfinement to the offense underlying the original commitment of\r\nthe individual.\r\n In King II, we were not persuaded that the mere change in\r\ncontrol implicated this substantive change.  We therefore remanded\r\nthe question of justification for modification and left it to the\r\ndistrict court to decide whether further factual development or\r\nopinion evidence was needed.  The court decided that it did not\r\nrequire an evidentiary hearing and scheduled a prompt submission of\r\nbriefs and a hearing for presentation of views.  Appellants\r\nsubmitted several affidavits, and appellees rested on the record. \r\nThe court ruled that a significant change in fact had occurred,\r\nbased on examination of the Plan and monthly DOC reports which\r\nverified DOC's adherence to the Plan, a visit to the Center with\r\ncounsel, discussion with the residents at the Center, and review of \r\nopinions of the qualified professional in charge of the\r\nadministration of the Plan, Dr. Schwartz.  The court also stated\r\nthat the dramatically changed conditions of segregation that had\r\ntaken place since 1972 constituted a relevant added factual\r\ndevelopment.\r\n We agree with the district court but would add another factual\r\ndevelopment called for by our scrutiny of the record, namely, a\r\nsignificant change in the philosophical approach to treatment of\r\ncivilly committed sex offenders in programs operated by\r\ncorrectional departments.  We do not mean that there has been a\r\ncomplete reversal of position under all circumstances from the\r\nearlier, more permissive mental health approach to the more\r\nrestrictive behavior control approach.  But the monolithic\r\nacceptance of the mental health approach that existed a quarter of\r\na century ago has yielded to the acknowledgment that there is no\r\nroyal road to treatment and cure.  Behavioral control programs\r\nincluding defined offenses and sanctions are now featured in\r\ninstitutions operated by corrections personnel.\r\n We begin with the 1989 report of the Governor's Special\r\nAdvisory Panel on Forensic Mental Health, which preceded the\r\npassage in 1994 of Chapter 489.  We do not rely on opinions\r\nexpressed by that Panel, but on some factual statements which have\r\nnever been impugned.  Indicative of some kind of sea change is that\r\nmost of the thirty-one states that had \"special dispositional\r\nprovisions\" for sex offenders, i.e., indefinite commitments as in\r\nMassachusetts, repealed or significantly reformed the statutes. \r\nRepeal was recommended by the American Bar Association in its 1984\r\nproposed Criminal Justice Mental Health Standards on the ground\r\nthat, inter alia, the assumption that mental disability underlay\r\nsexual offenses in general was no longer viewed as clinically\r\nvalid.  A 1977 report of the American Psychiatry Association to the\r\nsame effect was cited. \r\n Dr. Roger Smith, the impressively credentialed Director of\r\nMichigan's Bureau of Forensic Mental Health, narrowed the focus to\r\nprograms run by correctional personnel.  In 1994, he evaluated the\r\nMassachusetts DOC Plan.  In an affidavit, he made the point that in\r\ninstitutions where civilly committed residents and corrections\r\ninmates are lodged and treated, \"[E]very attempt must be made to\r\napply program rules, and sanctions for violation of such rules, in\r\na uniform and fair manner, and to avoid the perception (or reality)\r\nthat civilly committed residents have privileges and rights which\r\nexceed those of their DOC peers.\"  In states that have opted to\r\ntreat sex offenders only in the months prior to parole release, he\r\nadded, programs generally are provided in minimum security\r\nsettings.  As for DOC's Plan, \"[t]he establishment of clear rules\r\nand sanctions for rule violations by residents is clearly long\r\noverdue, and essential to effective management of the therapeutic\r\nprogram.\"  He also found the restrictions on residents' privileges,\r\nsuch as visits and mail, to be \"consistent with standards found in\r\ncorrectional treatment programs nationwide.\"\r\n To this we add the unrebutted factual assertions of Dr.\r\nSchwartz, who is a JRI employee and the Clinical Director of the\r\nCenter.  Having trained staff from most of the prison-based sex\r\noffender treatment programs, she made the unqualified statement:\r\n\"Every sex offender program in the country which is operated by a\r\ncorrections department adheres to the disciplinary policy of the\r\ninstitution.\"\r\n These affidavits were filed with the court in November 1994. \r\nOnly after remand did appellants seek to counter such statements in\r\nany way.  In 1997, appellants filed affidavits of clinical\r\ndirectors of treatment programs in Kansas and Washington.  These \r\nprograms were run by a department of Social and Rehabilitation\r\nServices or of Social and Health Services and were available only\r\nto persons soon to finish serving their sentences or without\r\ncriminal sentences, whose release depended solely on their ability\r\nto control their conduct.  It is understandable that in Kansas\r\nsequestration for a period in excess of fifty-nine minutes was\r\nrare, and that in Washington there had been only one occasion in\r\nthirteen months to keep an inmate in a \"quiet room\" for up to four\r\nhours.  Clearly, the populations and the problems were quite\r\ndifferent from those in the Center.  Appellants also submitted a\r\ndraft of a proposed patients' handbook from Wisconsin, but although\r\nsome twenty-two definitions of \"major misconduct\" were set forth,\r\nthe Appendix we were furnished did not contain standards for either\r\nincapacitation measures or deterrent sanctions.  The program,\r\nunlike that we consider here, was confined to those who were only\r\ncivilly committed.  We view appellants' submissions concerning\r\nother states' civil-commitments-only programs as essentially\r\ncomparing oranges to appellees' apples.  \r\n Finally, appellants attempt to demonstrate that there has been\r\nno change in basic treatment philosophy by submitting a 1972 policy\r\nstatement by Dr. Harry Kozol, then Director of the Center, who did\r\nnot attribute his policy eschewing punishment to a mental illness\r\ntheory but rather to a view of self-discipline and personal\r\naccountability as focal patient goals.  Any similarity with the\r\npresent treatment philosophy stops at this point.  For Dr. Kozol\r\nwent on to describe the process of enforcing accountability: when\r\na patient was found to have engaged in \"antisocial and\r\ninappropriate behavior,\" a clinical study would be made of steps\r\nneeded to be taken, which could include, not segregation, but\r\n\"exclusion from the population and placement in the Special\r\nIntensive Treatment Unit.\"  This was, he stated, not looked upon as\r\n\"lock-up\" but, \"[i]n operation, this program has excluded patients\r\nfrom the general population for considerably longer periods than\r\npatients . . . were excluded in lock-up by the correctional\r\nauthority here.\"  We think it clear that this system   lacking\r\ndefinitions of \"antisocial and inappropriate behavior,\" and with\r\nsanctions that vary according to the clinical analysis,\r\nindeterminate sequestration, and release that depends on \"our\r\nclinical judgment that the risk of his acting offensively and\r\ninappropriately is reduced to a reasonable or substantial [sic]\r\nlevel\"   differs significantly from the Plan's approach. \r\n The factual assertions of the Special Advisory Panel and Dr.\r\nSchwartz, together with the observations of Michigan's Dr. Smith,\r\nlead us to accept as a significant change of fact the adoption of\r\na new treatment approach to sex offender treatment programs\r\nconducted by corrections departments.  Our survey of this record\r\nalso convinces us that the court did not err in not delaying its\r\nconsideration pending further discovery.  Appellants' request in\r\ntheir Joint Submission Concerning Supplemental Decree was couched\r\nin the alternative.  In the event that the court did not deny the\r\nmotion to modify the Supplemental Decree, they wished discovery,\r\nciting as their only objective, \"the deposition of defendants'\r\nwitnesses.\"  What we said in connection with the refusal to extend\r\ndiscovery relating to the Original Decree applies here.  We see\r\nlittle fruitful prospect in such proceedings; the court did not\r\nabuse its discretion in refusing such a request.\r\n The district court suitably relied on the Plan, its visit to\r\nthe Center, its talks with residents who did not complain about\r\ndiscipline, punishment, or conditions in the Minimum Privilege\r\nUnit, and on the opinion of Dr. Schwartz who averred, \"I consider\r\nthe institution of a disciplinary policy containing clearly defined\r\noffenses carrying definitive sanctions as an essential part of a\r\nstate-of-the-art treatment program.\" The court added that since\r\npunishment was clearly contemplated, \"it follows that appropriate\r\npunishment may include sequestration of some kind.\"  This last\r\nproposition may not be self evident.  We therefore elaborate.\r\n A reading of the Code of Offenses and list of sanctions\r\nsuggests to us the essentiality of sequestration to this Plan. \r\nThere are fifty-nine offenses divided among four categories.  There\r\nare eleven offenses described in the category of the greatest\r\nseverity, such as killing, rape, arson, and taking hostages.  In\r\nthe high category are seventeen offenses, including assault,\r\nbringing in illegal drugs, demanding protection money, and\r\ncounterfeiting.  The nineteen offenses in the moderate category\r\ninclude refusing a direct order, lying to a staff member, and\r\nthreatening another person.  The low category consists of twelve\r\noffenses, ranging from use of obscene language and unexcused\r\nabsences, to failure to follow safety regulations.\r\n In like manner, the sanctions vary both according to category\r\nand to whether the offense is accompanied by mitigating or\r\naggravating circumstances   or neither.  The most severe sanction\r\nis placement in the Minimum Privilege Unit for thirty days for a\r\nsevere offense accompanied by aggravating circumstances.  Other\r\nsanctions available for severe offenses include loss of privileges\r\nfrom sixty to eighty days, restitution, forfeiture of good time,\r\nrestitution, and loss of job.  The maximum sanction for a high\r\noffense, with  aggravating circumstances, is placement in the\r\nMinimum Privilege Unit for five days with a lesser alternative\r\nbeing room restriction for ten days, and, like a severe offense,\r\nrestitution, loss of privileges, good time, and job.  \r\n It is obvious that, if placement in the Minimum Privilege Unit\r\nwere not available as a sanction, the range of sanctions would be\r\nso telescoped and compressed that a resident could not expect much\r\nmore severe treatment for a high or severe offense than for a\r\nmoderate offense.  For example, a resident who had taken hostages\r\nmight lose some privileges for eighty days while a resident who\r\nrefused an order might lose some privileges for five days.  The\r\ndisparity between offenses far exceeds the disparity in sanctions\r\nthat could be imposed.  We therefore also conclude that\r\nsequestration is an integral part of the Plan's system of graduated\r\nand defined offenses and sanctions.\r\n Finally, we cannot fault the court for relying on the \"vastly\r\ndifferent\" conditions of confinement in the Minimum Privilege Unit\r\ntoday compared to those described in the King complaint.  King,\r\nplaced in solitary confinement without procedural safeguards for\r\ncalling a guard a \"dingbat,\" was placed in a six by nine foot cell,\r\nwithout a sink, only a portable chamber pot, no facilities for\r\ndrinking water, no reading or writing materials, no visits   not\r\neven from his parents   no radio or exercise . . . and filthy walls\r\nand floor.  \r\n The Minimum Privilege Unit, on the other hand, is a new\r\nbuilding constructed in 1986, with rooms eight by sixteen feet,\r\nwith toilet and sink.  Residents are allowed access to telephone,\r\nvisitors, exercise periods, daily showers, canteen, and library. \r\nThe regulations, 103 MTC423.07, provide that residents in the\r\nMinimum Privilege Unit will be accorded treatment by their regular\r\ntreatment team, unless some modification is dictated by safety and\r\nsecurity.  Additional or supplemental treatment \"will be provided\r\nas necessary.\"\r\n We are fully satisfied that this combination of a difference\r\nin basic approaches, a detailed Plan maintaining treatment\r\nstandards accompanied by a detailed disciplinary system, and\r\ndramatic changes in conditions of confinement amounts to the\r\nsignificant change in facts required by Rufo.\r\n As for the second prong, \"suitable tailoring,\" there is little\r\nneed for lengthy discussion.  The Plan preserves clinical treatment\r\nprograms and procedural safeguards.  Its departures from the\r\nSupplemental Decree, inaugurating a disciplinary system and\r\noutlining procedures for charging, deciding, and reviewing\r\ninfractions seem well within reasonable requirements.  The major\r\narea of difference, the Plan's provision for sequestration, reveals\r\na restrained resort to this sanction.  Placement in the Minimum\r\nPrivilege Unit is allowed under only four circumstances: commission\r\nof a severe offense with aggravating circumstances (up to thirty\r\ndays); a severe offense without either aggravating or mitigating\r\ncircumstances (up to twenty days); a severe offense under\r\nmitigating circumstances (up to ten days); and a high offense under\r\naggravating circumstances (up to five days).  The only other kind\r\nof confinement is restriction to one's room, which can be imposed\r\nfor ordinary and aggravated high offenses for seven and ten days,\r\nand for an aggravated moderate offense for five days.\r\n Given the legitimacy of a disciplinary system in a treatment\r\nprogram under the auspices of a department of correction, such \r\nutilization of sequestration fulfills the requirement of being\r\nsuitably tailored to the change of circumstances.  We find that\r\nmodification of the Supplemental Decree is therefore justified.\r\n                         *  *  *\r\n We note only briefly an issue that our decision has mooted    \r\nwhether or not the district court erred in vacating several orders\r\nof Judge Young.  These orders all dealt with participation of\r\npsychologists or psychiatrists in various kinds of decision and\r\npolicy making in the use of sequestration.  Our holding that the\r\nproposed modifications in the Supplemental Decree as illustrated by\r\nthe Plan are both based on significant changes in fact and are\r\ntailored to those changes leaves no room for the continued survival\r\nof Judge Young's orders, which served as interim measures pending\r\na long-term resolution.\r\n We have considered the other arguments advanced by appellants,\r\nintervenor plaintiffs, and amicus and deem them either to raise\r\nissues not presented to the district court or otherwise without\r\nmerit.\r\n At this point we can only say that court and counsel have done\r\ntheir jobs well in what must be one of the most complex and vexing\r\nareas of law and administration.  What we have said in upholding\r\nmodifications of the Decrees concerning DOC's Plan should not be\r\nconstrued as rulings foreclosing issues arising out of Plan\r\nadministration in the future.  What we have done is to survey the\r\nnew regime, its general approach, and to give a green light.  That\r\ndoes not mean that reckless driving will be immune from review.  We\r\nrely on the district court, which has commendably shown its\r\nreadiness to exercise its oversight powers.\r\n Affirmed. \n</pre>",
