The  passage  of  the  Prison\r                    SELYA,  Circuit Judge.\r                                         \r\n\nLitigation Reform Act, 18 U.S.C.A.    3626 (Supp. 1997) (the PLRA\r\n\nor  the  Act),  brought  cheers   to  the  lips  of  many  prison\r\n\nadministrators.  In  its wake, the Sheriff of  Suffolk County and\r\n\nthe Massachusetts  Commissioner of Correction  (collectively, the\r\n\ndefendants)  cast  their gaze  toward a  consent decree  that has\r\n\ngoverned important aspects  of the county's handling  of pretrial\r\n\ndetainees  since  1979.    Spying an  opportunity  to  sever  the\r\n\nshackles  of judicial oversight,  the defendants invoked  the new\r\n\nlaw  and  asked  the  supervising  tribunal,  the  United  States\r\n\nDistrict  Court for the District of  Massachusetts, to vacate the\r\n\ndecree  or,  in  the alternative,  to  terminate  all prospective\r\n\nrelief  under   it.     The  plaintiffs   questioned  the   Act's\r\n\nconstitutionality and  raised a host  of other objections  to the\r\n\ndefendants'   motions.      The  district   court   repulsed  the\r\n\nconstitutional  attack but construed the PLRA to require only the\r\n\ntermination of prospective relief, not the vacatur of the consent\r\n\ndecree itself.  See  Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Sheriff of\r                                                                           \r\n\nSuffolk County, 952 F. Supp. 869 (D. Mass. 1997) (D. Ct.

BACKGROUND\r          I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          This  litigation  deals  almost  exclusively  with  the\r\n\neffect  of  the PLRA  on  an extant  consent  decree.   Thus, the\r\n\nhistory  of the  conflict is  of  minimal import,  and we  merely\r\n\nsketch  it.    The shelves  of  any  reasonably  well-stocked law\r\n\nlibrary afford readers who hunger for  more exegetic detail ample\r\n\nopportunity to  dine elsewhere.   See, e.g.,  Inmates of  Suffolk\r                                                                           \r\n\nCounty Jail  v. Eisenstadt,  360 F. Supp.  676, 679-84  (D.

Kearney, 928 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n33, 34 (1st Cir. 1991); D. Ct. Op., 952 F. Supp. at 871-73.\r                                            \r\n\n          In  1971 the plaintiff class, which consists of present\r\n\nand future pretrial detainees held or  to be held in the  Suffolk\r\n\nCounty  jail  (collectively,  the plaintiffs),  brought  a  civil\r\n\naction  alleging that  the  conditions  of  their  confinement   \r\n\nparticularly  double bunking    violated the Eighth  Amendment to\r\n\nthe United States Constitution.  After extensive skirmishing, not\r\n\nrelevant here, the parties reached a rapprochement,  subsequently\r\n\napproved by the  district court and embodied in  the 1979 consent\r\n\ndecree, in  which they ratified  an architectural plan for  a new\r\n\nfacility  featuring   single-occupancy  cells.     The  agreement\r\n\ncontemplated  the phasing-out of the existing Charles Street jail\r\n\nonce the new structure was in place.\r\n\n          As the Scottish poet warned,  \"the best laid schemes o'\r\n\n                                4\r\r\n\nmice and men gang aft  a-gley,\" Robert Burns, To a  Mouse (1785),\r                                                                   \r\n\nand in  this case time proved  a formidable opponent.   Growth in\r\n\nprison  population  and  delays  in  construction  both  exceeded\r\n\nexpectations.  The new facility  (the Nashua Street jail) was not\r\n\ncompleted until mid-1990 and  was hard-pressed from the start  to\r\n\ncope with the  Sheriff's escalating needs.  In  response to these\r\n\nvolatile conditions,  the consent  decree was  modified by  court\r\n\norder in  1985,  1990, and  1994.    The last  of  these  changes\r\n\npermitted  limited double bunking  at the Nashua  Street facility\r\n\n(the  Sheriff having  closed the  Charles  Street facility  prior\r\n\nthereto).1\r\n\n          In   July  1996  the   Sheriff  initiated  the  current\r\n\nengagement.  He  grasped the weapon that Congress  had forged and\r\n\nmoved to terminate all  prospective relief pursuant to the  PLRA.\r\n\nNot to be  outdone, the Commissioner moved to  vacate the consent\r\n\ndecree outright, thus  formalizing a suggestion that  the Sheriff\r\n\nhad omitted  from his motion  but had included in  the memorandum\r\n\nsupporting the  motion.  When the plaintiffs  indicated that they\r\n\nwould  challenge the  Act's constitutionality  as  part of  their\r\n\nopposition, the federal government intervened.  After sorting out\r\n\nthe  components of  the parties' extensive  asseverational array,\r\n\nJudge  Keeton  gave  the  pertinent  provisions  of  the  PLRA  a\r\n\nnarrowing   construction  and   on   that   basis  upheld   their\r\n\nconstitutionality.   He thereupon granted the Sheriff's motion to\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1Notwithstanding the several emendations that have been made\r\nto  the original  consent  decree,  we refer  to  the decree,  as\r\nmodified from time to time, as the \"1979 consent decree.\"\r\n\n                                5\r\r\n\nthe extent that  the consent decree would \"no  longer be enforced\r\n\nby  an order  of  specific performance,\"  but declined  either to\r\n\nvacate  the  decree  or  to  \"terminate  the  obligations  stated\r\n\n[therein]\"  because  those  obligations  represented  \"consensual\r\n\nundertakings of the defendants with court approval.\"  Id. at 883.\r                                                                   \r\n\nAll parties appealed.\r\n\n          In an effort to cut a passable swath through this legal\r\n\nthicket, we start by construing  the termination provision of the\r\n\nPLRA.  We  then test its constitutionality and,  finding no merit\r\n\nin the plaintiffs'  constitutional challenges, apply the  Act and\r\n\nevaluate the  extent of the  remediation to which  the defendants\r\n\nare entitled.\r\n\nII.  THE PLRA\r          II.  THE PLRA\r\n\n          In parsing  the PLRA,  we afford de  novo review.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States  v. Gifford, 17  F.3d 462, 471-72 (1st  Cir. 1994).\r                                   \r\n\nSuch an exercise  in statutory interpretation always  begins with\r\n\nthe  language of the  statute itself.   See Stowell v.  Ives, 976\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.2d 65, 69 (1st Cir. 1992).  At this stage, an inquisitive court\r\n\nshould assume  that the  words of the  statute, if  not specially\r\n\ndefined, comport with their ordinary meaning, and that the words,\r\n\nso read, accurately  express the legislature's  intent.  See  FMC\r                                                                           \r\n\nCorp. v. Holliday, 498 U.S. 52, 57 (1990).  In keeping  with this\r                           \r\n\nprinciple,  the court should  \"resort to legislative  history and\r\n\nother aids of statutory construction only  when the literal words\r\n\nof  the  statute create  ambiguity  or  lead  to an  unreasonable\r\n\nresult.\"  United States v.  Charles George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n                                6\r\r\n\n685, 688 (1st  Cir. 1987) (citation and  internal quotation marks\r\n\nomitted).\r\n\n          The PLRA is  not a paragon  of clarity.   In regard  to\r\n\nexisting  federal court orders,  it declares  that \"in  any civil\r\n\naction   with  respect  to  prison  conditions,  a  defendant  or\r\n\nintervenor shall be entitled to the  immediate termination of any\r\n\nprospective relief if  the relief was approved or  granted in the\r\n\nabsence  of a finding  by the court  that the  relief is narrowly\r\n\ndrawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation\r\n\nof the Federal right, and  is the least intrusive means necessary\r\n\nto correct  the violation of  the Federal right.\"   18 U.S.C.A.  \r\n\n3626(b)(2).    Such  prospective  relief  shall   not  terminate,\r\n\nhowever, \"if the court makes written findings based on the record\r\n\nthat prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current or\r\n\nongoing violation of the  Federal right, extends no  further than\r\n\nnecessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that\r\n\nthe prospective relief is narrowly  drawn and the least intrusive\r\n\nmeans to correct the  violation.\"  Id.   3626(b)(3).  With regard\r                                                \r\n\nto   relief  not   yet  obtained,   the   Act  contains   similar\r\n\nproscriptions.   It  forbids courts  from  granting or  approving\r\n\nprospective relief \"unless  the court finds  that such relief  is\r\n\nnarrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary  to correct the\r\n\nviolation of the Federal right,  and is the least intrusive means\r\n\nnecessary to correct the violation of  the Federal right.\"  Id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n3626(a)(1)(A).\r\n\n          These iterations  are  clear  enough,  but  uncertainty\r\n\n                                7\r\r\n\narises when we examine the  Act's definitional instructions.  One\r\n\nsuch  passage defines \"prospective relief\" to include \"all relief\r\n\nother  than  compensatory  monetary damages,\"  and  then  defines\r\n\n\"relief\" to \"mean[] all relief in any form that may be granted or\r\n\napproved by the  court . . . includ[ing] consent decrees.\"  Id.  \r                                                                         \r\n\n3626(g)(7), (9).   \"Consent decree,\" in  turn, means \"any  relief\r\n\nentered by  the court that is based in whole  or in part upon the\r\n\nconsent  or acquiescence  of  the parties  but  does not  include\r\n\nprivate  settlements.\"   Id.     3626(b)(1).   In  a vacuum,  the\r                                      \r\n\ninteraction  of  the  Act's mechanics  and  these  definitions is\r\n\nmanageable:  terminating  \"prospective relief\"  as prescribed  by\r\n\nsection 3626(b)(2)  would  terminate \"all  relief,\"  see  section\r                                                                  \r\n\n3626(g)(7),  which  under  section 3626(g)(9)  \"includes  consent\r\n\ndecrees.\"    Read   literally,  therefore,  once   defendants  or\r\n\nintervenors  show  their  entitlement  to  terminate  prospective\r\n\nrelief, the  Act seemingly  requires termination  of the  consent\r\n\ndecree itself.\r\n\n          As the district court astutely observed, this result is\r\n\ncounterintuitive  in that it  contradicts the usual understanding\r\n\nof both \"relief\"  and \"consent decree.\"   See D. Ct. Op.,  952 F.\r                                                                  \r\n\nSupp.  at  878.   The  customary definition  of  \"consent decree\"\r\n\nlikens such decrees to judgments, see Black's  Law Dictionary 410\r                                                                       \r\n\n(6th  ed. 1990)  (defining  \"consent  decree\"  as  \"[a]  judgment\r\n\nentered by consent of the parties whereby the defendant agrees to\r\n\nstop  alleged  illegal   activity  without  admitting  guilt   or\r\n\nwrongdoing\"),  and in  ordinary usage  a judgment  is \"[a]  final\r\n\n                                8\r\r\n\ndecision of the  court resolving the dispute  and determining the\r\n\nrights and obligations of the parties,\" id. at 841-42.  \"Relief,\"\r                                                     \r\n\non the  other hand,  typically is equated  with \"remedy,\"  id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n1292,  which is \"the  means by which  a right is  enforced or the\r\n\nviolation  of a right  is prevented, redressed,  or compensated,\"\r\n\nid. at 1294.   Inasmuch as a remedy  effectuates the adjudication\r             \r\n\nexpressed  in  a  judgment,  one  ordinarily  would  assume  that\r\n\n\"relief,\" by extension, effectuates  the legal decision,  arrived\r\n\nat by consent, in a \"consent decree.\"\r\n\n          Congress  conflated the  two  terms  when it  described\r\n\nconsent decrees  as a form  of relief rather  than as  a judgment\r                                    \r\n\nthat  engenders relief.  The  PLRA's equation of \"consent decree\"\r                         \r\n\nand \"relief\" contradicts  conventional understandings and creates\r\n\na situation in which a strict, language-based construction of the\r\n\nPLRA requires that  commonplace legal  terms be  used in  curious\r\n\nways.   This circumstance fosters uncertainty, for a court cannot\r\n\nreally  tell, without  further  inquiry,  whether the  linguistic\r\n\nanomaly  is accidental or purposeful (and, thus, whether Congress\r\n\nmeant to uproot  consent decrees themselves or  merely to vitiate\r\n\nthe relief attendant to them,  when it directed federal courts to\r\n\nfacilitate  \"the immediate termination of any prospective relief\"\r\n\nat the behest  of prison litigation defendants  and intervenors).\r\n\nThis uncertainty impels us to consult extrinsic sources in search\r\n\nof guidance as to Congress's intent.\r\n\n          In  this  instance,   the  PLRA's  legislative  history\r\n\npersuades us to embrace the unusual.  Congress passed the PLRA in\r\n\n                                9\r\r\n\nan effort, in part, to oust the federal judiciary from day-to-day\r\n\nprison  management.  See 141 Cong.  Rec. 14,419 (1995) (statement\r                                  \r\n\nof  Sen. Abraham)  (\"[N]o longer  will  prison administration  be\r\n\nturned over to  Federal judges for the indefinite  future for the\r\n\nslightest reason.\");  id. at 14,418 (statement of Sen. Hatch) (\"I\r                                   \r\n\nbelieve that  the courts have  gone too far in  micromanaging our\r\n\nNation's prisons.\").  This evidence of ambient intent inclines us\r\n\nto interpret the statute literally  (i.e., as directing courts to\r\n\nterminate  consent decrees  outright), for  it strongly  suggests\r\n\nthat  the  PLRA's   sponsors  wanted  to  truncate   the  federal\r\n\njudiciary's  involvement  in prison  administration.    The House\r\n\nConference Report provides  even more powerful direction  on this\r\n\nscore.   The Report describes  the \"explanation of the  effect of\r\n\nthe  action  agreed  upon by  the  [legislation's]  managers\" and\r\n\nstates that, by virtue of  the PLRA, \"[p]rior consent decrees are\r\n\nmade  terminable upon  the motion  of  either party,  and can  be\r\n\ncontinued  only if  the court  finds that  the imposed  relief is\r\n\nnecessary to correct  the violation of the federal  right.\"  H.R.\r\n\nConf. Rep. No. 104-378 at 166 (1995).  This plain language leaves\r\n\nlittle room for doubt  that Congress intended the PLRA  as a last\r\n\nrite for those  consent decrees that  are incapable of  surviving\r\n\nthe rigors of section 3626(b)(2).\r\n\n          Of  course, we recognize  that the plain  meaning rule,\r\n\nwhile a bedrock principle of statutory construction, may yield if\r\n\ngiving  effect to literal meaning would produce a bizarre result.\r\n\nSee Sullivan v. CIA, 992 F.2d 1249, 1252 (1st Cir. 1993); Charles\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                10\r\r\n\nGeorge  Trucking,  823  F.2d  at  688.   But  this  exception  is\r                          \r\n\nsparingly employed, and the circumstances of this case give it no\r\n\npurchase.   The result  that Congress's  plain language  portends\r\n\nhere  involves a  somewhat unusual  use of  terms, but it  is not\r\n\nunreasonable.\r\n\n          We  will  not paint  the  lily.   Given  the congruence\r\n\nbetween  the text  of the  statute  and the  legislature's easily\r\n\ndiscerned  intent, we conclude that Congress meant precisely what\r\n\nit said   however deviant from ordinary  usage that may be   when\r\n\nit wrote the PLRA and specially  defined its operative terms.  We\r\n\nare therefore duty  bound to interpret the PLRA  as mandating the\r\n\ntermination  of  extant  consent  decrees  altogether unless  the\r\n\ndistrict court makes the specific findings that  are necessary to\r\n\nkeep a particular decree alive.2\r\n\nIII.  THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE PLRA\r          III.  THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE PLRA\r\n\n          Having construed the PLRA, we next must essay a de novo\r\n\ndetermination  of whether it  passes constitutional muster.   The\r\n\nplaintiffs  say that the Act's termination provision violates the\r\n\nConstitution three times over by transgressing (1) the separation\r\n\nof  powers principle,  (2) the  Due Process  Clause, and  (3) the\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2Because   Congress   intended  the   PLRA  to   effect  the\r\ntermination of consent decrees, we  need not elaborate upon  what\r\nconsequences might  follow  from the  termination of  prospective\r\nrelief  alone.   We note,  however, that  the Second  Circuit has\r\ninvested   substantial   time    in   exploring   the   potential\r\nramifications of  terminating prospective relief while  leaving a\r\nconsent  decree otherwise intact.  See  Benjamin v. Jacobson,    \r                                                                      \r\nF.3d     ,      (2d  Cir.  1997)  [1997  WL 523896,  at  *15-16].\r\nInasmuch as our interpretation of  the PLRA obviates the need for\r\nany  such exercise,  we  take  no view  of  the Benjamin  court's\r                                                                  \r\nconclusions.\r\n\n                                11\r\r\n\nEqual Protection  Clause.  Though  ably presented, none  of these\r\n\nassertions carries the day.\r\n\n                    A.  Separation of Powers.\r                              A.  Separation of Powers.\r                                                      \r\n\n          Few  tenets  are  more  central to  the  genius  of our\r\n\nconstitutional  system than the  separation of  powers principle.\r\n\nSee  O'Donoghue  v.  United  States,  289 U.S.  516,  530  (1933)\r                                             \r\n\n(describing  separation of  powers as  \"basic  and vital\"  to our\r\n\nscheme of government).  This principle has many incarnations.  In\r\n\none  such   configuration,  it   insulates  the   judiciary  from\r\n\nunwarranted legislative intrusions.\r\n\n          The  courts' historic independence has its roots in the\r\n\nConstitution,  which  explicitly  provides  that \"[t]he  judicial\r\n\nPower of the United States shall  be vested in one Supreme Court,\r\n\nand in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time\r\n\nordain  and  establish.\"    U.S.  Const. art.  III,     1.   This\r\n\ndelegation of power serves \"to safeguard litigants' right to have\r\n\nclaims   decided  before  judges  who  are  free  from  potential\r\n\ndomination by other  branches of government.\"   Commodity Futures\r                                                                           \r\n\nTrading Comm'n v.  Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 848  (1986) (citation and\r                                  \r\n\ninternal quotation  marks omitted).   The  due administration  of\r\n\njustice  demands  that  this separation  remain  inviolate.   The\r\n\nplaintiffs  lament that  the  PLRA  infringes  upon  the  courts'\r\n\nguaranteed separateness in two distinct ways.\r\n\n          1.    Reopening  Final Judgments.    The  separation of\r                    1.    Reopening  Final Judgments.\r                                                    \r\n\npowers  principle  forbids  Congress  from  reopening  the  final\r\n\njudgments of Article III courts.   See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm,\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                12\r\r\n\nInc., 514  U.S. 211, 240 (1995).   After all,  if the judiciary's\r              \r\n\npower   to   render   definitive  judgments   were   subject   to\r\n\ncongressional control,  then the  judiciary would  become, within\r\n\nits own sphere, subordinate to the legislature.\r\n\n          Moving   from  the  general   to  the  particular,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs  maintain  that  the PLRA  offends  this  principle by\r\n\nrequiring a  district  court to  rescind  relief that  the  court\r\n\nalready  has seen fit  to award.  In  mounting this argument, the\r\n\nplaintiffs rely heavily on the Justices' observation, made in  an\r\n\nearlier round  of this  litigation, that \"a  consent decree  is a\r\n\nfinal  judgment that  may be  reopened  only to  the extent  that\r\n\nequity requires.\"  Rufo, 502 U.S. at  391.  From this thread, the\r                                 \r\n\nplaintiffs   weave  a  syllogism:    Congress  cannot  order  the\r\n\nreopening  of final judgments without offending the separation of\r\n\npowers  principle,  a consent  decree  is a  final  judgment, and\r\n\ntherefore  Congress  cannot  mandate  the  reopening  of  consent\r\n\ndecrees.\r\n\n          This  reasoning  frays because  consent decrees  of the\r\n\ntype at issue here are not \"final judgments\" for the purpose of a\r\n\nseparation of powers  analysis.  In a recent  articulation of the\r\n\nrule that the  legislature cannot interfere with  final judgments\r\n\nof Article III courts, the  Supreme Court carefully carved out an\r\n\nexception  and endorsed a  line of cases  sanctioning legislation\r\n\n\"that  altered the prospective  effect of injunctions  entered by\r\n\nArticle III courts.\"  Plaut, 514 U.S. at 232.  This exception did\r                                     \r\n\nnot  spring  full-blown  from  Justice Scalia's  brow.    To  the\r\n\n                                13\r\r\n\ncontrary, its roots burrow deep into our constitutional soil.  An\r\n\nearly exemplar is Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont  Bridge Co.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n59 U.S. (18 How.) 421 (1855).  That hoary case  established that,\r\n\nalthough a judgment at law is impervious  to legislative assault,\r\n\na forward-looking judgment  in equity can succumb  to legislative\r\n\naction if the legislature alters the underlying rule of law.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid. at  431-32.   More recent  examples also  exist.  See,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nLandgraf v.  USI Film  Prods., 511 U.S.  244, 273  (1994); System\r                                                                           \r\n\nFed'n No. 91 v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 651-52 (1961).\r                                \r\n\n          Lower courts sometimes are required to follow precedent\r\n\nfor precedent's sake, no matter how much the yoke  chafes.  Here,\r\n\nhowever,  our burden is light,  for the Wheeling Bridge exception\r                                                                 \r\n\nis not only  mandated by precedent but also  makes logical sense.\r\n\nThe legitimacy  of prospective  equitable relief  rests upon  the\r\n\npresumed persistence  of the conditions that originally justified\r\n\nthe   relief.    If  forward-looking  judgments  in  equity  were\r\n\ninviolate, then one  of two scenarios would develop:   either the\r\n\nlegislature   would  be  stripped   of  the  ability   to  change\r\n\nsubstantive law  once an injunction  had been issued  pursuant to\r\n\nthat law,  or an issued  injunction would continue to  have force\r\n\nafter the law  that originally gave the injunction legitimacy had\r\n\nbeen found  wanting (and,  hence, altered).   The first  of these\r\n\npossible results would  work an undue judicial  interference with\r\n\nthe  legislative  process,  while  the  second  would  create  an\r\n\nintolerable tangle in which some laws applied to some persons and\r\n\nnot to  others.   Since the separation  of powers principle  is a\r\n\n                                14\r\r\n\ntwo-way street,  courts must  be careful not  to embrace  a legal\r\n\nregime that promotes such awkward scenarios.\r\n\n          To recapitulate, consent  decrees are final  judgments,\r\n\nbut they are  final judgments subject to revision  \"to the extent\r\n\nthat  equity  requires.\"   Rufo,  502  U.S. at  391.    Plaut and\r                                                                       \r\n\nWheeling Bridge, read  together, teach that equity  requires, and\r                         \r\n\nthe separation  of  powers  principle  permits,  legislatures  to\r\n\ndirect  that courts  respond  to changes  in  substantive law  by\r\n\nrevisiting forward-looking injunctions.  See Plyler v. Moore, 100\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 365,  371 (4th Cir. 1996).  The  Court stated the point with\r\n\ngreat clarity earlier in this litigation:  \"A consent decree must\r\n\nof course be modified if, as it  later turns out, one or more  of\r\n\nthe  obligations  [it  imposes]  has  become  impermissible under\r\n\nfederal law.\"  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388.\r                             \r\n\n          The  plaintiffs try  to turn  these  verities to  their\r\n\nadvantage by asserting that the  underlying law here   the Eighth\r\n\nAmendment   has not changed.  This is resupinate reasoning.   The\r\n\nrelevant underlying law in this case is not the Eighth Amendment,\r\n\nas  there  has  been  no finding  of  an  ongoing  constitutional\r\n\nviolation.   Rather, the relevant  underlying law relates  to the\r\n\ndistrict  court's  authority to  issue  and maintain  prospective\r\n\nrelief absent  a violation of  a federal right, and  the PLRA has\r\n\ntruncated  that authority.   See  Benjamin v. Jacobson,      F.3d\r                                                                \r\n\n   ,     (2d Cir. 1997) [1997 WL 523896, at *9].  The termination\r\n\nof a  consent decree in  response to the PLRA,  therefore, merely\r\n\neffectuates  Congress's decision to divest district courts of the\r\n\n                                15\r\r\n\nability to  construct or  perpetuate prospective  relief when  no\r\n\nviolation of  a federal right  exists.   Given this shift  in the\r\n\nrelevant underlying  law, the  termination of  prospective relief\r\n\npursuant to the  PLRA does not amount to  a legislative reopening\r\n\nof a final judgment.\r\n\n          2.  Rules  of Decision.   The  plaintiffs next  contend\r                    2.

Klein,  80 U.S. (13 Wall.)  128 (1871).  Klein  had its\r                                                                  \r\n\ngenesis in the aftermath of the Civil War, when Congress passed a\r\n\nstatute  that permitted  noncombatant  Confederate landowners  to\r\n\nrecover  confiscated goods  upon proof  of their  loyalty  to the\r\n\nUnion.   Klein,  the administrator  of  the estate  of Wilson,  a\r\n\nConfederate sympathizer,  attempted  to  recover  Wilson's  goods\r\n\npursuant to  this statute.   Mindful that  the Supreme  Court had\r\n\npreviously  declared that  a presidential  pardon was  conclusive\r\n\nproof  of loyalty,  see United  States v.  Padelford, 76  U.S. (9\r                                                              \r\n\nWall.)  531 (1869),  Klein  tendered  evidence  that  Wilson  had\r\n\nreceived such  a pardon.   While the  case was  pending, Congress\r\n\npassed a  statute which declared  that a presidential  pardon was\r\n\nproof of  disloyalty and  directed the  dismissal of any  pending\r\n\nrecovery action  brought on  behalf of a  pardon recipient.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nKlein, 80 U.S. at 131-34.\r               \r\n\n          The  Supreme  Court  invalidated  the  new  statute  on\r\n\nseparation  of powers  grounds.  It  ruled that  if the  law were\r\n\nallowed to stand,  then the trial court  would have \"jurisdiction\r\n\n                                16\r\r\n\nof the  cause to  a given point;  but when  it ascertains  that a\r\n\ncertain state of things exists,  its jurisdiction is to cease and\r\n\nit is  required to dismiss  the cause for want  of jurisdiction.\"\r\n\nId.  at 146.   Such  a  requirement \"is  not an  exercise  of the\r             \r\n\nacknowledged power of  Congress to make exceptions  and prescribe\r\n\nregulations to the appellate power\" and  thus \"passe[s] the limit\r\n\nwhich separates the legislative from the judicial power.\"  Id. at\r                                                                        \r\n\n146-47.   The  Klein  Court distinguished  Wheeling  Bridge as  a\r                                                                     \r\n\nsituation  in which  \"the court  was left  to apply  its ordinary\r\n\nrules to  the new  circumstances created by  the act  [whereas in\r\n\nKlein] no  new circumstances  have been  created by  legislation.\r               \r\n\nBut the  court is forbidden to give the effect to evidence which,\r\n\nin its own  judgment, such evidence should have,  and is directed\r\n\nto give it an effect precisely contrary.\"  Id. at 147.\r                                                        \r\n\n          The  plaintiffs argue that  the case at  hand resembles\r\n\nKlein  more than Wheeling  Bridge because the  law underlying the\r                                           \r\n\nconsent decree   the Eighth Amendment   remains constant, yet the\r\n\nPLRA  imposes  a  rule  of  decision  by  instructing  courts  to\r\n\nterminate  prospective relief.   This argument  misapprehends the\r\n\nsituation.   As  noted  above, the  relevant  underlying law  for\r\n\npresent purposes  is not the  Eighth Amendment, but the  power of\r\n\nfederal courts to grant prospective relief absent  a violation of\r\n\na  federal right.   Thus, the  PLRA does  not run afoul  of Klein\r                                                                           \r\n\nbecause it does  not tamper with courts' decisional  rules   that\r\n\nis,  courts remain  free to interpret  and apply  the law  to the\r\n\nfacts as they  discern them.  Because the PLRA leaves the courts'\r\n\n                                17\r\r\n\nadjudicatory processes intact,  it does not transgress  the Klein\r                                                                           \r\n\ndoctrine.   See Gavin v.  Barnstad,      F.3d    ,      (8th Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1997) [1997 WL 434633, at *7-8].\r\n\n                         B.  Due Process.\r                                   B.  Due Process.\r                                                  \r\n\n          The  plaintiffs base their  next two objections  on the\r\n\nDue Process Clause.   The first rests  on the postulate that  the\r\n\nconsent decree is a final  judgment, the existence of which vests\r\n\nproperty  rights  in the  parties  that  cannot be  alienated  by\r\n\nCongress.    By  purporting to  terminate  consent  decrees, this\r\n\nthesis runs, the  PLRA not only reopens final  judgments but also\r\n\nrobs  the  judgments'  beneficiaries of  rights  secured  to them\r\n\nthereunder.   The plaintiffs'  second objection  posits that  the\r\n\n1979 consent decree constitutes a  contract and that due  process\r\n\nlimits  the extent  to  which the  federal  government can  enact\r\n\nlegislation  that  has  a   deleterious  effect  on   preexisting\r\n\ncontracts.  Both objections lack force.\r\n\n          1.   Vested Rights.   The  plaintiffs' first  objection\r                    1.   Vested Rights.\r                                      \r\n\nfails  because,   at  least   in  the   absence  of   exceptional\r\n\ncircumstances  well beyond  any that  are  present here,  frankly\r\n\nmodifiable  decrees cannot create  vested rights.   See Landgraf,\r                                                                          \r\n\n511 U.S.  at 273 (noting  that \"relief by injunction  operates in\r\n\nfuturo, and  that [a party]  ha[s] no vested right  in the decree\r\n\nentered by  the trial  court\") (citation  and internal  quotation\r\n\nmarks omitted).  As we  have already pointed out, consent decrees\r\n\nare not  merely final  judgments, but a  special species  of that\r\n\ngenre   final judgments that can be \"reopened . . . to the extent\r\n\n                                18\r\r\n\nthat equity requires.\"   Rufo, 502 U.S.  at 391.  In  the instant\r                                       \r\n\ncase,  equity requires  termination of  the  1979 decree  because\r\n\nCongress has withdrawn  the power that animated the  decree.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\n18 U.S.C.A.   3626(a)(1)(A), (b)(2).\r\n\n          To be sure, the plaintiffs argue that this reasoning is\r\n\ncircular.  But, given the tenuous nature of consent decrees, that\r\n\nargument will not wash.   There is a  basic difference between  a\r\n\nmoney  judgment and  a  consent  decree:   the  former is  fixed,\r\n\nwhereas the latter is necessarily impermanent.  Thus, insofar  as\r\n\na consent  decree has  prospective effect, it  must on  motion be\r\n\nadjusted  to accommodate material changes of  fact or law germane\r\n\nto its issuance.3  See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 393.  Here, the PLRA has\r                                     \r\n\naltered the standard by which courts can continue forward-looking\r\n\nrelief, and this profound  change in the relevant underlying  law\r\n\nentitles the defendants to termination of the decree.\r\n\n          2.   Contract  Rights.    The  plaintiffs'  second  due\r                    2.   Contract  Rights.\r                                         \r\n\nprocess objection  is equally  unavailing.  Even  if we  make two\r\n\nbroad assumptions  that are integral to their  position   namely,\r\n\nthat the consent decree is  a contract and that the PLRA  impairs\r\n\nthat contract     the  objection  founders.   The  Supreme  Court\r\n\ndelineated  the standard of  review for federal  legislation that\r\n\nimpairs contractual relations in National R.R. Passenger Corp. v.\r                                                                        \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3This  precept  could  not   come  as  a  surprise   to  the\r\nplaintiffs.   In  the  last modification  of the  consent decree,\r\nunder  date of  June 14,  1994,  the district  court advised  the\r\nparties that it would entertain  future motions to modify \"upon a\r\nshowing of good cause . . .  or upon a showing of material change\r\nin circumstances.\"\r\n\n                                19\r\r\n\nAtchison,  Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co.,  470 U.S. 451 (1985).  If a\r                                              \r\n\nsubstantial  impairment of a contract right  is found or assumed,\r\n\n\"the reviewing court next determines whether the impairment is of\r\n\nconstitutional  dimension.\"   Id. at  472.   It  engages in  this\r                                           \r\n\nanalysis by  examining the statute and identifying the parties to\r\n\nthe contract.   See id.  \"When the contract is a private one, and\r                                 \r\n\nwhen the impairing statute is a federal one, this next inquiry is\r\n\nespecially limited, and the judicial scrutiny quite minimal.  The\r\n\nparty  asserting a  Fifth Amendment  due  process violation  must\r\n\novercome a  presumption of  constitutionality and  establish that\r\n\nthe legislature  has acted in  an arbitrary and  irrational way.\"\r\n\nId. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\r             \r\n\n          Even  though the federal  government is not  a party to\r\n\nthe \"contract\" in issue here (the consent decree), the plaintiffs\r\n\nseek to upgrade the level of scrutiny.  Their gambit depends upon\r\n\nthe Court's  opinion  in Garcia  v.  San Antonio  Metro.  Transit\r                                                                           \r\n\nAuth.,  469 U.S.  528 (1985),  which,  they say,  stands for  the\r               \r\n\nproposition that the states have sufficient representation in the\r\n\nfederal  government  to  influence  its  actions,  and  that,  by\r\n\nextension, the  federal sovereign's actions  should be attributed\r\n\nto the  states.   From this  coign of  vantage, they  argue that,\r\n\nsince federal laws are enacted  by a government organized for the\r\n\nbenefit  of the  several states,  a  federal act  that impairs  a\r\n\ncontract to  which a  state is  a party  should receive  the same\r\n\ndegree of scrutiny  as a federal  act that impairs a  contract to\r\n\nwhich the United States is a party.\r\n\n                                20\r\r\n\n          This ratiocination  is predicated on a strained reading\r\n\nof Garcia.  The Garcia Court held that state participation in the\r                                \r\n\nfederal  government provides  a sufficient  safeguard to  prevent\r\n\nfederal overreaching  vis- -vis  the states.    See id.  at  552.\r                                                                 \r\n\nThere is,  however, no  basis in Garcia  or elsewhere  to suggest\r                                                 \r\n\nthat  federal legislation  which  benefits state  governments  is\r\n\ntantamount   to  self-dealing  and  thus  subject  to  heightened\r\n\nscrutiny.   We therefore summarily reject the plaintiffs' reading\r\n\nof  Garcia and  the attendant claim  that the  federal government\r                    \r\n\nsomehow became a constructive party to the 1979 consent decree.\r\n\n          This  gets the  grease  from the  goose.   Because  the\r\n\nfederal sovereign is not a party to the consent decree, either in\r\n\nfact  or by  indirection,  we need  only subject  the  PLRA to  a\r\n\nrational basis review.  See  National Passenger, 470 U.S. at 471-\r                                                         \r\n\n72; see also United  States Trust Co. v. New Jersey,  431 U.S. 1,\r                                                             \r\n\n22 (1977) (holding  that \"[l]egislation adjusting the  rights and\r\n\nresponsibilities  of contracting  parties  must  be [based]  upon\r\n\nreasonable  conditions  and  of a  character  appropriate  to the\r\n\npublic purpose justifying its adoption\").\r\n\n          Stressing    that   the    PLRA   abrogates    existing\r\n\nresponsibilities,  the  plaintiffs make  the  obligatory argument\r\n\nthat   the  law  is   arbitrary  and   irrational.     But  these\r\n\nanimadversions vastly  overstate the case.  The PLRA only affects\r\n\nagreements  that   have  at   all  times   remained  subject   to\r\n\nmodification  should  circumstances change.    And,  moreover, by\r\n\nfacilitating termination, the PLRA's termination provision forges\r\n\n                                21\r\r\n\na practical, commonsense linkage between a changed circumstance  \r\n\nthe  district  courts'  newfound inability  to  grant  or enforce\r\n\nprospective relief absent a violation of a federal right   and an\r\n\nexisting  consent  decree.     Consequently,  section  3626(b)(2)\r\n\nsurvives rational basis scrutiny.\r\n\n                      C.  Equal Protection.\r                                C.

First, they  note that pretrial\r\n\ndetainees, by  definition, have  not  yet been  convicted of  the\r\n\ncrime(s) with  which they  have been charged.   Thus,  they enjoy\r\n\nboth the  presumption of innocence,  see In re Winship,  397 U.S.\r                                                                \r\n\n358 (1970),  and the  right not to  be punished  prematurely, see\r                                                                           \r\n\nBell  v.  Wolfish,  441  U.S.  520  (1979).    Building  on  this\r                           \r\n\nfoundation,  the plaintiffs  assert that  the PLRA is  subject to\r\n\nstrict  scrutiny (which  it  fails)  because  it  abridges  these\r\n\nfundamental rights.  In the  alternative, they claim that the Act\r\n\nviolates core  principles of equal  protection because it  has no\r\n\nrational relationship to legitimate state interests.\r\n\n          1.      Fundamental   Rights.      Although  the   PLRA\r                    1.      Fundamental   Rights.\r                                                \r\n\ncircumscribes a  district court's ability  to provide prospective\r\n\nrelief to  pretrial detainees  (as well  as all other  prisoners)\r\n\nabsent  a violation  of a  federal right,  we conclude  that this\r\n\nfeature of the Act does not abridge the pretrial detainees' right\r\n\nto be free  from punishment.   Prison  conditions either  violate\r\n\nfundamental  rights (in which  event they also  violate federally\r\n\nsecured rights)  or they  do not  violate fundamental  rights (in\r\n\n                                22\r\r\n\nwhich event  they do not  violate federally secured rights).   In\r\n\nthe   former  case,  the  PLRA  permits   relief  to  redeem  the\r\n\nfundamental right.  In the latter case, the PLRA does  not permit\r\n\nrelief, but as  no violation exists, the PLRA's  denial of relief\r\n\ndoes not imperil pretrial detainees' fundamental rights.\r\n\n          It is also possible  to argue that the  PLRA implicates\r\n\nthe  fundamental right  of access  to  the courts,  see Wolff  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 578 (1974), and that, by withdrawing the\r                   \r\n\npower to  grant inmates prospective relief in  a manner available\r\n\nto other classes of people,  the PLRA trammels inmates' rights of\r\n\naccess.    This  line  of  reasoning  does  not  withstand  close\r\n\nexamination.  Under  the PLRA, the  courthouse doors remain  open\r\n\nand the withdrawal of prospective  relief   above and beyond what\r\n\nis  necessary to  correct the  violation  of federally  protected\r\n\nrights   does not  diminish the right of access.   In a nutshell,\r\n\nwhile there is  a constitutional right to court  access, there is\r\n\nno complementary constitutional  right to receive or  be eligible\r\n\nfor a particular  form of  relief.  See  Crowder v. Sinyard,  884\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d  804, 814  (5th Cir.  1989), abrogated  on other  grounds by\r                                                                           \r\n\nHorton v.

Rational   Basis.\r                                           \r\n\nconstitutional  challenge  suggests  that the  PLRA  violates the\r\n\nEqual Protection Clause because it \"singl[es] out a certain class\r\n\nof citizens for  disfavored legal status or  general hardship[].\"\r\n\nRomer v. Evans, 116 S. Ct. 1620, 1628 (1996).  This suggestion is\r                        \r\n\nill-conceived.   A statute  that neither  abridges a  fundamental\r\n\n                                23\r\r\n\nright  nor operates  against a  suspect  class receives  rational\r\n\nbasis review  when it is  challenged under  the Equal  Protection\r\n\nClause.  See  Heller v. Doe,  509 U.S. 312,  318-19 (1993).   The\r                                     \r\n\nPLRA is such  a statute:  as  we already have explained,  it does\r\n\nnot impair a fundamental right,  and the plaintiffs do not assert\r\n\nthat  pretrial  detainees are  a suspect  class.   Thus, rational\r\n\nbasis review applies.\r\n\n          A  statute survives rationality review if it \"bear[s] a\r\n\nrational   relationship   to   an   independent  and   legitimate\r\n\nlegislative  end.\"   Romer,  116  S. Ct.  at  1627.   The  PLRA's\r                                    \r\n\nlegislative  history indicates that the drafters intended the Act\r\n\nto \"address  the alarming  explosion in  the number of  frivolous\r\n\nlawsuits  filed by State  and Federal  prisoners,\" to  \"mak[e] it\r\n\nmuch more  difficult for Federal judges to issue orders directing\r\n\nthe  release of  convicted criminals  from  prison custody,\"  141\r\n\nCong. Rec. 14,413  (1995) (statement of Sen.

These purposes are clearly  legitimate.  They involve\r\n\nthe allocation  of public  resources, the  maintenance of  public\r\n\nsafety,  and  the  desire  to  institutionalize  a  state-centric\r\n\nconception of  our federal  system.  The  means chosen  to effect\r\n\nthese  ends  are  stern, but  they  certainly  bear a  reasonable\r\n\nrelationship  to  the  announced legislative  goals.    From this\r\n\nperspective, the PLRA easily passes rational basis review.\r\n\n                                24\r\r\n\n          The  plaintiffs try  to  undermine  this  appraisal  by\r\n\nasserting that an anti-inmate animus drove Congress's approval of\r\n\nthe PLRA.   They  claim that  such an invidiously  discriminatory\r\n\nintent  violates the Court's admonition that a legislature cannot\r\n\nconstruct legislation  \"for  the purpose  of  disadvantaging  the\r\n\ngroup burdened  by the law.\"  Romer, 116 S. Ct. at 1628; see also\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States Dep't of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534 (1973)\r                                                 \r\n\n(\"[I]f  the constitutional conception of `equal protection of the\r\n\nlaws' means anything, it must at the  very least mean that a bare\r\n\ncongressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot\r\n\nconstitute a legitimate governmental interest.\").\r\n\n          We need  not grapple  with the  intriguing question  of\r\n\nwhether the  Romer Court meant to add a  new \"animus test\" to the\r                            \r\n\narmamentarium   of  rationality  review.    The  short,  entirely\r\n\ndispositive  answer to the  plaintiffs' supplication is  that the\r\n\nevidence in the record simply  does not show that the legislature\r\n\ninappropriately sought to disadvantage the plaintiff class.\r\n\n          The  only \"proof\" that the plaintiffs offer consists of\r\n\npolitical rhetoric,  such as  the statement  on the  Senate floor\r\n\nthat \"criminals, while they must be accorded their constitutional\r\n\nrights, deserve  to be punished.   Obviously, they should  not be\r\n\ntortured or treated cruelly.  At the same time,  they also should\r\n\nnot have  all the  rights and  privileges the rest  of us  enjoy.\r\n\nRather, their lives  should, on the whole, be  describable by the\r\n\nold concept known as `hard time.'\"  141 Cong. Rec.  14,419 (1995)\r\n\n(statement of Sen. Abraham).  Passing the obvious point that such\r\n\n                                25\r\r\n\nrhetoric must  be taken with a grain of salt   elected officials,\r\n\nafter all, have been known to strike poses for public consumption\r\n\n   the most that fairly can be said  is that oratory of this sort\r\n\nmay  evince  a   philosophical  shift;  it  hardly   betokens  an\r\n\nimpermissible animus.   In all  events, the state is  well within\r\n\nits  right  to  punish   persons  convicted  of  crimes,   and  a\r\n\nretributive  desire to  effect such punishment  consequently does\r\n\nnot   offend  any  supposed  \"animus  test.\"    Furthermore,  the\r\n\nplaintiffs are not  criminals, but pretrial detainees;  they have\r\n\nnot been found guilty of any crimes.  Thus, even if the political\r\n\nrhetoric  spotlighted  by  the  plaintiffs  qualified  as  animus\r\n\ndirected  at criminals, it would not constitute cognizable animus\r\n\nfor present purposes.\r\n\n          In sum, an objective reading of the legislative history\r\n\ndemonstrates that the plaintiffs' inability to obtain prospective\r\n\nrelief does not spring from Congress's wish  to do them harm, but\r\n\nfrom its  desire to minimize  the occasion for federal  courts to\r\n\nadminister  state prisons.    Consequently,  the  PLRA  does  not\r\n\nsuccumb to  any theoretical  \"animus test\"  contained within  the\r\n\nEqual Protection Clause.\r\n\nIV.  APPLYING THE PLRA\r          IV.  APPLYING THE PLRA\r\n\n          The  plaintiffs have a fallback position.  They contend\r\n\nthat, even if the PLRA is constitutional, the 1979 consent decree\r\n\nshould  remain intact because  (1) the district  court previously\r\n\nmade findings sufficient  to save the decree by  operation of the\r\n\nAct, see 18 U.S.C.A.   3626(b)(2), or (2) if the findings to date\r                  \r\n\n                                26\r\r\n\nare  inadequate,  the  district court  should  have  conducted an\r\n\ninquiry into  whether  a  violation  of a  federal  right  exists\r\n\ncurrently (or probably will come into existence if the strictures\r\n\nof the consent decree are lifted) before  implementing the PLRA's\r\n\ntermination provision.  We reject both contentions.\r\n\n          Answering  the  question of  whether  prison conditions\r\n\nconstitute an ongoing violation of a federal right under the PLRA\r\n\nnecessitates  both a  definition of  the  right at  stake and  an\r\n\nassessment  of  a  specific   compendium  of  prison  conditions.\r\n\nAccordingly, such a  question comprises a mixed  question of fact\r\n\nand  law, the  answer  to  which we  review  \"along a  degree-of-\r\n\ndeference  continuum,  ranging  from  plenary  review   for  law-\r\n\ndominated  questions  to  clear-error review  for  fact-dominated\r\n\nquestions.\"  Johnson  v. Watts Regulator Co., 63  F.3d 1129, 1132\r                                                      \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1995).   Here, the question is more factual than legal:\r\n\ninasmuch as the double bunking  of pretrial detainees does not in\r\n\nand of itself violate the  Constitution, see Bell v. Wolfish, 441\r                                                                      \r\n\nU.S. at  541, the  district  court's conclusion  that the  double\r\n\nbunking of  which the plaintiffs  continue to complain is  not in\r\n\nviolation  of a  federal right  must  be challenged,  if at  all,\r\n\nprincipally on the facts.  Thus, the standard of review is highly\r\n\ndeferential.  See Huguley v.  General Motors Corp., 999 F.2d 142,\r                                                            \r\n\n146 (6th Cir. 1993).\r\n\n          We  have carefully reviewed  the record and  culled out\r\n\nthe sparse factual  findings that the court made  in the relevant\r\n\ntime frame.  No useful purpose would be served by examining these\r\n\n                                27\r\r\n\nfindings in minute detail.   Judge Keeton concluded that they did\r\n\nnot satisfy the  requirements of section 3626(a) or (b).   See D.\r                                                                           \r\n\nCt. Op., 952 F. Supp. at 880.  A trial court generally is thought\r                 \r\n\nto be the best interpreter of its own prior rulings and findings,\r\n\nsee,   e.g.,  Martha's  Vineyard   Scuba  Headquarters,  Inc.  v.\r                                                                       \r\n\nUnidentified,  Wrecked &amp; Abandoned  Steam Vessel, 833  F.2d 1059,\r                                                          \r\n\n1066-67 (1st Cir. 1987);  Lefkowitz v. Fair, 816 F.2d 17, 22 (1st\r                                                     \r\n\nCir. 1987), and this case is no exception.  At any rate, we agree\r\n\nwith Judge  Keeton's conclusion.    It is  simply implausible  to\r\n\nsuggest, on this record, that  the district court's assessment of\r\n\nthe existing factual findings is clearly erroneous.\r\n\n          The  plaintiffs'  follow-on  argument   gains  them  no\r\n\nground.  As  to the conditions that presently exist,  we defer to\r\n\nthe  district court's  intimate familiarity with  this protracted\r\n\nlitigation  and  to  its informed  evaluation  of  current prison\r\n\nconditions.  See D. Ct. Op., 952 F. Supp. at 880  (observing that\r                                     \r\n\n\"no  evidence  is  before  the court  to  support  findings  that\r\n\ndefendants are not  in compliance with the terms  of the modified\r\n\nConsent  Decree\").    Deference  is  especially appropriate  here\r\n\nsince, under the  terms of an order  that it entered on  June 14,\r\n\n1994, the  district court  for some time  had been  receiving and\r\n\nevaluating periodic reports from the Sheriff concerning incidents\r\n\nof assaultive behavior, rape, disease, and the like at the Nashua\r\n\nStreet jail.\r\n\n          As  to what the  future may bring,  we cannot criticize\r\n\nJudge Keeton's reluctance to play the oracle.  Presented with the\r\n\n                                28\r\r\n\nopportunity  to  make  further   findings  before  deciding   the\r\n\ndefendants' motions, the judge declined.  He noted several cogent\r\n\nreasons  why it  made sense to  leave the  question of  whether a\r\n\nviolation of  a  federal right  might follow  the termination  of\r\n\nprospective relief under the consent  decree to another day.  See\r                                                                           \r\n\nid.\r             \r\n\n          We discern no error.   This is neither the time nor the\r\n\nplace to press  an inherently speculative claim of  harm to come.\r\n\nThe PLRA  imposes no  obligation on  the  trial court  to make  a\r\n\npredictive inquiry  into future conditions before  terminating an\r\n\nexisting consent decree, and we are not aware of  any other basis\r\n\nfor burdening  the court with  such a requirement.   Quite often,\r\n\n\"[p]resent fears  are less  than horrible  imaginings.\"   William\r\n\nShakespeare, Macbeth, act 1, sc. 3 (1605).  If, in this instance,\r                              \r\n\nthe plaintiffs' trepidation proves justified, they remain free to\r\n\ninitiate a new  round of proceedings designed to  show that post-\r\n\ntermination prison conditions actually do violate their federally\r\n\nprotected rights.\r\n\nV.  VACATING THE CONSENT DECREE\r          V.  VACATING THE CONSENT DECREE\r\n\n          Having  construed the  PLRA  and established  that  its\r\n\ntermination-of-prospective-relief provision passes constitutional\r\n\nmuster, that the conditions for  exemption have not been met, and\r\n\nthat the Act's mandate  requires the district court to  terminate\r\n\nthe consent decree,  we now mull whether that  mandate means that\r\n\nan order must be entered  not only terminating the consent decree\r\n\nbut actually vacating it.  The  district court thought not.   See\r                                                                           \r\n\n                                29\r\r\n\nD. Ct. Op., 952 F. Supp. at 883-84.  We agree.\r                    \r\n\n          The  defendants'   opposition  is   easily  dispatched.\r\n\nNothing in the PLRA or its legislative history speaks of vacating\r\n\nconsent decrees.  Congress chose  to use the verb \"terminate\" and\r\n\nto eschew the  verb \"vacate.\"  The distinction  between these two\r\n\nwords is clear:   \"terminate\"  means \"to  put an end  to\" or  \"to\r\n\nend,\"  Black's Law Dictionary at 1471, whereas \"vacate\" means \"to\r                                       \r\n\nannul\" or \"to render . . . void,\" id. at 1548.\r                                               \r\n\n          In  the  present  context, this  distinction  may  well\r\n\npossess practical  significance.  Cf.  Benjamin,     F.3d  at    \r                                                         \r\n\n[1997 WL 523896, at *15-16]  (explaining that court's view of the\r\n\ndistinction between terminating prospective relief and vacating a\r\n\nconsent decree).  While terminating a consent decree strips it of\r\n\nfuture  potency, the  decree's past  puissance  is preserved  and\r\n\ncertain of its collateral effects may endure.  Vacating a consent\r\n\ndecree,  however, wipes the  slate clean, not  only rendering the\r\n\ndecree sterile  for future  purposes, but  also eviscerating  any\r\n\ncollateral effects and, indeed, casting a shadow on past  actions\r\n\ntaken under the decree's imprimatur.  As nothing in the PLRA even\r\n\nhints  that  consent  decrees must  be  vacated  when prospective\r\n\nrelief is terminated,  we uphold the district court's ruling that\r\n\nthe PLRA does not require vacation of the 1979 decree.\r\n\nVI.  CONCLUSION\r          VI.  CONCLUSION\r\n\n          We need go no further.   To the extent that the parties\r\n\nadvance  other arguments,  we  reject  them out  of  hand.   None\r\n\n                                30\r\r\n\nrequires elaboration.4\r\n\n          For the reasons stated herein, we affirm so much of the\r\n\njudgment below that (a) found  the PLRA to be constitutional, (b)\r\n\nterminated  all prospective relief under the 1979 consent decree,\r\n\nand (c) refused to vacate that decree.   We direct, however, that\r\n\nthe judgment be  revised to terminate  the consent decree  itself\r\n\nand  we  remand for  the entry of  a modified judgment  (together\r\n\nwith such further proceedings, if  any, as the district court may\r\n\ndeem necessary in light of this opinion).\r\n\n          Affirmed as modified  and remanded.  All  parties shall\r                    Affirmed as modified  and remanded.  All  parties shall\r                                                                           \r\n\nbear their own costs.\r          bear their own costs.\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4The  Commissioner  moved  below for  vacation  of  the 1979\r\nconsent decree under Fed.  R. Civ. P. 60(b)  and now appeals  the\r\ndenial of that  motion.  We need  not address that aspect  of the\r\nmatter.  At oral argument  in this court, the Commissioner agreed\r\nthat if the consent decree were to be terminated, the  Rule 60(b)\r\nissue could  be set to one side.  We take the Commissioner at his\r\nword and  therefore express  no opinion as  to the merits  of the\r\nRule 60(b) claim.\r\n\n                                31\r\r\n",

In its wake, the Sheriff of Suffolk County and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Correction (collectively, the defendants) cast their gaze toward a consent decree that has governed important aspects of the county's handling of pretrial detainees since 1979.  Spying an opportunity to sever the shackles of judicial oversight, the defendants invoked the new law and asked the supervising tribunal, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, to vacate the decree or, in the alternative, to terminate all prospective relief under it.  The plaintiffs questioned the Act's constitutionality and raised a host of other objections to the defendants' motions.  The district court repulsed the constitutional attack but construed the PLRA to require only the termination of prospective relief, not the vacatur of the consent decree itself.  See Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Sheriff of Suffolk County, 952 F.Supp. 869 (D.Mass.1997) (D.Ct.Op.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful consideration of the meaning of the PLRA, we vouchsafe the Act's constitutionality against the challenges asserted here and construe it to entitle correctional officials to the termination of existing consent decrees in civil actions involving prison conditions (except in the presence of statutorily prescribed conditions that forestall such termination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This litigation deals almost exclusively with the effect of the PLRA on an extant consent decree.  Thus, the history of the conflict is of minimal import, and we merely sketch it.  The shelves of any reasonably well-stocked law library afford readers who hunger for more exegetic detail ample opportunity to dine elsewhere.  See, e.g., Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Eisenstadt, 360 F.Supp. 676, 679-84 (D.Mass.1973), aff'd, 494 F.2d 1196 (1st Cir.1974);  Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Kearney, 734 F.Supp. 561, 562-63 (D.Mass.), aff'd, 915 F.2d 1557 (1st Cir.1990) (table), vacated, 502 U.S. 367, 112 S.Ct. 748, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992);  Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v.

After extensive skirmishing, not relevant here, the parties reached a rapprochement, subsequently approved by the district court and embodied in the 1979 consent decree, in which they ratified an architectural plan for a new facility featuring single-occupancy cells.  The agreement contemplated the phasing-out of the existing Charles Street jail once the new structure was in place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Scottish poet warned, \"the best laid schemes o' mice and men gang aft a-gley,\" Robert Burns, To a Mouse (1785), and in this case time proved a formidable opponent.  Growth in prison population and delays in construction both exceeded expectations.  The new facility (the Nashua Street jail) was not completed until mid-1990 and was hard-pressed from the start to cope with the Sheriff's escalating needs.  In response to these volatile conditions, the consent decree was modified by court order in 1985, 1990, and 1994.  The last of these changes permitted limited double bunking at the Nashua Street facility (the Sheriff having closed the Charles Street facility prior thereto).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1996 the Sheriff initiated the current engagement.  He grasped the weapon that Congress had forged and moved to terminate all prospective relief pursuant to the PLRA.  Not to be outdone, the Commissioner moved to vacate the consent decree outright, thus formalizing a suggestion that the Sheriff had omitted from his motion but had included in the memorandum supporting the motion.  When the plaintiffs indicated that they would challenge the Act's constitutionality as part of their opposition, the federal government intervened.  After sorting out the components of the parties' extensive asseverational array, Judge Keeton gave the pertinent provisions of the PLRA a narrowing construction and on that basis upheld their constitutionality.  He thereupon granted the Sheriff's motion to the extent that the consent decree would \"no longer be enforced by an order of specific performance,\" but declined either to vacate the decree or to \"terminate the obligations stated [therein]\" because those obligations represented \"consensual undertakings of the defendants with court approval.\"  Id. at 883.   All parties appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to cut a passable swath through this legal thicket, we start by construing the termination provision of the PLRA.  We then test its constitutionality and, finding no merit in the plaintiffs' constitutional challenges, apply the Act and evaluate the extent of the remediation to which the defendants are entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE PLRA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In parsing the PLRA, we afford de novo review.  See United States v. Gifford, 17 F.3d 462, 471-72 (1st Cir.1994).  Such an exercise in statutory interpretation always begins with the language of the statute itself.  See Stowell v. Ives, 976 F.2d 65, 69 (1st Cir.1992).  At this stage, an inquisitive court should assume that the words of the statute, if not specially defined, comport with their ordinary meaning, and that the words, so read, accurately express the legislature's intent.  See FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U.S. 52, 57, 111 S.Ct. 403, 407, 112 L.Ed.2d 356 (1990).  In keeping with this principle, the court should \"resort to legislative history and other aids of statutory construction only when the literal words of the statute create ambiguity or lead to an unreasonable result.\"  United States v. Charles George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir.1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PLRA is not a paragon of clarity.  In regard to existing federal court orders, it declares that \"in any civil action with respect to prison conditions, a defendant or intervenor shall be entitled to the immediate termination of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the absence of a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\"  18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3626(b)(2).  Such prospective relief shall not terminate, however, \"if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current or ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\"  Id. &#167; 3626(b)(3).  With regard to relief not yet obtained, the Act contains similar proscriptions.  It forbids courts from granting or approving prospective relief \"unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\"  Id. &#167; 3626(a)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These iterations are clear enough, but uncertainty arises when we examine the Act's definitional instructions.  One such passage defines \"prospective relief\" to include \"all relief other than compensatory monetary damages,\" and then defines \"relief\" to \"mean[ ] all relief in any form that may be granted or approved by the court ... includ[ing] consent decrees.\"  Id. &#167; 3626(g)(7), (9).  \"Consent decree,\" in turn, means \"any relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but does not include private settlements.\"  Id. &#167; 3626(b)(1).  In a vacuum, the interaction of the Act's mechanics and these definitions is manageable:  terminating \"prospective relief\" as prescribed by section 3626(b)(2) would terminate \"all relief,\" see section 3626(g)(7), which under section 3626(g)(9) \"includes consent decrees.\"   Read literally, therefore, once defendants or intervenors show their entitlement to terminate prospective relief, the Act seemingly requires termination of the consent decree itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court astutely observed, this result is counterintuitive in that it contradicts the usual understanding of both \"relief\" and \"consent decree.\"   See D. Ct. Op., 952 F.Supp. at 878.   The customary definition of \"consent decree\" likens such decrees to judgments, see Black's Law Dictionary 410 (6th ed.1990) (defining \"consent decree\" as \"[a] judgment entered by consent of the parties whereby the defendant agrees to stop alleged illegal activity without admitting guilt or wrongdoing\"), and in ordinary usage a judgment is \"[a] final decision of the court resolving the dispute and determining the rights and obligations of the parties,\" id. at 841-42.  \"Relief,\" on the other hand, typically is equated with \"remedy,\" id. at 1292, which is \"the means by which a right is enforced or the violation of a right is prevented, redressed, or compensated,\" id. at 1294.   Inasmuch as a remedy effectuates the adjudication expressed in a judgment, one ordinarily would assume that \"relief,\" by extension, effectuates the legal decision, arrived at by consent, in a \"consent decree.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress conflated the two terms when it described consent decrees as a form of relief rather than as a judgment that engenders relief.  The PLRA's equation of \"consent decree\" and \"relief\" contradicts conventional understandings and creates a situation in which a strict, language-based construction of the PLRA requires that commonplace legal terms be used in curious ways.  This circumstance fosters uncertainty, for a court cannot really tell, without further inquiry, whether the linguistic anomaly is accidental or purposeful (and, thus, whether Congress meant to uproot consent decrees themselves or merely to vitiate the relief attendant to them, when it directed federal courts to facilitate \"the immediate termination of any prospective relief\" at the behest of prison litigation defendants and intervenors).  This uncertainty impels us to consult extrinsic sources in search of guidance as to Congress's intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the PLRA's legislative history persuades us to embrace the unusual.  Congress passed the PLRA in an effort, in part, to oust the federal judiciary from day-to-day prison management.  See 141 Cong.  Rec. 14,419 (1995) (statement of Sen.  Abraham) (\"[N]o longer will prison administration be turned over to Federal judges for the indefinite future for the slightest reason.\");  id. at 14,418 (statement of Sen.  Hatch) (\"I believe that the courts have gone too far in micromanaging our Nation's prisons.\").  This evidence of ambient intent inclines us to interpret the statute literally (i.e., as directing courts to terminate consent decrees outright), for it strongly suggests that the PLRA's sponsors wanted to truncate the federal judiciary's involvement in prison administration.  The House Conference Report provides even more powerful direction on this score.  The Report describes the \"explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the [legislation's] managers\" and states that, by virtue of the PLRA, \"[p]rior consent decrees are made terminable upon the motion of either party, and can be continued only if the court finds that the imposed relief is necessary to correct the violation of the federal right.\"   H.R. Conf.  Rep. No. 104-378 at 166 (1995).  This plain language leaves little room for doubt that Congress intended the PLRA as a last rite for those consent decrees that are incapable of surviving the rigors of section 3626(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, we recognize that the plain meaning rule, while a bedrock principle of statutory construction, may yield if giving effect to literal meaning would produce a bizarre result.  See Sullivan v. CIA, 992 F.2d 1249, 1252 (1st Cir.1993);  Charles George Trucking, 823 F.2d at 688.   But this exception is sparingly employed, and the circumstances of this case give it no purchase.  The result that Congress's plain language portends here involves a somewhat unusual use of terms, but it is not unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Given the congruence between the text of the statute and the legislature's easily discerned intent, we conclude that Congress meant precisely what it said--however deviant from ordinary usage that may be--when it wrote the PLRA and specially defined its operative terms.  We are therefore duty bound to interpret the PLRA as mandating the termination of extant consent decrees altogether unless the district court makes the specific findings that are necessary to keep a particular decree alive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE PLRA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having construed the PLRA, we next must essay a de novo determination of whether it passes constitutional muster.  The plaintiffs say that the Act's termination provision violates the Constitution three times over by transgressing (1) the separation of powers principle, (2) the Due Process Clause, and (3) the Equal Protection Clause.  Though ably presented, none of these assertions carries the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>A. Separation of Powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Few tenets are more central to the genius of our constitutional system than the separation of powers principle.  See O'Donoghue v. United States, 289 U.S. 516, 530, 53 S.Ct. 740, 743, 77 L.Ed. 1356 (1933) (describing separation of powers as \"basic and vital\" to our scheme of government).  This principle has many incarnations.  In one such configuration, it insulates the judiciary from unwarranted legislative intrusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts' historic independence has its roots in the Constitution, which explicitly provides that \"[t]he judicial Power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.\"   U.S. Const. art.  III, &#167; 1. This delegation of power serves \"to safeguard litigants' right to have claims decided before judges who are free from potential domination by other branches of government.\"  Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 848, 106 S.Ct. 3245, 3255, 92 L.Ed.2d 675 (1986) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The due administration of justice demands that this separation remain inviolate.  The plaintiffs lament that the PLRA infringes upon the courts' guaranteed separateness in two distinct ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Reopening Final Judgments.   The separation of powers principle forbids Congress from reopening the final judgments of Article III courts.  See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 240, 115 S.Ct. 1447, 1463, 131 L.Ed.2d 328 (1995).  After all, if the judiciary's power to render definitive judgments were subject to congressional control, then the judiciary would become, within its own sphere, subordinate to the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moving from the general to the particular, the plaintiffs maintain that the PLRA offends this principle by requiring a district court to rescind relief that the court already has seen fit to award.  In mounting this argument, the plaintiffs rely heavily on the Justices' observation, made in an earlier round of this litigation, that \"a consent decree is a final judgment that may be reopened only to the extent that equity requires.\"  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 764.   From this thread, the plaintiffs weave a syllogism:  Congress cannot order the reopening of final judgments without offending the separation of powers principle, a consent decree is a final judgment, and therefore Congress cannot mandate the reopening of consent decrees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning frays because consent decrees of the type at issue here are not \"final judgments\" for the purpose of a separation of powers analysis.  In a recent articulation of the rule that the legislature cannot interfere with final judgments of Article III courts, the Supreme Court carefully carved out an exception and endorsed a line of cases sanctioning legislation \"that altered the prospective effect of injunctions entered by Article III courts.\"  Plaut, 514 U.S. at 232, 115 S.Ct. at 1459.   This exception did not spring full-blown from Justice Scalia's brow.  To the contrary, its roots burrow deep into our constitutional soil.  An early exemplar is Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., 59 U.S.  (18 How.) 421, 15 L.Ed. 435 (1855).  That hoary case established that, although a judgment at law is impervious to legislative assault, a forward-looking judgment in equity can succumb to legislative action if the legislature alters the underlying rule of law.  See id. 59 U.S.  (18 How.) at 431-32.   More recent examples also exist.  See, e.g., Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 273, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 1501, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994);  System Fed'n No. 91 v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 651-52, 81 S.Ct. 368, 373-74, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lower courts sometimes are required to follow precedent for precedent's sake, no matter how much the yoke chafes.  Here, however, our burden is light, for the Wheeling Bridge exception is not only mandated by precedent but also makes logical sense.  The legitimacy of prospective equitable relief rests upon the presumed persistence of the conditions that originally justified the relief.  If forward-looking judgments in equity were inviolate, then one of two scenarios would develop:  either the legislature would be stripped of the ability to change substantive law once an injunction had been issued pursuant to that law, or an issued injunction would continue to have force after the law that originally gave the injunction legitimacy had been found wanting (and, hence, altered).  The first of these possible results would work an undue judicial interference with the legislative process, while the second would create an intolerable tangle in which some laws applied to some persons and not to others.  Since the separation of powers principle is a two-way street, courts must be careful not to embrace a legal regime that promotes such awkward scenarios.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, consent decrees are final judgments, but they are final judgments subject to revision \"to the extent that equity requires.\"  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 764.  Plaut and Wheeling Bridge, read together, teach that equity requires, and the separation of powers principle permits, legislatures to direct that courts respond to changes in substantive law by revisiting forward-looking injunctions.  See Plyler v. Moore, 100 F.3d 365, 371 (4th Cir.1996).  The Court stated the point with great clarity earlier in this litigation:  \"A consent decree must of course be modified if, as it later turns out, one or more of the obligations [it imposes] has become impermissible under federal law.\"  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388, 112 S.Ct. at 762.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs try to turn these verities to their advantage by asserting that the underlying law here--the Eighth Amendment--has not changed.  This is resupinate reasoning.  The relevant underlying law in this case is not the Eighth Amendment, as there has been no finding of an ongoing constitutional violation.  Rather, the relevant underlying law relates to the district court's authority to issue and maintain prospective relief absent a violation of a federal right, and the PLRA has truncated that authority.  See Benjamin v. Jacobson, 124 F.3d 162, 172 (2d Cir.1997).  The termination of a consent decree in response to the PLRA, therefore, merely effectuates Congress's decision to divest district courts of the ability to construct or perpetuate prospective relief when no violation of a federal right exists.  Given this shift in the relevant underlying law, the termination of prospective relief pursuant to the PLRA does not amount to a legislative reopening of a final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Rules of Decision.   The plaintiffs next contend that the PLRA's termination provision violates a different aspect of the separation of powers principle, articulated in United States v. Klein, 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) 128, 20 L.Ed. 519 (1871).  Klein had its genesis in the aftermath of the Civil War, when Congress passed a statute that permitted noncombatant Confederate landowners to recover confiscated goods upon proof of their loyalty to the Union.  Klein, the administrator of the estate of Wilson, a Confederate sympathizer, attempted to recover Wilson's goods pursuant to this statute.  Mindful that the Supreme Court had previously declared that a presidential pardon was conclusive proof of loyalty, see United States v. Padelford, 76 U.S.  (9 Wall.) 531, 19 L.Ed. 788 (1869), Klein tendered evidence that Wilson had received such a pardon.  While the case was pending, Congress passed a statute which declared that a presidential pardon was proof of disloyalty and directed the dismissal of any pending recovery action brought on behalf of a pardon recipient.  See Klein, 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) at 131-34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court invalidated the new statute on separation of powers grounds.  It ruled that if the law were allowed to stand, then the trial court would have \"jurisdiction of the cause to a given point;  but when it ascertains that a certain state of things exists, its jurisdiction is to cease and it is required to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction.\"  Id., 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) at 146.   Such a requirement \"is not an exercise of the acknowledged power of Congress to make exceptions and prescribe regulations to the appellate power\" and thus \"passe[s] the limit which separates the legislative from the judicial power.\"  Id., 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) at 146-47.   The Klein Court distinguished Wheeling Bridge as a situation in which \"the court was left to apply its ordinary rules to the new circumstances created by the act [whereas in Klein ] no new circumstances have been created by legislation.  But the court is forbidden to give the effect to evidence which, in its own judgment, such evidence should have, and is directed to give it an effect precisely contrary.\"  Id., 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) at 147.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that the case at hand resembles Klein more than Wheeling Bridge because the law underlying the consent decree--the Eighth Amendment--remains constant, yet the PLRA imposes a rule of decision by instructing courts to terminate prospective relief.  This argument misapprehends the situation.  As noted above, the relevant underlying law for present purposes is not the Eighth Amendment, but the power of federal courts to grant prospective relief absent a violation of a federal right.  Thus, the PLRA does not run afoul of Klein because it does not tamper with courts' decisional rules--that is, courts remain free to interpret and apply the law to the facts as they discern them.  Because the PLRA leaves the courts' adjudicatory processes intact, it does not transgress the Klein doctrine.  See Gavin v. Branstad, 122 F.3d 1081, 1088, 1089 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>B. Due Process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs base their next two objections on the Due Process Clause.  The first rests on the postulate that the consent decree is a final judgment, the existence of which vests property rights in the parties that cannot be alienated by Congress.  By purporting to terminate consent decrees, this thesis runs, the PLRA not only reopens final judgments but also robs the judgments' beneficiaries of rights secured to them thereunder.  The plaintiffs' second objection posits that the 1979 consent decree constitutes a contract and that due process limits the extent to which the federal government can enact legislation that has a deleterious effect on preexisting contracts.  Both objections lack force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Vested Rights.   The plaintiffs' first objection fails because, at least in the absence of exceptional circumstances well beyond any that are present here, frankly modifiable decrees cannot create vested rights.  See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 273, 114 S.Ct. at 1501 (noting that \"relief by injunction operates in futuro, and that [a party] ha[s] no vested right in the decree entered by the trial court\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  As we have already pointed out, consent decrees are not merely final judgments, but a special species of that genre--final judgments that can be \"reopened ... to the extent that equity requires.\"  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 764.   In the instant case, equity requires termination of the 1979 decree because Congress has withdrawn the power that animated the decree.  See 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3626(a)(1)(A), (b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the plaintiffs argue that this reasoning is circular.  But, given the tenuous nature of consent decrees, that argument will not wash.  There is a basic difference between a money judgment and a consent decree:  the former is fixed, whereas the latter is necessarily impermanent.  Thus, insofar as a consent decree has prospective effect, it must on motion be adjusted to accommodate material changes of fact or law germane to its issuance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 393, 112 S.Ct. at 764-65.   Here, the PLRA has altered the standard by which courts can continue forward-looking relief, and this profound change in the relevant underlying law entitles the defendants to termination of the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Contract Rights.   The plaintiffs' second due process objection is equally unavailing.  Even if we make two broad assumptions that are integral to their position--namely, that the consent decree is a contract and that the PLRA impairs that contract--the objection founders.  The Supreme Court delineated the standard of review for federal legislation that impairs contractual relations in National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., 470 U.S. 451, 105 S.Ct. 1441, 84 L.Ed.2d 432 (1985).  If a substantial impairment of a contract right is found or assumed, \"the reviewing court next determines whether the impairment is of constitutional dimension.\"  Id. at 472, 105 S.Ct. at 1455.   It engages in this analysis by examining the statute and identifying the parties to the contract.  See id.  \"When the contract is a private one, and when the impairing statute is a federal one, this next inquiry is especially limited, and the judicial scrutiny quite minimal.  The party asserting a Fifth Amendment due process violation must overcome a presumption of constitutionality and establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.\"  Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the federal government is not a party to the \"contract\" in issue here (the consent decree), the plaintiffs seek to upgrade the level of scrutiny.  Their gambit depends upon the Court's opinion in Garcia v. San Antonio Metro.  Transit Auth., 469 U.S. 528, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985), which, they say, stands for the proposition that the states have sufficient representation in the federal government to influence its actions, and that, by extension, the federal sovereign's actions should be attributed to the states.  From this coign of vantage, they argue that, since federal laws are enacted by a government organized for the benefit of the several states, a federal act that impairs a contract to which a state is a party should receive the same degree of scrutiny as a federal act that impairs a contract to which the United States is a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ratiocination is predicated on a strained reading of Garcia.   The Garcia Court held that state participation in the federal government provides a sufficient safeguard to prevent federal overreaching vis-a-vis the states.  See id. at 552, 105 S.Ct. at 1018.   There is, however, no basis in Garcia or elsewhere to suggest that federal legislation which benefits state governments is tantamount to self-dealing and thus subject to heightened scrutiny.  We therefore summarily reject the plaintiffs' reading of Garcia and the attendant claim that the federal government somehow became a constructive party to the 1979 consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This gets the grease from the goose.  Because the federal sovereign is not a party to the consent decree, either in fact or by indirection, we need only subject the PLRA to a rational basis review.  See National Passenger, 470 U.S. at 471-72, 105 S.Ct. at 1454-55;  see also United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 22, 97 S.Ct. 1505, 1518, 52 L.Ed.2d 92 (1977) (holding that \"[l]egislation adjusting the rights and responsibilities of contracting parties must be [based] upon reasonable conditions and of a character appropriate to the public purpose justifying its adoption\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Stressing that the PLRA abrogates existing responsibilities, the plaintiffs make the obligatory argument that the law is arbitrary and irrational.  But these animadversions vastly overstate the case.  The PLRA only affects agreements that have at all times remained subject to modification should circumstances change.  And, moreover, by facilitating termination, the PLRA's termination provision forges a practical, commonsense linkage between a changed circumstance--the district courts' newfound inability to grant or enforce prospective relief absent a violation of a federal right--and an existing consent decree.  Consequently, section 3626(b)(2) survives rational basis scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>C. Equal Protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also advance a pair of arguments based on the Equal Protection Clause.  First, they note that pretrial detainees, by definition, have not yet been convicted of the crime(s) with which they have been charged.  Thus, they enjoy both the presumption of innocence, see In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), and the right not to be punished prematurely, see Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).  Building on this foundation, the plaintiffs assert that the PLRA is subject to strict scrutiny (which it fails) because it abridges these fundamental rights.  In the alternative, they claim that the Act violates core principles of equal protection because it has no rational relationship to legitimate state interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Fundamental Rights.   Although the PLRA circumscribes a district court's ability to provide prospective relief to pretrial detainees (as well as all other prisoners) absent a violation of a federal right, we conclude that this feature of the Act does not abridge the pretrial detainees' right to be free from punishment.  Prison conditions either violate fundamental rights (in which event they also violate federally secured rights) or they do not violate fundamental rights (in which event they do not violate federally secured rights).  In the former case, the PLRA permits relief to redeem the fundamental right.  In the latter case, the PLRA does not permit relief, but as no violation exists, the PLRA's denial of relief does not imperil pretrial detainees' fundamental rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also possible to argue that the PLRA implicates the fundamental right of access to the courts, see Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 578, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 2985-86, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), and that, by withdrawing the power to grant inmates prospective relief in a manner available to other classes of people, the PLRA trammels inmates' rights of access.  This line of reasoning does not withstand close examination.  Under the PLRA, the courthouse doors remain open and the withdrawal of prospective relief--above and beyond what is necessary to correct the violation of federally protected rights--does not diminish the right of access.  In a nutshell, while there is a constitutional right to court access, there is no complementary constitutional right to receive or be eligible for a particular form of relief.  See Crowder v. Sinyard, 884 F.2d 804, 814 (5th Cir.1989), abrogated on other grounds by Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Rational Basis.   The plaintiffs' final constitutional challenge suggests that the PLRA violates the Equal Protection Clause because it \"singl[es] out a certain class of citizens for disfavored legal status or general hardship[ ].\"  Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 1628, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996).  This suggestion is ill-conceived.  A statute that neither abridges a fundamental right nor operates against a suspect class receives rational basis review when it is challenged under the Equal Protection Clause.  See Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 318-19, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 2641-42, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993).  The PLRA is such a statute:  as we already have explained, it does not impair a fundamental right, and the plaintiffs do not assert that pretrial detainees are a suspect class.  Thus, rational basis review applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A statute survives rationality review if it \"bear[s] a rational relationship to an independent and legitimate legislative end.\"  Romer, at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1627.   The PLRA's legislative history indicates that the drafters intended the Act to \"address the alarming explosion in the number of frivolous lawsuits filed by State and Federal prisoners,\" to \"mak[e] it much more difficult for Federal judges to issue orders directing the release of convicted criminals from prison custody,\" 141 Cong.  Rec. 14,413 (1995) (statement of Sen.  Dole), and to wrest control of state penitentiaries from federal courts so that states \"will be able to run prisons as they see fit unless there is a constitutional violation,\" id. at 14,419 (statement of Sen.  Abraham).  These purposes are clearly legitimate.  They involve the allocation of public resources, the maintenance of public safety, and the desire to institutionalize a state-centric conception of our federal system.  The means chosen to effect these ends are stern, but they certainly bear a reasonable relationship to the announced legislative goals.  From this perspective, the PLRA easily passes rational basis review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs try to undermine this appraisal by asserting that an anti-inmate animus drove Congress's approval of the PLRA.  They claim that such an invidiously discriminatory intent violates the Court's admonition that a legislature cannot construct legislation \"for the purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the law.\"  Romer, at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1628;  see also United States Dep't of Agric. v. Moreno, 413 U.S. 528, 534, 93 S.Ct. 2821, 2826, 37 L.Ed.2d 782 (1973) (\"[I]f the constitutional conception of 'equal protection of the laws' means anything, it must at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot constitute a legitimate governmental interest.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not grapple with the intriguing question of whether the Romer Court meant to add a new \"animus test\" to the armamentarium of rationality review.  The short, entirely dispositive answer to the plaintiffs' supplication is that the evidence in the record simply does not show that the legislature inappropriately sought to disadvantage the plaintiff class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only \"proof\" that the plaintiffs offer consists of political rhetoric, such as the statement on the Senate floor that \"criminals, while they must be accorded their constitutional rights, deserve to be punished.  Obviously, they should not be tortured or treated cruelly.  At the same time, they also should not have all the rights and privileges the rest of us enjoy.  Rather, their lives should, on the whole, be describable by the old concept known as 'hard time.' \"   141 Cong.  Rec. 14,419 (1995) (statement of Sen.  Abraham).  Passing the obvious point that such rhetoric must be taken with a grain of salt--elected officials, after all, have been known to strike poses for public consumption--the most that fairly can be said is that oratory of this sort may evince a philosophical shift;  it hardly betokens an impermissible animus.  In all events, the state is well within its right to punish persons convicted of crimes, and a retributive desire to effect such punishment consequently does not offend any supposed \"animus test.\"   Furthermore, the plaintiffs are not criminals, but pretrial detainees;  they have not been found guilty of any crimes.  Thus, even if the political rhetoric spotlighted by the plaintiffs qualified as animus directed at criminals, it would not constitute cognizable animus for present purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, an objective reading of the legislative history demonstrates that the plaintiffs' inability to obtain prospective relief does not spring from Congress's wish to do them harm, but from its desire to minimize the occasion for federal courts to administer state prisons.  Consequently, the PLRA does not succumb to any theoretical \"animus test\" contained within the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. APPLYING THE PLRA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have a fallback position.  They contend that, even if the PLRA is constitutional, the 1979 consent decree should remain intact because (1) the district court previously made findings sufficient to save the decree by operation of the Act, see 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3626(b)(2), or (2) if the findings to date are inadequate, the district court should have conducted an inquiry into whether a violation of a federal right exists currently (or probably will come into existence if the strictures of the consent decree are lifted) before implementing the PLRA's termination provision.  We reject both contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Answering the question of whether prison conditions constitute an ongoing violation of a federal right under the PLRA necessitates both a definition of the right at stake and an assessment of a specific compendium of prison conditions.  Accordingly, such a question comprises a mixed question of fact and law, the answer to which we review \"along a degree-of-deference continuum, ranging from plenary review for law-dominated questions to clear-error review for fact-dominated questions.\"  Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co., 63 F.3d 1129, 1132 (1st Cir.1995).  Here, the question is more factual than legal:  inasmuch as the double bunking of pretrial detainees does not in and of itself violate the Constitution, see Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 541, 99 S.Ct. at 1875, the district court's conclusion that the double bunking of which the plaintiffs continue to complain is not in violation of a federal right must be challenged, if at all, principally on the facts.  Thus, the standard of review is highly deferential.  See Huguley v. General Motors Corp., 999 F.2d 142, 146 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully reviewed the record and culled out the sparse factual findings that the court made in the relevant time frame.  No useful purpose would be served by examining these findings in minute detail.  Judge Keeton concluded that they did not satisfy the requirements of section 3626(a) or (b).  See D. Ct. Op., 952 F.Supp. at 880.   A trial court generally is thought to be the best interpreter of its own prior rulings and findings, see, e.g., Martha's Vineyard Scuba Headquarters, Inc. v. Unidentified, Wrecked &amp; Abandoned Steam Vessel, 833 F.2d 1059, 1066-67 (1st Cir.1987);  Lefkowitz v. Fair, 816 F.2d 17, 22 (1st Cir.1987), and this case is no exception.  At any rate, we agree with Judge Keeton's conclusion.  It is simply implausible to suggest, on this record, that the district court's assessment of the existing factual findings is clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' follow-on argument gains them no ground.  As to the conditions that presently exist, we defer to the district court's intimate familiarity with this protracted litigation and to its informed evaluation of current prison conditions.  See D. Ct. Op., 952 F.Supp. at 880 (observing that \"no evidence is before the court to support findings that defendants are not in compliance with the terms of the modified Consent Decree\").  Deference is especially appropriate here since, under the terms of an order that it entered on June 14, 1994, the district court for some time had been receiving and evaluating periodic reports from the Sheriff concerning incidents of assaultive behavior, rape, disease, and the like at the Nashua Street jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to what the future may bring, we cannot criticize Judge Keeton's reluctance to play the oracle.  Presented with the opportunity to make further findings before deciding the defendants' motions, the judge declined.  He noted several cogent reasons why it made sense to leave the question of whether a violation of a federal right might follow the termination of prospective relief under the consent decree to another day.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no error.  This is neither the time nor the place to press an inherently speculative claim of harm to come.  The PLRA imposes no obligation on the trial court to make a predictive inquiry into future conditions before terminating an existing consent decree, and we are not aware of any other basis for burdening the court with such a requirement.  Quite often, \"[p]resent fears are less than horrible imaginings.\"   William Shakespeare, Macbeth, act 1, sc. 3 (1605).  If, in this instance, the plaintiffs' trepidation proves justified, they remain free to initiate a new round of proceedings designed to show that post-termination prison conditions actually do violate their federally protected rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. VACATING THE CONSENT DECREE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having construed the PLRA and established that its termination-of-prospective-relief provision passes constitutional muster, that the conditions for exemption have not been met, and that the Act's mandate requires the district court to terminate the consent decree, we now mull whether that mandate means that an order must be entered not only terminating the consent decree but actually vacating it.  The district court thought not.  See D. Ct. Op., 952 F.Supp. at 883-84.   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' opposition is easily dispatched.  Nothing in the PLRA or its legislative history speaks of vacating consent decrees.  Congress chose to use the verb \"terminate\" and to eschew the verb \"vacate.\"   The distinction between these two words is clear:  \"terminate\" means \"to put an end to\" or \"to end,\" Black's Law Dictionary at 1471, whereas \"vacate\" means \"to annul\" or \"to render ... void,\" id. at 1548.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present context, this distinction may well possess practical significance.  Cf. Benjamin, 124 F.3d at 177-178 (explaining that court's view of the distinction between terminating prospective relief and vacating a consent decree).  While terminating a consent decree strips it of future potency, the decree's past puissance is preserved and certain of its collateral effects may endure.  Vacating a consent decree, however, wipes the slate clean, not only rendering the decree sterile for future purposes, but also eviscerating any collateral effects and, indeed, casting a shadow on past actions taken under the decree's imprimatur.  As nothing in the PLRA even hints that consent decrees must be vacated when prospective relief is terminated, we uphold the district court's ruling that the PLRA does not require vacation of the 1979 decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  To the extent that the parties advance other arguments, we reject them out of hand.  None requires elaboration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm so much of the judgment below that (a) found the PLRA to be constitutional, (b) terminated all prospective relief under the 1979 consent decree, and (c) refused to vacate that decree.  We direct, however, that the judgment be revised to terminate the consent decree itself and we remand for the entry of a modified judgment (together with such further proceedings, if any, as the district court may deem necessary in light of this opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed as modified and remanded.  All parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Notwithstanding the several emendations that have been made to the original consent decree, we refer to the decree, as modified from time to time, as the \"1979 consent decree.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because Congress intended the PLRA to effect the termination of consent decrees, we need not elaborate upon what consequences might follow from the termination of prospective relief alone.  We note, however, that the Second Circuit has invested substantial time in exploring the potential ramifications of terminating prospective relief while leaving a consent decree otherwise intact.  See Benjamin v. Jacobson, 124 F.3d 162, 177-178 (2d Cir.1997).  Inasmuch as our interpretation of the PLRA obviates the need for any such exercise, we take no view of the Benjamin court's conclusions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This precept could not come as a surprise to the plaintiffs.  In the last modification of the consent decree, under date of June 14, 1994, the district court advised the parties that it would entertain future motions to modify \"upon a showing of good cause ... or upon a showing of material change in circumstances.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Commissioner moved below for vacation of the 1979 consent decree under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) and now appeals the denial of that motion.  We need not address that aspect of the matter.  At oral argument in this court, the Commissioner agreed that if the consent decree were to be terminated, the Rule 60(b) issue could be set to one side.  We take the Commissioner at his word and therefore express no opinion as to the merits of the Rule 60(b) claim</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In its wake, the Sheriff of Suffolk County and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Correction (collectively, the defendants) cast their gaze toward a consent decree that has governed important aspects of the county's handling of pretrial detainees since 1979.  Spying an opportunity to sever the shackles of judicial oversight, the defendants invoked the new law and asked the supervising tribunal, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, to vacate the decree or, in the alternative, to terminate all prospective relief under it.  The plaintiffs questioned the Act's constitutionality and raised a host of other objections to the defendants' motions.  The district court repulsed the constitutional attack but construed the PLRA to require only the termination of prospective relief, not the vacatur of the consent decree itself.  See Inmates of Suffolk County Jail v. Sheriff of Suffolk County, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></span> (D.Mass.1997) (D.Ct.Op.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After careful consideration of the meaning of the PLRA, we vouchsafe the Act's constitutionality against the challenges asserted here and construe it to entitle correctional officials to the termination of existing consent decrees in civil actions involving prison conditions (except in the presence of statutorily prescribed conditions that forestall such termination).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.

After extensive skirmishing, not relevant here, the parties reached a rapprochement, subsequently approved by the district court and embodied in the 1979 consent decree, in which they ratified an architectural plan for a new facility featuring single-occupancy cells.  The agreement contemplated the phasing-out of the existing Charles Street jail once the new structure was in place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Scottish poet warned, \"the best laid schemes o' mice and men gang aft a-gley,\" Robert Burns, To a Mouse (1785), and in this case time proved a formidable opponent.  Growth in prison population and delays in construction both exceeded expectations.  The new facility (the Nashua Street jail) was not completed until mid-1990 and was hard-pressed from the start to cope with the Sheriff's escalating needs.  In response to these volatile conditions, the consent decree was modified by court order in 1985, 1990, and 1994.  The last of these changes permitted limited double bunking at the Nashua Street facility (the Sheriff having closed the Charles Street facility prior thereto).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1996 the Sheriff initiated the current engagement.  He grasped the weapon that Congress had forged and moved to terminate all prospective relief pursuant to the PLRA.  Not to be outdone, the Commissioner moved to vacate the consent decree outright, thus formalizing a suggestion that the Sheriff had omitted from his motion but had included in the memorandum supporting the motion.  When the plaintiffs indicated that they would challenge the Act's constitutionality as part of their opposition, the federal government intervened.  After sorting out the components of the parties' extensive asseverational array, Judge Keeton gave the pertinent provisions of the PLRA a narrowing construction and on that basis upheld their constitutionality.  He thereupon granted the Sheriff's motion to the extent that the consent decree would \"no longer be enforced by an order of specific performance,\" but declined either to vacate the decree or to \"terminate the obligations stated [therein]\" because those obligations represented \"consensual undertakings of the defendants with court approval.\"  Id. at 883.   All parties appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to cut a passable swath through this legal thicket, we start by construing the termination provision of the PLRA.  We then test its constitutionality and, finding no merit in the plaintiffs' constitutional challenges, apply the Act and evaluate the extent of the remediation to which the defendants are entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE PLRA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In parsing the PLRA, we afford de novo review.  See United States v.

Such an exercise in statutory interpretation always begins with the language of the statute itself.  See Stowell v. Ives, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"591389\"><a href=\"/opinion/591389/christine-stowell-etc-v-h-rollin-ives-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 69 (1st Cir.1992).  At this stage, an inquisitive court should assume that the words of the statute, if not specially defined, comport with their ordinary meaning, and that the words, so read, accurately express the legislature's intent.  See FMC Corp. v. Holliday, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112508\"><a href=\"/opinion/112508/fmc-corp-v-holliday/\"><span class=\"volume\">498</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span>, 57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112508\"><a href=\"/opinion/112508/fmc-corp-v-holliday/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></a></span> (1990).  In keeping with this principle, the court should \"resort to legislative history and other aids of statutory construction only when the literal words of the statute create ambiguity or lead to an unreasonable result.\"  United States v. Charles George Trucking Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"491460\"><a href=\"/opinion/491460/united-states-v-charles-george-trucking-co-charles-george-sr-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">823</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span>, 688 (1st Cir.1987) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PLRA is not a paragon of clarity.  In regard to existing federal court orders, it declares that \"in any civil action with respect to prison conditions, a defendant or intervenor shall be entitled to the immediate termination of any prospective relief if the relief was approved or granted in the absence of a finding by the court that the relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\"  18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3626(b)(2).  Such prospective relief shall not terminate, however, \"if the court makes written findings based on the record that prospective relief remains necessary to correct a current or ongoing violation of the Federal right, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and that the prospective relief is narrowly drawn and the least intrusive means to correct the violation.\"  Id. &#167; 3626(b)(3).  With regard to relief not yet obtained, the Act contains similar proscriptions.  It forbids courts from granting or approving prospective relief \"unless the court finds that such relief is narrowly drawn, extends no further than necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right, and is the least intrusive means necessary to correct the violation of the Federal right.\"  Id. &#167; 3626(a)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These iterations are clear enough, but uncertainty arises when we examine the Act's definitional instructions.  One such passage defines \"prospective relief\" to include \"all relief other than compensatory monetary damages,\" and then defines \"relief\" to \"mean[ ] all relief in any form that may be granted or approved by the court ... includ[ing] consent decrees.\"  Id. &#167; 3626(g)(7), (9).  \"Consent decree,\" in turn, means \"any relief entered by the court that is based in whole or in part upon the consent or acquiescence of the parties but does not include private settlements.\"  Id. &#167; 3626(b)(1).  In a vacuum, the interaction of the Act's mechanics and these definitions is manageable:  terminating \"prospective relief\" as prescribed by section 3626(b)(2) would terminate \"all relief,\" see section 3626(g)(7), which under section 3626(g)(9) \"includes consent decrees.\"   Read literally, therefore, once defendants or intervenors show their entitlement to terminate prospective relief, the Act seemingly requires termination of the consent decree itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court astutely observed, this result is counterintuitive in that it contradicts the usual understanding of both \"relief\" and \"consent decree.\"   See D. Ct. Op., 952 F.Supp. at 878.   The customary definition of \"consent decree\" likens such decrees to judgments, see Black's Law Dictionary 410 (6th ed.1990) (defining \"consent decree\" as \"[a] judgment entered by consent of the parties whereby the defendant agrees to stop alleged illegal activity without admitting guilt or wrongdoing\"), and in ordinary usage a judgment is \"[a] final decision of the court resolving the dispute and determining the rights and obligations of the parties,\" id. at 841-42.  \"Relief,\" on the other hand, typically is equated with \"remedy,\" id. at 1292, which is \"the means by which a right is enforced or the violation of a right is prevented, redressed, or compensated,\" id. at 1294.   Inasmuch as a remedy effectuates the adjudication expressed in a judgment, one ordinarily would assume that \"relief,\" by extension, effectuates the legal decision, arrived at by consent, in a \"consent decree.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress conflated the two terms when it described consent decrees as a form of relief rather than as a judgment that engenders relief.  The PLRA's equation of \"consent decree\" and \"relief\" contradicts conventional understandings and creates a situation in which a strict, language-based construction of the PLRA requires that commonplace legal terms be used in curious ways.  This circumstance fosters uncertainty, for a court cannot really tell, without further inquiry, whether the linguistic anomaly is accidental or purposeful (and, thus, whether Congress meant to uproot consent decrees themselves or merely to vitiate the relief attendant to them, when it directed federal courts to facilitate \"the immediate termination of any prospective relief\" at the behest of prison litigation defendants and intervenors).  This uncertainty impels us to consult extrinsic sources in search of guidance as to Congress's intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the PLRA's legislative history persuades us to embrace the unusual.  Congress passed the PLRA in an effort, in part, to oust the federal judiciary from day-to-day prison management.  See 141 Cong.  Rec. 14,419 (1995) (statement of Sen.  Abraham) (\"[N]o longer will prison administration be turned over to Federal judges for the indefinite future for the slightest reason.\");  id. at 14,418 (statement of Sen.  Hatch) (\"I believe that the courts have gone too far in micromanaging our Nation's prisons.\").  This evidence of ambient intent inclines us to interpret the statute literally (i.e., as directing courts to terminate consent decrees outright), for it strongly suggests that the PLRA's sponsors wanted to truncate the federal judiciary's involvement in prison administration.  The House Conference Report provides even more powerful direction on this score.  The Report describes the \"explanation of the effect of the action agreed upon by the [legislation's] managers\" and states that, by virtue of the PLRA, \"[p]rior consent decrees are made terminable upon the motion of either party, and can be continued only if the court finds that the imposed relief is necessary to correct the violation of the federal right.\"   H.R. Conf.  Rep. No. 104-378 at 166 (1995).  This plain language leaves little room for doubt that Congress intended the PLRA as a last rite for those consent decrees that are incapable of surviving the rigors of section 3626(b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, we recognize that the plain meaning rule, while a bedrock principle of statutory construction, may yield if giving effect to literal meaning would produce a bizarre result.  See Sullivan v. CIA, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"606324\"><a href=\"/opinion/606324/sherry-ann-sullivan-v-central-intelligence-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span>, 1252 (1st Cir.1993);  Charles George Trucking, 823 F.2d at 688.   But this exception is sparingly employed, and the circumstances of this case give it no purchase.  The result that Congress's plain language portends here involves a somewhat unusual use of terms, but it is not unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We will not paint the lily.  Given the congruence between the text of the statute and the legislature's easily discerned intent, we conclude that Congress meant precisely what it said--however deviant from ordinary usage that may be--when it wrote the PLRA and specially defined its operative terms.  We are therefore duty bound to interpret the PLRA as mandating the termination of extant consent decrees altogether unless the district court makes the specific findings that are necessary to keep a particular decree alive.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE PLRA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having construed the PLRA, we next must essay a de novo determination of whether it passes constitutional muster.  The plaintiffs say that the Act's termination provision violates the Constitution three times over by transgressing (1) the separation of powers principle, (2) the Due Process Clause, and (3) the Equal Protection Clause.

Reopening Final Judgments.   The separation of powers principle forbids Congress from reopening the final judgments of Article III courts.  See Plaut v.

After all, if the judiciary's power to render definitive judgments were subject to congressional control, then the judiciary would become, within its own sphere, subordinate to the legislature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moving from the general to the particular, the plaintiffs maintain that the PLRA offends this principle by requiring a district court to rescind relief that the court already has seen fit to award.  In mounting this argument, the plaintiffs rely heavily on the Justices' observation, made in an earlier round of this litigation, that \"a consent decree is a final judgment that may be reopened only to the extent that equity requires.\"  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 764.   From this thread, the plaintiffs weave a syllogism:  Congress cannot order the reopening of final judgments without offending the separation of powers principle, a consent decree is a final judgment, and therefore Congress cannot mandate the reopening of consent decrees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This reasoning frays because consent decrees of the type at issue here are not \"final judgments\" for the purpose of a separation of powers analysis.  In a recent articulation of the rule that the legislature cannot interfere with final judgments of Article III courts, the Supreme Court carefully carved out an exception and endorsed a line of cases sanctioning legislation \"that altered the prospective effect of injunctions entered by Article III courts.\"  Plaut, 514 U.S. at 232, 115 S.Ct. at 1459.   This exception did not spring full-blown from Justice Scalia's brow.  To the contrary, its roots burrow deep into our constitutional soil.  An early exemplar is Pennsylvania v. Wheeling &amp; Belmont Bridge Co., 59 U.S.  (18 How.) 421, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span> (1855).  That hoary case established that, although a judgment at law is impervious to legislative assault, a forward-looking judgment in equity can succumb to legislative action if the legislature alters the underlying rule of law.

Here, however, our burden is light, for the Wheeling Bridge exception is not only mandated by precedent but also makes logical sense.  The legitimacy of prospective equitable relief rests upon the presumed persistence of the conditions that originally justified the relief.  If forward-looking judgments in equity were inviolate, then one of two scenarios would develop:  either the legislature would be stripped of the ability to change substantive law once an injunction had been issued pursuant to that law, or an issued injunction would continue to have force after the law that originally gave the injunction legitimacy had been found wanting (and, hence, altered).  The first of these possible results would work an undue judicial interference with the legislative process, while the second would create an intolerable tangle in which some laws applied to some persons and not to others.  Since the separation of powers principle is a two-way street, courts must be careful not to embrace a legal regime that promotes such awkward scenarios.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To recapitulate, consent decrees are final judgments, but they are final judgments subject to revision \"to the extent that equity requires.\"  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 764.  Plaut and Wheeling Bridge, read together, teach that equity requires, and the separation of powers principle permits, legislatures to direct that courts respond to changes in substantive law by revisiting forward-looking injunctions.  See Plyler v. Moore, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></span>, 371 (4th Cir.1996).  The Court stated the point with great clarity earlier in this litigation:  \"A consent decree must of course be modified if, as it later turns out, one or more of the obligations [it imposes] has become impermissible under federal law.\"  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 388, 112 S.Ct. at 762.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs try to turn these verities to their advantage by asserting that the underlying law here--the Eighth Amendment--has not changed.  This is resupinate reasoning.  The relevant underlying law in this case is not the Eighth Amendment, as there has been no finding of an ongoing constitutional violation.  Rather, the relevant underlying law relates to the district court's authority to issue and maintain prospective relief absent a violation of a federal right, and the PLRA has truncated that authority.  See Benjamin v. Jacobson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745486\"><a href=\"/opinion/745486/james-benjamin-v-michael-jacobson-commissioner-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 172 (2d Cir.1997).  The termination of a consent decree in response to the PLRA, therefore, merely effectuates Congress's decision to divest district courts of the ability to construct or perpetuate prospective relief when no violation of a federal right exists.  Given this shift in the relevant underlying law, the termination of prospective relief pursuant to the PLRA does not amount to a legislative reopening of a final judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Rules of Decision.   The plaintiffs next contend that the PLRA's termination provision violates a different aspect of the separation of powers principle, articulated in United States v. Klein, 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) 128, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></span> (1871).  Klein had its genesis in the aftermath of the Civil War, when Congress passed a statute that permitted noncombatant Confederate landowners to recover confiscated goods upon proof of their loyalty to the Union.  Klein, the administrator of the estate of Wilson, a Confederate sympathizer, attempted to recover Wilson's goods pursuant to this statute.  Mindful that the Supreme Court had previously declared that a presidential pardon was conclusive proof of loyalty, see United States v. Padelford, 76 U.S.  (9 Wall.) 531, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">19</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></span> (1869), Klein tendered evidence that Wilson had received such a pardon.  While the case was pending, Congress passed a statute which declared that a presidential pardon was proof of disloyalty and directed the dismissal of any pending recovery action brought on behalf of a pardon recipient.  See Klein, 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) at 131-34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court invalidated the new statute on separation of powers grounds.  It ruled that if the law were allowed to stand, then the trial court would have \"jurisdiction of the cause to a given point;  but when it ascertains that a certain state of things exists, its jurisdiction is to cease and it is required to dismiss the cause for want of jurisdiction.\"  Id., 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) at 146.   Such a requirement \"is not an exercise of the acknowledged power of Congress to make exceptions and prescribe regulations to the appellate power\" and thus \"passe[s] the limit which separates the legislative from the judicial power.\"  Id., 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) at 146-47.   The Klein Court distinguished Wheeling Bridge as a situation in which \"the court was left to apply its ordinary rules to the new circumstances created by the act [whereas in Klein ] no new circumstances have been created by legislation.  But the court is forbidden to give the effect to evidence which, in its own judgment, such evidence should have, and is directed to give it an effect precisely contrary.\"  Id., 80 U.S.  (13 Wall.) at 147.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that the case at hand resembles Klein more than Wheeling Bridge because the law underlying the consent decree--the Eighth Amendment--remains constant, yet the PLRA imposes a rule of decision by instructing courts to terminate prospective relief.  This argument misapprehends the situation.  As noted above, the relevant underlying law for present purposes is not the Eighth Amendment, but the power of federal courts to grant prospective relief absent a violation of a federal right.  Thus, the PLRA does not run afoul of Klein because it does not tamper with courts' decisional rules--that is, courts remain free to interpret and apply the law to the facts as they discern them.  Because the PLRA leaves the courts' adjudicatory processes intact, it does not transgress the Klein doctrine.  See Gavin v. Branstad, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1081</span></span>, 1088, 1089 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p>B. Due Process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs base their next two objections on the Due Process Clause.  The first rests on the postulate that the consent decree is a final judgment, the existence of which vests property rights in the parties that cannot be alienated by Congress.  By purporting to terminate consent decrees, this thesis runs, the PLRA not only reopens final judgments but also robs the judgments' beneficiaries of rights secured to them thereunder.  The plaintiffs' second objection posits that the 1979 consent decree constitutes a contract and that due process limits the extent to which the federal government can enact legislation that has a deleterious effect on preexisting contracts.  Both objections lack force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Vested Rights.   The plaintiffs' first objection fails because, at least in the absence of exceptional circumstances well beyond any that are present here, frankly modifiable decrees cannot create vested rights.  See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 273, 114 S.Ct. at 1501 (noting that \"relief by injunction operates in futuro, and that [a party] ha[s] no vested right in the decree entered by the trial court\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  As we have already pointed out, consent decrees are not merely final judgments, but a special species of that genre--final judgments that can be \"reopened ... to the extent that equity requires.\"  Rufo, 502 U.S. at 391, 112 S.Ct. at 764.   In the instant case, equity requires termination of the 1979 decree because Congress has withdrawn the power that animated the decree.  See 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3626(a)(1)(A), (b)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the plaintiffs argue that this reasoning is circular.  But, given the tenuous nature of consent decrees, that argument will not wash.  There is a basic difference between a money judgment and a consent decree:  the former is fixed, whereas the latter is necessarily impermanent.  Thus, insofar as a consent decree has prospective effect, it must on motion be adjusted to accommodate material changes of fact or law germane to its issuance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  See Rufo, 502 U.S. at 393, 112 S.Ct. at 764-65.   Here, the PLRA has altered the standard by which courts can continue forward-looking relief, and this profound change in the relevant underlying law entitles the defendants to termination of the decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. Contract Rights.   The plaintiffs' second due process objection is equally unavailing.  Even if we make two broad assumptions that are integral to their position--namely, that the consent decree is a contract and that the PLRA impairs that contract--the objection founders.  The Supreme Court delineated the standard of review for federal legislation that impairs contractual relations in National R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111369\"><a href=\"/opinion/111369/national-r-passenger-corp-v-at-sfr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111369\"><a href=\"/opinion/111369/national-r-passenger-corp-v-at-sfr-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span> (1985).  If a substantial impairment of a contract right is found or assumed, \"the reviewing court next determines whether the impairment is of constitutional dimension.\"  Id. at 472, 105 S.Ct. at 1455.   It engages in this analysis by examining the statute and identifying the parties to the contract.  See id.  \"When the contract is a private one, and when the impairing statute is a federal one, this next inquiry is especially limited, and the judicial scrutiny quite minimal.  The party asserting a Fifth Amendment due process violation must overcome a presumption of constitutionality and establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.\"  Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the federal government is not a party to the \"contract\" in issue here (the consent decree), the plaintiffs seek to upgrade the level of scrutiny.  Their gambit depends upon the Court's opinion in Garcia v. San Antonio Metro.  Transit Auth., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111308\"><a href=\"/opinion/111308/garcia-v-san-antonio-metropolitan-transit-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111308\"><a href=\"/opinion/111308/garcia-v-san-antonio-metropolitan-transit-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span> (1985), which, they say, stands for the proposition that the states have sufficient representation in the federal government to influence its actions, and that, by extension, the federal sovereign's actions should be attributed to the states.  From this coign of vantage, they argue that, since federal laws are enacted by a government organized for the benefit of the several states, a federal act that impairs a contract to which a state is a party should receive the same degree of scrutiny as a federal act that impairs a contract to which the United States is a party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This ratiocination is predicated on a strained reading of Garcia.   The Garcia Court held that state participation in the federal government provides a sufficient safeguard to prevent federal overreaching vis-a-vis the states.  See id. at 552, 105 S.Ct. at 1018.   There is, however, no basis in Garcia or elsewhere to suggest that federal legislation which benefits state governments is tantamount to self-dealing and thus subject to heightened scrutiny.  We therefore summarily reject the plaintiffs' reading of Garcia and the attendant claim that the federal government somehow became a constructive party to the 1979 consent decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This gets the grease from the goose.  Because the federal sovereign is not a party to the consent decree, either in fact or by indirection, we need only subject the PLRA to a rational basis review.  See National Passenger, 470 U.S. at 471-72, 105 S.Ct. at 1454-55;  see also United States Trust Co. v. New Jersey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109647\"><a href=\"/opinion/109647/united-states-trust-co-of-ny-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 22, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109647\"><a href=\"/opinion/109647/united-states-trust-co-of-ny-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But these animadversions vastly overstate the case.  The PLRA only affects agreements that have at all times remained subject to modification should circumstances change.  And, moreover, by facilitating termination, the PLRA's termination provision forges a practical, commonsense linkage between a changed circumstance--the district courts' newfound inability to grant or enforce prospective relief absent a violation of a federal right--and an existing consent decree.  Consequently, section 3626(b)(2) survives rational basis scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>C. Equal Protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs also advance a pair of arguments based on the Equal Protection Clause.  First, they note that pretrial detainees, by definition, have not yet been convicted of the crime(s) with which they have been charged.  Thus, they enjoy both the presumption of innocence, see In re Winship, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108111\"><a href=\"/opinion/108111/in-re-winship/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Wolfish, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110075\"><a href=\"/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/\"><span class=\"volume\">99</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">447</span></a></span> (1979).  Building on this foundation, the plaintiffs assert that the PLRA is subject to strict scrutiny (which it fails) because it abridges these fundamental rights.  In the alternative, they claim that the Act violates core principles of equal protection because it has no rational relationship to legitimate state interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Fundamental Rights.   Although the PLRA circumscribes a district court's ability to provide prospective relief to pretrial detainees (as well as all other prisoners) absent a violation of a federal right, we conclude that this feature of the Act does not abridge the pretrial detainees' right to be free from punishment.  Prison conditions either violate fundamental rights (in which event they also violate federally secured rights) or they do not violate fundamental rights (in which event they do not violate federally secured rights).  In the former case, the PLRA permits relief to redeem the fundamental right.  In the latter case, the PLRA does not permit relief, but as no violation exists, the PLRA's denial of relief does not imperil pretrial detainees' fundamental rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is also possible to argue that the PLRA implicates the fundamental right of access to the courts, see Wolff v. McDonnell, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span>, 578, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span> (1974), and that, by withdrawing the power to grant inmates prospective relief in a manner available to other classes of people, the PLRA trammels inmates' rights of access.  This line of reasoning does not withstand close examination.  Under the PLRA, the courthouse doors remain open and the withdrawal of prospective relief--above and beyond what is necessary to correct the violation of federally protected rights--does not diminish the right of access.  In a nutshell, while there is a constitutional right to court access, there is no complementary constitutional right to receive or be eligible for a particular form of relief.  See Crowder v. Sinyard, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"528813\"><a href=\"/opinion/528813/nancy-crowder-individually-and-as-independent-of-the-estate-of-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">804</span></a></span>, 814 (5th Cir.1989), abrogated on other grounds by Horton v.

Rational Basis.   The plaintiffs' final constitutional challenge suggests that the PLRA violates the Equal Protection Clause because it \"singl[es] out a certain class of citizens for disfavored legal status or general hardship[ ].\"  Romer v. Evans, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118027\"><a href=\"/opinion/118027/romer-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span>, ----, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118027\"><a href=\"/opinion/118027/romer-v-evans/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span> (1996).  This suggestion is ill-conceived.  A statute that neither abridges a fundamental right nor operates against a suspect class receives rational basis review when it is challenged under the Equal Protection Clause.  See Heller v. Doe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 318-19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112896\"><a href=\"/opinion/112896/heller-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span> (1993).  The PLRA is such a statute:  as we already have explained, it does not impair a fundamental right, and the plaintiffs do not assert that pretrial detainees are a suspect class.  Thus, rational basis review applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A statute survives rationality review if it \"bear[s] a rational relationship to an independent and legitimate legislative end.\"  Romer, at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1627.   The PLRA's legislative history indicates that the drafters intended the Act to \"address the alarming explosion in the number of frivolous lawsuits filed by State and Federal prisoners,\" to \"mak[e] it much more difficult for Federal judges to issue orders directing the release of convicted criminals from prison custody,\" 141 Cong.  Rec. 14,413 (1995) (statement of Sen.  Dole), and to wrest control of state penitentiaries from federal courts so that states \"will be able to run prisons as they see fit unless there is a constitutional violation,\" id. at 14,419 (statement of Sen.  Abraham).  These purposes are clearly legitimate.  They involve the allocation of public resources, the maintenance of public safety, and the desire to institutionalize a state-centric conception of our federal system.  The means chosen to effect these ends are stern, but they certainly bear a reasonable relationship to the announced legislative goals.  From this perspective, the PLRA easily passes rational basis review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs try to undermine this appraisal by asserting that an anti-inmate animus drove Congress's approval of the PLRA.  They claim that such an invidiously discriminatory intent violates the Court's admonition that a legislature cannot construct legislation \"for the purpose of disadvantaging the group burdened by the law.\"  Romer, at ----, 116 S.Ct. at 1628;  see also United States Dep't of Agric. v. Moreno, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108856\"><a href=\"/opinion/108856/department-of-agriculture-v-moreno/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span>, 534, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108856\"><a href=\"/opinion/108856/department-of-agriculture-v-moreno/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The short, entirely dispositive answer to the plaintiffs' supplication is that the evidence in the record simply does not show that the legislature inappropriately sought to disadvantage the plaintiff class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only \"proof\" that the plaintiffs offer consists of political rhetoric, such as the statement on the Senate floor that \"criminals, while they must be accorded their constitutional rights, deserve to be punished.  Obviously, they should not be tortured or treated cruelly.  At the same time, they also should not have all the rights and privileges the rest of us enjoy.  Rather, their lives should, on the whole, be describable by the old concept known as 'hard time.' \"   141 Cong.  Rec. 14,419 (1995) (statement of Sen.  Abraham).  Passing the obvious point that such rhetoric must be taken with a grain of salt--elected officials, after all, have been known to strike poses for public consumption--the most that fairly can be said is that oratory of this sort may evince a philosophical shift;  it hardly betokens an impermissible animus.  In all events, the state is well within its right to punish persons convicted of crimes, and a retributive desire to effect such punishment consequently does not offend any supposed \"animus test.\"   Furthermore, the plaintiffs are not criminals, but pretrial detainees;  they have not been found guilty of any crimes.  Thus, even if the political rhetoric spotlighted by the plaintiffs qualified as animus directed at criminals, it would not constitute cognizable animus for present purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, an objective reading of the legislative history demonstrates that the plaintiffs' inability to obtain prospective relief does not spring from Congress's wish to do them harm, but from its desire to minimize the occasion for federal courts to administer state prisons.  Consequently, the PLRA does not succumb to any theoretical \"animus test\" contained within the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. APPLYING THE PLRA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have a fallback position.  They contend that, even if the PLRA is constitutional, the 1979 consent decree should remain intact because (1) the district court previously made findings sufficient to save the decree by operation of the Act, see 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3626(b)(2), or (2) if the findings to date are inadequate, the district court should have conducted an inquiry into whether a violation of a federal right exists currently (or probably will come into existence if the strictures of the consent decree are lifted) before implementing the PLRA's termination provision.  We reject both contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Answering the question of whether prison conditions constitute an ongoing violation of a federal right under the PLRA necessitates both a definition of the right at stake and an assessment of a specific compendium of prison conditions.  Accordingly, such a question comprises a mixed question of fact and law, the answer to which we review \"along a degree-of-deference continuum, ranging from plenary review for law-dominated questions to clear-error review for fact-dominated questions.\"  Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702493\"><a href=\"/opinion/702493/pens-plan-guide-p-23912p-james-johnson-v-watts-regulator-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1129</span></a></span>, 1132 (1st Cir.1995).  Here, the question is more factual than legal:  inasmuch as the double bunking of pretrial detainees does not in and of itself violate the Constitution, see Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. at 541, 99 S.Ct. at 1875, the district court's conclusion that the double bunking of which the plaintiffs continue to complain is not in violation of a federal right must be challenged, if at all, principally on the facts.  Thus, the standard of review is highly deferential.  See Huguley v. General Motors Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611636\"><a href=\"/opinion/611636/62-fair-emplpraccas-bna-594-62-empl-prac-dec-p-42506-dennis-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span>, 146 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have carefully reviewed the record and culled out the sparse factual findings that the court made in the relevant time frame.  No useful purpose would be served by examining these findings in minute detail.  Judge Keeton concluded that they did not satisfy the requirements of section 3626(a) or (b).  See D. Ct. Op., 952 F.Supp. at 880.   A trial court generally is thought to be the best interpreter of its own prior rulings and findings, see, e.g., Martha's Vineyard Scuba Headquarters, Inc. v. Unidentified, Wrecked &amp; Abandoned Steam Vessel, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497956\"><a href=\"/opinion/497956/marthas-vineyard-scuba-headquarters-inc-v-the-unidentified-wrecked-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1059</span></a></span>, 1066-67 (1st Cir.1987);  Lefkowitz v.

At any rate, we agree with Judge Keeton's conclusion.  It is simply implausible to suggest, on this record, that the district court's assessment of the existing factual findings is clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' follow-on argument gains them no ground.  As to the conditions that presently exist, we defer to the district court's intimate familiarity with this protracted litigation and to its informed evaluation of current prison conditions.  See D. Ct. Op., 952 F.Supp. at 880 (observing that \"no evidence is before the court to support findings that defendants are not in compliance with the terms of the modified Consent Decree\").  Deference is especially appropriate here since, under the terms of an order that it entered on June 14, 1994, the district court for some time had been receiving and evaluating periodic reports from the Sheriff concerning incidents of assaultive behavior, rape, disease, and the like at the Nashua Street jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to what the future may bring, we cannot criticize Judge Keeton's reluctance to play the oracle.  Presented with the opportunity to make further findings before deciding the defendants' motions, the judge declined.  He noted several cogent reasons why it made sense to leave the question of whether a violation of a federal right might follow the termination of prospective relief under the consent decree to another day.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no error.  This is neither the time nor the place to press an inherently speculative claim of harm to come.  The PLRA imposes no obligation on the trial court to make a predictive inquiry into future conditions before terminating an existing consent decree, and we are not aware of any other basis for burdening the court with such a requirement.  Quite often, \"[p]resent fears are less than horrible imaginings.\"   William Shakespeare, Macbeth, act 1, sc. 3 (1605).  If, in this instance, the plaintiffs' trepidation proves justified, they remain free to initiate a new round of proceedings designed to show that post-termination prison conditions actually do violate their federally protected rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. VACATING THE CONSENT DECREE</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having construed the PLRA and established that its termination-of-prospective-relief provision passes constitutional muster, that the conditions for exemption have not been met, and that the Act's mandate requires the district court to terminate the consent decree, we now mull whether that mandate means that an order must be entered not only terminating the consent decree but actually vacating it.  The district court thought not.  See D. Ct. Op., 952 F.Supp. at 883-84.   We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants' opposition is easily dispatched.  Nothing in the PLRA or its legislative history speaks of vacating consent decrees.  Congress chose to use the verb \"terminate\" and to eschew the verb \"vacate.\"   The distinction between these two words is clear:  \"terminate\" means \"to put an end to\" or \"to end,\" Black's Law Dictionary at 1471, whereas \"vacate\" means \"to annul\" or \"to render ... void,\" id. at 1548.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present context, this distinction may well possess practical significance.  Cf. Benjamin, 124 F.3d at 177-178 (explaining that court's view of the distinction between terminating prospective relief and vacating a consent decree).  While terminating a consent decree strips it of future potency, the decree's past puissance is preserved and certain of its collateral effects may endure.  Vacating a consent decree, however, wipes the slate clean, not only rendering the decree sterile for future purposes, but also eviscerating any collateral effects and, indeed, casting a shadow on past actions taken under the decree's imprimatur.  As nothing in the PLRA even hints that consent decrees must be vacated when prospective relief is terminated, we uphold the district court's ruling that the PLRA does not require vacation of the 1979 decree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.  To the extent that the parties advance other arguments, we reject them out of hand.  None requires elaboration.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated herein, we affirm so much of the judgment below that (a) found the PLRA to be constitutional, (b) terminated all prospective relief under the 1979 consent decree, and (c) refused to vacate that decree.  We direct, however, that the judgment be revised to terminate the consent decree itself and we remand for the entry of a modified judgment (together with such further proceedings, if any, as the district court may deem necessary in light of this opinion).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed as modified and remanded.  All parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Notwithstanding the several emendations that have been made to the original consent decree, we refer to the decree, as modified from time to time, as the \"1979 consent decree.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Because Congress intended the PLRA to effect the termination of consent decrees, we need not elaborate upon what consequences might follow from the termination of prospective relief alone.  We note, however, that the Second Circuit has invested substantial time in exploring the potential ramifications of terminating prospective relief while leaving a consent decree otherwise intact.  See Benjamin v. Jacobson, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745486\"><a href=\"/opinion/745486/james-benjamin-v-michael-jacobson-commissioner-of-the-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 177-178 (2d Cir.1997).  Inasmuch as our interpretation of the PLRA obviates the need for any such exercise, we take no view of the Benjamin court's conclusions</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> This precept could not come as a surprise to the plaintiffs.  In the last modification of the consent decree, under date of June 14, 1994, the district court advised the parties that it would entertain future motions to modify \"upon a showing of good cause ... or upon a showing of material change in circumstances.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Commissioner moved below for vacation of the 1979 consent decree under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) and now appeals the denial of that motion.  We need not address that aspect of the matter.  At oral argument in this court, the Commissioner agreed that if the consent decree were to be terminated, the Rule 60(b) issue could be set to one side.  We take the Commissioner at his word and therefore express no opinion as to the merits of the Rule 60(b) claim</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
