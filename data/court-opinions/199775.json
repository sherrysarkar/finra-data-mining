José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Kravitch,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                  and Torruella, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     José M. Tous-Rodríguez, for appellants.\n     Heriberto J. Burgos-Pérez, with whom Fiddler, González & Rodríguez\nLLP and Mariano A. Mier-Romeu, were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n\n*   Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\fJanuary 10, 2002\n\n\n\n\n      -2-\n\f          Per Curiam. Plaintiffs-appellants Carmen Caballero-Rivera\n\nand Talí Benet-Soto appeal from the district court's dismissal of their\n\ncase. Specifically, appellants argue that the district court erred in\n\napplying the doctrine of res judicata to preclude their claim.\n\n          A brief examination of the procedural history of this case,\n\nhowever, reveals the accuracy of the district court's ruling. In 1999,\n\nplaintiffs filed suit in district court claiming that defendants had\n\ndefrauded them by submitting false documents to the Superior Court of\n\nPuerto Rico in a previous lawsuit between the parties.1 Shortly after\n\nthe suit was filed, defendants moved for summary judgment.         The\n\ndistrict court granted defendants' motion on the grounds that\n\nplaintiffs failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact by not\n\nsatisfying the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 9(b).2 Plaintiffs did not appeal the district court's\n\nruling.\n\n          Instead, plaintiffs filed this suit in Puerto Rico Superior\n\nCourt. Defendants removed the case to federal court and filed a motion\n\n\n\n\n1 In the interest of brevity, we refrain from discussing the lawsuits\nfiled by plaintiffs against defendants in 1985, 1992, and 1995 over the\nsame issue.\n2 Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) provides: \"In all averments of\nfraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall\nbe stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge, and other\ncondition of mind of a person may be averred generally.\"\n\n                                 -3-\n\fto dismiss. The district court granted the dismissal, ruling that the\n\ndoctrine of res judicata precluded plaintiffs' claim.\n\n          The doctrine of res judicata promotes the goals of fairness\n\nand efficiency by preventing vexatious or repetitive litigation. See\n\nComm'r v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591, 597 (1948). A claim will be precluded\n\nby res judicata if the following elements are demonstrated: \"(1) a\n\nfinal judgment on the merits in an earlier suit, (2) sufficient\n\nidenticality between the causes of action asserted in the earlier and\n\nlater suits, and (3) sufficient identicality between the parties in the\n\ntwo suits.\" González v. Banco Central Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).\n\n          In the instant case, all three factors are so clearly present\n\nthat only a brief discussion of them is necessary. First, the summary\n\njudgment ruling that disposed of plaintiffs' earlier claim constitutes\n\n\"a final judgment on the merits.\" See Dowd v. Soc'y of St. Columbans,\n\n861 F.2d 761, 764 (1st Cir. 1988) (noting that \"[s]ummary judgment\n\nconstitutes a final judgment on the merits for purposes of applying res\n\njudicata\").3 Second, by plaintiffs' own admission, the instant case is\n\n\n3 Without considering the merits of the prior dismissal, we find no\nprocedural error in the district court's decision to grant summary\njudgment on the basis of plaintiffs' inability to satisfy the pleading\nrequirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). See, e.g., Murr\nPlumbing, Inc. v. Scherer Bros. Fin. Servs., 48 F.3d 1066, 1070 (8th\nCir. 1995) (ruling that \"[a] district court may enter summary judgment\ndismissing a complaint alleging fraud if the complaint fails to satisfy\nthe requirements of Rule 9(b)\"); see also Whalen v. Carter, 954 F.2d\n1087, 1098 (5th Cir. 1992) (same). Our position is further buttressed\n\n                                 -4-\n\fidentical to the previous suit. Third, there is no question that the\n\ntwo suits contain the same parties.\n\n          Because we find no error in the district court's application\n\nof res judicata, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\nby the fact that plaintiffs failed to satisfy the pleading requirements\nafter eight years of litigation.\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
