Following  the only\r\n\ntwo  circuits to  have explicitly  addressed this  matter, we\r\n\nhold he may not. \r\n\n          Petitioner-appellant   Arthur    J.   Smullen   was\r\n\nconvicted  following  a  jury  trial  in  the  United  States\r\n\nDistrict  Court for  the District  of Massachusetts  on three\r\n\ncounts  of  making false  statements to  a federal  agency in\r\n\nviolation of  18 U.S.C.   1001.  On May 27, 1993, Smullen was\r\n\nsentenced to  27 months  in prison,  36 months  of supervised\r\n\nrelease,  restitution in  the  amount of  $121,377.78, and  a\r\n\nspecial assessment  of $150.   Smullen  never filed  a direct\r\n\nappeal from  his conviction and  sentence.   On November  30,\r\n\n1994,  Smullen, pro se, filed a motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\r                                  \r\n\n  2255, to vacate, set aside, or  correct his sentence.1  The\r\n\nmotion was  denied by  the district  court,  and Smullen  now\r\n\nappeals.  We affirm.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Smullen has completed his  term of imprisonment.  Because\r\nSmullen was  imprisoned when  he  filed this    2255  motion,\r\njurisdiction to  consider the  motion attached.

At that\r\n\ntime, Smullen  began receiving  disability payments  from the\r\n\nUnited  States Department of  Labor.  Beginning  in May 1982,\r\n\nSmullen began to work full time at the New England Dragway in\r\n\nEpping, New Hampshire.   Smullen worked at the  Dragway until\r\n\nhis  employment was terminated  in 1988.   Smullen then began\r\n\npreparations  to open  a motorcycle  parts and  service shop,\r\n\nPerformance Cycles,  Inc., which  he opened in  January 1989.\r\n\nThroughout  the period  between May  1982 and  February 1990,\r\n\nduring which  Smullen was  employed or self-employed  for all\r\n\nbut a  brief period,  Smullen filed  annual reports with  the\r\n\nUnited  States  Department  of  Labor -  Office  of  Workers'\r\n\nCompensation Programs  falsely stating  that he had  not been\r\n\nemployed or self-employed in  the preceding 15-month  period.\r\n\nAs a result, Smullen obtained disability payments to which he\r\n\nwas not entitled.\r\n\n     Smullen was  charged with  making false statements  to a\r\n\nfederal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C.   1001.   The three-\r\n\ncount indictment  alleged that Smullen  had filed  fraudulent\r\n\nstatements with the  Department of Labor  on form CA-1032  in\r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n1988, 1989, and 1990.  A jury convicted Smullen  on all three\r\n\ncounts.  At sentencing, the district court ordered Smullen to\r\n\npay $121,377.78  in restitution  -- an amount  recommended by\r\n\ndefense counsel.2   The PSR recommended  an offense level  of\r\n\n15; however,  the district  court ordered an  additional two-\r\n\nlevel enhancement  for obstruction  of justice,  finding that\r\n\nSmullen's  trial  testimony  was   \"thorough-going  perjury.\"\r\n\nSmullen's sentencing range was  then set at 24 to  30 months.\r\n\nThe  district court imposed a sentence of 27 months in prison\r\n\nand 36 months  of supervised release.   Although Smullen  did\r\n\nnot  appeal from his conviction or sentence, he later filed a\r\n\nmotion  under  28  U.S.C.    2255  seeking  relief  from  his\r\n\nsentence.  The district court denied this motion, and Smullen\r\n\nappeals.  \r\n\n                             II.\r                                         II.\r\n\n          Smullen argued in his   2255 motion, and now argues\r\n\non appeal,  that errors occurred  in his sentence  because he\r\n\nwas  denied  his  Sixth  Amendment  right  to  the  effective\r\n\nassistance of  counsel.   Smullen contends that:  (1) counsel\r\n\nerred in  not arguing  for a  two-level reduction  in offense\r\n\nlevel for acceptance of  responsibility; (2) counsel erred in\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  The  probation  department   suggested  $168,076  as   an\r\nappropriate  restitution  amount;  the  government  suggested\r\n$147,935.43 in restitution; Smullen's counsel  suggested that\r\nthe proper restitution figure was $121,377.78.\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\nagreeing to an allegedly  excessive loss amount, resulting in\r\n\nan improper Guideline sentencing range; and (3) counsel erred\r\n\nin suggesting a restitution amount approximately $100,000  in\r\n\nexcess of the maximum  amount which could be ordered  by law.\r\n\nOnly the third point  appears to have any substance,  but, as\r\n\nit  is beyond the purview of  a collateral proceeding brought\r\n\nunder 28 U.S.C.   2255, we cannot resolve it.\r\n\n          Smullen's failure to  have raised the above  claims\r\n\non direct appeal from his sentence would normally have barred\r\n\nhim from raising them in a   2255 collateral attack unless he\r\n\ncould show cause for  the failure and actual prejudice.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nColeman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991);  United States\r                                                                         \r\n\nv.  Frady, 456 U.S. 152,  165-67 (1982).   However, cause and\r                     \r\n\nprejudice need not be shown when the underlying claim alleges\r\n\nineffective  assistance of  counsel.   See  Knight v.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates, 37 F.3d  769, 774 (1st Cir. 1994).3  Smullen not only\r                  \r\n\nargues  that his  counsel  performed inadequately  during his\r\n\nsentencing hearing, but also that an appeal relative to these\r\n\nerrors  was  not taken  because  of  his counsel's  allegedly\r\n\nincompetent advice that \"an appeal was just a waste of time.\"\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Similarly,  because  the   purported  sentencing   errors\r\nallegedly arose from ineffective assistance, thus giving them\r\na constitutional  dimension, they may be  considered under 28\r\nU.S.C.    2255 even though  errors in the  application of the\r\nsentencing  guidelines,  by  themselves,  are   not  normally\r\ncognizable on collateral attack.  See Knight, 37 F.3d at 772.\r                                                        \r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n          The   standard  for   constitutionally  ineffective\r\n\nassistance  of  counsel  was   set  forth  in  Strickland  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nWashington, 466  U.S. 668, 687  (1984).  To  succeed, Smullen\r                      \r\n\nhas the burden of showing that (1) counsel's performance fell\r\n\nbelow an objective standard  of reasonableness, and (2) there\r\n\nis a  reasonable probability  that, but for  counsel's error,\r\n\nthe result of the proceedings would have been different.  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nScarpa v.

In order to satisfy  the first prong of the Strickland\r                                                                         \r\n\ntest, Smullen must show that  \"counsel made errors so serious\r\n\nthat counsel was not  functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed\r\n\nthe defendant by the Sixth  Amendment.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S.\r                                                               \r\n\nat 687.

We  cannot attribute error  to counsel for\r                      \r\n\nfailing  to   seek  an  offense  level   reduction  based  on\r\n\nacceptance  of responsibility.  See U.S.S.G.   3E1.1.  As the\r                                               \r\n\nrecord  shows, Smullen never  accepted responsibility for his\r\n\ncrimes.  Smullen pleaded not guilty to each of the counts and\r\n\nmaintained his  innocence throughout  the trial.   See United\r                                                                         \r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\nStates  v. Bennett, 37 F.3d 687, 697 (1st Cir. 1994) (holding\r                              \r\n\nthat U.S.S.G.   3E1.1 is generally not intended to apply to a\r\n\ndefendant who  challenges the essential  factual elements  of\r\n\nguilt).    Moreover,  the  district  court  stated  that  the\r\n\ndefendant's trial testimony was \"thorough-going  perjury\" and\r\n\nimposed a  sentence enhancement  for obstruction  of justice.\r\n\nSee  United States v. Talladino, 38 F.3d 1255, 1265 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1994)  (\"[I]n  the universe  of  cases  where obstruction  of\r\n\njustice  looms, a reduction  for acceptance of responsibility\r\n\nis ordinarily forestalled altogether.\"). \r\n\n          Smullen  has  provided no  better  support for  his\r\n\ncontention that, had his  counsel served him competently, the\r\n\ncourt would have found a lower offense level and,  therefore,\r\n\nhe  would  have  been  sentenced  within  a  lower  Guideline\r\n\nsentencing  range.    Smullen  argues that  the  loss  amount\r\n\nattributed to him as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes\r\n\nwas  excessive, and faults  his lawyer for  not bringing this\r\n\nfact to the court's  attention.  However, the amount  of loss\r\n\nattributed to the petitioner's misconduct related to a period\r\n\nwell within  the duration of \"relevant  conduct\" for purposes\r\n\nof  the Sentencing  Guidelines.   See U.S.S.G.    1B1.3(a)(2)\r                                                 \r\n\n(requiring that relevant conduct be \"part of the same  course\r\n\nof  conduct  or  common scheme  or  plan  as  the offense  of\r\n\nconviction\").  Over an  eight-year period, Smullen engaged in\r\n\na   course  of  conduct  to  fraudulently  obtain  unentitled\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\ndisability benefits.   Smullen's  counsel made no  error, let\r\n\nalone a  constitutionally relevant  one, in failing  to argue\r\n\nfor a lower  loss amount.  As it was,  defense counsel argued\r\n\nfor a  loss amount significantly lower than  that proposed by\r\n\nthe government or by the probation department.\r\n\n          Smullen's third and only  substantial claim is that\r\n\nthe ineffective  assistance of his counsel  contributed to an\r\n\norder for him to  pay an amount of  restitution in excess  of\r\n\nthat permitted by  law.   See United States  v. Ratliff,  999\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d  1023, 1026  (6th Cir.  1993) (\"A  refusal to  appeal an\r\n\nerroneous  restitution  award, which  award  would have  been\r\n\nsubject to reversal on appeal, would meet the Strickland test\r                                                                    \r\n\nand  would  clearly constitute  cause  for  [the] failure  to\r\n\nappeal  the award.\")    If  Smullen's restitution  obligation\r\n\nexceeds  the maximum amount which the  law permits, there may\r\n\nbe a  reasonable probability that counsel's  failure to point\r\n\nthis out contributed to the unfavorable outcome.  Id.  \r                                                                 \r\n\n          It may be, but  we need not decide, that  Smullen's\r\n\nrestitution  obligation did,  in  fact,  exceed  the  maximum\r\n\npermitted  by law,  notwithstanding the  basic equities  that\r\n\nappear  to have prompted it.   The Supreme  Court has limited\r\n\nrestitution to losses caused by the specific conduct that  is\r\n\nthe  basis of  the offense  of conviction.  Hughey v.

The $121,377.78 figure represents the entire\r\n\namount of loss relating to Smullen's false statements  to the\r\n\nDepartment  of  Labor over  the  eight-year  duration of  his\r\n\nfraudulent scheme.  The loss related to the three-year period\r\n\nfor which  the  government actually  secured convictions  was\r\n\napproximately $20,250.93.5   \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n4.  In Hughey, the defendant,  charged in several counts with\r                         \r\nthe use of stolen credit cards, pled guilty to the fraudulent\r\nuse  of one.    The order  for  restitution included  use  of\r\nothers.  The Supreme Court  reversed, saying the outer  limit\r\nfor restitution awards  was \"the loss  caused by the  conduct\r\nunderlying the offense of  conviction.\"  Hughey, 495 U.S.  at\r                                                           \r\n420.\r\n     The  statute authorizing  restitution,  the  Victim  and\r\nWitness  Protection Act  of  1982, specifically  18 U.S.C.   \r\n3663,  was amended  in 1990  to  allow broad  restitution for\r\noffenses involving \"as  an element a scheme, a conspiracy, or\r\na  pattern of criminal activity.\"  Crime Control Act of 1990,\r\nPub. L.  No. 101-647,    2509,  104 Stat.  4789, 4863.   That\r\namendment  does not  apply  here, however,  because Smullen's\r\noffense of  conviction, filing false statements  to a federal\r\nagency in violation  of 18 U.S.C.    1001, did not  include a\r\nplan,  scheme or conspiracy as an element of the offense. See\r                                                                         \r\nUnited States v.

The  $20,250.93  figure  is  the amount  put  forward  by\r\npetitioner.   The government does not  put forward a specific\r\ncalculation of  the amount of  loss specifically attributable\r\nto Smullen's false statements made in 1988, 1989, and 1990.\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\n          As  noted,  this   might  be   attributed  to   the\r\n\nineffective assistance of counsel where, as here, counsel not\r\n\nonly  did  not point  out the  relevant  law to  the district\r\n\njudge, but apparently agreed with the prosecution's erroneous\r\n\ninterpretation.  See  Scarpa, 38 F.3d at  11 (\"Serious errors\r                                        \r\n\nin an  attorney's performance, unrelated to  tactical choices\r\n\nor to  some plausible  strategic aim,  constitute substandard\r\n\nperformance.\").6  However, even assuming  this is so, we  are\r\n\npowerless in a  proceeding under  28 U.S.C.    2255 to  grant\r\n\nrelief to Smullen.  Section 2255 provides:\r\n\n          A prisoner in custody under sentence of a\r\n          court  established  by  Act  of  Congress\r\n          claiming  the right  to be  released upon\r                                                          \r\n          the ground that the sentence  was imposed\r\n          in  violation of the Constitution or laws\r\n          of the  United States, or  that the court\r\n          was without jurisdiction  to impose  such\r\n          sentence,  or  that the  sentence  was in\r\n          excess of the  maximum authorized by law,\r\n          or  is  otherwise  subject to  collateral\r\n          attack,  may move the court which imposed\r\n          the  sentence  to  vacate, set  aside  or\r\n          correct the sentence.\r\n\n28  U.S.C.   2255 (emphasis supplied).

The   government's  attempt   to  avoid   a  finding   of\r\nineffective assistance by arguing that Smullen's counsel  may\r\nhave  been acting strategically  need not be  addressed.

This\r\n\ncourt has  previously held that  a petitioner,  no longer  in\r\n\ncustody,  subject  only  to  a  fine  cannot  challenge  that\r\n\nobligation in a   2255 action.  United States v.

We are  not aware\r                  \r\n\nof any  court of appeals  that, having addressed  this issue,\r\n\nhas reached a contrary result.7\r\n\n          The Fifth and Sixth  Circuits' interpretation of   \r\n\n2255  not only tracks the literal language of the statute but\r\n\nalso  promotes  the equal  treatment  of similar  claims.   A\r\n\ndefendant,  not    in  custody,  sentenced  to  an  allegedly\r\n\nerroneous  fine or restitution  order because  of ineffective\r\n\nassistance of counsel  cannot seek relief  under   2255,  see\r                                                                         \r\n\nMichaud, 901  F.2d at  7, and therefore,  it seems  congruent\r                   \r\n\nthat a petitioner  who is given the  same allegedly erroneous\r\n\nfine  or restitution order but  also happens, at  the time he\r\n\npetitions,  to be  rightfully imprisoned  also should  not be\r\n\nable  to challenge  his monetary  obligation in  a collateral\r\n\nattack.\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  This  Circuit  has  not  authoritatively   addressed  the\r\nquestion  decided by Segler and  Watroba -- whether  or not  \r                                                    \r\n2255 is a proper avenue for  a person in custody to assert an\r\nineffective  assistance  of  counsel  claim  relating to  the\r\nimposition of  a  fine  or restitution  order.    In  several\r\nunpublished opinions  lacking in precedential  force, we have\r\nimplied that a restitution  order can be addressed in    2255\r\nproceedings.   See, e.g., Vela-Fossas v.  United States, 1990\r                                                                   \r\nWL 443937 (1st  Cir. Sept.  7, 1990).   In addition, we  have\r\nassumed  without deciding  that  there  was  jurisdiction  to\r\nchallenge a restitution order under the  former Fed. R. Crim.\r\nP.  35 (which  permitted  the court  to  correct an  \"illegal\r\nsentence\"  at any time).  See United States v. Lilly, 80 F.3d\r                                                                \r\n24, 28 (1st Cir. 1996).  \r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\n          Agreeing  with  the   Fifth  and  Sixth   Circuits'\r\n\nanalyses,   we  hold  that   Smullen  cannot   challenge  his\r\n\nrestitution obligation in this   2255 proceeding.8  \r\n\n          Affirmed.\r                      Affirmed\r                              \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n8.  Should Smullen become incarcerated in the future due to\r\nhis failure to meet the restitution order as the basis for\r\nhis confinement obligations, he may, although we need not\r\ndecide for present purposes, be entitled to bring a   2255\r\naction challenging his restitution at that point.\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n",

Following the only two circuits to have explicitly addressed this matter, we hold he may not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner-appellant Arthur J. Smullen was convicted following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on three counts of making false statements to a federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001.  On May 27, 1993, Smullen was sentenced to 27 months in prison, 36 months of supervised release, restitution in the amount of $121,377.78, and a special assessment of $150.  Smullen never filed a direct appeal from his conviction and sentence.  On November 30, 1994, Smullen, pro se, filed a motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The motion was denied by the district court, and Smullen now appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are taken largely from the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") submitted to the district court by the probation department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen was employed by the United States Post Office until 1974, when he left on total disability.  At that time, Smullen began receiving disability payments from the United States Department of Labor.  Beginning in May 1982, Smullen began to work full time at the New England Dragway in Epping, New Hampshire.  Smullen worked at the Dragway until his employment was terminated in 1988.  Smullen then began preparations to open a motorcycle parts and service shop, Performance Cycles, Inc., which he opened in January 1989.  Throughout the period between May 1982 and February 1990, during which Smullen was employed or self-employed for all but a brief period, Smullen filed annual reports with the United States Department of Labor--Office of Workers' Compensation Programs falsely stating that he had not been employed or self-employed in the preceding 15-month period.  As a result, Smullen obtained disability payments to which he was not entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen was charged with making false statements to a federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001.  The three-count indictment alleged that Smullen had filed fraudulent statements with the Department of Labor on form CA-1032 in 1988, 1989, and 1990.  A jury convicted Smullen on all three counts. At sentencing, the district court ordered Smullen to pay $121,377.78 in restitution--an amount recommended by defense counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The PSR recommended an offense level of 15;  however, the district court ordered an additional two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, finding that Smullen's trial testimony was \"thorough-going perjury.\"   Smullen's sentencing range was then set at 24 to 30 months.  The district court imposed a sentence of 27 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release.  Although Smullen did not appeal from his conviction or sentence, he later filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 seeking relief from his sentence.  The district court denied this motion, and Smullen appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen argued in his &#167; 2255 motion, and now argues on appeal, that errors occurred in his sentence because he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.  Smullen contends that:  (1) counsel erred in not arguing for a two-level reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility;  (2) counsel erred in agreeing to an allegedly excessive loss amount, resulting in an improper Guideline sentencing range;  and (3) counsel erred in suggesting a restitution amount approximately $100,000 in excess of the maximum amount which could be ordered by law.  Only the third point appears to have any substance, but, as it is beyond the purview of a collateral proceeding brought under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, we cannot resolve it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen's failure to have raised the above claims on direct appeal from his sentence would normally have barred him from raising them in a &#167; 2255 collateral attack unless he could show cause for the failure and actual prejudice.  See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 2565, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991);  United States v. Frady, 456 U.S. 152, 165-67, 102 S.Ct. 1584, 1593-94, 71 L.Ed.2d 816 (1982).  However, cause and prejudice need not be shown when the underlying claim alleges ineffective assistance of counsel.  See Knight v. United States, 37 F.3d 769, 774 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Smullen not only argues that his counsel performed inadequately during his sentencing hearing, but also that an appeal relative to these errors was not taken because of his counsel's allegedly incompetent advice that \"an appeal was just a waste of time.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard for constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel was set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).  To succeed, Smullen has the burden of showing that (1) counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness, and (2) there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's error, the result of the proceedings would have been different.  See Scarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 940, 130 L.Ed.2d 885 (1995);  Lopez-Nieves v. United States, 917 F.2d 645, 648 (1st Cir.1990) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064).   In order to satisfy the first prong of the Strickland test, Smullen must show that \"counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.   There is a \"strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"  Id. at 689, 104 S.Ct. at 2065.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first two of Smullen's sentencing claims must be dismissed as Smullen cannot meet either prong of the Strickland test.  We cannot attribute error to counsel for failing to seek an offense level reduction based on acceptance of responsibility.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1.  As the record shows, Smullen never accepted responsibility for his crimes.  Smullen pleaded not guilty to each of the counts and maintained his innocence throughout the trial.  See United States v. Bennett, 37 F.3d 687, 697 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 is generally not intended to apply to a defendant who challenges the essential factual elements of guilt).  Moreover, the district court stated that the defendant's trial testimony was \"thorough-going perjury\" and imposed a sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice.  See United States v. Talladino, 38 F.3d 1255, 1265 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[I]n the universe of cases where obstruction of justice looms, a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is ordinarily forestalled altogether.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen has provided no better support for his contention that, had his counsel served him competently, the court would have found a lower offense level and, therefore, he would have been sentenced within a lower Guideline sentencing range.  Smullen argues that the loss amount attributed to him as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes was excessive, and faults his lawyer for not bringing this fact to the court's attention.  However, the amount of loss attributed to the petitioner's misconduct related to a period well within the duration of \"relevant conduct\" for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2) (requiring that relevant conduct be \"part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction\").  Over an eight-year period, Smullen engaged in a course of conduct to fraudulently obtain unentitled disability benefits.  Smullen's counsel made no error, let alone a constitutionally relevant one, in failing to argue for a lower loss amount.  As it was, defense counsel argued for a loss amount significantly lower than that proposed by the government or by the probation department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen's third and only substantial claim is that the ineffective assistance of his counsel contributed to an order for him to pay an amount of restitution in excess of that permitted by law.  See Ratliff v. United States, 999 F.2d 1023, 1026 (6th Cir.1993) (\"A refusal to appeal an erroneous restitution award, which award would have been subject to reversal on appeal, would meet the Strickland test and would clearly constitute cause for [the] failure to appeal the award.\")   If Smullen's restitution obligation exceeds the maximum amount which the law permits, there may be a reasonable probability that counsel's failure to point this out contributed to the unfavorable outcome.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be, but we need not decide, that Smullen's restitution obligation did, in fact, exceed the maximum permitted by law, notwithstanding the basic equities that appear to have prompted it.  The Supreme Court has limited restitution to losses caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.  Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411, 420, 110 S.Ct. 1979, 1984, 109 L.Ed.2d 408 (1990) (holding that \"the loss caused by the conduct underlying the offense of conviction establishes the outer limits of a restitution order\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Smullen was ordered to repay $121,377.78 in connection with his guilty verdict on three counts relating to false statements submitted to the Department of Labor in 1988, 1989, and 1990.  The $121,377.78 figure represents the entire amount of loss relating to Smullen's false statements to the Department of Labor over the eight-year duration of his fraudulent scheme.  The loss related to the three-year period for which the government actually secured convictions was approximately $20,250.93.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, this might be attributed to the ineffective assistance of counsel where, as here, counsel not only did not point out the relevant law to the district judge, but apparently agreed with the prosecution's erroneous interpretation.  See Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 11 (\"Serious errors in an attorney's performance, unrelated to tactical choices or to some plausible strategic aim, constitute substandard performance.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  However, even assuming this is so, we are powerless in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 to grant relief to Smullen.  Section 2255 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 (emphasis supplied).  The plain language of the statute indicates that &#167; 2255 is available to petitioners \"in custody\" who \"claim[ ] the right to be released\" from custody.  Smullen, while in custody at the time he moved under &#167; 2255, was not \"claiming the right to be released\" but was merely claiming the right to a reduced restitution order establishing the monetary restitution he should pay.  This court has previously held that a petitioner, no longer in custody, subject only to a fine cannot challenge that obligation in a &#167; 2255 action.  United States v. Michaud, 901 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir.1990) (\"A monetary fine is not a sufficient restraint on liberty to meet the 'in custody' requirement for &#167; 2255 purposes[;] [n]or does potential future incarceration for failure to pay such a fine provide the requisite subject matter jurisdiction.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth and Sixth Circuits have held, in cases analogous to the present, that a person in custody cannot bring an ineffective assistance of counsel claim challenging a fine because that person is not \"claiming a right to release\" from custody.  See United States v. Segler, 37 F.3d 1131, 1137 (5th Cir.1994) (\"[I]f counsel's constitutionally insufficient assistance affected the trial court's guilt determination or the sentencer's imposition of a prison term, a prisoner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim falls within the scope of &#167; 2255;  if, as here, it relates only to the imposition of a fine, his claim falls outside &#167; 2255.\");  United States v. Watroba, 56 F.3d 28, 29 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 269, 133 L.Ed.2d 191 (1995);  accord United States v. Gaudet, 81 F.3d 585, 592 (5th Cir.1996).  We are not aware of any court of appeals that, having addressed this issue, has reached a contrary result.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth and Sixth Circuits' interpretation of &#167; 2255 not only tracks the literal language of the statute but also promotes the equal treatment of similar claims.  A defendant, not in custody, sentenced to an allegedly erroneous fine or restitution order because of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot seek relief under &#167; 2255, see Michaud, 901 F.2d at 7, and therefore, it seems congruent that a petitioner who is given the same allegedly erroneous fine or restitution order but also happens, at the time he petitions, to be rightfully imprisoned also should not be able to challenge his monetary obligation in a collateral attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agreeing with the Fifth and Sixth Circuits' analyses, we hold that Smullen cannot challenge his restitution obligation in this &#167; 2255 proceeding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Smullen has completed his term of imprisonment.

No. 101-647, &#167; 2509, 104 Stat. 4789, 4863.   That amendment does not apply here, however, because Smullen's offense of conviction, filing false statements to a federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001, did not include a plan, scheme or conspiracy as an element of the offense.

Following the only two circuits to have explicitly addressed this matter, we hold he may not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioner-appellant Arthur J. Smullen was convicted following a jury trial in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on three counts of making false statements to a federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001.  On May 27, 1993, Smullen was sentenced to 27 months in prison, 36 months of supervised release, restitution in the amount of $121,377.78, and a special assessment of $150.  Smullen never filed a direct appeal from his conviction and sentence.  On November 30, 1994, Smullen, pro se, filed a motion, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The motion was denied by the district court, and Smullen now appeals.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following facts are taken largely from the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") submitted to the district court by the probation department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen was employed by the United States Post Office until 1974, when he left on total disability.  At that time, Smullen began receiving disability payments from the United States Department of Labor.  Beginning in May 1982, Smullen began to work full time at the New England Dragway in Epping, New Hampshire.  Smullen worked at the Dragway until his employment was terminated in 1988.  Smullen then began preparations to open a motorcycle parts and service shop, Performance Cycles, Inc., which he opened in January 1989.  Throughout the period between May 1982 and February 1990, during which Smullen was employed or self-employed for all but a brief period, Smullen filed annual reports with the United States Department of Labor--Office of Workers' Compensation Programs falsely stating that he had not been employed or self-employed in the preceding 15-month period.  As a result, Smullen obtained disability payments to which he was not entitled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen was charged with making false statements to a federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001.  The three-count indictment alleged that Smullen had filed fraudulent statements with the Department of Labor on form CA-1032 in 1988, 1989, and 1990.  A jury convicted Smullen on all three counts. At sentencing, the district court ordered Smullen to pay $121,377.78 in restitution--an amount recommended by defense counsel.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The PSR recommended an offense level of 15;  however, the district court ordered an additional two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, finding that Smullen's trial testimony was \"thorough-going perjury.\"   Smullen's sentencing range was then set at 24 to 30 months.  The district court imposed a sentence of 27 months in prison and 36 months of supervised release.  Although Smullen did not appeal from his conviction or sentence, he later filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 seeking relief from his sentence.  The district court denied this motion, and Smullen appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen argued in his &#167; 2255 motion, and now argues on appeal, that errors occurred in his sentence because he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.  Smullen contends that:  (1) counsel erred in not arguing for a two-level reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility;  (2) counsel erred in agreeing to an allegedly excessive loss amount, resulting in an improper Guideline sentencing range;  and (3) counsel erred in suggesting a restitution amount approximately $100,000 in excess of the maximum amount which could be ordered by law.  Only the third point appears to have any substance, but, as it is beyond the purview of a collateral proceeding brought under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255, we cannot resolve it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen's failure to have raised the above claims on direct appeal from his sentence would normally have barred him from raising them in a &#167; 2255 collateral attack unless he could show cause for the failure and actual prejudice.

Moreover, the district court stated that the defendant's trial testimony was \"thorough-going perjury\" and imposed a sentence enhancement for obstruction of justice.  See United States v. Talladino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"680706\"><a href=\"/opinion/680706/nazzaro-scarpa-v-larry-e-dubois-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>255, 1265 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[I]n the universe of cases where obstruction of justice looms, a reduction for acceptance of responsibility is ordinarily forestalled altogether.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen has provided no better support for his contention that, had his counsel served him competently, the court would have found a lower offense level and, therefore, he would have been sentenced within a lower Guideline sentencing range.  Smullen argues that the loss amount attributed to him as relevant conduct for sentencing purposes was excessive, and faults his lawyer for not bringing this fact to the court's attention.  However, the amount of loss attributed to the petitioner's misconduct related to a period well within the duration of \"relevant conduct\" for purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines.  See U.S.S.G. &#167; 1B1.3(a)(2) (requiring that relevant conduct be \"part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction\").  Over an eight-year period, Smullen engaged in a course of conduct to fraudulently obtain unentitled disability benefits.  Smullen's counsel made no error, let alone a constitutionally relevant one, in failing to argue for a lower loss amount.  As it was, defense counsel argued for a loss amount significantly lower than that proposed by the government or by the probation department.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Smullen's third and only substantial claim is that the ineffective assistance of his counsel contributed to an order for him to pay an amount of restitution in excess of that permitted by law.  See Ratliff v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"612134\"><a href=\"/opinion/612134/daryl-e-ratliff-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1023</span></a></span>, 1026 (6th Cir.1993) (\"A refusal to appeal an erroneous restitution award, which award would have been subject to reversal on appeal, would meet the Strickland test and would clearly constitute cause for [the] failure to appeal the award.\")   If Smullen's restitution obligation exceeds the maximum amount which the law permits, there may be a reasonable probability that counsel's failure to point this out contributed to the unfavorable outcome.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It may be, but we need not decide, that Smullen's restitution obligation did, in fact, exceed the maximum permitted by law, notwithstanding the basic equities that appear to have prompted it.  The Supreme Court has limited restitution to losses caused by the specific conduct that is the basis of the offense of conviction.  Hughey v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112428\"><a href=\"/opinion/112428/hughey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">495</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span>, 420, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112428\"><a href=\"/opinion/112428/hughey-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">408</span></a></span> (1990) (holding that \"the loss caused by the conduct underlying the offense of conviction establishes the outer limits of a restitution order\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Smullen was ordered to repay $121,377.78 in connection with his guilty verdict on three counts relating to false statements submitted to the Department of Labor in 1988, 1989, and 1990.  The $121,377.78 figure represents the entire amount of loss relating to Smullen's false statements to the Department of Labor over the eight-year duration of his fraudulent scheme.  The loss related to the three-year period for which the government actually secured convictions was approximately $20,250.93.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, this might be attributed to the ineffective assistance of counsel where, as here, counsel not only did not point out the relevant law to the district judge, but apparently agreed with the prosecution's erroneous interpretation.  See Scarpa, 38 F.3d at 11 (\"Serious errors in an attorney's performance, unrelated to tactical choices or to some plausible strategic aim, constitute substandard performance.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  However, even assuming this is so, we are powerless in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 to grant relief to Smullen.  Section 2255 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>A prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 (emphasis supplied).  The plain language of the statute indicates that &#167; 2255 is available to petitioners \"in custody\" who \"claim[ ] the right to be released\" from custody.  Smullen, while in custody at the time he moved under &#167; 2255, was not \"claiming the right to be released\" but was merely claiming the right to a reduced restitution order establishing the monetary restitution he should pay.  This court has previously held that a petitioner, no longer in custody, subject only to a fine cannot challenge that obligation in a &#167; 2255 action.  United States v. Michaud, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539957\"><a href=\"/opinion/539957/united-states-v-hubert-michaud/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.1990) (\"A monetary fine is not a sufficient restraint on liberty to meet the 'in custody' requirement for &#167; 2255 purposes[;] [n]or does potential future incarceration for failure to pay such a fine provide the requisite subject matter jurisdiction.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth and Sixth Circuits have held, in cases analogous to the present, that a person in custody cannot bring an ineffective assistance of counsel claim challenging a fine because that person is not \"claiming a right to release\" from custody.  See United States v. Segler, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679987\"><a href=\"/opinion/679987/united-states-v-joe-clinton-segler/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1131</span></a></span>, 1137 (5th Cir.1994) (\"[I]f counsel's constitutionally insufficient assistance affected the trial court's guilt determination or the sentencer's imposition of a prison term, a prisoner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim falls within the scope of &#167; 2255;  if, as here, it relates only to the imposition of a fine, his claim falls outside &#167; 2255.\");  United States v.

A defendant, not in custody, sentenced to an allegedly erroneous fine or restitution order because of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot seek relief under &#167; 2255, see Michaud, 901 F.2d at 7, and therefore, it seems congruent that a petitioner who is given the same allegedly erroneous fine or restitution order but also happens, at the time he petitions, to be rightfully imprisoned also should not be able to challenge his monetary obligation in a collateral attack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Agreeing with the Fifth and Sixth Circuits' analyses, we hold that Smullen cannot challenge his restitution obligation in this &#167; 2255 proceeding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Smullen has completed his term of imprisonment.

No. 101-647, &#167; 2509, 104 Stat. 4789, 4863.   That amendment does not apply here, however, because Smullen's offense of conviction, filing false statements to a federal agency in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1001, did not include a plan, scheme or conspiracy as an element of the offense.  See United States v.

In several unpublished opinions lacking in precedential force, we have implied that a restitution order can be addressed in &#167; 2255 proceedings.  See, e.g., Vela-Fossas v.
