William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\r\n\n                         Before\r\n\n                Torruella, Chief Judge,\r\n          Boudin and Stahl, Circuit Judges.\r\n\nMiriam Conrad, Federal Public Defender, for appellant.\r\nDeborah Watson, Attorney, with whom Donald K. Stern, United\r\nStates Attorney, Theodore B. Heinrich, Assistant United States\r\nAttorney, and Allison D. Burroughs, Assistant United States\r\nAttorney, were on brief for appellee.\r\n\nMarch 2, 1999\r\n\nSTAHL, Circuit Judge.   Following a twenty-one day trial,\r\na jury convicted defendant-appellant Dwayne Owens on a number of\r\nserious charges including murder, racketeering, cocaine\r\ndistribution,  being a fugitive in possession of a firearm, and\r\nmoney laundering.  In this appeal, Owens challenges his convictions\r\non various grounds.  After a careful review of the record and\r\nOwens's arguments, we affirm.\r\n      I.  Prior Proceedings and Appellate Issues\r\nOn May 14, 1996, a grand jury returned a twenty-seven\r\ncount indictment against Owens and others.  Underlying this\r\nindictment was the government's allegation that, from 1988 to 1995,\r\nOwens ran a large-scale drug enterprise that obtained cocaine from\r\nsuppliers in New York and Florida for distribution in\r\nMassachusetts.  The government also accused Owens of possessing\r\nnumerous handguns, resorting to violence and threats of violence to\r\nprotect his drug interests, and of the murder of one Rodney Belle,\r\nwho had double-crossed him in a drug deal.\r\nPrior to trial, Owens moved to suppress the fruits of a\r\nsearch of his home at 26 Parsons Avenue in East Providence, Rhode\r\nIsland and a search of an automobile in which he was a passenger,\r\nconducted on an interstate highway in Memphis, Tennessee.  In\r\naddition, he requested a hearing pursuant to Franks v. Delaware,\r\n438 U.S. 154 (1978) (holding that the Fourth Amendment entitles a\r\ndefendant to a hearing if he establishes a prima facie case that a\r\nsearch warrant affidavit included knowingly or recklessly false\r\nstatements).  Although the district court denied Owens's request\r\nfor a Franks hearing, it did conduct a six-day evidentiary hearing\r\non the motions to suppress, concluding that most of the objected to\r\nevidence was properly seized.\r\nWhen the case was submitted to the jury, Owens was the\r\nsole remaining defendant.  He was convicted on all charges\r\npertaining to the murder of Rodney Belle, conspiracy to murder\r\nRodney Belle, violations of the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt\r\nOrganization (\"RICO\") Act, RICO conspiracy, interstate travel in\r\naid of RICO, conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine, using\r\nand carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, being a fugitive\r\nfrom justice in possession of a firearm, and money laundering.  The\r\njury acquitted him on a number of other charges.  The district\r\ncourt sentenced Owens to life imprisonment.  \r\nOn appeal, Owens makes a number of arguments which fall\r\ninto three main categories.  First, he challenges the district\r\ncourt's denial of his motions to suppress.  Second, he argues that\r\nthere was insufficient evidence to support his RICO convictions. \r\nFinally, he contends that the court delivered a number of flawed\r\njury instructions. \r\nWe discuss each issue in turn after setting forth in\r\ncontext the relevant underlying facts.\r\n             II.  The Suppression Motions\r\nA.  Standard of Review\r\nWe review a district court's factual findings for clear\r\nerror.  See United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 525 (1st Cir.),\r\ncert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 771 (1996).  Where specific findings are\r\nlacking, we view the record in the light most favorable to the\r\nruling, drawing all reasonable inferences in support of the\r\nchallenged ruling.  See id. at 529.  We review a district court's\r\nlegal conclusions de novo.  See United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d\r\n1005, 1008 (1st Cir. 1993).  In the end, we defer to a district\r\ncourt's denial of a suppression motion, so long as it is supported\r\nby any reasonable view of the evidence.  See id.\r\nB.  26 Parsons Avenue Search\r\n1.  Background\r\nIn May 1995, Boston police notified East Providence\r\npolice that a man known as Don Miley, alias Dwayne Owens, was\r\nwanted for homicide in Boston, and that an accomplice of this man\r\nwas cooperating with the police.  This accomplice gave Boston\r\npolice information about the suspect's drug trafficking activities\r\nand described his residence in East Providence.  On May 18, 1995,\r\nEast Providence Police Captain Joseph Broadmeadow submitted an\r\naffidavit in support of an application for a warrant to search\r\nOwens's home at 26 Parsons Avenue.  The warrant was granted and\r\nauthorized police to search for \"a black male, age 32, known as Don\r\nMiley, alias Dwayne Owens, alias [sic] with a date of birth of 6-9-\r\n63, also firearms, ammunition.\"  The police executed the warrant on\r\nMay 19, during Owens's absence from the residence, and seized\r\nextensive evidence including not only guns, ammunition, illegal\r\ndrugs, and drug paraphernalia, but also personal documents, some of\r\nwhich were found in manila folders and envelopes.\r\nOwens's motion to suppress the fruits of this search\r\nargued (1) that the warrant application failed to establish\r\nprobable cause and the good-faith exception to the exclusionary\r\nrule did not apply; and (2) that the police exceeded the scope of\r\ntheir search.  As an adjunct to his suppression motion, he also\r\nmoved for a Franks hearing.  \r\nThe district court granted in part and denied in part\r\nOwens's suppression motion, ruling that the warrant application\r\nestablished probable cause to search for firearms and ammunition,\r\nand that even if probable cause to search did not support the\r\nwarrant, most of the items seized were admissible under the \"good-\r\nfaith exception\" recognized in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897,\r\n922 (1984) (holding that evidence seized in reasonable good-faith\r\nreliance on a search warrant, which is later found defective, may\r\nbe admitted at trial).  As to the scope of the search, the court\r\ndetermined that certain evidence was properly seized because it was\r\nin plain view and immediately apparent as evidence of a crime or as\r\nevidence that would help lead to the apprehension of Owens, whom\r\nthe officers reasonably believed was a fugitive.  Although the\r\ncourt granted Owens's motion with respect to some items seized\r\nduring the search, ruling that these documents were not immediately\r\napparent as relevant evidence, in the end, it admitted most of the\r\nseized items, including the drugs, drug paraphernalia, and certain\r\npersonal documents.  The court denied Owens's request for a Frankshearing, finding that Owens failed to make a substantial\r\npreliminary showing that Officer Broadmeadow's affidavit contained\r\nany deliberately false or recklessly false statements.\r\n     2.  Discussion\r\nOn appeal, Owens renews the two arguments made in his\r\nmotion to suppress.  He also contends that the district court\r\nimproperly denied his request for a Franks hearing.  We disagree.\r\n          a.   Probable Cause and Leon's Good-Faith\r\n               Exception\r\n\nAssuming arguendo that the warrant for 26 Parsons Avenue\r\nwas not supported by probable cause, we agree with the district\r\ncourt that the executing officers reasonably relied in good faith\r\non a facially valid warrant.  We therefore need not assess the\r\nconstitutionality of the warrant and simply hold that the district\r\ncourt committed no error in denying the motion to suppress.  SeeLeon, 468 U.S. at 925 (courts have discretion to consider the issue\r\nof officers' good faith without first addressing Fourth Amendment\r\nissue).\r\nThere are four exclusions to the Leon good-faith\r\nexception: (1) \"when the magistrate . . . was misled by information\r\nin an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known\r\nwas false except for his reckless disregard for the truth;\" (2)\r\n\"where the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his [detached and\r\nneutral] judicial role;\" (3) where the affidavit is \"so lacking in\r\nindicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its\r\nexistence entirely unreasonable;\" and (4) where a warrant is \"so\r\nfacially deficient -- i.e. in failing to particularize the place to\r\nbe searched or the things to be seized -- that the executing\r\nofficers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.\"  Id. at 923. \r\nOwens contends that the 26 Parsons Avenue search implicates the\r\nfirst and fourth exclusions.\r\n               i.   False Information in Affidavit\r\nAccording to Owens, the affidavit improperly misled the\r\nmagistrate in three respects.  First, it claimed that the Boston\r\npolice had a murder warrant for Don Miley when in fact the murder\r\nwarrant identified the suspect only as Dwayne Owens.  Second, it\r\nmisstated that business records indicated Be Be's Barbecue was\r\n\"owned and incorporated by Don Miley\" when Don Miley was only\r\nlisted in corporate documents as Vice President.  And third, its\r\nstatement that phone number 436-6658 was located at 26 Parsons\r\nAvenue improperly omitted that the number listed was in the name of\r\nJohnny Stephens, not Don Miley.    \r\nOwens's claims fail because he cannot establish that\r\nthese misstatements were either knowingly false or reckless.  At\r\nmost, Broadmeadow's errors resulted from negligence, and\r\n\"[a]llegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient.\" \r\nFranks, 438 U.S. at 171.\r\nMoreover, even if any of the misstatements were knowingly\r\nfalse or reckless, we do not see how they were material.  SeeUnited States v. Vanness, 85 F.3d 661, 662-63 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\r\n(warrant valid under Leon because false statement not material). \r\nThe affidavit's statement that a warrant existed for \"Miley,\"\r\nrather than \"Owens,\" was immaterial because the affidavit also\r\nindicated that the subject known as \"Miley\" used the alias \"Owens.\" \r\nNor can the statement that Miley was named in business records as\r\nowner rather than Vice President be characterized as material\r\nbecause, in either event, the suspect was linked to Be Be's\r\nBarbecue.  Cf. State v. Groff, 323 N.W.2d 204, 210 (Iowa 1982)\r\n(stating that defendant \"owns\" land on which marijuana is growing,\r\nrather than that \"he farms the land,\" is not materially false). \r\nFinally, the affidavit's failure to recite that telephone number\r\n436-6658 was listed in the name of Johnny Stephens was not material\r\nunder the circumstances.  Police questioning of the landlord of 26\r\nParsons Avenue had already established that a man known as Miley\r\nwas living at that address.  It was immaterial whether Miley was\r\nliving there alone or with others.  \r\n               ii.  Facially Deficient Warrant\r\nAccording to Owens, it was unreasonable for the executing\r\nofficers to rely on a warrant that he characterizes as so facially\r\ndeficient as to be \"bare bones.\"  In particular, Owens complains\r\nthat the affidavit demonstrated neither the recency of the\r\ninformation relied upon nor a nexus between the firearms and 26\r\nParsons Avenue.  We disagree.\r\nDespite Owens's complaints, the affidavit was\r\nsufficiently current because it stated that an \"active warrant\"\r\nexisted for Owens, that an informant \"is cooperating\" (emphasis\r\nadded) with Boston police, and that the informant described a Cole\r\nStreet address as \"being used\" (emphasis added) by Owens in his\r\ndrug business.  From this, the executing officers could reasonably\r\nhave inferred that the informant's data were recent and described\r\nan ongoing drug operation and access to firearms.  Cf. United\r\nStates v. Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir. 1996) (affidavit\r\nnot stale because references by informant were in the present tense\r\nand therefore implied regular ongoing transactions); United Statesv. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 568 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[I]t is common\r\nground that drug conspiracies tend to be ongoing operations,\r\nrendering timely information that might, in other contexts, be\r\nregarded as stale.\"). \r\nOwens's complaint that the affidavit failed to establish\r\nany nexus between the firearms and 26 Parsons Avenue similarly\r\nfails.  The affidavit recited that Owens was wanted for murder, had\r\n\"numerous firearms,\" and rented a house at 26 Parsons Avenue. \r\nBased on this information, it was reasonable for the executing\r\nofficers to believe that firearms would be found at 26 Parsons\r\nAvenue.  Cf. United States v. Procopio, 88 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir.)\r\n(nexus between evidence of crime and address to be searched\r\nsufficiently established where affidavit recited that suspect lived\r\nat that address), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 620 (1996).\r\n          b.   The Scope of the Search\r\nOwens concedes that if the police were lawfully present\r\nat 26 Parsons Avenue, as we have just concluded, then the firearms\r\nand ammunition were properly seized within the scope of the search\r\nwarrant, and the drugs and paraphernalia were properly seized\r\npursuant to the plain view doctrine.  He contends, however, that\r\nthe police officers exceeded the proper scope of the search when\r\nthey seized various personal documents which were not in plain\r\nview.\r\nA plain view seizure is lawful if (1) the seizing officer\r\nhas a prior justification for being in a position to see the item\r\nin plain view and (2) the evidentiary value of the item is\r\nimmediately apparent.  See Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 136\r\n(1990).  According to Owens, the officers improperly seized various\r\npersonal documents because the evidentiary value of these documents\r\nwas not \"immediately apparent.\"  In particular, Owens contests the\r\nseizure of the following documents, which were introduced as\r\nevidence at trial: address books, telephone bills, papers\r\ncontaining names and numbers, money order receipts, documents\r\nregarding gun purchases by Andrea Frith Jones, a photograph of\r\nhimself with a pile of money, and a birth certificate for Donald\r\nMiley.  Together, these documents helped the government establish\r\nthat Owens had engaged in years of drug trafficking; had access to\r\nand used guns in connection with his drug enterprise; had access to\r\nlarge amounts of money; and used an alias.  \r\nOwens's argument that the seizure of these items exceeded\r\nthe scope of the authorized search is not without force.  But,\r\nassuming arguendo that the seizure of various documents was\r\nunlawful, the admission of such evidence at trial was harmless\r\nerror beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Milton v. Wainwright, 407\r\nU.S. 371, 372-73 (1972) (stating that where the jury, in addition\r\nto hearing erroneously admitted testimony, is \"presented with\r\noverwhelming evidence of petitioner's guilt,\" error is harmless\r\nbeyond a reasonable doubt).  The seized documents merely\r\ncorroborated the damaging and voluminous testimony which the\r\ngovernment introduced at trial.  Four participants in the\r\nenterprise testified that Owens and his colleagues engaged in years\r\nof drug trafficking.  Eight witnesses variously testified that they\r\nhad purchased weapons for Owens; Owens carried a weapon with him\r\nalmost all the time; Owens was seen with weapons on various\r\noccasions; and Owens kept numerous weapons in his apartment.  Five\r\nwitnesses testified that they had seen Owens with large amounts of\r\ncash on a number of occasions.  And finally, the testimony of three\r\nwitnesses amply established that Owens used the alias Don Miley. \r\nIn admitting the documents, the district court's error, if any, was\r\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n          c.   Franks Hearing\r\nOwens also contends that the court improperly denied his\r\nmotion for a Franks hearing.  As we have stated, under Franks, a\r\ndefendant may overcome the presumption that a warrant affidavit is \r\nvalid by making a \"substantial preliminary showing that a false\r\nstatement knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard\r\nfor the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant\r\naffidavit.\"  438 U.S. at 155-56.  For the reasons discussed supraat Part II-B-2-a-i, we see no clear error in the district court's\r\ndetermination that Owens failed to make a substantial preliminary\r\nshowing that the affidavit contained knowingly false or reckless\r\nstatements.  See United States v. Parcels of Land, 903 F.2d 36, 46\r\n(1st Cir. 1990) (a district court's determination that the\r\nrequisite showing for a Franks hearing is reviewed for clear\r\nerror).  Thus, we affirm the district court's denial of Owens's\r\nmotion for a Franks hearing.\r\nC.  Tennessee Automobile Stop\r\n     1.  Background\r\nOn November 13, 1995, Patrolman Andy Boyd of the Shelby\r\nCounty Sheriff's Office stopped a Black Ford Thunderbird for\r\nspeeding on a highway in Memphis, Tennessee.  Owens was a passenger\r\nin that car.  Boyd asked the driver, Devone Robinson, for his\r\ndriver's license, and Robinson responded that he did not have his\r\nlicense with him.  Boyd then asked Robinson to step out of the\r\nThunderbird and into the patrol car so that he could do a license\r\ncheck.  Robinson complied.\r\nNext, Boyd separately questioned Robinson and Owens, and\r\nreceived conflicting responses from both men.  For instance, when\r\nBoyd asked Robinson where he was from, Robinson responded that he\r\nlived in North Carolina, even though he had earlier stated that he\r\nwas from Massachusetts and Virginia.  In response to Boyd's request\r\nfor Owens's name, Owens responded \"Robert.\"  Robinson, however,\r\nstated that his passenger was named \"Jay.\"  The two also gave\r\nconflicting accounts of who owned the car.  Robinson first stated\r\nthat it belonged to Jay, then later stated that it belonged to\r\nJay's friend.  Owens, meanwhile, provided police with a vehicle\r\nregistration showing the owner to be Kenneth Allen, whom Owens\r\nidentified as his brother-in-law.\r\nThese contradicting statements having raised his\r\nsuspicions, Boyd requested assistance, and Sergeant Mark Kellerhall\r\narrived shortly on the scene.  The officers then called for a drug\r\ndog, which had to be transported from the airport at the other side\r\nof the city.  They also initiated a vehicle registration check,\r\ncriminal history checks, and a National Crime Information Center\r\n(\"NCIC\") check to determine whether the car was stolen.  \r\nAbout fourteen minutes into the stop, Robinson admitted\r\nthat his Virginia driver's license had been suspended, a fact that\r\nthe police radio channel confirmed five minutes later.  Boyd then\r\narrested Robinson for driving without a license.  Normal procedure\r\nfor the Shelby County Sheriff's Office dictates that when the\r\ndriver-owner of a car is arrested, he is asked to sign a form\r\nauthorizing the car's release to a passenger.  In this case,\r\nhowever, the registered owner was not present, and the police\r\ncontinued to receive conflicting responses from the driver and the\r\npassenger regarding ownership of the car.  After his arrest,\r\nRobinson changed his earlier position and stated, while pointing to\r\nOwens, that the car belonged to \"Kenny.\"  Under these\r\ncircumstances, the officers elected to await the results of the\r\nvehicle registration check and other inquiries to determine whether\r\nOwens had actual authority to drive the car.  They did so even\r\nafter a computer check revealed that the license provided by Owens,\r\nalias Davis, was valid.\r\nAbout 29 minutes into the stop, the officers received the\r\nresults of the criminal history checks, which indicated that\r\nRobinson had a cocaine possession charge, and that the registered\r\nowner, Kenneth Allen, had two cocaine trafficking charges and an\r\narmed robbery charge.  The officers also received the results of\r\nthe NCIC check, indicating that the vehicle had not been reported\r\nstolen.  Boyd nonetheless waited for the results of the vehicle\r\nregistration check rather than permit Owens to drive away because\r\nhe believed that stolen cars did not always appear on the NCIC\r\ndatabase.\r\nAbout 49-50 minutes into the stop, while the officers\r\nwere still waiting for the results of the vehicle registration\r\ncheck, the canine unit arrived.  The police had the drug dog,\r\nTorque, conduct a sniff test on the outside of the vehicle.  Torque\r\nalerted to the car, indicating the presence of drugs.  The officers\r\nthereupon searched the car and found, in a secret compartment, a\r\nloaded .40 caliber Ruger, a .380 Cobray Uzi, ammunition for the\r\nUzi, over $16,000 in cash, and several address and ledger books. \r\nThe police seized all the objects in the compartment.  The\r\ngovernment introduced this evidence at trial.  Subsequent clinical\r\ntests on the car revealed no drugs and no drug residue.\r\nOwens moved to suppress the evidence seized in this\r\nsearch, arguing: (1) the length of the investigative stop made the\r\nstop an unlawful detention; (2) the drug dog was unreliable, so the\r\nofficers lacked probable cause to search the car for contraband;\r\nand (3) even if the search was, at bottom, lawful, the officers\r\nexceeded its scope in seizing the address books and ledgers.  \r\nThe district court denied Owens's motion.  The court\r\nfound that Officer Boyd had properly stopped the Thunderbird for\r\nspeeding and arrested Robinson for driving without a license.  The\r\ncourt also ruled that the officers were justified in detaining the\r\nThunderbird during the time they investigated whether Owens had\r\nactual authority to drive the car.  In evaluating the propriety of\r\nthe dog sniff, the court reasoned that exposing the outside of the\r\ncar to a dog sniff did not implicate the Fourth Amendment, and once\r\nthe dog alerted to the car, the officers had probable cause to\r\nsearch the interior.  Rejecting Owens's argument that the officers\r\nexceeded the lawful scope of their search, the court held that the\r\nsearch was appropriate as to all items seized from the secret\r\ncompartment. \r\n     2.  Discussion\r\nOwens contends that the district court erred in denying\r\nhis motion, and renews on appeal the arguments presented in his\r\nmotion to suppress.  Again, we disagree with Owens's contentions.\r\n          a.  The Length of the Stop\r\nIn evaluating the propriety of the Tennessee stop, we\r\napply a two-prong test.  First, we must determine whether the\r\n\"officer[s'] actions were justified at [their] inception,\" and if\r\nso, \"whether the actions undertaken by the officer[s] following the\r\nstop were reasonably responsive to the circumstances justifying the\r\nstop in the first place as augmented by information gleaned by the\r\nofficer[s] during the stop.\"  United States v. Sowers, 136 F.3d 24,\r\n27 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 119 S. Ct. 105 (1998).\r\nOwens does not challenge the initial automobile stop for\r\nspeeding as invalid under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). \r\nSee Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 439 (1984) (\"[T]he usual\r\ntraffic stop is more analogous to a so called 'Terry stop' . . .\r\nthan to a formal arrest.\").  Rather, he contends that the fifty-\r\nminute detention was too long in duration to be justified as an\r\ninvestigative stop.  Thus, his argument hinges on whether the\r\nlength of the detention converted the otherwise valid investigative\r\nstop into a de facto arrest for which probable cause was lacking. \r\nThe reasonableness inquiry is almost always fact\r\nspecific.  See United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.\r\n1994) (noting that \"[t]here is no scientifically precise formula\r\nthat enables courts to distinguish between valid investigatory\r\nstops and de facto arrests\").  The Supreme Court has directed\r\ncourts making this inquiry to examine\r\nwhether the police diligently pursued a means\r\nof investigation that was likely to confirm or\r\ndispel their suspicions quickly, during which\r\ntime it was necessary to detain the defendant. \r\nA court making this assessment should take\r\ncare to consider whether the police are acting\r\nin a swiftly developing situation, and in such\r\ncases the court should not indulge in\r\nunrealistic second-guessing.\r\n\nUnited States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 686 (1985) (citations\r\nomitted).\r\nThe fifty-minute detention was indeed a lengthy one, and\r\nin other circumstances would perhaps weigh in favor of finding a defacto arrest.  A long duration, however, does not by itself\r\ntransform an otherwise valid stop into an arrest.  See McCarthy, 77\r\nF.3d at 530 (stating that \"there is no talismanic time beyond which\r\nany stop initially justified on the basis of Terry becomes an\r\nunreasonable seizure under the [F]ourth [A]mendment\") (citation\r\nomitted).  Here, the period of detention was justified.  The\r\nofficers necessarily spent the first twenty minutes trying to\r\nascertain whether Robinson had a valid driver's license, which he\r\ndid not.  It was only after arresting Robinson that the officers\r\nfaced the problem of whether to permit Owens to drive a car that he\r\ndid not own.  Moreover, events unfolded in such a manner as to\r\nraise the officers' suspicions regarding Owens's authority to drive\r\nthe car: Robinson and Owens gave conflicting stories about who\r\nowned the car and Owens was evasive and avoided eye-contact during\r\npolice questioning.\r\nIn responding to the circumstances, the officers\r\ndiligently pursued a means of investigation that would dispel their\r\nsuspicions.  They initiated a number of computer checks on the car\r\nand its occupants and reasonably awaited the results.  Cf. United\r\nStates v. Morales-Zamora, 914 F.2d 200, 203 (10th Cir. 1990)\r\n(holding that detention of defendants' vehicles was reasonable\r\nduring time that officers completed inspections of defendants'\r\ndocuments); United States v. Walker, 933 F.2d 812, 816 n.2 (10th\r\nCir. 1991) (suggesting in dicta that length of detention would have\r\nbeen reasonable if police were waiting for results of an NCIC,\r\nlicense, or registration inquiry).  \r\nUnder these particular facts, the detention was not a defacto arrest and the district court's finding that the officers\r\nresponded reasonably to the circumstances as they developed is\r\nsupported by the evidence.\r\n          b.  Reliability of Drug Dog\r\nThe existence of probable cause based on an alert by a\r\ndrug dog depends upon the dog's reliability.  See United States v.\r\nRace, 529 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1976).  During the suppression\r\nhearing, Owens and the government introduced conflicting evidence\r\nregarding Torque's reliability.  Owens offered the testimony of Dr.\r\nDan Craig, an expert on animal behavior, who, after reviewing\r\nrecords of Torque's failure to pass two certification tests as well\r\nas his training and performance, concluded that Torque was not\r\nreliable in vehicle searches.\r\nThe government introduced the testimony of Mark\r\nRobertson, the training supervisor for the Shelby County Sheriff's\r\ndrug interdiction team, who offered explanations for Torque's\r\nfailure in the certification tests.  Robertson claimed\r\nresponsibility for Torque's first failure, stating that he had\r\nprematurely entered the then newly trained dog in a national test\r\nagainst top dogs.  He attributed Torque's second failure to handler\r\nerror.  He also emphasized that Torque was certified at the time of\r\nthe Tennessee stop.  In the end, Robertson testified that Torque\r\nwas an extremely reliable dog, and that Torque and his handler were\r\namong the best.  Torque's handler, Carrole Owen, also testified for\r\nthe government, and opined that Torque's reliability was excellent. \r\nThe district court ultimately credited the government's\r\ntestimony and determined that Torque was sufficiently reliable to\r\nsupport a finding of probable cause.  With due deference to the\r\ndistrict court's greater ability to gauge the demeanor and\r\ncredibility of the witnesses, we cannot say that the court's\r\nfinding was clearly erroneous. \r\n          c.  Seizure of Address Books\r\nFinally, Owens asserts that even if the police officers\r\nhad probable cause to search the car, they wrongly seized address\r\nbooks and notebooks, which were outside the scope of the plain view\r\ndoctrine because their incriminating nature was not immediately\r\napparent.  \r\nOwens's arguments are misplaced: officers who have\r\nprobable cause to search a car for contraband are not limited in\r\nthe scope of their search by the plain view doctrine.  See United\r\nStates v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 800 (1982).  Rather, \"[i]f probable\r\ncause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it\r\njustifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents\r\nthat may conceal the object of the search.\"  Id. at 825.\r\nHere, the officers had probable cause to believe that the\r\nautomobile contained drugs and evidence of drug trafficking.  The\r\naddress books and notebooks were concealed in a secret compartment,\r\ntogether with a large amount of cash, two guns, and ostensibly a\r\nresidue of drugs.  Under these circumstances, the police had\r\nprobable cause to believe that the address books and notebooks were\r\nevidence of drug trafficking and thus properly seized them.  \r\n          III.  Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\nA.  Standard of Review\r\nOwens argues that his RICO convictions must be set aside\r\nbecause the government offered insufficient proof of the\r\n\"enterprise\" charged in the indictment and of Owens's participation\r\nin that enterprise.  In considering Owens's sufficiency claims, we\r\nmust \"view the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences\r\nthat may be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the\r\ngovernment, . . . [and consider] whether a rational trier of fact\r\ncould have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  United Statesv. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 589 (1st Cir. 1994) (citations and internal\r\nquotation marks omitted).  After examining the evidence under this\r\nstandard, we reject Owens's arguments.\r\nB.  Background Facts\r\nThe indictment charged Owens and one Keillen Smith with\r\nbeing leaders of an enterprise, consisting of individuals\r\n\"associated in fact,\" which operated from 1988 to 1995 and engaged\r\nin drug trafficking and acts of violence, including murder.  The\r\nalleged purpose of the enterprise included \"enriching members\r\nthrough drug trafficking and drug distribution;\" \"preserving,\r\nprotecting and expanding the power and control of the enterprise\r\nthrough the use of murder, violence, threats of violence, and\r\nintimidation;\" and \"promoting and enhancing the enterprise and its\r\nmembers' drug trafficking and related activities.\"  \r\nDuring trial, the government introduced evidence that\r\nOwens and Smith were the major players in an organization, made up\r\nof two sub-groups, that supplied cocaine to the Boston area. \r\nOwens, assisted by Johnny Stephens, Robert Owens, and Coleman\r\nEssex, was in charge of supplying the organization with cocaine. \r\nSmith, assisted by Kenneth Allen, Anthony Lewis, Charles Brown,\r\nWayne Meadows, and Gordon Lowe, was responsible for packaging and\r\ndistributing the cocaine in the Boston area.\r\nOwens first began selling cocaine to Smith in ounce\r\nquantities in 1987.  By 1990, Smith had become a large-scale\r\ndistributor for Owens, purchasing and reselling cocaine by the\r\nkilogram.  Owens continued to sell cocaine to Smith even after\r\nOwens left Boston and began to move from state to state in order to\r\navoid arrest.  In early 1991, Owens relocated to Providence, Rhode\r\nIsland, where he continued his drug trafficking activities until\r\nhis arrest in 1995.  While in Providence, Owens sold cocaine to\r\nSmith on a near weekly basis for $20,000 to $25,000 a kilogram. \r\nAlthough Smith sometimes personally collected the drugs from Owens,\r\nhe usually had Lewis, Brown, or Meadows travel to Rhode Island from\r\nMassachusetts to pick up kilogram quantities.  The men would return\r\nwith the drugs in Owens's Thunderbird, which Owens had outfitted\r\nwith hidden compartments.  In Boston, Smith and his group \"cooked\"\r\nthe cocaine, packaged it, and distributed it to customers, making\r\na profit of $2,500 to $5,000 for every kilogram sold.  Smith's\r\ngroup therefore relied on Owens's group for a steady supply of\r\ncocaine, and Owens's group correspondingly depended on Smith's\r\ngroup for cash.  The two groups collaborated on drug deals in other\r\nmeaningful ways.  Owens was often accompanied by members of both\r\ngroups as he traveled to Florida and New York to purchase cocaine;\r\nand on at least one occasion, Smith and Owens jointly contributed\r\n$100,000 to finance a drug buying trip to Florida, which was made\r\nby Owens and Lewis.\r\nOwens's and Smith's groups also relied on one another as\r\nthey resorted to violence to protect their drug interests.  On two\r\noccasions, when Owens's New York source provided cocaine that Owens\r\ndeemed unacceptable, Owens and Smith, accompanied by other gang\r\nmembers, drove to New York to obtain redress.  On one of these\r\ntrips, the men were armed with guns provided by Owens.  The first\r\ntrip was a success as Owens and Smith, at gunpoint, extracted a\r\nrefund from the source.  The second \"refund\" trip was unsuccessful. \r\nOn yet another occasion, when Rodney Belle's cohorts stole cocaine\r\nfrom Owens during a drug deal, Owens turned to Smith and Lewis for\r\nhelp, directing Smith to determine who was responsible for the\r\ntheft.  When Smith and Allen learned that Belle was responsible,\r\nSmith told Lewis to set up a meeting with Belle, purportedly to\r\npurchase guns.  During the meeting, Owens, assisted by Lewis,\r\nStephens, and Lowe, killed Belle.\r\nC.  Discussion\r\nOwens contends that the evidence suggested two separate\r\nand autonomous enterprises, one directed by Owens and the other\r\ndirected by Smith.  He points to testimony that Smith received less\r\nthan half of his cocaine from Owens and did not know all of Owens's\r\nbuyers.  According to Owens, the government therefore failed to\r\nestablish the existence of the enterprise charged in the\r\nindictment.  We disagree.     \r\nThe term \"enterprise\" in the RICO statute includes \"any\r\nindividual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal\r\nentity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact\r\nalthough not a legal entity.\"  18 U.S.C.  1961(c).  An\r\n\"association in fact\" type of enterprise can consist of two illegal\r\nentities.  Cf. United States v. London, 66 F.3d 1227, 1243 (1st\r\nCir. 1995) (holding that \"two or more legal entities can form or be\r\npart of an association-in-fact RICO enterprise\") (emphasis in\r\noriginal); United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 585 (1981)\r\n(holding that RICO applies to wholly illegal enterprises).  To\r\nprove an enterprise, the government must introduce \"evidence of an\r\nongoing organization, formal or informal, and . . . evidence that\r\nthe various associates function as a continuing unit.\"  Id. at 583. \r\nWhere two sub-groups are at issue, \"what is necessary is evidence\r\nof systemic linkage, such as overlapping leadership, structural or\r\nfinancial ties, or continuing coordination.\"  Libertad v. Welch, 53\r\nF.3d 428, 443 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nHere, the government introduced sufficient evidence of\r\nsystemic linkages between Owens's and Smith's organizations. \r\nMembers of the two groups depended on one another both financially\r\nand structurally.  They regularly exchanged money for cocaine,\r\ncoordinated in the transporting of cocaine to Boston, accompanied\r\none another on cocaine buying trips, and assisted one another in\r\nacts of violence to protect their drug interests.  Based on this\r\nevidence, a reasonable jury could have found, beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt, the existence of the enterprise charged in the indictment. \r\nCompare Libertad, 53 F.3d at 443-44 (two organizations constituted\r\none RICO enterprise when one organization issued a press release\r\nreferring to second organization as \"affiliated group;\" leaders of\r\nsecond organization \"shared information\" with first organization on\r\na regular basis; and both organizations participated in one protest\r\ntogether); with United States v. Bledsoe, 674 F.2d 647, 667 (8th\r\nCir. 1982) (no enterprise where evidence showed two separate\r\nassociations of individuals, with no common personnel, except one\r\ndefendant who was a member of both organizations at different\r\ntimes).\r\nThat Smith received less than half of his cocaine from\r\nOwens and did not know all of Owens's buyers does not detract from\r\nthe existence of the enterprise because RICO does not \"demand total\r\nfusion or that all defendants participate in all racketeering\r\nactivities, know of the entire conspiratorial sweep, or be\r\nacquainted with all other defendants.\"  Libertad, 53 F.3d at 445\r\n(citation omitted) (discussing RICO conspiracy count). \r\nAccordingly, the government sufficiently proved the existence of an\r\nenterprise.\r\nOwens's related argument, that the evidence was\r\ninsufficient to show that he conducted or participated in the\r\naffairs of the enterprise, also fails because, as discussed supra,\r\nthe evidence more than sufficiently established that Owens\r\nconducted and participated in the affairs of the enterprise.\r\n        IV.  Adequacy of the Jury Instructions\r\nOwens challenges the adequacy of the district court's\r\njury instructions in three respects.  He claims that the court\r\nerred by: (1) failing to honor a promise to defense counsel\r\nregarding jury instructions on the elements of a violation under 18\r\nU.S.C.  1962(c) (conduct and participation in RICO enterprise),\r\nand disregarding Supreme Court precedent on the proper\r\ninterpretation of the statute; (2) giving an improper instruction\r\non the proof necessary to show a pattern of racketeering activity;\r\nand (3) incorrectly instructing the jury on the elements of proof\r\nfor 18 U.S.C.  1956(a) (money laundering).  We discuss each\r\nargument in turn.\r\nA.  Conduct and Participation in Enterprise\r\n\nOwens's first argument stems from his interpretation of\r\n18 U.S.C.  1962(c) and Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 507 U.S. 170, 183\r\n(1993).  Section 1962(c) provides that it shall be unlawful for a\r\nperson \"to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the\r\nconduct\" of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of\r\nracketeering activity.  18 U.S.C.  1962(c) (emphasis added).  The\r\nindictment against Owens charged him with, inter alia, controlling,\r\nheading, and directing a RICO enterprise, rather than simply\r\nconducting or participating in the enterprise.  Defense counsel\r\nhighlighted this fact during the charge conference and,\r\naccordingly, requested the district court to instruct the jury that\r\na conviction under 18 U.S.C.  1962(c) must be premised on a\r\nfinding that Owens \"directed\" the enterprise and not on a finding\r\nthat he merely \"conducted or participated\" in the affairs of such\r\nenterprise.  The government objected, arguing that directing the\r\nenterprise is not an element of the offense.  The district court\r\noffered a compromise to which both parties assented:\r\nI think I can tie the government to the\r\nindictment but nevertheless properly frame the\r\nelements if I add in the concept lower down in\r\nthe paragraph: A person may be found to\r\nparticipate in the conduct of the enterprise\r\neven though he has no part in the management\r\nor control of the enterprise.  But here, the\r\ngovernment has charged, and it must prove,\r\nwhatever language I find there in the\r\nindictment.\r\n\nWhen the court instructed the jury with respect to this\r\nissue, it began by stating that\r\n[w]hen you come to evaluate the evidence with\r\nrespect to those things that I tell you must\r\nbe proved beyond a reasonable doubt, you can\r\ncheck against the indictment to see what [the\r\ngovernment] ha[s] specifically charged.  The\r\ncase has to be proved in the manner that it\r\nwas indicted.  That's the charge that they\r\nhave made.\r\n\nBut then, after giving additional instructions covering fourteen\r\npages of the transcript, the court advised the jury that\r\n[t]he third [RICO] element is the requirement\r\nthat the evidence demonstrate beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt that [Owens] conducted or\r\nparticipated in the conduct of the\r\nenterprise's affairs by engaging in a pattern\r\nof racketeering activity.  The term conduct\r\nand participate in the conduct of an\r\nenterprise includes the performance of acts,\r\nfunctions or duties which are related to the\r\n[operation] of the enterprise.  A person may\r\nbe found to participate in the conduct of the\r\nenterprise even though he has no part in the\r\nmanagement or control of the enterprise.\r\n(emphasis added).  Owens objected to this instruction and requested\r\nthat the district court instruct the jury in accordance with what\r\nit said at the charge conference, i.e., that the government must\r\nprove Owens had some role in directing the affairs of the\r\nenterprise.  The district court declined to alter its instruction. \r\nOwens argues that the court's failure to instruct as he\r\nrequested constitutes reversible error under Fed. R. Crim. P. 30. \r\nIn relevant part, Rule 30 provides:\r\nAt the close of the evidence or at such\r\nearlier time during the trial as the court\r\nreasonably directs, any party may file written\r\nrequests that the court instruct the jury on\r\nthe law as set forth in the requests . . . .\r\nThe court shall inform counsel of its proposed\r\naction upon the requests prior to their\r\narguments to the jury.\r\nWhen a court fails to honor the dictates of Rule 30, reversal is\r\nwarranted if defense counsel's closing argument was prejudicially\r\naffected.  See United States v. Porter, 764 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir.\r\n1985). \r\nIt is a close question whether the district court\r\nviolated Rule 30.  The court did, after all, tell the jury that the\r\ncase must be \"proved in the manner that it was indicted.\" \r\nNonetheless, by first telling the jury that it must look to the\r\nindictment and then, quite a bit later, instructing it on the\r\nelements of 18 U.S.C.  1962(c), the court may well have left the\r\njury with the impression that Owens need not have directed the\r\nenterprise.  But assuming that the court's actions violated Rule\r\n30, Owens has not explained how defense counsel's closing arguments\r\nwere prejudiced.\r\nTo show prejudice, Owens must establish that he \"was\r\nunfairly prevented from arguing [his] defense to the jury or was\r\nsubstantially misled in formulating and presenting arguments.\" \r\nUnited States v. Foppe, 993 F.2d 1444, 1451 (9th Cir. 1993)\r\n(quoting United States v. Gaskins, 849 F.2d 454, 458 (9th Cir.\r\n1988)).  Here, Owens has neither specified a defense theory the\r\ncourt's promise led him to forego, nor explained how his closing\r\narguments would have differed had the court instructed in precise\r\naccordance with his request.  Nor is it obvious to us what Owens's\r\ncounsel otherwise might have done.  Hence, the Rule 30 violation,\r\nif any, led to no apparent prejudice.  \r\nOwens's next argument, that the court's instructions on\r\nthe 18 U.S.C.  1962(c) offense were in conflict with Reves, also\r\nfails.  Reves addressed the question whether \"one must participate\r\nin the operation or management of the enterprise itself to be\r\nsubject to liability under [18 U.S.C.  1962(c)].\"  507 U.S. at\r\n183.  The Supreme Court has answered this question by holding that\r\na party outside a RICO enterprise is only liable if he or she\r\nparticipates in the operation or management of the enterprise.  Seeid. at 179.  Reves's analysis does not apply where a party is\r\ndetermined to be inside a RICO enterprise.  See United States v.\r\nHoulihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1298-99 (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 117\r\nS. Ct. 963 (1997); United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 68 (1st\r\nCir. 1995); United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1995),\r\ncert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105 (1996); United States v. Oreto, 37 F.3d\r\n739, 751 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nThere is no question that Owens was an insider to the\r\nRICO enterprise.  Owens supplied Smith with one to two kilograms of\r\ncocaine per week, and the two groups acted in concert with one\r\nanother on several occasions to facilitate their joint interests\r\n(e.g., murdering Rodney Belle).  Because Owens was not an outside\r\ncontractor to the RICO enterprise, Reves is inapposite.  The\r\ncourt's instruction accorded with circuit precedent. \r\nB.  Proof Necessary to Show a \"Pattern of Racketeering\r\nActivity\"\r\nOwens also argues that the district court incorrectly\r\ninstructed the jury on the proof necessary to show a \"pattern of\r\nracketeering activity\" under 18 U.S.C.  1962(c).  The district\r\ncourt instructed that, to establish a \"pattern of racketeering\r\nactivity\" under RICO, the government must prove that Owens's\r\nracketeering acts \"are related or that they amount to or pose a\r\nthreat of continued criminal activity.\"  Owens argues, and the\r\ngovernment concedes, that Supreme Court precedent requires proof\r\nthat the racketeering acts are related and that they amount to or\r\npose a threat of continued criminal activity.  See H.J. Inc. v.\r\nNorthwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239 (1989).  Owens\r\ntherefore correctly asserts that the disjunctive should have been\r\nconjunctive.\r\nOwens, however, failed to object to this instruction in\r\nthe district court, and we therefore review only for plain error\r\nunder Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).  See Johnson v. United States, 520\r\nU.S. 461, 466 (1997); United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734\r\n(1993).  For Rule 52(b) to apply, an error or defect raised for the\r\nfirst time on appeal must be \"plain,\" meaning \"clear\" or \"obvious,\"\r\nand it must have \"affect[ed] substantial rights,\" meaning, in most\r\ncases, \"[i]t must have affected the outcome of the district court\r\nproceedings.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 734.  Even then, error correction\r\nunder Rule 52(b) is entirely discretionary, and should be exercised\r\nonly when an error \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or\r\npublic reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Id. at 736. \r\nMoreover, the Supreme Court has made it clear that where\r\nthe government sets forth essentially uncontroverted evidence that\r\noverwhelmingly supports a conviction, the conviction should stand\r\nunless the defendant makes a plausible argument that the\r\ninstructional error affected the verdict.  See Johnson, 520 U.S. at\r\n466.  At trial, the government presented evidence that\r\noverwhelmingly demonstrated Owens's involvement in large-scale drug\r\ntrafficking and with associated violence from 1988 to the time of\r\nhis arrest in 1995.  Moreover, the evidence all but compelled the\r\nconclusion that Owens would have continued to engage in such\r\nactivities had the police not intervened by arresting him and\r\nending the enterprise.  Thus, there is a wealth of evidence to\r\nsupport the conclusion that Owens's racketeering acts were related\r\nand posed a threat of continued criminal activity (i.e., \"pattern\r\nof racketeering\").  We therefore decline to find plain error under\r\nRule 52(b). \r\nC.  Money Laundering\r\nFinally, Owens argues that the court's instructions\r\nimproperly relieved the government of proving an essential element\r\nof the money laundering offense because it erroneously instructed\r\nthe jury that it was not necessary to find that his financial\r\ntransactions (i.e., drug sales) actually affected interstate\r\ncommerce in order to convict him under 18 U.S.C.  1956(a) (money\r\nlaundering).\r\nTo prove the offense of money laundering, the government\r\nmust show, inter alia, that the defendant engaged in a financial\r\ntransaction that affected interstate commerce.  See 18 U.S.C.\r\n1956(c)(4).  A minimal effect on interstate commerce is\r\nsufficient to support a conviction.  See United States v. Juvenile\r\nMale, 118 F.3d 1344, 1349 (9th Cir. 1997).  If, however, there is\r\nno effect on interstate commerce, conviction is not proper.  SeeUnited States v. Grey, 56 F.3d 1219, 1225 (10th Cir. 1995).\r\nThe district court's instruction to the jury was, in\r\nrelevant part, as follows:\r\n               Now, it's not necessary for the government to\r\n               show that Mr. Owens actually intended or\r\n               anticipated an effect on interstate commerce\r\n               or even that interstate commerce was actually\r\n               affected.  What is necessary is that it be the\r\n               natural and probable consequence of his\r\n               actions to affect interstate commerce, no\r\n               matter how minimally.   \r\n\n     (emphasis added).  The government contends that this instruction\r\ndid not constitute reversible error because, as a whole, the\r\ninstructions made clear that the financial transactions at issue\r\nmust have had at least a minimal effect on interstate commerce.\r\nWe have some difficulty with the government's position. \r\nThe express language of the instruction informed the jury that it\r\nwas not necessary to find that Owens's financial transactions\r\naffected interstate commerce to convict him of money laundering\r\nunder 18 U.S.C.  1956(a).  Thus, the instructions were reasonably\r\nlikely to have understated the government's burden of proof.\r\nAgain, however, Owens failed to object to the district\r\ncourt's instruction.  Thus, once again we review for plain error. \r\nSee Johnson, 520 U.S. at 466; Olano, 507 U.S. at 734.  And again,\r\nthe error does not warrant recognition under Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n52(b).\r\nUnderlying the charge for money laundering was the\r\nallegation that Owens used proceeds generated from his drug sales\r\nto purchase Be Be's Barbecue.  The government introduced evidence\r\nthat overwhelmingly established that the money for Be Be's was\r\ngenerated as members of the enterprise transported cocaine from\r\nProvidence to Boston, sold the cocaine, and returned to Providence\r\nwith the revenue.  These transactions occurred on a weekly basis. \r\nThus, by finding Owens guilty of money laundering, the jury\r\nnecessarily found that Owens's activities had an effect on\r\ninterstate commerce.  Cf. Russell v. United States, 471 U.S. 858,\r\n862 (1985) (stating that the rental of real estate is\r\nunquestionably an activity that affects interstate commerce);\r\nUnited States v. Westbrook, 119 F.3d 1176, 1192 (5th Cir. 1997)\r\n(purchase of two cars with proceeds of a cocaine sale affects\r\ninterstate commerce), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 1059 (1998); United\r\nStates v. Gallo, 927 F.2d 815, 822-23 (5th Cir. 1991)\r\n(transportation on interstate highway of drug trafficking proceeds\r\naffects interstate commerce).  \r\n                V.  Additional Claims\r\nOwens makes a number of additional claims on appeal, none\r\nof which merits more than brief mention.  First, Owens argues that\r\nthe district court abused its discretion in accepting co-defendant\r\nJohnny Stephens's guilty plea after, rather than before, delivering\r\nits preliminary instructions to the jury.  We see no such error. \r\nCf. United States v. Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 1993)\r\n(no error when district court accepted co-defendant's guilty plea\r\nafter government completed presentation of its case); United Statesv. Del Carmen Ramirez, 823 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1987) (no error when\r\ndistrict court accepted co-defendants' guilty pleas during second\r\nday of trial).\r\nSecond, we also reject Owens's fall-back argument that\r\nthe district court's jury instructions with respect to Stephens's\r\nsudden absence did more harm than good by highlighting this absence\r\nand thereby suggesting that Stephens had pleaded guilty.  The\r\ndistrict court instructed:\r\nYou will note . . . that Mr. Stephens and his\r\nattorneys are no longer present, and in fact,\r\nyou are not going to be asked anything about\r\nthose charges.  That is no longer part of this\r\ncase.  You don't speculate about that, don't\r\nspeculate about that in any way.  The case now\r\nis the case of the government, Mr. Dwayne\r\nOwens and only Mr. Dwayne Owens.  You're just\r\nnot going to be asked about Mr. Stephens.  \r\nThese instructions are almost identical to jury instructions that\r\nhave been approved by this court in similar circumstances. \r\nSee Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d at 32; Del Carmen Ramirez, 823 F.2d at 3. \r\nMoreover, our system of trial by jury is premised on the assumption\r\nthat jurors will scrupulously follow the court's instructions, seeRichardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206 (1987); United States v.\r\nRivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 999 (1st Cir. 1995), and we therefore \r\nassume that the jury, upon hearing the court's instructions,\r\nrefrained from speculating about Stephens's absence from the court.\r\nThird, we reject Owens's claim that the district court\r\nabused its discretion in failing to hold a post-judgment hearing\r\nregarding possible jury taint after a defense investigator reported\r\nthat she overheard one juror tell another: \"It's a good thing you\r\nremembered about Johnny Stephens.\"  Owens claims that this\r\nstatement suggested the juror had been exposed to publicity during\r\nthe trial.  We disagree.  The trial was replete with testimony\r\nconcerning Stephens's involvement in the RICO enterprise as well as\r\nevidence concerning Owens's use of \"Johnny Stephens\" as an alias. \r\nThe juror comment certainly was as likely related to these issues\r\nas it was indicative of jury taint.  Indeed, the court asked the\r\njury throughout trial whether it had been exposed to publicity\r\nabout the trial, and the jury consistently denied any such\r\nexposure.  Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the\r\ndistrict court's refusal to hold a post-judgment evidentiary\r\nhearing was an abuse of discretion.\r\nFourth, the district court did not, as Owens asserts, err\r\nin refusing to excuse a juror for cause when that juror initially\r\nexpressed doubt about her ability to fairly consider the evidence,\r\nbut ultimately stated that she would try to do so.  \"There are few\r\naspects of a jury trial where we would be less inclined to disturb\r\na trial judge's exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, than in\r\nruling on challenges for cause in the empaneling of a jury.\" \r\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Soberal, 109 F.3d 64, 69-70 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).  We see no clear abuse in the court's refusal to dismiss the\r\njuror.\r\nFinally, the district court did not, as Owens contends,\r\nerr in refusing to define reasonable doubt in its instructions to\r\nthe jury.  It is well established that courts are not required to\r\ndefine the concept of reasonable doubt.  See Victor v. Nebraska,\r\n511 U.S. 1, 5 (1994) (\"[T]he Constitution neither prohibits trial\r\ncourts from defining reasonable doubt nor requires them to do so as\r\na matter of course.\"); United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1303\r\n(1st Cir. 1994) (\"This circuit has repeatedly refused to require\r\nthe district courts to define 'reasonable doubt' in their\r\ninstructions to the jury.\") (citing cases).  Nor did the court\r\nimpermissibly dilute the reasonable doubt standard with the\r\ninstructions it did provide the jury. \r\n                   VI.  Conclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm Dwayne Owens's\r\nconvictions in all respects.\r\nAffirmed.\n",

In this appeal, Owens challenges his convictions on various grounds.  After a careful review of the record and Owens's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Prior Proceedings and Appellate Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1996, a grand jury returned a twenty-seven count indictment against Owens and others.  Underlying this indictment was the government's allegation that, from 1988 to 1995, Owens ran a large-scale drug enterprise that obtained cocaine from suppliers in New York and Florida for distribution in Massachusetts.  The government also accused Owens of possessing numerous handguns, resorting to violence and threats of violence to protect his drug interests, and of the murder of one Rodney Belle, who had double-crossed him in a drug deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Owens moved to suppress the fruits of a search of his home at 26 Parsons Avenue in East Providence, Rhode Island and a search of an automobile in which he was a passenger, conducted on an interstate highway in Memphis, Tennessee.  In addition, he requested a hearing pursuant to Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978) (holding that the Fourth Amendment entitles a defendant to a hearing if he establishes a prima facie case that a search warrant affidavit included knowingly or recklessly false statements).  Although the district court denied Owens's request for a Franks hearing, it did conduct a six-day evidentiary hearing on the motions to suppress, concluding that most of the objected to evidence was properly seized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the case was submitted to the jury, Owens was the sole remaining defendant.  He was convicted on all charges pertaining to the murder of Rodney Belle, conspiracy to murder Rodney Belle, violations of the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization (\"RICO\") Act, RICO conspiracy, interstate travel in aid of RICO, conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine, using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, being a fugitive from justice in possession of a firearm, and money laundering.  The jury acquitted him on a number of other charges.  The district court sentenced Owens to life imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Owens makes a number of arguments which fall into three main categories.  First, he challenges the district court's denial of his motions to suppress.  Second, he argues that there was insufficient evidence to support his RICO convictions.  Finally, he contends that the court delivered a number of flawed jury instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discuss each issue in turn after setting forth in context the relevant underlying facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. The Suppression Motions</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's factual findings for clear error.  See United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522, 525 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1093, 117 S.Ct. 771, 136 L.Ed.2d 717 (1997).  Where specific findings are lacking, we view the record in the light most favorable to the ruling, drawing all reasonable inferences in support of the challenged ruling.  See id. at 529.   We review a district court's legal conclusions de novo.  See United States v. Carty, 993 F.2d 1005, 1008 (1st Cir.1993).  In the end, we defer to a district court's denial of a suppression motion, so long as it is supported by any reasonable view of the evidence.  See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. 26 Parsons Avenue Search</p>\n    <p>1. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1995, Boston police notified East Providence police that a man known as Don Miley, alias Dwayne Owens,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was wanted for homicide in Boston, and that an accomplice of this man was cooperating with the police.  This accomplice gave Boston police information about the suspect's drug trafficking activities and described his residence in East Providence.  On May 18, 1995, East Providence Police Captain Joseph Broadmeadow submitted an affidavit in support of an application for a warrant to search Owens's home at 26 Parsons Avenue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The warrant was granted and authorized police to search for \"a black male, age 32, known as Don Miley, alias Dwayne Owens, alias [sic] with a date of birth of 6-9-63, also firearms, ammunition.\"   The police executed the warrant on May 19, during Owens's absence from the residence, and seized extensive evidence including not only guns, ammunition, illegal drugs, and drug paraphernalia, but also personal documents, some of which were found in manila folders and envelopes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's motion to suppress the fruits of this search argued (1) that the warrant application failed to establish probable cause and the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply;  and (2) that the police exceeded the scope of their search.  As an adjunct to his suppression motion, he also moved for a Franks hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted in part and denied in part Owens's suppression motion, ruling that the warrant application established probable cause to search for firearms and ammunition, and that even if probable cause to search did not support the warrant, most of the items seized were admissible under the \"good-faith exception\" recognized in United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984) (holding that evidence seized in reasonable good-faith reliance on a search warrant, which is later found defective, may be admitted at trial).  As to the scope of the search, the court determined that certain evidence was properly seized because it was in plain view and immediately apparent as evidence of a crime or as evidence that would help lead to the apprehension of Owens, whom the officers reasonably believed was a fugitive.  Although the court granted Owens's motion with respect to some items seized during the search, ruling that these documents were not immediately apparent as relevant evidence, in the end, it admitted most of the seized items, including the drugs, drug paraphernalia, and certain personal documents.  The court denied Owens's request for a Franks hearing, finding that Owens failed to make a substantial preliminary showing that Officer Broadmeadow's affidavit contained any deliberately false or recklessly false statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Owens renews the two arguments made in his motion to suppress.  He also contends that the district court improperly denied his request for a Franks hearing.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p>a. Probable Cause and Leon 's Good-Faith Exception</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that the warrant for 26 Parsons Avenue was not supported by probable cause, we agree with the district court that the executing officers reasonably relied in good faith on a facially valid warrant.  We therefore need not assess the constitutionality of the warrant and simply hold that the district court committed no error in denying the motion to suppress.  See Leon, 468 U.S. at 925, 104 S.Ct. 3405 (courts have discretion to consider the issue of officers' good faith without first addressing Fourth Amendment issue).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are four exclusions to the Leon good-faith exception:  (1) \"when the magistrate ... was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard for the truth;\" (2) \"where the issuing magistrate wholly abandoned his [detached and neutral] judicial role;\" (3) where the affidavit is \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable;\" and (4) where a warrant is \"so facially deficient--i.e. in failing to particularize the place to be searched or the things to be seized--that the executing officers cannot reasonably presume it to be valid.\"  Id. at 923, 104 S.Ct. 3405.   Owens contends that the 26 Parsons Avenue search implicates the first and fourth exclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p>i. False Information in Affidavit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Owens, the affidavit improperly misled the magistrate in three respects.  First, it claimed that the Boston police had a murder warrant for Don Miley when in fact the murder warrant identified the suspect only as Dwayne Owens.  Second, it misstated that business records indicated Be Be's Barbecue was \"owned and incorporated by Don Miley\" when Don Miley was only listed in corporate documents as Vice President.  And third, its statement that phone number 436-6658 was located at 26 Parsons Avenue improperly omitted that the number listed was in the name of Johnny Stephens, not Don Miley.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's claims fail because he cannot establish that these misstatements were either knowingly false or reckless.  At most, Broadmeadow's errors resulted from negligence, and \"[a]llegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient.\"  Franks, 438 U.S. at 171, 98 S.Ct. 2674.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, even if any of the misstatements were knowingly false or reckless, we do not see how they were material.  See United States v. Vanness, 85 F.3d 661, 662-63 (D.C.Cir.1996) (warrant valid under Leon because false statement not material).  The affidavit's statement that a warrant existed for \"Miley,\" rather than \"Owens,\" was immaterial because the affidavit also indicated that the subject known as \"Miley\" used the alias \"Owens.\"   Nor can the statement that Miley was named in business records as owner rather than Vice President be characterized as material because, in either event, the suspect was linked to Be Be's Barbecue.  Cf. State v. Groff, 323 N.W.2d 204, 210 (Iowa 1982) (stating that defendant \"owns\" land on which marijuana is growing, rather than that \"he farms the land,\" is not materially false).  Finally, the affidavit's failure to recite that telephone number 436-6658 was listed in the name of Johnny Stephens was not material under the circumstances.  Police questioning of the landlord of 26 Parsons Avenue had already established that a man known as Miley was living at that address.  It was immaterial whether Miley was living there alone or with others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>ii. Facially Deficient Warrant</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Owens, it was unreasonable for the executing officers to rely on a warrant that he characterizes as so facially deficient as to be \"bare bones.\"   In particular, Owens complains that the affidavit demonstrated neither the recency of the information relied upon nor a nexus between the firearms and 26 Parsons Avenue.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Owens's complaints, the affidavit was sufficiently current because it stated that an \"active warrant\" existed for Owens, that an informant \"is cooperating\" (emphasis added) with Boston police, and that the informant described a Cole Street address as \"being used\" (emphasis added) by Owens in his drug business.  From this, the executing officers could reasonably have inferred that the informant's data were recent and described an ongoing drug operation and access to firearms.  Cf. United States v. Zayas-Diaz, 95 F.3d 105, 111 (1st Cir.1996) (affidavit not stale because references by informant were in the present tense and therefore implied regular ongoing transactions);  United States v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 568 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[I]t is common ground that drug conspiracies tend to be ongoing operations, rendering timely information that might, in other contexts, be regarded as stale.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's complaint that the affidavit failed to establish any nexus between the firearms and 26 Parsons Avenue similarly fails.  The affidavit recited that Owens was wanted for murder, had \"numerous firearms,\" and rented a house at 26 Parsons Avenue.  Based on this information, it was reasonable for the executing officers to believe that firearms would be found at 26 Parsons Avenue.  Cf. United States v. Procopio, 88 F.3d 21, 28 (1st Cir.)  (nexus between evidence of crime and address to be searched sufficiently established where affidavit recited that suspect lived at that address), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1046, 117 S.Ct. 620, 136 L.Ed.2d 543 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p>b. The Scope of the Search</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens concedes that if the police were lawfully present at 26 Parsons Avenue, as we have just concluded, then the firearms and ammunition were properly seized within the scope of the search warrant, and the drugs and paraphernalia were properly seized pursuant to the plain view doctrine.  He contends, however, that the police officers exceeded the proper scope of the search when they seized various personal documents which were not in plain view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plain view seizure is lawful if (1) the seizing officer has a prior justification for being in a position to see the item in plain view and (2) the evidentiary value of the item is immediately apparent.  See Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 136, 110 S.Ct. 2301, 110 L.Ed.2d 112 (1990).  According to Owens, the officers improperly seized various personal documents because the evidentiary value of these documents was not \"immediately apparent.\"   In particular, Owens contests the seizure of the following documents, which were introduced as evidence at trial:  address books, telephone bills, papers containing names and numbers, money order receipts, documents regarding gun purchases by Andrea Frith Jones, a photograph of himself with a pile of money, and a birth certificate for Donald Miley.  Together, these documents helped the government establish that Owens had engaged in years of drug trafficking;  had access to and used guns in connection with his drug enterprise;  had access to large amounts of money;  and used an alias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's argument that the seizure of these items exceeded the scope of the authorized search is not without force.  But, assuming arguendo that the seizure of various documents was unlawful, the admission of such evidence at trial was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Milton v. Wainwright, 407 U.S. 371, 372-73, 92 S.Ct. 2174, 33 L.Ed.2d 1 (1972) (stating that where the jury, in addition to hearing erroneously admitted testimony, is \"presented with overwhelming evidence of petitioner's guilt,\" error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).  The seized documents merely corroborated the damaging and voluminous testimony which the government introduced at trial.  Four participants in the enterprise testified that Owens and his colleagues engaged in years of drug trafficking.  Eight witnesses variously testified that they had purchased weapons for Owens;  Owens carried a weapon with him almost all the time;  Owens was seen with weapons on various occasions;  and Owens kept numerous weapons in his apartment.  Five witnesses testified that they had seen Owens with large amounts of cash on a number of occasions.  And finally, the testimony of three witnesses amply established that Owens used the alias Don Miley.  In admitting the documents, the district court's error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>c. Franks Hearing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens also contends that the court improperly denied his motion for a Franks hearing.  As we have stated, under Franks, a defendant may overcome the presumption that a warrant affidavit is valid by making a \"substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit.\"  438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. 2674.   For the reasons discussed supra at Part II-B-2-a-i, we see no clear error in the district court's determination that Owens failed to make a substantial preliminary showing that the affidavit contained knowingly false or reckless statements.  See United States v. Parcels of Land, 903 F.2d 36, 46 (1st Cir.1990) (a district court's determination that the requisite showing for a Franks hearing is reviewed for clear error).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, we affirm the district court's denial of Owens's motion for a Franks hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Tennessee Automobile Stop</p>\n    <p>1. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 13, 1995, Patrolman Andy Boyd of the Shelby County Sheriff's Office stopped a Black Ford Thunderbird for speeding on a highway in Memphis, Tennessee.  Owens was a passenger in that car.  Boyd asked the driver, Devone Robinson, for his driver's license, and Robinson responded that he did not have his license with him.  Boyd then asked Robinson to step out of the Thunderbird and into the patrol car so that he could do a license check.  Robinson complied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Boyd separately questioned Robinson and Owens, and received conflicting responses from both men.  For instance, when Boyd asked Robinson where he was from, Robinson responded that he lived in North Carolina, even though he had earlier stated that he was from Massachusetts and Virginia.  In response to Boyd's request for Owens's name, Owens responded \"Robert.\"   Robinson, however, stated that his passenger was named \"Jay.\"  The two also gave conflicting accounts of who owned the car.  Robinson first stated that it belonged to Jay, then later stated that it belonged to Jay's friend.  Owens, meanwhile, provided police with a vehicle registration showing the owner to be Kenneth Allen, whom Owens identified as his brother-in-law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These contradicting statements having raised his suspicions, Boyd requested assistance, and Sergeant Mark Kellerhall arrived shortly on the scene.  The officers then called for a drug dog, which had to be transported from the airport at the other side of the city.  They also initiated a vehicle registration check, criminal history checks, and a National Crime Information Center (\"NCIC\") check to determine whether the car was stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About fourteen minutes into the stop,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Robinson admitted that his Virginia driver's license had been suspended, a fact that the police radio channel confirmed five minutes later.  Boyd then arrested Robinson for driving without a license.  Normal procedure for the Shelby County Sheriff's Office dictates that when the driver-owner of a car is arrested, he is asked to sign a form authorizing the car's release to a passenger.  In this case, however, the registered owner was not present, and the police continued to receive conflicting responses from the driver and the passenger regarding ownership of the car.  After his arrest, Robinson changed his earlier position and stated, while pointing to Owens, that the car belonged to \"Kenny.\"   Under these circumstances, the officers elected to await the results of the vehicle registration check and other inquiries to determine whether Owens had actual authority to drive the car.  They did so even after a computer check revealed that the license provided by Owens, alias Davis, was valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 29 minutes into the stop, the officers received the results of the criminal history checks, which indicated that Robinson had a cocaine possession charge, and that the registered owner, Kenneth Allen, had two cocaine trafficking charges and an armed robbery charge.  The officers also received the results of the NCIC check, indicating that the vehicle had not been reported stolen.  Boyd nonetheless waited for the results of the vehicle registration check rather than permit Owens to drive away because he believed that stolen cars did not always appear on the NCIC database.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 49-50 minutes into the stop, while the officers were still waiting for the results of the vehicle registration check, the canine unit arrived.  The police had the drug dog, Torque, conduct a sniff test on the outside of the vehicle.  Torque alerted to the car, indicating the presence of drugs.  The officers thereupon searched the car and found, in a secret compartment, a loaded .40 caliber Ruger, a .380 Cobray Uzi, ammunition for the Uzi, over $16,000 in cash, and several address and ledger books.  The police seized all the objects in the compartment.  The government introduced this evidence at trial.  Subsequent clinical tests on the car revealed no drugs and no drug residue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens moved to suppress the evidence seized in this search, arguing:  (1) the length of the investigative stop made the stop an unlawful detention;  (2) the drug dog was unreliable, so the officers lacked probable cause to search the car for contraband;  and (3) even if the search was, at bottom, lawful, the officers exceeded its scope in seizing the address books and ledgers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Owens's motion.  The court found that Officer Boyd had properly stopped the Thunderbird for speeding and arrested Robinson for driving without a license.  The court also ruled that the officers were justified in detaining the Thunderbird during the time they investigated whether Owens had actual authority to drive the car.  In evaluating the propriety of the dog sniff, the court reasoned that exposing the outside of the car to a dog sniff did not implicate the Fourth Amendment, and once the dog alerted to the car, the officers had probable cause to search the interior.  Rejecting Owens's argument that the officers exceeded the lawful scope of their search, the court held that the search was appropriate as to all items seized from the secret compartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens contends that the district court erred in denying his motion, and renews on appeal the arguments presented in his motion to suppress.  Again, we disagree with Owens's contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>a. The Length of the Stop</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating the propriety of the Tennessee stop, we apply a two-prong test.  First, we must determine whether the \"officer[s'] actions were justified at [their] inception,\" and if so, \"whether the actions undertaken by the officer[s] following the stop were reasonably responsive to the circumstances justifying the stop in the first place as augmented by information gleaned by the officer[s] during the stop.\"  United States v. Sowers, 136 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 119 S.Ct. 105, 142 L.Ed.2d 84 (1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens does not challenge the initial automobile stop for speeding as invalid under Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968).  See Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 439, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984) (\"[T]he usual traffic stop is more analogous to a so called 'Terry stop' ... than to a formal arrest.\").  Rather, he contends that the fifty-minute detention was too long in duration to be justified as an investigative stop.  Thus, his argument hinges on whether the length of the detention converted the otherwise valid investigative stop into a de facto arrest for which probable cause was lacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reasonableness inquiry is almost always fact specific.  See United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1994) (noting that \"[t]here is no scientifically precise formula that enables courts to distinguish between valid investigatory stops and de facto arrests\").  The Supreme Court has directed courts making this inquiry to examine</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p>whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time it was necessary to detain the defendant.  A court making this assessment should take care to consider whether the police are acting in a swiftly developing situation, and in such cases the court should not indulge in unrealistic second-guessing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 686, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fifty-minute detention was indeed a lengthy one, and in other circumstances would perhaps weigh in favor of finding a de facto arrest.  A long duration, however, does not by itself transform an otherwise valid stop into an arrest.  See McCarthy, 77 F.3d at 530 (stating that \"there is no talismanic time beyond which any stop initially justified on the basis of Terry becomes an unreasonable seizure under the [F]ourth [A]mendment\") (citation omitted).  Here, the period of detention was justified.  The officers necessarily spent the first twenty minutes trying to ascertain whether Robinson had a valid driver's license, which he did not.  It was only after arresting Robinson that the officers faced the problem of whether to permit Owens to drive a car that he did not own.  Moreover, events unfolded in such a manner as to raise the officers' suspicions regarding Owens's authority to drive the car:  Robinson and Owens gave conflicting stories about who owned the car and Owens was evasive and avoided eye-contact during police questioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In responding to the circumstances, the officers diligently pursued a means of investigation that would dispel their suspicions.  They initiated a number of computer checks on the car and its occupants and reasonably awaited the results.  Cf. United States v. Morales-Zamora, 914 F.2d 200, 203 (10th Cir.1990) (holding that detention of defendants' vehicles was reasonable during time that officers completed inspections of defendants' documents);  United States v. Walker, 933 F.2d 812, 816 n. 2 (10th Cir.1991) (suggesting in dicta that length of detention would have been reasonable if police were waiting for results of an NCIC, license, or registration inquiry).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these particular facts, the detention was not a de facto arrest and the district court's finding that the officers responded reasonably to the circumstances as they developed is supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p>b. Reliability of Drug Dog</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The existence of probable cause based on an alert by a drug dog depends upon the dog's reliability.  See United States v. Race, 529 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir.1976).  During the suppression hearing, Owens and the government introduced conflicting evidence regarding Torque's reliability.  Owens offered the testimony of Dr. Dan Craig, an expert on animal behavior, who, after reviewing records of Torque's failure to pass two certification tests as well as his training and performance, concluded that Torque was not reliable in vehicle searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced the testimony of Mark Robertson, the training supervisor for the Shelby County Sheriff's drug interdiction team, who offered explanations for Torque's failure in the certification tests.  Robertson claimed responsibility for Torque's first failure, stating that he had prematurely entered the then newly trained dog in a national test against top dogs.  He attributed Torque's second failure to handler error.  He also emphasized that Torque was certified at the time of the Tennessee stop.  In the end, Robertson testified that Torque was an extremely reliable dog, and that Torque and his handler were among the best.  Torque's handler, Carrole Owen, also testified for the government, and opined that Torque's reliability was excellent.  The district court ultimately credited the government's testimony and determined that Torque was sufficiently reliable to support a finding of probable cause.  With due deference to the district court's greater ability to gauge the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses, we cannot say that the court's finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>c. Seizure of Address Books</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Owens asserts that even if the police officers had probable cause to search the car, they wrongly seized address books and notebooks, which were outside the scope of the plain view doctrine because their incriminating nature was not immediately apparent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's arguments are misplaced:  officers who have probable cause to search a car for contraband are not limited in the scope of their search by the plain view doctrine.  See United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 800, 102 S.Ct. 2157, 72 L.Ed.2d 572 (1982).  Rather, \"[i]f probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.\"  Id. at 825, 102 S.Ct. 2157.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the officers had probable cause to believe that the automobile contained drugs and evidence of drug trafficking.  The address books and notebooks were concealed in a secret compartment, together with a large amount of cash, two guns, and ostensibly a residue of drugs.  Under these circumstances, the police had probable cause to believe that the address books and notebooks were evidence of drug trafficking and thus properly seized them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens argues that his RICO convictions must be set aside because the government offered insufficient proof of the \"enterprise\" charged in the indictment and of Owens's participation in that enterprise.  In considering Owens's sufficiency claims, we must \"view the evidence, together with all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom, in the light most favorable to the government, ... [and consider] whether a rational trier of fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  United States v. Loder, 23 F.3d 586, 589 (1st Cir.1994) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  After examining the evidence under this standard, we reject Owens's arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Background Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment charged Owens and one Keillen Smith with being leaders of an enterprise, consisting of individuals \"associated in fact,\" which operated from 1988 to 1995 and engaged in drug trafficking and acts of violence, including murder.  The alleged purpose of the enterprise included \"enriching members through drug trafficking and drug distribution;\" \"preserving, protecting and expanding the power and control of the enterprise through the use of murder, violence, threats of violence, and intimidation;\" and \"promoting and enhancing the enterprise and its members' drug trafficking and related activities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During trial, the government introduced evidence that Owens and Smith were the major players in an organization, made up of two sub-groups, that supplied cocaine to the Boston area.  Owens, assisted by Johnny Stephens, Robert Owens, and Coleman Essex, was in charge of supplying the organization with cocaine.  Smith, assisted by Kenneth Allen, Anthony Lewis, Charles Brown, Wayne Meadows, and Gordon Lowe, was responsible for packaging and distributing the cocaine in the Boston area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens first began selling cocaine to Smith in ounce quantities in 1987.  By 1990, Smith had become a large-scale distributor for Owens, purchasing and reselling cocaine by the kilogram.  Owens continued to sell cocaine to Smith even after Owens left Boston and began to move from state to state in order to avoid arrest.  In early 1991, Owens relocated to Providence, Rhode Island, where he continued his drug trafficking activities until his arrest in 1995.  While in Providence, Owens sold cocaine to Smith on a near weekly basis for $20,000 to $25,000 a kilogram.  Although Smith sometimes personally collected the drugs from Owens, he usually had Lewis, Brown, or Meadows travel to Rhode Island from Massachusetts to pick up kilogram quantities.  The men would return with the drugs in Owens's Thunderbird, which Owens had outfitted with hidden compartments.  In Boston, Smith and his group \"cooked\" the cocaine, packaged it, and distributed it to customers, making a profit of $2,500 to $5,000 for every kilogram sold.  Smith's group therefore relied on Owens's group for a steady supply of cocaine, and Owens's group correspondingly depended on Smith's group for cash.  The two groups collaborated on drug deals in other meaningful ways.  Owens was often accompanied by members of both groups as he traveled to Florida and New York to purchase cocaine;  and on at least one occasion, Smith and Owens jointly contributed $100,000 to finance a drug buying trip to Florida, which was made by Owens and Lewis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's and Smith's groups also relied on one another as they resorted to violence to protect their drug interests.  On two occasions, when Owens's New York source provided cocaine that Owens deemed unacceptable, Owens and Smith, accompanied by other gang members, drove to New York to obtain redress.  On one of these trips, the men were armed with guns provided by Owens.  The first trip was a success as Owens and Smith, at gunpoint, extracted a refund from the source.  The second \"refund\" trip was unsuccessful.  On yet another occasion, when Rodney Belle's cohorts stole cocaine from Owens during a drug deal, Owens turned to Smith and Lewis for help, directing Smith to determine who was responsible for the theft.  When Smith and Allen learned that Belle was responsible, Smith told Lewis to set up a meeting with Belle, purportedly to purchase guns.  During the meeting, Owens, assisted by Lewis, Stephens, and Lowe, killed Belle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens contends that the evidence suggested two separate and autonomous enterprises, one directed by Owens and the other directed by Smith.  He points to testimony that Smith received less than half of his cocaine from Owens and did not know all of Owens's buyers.  According to Owens, the government therefore failed to establish the existence of the enterprise charged in the indictment.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"enterprise\" in the RICO statute includes \"any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(c).  An \"association in fact\" type of enterprise can consist of two illegal entities.  Cf. United States v. London, 66 F.3d 1227, 1243 (1st Cir.1995) (holding that \"two or more legal entities can form or be part of an association-in-fact RICO enterprise\") (emphasis in original);  United States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 585, 101 S.Ct. 2524, 69 L.Ed.2d 246 (1981) (holding that RICO applies to wholly illegal enterprises).  To prove an enterprise, the government must introduce \"evidence of an ongoing organization, formal or informal, and ... evidence that the various associates function as a continuing unit.\"  Id. at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524.   Where two sub-groups are at issue, \"what is necessary is evidence of systemic linkage, such as overlapping leadership, structural or financial ties, or continuing coordination.\"  Libertad v. Welch, 53 F.3d 428, 443 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the government introduced sufficient evidence of systemic linkages between Owens's and Smith's organizations.  Members of the two groups depended on one another both financially and structurally.  They regularly exchanged money for cocaine, coordinated in the transporting of cocaine to Boston, accompanied one another on cocaine buying trips, and assisted one another in acts of violence to protect their drug interests.  Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of the enterprise charged in the indictment.  Compare Libertad, 53 F.3d at 443-44 (two organizations constituted one RICO enterprise when one organization issued a press release referring to second organization as \"affiliated group;\" leaders of second organization \"shared information\" with first organization on a regular basis;  and both organizations participated in one protest together);  with United States v. Bledsoe, 674 F.2d 647, 667 (8th Cir.1982) (no enterprise where evidence showed two separate associations of individuals, with no common personnel, except one defendant who was a member of both organizations at different times).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That Smith received less than half of his cocaine from Owens and did not know all of Owens's buyers does not detract from the existence of the enterprise because RICO does not \"demand total fusion or that all defendants participate in all racketeering activities, know of the entire conspiratorial sweep, or be acquainted with all other defendants.\"  Libertad, 53 F.3d at 445 (citation omitted) (discussing RICO conspiracy count).  Accordingly, the government sufficiently proved the existence of an enterprise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's related argument, that the evidence was insufficient to show that he conducted or participated in the affairs of the enterprise, also fails because, as discussed supra, the evidence more than sufficiently established that Owens conducted and participated in the affairs of the enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. Adequacy of the Jury Instructions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens challenges the adequacy of the district court's jury instructions in three respects.  He claims that the court erred by:  (1) failing to honor a promise to defense counsel regarding jury instructions on the elements of a violation under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) (conduct and participation in RICO enterprise), and disregarding Supreme Court precedent on the proper interpretation of the statute;  (2) giving an improper instruction on the proof necessary to show a pattern of racketeering activity;  and (3) incorrectly instructing the jury on the elements of proof for 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a) (money laundering).  We discuss each argument in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Conduct and Participation in Enterprise</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's first argument stems from his interpretation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) and Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, 507 U.S. 170, 183, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993).  Section 1962(c) provides that it shall be unlawful for a person \"to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct\" of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) (emphasis added).  The indictment against Owens charged him with, inter alia, controlling, heading, and directing a RICO enterprise, rather than simply conducting or participating in the enterprise.  Defense counsel highlighted this fact during the charge conference and, accordingly, requested the district court to instruct the jury that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) must be premised on a finding that Owens \"directed\" the enterprise and not on a finding that he merely \"conducted or participated\" in the affairs of such enterprise.  The government objected, arguing that directing the enterprise is not an element of the offense.  The district court offered a compromise to which both parties assented:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>I think I can tie the government to the indictment but nevertheless properly frame the elements if I add in the concept lower down in the paragraph:  A person may be found to participate in the conduct of the enterprise even though he has no part in the management or control of the enterprise.  But here, the government has charged, and it must prove, whatever language I find there in the indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the court instructed the jury with respect to this issue, it began by stating that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p>[w]hen you come to evaluate the evidence with respect to those things that I tell you must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, you can check against the indictment to see what [the government] ha[s] specifically charged.  The case has to be proved in the manner that it was indicted.  That's the charge that they have made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But then, after giving additional instructions covering fourteen pages of the transcript, the court advised the jury that</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>[t]he third [RICO] element is the requirement that the evidence demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that [Owens] conducted or participated in the conduct of the enterprise's affairs by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity.  The term conduct and participate in the conduct of an enterprise includes the performance of acts, functions or duties which are related to the [operation] of the enterprise.  A person may be found to participate in the conduct of the enterprise even though he has no part in the management or control of the enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).  Owens objected to this instruction and requested that the district court instruct the jury in accordance with what it said at the charge conference, i.e., that the government must prove Owens had some role in directing the affairs of the enterprise.  The district court declined to alter its instruction.  Owens argues that the court's failure to instruct as he requested constitutes reversible error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.  In relevant part, Rule 30 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during the trial as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests....  The court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior to their arguments to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a court fails to honor the dictates of Rule 30, reversal is warranted if defense counsel's closing argument was prejudicially affected.  See United States v. Porter, 764 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a close question whether the district court violated Rule 30.  The court did, after all, tell the jury that the case must be \"proved in the manner that it was indicted.\"   Nonetheless, by first telling the jury that it must look to the indictment and then, quite a bit later, instructing it on the elements of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c), the court may well have left the jury with the impression that Owens need not have directed the enterprise.  But assuming that the court's actions violated Rule 30, Owens has not explained how defense counsel's closing arguments were prejudiced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To show prejudice, Owens must establish that he \"was unfairly prevented from arguing [his] defense to the jury or was substantially misled in formulating and presenting arguments.\"  United States v. Foppe, 993 F.2d 1444, 1451 (9th Cir.1993) (quoting United States v. Gaskins, 849 F.2d 454, 458 (9th Cir.1988)).  Here, Owens has neither specified a defense theory the court's promise led him to forego, nor explained how his closing arguments would have differed had the court instructed in precise accordance with his request.  Nor is it obvious to us what Owens's counsel otherwise might have done.  Hence, the Rule 30 violation, if any, led to no apparent prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's next argument, that the court's instructions on the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) offense were in conflict with Reves, also fails.  Reves addressed the question whether \"one must participate in the operation or management of the enterprise itself to be subject to liability under [18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) ].\"  507 U.S. at 183, 113 S.Ct. 1163.   The Supreme Court has answered this question by holding that a party outside a RICO enterprise is only liable if he or she participates in the operation or management of the enterprise. See id. at 179, 113 S.Ct. 1163.  Reves 's analysis does not apply where a party is determined to be inside a RICO enterprise.  See United States v. Houlihan, 92 F.3d 1271, 1298-99 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1118, 117 S.Ct. 963, 136 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997);  United States v. Gabriele, 63 F.3d 61, 68 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Hurley, 63 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105, 116 S.Ct. 1322, 134 L.Ed.2d 474 (1996);  United States v. Oreto, 37 F.3d 739, 751 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no question that Owens was an insider to the RICO enterprise.  Owens supplied Smith with one to two kilograms of cocaine per week, and the two groups acted in concert with one another on several occasions to facilitate their joint interests (e.g., murdering Rodney Belle).  Because Owens was not an outside contractor to the RICO enterprise, Reves is inapposite.  The court's instruction accorded with circuit precedent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Proof Necessary to Show a \"Pattern of Racketeering Activity\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens also argues that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on the proof necessary to show a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c).  The district court instructed that, to establish a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" under RICO, the government must prove that Owens's racketeering acts \"are related or that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.\"   Owens argues, and the government concedes, that Supreme Court precedent requires proof that the racketeering acts are related and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.  See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Telephone Co., 492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989).  Owens therefore correctly asserts that the disjunctive should have been conjunctive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens, however, failed to object to this instruction in the district court, and we therefore review only for plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997);  United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).  For Rule 52(b) to apply, an error or defect raised for the first time on appeal must be \"plain,\" meaning \"clear\" or \"obvious,\" and it must have \"affect[ed] substantial rights,\" meaning, in most cases, \"[i]t must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\"  Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770.   Even then, error correction under Rule 52(b) is entirely discretionary, and should be exercised only when an error \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"  Id. at 736, 113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Supreme Court has made it clear that where the government sets forth essentially uncontroverted evidence that overwhelmingly supports a conviction, the conviction should stand unless the defendant makes a plausible argument that the instructional error affected the verdict.  See Johnson, 520 U.S. at 466, 117 S.Ct. 1544.   At trial, the government presented evidence that overwhelmingly demonstrated Owens's involvement in large-scale drug trafficking and with associated violence from 1988 to the time of his arrest in 1995.  Moreover, the evidence all but compelled the conclusion that Owens would have continued to engage in such activities had the police not intervened by arresting him and ending the enterprise.  Thus, there is a wealth of evidence to support the conclusion that Owens's racketeering acts were related and posed a threat of continued criminal activity (i.e., \"pattern of racketeering\").  We therefore decline to find plain error under Rule 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Money Laundering</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Owens argues that the court's instructions improperly relieved the government of proving an essential element of the money laundering offense because it erroneously instructed the jury that it was not necessary to find that his financial transactions (i.e., drug sales) actually affected interstate commerce in order to convict him under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a) (money laundering).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the offense of money laundering, the government must show, inter alia, that the defendant engaged in a financial transaction that affected interstate commerce.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(4).  A minimal effect on interstate commerce is sufficient to support a conviction.  See United States v. Juvenile Male, 118 F.3d 1344, 1349 (9th Cir.1997).  If, however, there is no effect on interstate commerce, conviction is not proper.  See United States v. Grey, 56 F.3d 1219, 1225 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's instruction to the jury was, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>Now, it's not necessary for the government to show that Mr. Owens actually intended or anticipated an effect on interstate commerce or even that interstate commerce was actually affected.   What is necessary is that it be the natural and probable consequence of his actions to affect interstate commerce, no matter how minimally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).  The government contends that this instruction did not constitute reversible error because, as a whole, the instructions made clear that the financial transactions at issue must have had at least a minimal effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have some difficulty with the government's position.  The express language of the instruction informed the jury that it was not necessary to find that Owens's financial transactions affected interstate commerce to convict him of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a).  Thus, the instructions were reasonably likely to have understated the government's burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, however, Owens failed to object to the district court's instruction.  Thus, once again we review for plain error.  See Johnson, 520 U.S. at 466, 117 S.Ct. 1544;  Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770.   And again, the error does not warrant recognition under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Underlying the charge for money laundering was the allegation that Owens used proceeds generated from his drug sales to purchase Be Be's Barbecue.  The government introduced evidence that overwhelmingly established that the money for Be Be's was generated as members of the enterprise transported cocaine from Providence to Boston, sold the cocaine, and returned to Providence with the revenue.  These transactions occurred on a weekly basis.  Thus, by finding Owens guilty of money laundering, the jury necessarily found that Owens's activities had an effect on interstate commerce.  Cf. Russell v. United States, 471 U.S. 858, 862, 105 S.Ct. 2455, 85 L.Ed.2d 829 (1985) (stating that the rental of real estate is unquestionably an activity that affects interstate commerce);  United States v. Westbrook, 119 F.3d 1176, 1192 (5th Cir.1997) (purchase of two cars with proceeds of a cocaine sale affects interstate commerce), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 118 S.Ct. 1059, 140 L.Ed.2d 121 (1998);  United States v. Gallo, 927 F.2d 815, 822-23 (5th Cir.1991) (transportation on interstate highway of drug trafficking proceeds affects interstate commerce).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V. Additional Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens makes a number of additional claims on appeal, none of which merits more than brief mention.  First, Owens argues that the district court abused its discretion in accepting co-defendant Johnny Stephens's guilty plea after, rather than before, delivering its preliminary instructions to the jury.  We see no such error.  Cf. United States v. Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d 28, 32 (1st Cir.1993) (no error when district court accepted co-defendant's guilty plea after government completed presentation of its case);  United States v. Del Carmen Ramirez, 823 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1987) (no error when district court accepted co-defendants' guilty pleas during second day of trial).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we also reject Owens's fall-back argument that the district court's jury instructions with respect to Stephens's sudden absence did more harm than good by highlighting this absence and thereby suggesting that Stephens had pleaded guilty.  The district court instructed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>You will note ... that Mr. Stephens and his attorneys are no longer present, and in fact, you are not going to be asked anything about those charges.  That is no longer part of this case.  You don't speculate about that, don't speculate about that in any way.  The case now is the case of the government, Mr. Dwayne Owens and only Mr. Dwayne Owens.  You're just not going to be asked about Mr. Stephens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These instructions are almost identical to jury instructions that have been approved by this court in similar circumstances.  See Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d at 32;  Del Carmen Ramirez, 823 F.2d at 3. Moreover, our system of trial by jury is premised on the assumption that jurors will scrupulously follow the court's instructions, see Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987);  United States v. Rivera-Gomez, 67 F.3d 993, 999 (1st Cir.1995), and we therefore assume that the jury, upon hearing the court's instructions, refrained from speculating about Stephens's absence from the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, we reject Owens's claim that the district court abused its discretion in failing to hold a post-judgment hearing regarding possible jury taint after a defense investigator reported that she overheard one juror tell another:  \"It's a good thing you remembered about Johnny Stephens.\"   Owens claims that this statement suggested the juror had been exposed to publicity during the trial.  We disagree.  The trial was replete with testimony concerning Stephens's involvement in the RICO enterprise as well as evidence concerning Owens's use of \"Johnny Stephens\" as an alias.  The juror comment certainly was as likely related to these issues as it was indicative of jury taint.  Indeed, the court asked the jury throughout trial whether it had been exposed to publicity about the trial, and the jury consistently denied any such exposure.  Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court's refusal to hold a post-judgment evidentiary hearing was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the district court did not, as Owens asserts, err in refusing to excuse a juror for cause when that juror initially expressed doubt about her ability to fairly consider the evidence, but ultimately stated that she would try to do so.  \"There are few aspects of a jury trial where we would be less inclined to disturb a trial judge's exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, than in ruling on challenges for cause in the empaneling of a jury.\"  United States v. Gonzalez-Soberal, 109 F.3d 64, 69-70 (1st Cir.1997).  We see no clear abuse in the court's refusal to dismiss the juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court did not, as Owens contends, err in refusing to define reasonable doubt in its instructions to the jury.  It is well established that courts are not required to define the concept of reasonable doubt.  See Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1, 5, 114 S.Ct. 1239, 127 L.Ed.2d 583 (1994) (\"[T]he Constitution neither prohibits trial courts from defining reasonable doubt nor requires them to do so as a matter of course.\");  United States v. Whiting, 28 F.3d 1296, 1303 (1st Cir.1994) (\"This circuit has repeatedly refused to require the district courts to define 'reasonable doubt' in their instructions to the jury.\")  (citing cases).  Nor did the court impermissibly dilute the reasonable doubt standard with the instructions it did provide the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Dwayne Owens's convictions in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The subject's name was actually Dwayne Owens, alias Don Miley</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The affidavit stated in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>I have received information [from] Detective Harris, Boston Police Department of Homicide Unit that a subject known as Don Miley, alias Dwayne Owens, Date of Birth 6/9/63, described as a black male, 32 years old is wanted for homicide by Boston, Mass Police Department.  An active warrant for homicide currently exists for Don Miley....</p>\n        <p>....  Boston Mass Detective Harris told your affiant that an individual is cooperating with the Boston PD in the homicide investigation.  This individual was an active participant in several of the homicides.  Detective Harris told affiant that the cooperating individual described an area in ... East Providence ... in which Don Miley stored cocaine and operated a drug business....</p>\n        <p>Detective Harris also told affiant that the cooperating individual said Miley had a barbecue restaurant in the Providence area and was the owner/operator of this business.  Investigation determined that this restaurant is Be Be's Barbecue, Lockwood Street, Providence.  A check of business records indicates that Be Be's barbecue is owned and incorporated by Don Miley....  The telephone listed for Miley was 435-6658.  This telephone is located at 26 Parsons Ave., East Providence, Rhode Island[.]  26 Parsons Avenue is rented to Don Miley which was determined by contacting the owner of this property.</p>\n        <p>... The cooperating individual ... said that Miley has numerous firearms and access to teflon bullets.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Owens also contends that the affidavit's description of another house, the search of which is not at issue in this appeal, was not identical to the description included in another report written by Broadmeadow and therefore constitutes a false statement.  Owens, however, did not make this allegation in his motion to suppress, raising it for the first time in a motion to reconsider.  Owens does not appeal the district court's denial of his motion to reconsider.  Instead, he asks us to overturn the court's denial of his motion to suppress based on an allegation that was not presented in that motion.  We decline this invitation.  See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 9 n. 7 (1st Cir.1990) (issues not raised below are normally waived for purposes of appeal)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Owens argues that Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) requires us to review the district court decision de novo.   We disagree.  Ornelas holds that de novo review is appropriate for reasonable suspicion and probable cause determinations and does not apply in this case.  See id. at 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657.   In any event, we would affirm even under a de novo standard of review</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Boyd's patrol car was equipped with a video camera which recorded the time throughout the stop</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Owens makes two additional arguments regarding the existence of the enterprise, both of which we reject.  First, he claims that the evidence failed to establish the enterprise functioned as a \"continuing unit\" because \"the testimony showed constant changes in [Owens's] activity as he moved from Boston to Florida to Fall River to Providence.\"   The evidence belies Owens's position.  Except for a three or four month period when Owens lived in Florida, Owens sold cocaine to Smith on a regular basis over nearly a decade.  Moreover, the \"continuing unit\" prong of the enterprise was sufficiently established by evidence that Owens's and Smith's organizations \"operated as a symbiotic unit ... and ... existed for a common purpose:  the economic gain of [defendants].\"  London, 66 F.3d at 1244</p>\n        <p>Second, relying on language in Bledsoe, 674 F.2d at 665, Owens alleges that the evidence showed no \"ascertainable structure distinct from that inherent in the conduct of a pattern of racketeering.\"   This circuit has not adopted the Eighth Circuit's test for \"enterprise.\"   See London, 66 F.3d at 1244 (without expressly adopting Bledsoe, assuming arguendo that the Bledsoe standard would be met in that case).  But insofar as Owens complains that the evidence failed to establish an enterprise that is separate from the pattern of racketeering activity, he is wrong.  See Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583, 101 S.Ct. 2524 (stating that \"[w]hile the proof used to establish these separate elements may in particular cases coalesce ... the existence of an enterprise at all times remains a separate element which must be proved by the government\");  Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. v. P &amp; B Autobody, 43 F.3d 1546, 1557 (1st Cir.1994) (same).  The evidence sufficiently established more than a mere series of criminal acts;  and where, as here, \"a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a [criminal] course of conduct,\" an enterprise separate from the pattern of racketeering activity is sufficiently established.  United States v. Doherty, 867 F.2d 47, 68 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Owens contends that we should revisit First Circuit precedent interpreting the scope of Reves.   As a newly-constituted panel, we are precluded from doing so.  See, e.g., Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. P.R. Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Authority, 991 F.2d 935, 939 n. 3 (1st Cir.1993).  Owens may, of course, press this argument in a petition for rehearing en banc</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In his reply brief, Owens contends that he objected to the jury instruction.  He cites, out of context, a portion of the trial transcript in which his counsel stated,</p>\n        <p>with respect to the pattern of racketeering activity, I renew the request previously made, note our objection to the Court not including the requirement there must be evidence of continuity, either by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, predicate acts form a closed period of repeated conduct [sic].</p>\n        <p>Despite counsel's reference to the \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" it is clear that this statement, when read in proper context, actually refers to counsel's earlier request that the court instruct the jury that \"[t]he enterprise must have an ongoing ascertainable structure and it must function as a continuing unit,\" an instruction relevant to the proof of the existence of an enterprise.  Our careful review of the record indicates that Owens did not note his objection to the court's erroneous disjunctive in the pattern of racketeering instruction.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

In this appeal, Owens challenges his convictions on various grounds.  After a careful review of the record and Owens's arguments, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Prior Proceedings and Appellate Issues</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 14, 1996, a grand jury returned a twenty-seven count indictment against Owens and others.  Underlying this indictment was the government's allegation that, from 1988 to 1995, Owens ran a large-scale drug enterprise that obtained cocaine from suppliers in New York and Florida for distribution in Massachusetts.  The government also accused Owens of possessing numerous handguns, resorting to violence and threats of violence to protect his drug interests, and of the murder of one Rodney Belle, who had double-crossed him in a drug deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to trial, Owens moved to suppress the fruits of a search of his home at 26 Parsons Avenue in East Providence, Rhode Island and a search of an automobile in which he was a passenger, conducted on an interstate highway in Memphis, Tennessee.  In addition, he requested a hearing pursuant to Franks v. Delaware, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the district court denied Owens's request for a Franks hearing, it did conduct a six-day evidentiary hearing on the motions to suppress, concluding that most of the objected to evidence was properly seized.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the case was submitted to the jury, Owens was the sole remaining defendant.  He was convicted on all charges pertaining to the murder of Rodney Belle, conspiracy to murder Rodney Belle, violations of the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization (\"RICO\") Act, RICO conspiracy, interstate travel in aid of RICO, conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine, using and carrying a firearm during a crime of violence, being a fugitive from justice in possession of a firearm, and money laundering.  The jury acquitted him on a number of other charges.

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May 1995, Boston police notified East Providence police that a man known as Don Miley, alias Dwayne Owens,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was wanted for homicide in Boston, and that an accomplice of this man was cooperating with the police.  This accomplice gave Boston police information about the suspect's drug trafficking activities and described his residence in East Providence.  On May 18, 1995, East Providence Police Captain Joseph Broadmeadow submitted an affidavit in support of an application for a warrant to search Owens's home at 26 Parsons Avenue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The warrant was granted and authorized police to search for \"a black male, age 32, known as Don Miley, alias Dwayne Owens, alias [sic] with a date of birth of 6-9-63, also firearms, ammunition.\"   The police executed the warrant on May 19, during Owens's absence from the residence, and seized extensive evidence including not only guns, ammunition, illegal drugs, and drug paraphernalia, but also personal documents, some of which were found in manila folders and envelopes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's motion to suppress the fruits of this search argued (1) that the warrant application failed to establish probable cause and the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply;  and (2) that the police exceeded the scope of their search.  As an adjunct to his suppression motion, he also moved for a Franks hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted in part and denied in part Owens's suppression motion, ruling that the warrant application established probable cause to search for firearms and ammunition, and that even if probable cause to search did not support the warrant, most of the items seized were admissible under the \"good-faith exception\" recognized in United States v. Leon, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">897</span></a></span>, 922, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As to the scope of the search, the court determined that certain evidence was properly seized because it was in plain view and immediately apparent as evidence of a crime or as evidence that would help lead to the apprehension of Owens, whom the officers reasonably believed was a fugitive.  Although the court granted Owens's motion with respect to some items seized during the search, ruling that these documents were not immediately apparent as relevant evidence, in the end, it admitted most of the seized items, including the drugs, drug paraphernalia, and certain personal documents.  The court denied Owens's request for a Franks hearing, finding that Owens failed to make a substantial preliminary showing that Officer Broadmeadow's affidavit contained any deliberately false or recklessly false statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Owens renews the two arguments made in his motion to suppress.

We therefore need not assess the constitutionality of the warrant and simply hold that the district court committed no error in denying the motion to suppress.  See Leon, 468 U.S. at 925, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111262\"><a href=\"/opinion/111262/united-states-v-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

False Information in Affidavit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Owens, the affidavit improperly misled the magistrate in three respects.  First, it claimed that the Boston police had a murder warrant for Don Miley when in fact the murder warrant identified the suspect only as Dwayne Owens.  Second, it misstated that business records indicated Be Be's Barbecue was \"owned and incorporated by Don Miley\" when Don Miley was only listed in corporate documents as Vice President.  And third, its statement that phone number 436-6658 was located at 26 Parsons Avenue improperly omitted that the number listed was in the name of Johnny Stephens, not Don Miley.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's claims fail because he cannot establish that these misstatements were either knowingly false or reckless.  At most, Broadmeadow's errors resulted from negligence, and \"[a]llegations of negligence or innocent mistake are insufficient.\"  Franks, 438 U.S. at 171, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

See United States v. Vanness, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719586\"><a href=\"/opinion/719586/united-states-v-charles-lester-vanness/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">661</span></a></span>, 662-63 (D.C.Cir.1996) (warrant valid under Leon because false statement not material).  The affidavit's statement that a warrant existed for \"Miley,\" rather than \"Owens,\" was immaterial because the affidavit also indicated that the subject known as \"Miley\" used the alias \"Owens.\"   Nor can the statement that Miley was named in business records as owner rather than Vice President be characterized as material because, in either event, the suspect was linked to Be Be's Barbecue.  Cf. State v. Groff, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1856811\"><a href=\"/opinion/1856811/state-v-groff/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, 210 (Iowa 1982) (stating that defendant \"owns\" land on which marijuana is growing, rather than that \"he farms the land,\" is not materially false).  Finally, the affidavit's failure to recite that telephone number 436-6658 was listed in the name of Johnny Stephens was not material under the circumstances.  Police questioning of the landlord of 26 Parsons Avenue had already established that a man known as Miley was living at that address.  It was immaterial whether Miley was living there alone or with others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>ii. Facially Deficient Warrant</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Owens, it was unreasonable for the executing officers to rely on a warrant that he characterizes as so facially deficient as to be \"bare bones.\"   In particular, Owens complains that the affidavit demonstrated neither the recency of the information relied upon nor a nexus between the firearms and 26 Parsons Avenue.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite Owens's complaints, the affidavit was sufficiently current because it stated that an \"active warrant\" existed for Owens, that an informant \"is cooperating\" (emphasis added) with Boston police, and that the informant described a Cole Street address as \"being used\" (emphasis added) by Owens in his drug business.  From this, the executing officers could reasonably have inferred that the informant's data were recent and described an ongoing drug operation and access to firearms.  Cf. United States v. Zayas-Diaz, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196972\"><a href=\"/opinion/196972/united-states-v-zayas-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 111 (1st Cir.1996) (affidavit not stale because references by informant were in the present tense and therefore implied regular ongoing transactions);  United States v. Schaefer, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196839\"><a href=\"/opinion/196839/united-states-v-schaefer/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span>, 568 (1st Cir.1996) (\"[I]t is common ground that drug conspiracies tend to be ongoing operations, rendering timely information that might, in other contexts, be regarded as stale.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's complaint that the affidavit failed to establish any nexus between the firearms and 26 Parsons Avenue similarly fails.  The affidavit recited that Owens was wanted for murder, had \"numerous firearms,\" and rented a house at 26 Parsons Avenue.  Based on this information, it was reasonable for the executing officers to believe that firearms would be found at 26 Parsons Avenue.  Cf. United States v. Procopio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196856\"><a href=\"/opinion/196856/united-states-v-procopio/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.)

The Scope of the Search</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens concedes that if the police were lawfully present at 26 Parsons Avenue, as we have just concluded, then the firearms and ammunition were properly seized within the scope of the search warrant, and the drugs and paraphernalia were properly seized pursuant to the plain view doctrine.  He contends, however, that the police officers exceeded the proper scope of the search when they seized various personal documents which were not in plain view.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plain view seizure is lawful if (1) the seizing officer has a prior justification for being in a position to see the item in plain view and (2) the evidentiary value of the item is immediately apparent.  See Horton v. California, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112448\"><a href=\"/opinion/112448/horton-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 136, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112448\"><a href=\"/opinion/112448/horton-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span> (1990).  According to Owens, the officers improperly seized various personal documents because the evidentiary value of these documents was not \"immediately apparent.\"   In particular, Owens contests the seizure of the following documents, which were introduced as evidence at trial:  address books, telephone bills, papers containing names and numbers, money order receipts, documents regarding gun purchases by Andrea Frith Jones, a photograph of himself with a pile of money, and a birth certificate for Donald Miley.  Together, these documents helped the government establish that Owens had engaged in years of drug trafficking;  had access to and used guns in connection with his drug enterprise;  had access to large amounts of money;  and used an alias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's argument that the seizure of these items exceeded the scope of the authorized search is not without force.  But, assuming arguendo that the seizure of various documents was unlawful, the admission of such evidence at trial was harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt.  See Milton v. Wainwright, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108585\"><a href=\"/opinion/108585/milton-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 372-73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108585\"><a href=\"/opinion/108585/milton-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1972) (stating that where the jury, in addition to hearing erroneously admitted testimony, is \"presented with overwhelming evidence of petitioner's guilt,\" error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt).  The seized documents merely corroborated the damaging and voluminous testimony which the government introduced at trial.  Four participants in the enterprise testified that Owens and his colleagues engaged in years of drug trafficking.  Eight witnesses variously testified that they had purchased weapons for Owens;  Owens carried a weapon with him almost all the time;  Owens was seen with weapons on various occasions;  and Owens kept numerous weapons in his apartment.  Five witnesses testified that they had seen Owens with large amounts of cash on a number of occasions.  And finally, the testimony of three witnesses amply established that Owens used the alias Don Miley.  In admitting the documents, the district court's error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>c. Franks Hearing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens also contends that the court improperly denied his motion for a Franks hearing.  As we have stated, under Franks, a defendant may overcome the presumption that a warrant affidavit is valid by making a \"substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit.\"  438 U.S. at 155-56, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109925\"><a href=\"/opinion/109925/franks-v-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2674</span></a></span>.   For the reasons discussed supra at Part II-B-2-a-i, we see no clear error in the district court's determination that Owens failed to make a substantial preliminary showing that the affidavit contained knowingly false or reckless statements.  See United States v. Parcels of Land, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541731\"><a href=\"/opinion/541731/united-states-v-parcels-of-land-etc-appeal-of-lionel-laliberte/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 46 (1st Cir.1990) (a district court's determination that the requisite showing for a Franks hearing is reviewed for clear error).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Thus, we affirm the district court's denial of Owens's motion for a Franks hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Tennessee Automobile Stop</p>\n    <p>1. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 13, 1995, Patrolman Andy Boyd of the Shelby County Sheriff's Office stopped a Black Ford Thunderbird for speeding on a highway in Memphis, Tennessee.  Owens was a passenger in that car.  Boyd asked the driver, Devone Robinson, for his driver's license, and Robinson responded that he did not have his license with him.  Boyd then asked Robinson to step out of the Thunderbird and into the patrol car so that he could do a license check.  Robinson complied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, Boyd separately questioned Robinson and Owens, and received conflicting responses from both men.  For instance, when Boyd asked Robinson where he was from, Robinson responded that he lived in North Carolina, even though he had earlier stated that he was from Massachusetts and Virginia.  In response to Boyd's request for Owens's name, Owens responded \"Robert.\"   Robinson, however, stated that his passenger was named \"Jay.\"  The two also gave conflicting accounts of who owned the car.  Robinson first stated that it belonged to Jay, then later stated that it belonged to Jay's friend.  Owens, meanwhile, provided police with a vehicle registration showing the owner to be Kenneth Allen, whom Owens identified as his brother-in-law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These contradicting statements having raised his suspicions, Boyd requested assistance, and Sergeant Mark Kellerhall arrived shortly on the scene.  The officers then called for a drug dog, which had to be transported from the airport at the other side of the city.  They also initiated a vehicle registration check, criminal history checks, and a National Crime Information Center (\"NCIC\") check to determine whether the car was stolen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About fourteen minutes into the stop,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Robinson admitted that his Virginia driver's license had been suspended, a fact that the police radio channel confirmed five minutes later.  Boyd then arrested Robinson for driving without a license.  Normal procedure for the Shelby County Sheriff's Office dictates that when the driver-owner of a car is arrested, he is asked to sign a form authorizing the car's release to a passenger.  In this case, however, the registered owner was not present, and the police continued to receive conflicting responses from the driver and the passenger regarding ownership of the car.  After his arrest, Robinson changed his earlier position and stated, while pointing to Owens, that the car belonged to \"Kenny.\"   Under these circumstances, the officers elected to await the results of the vehicle registration check and other inquiries to determine whether Owens had actual authority to drive the car.  They did so even after a computer check revealed that the license provided by Owens, alias Davis, was valid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 29 minutes into the stop, the officers received the results of the criminal history checks, which indicated that Robinson had a cocaine possession charge, and that the registered owner, Kenneth Allen, had two cocaine trafficking charges and an armed robbery charge.  The officers also received the results of the NCIC check, indicating that the vehicle had not been reported stolen.  Boyd nonetheless waited for the results of the vehicle registration check rather than permit Owens to drive away because he believed that stolen cars did not always appear on the NCIC database.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">About 49-50 minutes into the stop, while the officers were still waiting for the results of the vehicle registration check, the canine unit arrived.  The police had the drug dog, Torque, conduct a sniff test on the outside of the vehicle.  Torque alerted to the car, indicating the presence of drugs.  The officers thereupon searched the car and found, in a secret compartment, a loaded .40 caliber Ruger, a .380 Cobray Uzi, ammunition for the Uzi, over $16,000 in cash, and several address and ledger books.  The police seized all the objects in the compartment.  The government introduced this evidence at trial.  Subsequent clinical tests on the car revealed no drugs and no drug residue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens moved to suppress the evidence seized in this search, arguing:  (1) the length of the investigative stop made the stop an unlawful detention;  (2) the drug dog was unreliable, so the officers lacked probable cause to search the car for contraband;  and (3) even if the search was, at bottom, lawful, the officers exceeded its scope in seizing the address books and ledgers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied Owens's motion.  The court found that Officer Boyd had properly stopped the Thunderbird for speeding and arrested Robinson for driving without a license.  The court also ruled that the officers were justified in detaining the Thunderbird during the time they investigated whether Owens had actual authority to drive the car.  In evaluating the propriety of the dog sniff, the court reasoned that exposing the outside of the car to a dog sniff did not implicate the Fourth Amendment, and once the dog alerted to the car, the officers had probable cause to search the interior.  Rejecting Owens's argument that the officers exceeded the lawful scope of their search, the court held that the search was appropriate as to all items seized from the secret compartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens contends that the district court erred in denying his motion, and renews on appeal the arguments presented in his motion to suppress.  Again, we disagree with Owens's contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>a.

Here, the period of detention was justified.  The officers necessarily spent the first twenty minutes trying to ascertain whether Robinson had a valid driver's license, which he did not.  It was only after arresting Robinson that the officers faced the problem of whether to permit Owens to drive a car that he did not own.  Moreover, events unfolded in such a manner as to raise the officers' suspicions regarding Owens's authority to drive the car:  Robinson and Owens gave conflicting stories about who owned the car and Owens was evasive and avoided eye-contact during police questioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In responding to the circumstances, the officers diligently pursued a means of investigation that would dispel their suspicions.

During the suppression hearing, Owens and the government introduced conflicting evidence regarding Torque's reliability.  Owens offered the testimony of Dr. Dan Craig, an expert on animal behavior, who, after reviewing records of Torque's failure to pass two certification tests as well as his training and performance, concluded that Torque was not reliable in vehicle searches.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced the testimony of Mark Robertson, the training supervisor for the Shelby County Sheriff's drug interdiction team, who offered explanations for Torque's failure in the certification tests.  Robertson claimed responsibility for Torque's first failure, stating that he had prematurely entered the then newly trained dog in a national test against top dogs.  He attributed Torque's second failure to handler error.  He also emphasized that Torque was certified at the time of the Tennessee stop.  In the end, Robertson testified that Torque was an extremely reliable dog, and that Torque and his handler were among the best.  Torque's handler, Carrole Owen, also testified for the government, and opined that Torque's reliability was excellent.  The district court ultimately credited the government's testimony and determined that Torque was sufficiently reliable to support a finding of probable cause.  With due deference to the district court's greater ability to gauge the demeanor and credibility of the witnesses, we cannot say that the court's finding was clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p>c.

Background Facts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment charged Owens and one Keillen Smith with being leaders of an enterprise, consisting of individuals \"associated in fact,\" which operated from 1988 to 1995 and engaged in drug trafficking and acts of violence, including murder.  The alleged purpose of the enterprise included \"enriching members through drug trafficking and drug distribution;\" \"preserving, protecting and expanding the power and control of the enterprise through the use of murder, violence, threats of violence, and intimidation;\" and \"promoting and enhancing the enterprise and its members' drug trafficking and related activities.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During trial, the government introduced evidence that Owens and Smith were the major players in an organization, made up of two sub-groups, that supplied cocaine to the Boston area.  Owens, assisted by Johnny Stephens, Robert Owens, and Coleman Essex, was in charge of supplying the organization with cocaine.  Smith, assisted by Kenneth Allen, Anthony Lewis, Charles Brown, Wayne Meadows, and Gordon Lowe, was responsible for packaging and distributing the cocaine in the Boston area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens first began selling cocaine to Smith in ounce quantities in 1987.  By 1990, Smith had become a large-scale distributor for Owens, purchasing and reselling cocaine by the kilogram.  Owens continued to sell cocaine to Smith even after Owens left Boston and began to move from state to state in order to avoid arrest.  In early 1991, Owens relocated to Providence, Rhode Island, where he continued his drug trafficking activities until his arrest in 1995.  While in Providence, Owens sold cocaine to Smith on a near weekly basis for $20,000 to $25,000 a kilogram.  Although Smith sometimes personally collected the drugs from Owens, he usually had Lewis, Brown, or Meadows travel to Rhode Island from Massachusetts to pick up kilogram quantities.  The men would return with the drugs in Owens's Thunderbird, which Owens had outfitted with hidden compartments.  In Boston, Smith and his group \"cooked\" the cocaine, packaged it, and distributed it to customers, making a profit of $2,500 to $5,000 for every kilogram sold.  Smith's group therefore relied on Owens's group for a steady supply of cocaine, and Owens's group correspondingly depended on Smith's group for cash.  The two groups collaborated on drug deals in other meaningful ways.  Owens was often accompanied by members of both groups as he traveled to Florida and New York to purchase cocaine;  and on at least one occasion, Smith and Owens jointly contributed $100,000 to finance a drug buying trip to Florida, which was made by Owens and Lewis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's and Smith's groups also relied on one another as they resorted to violence to protect their drug interests.  On two occasions, when Owens's New York source provided cocaine that Owens deemed unacceptable, Owens and Smith, accompanied by other gang members, drove to New York to obtain redress.  On one of these trips, the men were armed with guns provided by Owens.  The first trip was a success as Owens and Smith, at gunpoint, extracted a refund from the source.  The second \"refund\" trip was unsuccessful.  On yet another occasion, when Rodney Belle's cohorts stole cocaine from Owens during a drug deal, Owens turned to Smith and Lewis for help, directing Smith to determine who was responsible for the theft.  When Smith and Allen learned that Belle was responsible, Smith told Lewis to set up a meeting with Belle, purportedly to purchase guns.  During the meeting, Owens, assisted by Lewis, Stephens, and Lowe, killed Belle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens contends that the evidence suggested two separate and autonomous enterprises, one directed by Owens and the other directed by Smith.  He points to testimony that Smith received less than half of his cocaine from Owens and did not know all of Owens's buyers.  According to Owens, the government therefore failed to establish the existence of the enterprise charged in the indictment.  We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"enterprise\" in the RICO statute includes \"any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1961(c).

Members of the two groups depended on one another both financially and structurally.  They regularly exchanged money for cocaine, coordinated in the transporting of cocaine to Boston, accompanied one another on cocaine buying trips, and assisted one another in acts of violence to protect their drug interests.  Based on this evidence, a reasonable jury could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of the enterprise charged in the indictment.  Compare Libertad, 53 F.3d at 443-44 (two organizations constituted one RICO enterprise when one organization issued a press release referring to second organization as \"affiliated group;\" leaders of second organization \"shared information\" with first organization on a regular basis;  and both organizations participated in one protest together);  with United States v.

Section 1962(c) provides that it shall be unlawful for a person \"to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct\" of an enterprise's affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) (emphasis added).  The indictment against Owens charged him with, inter alia, controlling, heading, and directing a RICO enterprise, rather than simply conducting or participating in the enterprise.  Defense counsel highlighted this fact during the charge conference and, accordingly, requested the district court to instruct the jury that a conviction under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) must be premised on a finding that Owens \"directed\" the enterprise and not on a finding that he merely \"conducted or participated\" in the affairs of such enterprise.  The government objected, arguing that directing the enterprise is not an element of the offense.  The district court offered a compromise to which both parties assented:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>I think I can tie the government to the indictment but nevertheless properly frame the elements if I add in the concept lower down in the paragraph:  A person may be found to participate in the conduct of the enterprise even though he has no part in the management or control of the enterprise.

A person may be found to participate in the conduct of the enterprise even though he has no part in the management or control of the enterprise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).  Owens objected to this instruction and requested that the district court instruct the jury in accordance with what it said at the charge conference, i.e., that the government must prove Owens had some role in directing the affairs of the enterprise.  The district court declined to alter its instruction.  Owens argues that the court's failure to instruct as he requested constitutes reversible error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 30.  In relevant part, Rule 30 provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p>At the close of the evidence or at such earlier time during the trial as the court reasonably directs, any party may file written requests that the court instruct the jury on the law as set forth in the requests....

See United States v. Porter, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453326\"><a href=\"/opinion/453326/united-states-v-paul-c-porter-united-states-v-walter-g-baker-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is a close question whether the district court violated Rule 30.  The court did, after all, tell the jury that the case must be \"proved in the manner that it was indicted.\"   Nonetheless, by first telling the jury that it must look to the indictment and then, quite a bit later, instructing it on the elements of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c), the court may well have left the jury with the impression that Owens need not have directed the enterprise.  But assuming that the court's actions violated Rule 30, Owens has not explained how defense counsel's closing arguments were prejudiced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To show prejudice, Owens must establish that he \"was unfairly prevented from arguing [his] defense to the jury or was substantially misled in formulating and presenting arguments.\"  United States v.

Here, Owens has neither specified a defense theory the court's promise led him to forego, nor explained how his closing arguments would have differed had the court instructed in precise accordance with his request.  Nor is it obvious to us what Owens's counsel otherwise might have done.  Hence, the Rule 30 violation, if any, led to no apparent prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens's next argument, that the court's instructions on the 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1962(c) offense were in conflict with Reves, also fails.

Owens supplied Smith with one to two kilograms of cocaine per week, and the two groups acted in concert with one another on several occasions to facilitate their joint interests (e.g., murdering Rodney Belle).  Because Owens was not an outside contractor to the RICO enterprise, Reves is inapposite.

The district court instructed that, to establish a \"pattern of racketeering activity\" under RICO, the government must prove that Owens's racketeering acts \"are related or that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.\"   Owens argues, and the government concedes, that Supreme Court precedent requires proof that the racketeering acts are related and that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.

See Johnson, 520 U.S. at 466, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At trial, the government presented evidence that overwhelmingly demonstrated Owens's involvement in large-scale drug trafficking and with associated violence from 1988 to the time of his arrest in 1995.  Moreover, the evidence all but compelled the conclusion that Owens would have continued to engage in such activities had the police not intervened by arresting him and ending the enterprise.  Thus, there is a wealth of evidence to support the conclusion that Owens's racketeering acts were related and posed a threat of continued criminal activity (i.e., \"pattern of racketeering\").  We therefore decline to find plain error under Rule 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Money Laundering</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Owens argues that the court's instructions improperly relieved the government of proving an essential element of the money laundering offense because it erroneously instructed the jury that it was not necessary to find that his financial transactions (i.e., drug sales) actually affected interstate commerce in order to convict him under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a) (money laundering).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the offense of money laundering, the government must show, inter alia, that the defendant engaged in a financial transaction that affected interstate commerce.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(c)(4).  A minimal effect on interstate commerce is sufficient to support a conviction.  See United States v. Juvenile Male, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743640\"><a href=\"/opinion/743640/97-cal-daily-op-serv-5400-97-daily-journal-dar-8761-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1344</span></a></span>, 1349 (9th Cir.1997).  If, however, there is no effect on interstate commerce, conviction is not proper.  See United States v. Grey, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697371\"><a href=\"/opinion/697371/united-states-v-huey-p-grey-and-ann-p-grey/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></a></span>, 1225 (10th Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's instruction to the jury was, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p>Now, it's not necessary for the government to show that Mr. Owens actually intended or anticipated an effect on interstate commerce or even that interstate commerce was actually affected.   What is necessary is that it be the natural and probable consequence of his actions to affect interstate commerce, no matter how minimally.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).  The government contends that this instruction did not constitute reversible error because, as a whole, the instructions made clear that the financial transactions at issue must have had at least a minimal effect on interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have some difficulty with the government's position.  The express language of the instruction informed the jury that it was not necessary to find that Owens's financial transactions affected interstate commerce to convict him of money laundering under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a).  Thus, the instructions were reasonably likely to have understated the government's burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Again, however, Owens failed to object to the district court's instruction.  Thus, once again we review for plain error.  See Johnson, 520 U.S. at 466, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And again, the error does not warrant recognition under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Underlying the charge for money laundering was the allegation that Owens used proceeds generated from his drug sales to purchase Be Be's Barbecue.  The government introduced evidence that overwhelmingly established that the money for Be Be's was generated as members of the enterprise transported cocaine from Providence to Boston, sold the cocaine, and returned to Providence with the revenue.  These transactions occurred on a weekly basis.  Thus, by finding Owens guilty of money laundering, the jury necessarily found that Owens's activities had an effect on interstate commerce.  Cf.

Additional Claims</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Owens makes a number of additional claims on appeal, none of which merits more than brief mention.  First, Owens argues that the district court abused its discretion in accepting co-defendant Johnny Stephens's guilty plea after, rather than before, delivering its preliminary instructions to the jury.  We see no such error.  Cf. United States v. Chapdelaine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602833\"><a href=\"/opinion/602833/united-states-v-george-chapdelaine/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.1993) (no error when district court accepted co-defendant's guilty plea after government completed presentation of its case);  United States v.

The district court instructed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p>You will note ... that Mr. Stephens and his attorneys are no longer present, and in fact, you are not going to be asked anything about those charges.  That is no longer part of this case.  You don't speculate about that, don't speculate about that in any way.  The case now is the case of the government, Mr. Dwayne Owens and only Mr. Dwayne Owens.  You're just not going to be asked about Mr. Stephens.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These instructions are almost identical to jury instructions that have been approved by this court in similar circumstances.  See Chapdelaine, 989 F.2d at 32;  Del Carmen Ramirez, 823 F.2d at 3. Moreover, our system of trial by jury is premised on the assumption that jurors will scrupulously follow the court's instructions, see Richardson v.

We disagree.  The trial was replete with testimony concerning Stephens's involvement in the RICO enterprise as well as evidence concerning Owens's use of \"Johnny Stephens\" as an alias.  The juror comment certainly was as likely related to these issues as it was indicative of jury taint.  Indeed, the court asked the jury throughout trial whether it had been exposed to publicity about the trial, and the jury consistently denied any such exposure.  Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court's refusal to hold a post-judgment evidentiary hearing was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, the district court did not, as Owens asserts, err in refusing to excuse a juror for cause when that juror initially expressed doubt about her ability to fairly consider the evidence, but ultimately stated that she would try to do so.  \"There are few aspects of a jury trial where we would be less inclined to disturb a trial judge's exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, than in ruling on challenges for cause in the empaneling of a jury.\"  United States v. Gonzalez-Soberal, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197260\"><a href=\"/opinion/197260/united-states-v-gonzalez-soberal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 69-70 (1st Cir.1997).  We see no clear abuse in the court's refusal to dismiss the juror.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the district court did not, as Owens contends, err in refusing to define reasonable doubt in its instructions to the jury.  It is well established that courts are not required to define the concept of reasonable doubt.  See Victor v. Nebraska, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117831\"><a href=\"/opinion/117831/victor-v-nebraska/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117831\"><a href=\"/opinion/117831/victor-v-nebraska/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">583</span></a></span> (1994) (\"[T]he Constitution neither prohibits trial courts from defining reasonable doubt nor requires them to do so as a matter of course.\");  United States v.

Nor did the court impermissibly dilute the reasonable doubt standard with the instructions it did provide the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Dwayne Owens's convictions in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The subject's name was actually Dwayne Owens, alias Don Miley</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The affidavit stated in relevant part:</p>\n        <p>I have received information [from] Detective Harris, Boston Police Department of Homicide Unit that a subject known as Don Miley, alias Dwayne Owens, Date of Birth 6/9/63, described as a black male, 32 years old is wanted for homicide by Boston, Mass Police Department.  An active warrant for homicide currently exists for Don Miley....</p>\n        <p>....  Boston Mass Detective Harris told your affiant that an individual is cooperating with the Boston PD in the homicide investigation.  This individual was an active participant in several of the homicides.  Detective Harris told affiant that the cooperating individual described an area in ... East Providence ... in which Don Miley stored cocaine and operated a drug business....</p>\n        <p>Detective Harris also told affiant that the cooperating individual said Miley had a barbecue restaurant in the Providence area and was the owner/operator of this business.  Investigation determined that this restaurant is Be Be's Barbecue, Lockwood Street, Providence.  A check of business records indicates that Be Be's barbecue is owned and incorporated by Don Miley....  The telephone listed for Miley was 435-6658.  This telephone is located at 26 Parsons Ave., East Providence, Rhode Island[.]  26 Parsons Avenue is rented to Don Miley which was determined by contacting the owner of this property.</p>\n        <p>... The cooperating individual ... said that Miley has numerous firearms and access to teflon bullets.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Owens also contends that the affidavit's description of another house, the search of which is not at issue in this appeal, was not identical to the description included in another report written by Broadmeadow and therefore constitutes a false statement.  Owens, however, did not make this allegation in his motion to suppress, raising it for the first time in a motion to reconsider.  Owens does not appeal the district court's denial of his motion to reconsider.  Instead, he asks us to overturn the court's denial of his motion to suppress based on an allegation that was not presented in that motion.  We decline this invitation.  See United States v. Zannino, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 n. 7 (1st Cir.1990) (issues not raised below are normally waived for purposes of appeal)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Owens argues that Ornelas v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">911</span></a></span> (1996) requires us to review the district court decision de novo.   We disagree.  Ornelas holds that de novo review is appropriate for reasonable suspicion and probable cause determinations and does not apply in this case.  See id. at 699, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1657</span></a></span>.   In any event, we would affirm even under a de novo standard of review</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Boyd's patrol car was equipped with a video camera which recorded the time throughout the stop</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Owens makes two additional arguments regarding the existence of the enterprise, both of which we reject.  First, he claims that the evidence failed to establish the enterprise functioned as a \"continuing unit\" because \"the testimony showed constant changes in [Owens's] activity as he moved from Boston to Florida to Fall River to Providence.\"   The evidence belies Owens's position.  Except for a three or four month period when Owens lived in Florida, Owens sold cocaine to Smith on a regular basis over nearly a decade.  Moreover, the \"continuing unit\" prong of the enterprise was sufficiently established by evidence that Owens's and Smith's organizations \"operated as a symbiotic unit ... and ... existed for a common purpose:  the economic gain of [defendants].\"  London, 66 F.3d at 1244</p>\n        <p>Second, relying on language in Bledsoe, 674 F.2d at 665, Owens alleges that the evidence showed no \"ascertainable structure distinct from that inherent in the conduct of a pattern of racketeering.\"   This circuit has not adopted the Eighth Circuit's test for \"enterprise.\"   See London, 66 F.3d at 1244 (without expressly adopting Bledsoe, assuming arguendo that the Bledsoe standard would be met in that case).  But insofar as Owens complains that the evidence failed to establish an enterprise that is separate from the pattern of racketeering activity, he is wrong.  See Turkette, 452 U.S. at 583, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110529\"><a href=\"/opinion/110529/united-states-v-turkette/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2524</span></a></span> (stating that \"[w]hile the proof used to establish these separate elements may in particular cases coalesce ... the existence of an enterprise at all times remains a separate element which must be proved by the government\");  Aetna Cas. Sur. Co. v. P &amp; B Autobody, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686425\"><a href=\"/opinion/686425/aetna-casualty-surety-company-v-p-b-autobody-arsenal-auto-repairs/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1546</span></a></span>, 1557 (1st Cir.1994) (same).  The evidence sufficiently established more than a mere series of criminal acts;  and where, as here, \"a group of persons associated together for a common purpose of engaging in a [criminal] course of conduct,\" an enterprise separate from the pattern of racketeering activity is sufficiently established.  United States v. Doherty, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"518089\"><a href=\"/opinion/518089/united-states-v-thomas-k-doherty-united-states-of-america-v-nelson-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">867</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Owens contends that we should revisit First Circuit precedent interpreting the scope of Reves.   As a newly-constituted panel, we are precluded from doing so.  See, e.g., Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. v. P.R. Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Authority, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605529\"><a href=\"/opinion/605529/metcalf-eddy-inc-v-puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">991</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span>, 939 n. 3 (1st Cir.1993).  Owens may, of course, press this argument in a petition for rehearing en banc</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In his reply brief, Owens contends that he objected to the jury instruction.  He cites, out of context, a portion of the trial transcript in which his counsel stated,</p>\n        <p>with respect to the pattern of racketeering activity, I renew the request previously made, note our objection to the Court not including the requirement there must be evidence of continuity, either by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, predicate acts form a closed period of repeated conduct [sic].</p>\n        <p>Despite counsel's reference to the \"pattern of racketeering activity,\" it is clear that this statement, when read in proper context, actually refers to counsel's earlier request that the court instruct the jury that \"[t]he enterprise must have an ongoing ascertainable structure and it must function as a continuing unit,\" an instruction relevant to the proof of the existence of an enterprise.  Our careful review of the record indicates that Owens did not note his objection to the court's erroneous disjunctive in the pattern of racketeering instruction.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
