Upon careful review  of the record and\r                                \r\n\nthe parties'  briefs, we  conclude that summary  judgment for\r\n\nthe  defendant  was proper  for  the  reasons stated  by  the\r\n\ndistrict court.  We add only the following comments.\r\n\n          Defendant's  discovery responses do  not suggest to\r\n\nus any grounds for reversing the judgment here.\r\n\n          We cannot consider the  judgment entered in another\r\n\naction against other defendants, as that matter is not before\r\n\nus now.\r\n\n          We know  of no  basis for plaintiff's  request that\r\n\nthis case be transferred to state court. \r\n\n          Affirmed.
