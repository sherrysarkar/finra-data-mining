Pro  se  plaintiff  Robert  Bradley,  an\r                                        \r\n\nincarcerated  felon, appeals a  district court  judgment that\r\n\ndismissed    his    action    challenging     the    Veterans\r\n\nAdministration's decision to  reduce his disability  benefits\r\n\npursuant  to  38  U.S.C.      5513(a)(1)(requiring  temporary\r\n\nreduction of veterans' benefits paid to incarcerated felons).\r\n\nThe  district  court  dismissed Bradley's  complaint  on  the\r\n\ngrounds that  it lacked subject matter  jurisdiction under 38\r\n\nU.S.C.     511(a), 7252(a).   After thoroughly  reviewing the\r\n\nrecord and the  parties' briefs on  appeal, we conclude  that\r\n\nthe district court order is clearly correct.  \r\n\n     Bradley's  complaint  seeks   to  reverse  the  Veterans\r\n\nAdministration's decision to reduce his benefits based on his\r\n\nstatus  as an  incarcerated  felon.   The  district court  is\r\n\nprohibited from asserting jurisdiction over such claims by 38\r\n\nU.S.C.   511, and it is well established that Bradley may not\r\n\ncircumvent  this  prohibition  by   asserting  constitutional\r\n\nclaims.  See, e.g., Zuspann v. Brown, 60 F.3d 1156, 1159 (5th\r                                                \r\n\nCir.  1995), cert. denied, 116  S.

U.S. Veterans Administration, 884 F.2d 514, 515  (9th Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1989);  Milliken  v. Gleason,  332  F.2d 122,  123  (1st Cir.\r                                        \r\n\n                             -2-\r\r\n\n1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 1002 (1965).  Rather, Bradley's\r                               \r\n\nsole  remedy is  through  the procedures  established by  the\r\n\nVeterans Judicial Review Act, Pub. Law No. 100-687, 102 Stat.\r\n\n4105 (1988).  See Hall v. U.S. Dept. of Veterans  Affairs, 85\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 532, 535 (11th Cir. 1996)(per curiam).    \r\n\n     Bradley's contention  that 38  U.S.C.    511(a) violates\r\n\nArticle  III and  his  right  of  access  to  the  courts  is\r\n\nfrivolous.  See Marozsan v. United States, 90 F.3d 1284, 1288\r                                                     \r\n\n(7th Cir.  1996). Accordingly,  the judgment of  dismissal is\r\n\nsummarily affirmed.  See Local Rule 27.1.\r                                    \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n",
