American Dental Ass'n, 119 S. Ct. 2118\r\n(1999), affording a fresh perspective on the circumstances under\r\nwhich juries may award punitive damages in federal civil rights\r\ncases.  These cross-appeals require us to revisit the punitive\r\ndamages threshold in light of Kolstad.  After acquitting this\r\nresponsibility and addressing other pertinent issues, we affirm the\r\njudgment below.\r\nI.  BACKGROUND\r\nOn the evening of March 26, 1991, Richard Iacobucci, the\r\nplaintiff herein, visited the Pembroke Town Hall to videotape a\r\nscheduled meeting of the Pembroke Historic District Commission (the\r\nCommission).  Such forays were mother's milk to Iacobucci, who\r\nintermittently filmed sessions of local boards, including the\r\nCommission, for a weekly news program that he produced and\r\nbroadcast via a cable television outlet.\r\nOn the evening in question, the Commission's stated\r\npurpose was to review building applications.  The commissioners sat\r\nalong three sides of a four-sided conference table.  As he had done\r\nin the past, Iacobucci positioned his tripod at the unoccupied end\r\nof the table.  Soon after the meeting commenced, the chairman, Otis\r\nHathon, twice asked Iacobucci to move his equipment  across the\r\nroom.  Iacobucci declined, explaining that his view of the\r\ncommissioners' and applicants' faces would be obstructed.  Hathon\r\ndid not suffer rejection gladly; at one point, he extinguished the\r\nlights, remarking:  \"I hope your camera can see in the dark.\"  When\r\nthis petulance failed to sway Iacobucci, Hathon warned him of the\r\npossibility of arrest should he fail to move.  That warning, too,\r\nfell on deaf ears, prompting a commissioner to alert the local\r\nconstabulary.\r\nTwo Pembroke police officers, Flannery and Jenness,\r\nresponded.  They asked Iacobucci to turn off the camera and talk\r\nwith them in the corridor.  Iacobucci replied that he had a right\r\nto record the proceedings, that he intended to exercise it, and\r\nthat he would not converse until the meeting ended.  The stalemated\r\nofficers called their superior, Sergeant Willard Boulter (the\r\nprincipal defendant herein).\r\nThe meeting adjourned before Sgt. Boulter arrived,\r\npresumably because the last applicant had not appeared.  Iacobucci\r\npacked his gear.  He then noticed the commissioners speaking in the\r\nhallway with a man carrying a set of plans.  Believing that man to\r\nbe the tardy applicant, Iacobucci retrieved his camera and began\r\nfilming the group on the assumption that he was witnessing a de\r\nfacto resumption of the adjourned meeting.  Iacobucci persisted\r\ndespite importunings from some of the commissioners to stop.\r\nSgt. Boulter arrived at that juncture, stepped in front\r\nof the lens, and demanded that Iacobucci cease and desist. \r\nIacobucci demurred, sidestepped adroitly, and resumed his\r\njournalistic endeavor.  This pas de deux continued until Sgt.\r\nBoulter gave Iacobucci an ultimatum:  sit down or be arrested. \r\nWhen Iacobucci kept filming, Boulter took the camera from him,\r\ngrabbed his elbow, led him into another room, handcuffed him, and\r\nplaced him under arrest.\r\nThe police transported Iacobucci to the station house and\r\ncharged him with disorderly conduct and disrupting a public\r\nassembly.  Iacobucci spent about four hours in custody before the\r\nauthorities released him.  When he reclaimed his camera, he\r\ndiscovered that the videotape no longer contained any images and\r\nthat the sound track was barely audible.\r\nThe criminal charges eventually were dismissed, but\r\nIacobucci (a law school graduate, although not a practicing\r\nattorney) filed a pro se civil action that asserted a golconda of\r\nclaims against numerous defendants.  We need not dwell on the\r\ndetails, because pretrial proceedings winnowed the trialworthy\r\nissues to three claims pressed by Iacobucci against Boulter.  These\r\nincluded claims under 42 U.S.C.  1983 premised on false arrest and\r\nexcessive force, respectively, and a state-law claim premised on\r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress.  The three claims\r\nwere tried to a jury, which found for Boulter on two of them.  On\r\nthe section 1983 false arrest claim, however, the jury sided with\r\nIacobucci and awarded him $75,000 in compensatory damages and\r\n$135,000 in punitive damages.\r\nThe verdict did not please Boulter.  He renewed his\r\nearlier motion for judgment as a matter of law and asked,\r\nalternatively, for a new trial or for a remittitur.  The district\r\ncourt struck the punitive damages, but otherwise denied Boulter's\r\npost-trial motions.  Both parties now appeal.\r\nII.  BOULTER'S APPEAL\r\nLike all Gaul, Boulter's appeal is divided into three\r\nparts.  He assails the district court's handling of the section\r\n1983 false arrest claim because the court (1) should not have\r\npermitted the claim, if ever properly in the case, to go to trial;\r\n(2) improvidently admitted evidence that was both irrelevant and\r\nprejudicial; and (3) erred in rejecting a qualified  immunity\r\ndefense.  We examine these asseverations seriatim.\r\n    A.  The Status of the Section 1983 False Arrest Claim.\r\nThe wrangling over this issue breaks down into two\r\nsubsidiary questions:  Was the section 1983 false arrest claim\r\nproperly pled?  If so, did it survive summary judgment?  The\r\ndistrict court answered both questions affirmatively.  So do we.\r\nIn narrowing the issues immediately prior to trial, a\r\ndispute arose concerning what claims were outstanding.  Boulter\r\nconsidered only two claims to be zoetic:  a section 1983 excessive\r\nforce claim and a state-law claim for intentional infliction of\r\nemotional distress.  In contrast, Iacobucci took the position that\r\na section 1983 false arrest claim also remained in the case.  After\r\nreviewing the complaint and the summary judgment record, the lower\r\ncourt concluded that Iacobucci had adequately pled a section 1983\r\nfalse arrest claim, and that this claim had not been addressed (let\r\nalone terminated) at the summary judgment stage.  Consequently, the\r\ncourt allowed Iacobucci to litigate the claim.\r\nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint contain\r\na \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader\r\nis entitled to relief.\"  The complaint in this case satisfied that\r\nundemanding criterion vis--vis the section 1983 false arrest\r\nclaim:  it specifically alleged that Boulter, while acting under\r\ncolor of state law, violated Iacobucci's constitutional \"right to\r\nbe secure in his person\" and \"wrongfully deprived him of his\r\nliberty.\"  This language, coupled with a prayer for money damages,\r\nadequately stated a section 1983 false arrest claim.\r\nTo be sure, the claim could have been pled more clearly. \r\nHere, however, Boulter has not identified a scintilla of prejudice\r\nthat may have resulted from any obscurity in the wording of the\r\nplaintiff's complaint, nor is any such prejudice readily apparent. \r\nThe section 1983 false arrest claim arises out of the same nucleus\r\nof operative fact as the other two tried claims (both of which\r\nBoulter acknowledges were in the case all along), and the parties'\r\ndiscussions with the court immediately before the start of trial\r\nclarified any uncertainty about whether the section 1983 false\r\narrest claim was to be litigated.  The sockdolager is this:  had\r\nprejudice loomed, Boulter could have asked the court for a\r\ncontinuance.  His failure to do so leads ineluctably to the\r\nconclusion that any claim of unfairness that he now might assert is\r\nnothing more than a post hoc rationalization sparked by a verdict\r\nthat was not to his liking.  See Faigin v. Kelly,     F.3d    ,    \r\n(1st Cir. 1999) [No. 98-1589, slip op. at 34] (explaining that \"a\r\nreviewing court may attribute special significance to the party's\r\neschewal of a continuance and assume that the party did not require\r\nadditional time to adjust his litigation strategy\").\r\nWe likewise reject Boulter's plaint that the section 1983\r\nfalse arrest claim, even if pled, did not survive the district\r\ncourt's summary judgment order.  In hawking this proposition,\r\nBoulter points to the concluding passage in the trial court's\r\nsummary judgment ruling, in which Judge Saris stated:  \"With\r\nrespect to Sergeant Boulter, the motion is DENIED on the excessive\r\nforce claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C.  1983, and the intentional\r\ninfliction of emotional distress claim.  Otherwise it is ALLOWED.\" \r\nBoulter maintains that these final four words laid to rest any\r\nincipient section 1983 false arrest claim.\r\nThis argument is too cute by half.  It overlooks that\r\nBoulter's motion, which set the stage for the court's summary\r\njudgment ruling, never sought brevis disposition as to the section\r\n1983 false arrest claim.  Thus, when Boulter made this very\r\nargument below, the district court rejected it, explaining that the\r\n\"otherwise\" language spoke only to the claims that had been debated\r\nin the summary judgment papers   and that the section 1983 false\r\narrest claim was not among that number.  A trial court ordinarily\r\nis the best expositor of its own orders, see United States v.\r\nPodolsky, 158 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998); Martha's Vineyard Scuba\r\nHeadquarters, Inc. v. Unidentified, Wrecked and Abandoned Steam\r\nVessel, 833 F.2d 1059, 1066-67 (1st Cir. 1987), and Boulter offers\r\nno convincing reason why we should ignore this salutary principle\r\nhere.  Because the district court reasonably interpreted its own\r\norder as not terminating the section 1983 false arrest claim, we\r\nhonor its interpretation.\r\n                B.  The Evidentiary Question.\r\nBoulter next insists that the trial court erred in\r\nadmitting the partially erased videotape into evidence.  He bases\r\nthis insistence on three grounds:  lack of relevance, lack of a\r\nproper foundation, and undue prejudice.  We review challenges to\r\norders admitting or excluding evidence for abuse of discretion. \r\nSee Faigin,     F.3d at     [slip op. at 24]; Williams v. Drake,\r\n146 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 1998).  We discern none here.\r\nThe facts are these.  The videotape itself had been\r\nerased by parties unknown (although Iacobucci understandably\r\nsuspected the police).  At any rate, the audio portion of the tape\r\npicked up after the time that the police took Iacobucci into\r\ncustody.  It apparently recorded contemporaneous conversations\r\namongst Boulter and his fellow officers.  Boulter's objection runs\r\nto the admissibility of those comments.\r\nBoulter's first line of attack emphasizes the temporal\r\nsequence.  He argues that an after-the-fact recording necessarily\r\nlacks relevance.  This ipse dixit is simply wrong.  Evidence of\r\nsubsequent events frequently sheds light upon, and thus assumes\r\nrelevance in relation to, antecedent acts.  See United States v.\r\nLara, 181 F.3d 183, 204 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Sutton,\r\n970 F.2d 1001, 1007 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Mena, 933\r\nF.2d 19, 25 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991).\r\nIn this instance, the district court supportably\r\ndetermined that rational jurors might find that some of the\r\nstatements made on the tape referred back to what had transpired at\r\nthe time of the arrest.  We recount a sampling in the margin. \r\nRelevancy is a fluid concept under the Evidence Rules.  See Fed. R.\r\nEvid. 401 (defining relevant evidence as \"having any tendency to\r\nmake the existence\" of any material fact \"more probable or less\r\nprobable than it would be without the evidence\").  Consequently,\r\nrelevancy typically presents a rather low barrier to admissibility. \r\nSee, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Expressway Sewerage Constr., Inc., 177\r\nF.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d\r\n754, 780 (1st Cir. 1995).  Taking into account that the excessive\r\nforce, emotional distress, and false arrest claims were being tried\r\ntogether, we conclude that Judge Saris acted within the encincture\r\nof her discretion in deciding that the challenged statements\r\ncleared this hurdle.\r\nBoulter's second line of attack centers on his contention\r\nthat the audio portion of the tape ought to have been excluded\r\nbecause Iacobucci's enhancement of it somehow destroyed the tape's\r\nintegrity.  This contention amounts to a claim that the evidence\r\nlacked a proper foundation.  Such claims are committed to the trial\r\njudge's informed discretion.  See United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d\r\n954, 956 (1st Cir. 1989); see also Fed. R. Evid. 901(a), 1001(2) &amp;\r\n1002.\r\nBoulter's contention trenches on the frivolous. \r\nIacobucci testified to the chain of custody.  He also testified\r\nthat he did not alter the tape in any way, but, rather, enhanced\r\nthe sound by the simple expedient of listening to it on a high-\r\nquality play-back system that increased its audibility.  The judge\r\n(and the jury, for that matter) were free to credit this testimony,\r\nespecially since Boulter offered no evidence to contradict it.  No\r\nmore was exigible.\r\nBoulter's final line of attack postulates that the\r\nfailure to identify the voices on the tape prior to its admission\r\ninto evidence created unfair prejudice.  See Fed. R. Evid. 403. \r\nThis argument, too, strikes us as insubstantial.\r\nAs noted above, the tape itself was properly\r\nauthenticated prior to its admission.  Thereafter, several\r\nwitnesses (mainly police officers) testified as to the identities\r\nof the speakers.  Moreover, the officers whose voices were alleged\r\nto have been captured on the tape (Boulter among them) testified at\r\ntrial; the jury thus had the opportunity to determine for itself\r\nwho spoke which lines.\r\nAgainst this backdrop, we see no Rule 403 problem.  The\r\nrule does not aspire to eliminate prejudice   after all, most\r\nevidence is offered precisely because the proponent believes it\r\nwill prejudice the factfinder in his favor   but only to eliminate\r\nunfair prejudice.  See, e.g., Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership\r\nv. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1372 (1st Cir. 1991); United\r\nStates v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir. 1989). \r\nGiven the sound track's potentially significant probative value\r\n(especially in regard to Boulter's state of mind as it pertained to\r\nthe section 1983 excessive force claim) and the absence of any\r\nunfairly prejudicial impact, we cannot fault the district court's\r\noverruling of Boulter's Rule 403 objection.  See Freeman v. Package\r\nMach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"Only rarely   and\r\nin extraordinarily compelling circumstances   will we, from the\r\nvista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-\r\nthe-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative\r\nvalue and unfair effect.\").\r\n                   C.  Qualified Immunity.\r\n42 U.S.C.  1983 provides a private right of action\r\nagainst officials who, while acting under color of state law,\r\ndeprive individuals of federally assured rights.  But this kind of\r\nrights-violating conduct does not translate automatically into\r\nmoney damages, for a state actor may enjoy an immunity (absolute or\r\nqualified).  In this instance, Boulter says that the lower court\r\nerred in failing to exonerate him based on the doctrine of\r\nqualified immunity.\r\nQualified immunity is a medium through which \"the law\r\nstrives to balance its desire to compensate those whose rights are\r\ninfringed by state actors with an equally compelling desire to\r\nshield public servants from undue interference with the performance\r\nof their duties and from threats of liability which, though\r\nunfounded, may nevertheless be unbearably disruptive.\"  Buenrostro\r\nv. Collazo, 973 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing Harlow v.\r\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 806 (1982)).  \"Hence, state officials\r\nexercising discretionary authority are entitled to qualified\r\nimmunity insofar as their conduct does not transgress clearly\r\nestablished constitutional or federal statutory rights of which a\r\nreasonably prudent official should have been aware.\"  Id.  To\r\nascertain a defendant's eligibility for such immunity, a court must\r\ninquire into the objective legal reasonableness of the defendant's\r\nactions, gauged in connection with the mosaic of legal rules that\r\nwere clearly established when the defendant acted.  See Anderson v.\r\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639 (1987).  In operation, the outcome of\r\nthis inquiry \"depends substantially upon the level of generality at\r\nwhich the relevant 'legal rule' is to be identified.\"  Id.\r\nIacobucci  asserts that Boulter, a policeman acting under\r\ncolor of his official authority, lacked probable cause to arrest\r\nhim and thereby violated his Fourth Amendment rights.  In this\r\nwise, he observes that a citizen's right to be free from arrest in\r\nthe absence of probable cause has long been clearly established. \r\nSee, e.g., Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964).  That observation\r\nsweeps so broadly, however, that it bears very little relationship\r\nto the objective legal reasonableness vel non of Boulter's harm-\r\ninducing conduct.  See Wilson v. Layne, 119 S. Ct. 1692, 1699-1700\r\n(1999).  The \"right the official is alleged to have violated must\r\nhave been 'clearly established' in a more particularized, and hence\r\nmore relevant, sense.\"  Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640.  Our inquiry,\r\nthen, reduces to whether a reasonable police officer, standing in\r\nBoulter's shoes, would have known that arresting Iacobucci for\r\ndisorderly conduct, under all the attendant circumstances, would\r\ncontravene clearly established law.  That inquiry must proceed in\r\nlight of the commonly held understanding that probable cause exists\r\nonly if the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer's\r\nknowledge \"are sufficient to lead an ordinarily prudent officer to\r\nconclude that an offense has been, is being, or is about to be\r\ncommitted, and that the putative arrestee is involved in the\r\ncrime's commission.\"  Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1044 (1st Cir.\r\n1997).\r\nBefore wrestling with this question, we pause to voice\r\nsome procedural concerns.  Boulter first raised the issue of\r\nqualified immunity in a pretrial motion for summary judgment. \r\nAlthough he tries in this forum to assign error to the denial of\r\nthat motion, a pair of procedural impediments frustrates the\r\nattempt.  For one thing, an order denying summary judgment\r\ntypically does not merge into the final judgment and therefore is\r\nnot an independently appealable event if the case thereafter\r\nproceeds to trial.  See Eastern Mountain Platform Tennis, Inc. v.\r\nSherwin-Williams Co., 40 F.3d 492, 497 (1st Cir. 1994).\r\nFor another thing, in his notice of appeal, Boulter\r\npurported to challenge only the amended judgment entered by the\r\ndistrict court on March 31, 1997   a decree sparked by the court's\r\ndenial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law.  \"It is\r\nblack-letter law that a notice of appeal must specify the order or\r\njudgment to which the appeal is addressed.\"  Lehman v. Revolution\r\nPortfolio LLC, 166 F.3d 389, 395 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing Fed. R.\r\nApp. P. 3(c)).  Boulter's failure to specify the order denying\r\nsummary judgment in his notice of appeal thus bars his current\r\nattempt to contest the propriety of that ruling.  See id.\r\nIn all events, the district court supportably concluded\r\nthat Boulter's summary judgment motion did not seek to test the\r\nbona fides of the section 1983 false arrest claim.  See supra Part\r\nII(A).  Since the scope of the protection afforded by the doctrine\r\nof qualified immunity is claim-specific, see, e.g., Feliciano-\r\nAngulo v. Rivera-Cruz, 858 F.2d 40, 48 (1st Cir. 1988); Vazquez\r\nRios v. Hernandez Colon, 819 F.2d 319, 326-28 (1st Cir. 1987), this\r\nomission means that Boulter could not have raised a qualified\r\nimmunity defense as to that claim at the summary judgment stage. \r\nAnd Boulter's assertion in the motion papers of a qualified\r\nimmunity defense in regard to Iacobucci's section 1983 excessive\r\nforce claim cannot fill this void.\r\nNotwithstanding these infirmities,  the qualified\r\nimmunity issue is not a dead letter.  Although qualified immunity\r\nnormally should be resolved early in the litigation, see Mitchell\r\nv. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985), the defense, if preserved,\r\nmay be pressed at later stages, including in a timeous post-trial\r\nmotion.  See, e.g., Consolo v. George, 58 F.3d 791, 794 (1st Cir.\r\n1995).  Because Boulter filed such a motion and now assigns error\r\nto its denial, the issue must be addressed.\r\nIn the ordinary course, we review the district court's\r\ndenial of qualified immunity de novo, aligning the evidence most\r\nfavorably to the non-movant and drawing all reasonable inferences\r\nin his favor.  See, e.g., Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos, 151 F.3d 1, 8\r\n(1st Cir. 1998); Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 752-53 (1st Cir.\r\n1990).  But this familiar formulation of the standard arises in\r\nconnection with pretrial orders granting or denying qualified\r\nimmunity, and Iacobucci maintains that the intervening trial and\r\nverdict pretermit (or, at least, reconfigure) the inquiry.  He\r\npoints out that when Boulter made the arrest, he charged Iacobucci\r\nwith having committed two offenses:  disorderly conduct and\r\ndisturbing a public assembly.  Iacobucci notes correctly that this\r\ncharging decision circumscribes the inquiry into probable cause. \r\nBuilding on this foundation, he posits that we need not look beyond\r\nthe verdict, in which the jury, answering a special interrogatory,\r\nfound that no reasonable police officer would have believed that\r\nIacobucci had committed either offense.  Boulter resists this\r\napproach:  he asserts that the jury's merits determination neither\r\nextinguishes nor bears upon his claim of entitlement to qualified\r\nimmunity.\r\nNot surprisingly, there is a middle ground.  A state\r\nactor may be entitled to qualified immunity for rights-violating\r\nconduct as long as he had an objectively reasonable basis for\r\nbelieving that his conduct would not abridge the rights of others. \r\nSee Camilo-Robles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 1999);\r\nQuintero de Quintero v. Aponte-Roque, 974 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir.\r\n1992).  This means, of course, that the reasonableness standards\r\nunderlying the probable cause and qualified immunity inquiries are\r\nnot coterminous.  See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641.  Thus, the jury's\r\ndetermination does not squarely answer the question whether\r\nBoulter's conduct in arresting Iacobucci satisfied the criterion of\r\nobjective legal reasonableness so as to entitle him to qualified\r\nimmunity.\r\nNor does the procedural posture in which Boulter's appeal\r\narises greatly influence the standard of review.  When a qualified\r\nimmunity defense is pressed after a jury verdict, the evidence must\r\nbe construed in the light most hospitable to the party that\r\nprevailed at trial.  See Thompson v. Mahre, 110 F.3d 716, 721 (9th\r\nCir. 1997); Karnes v. Skrutski, 62 F.3d 485, 494 (3d Cir. 1995);\r\nPosr v. Doherty, 944 F.2d 91, 95-96 (2d Cir. 1991).  One difference\r\nis that, in such an exercise, deference should be accorded to the\r\njury's discernible resolution of disputed factual issues.  See\r\nFrazell v. Flanigan, 102 F.3d 877, 886 (7th Cir. 1996).\r\nWith this paradigm in mind, we turn to the facts.  The\r\nfirst of the two charges on which Boulter arrested Iacobucci  \r\ndisorderly conduct   implicated Mass. Gen. Laws c. 272,  53.  In\r\npertinent part, the statute makes it a misdemeanor to be a\r\n\"disorderly person.\"  To stave off constitutional attacks, the\r\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) originally construed\r\nsection 53 to provide that one is guilty under that rubric \r\n  . . . if, with purpose to cause public\r\ninconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or\r\nrecklessly creating a risk thereof, he:  (a)\r\nengages in fighting or threatening, or in\r\nviolent or tumultuous behavior; or (b) makes\r\nunreasonable noise or offensively coarse\r\nutterance, gesture or display, or addresses\r\nabusive language to any person present; or (c)\r\ncreates a hazardous or physically offensive\r\ncondition by any act which serves no\r\nlegitimate purpose of the actor.\r\n\nAlegata v. Commonwealth, 231 N.E.2d 201, 211 (Mass. 1967) (quoting\r\nProposed Official Draft of Model Penal Code  250.2).\r\nIn the next decade, the SJC narrowed this definition of\r\ndisorderly conduct to encompass only activities not implicating the\r\n\"lawful exercise of a First Amendment right.\"  Commonwealth v. A\r\nJuvenile, 334 N.E.2d 617, 628 (Mass. 1975).  To ensure that result,\r\nthe SJC modified its earlier definition by striking subsection (b)\r\nentirely and interpreting subsections (a) and (c) to cover only\r\nconduct, not expressive activity.  See id. at 629.  Consistent with\r\nthis approach, the SJC subsequently held that a verbal challenge,\r\neven when coupled with a refusal to obey a police officer's orders,\r\ndoes not constitute disorderly conduct within the meaning of\r\nsection 53 as long as done in furtherance of a legitimate purpose. \r\nSee Commonwealth v. Feigenbaum, 536 N.E.2d 325, 328 (Mass. 1989). \r\nTo this extent, then, the contours of the disorderly conduct\r\nstatute were clearly visible when Boulter confronted Iacobucci at\r\nthe Pembroke Town Hall.\r\nContext is important in police work, as elsewhere in\r\nhuman intercourse.  Thus, upon being apprised of the ongoing events\r\nat the Town Hall, Boulter recognized that the circumstances\r\nrequired a reasonable police officer to take into account the\r\nMassachusetts Open Meeting Law, Mass. Gen. Laws c. 39,  23B, and\r\nhe took steps to refresh his recollection of that enactment.  The\r\nstatute requires that \"[a]ll meetings of a governmental body . . .\r\nbe open to the public,\" and confers a right to videotape such\r\nmeetings on \"any person in attendance.\"  The right to videotape is\r\nnot unfettered:  the camera must be \"fixed in one or more\r\ndesignated locations determined by the governmental body,\" and the\r\ntaping may not actively interfere \"with the conduct of the\r\nmeeting.\"  Id.  Withal, the statute does \"not apply to any chance\r\nmeeting, or a social meeting at which matters relating to official\r\nbusiness are discussed so long as no final agreement is reached.\" \r\nId.\r\nGiven this background, we are constrained to conclude\r\nthat, taking the evidence in the light most flattering to\r\nIacobucci, his constitutional right to act as he did without being\r\narrested for disorderly conduct was \"sufficiently clear that a\r\nreasonable official would [have understood] that what he [was]\r\ndoing violate[d] that right.\"  Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640; accord\r\nWagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 209 (1st Cir. 1987).\r\nTaking first the events that transpired in the meeting\r\nroom, we note that Iacobucci had satisfied the basic prerequisites\r\nfor entitlement to videotape a public meeting under the Open\r\nMeeting Law:  he had situated his tripod in the only stationary\r\nlocation that would allow the mounted camera to capture the faces\r\nof both the commissioners and the applicants and there is no\r\nsignificantly probative evidence that his activities interfered\r\nwith the ongoing meeting.  Indeed, his equipment had been placed\r\nin the very same location during prior Commission meetings, without\r\nincident.  Moreover, after Hathon tired of trying to bully\r\nIacobucci, the instant meeting proceeded without disruption and the\r\nCommission completed its business unimpeded by the filming. \r\nIacobucci remained cool, calm, and collected throughout.  Under the\r\ncircumstances and in light of the clearly established law that\r\nobtained at the time of the incident, we agree with Judge Saris\r\nthat an objectively reasonable officer would not have thought that\r\nIacobucci was subject to arrest for disorderly conduct.\r\nTaking next the hallway episode, we find nothing whatever\r\nto suggest that Iacobucci was \"fighting or threatening,\" or was\r\nengaged in any \"violent or tumultuous behavior.\"  A Juvenile, 334\r\nN.E.2d at 628; see also Sheehy v. Plymouth,     F.3d    ,     (1st\r\nCir. 1999) [No. 98-2080, slip op. at 16].  On any version of the\r\nevents reflected in the record, no objectively reasonable police\r\nofficer would have believed that Iacobucci had created a \"hazardous\r\nor physically offensive condition . . . which serve[d] no\r\nlegitimate purpose.\"  A Juvenile, 334 N.E.2d at 628.  Even if the\r\ngathering was not a public meeting at that point, Iacobucci was\r\ndoing nothing wrong:  he was in a public area of a public building;\r\nhe had a right to be there; he filmed the group from a comfortable\r\nremove; and he neither spoke to nor molested them in any way.\r\nBoulter's repeated demands that Iacobucci cease recording\r\ndo not change the disorderly conduct calculus.  A police officer is\r\nnot a law unto himself; he cannot give an order that has no\r\ncolorable legal basis and then arrest a person who defies it. So it\r\nis here:  because Iacobucci's activities were peaceful, not\r\nperformed in derogation of any law, and done in the exercise of his\r\nFirst Amendment rights, Boulter lacked the authority to stop them.\r\nThe other ground of arrest fares no better under close\r\nscrutiny.  That ground implicated Mass. Gen. Laws c. 272,  40,\r\nwhich makes it a misdemeanor to \"willfully interrupt[] or disturb[]\r\na school or other assembly.\"  As to the events that transpired in\r\nthe meeting room, the record, read as it must be in the light most\r\nfavorable to Iacobucci, contains no evidence that he \"interrupted\r\nor disturbed\" the Commission's meeting.  See supra note 5 and\r\naccompanying text.  As to the events that transpired in the\r\nhallway, Boulter was adamant in his insistence that the hallway\r\ngathering was not a public meeting.\r\nThere is no point in flogging a dead horse.  We conclude\r\nthat the district court did not err in holding that Boulter's\r\narrest of Iacobucci failed to attain the level of objective legal\r\nreasonableness.  Hence, Boulter was not entitled to qualified\r\nimmunity.\r\nIII.  IACOBUCCI'S APPEAL\r\nAlthough voicing doubts about whether a satisfactory\r\nfoundation for punitive damages had been laid, the district court\r\nprudently reserved judgment on that question and sent it to the\r\njury.  After the jurors awarded Iacobucci $75,000 in compensatory\r\ndamages and $135,000 in punitive damages, Boulter moved for relief. \r\nConcluding that the evidence failed to warrant punitive damages,\r\nthe district court struck that portion of the award (albeit leaving\r\nintact the compensatory damages).  Iacobucci contests this ruling. \r\nWe review the lower court's decision de novo, taking the facts and\r\nthe reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most congenial to\r\nthe jury's verdict.  See Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d\r\n1184, 1188 (1st Cir. 1995).\r\nThe district court's approach accurately foretold that\r\ntaken by the Supreme Court a few months later in Kolstad v.\r\nAmerican Dental Ass'n, 119 S. Ct. 2118 (1999).  Punitive damages\r\nbecome a discretionary matter for the jury in a section 1983 action\r\nonly if the plaintiff makes an adequate threshold showing.  A\r\nplaintiff reaches that threshold when \"the defendant's conduct is\r\nshown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves\r\nreckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights\r\nof others.\"  Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983).\r\nKolstad sheds considerable light on Smith and the\r\ncircumstances under which a judge may permit a jury to consider a\r\nrequest for punitive damages in a civil rights case.  The Smith\r\nstandard, visualized through the Kolstad lens, confirms that there\r\nis a different focus for compensatory as opposed to punitive\r\ndamages.  See Kolstad, 119 S. Ct. at 2124.  The special showing\r\nneeded to trigger eligibility for punitive damages, which the Smith\r\nCourt called \"evil motive\" or \"reckless  or callous indifference,\"\r\nSmith, 461 U.S. at 56, pertains to the defendant's \"knowledge that\r\n[he] may be acting in violation of federal law, not [his] awareness\r\nthat [he] is engaging in discrimination,\" Kolstad, 119 S. Ct. at\r\n2124.  Thus, the standard requires proof that the defendant acted\r\n\"in the face of a perceived risk that [his] actions [would] violate\r\nfederal law.\"  Id. at 2125.  While \"egregious or outrageous acts\r\nmay serve as evidence supporting an inference of the requisite\r\n'evil motive,'\" the presence (or absence) of such acts does not in\r\nitself determine the propriety (or lack of propriety) of punitive\r\ndamages in a given case.  Id. at 2126.\r\nTo make out a jury question on punitive damages under\r\nthis subjectively oriented test, Iacobucci needed to adduce\r\nevidence sufficient to prove that Boulter arrested him in the face\r\nof a perceived risk that doing so would violate Iacobucci's\r\nfederally assured rights.  More specifically, Iacobucci needed to\r\nadduce evidence sufficient to show that Boulter determined to\r\neffectuate the arrest knowing that he lacked probable cause to do\r\nso, or, at least, with conscious indifference to the possibility\r\nthat he lacked probable cause.\r\nWe realize that the district court instructed the jury to\r\ndetermine whether Boulter had acted intentionally or recklessly in\r\narresting Iacobucci, and that the jury, by returning a plaintiff's\r\nverdict on the section 1983 false arrest claim, necessarily found\r\nthat Boulter's conduct fit into that proscribed category.  This\r\nmens rea finding, however, does not clear the way for punitive\r\ndamages.  The state of mind required to make out a cognizable\r\nsection 1983 claim (at least one grounded in false arrest) differs\r\nimportantly from that required to justify punitive damages.  See\r\nKolstad, 119 S. Ct. at 2124.  The former requirement relates only\r\nto the conduct, not to the consequence; that is, it entails an\r\nintent to do the act, not to effect a civil rights violation.  See\r\nid.\r\nOn this issue, the district court concluded that although\r\nBoulter made an objectively unreasonable split-second decision when\r\nhe arrested Iacobucci, no evidence suggested that he harbored any\r\nmalice or acted with reckless indifference to Iacobucci's\r\nconstitutional rights.  After carefully scrutinizing the record, we\r\nagree with this assessment.  Viewed most favorably to Iacobucci,\r\nthe evidence reveals that when apprised of the contretemps, Boulter\r\ncalled a selectman to get a better sense of the Open Meeting Law. \r\nUpon his arrival, he attempted to piece together a complete picture\r\nof the evening's events.  He then  made several attempts to defuse\r\na contentious situation.  Only after his attempted intercessions\r\nwere rebuffed did he effect an arrest.  This constellation of facts\r\ndoes not lend itself to the inference that Boulter acted with an\r\nevil motive or a conscious awareness that the arrest might violate\r\nIacobucci's civil rights.  Where, as here, the evidence shows no\r\nmore than that an exasperated police officer, acting in the heat of\r\nthe moment, made an objectively unreasonable mistake, punitive\r\ndamages will not lie.\r\nLaboring to close this gap, Iacobucci suggests that the\r\npartially erased videotape contains evidence indicative of a state\r\nof mind conducive to punitive damages.  He points to a statement\r\ncontained therein from which (he says) the jury could have inferred\r\nthat the videotape had been erased to provide cover against a\r\npotential excessive force claim.  The jury, however, found for\r\nBoulter on the section 1983 excessive force count   and the\r\nvideotape contains nothing that bears on Boulter's motives in\r\nconnection with the arrest.  We conclude, therefore, that this\r\nevidence fails to lift the punitive damages issue into the realm of\r\nthe jury's discretion.\r\nTo summarize, the district court acted appropriately in\r\ndefenestrating the punitive damages award.  The dearth of record\r\nevidence, direct or circumstantial, as to Boulter's evil motive\r\nand/or subjective awareness that he lacked probable cause to arrest\r\nIacobucci suffices to defeat the claim for punitive damages as a\r\nmatter of law.\r\nWe add a coda.  Precedent in this circuit had interpreted\r\nSmith to mean that in civil rights cases requiring proof of\r\nintentional wrongdoing, \"the state of mind necessary to trigger\r\nliability for the wrong is at least as culpable as that required to\r\nmake punitive damages applicable.\"  Rowlett v. Anheuser-Busch,\r\nInc., 832 F.2d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 1987).  Kolstad plainly rejects\r\nthat interpretation.  To the extent that Rowlett fails to draw a\r\ndistinction between the state of mind requirement anent the actor's\r\nconduct and the state of mind requirement anent the effects of that\r\nconduct, it is no longer good law, and we disavow it.\r\nIV.  CONCLUSION\r\nWe need go no further.  For the reasons set forth above,\r\nwe reject all three appeals and leave the parties where we found\r\nthem.\r\n\nAffirmed.  Each party to bear his own costs.\n",

These cross-appeals require us to revisit the punitive damages threshold in light of Kolstad. After acquitting this responsibility and addressing other pertinent issues, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of March 26, 1991, Richard Iacobucci, the plaintiff herein, visited the Pembroke Town Hall to videotape a scheduled meeting of the Pembroke Historic District Commission (the Commission). Such forays were mother's milk to Iacobucci, who intermittently filmed sessions of local boards, including the Commission, for a weekly news program that he produced and broadcast via a cable television outlet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening in question, the Commission's stated purpose was to review building applications. The commissioners sat along three sides of a four-sided conference table. As he had done in the past, Iacobucci positioned his tripod at the unoccupied end of the table. Soon after the meeting commenced, the chairman, Otis Hathon, twice asked Iacobucci to move his equipment across the room. Iacobucci declined, explaining that his view of the commissioners' and applicants' faces would be obstructed. Hathon did not suffer rejection gladly; at one point, he extinguished the lights, remarking: \"I hope your camera can see in the dark.\" When this petulance failed to sway Iacobucci, Hathon warned him of the possibility of arrest should he fail to move. That warning, too, fell on deaf ears, prompting a commissioner to alert the local constabulary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two Pembroke police officers, Flannery and Jenness, responded. They asked Iacobucci to turn off the camera and talk with them in the corridor. Iacobucci replied that he had a right to record the proceedings, that he intended to exercise it, and that he would not converse until the meeting ended. The stalemated officers called their superior, Sergeant Willard Boulter (the principal defendant herein).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meeting adjourned before Sgt. Boulter arrived, presumably because the last applicant had not appeared. Iacobucci packed his gear. He then noticed the commissioners speaking in the hallway with a man carrying a set of plans. Believing that man to be the tardy applicant, Iacobucci retrieved his camera and began filming the group on the assumption that he was witnessing a de facto resumption of the adjourned meeting. Iacobucci persisted despite importunings from some of the commissioners to stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sgt. Boulter arrived at that juncture, stepped in front of the lens, and demanded that Iacobucci cease and desist. Iacobucci demurred, sidestepped adroitly, and resumed his journalistic endeavor. This pas de deux continued until Sgt. Boulter gave Iacobucci an ultimatum: sit down or be arrested. When Iacobucci kept filming, Boulter took the camera from him, grabbed his elbow, led him into another room, handcuffed him, and placed him under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police transported Iacobucci to the station house and charged him with disorderly conduct and disrupting a public assembly. Iacobucci spent about four hours in custody before the authorities released him. When he reclaimed his camera, he discovered that the videotape no longer contained any images and that the sound track was barely audible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The criminal charges eventually were dismissed, but Iacobucci (a law school graduate, although not a practicing attorney) filed a pro se civil action that asserted a golconda of claims against numerous defendants. We need not dwell on the details, because pretrial proceedings winnowed the trialworthy issues to three claims pressed by Iacobucci against Boulter. These included claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 premised on false arrest and excessive force, respectively, and a state-law claim premised on intentional infliction of emotional distress. The three claims were tried to a jury, which found for Boulter on two of them. On the section 1983 false arrest claim, however, the jury sided with Iacobucci and awarded him $75,000 in compensatory damages and $135,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdict did not please Boulter. He renewed his earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law and asked, alternatively, for a new trial or for a remittitur. The district court struck the punitive damages, but otherwise denied Boulter's post-trial motions. Both parties now appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. BOULTER'S APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like all Gaul, Boulter's appeal is divided into three parts. He assails the district court's handling of the section 1983 false arrest claim because the court (1) should not have permitted the claim, if ever properly in the case, to go to trial; (2) improvidently admitted evidence that was both irrelevant and prejudicial; and (3) erred in rejecting a qualified immunity defense. We examine these asseverations seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Status of the Section 1983 False Arrest Claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wrangling over this issue breaks down into two subsidiary questions: Was the section 1983 false arrest claim properly pled? If so, did it survive summary judgment? The district court answered both questions affirmatively. So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In narrowing the issues immediately prior to trial, a dispute arose concerning what claims were outstanding. Boulter considered only two claims to be zoetic: a section 1983 excessive force claim and a state-law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. In contrast, Iacobucci took the position that a section 1983 false arrest claim also remained in the case. After reviewing the complaint and the summary judgment record, the lower court concluded that Iacobucci had adequately pled a section 1983 false arrest claim, and that this claim had not been addressed (let alone terminated) at the summary judgment stage. Consequently, the court allowed Iacobucci to litigate the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" The complaint in this case satisfied that undemanding criterion vis-a-vis the section 1983 false arrest claim: it specifically alleged that Boulter, while acting under color of state law, violated Iacobucci's constitutional \"right to be secure in his person\" and \"wrongfully deprived him of his liberty.\" This language, coupled with a prayer for money damages, adequately stated a section 1983 false arrest claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the claim could have been pled more clearly. Here, however, Boulter has not identified a scintilla of prejudice that may have resulted from any obscurity in the wording of the plaintiff's complaint, nor is any such prejudice readily apparent. The section 1983 false arrest claim arises out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the other two tried claims (both of which Boulter acknowledges were in the case all along), and the parties' discussions with the court immediately before the start of trial clarified any uncertainty about whether the section 1983 false arrest claim was to be litigated. The sockdolager is this: had prejudice loomed, Boulter could have asked the court for a continuance. His failure to do so leads ineluctably to the conclusion that any claim of unfairness that he now might assert is nothing more than a post hoc rationalization sparked by a verdict that was not to his liking. See Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 85 (1st Cir. 1999) (explaining that \"a reviewing court may attribute special significance to the party's eschewal of a continuance and assume that the party did not require additional time to adjust his litigation strategy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We likewise reject Boulter's plaint that the section 1983 false arrest claim, even if pled, did not survive the district court's summary judgment order. In hawking this proposition, Boulter points to the concluding passage in the trial court's summary judgment ruling, in which Judge Saris stated: \"With respect to Sergeant Boulter, the motion is DENIED on the excessive force claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Otherwise it is ALLOWED.\" Boulter maintains that these final four words laid to rest any incipient section 1983 false arrest claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is too cute by half. It overlooks that Boulter's motion, which set the stage for the court's summary judgment ruling, never sought brevis disposition as to the section 1983 false arrest claim. Thus, when Boulter made this very argument below, the district court rejected it, explaining that the \"otherwise\" language spoke only to the claims that had been debated in the summary judgment papers -- and that the section 1983 false arrest claim was not among that number. A trial court ordinarily is the best expositor of its own orders, see United States v. Podolsky, 158 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998); Martha's Vineyard Scuba Headquarters, Inc. v. Unidentified, Wrecked and Abandoned Steam Vessel, 833 F.2d 1059, 1066-67 (1st Cir. 1987), and Boulter offers no convincing reason why we should ignore this salutary principle here. Because the district court reasonably interpreted its own order as not terminating the section 1983 false arrest claim, we honor its interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Evidentiary Question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter next insists that the trial court erred in admitting the partially erased videotape into evidence. He bases this insistence on three grounds: lack of relevance, lack of a proper foundation, and undue prejudice. We review challenges to orders admitting or excluding evidence for abuse of discretion. See Faigin, 184 F.3d at 81 ; Williams v. Drake, 146 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 1998). We discern none here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are these. The videotape itself had been erased by parties unknown (although Iacobucci understandably suspected the police). At any rate, the audio portion of the tape picked up after the time that the police took Iacobucci into custody. It apparently recorded contemporaneous conversations amongst Boulter and his fellow officers. Boulter's objection runs to the admissibility of those comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter's first line of attack emphasizes the temporal sequence. He argues that an after-the-fact recording necessarily lacks relevance. This ipse dixit is simply wrong. Evidence of subsequent events frequently sheds light upon, and thus assumes relevance in relation to, antecedent acts. See United States v. Lara, 181 F.3d 183, 204 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Sutton, 970 F.2d 1001, 1007 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Mena, 933 F.2d 19, 25 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court supportably determined that rational jurors might find that some of the statements made on the tape referred back to what had transpired at the time of the arrest. We recount a sampling in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Relevancy is a fluid concept under the Evidence Rules. See Fed. R. Evid. 401 (defining relevant evidence as \"having any tendency to make the existence\" of any material fact \"more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\"). Consequently, relevancy typically presents a rather low barrier to admissibility. See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Expressway Sewerage Constr., Inc., 177 F.3d 71, 75 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 780 (1st Cir. 1995). Taking into account that the excessive force, emotional distress, and false arrest claims were being tried together, we conclude that Judge Saris acted within the encincture of her discretion in deciding that the challenged statements cleared this hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter's second line of attack centers on his contention that the audio portion of the tape ought to have been excluded because Iacobucci's enhancement of it somehow destroyed the tape's integrity. This contention amounts to a claim that the evidence lacked a proper foundation. Such claims are committed to the trial judge's informed discretion. See United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 956 (1st Cir. 1989); see also Fed. R. Evid. 901(a), 1001(2) &amp; 1002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter's contention trenches on the frivolous. Iacobucci testified to the chain of custody. He also testified that he did not alter the tape in any way, but, rather, enhanced the sound by the simple expedient of listening to it on a high-quality play-back system that increased its audibility. The judge (and the jury, for that matter) were free to credit this testimony, especially since Boulter offered no evidence to contradict it. No more was exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter's final line of attack postulates that the failure to identify the voices on the tape prior to its admission into evidence created unfair prejudice. See Fed. R. Evid. 403.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This argument, too, strikes us as insubstantial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted above, the tape itself was properly authenticated prior to its admission. Thereafter, several witnesses (mainly police officers) testified as to the identities of the speakers. Moreover, the officers whose voices were alleged to have been captured on the tape (Boulter among them) testified at trial; the jury thus had the opportunity to determine for itself who spoke which lines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we see no Rule 403 problem. The rule does not aspire to eliminate prejudice -- after all, most evidence is offered precisely because the proponent believes it will prejudice the factfinder in his favor -- but only to eliminate unfair prejudice. See, e.g., Veranda Beach Club Ltd. Partnership v. Western Sur. Co., 936 F.2d 1364, 1372 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 156 (1st Cir. 1989). Given the sound track's potentially significant probative value (especially in regard to Boulter's state of mind as it pertained to the section 1983 excessive force claim) and the absence of any unfairly prejudicial impact, we cannot fault the district court's overruling of Boulter's Rule 403 objection. See Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"Only rarely -- and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Qualified Immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 provides a private right of action against officials who, while acting under color of state law, deprive individuals of federally assured rights. But this kind of rights-violating conduct does not translate automatically into money damages, for a state actor may enjoy an immunity (absolute or qualified). In this instance, Boulter says that the lower court erred in failing to exonerate him based on the doctrine of qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Qualified immunity is a medium through which \"the law strives to balance its desire to compensate those whose rights are infringed by state actors with an equally compelling desire to shield public servants from undue interference with the performance of their duties and from threats of liability which, though unfounded, may nevertheless be unbearably disruptive.\" Buenrostro v. Collazo, 973 F.2d 39, 42 (1st Cir. 1992) (citing Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 806 (1982)). \"Hence, state officials exercising discretionary authority are entitled to qualified immunity insofar as their conduct does not transgress clearly established constitutional or federal statutory rights of which a reasonably prudent official should have been aware.\" Id. To ascertain a defendant's eligibility for such immunity, a court must inquire into the objective legal reasonableness of the defendant's actions, gauged in connection with the mosaic of legal rules that were clearly established when the defendant acted. See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 639 (1987). In operation, the outcome of this inquiry \"depends substantially upon the level of generality at which the relevant 'legal rule' is to be identified.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Iacobucci asserts that Boulter, a policeman acting under color of his official authority, lacked probable cause to arrest him and thereby violated his Fourth Amendment rights. In this wise, he observes that a citizen's right to be free from arrest in the absence of probable cause has long been clearly established. See, e.g., Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91 (1964). That observation sweeps so broadly, however, that it bears very little relationship to the objective legal reasonableness vel non of Boulter's harm-inducing conduct. See Wilson v. Layne, 119 S. Ct. 1692, 1699-1700 (1999). The \"right the official is alleged to have violated must have been 'clearly established' in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640. Our inquiry, then, reduces to whether a reasonable police officer, standing in Boulter's shoes, would have known that arresting Iacobucci for disorderly conduct, under all the attendant circumstances, would contravene clearly established law. That inquiry must proceed in light of the commonly held understanding that probable cause exists only if the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer's knowledge \"are sufficient to lead an ordinarily prudent officer to conclude that an offense has been, is being, or is about to be committed, and that the putative arrestee is involved in the crime's commission.\" Logue v. Dore, 103 F.3d 1040, 1044 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before wrestling with this question, we pause to voice some procedural concerns. Boulter first raised the issue of qualified immunity in a pretrial motion for summary judgment. Although he tries in this forum to assign error to the denial of that motion, a pair of procedural impediments frustrates the attempt. For one thing, an order denying summary judgment typically does not merge into the final judgment and therefore is not an independently appealable event if the case thereafter proceeds to trial. See Eastern Mountain Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., 40 F.3d 492, 497 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, in his notice of appeal, Boulter purported to challenge only the amended judgment entered by the district court on March 31, 1997 -- a decree sparked by the court's denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law. \"It is black-letter law that a notice of appeal must specify the order or judgment to which the appeal is addressed.\" Lehman v. Revolution Portfolio LLC, 166 F.3d 389, 395 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)). Boulter's failure to specify the order denying summary judgment in his notice of appeal thus bars his current attempt to contest the propriety of that ruling. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, the district court supportably concluded that Boulter's summary judgment motion did not seek to test the bona fides of the section 1983 false arrest claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding these infirmities, the qualified immunity issue is not a dead letter. Although qualified immunity normally should be resolved early in the litigation, see Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985), the defense, if preserved, may be pressed at later stages, including in a timeous post-trial motion. See, e.g., Consolo v. George, 58 F.3d 791, 794 (1st Cir. 1995). Because Boulter filed such a motion and now assigns error to its denial, the issue must be addressed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ordinary course, we review the district court's denial of qualified immunity de novo, aligning the evidence most favorably to the non-movant and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. See, e.g., Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos, 151 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1998); Amsden v. Moran, 904 F.2d 748, 752-53 (1st Cir. 1990). But this familiar formulation of the standard arises in connection with pretrial orders granting or denying qualified immunity, and Iacobucci maintains that the intervening trial and verdict pretermit (or, at least, reconfigure) the inquiry. He points out that when Boulter made the arrest, he charged Iacobucci with having committed two offenses: disorderly conduct and disturbing a public assembly. Iacobucci notes correctly that this charging decision circumscribes the inquiry into probable cause. Building on this foundation, he posits that we need not look beyond the verdict, in which the jury, answering a special interrogatory, found that no reasonable police officer would have believed that Iacobucci had committed either offense. Boulter resists this approach: he asserts that the jury's merits determination neither extinguishes nor bears upon his claim of entitlement to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, there is a middle ground. A state actor may be entitled to qualified immunity for rights-violating conduct as long as he had an objectively reasonable basis for believing that his conduct would not abridge the rights of others. See Camilo-Robles v. Zapata, 175 F.3d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 1999); Quintero de Quintero v. Aponte-Roque, 974 F.2d 226, 228 (1st Cir. 1992). This means, of course, that the reasonableness standards underlying the probable cause and qualified immunity inquiries are not coterminous. See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641. Thus, the jury's determination does not squarely answer the question whether Boulter's conduct in arresting Iacobucci satisfied the criterion of objective legal reasonableness so as to entitle him to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the procedural posture in which Boulter's appeal arises greatly influence the standard of review. When a qualified immunity defense is pressed after a jury verdict, the evidence must be construed in the light most hospitable to the party that prevailed at trial. See Thompson v. Mahre, 110 F.3d 716, 721 (9th Cir. 1997); Karnes v. Skrutski, 62 F.3d 485, 494 (3d Cir. 1995); Posr v. Doherty, 944 F.2d 91, 95-96 (2d Cir. 1991). One difference is that, in such an exercise, deference should be accorded to the jury's discernible resolution of disputed factual issues. See Frazell v. Flanigan, 102 F.3d 877, 886 (7th Cir. 1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this paradigm in mind, we turn to the facts. The first of the two charges on which Boulter arrested Iacobucci -- disorderly conduct -- implicated Mass. Gen. Laws c. 272, &#167; 53.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In pertinent part, the statute makes it a misdemeanor to be a \"disorderly person.\" To stave off constitutional attacks, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) originally construed section 53 to provide that one is guilty under that rubric</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . if, with purpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (a) engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior; or (b) makes unreasonable noise or offensively coarse utterance, gesture or display, or addresses abusive language to any person present; or (c) creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alegata v. Commonwealth, 231 N.E.2d 201, 211 (Mass. 1967) (quoting Proposed Official Draft of Model Penal Code &#167; 250.2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the next decade, the SJC narrowed this definition of disorderly conduct to encompass only activities not implicating the \"lawful exercise of a First Amendment right.\" Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, 334 N.E.2d 617, 628 (Mass. 1975). To ensure that result, the SJC modified its earlier definition by striking subsection (b) entirely and interpreting subsections (a) and (c) to cover only conduct, not expressive activity. See id. at 629. Consistent with this approach, the SJC subsequently held that a verbal challenge, even when coupled with a refusal to obey a police officer's orders, does not constitute disorderly conduct within the meaning of section 53 as long as done in furtherance of a legitimate purpose. See Commonwealth v. Feigenbaum, 536 N.E.2d 325, 328 (Mass. 1989). To this extent, then, the contours of the disorderly conduct statute were clearly visible when Boulter confronted Iacobucci at the Pembroke Town Hall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Context is important in police work, as elsewhere in human intercourse. Thus, upon being apprised of the ongoing events at the Town Hall, Boulter recognized that the circumstances required a reasonable police officer to take into account the Massachusetts Open Meeting Law, Mass. Gen. Laws c. 39, &#167; 23B, and he took steps to refresh his recollection of that enactment. The statute requires that \"[a]ll meetings of a governmental body . . . be open to the public,\" and confers a right to videotape such meetings on \"any person in attendance.\" The right to videotape is not unfettered: the camera must be \"fixed in one or more designated locations determined by the governmental body,\" and the taping may not actively interfere \"with the conduct of the meeting.\" Id. Withal, the statute does \"not apply to any chance meeting, or a social meeting at which matters relating to official business are discussed so long as no final agreement is reached.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this background, we are constrained to conclude that, taking the evidence in the light most flattering to Iacobucci, his constitutional right to act as he did without being arrested for disorderly conduct was \"sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would [have understood] that what he [was] doing violate[d] that right.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640; accord Wagenmann v. Adams, 829 F.2d 196, 209 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking first the events that transpired in the meeting room, we note that Iacobucci had satisfied the basic prerequisites for entitlement to videotape a public meeting under the Open Meeting Law: he had situated his tripod in the only stationary location that would allow the mounted camera to capture the faces of both the commissioners and the applicants and there is no significantly probative evidence that his activities interfered with the ongoing meeting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Indeed, his equipment had been placed in the very same location during prior Commission meetings, without incident. Moreover, after Hathon tired of trying to bully Iacobucci, the instant meeting proceeded without disruption and the Commission completed its business unimpeded by the filming. Iacobucci remained cool, calm, and collected throughout. Under the circumstances and in light of the clearly established law that obtained at the time of the incident, we agree with Judge Saris that an objectively reasonable officer would not have thought that Iacobucci was subject to arrest for disorderly conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking next the hallway episode, we find nothing whatever to suggest that Iacobucci was \"fighting or threatening,\" or was engaged in any \"violent or tumultuous behavior.\" A Juvenile, 334 N.E.2d at 628; see also Sheehy v. Plymouth, 191 F.3d 15, 22 (1st Cir. 1999) .  On any version of the events reflected in the record, no objectively reasonable police officer would have believed that Iacobucci had created a \"hazardous or physically offensive condition . . . which serve[d] no legitimate purpose.\" A Juvenile, 334 N.E.2d at 628. Even if the gathering was not a public meeting at that point, Iacobucci was doing nothing wrong: he was in a public area of a public building; he had a right to be there; he filmed the group from a comfortable remove; and he neither spoke to nor molested them in any way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter's repeated demands that Iacobucci cease recording do not change the disorderly conduct calculus. A police officer is not a law unto himself; he cannot give an order that has no colorable legal basis and then arrest a person who defies it. So it is here: because Iacobucci's activities were peaceful, not performed in derogation of any law, and done in the exercise of his First Amendment rights, Boulter lacked the authority to stop them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other ground of arrest fares no better under close scrutiny. That ground implicated Mass. Gen. Laws c. 272, &#167; 40, which makes it a misdemeanor to \"willfully interrupt[] or disturb[] a school or other assembly.\" As to the events that transpired in the meeting room, the record, read as it must be in the light most favorable to Iacobucci, contains no evidence that he \"interrupted or disturbed\" the Commission's meeting. See supra note 5 and accompanying text. As to the events that transpired in the hallway, Boulter was adamant in his insistence that the hallway gathering was not a public meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no point in flogging a dead horse. We conclude that the district court did not err in holding that Boulter's arrest of Iacobucci failed to attain the level of objective legal reasonableness. Hence, Boulter was not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. IACOBUCCI'S APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although voicing doubts about whether a satisfactory foundation for punitive damages had been laid, the district court prudently reserved judgment on that question and sent it to the jury. After the jurors awarded Iacobucci $75,000 in compensatory damages and $135,000 in punitive damages, Boulter moved for relief. Concluding that the evidence failed to warrant punitive damages, the district court struck that portion of the award (albeit leaving intact the compensatory damages). Iacobucci contests this ruling. We review the lower court's decision de novo, taking the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most congenial to the jury's verdict. See Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1188 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's approach accurately foretold that taken by the Supreme Court a few months later in Kolstad v. American Dental Ass'n, 119 S. Ct. 2118 (1999).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Punitive damages become a discretionary matter for the jury in a section 1983 action only if the plaintiff makes an adequate threshold showing. A plaintiff reaches that threshold when \"the defendant's conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.\" Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kolstad sheds considerable light on Smith and the circumstances under which a judge may permit a jury to consider a request for punitive damages in a civil rights case. The Smith standard, visualized through the Kolstad lens, confirms that there is a different focus for compensatory as opposed to punitive damages. See Kolstad, 119 S. Ct. at 2124. The special showing needed to trigger eligibility for punitive damages, which the Smith Court called \"evil motive\" or \"reckless or callous indifference,\" Smith, 461 U.S. at 56, pertains to the defendant's \"knowledge that [he] may be acting in violation of federal law, not [his] awareness that [he] is engaging in discrimination,\" Kolstad, 119 S. Ct. at 2124. Thus, the standard requires proof that the defendant acted \"in the face of a perceived risk that [his] actions [would] violate federal law.\" Id. at 2125. While \"egregious or outrageous acts may serve as evidence supporting an inference of the requisite 'evil motive,'\" the presence (or absence) of such acts does not in itself determine the propriety (or lack of propriety) of punitive damages in a given case. Id. at 2126.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make out a jury question on punitive damages under this subjectively oriented test, Iacobucci needed to adduce evidence sufficient to prove that Boulter arrested him in the face of a perceived risk that doing so would violate Iacobucci's federally assured rights. More specifically, Iacobucci needed to adduce evidence sufficient to show that Boulter determined to effectuate the arrest knowing that he lacked probable cause to do so, or, at least, with conscious indifference to the possibility that he lacked probable cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We realize that the district court instructed the jury to determine whether Boulter had acted intentionally or recklessly in arresting Iacobucci, and that the jury, by returning a plaintiff's verdict on the section 1983 false arrest claim, necessarily found that Boulter's conduct fit into that proscribed category. This mens rea finding, however, does not clear the way for punitive damages. The state of mind required to make out a cognizable section 1983 claim (at least one grounded in false arrest) differs importantly from that required to justify punitive damages. See Kolstad, 119 S. Ct. at 2124. The former requirement relates only to the conduct, not to the consequence; that is, it entails an intent to do the act, not to effect a civil rights violation. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this issue, the district court concluded that although Boulter made an objectively unreasonable split-second decision when he arrested Iacobucci, no evidence suggested that he harbored any malice or acted with reckless indifference to Iacobucci's constitutional rights. After carefully scrutinizing the record, we agree with this assessment. Viewed most favorably to Iacobucci, the evidence reveals that when apprised of the contretemps, Boulter called a selectman to get a better sense of the Open Meeting Law. Upon his arrival, he attempted to piece together a complete picture of the evening's events. He then made several attempts to defuse a contentious situation. Only after his attempted intercessions were rebuffed did he effect an arrest. This constellation of facts does not lend itself to the inference that Boulter acted with an evil motive or a conscious awareness that the arrest might violate Iacobucci's civil rights. Where, as here, the evidence shows no more than that an exasperated police officer, acting in the heat of the moment, made an objectively unreasonable mistake, punitive damages will not lie.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laboring to close this gap, Iacobucci suggests that the partially erased videotape contains evidence indicative of a state of mind conducive to punitive damages. He points to a statement contained therein from which (he says) the jury could have inferred that the videotape had been erased to provide cover against a potential excessive force claim. The jury, however, found for Boulter on the section 1983 excessive force count -- and the videotape contains nothing that bears on Boulter's motives in connection with the arrest. We conclude, therefore, that this evidence fails to lift the punitive damages issue into the realm of the jury's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, the district court acted appropriately in defenestrating the punitive damages award. The dearth of record evidence, direct or circumstantial, as to Boulter's evil motive and/or subjective awareness that he lacked probable cause to arrest Iacobucci suffices to defeat the claim for punitive damages as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. Precedent in this circuit had interpreted Smith to mean that in civil rights cases requiring proof of intentional wrongdoing, \"the state of mind necessary to trigger liability for the wrong is at least as culpable as that required to make punitive damages applicable.\" Rowlett v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 832 F.2d 194, 205 (1st Cir. 1987). Kolstad plainly rejects that interpretation. To the extent that Rowlett fails to draw a distinction between the state of mind requirement anent the actor's conduct and the state of mind requirement anent the effects of that conduct, it is no longer good law, and we disavow it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

Wade, 461 U.S. 30 (1983) (a seminal case on punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983). The Court therefore interpreted the relevant statutory terms in lockstep with its understanding of the parallel language in Smith. See Kolstad, 119 S. Ct. at 2124-25.

These cross-appeals require us to revisit the punitive damages threshold in light of Kolstad. After acquitting this responsibility and addressing other pertinent issues, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening of March 26, 1991, Richard Iacobucci, the plaintiff herein, visited the Pembroke Town Hall to videotape a scheduled meeting of the Pembroke Historic District Commission (the Commission). Such forays were mother's milk to Iacobucci, who intermittently filmed sessions of local boards, including the Commission, for a weekly news program that he produced and broadcast via a cable television outlet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the evening in question, the Commission's stated purpose was to review building applications. The commissioners sat along three sides of a four-sided conference table. As he had done in the past, Iacobucci positioned his tripod at the unoccupied end of the table. Soon after the meeting commenced, the chairman, Otis Hathon, twice asked Iacobucci to move his equipment across the room. Iacobucci declined, explaining that his view of the commissioners' and applicants' faces would be obstructed. Hathon did not suffer rejection gladly; at one point, he extinguished the lights, remarking: \"I hope your camera can see in the dark.\" When this petulance failed to sway Iacobucci, Hathon warned him of the possibility of arrest should he fail to move. That warning, too, fell on deaf ears, prompting a commissioner to alert the local constabulary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two Pembroke police officers, Flannery and Jenness, responded. They asked Iacobucci to turn off the camera and talk with them in the corridor. Iacobucci replied that he had a right to record the proceedings, that he intended to exercise it, and that he would not converse until the meeting ended. The stalemated officers called their superior, Sergeant Willard Boulter (the principal defendant herein).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The meeting adjourned before Sgt. Boulter arrived, presumably because the last applicant had not appeared. Iacobucci packed his gear. He then noticed the commissioners speaking in the hallway with a man carrying a set of plans. Believing that man to be the tardy applicant, Iacobucci retrieved his camera and began filming the group on the assumption that he was witnessing a de facto resumption of the adjourned meeting. Iacobucci persisted despite importunings from some of the commissioners to stop.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sgt. Boulter arrived at that juncture, stepped in front of the lens, and demanded that Iacobucci cease and desist. Iacobucci demurred, sidestepped adroitly, and resumed his journalistic endeavor. This pas de deux continued until Sgt. Boulter gave Iacobucci an ultimatum: sit down or be arrested. When Iacobucci kept filming, Boulter took the camera from him, grabbed his elbow, led him into another room, handcuffed him, and placed him under arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police transported Iacobucci to the station house and charged him with disorderly conduct and disrupting a public assembly. Iacobucci spent about four hours in custody before the authorities released him. When he reclaimed his camera, he discovered that the videotape no longer contained any images and that the sound track was barely audible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The criminal charges eventually were dismissed, but Iacobucci (a law school graduate, although not a practicing attorney) filed a pro se civil action that asserted a golconda of claims against numerous defendants. We need not dwell on the details, because pretrial proceedings winnowed the trialworthy issues to three claims pressed by Iacobucci against Boulter. These included claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 premised on false arrest and excessive force, respectively, and a state-law claim premised on intentional infliction of emotional distress. The three claims were tried to a jury, which found for Boulter on two of them. On the section 1983 false arrest claim, however, the jury sided with Iacobucci and awarded him $75,000 in compensatory damages and $135,000 in punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdict did not please Boulter. He renewed his earlier motion for judgment as a matter of law and asked, alternatively, for a new trial or for a remittitur. The district court struck the punitive damages, but otherwise denied Boulter's post-trial motions. Both parties now appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. BOULTER'S APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like all Gaul, Boulter's appeal is divided into three parts. He assails the district court's handling of the section 1983 false arrest claim because the court (1) should not have permitted the claim, if ever properly in the case, to go to trial; (2) improvidently admitted evidence that was both irrelevant and prejudicial; and (3) erred in rejecting a qualified immunity defense. We examine these asseverations seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Status of the Section 1983 False Arrest Claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The wrangling over this issue breaks down into two subsidiary questions: Was the section 1983 false arrest claim properly pled? If so, did it survive summary judgment? The district court answered both questions affirmatively. So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In narrowing the issues immediately prior to trial, a dispute arose concerning what claims were outstanding. Boulter considered only two claims to be zoetic: a section 1983 excessive force claim and a state-law claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. In contrast, Iacobucci took the position that a section 1983 false arrest claim also remained in the case. After reviewing the complaint and the summary judgment record, the lower court concluded that Iacobucci had adequately pled a section 1983 false arrest claim, and that this claim had not been addressed (let alone terminated) at the summary judgment stage. Consequently, the court allowed Iacobucci to litigate the claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" The complaint in this case satisfied that undemanding criterion vis-a-vis the section 1983 false arrest claim: it specifically alleged that Boulter, while acting under color of state law, violated Iacobucci's constitutional \"right to be secure in his person\" and \"wrongfully deprived him of his liberty.\" This language, coupled with a prayer for money damages, adequately stated a section 1983 false arrest claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, the claim could have been pled more clearly. Here, however, Boulter has not identified a scintilla of prejudice that may have resulted from any obscurity in the wording of the plaintiff's complaint, nor is any such prejudice readily apparent. The section 1983 false arrest claim arises out of the same nucleus of operative fact as the other two tried claims (both of which Boulter acknowledges were in the case all along), and the parties' discussions with the court immediately before the start of trial clarified any uncertainty about whether the section 1983 false arrest claim was to be litigated. The sockdolager is this: had prejudice loomed, Boulter could have asked the court for a continuance. His failure to do so leads ineluctably to the conclusion that any claim of unfairness that he now might assert is nothing more than a post hoc rationalization sparked by a verdict that was not to his liking. See Faigin v. Kelly, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198558\"><a href=\"/opinion/198558/faigin-v-kelly-carucci/\"><span class=\"volume\">184</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 85 (1st Cir. 1999) (explaining that \"a reviewing court may attribute special significance to the party's eschewal of a continuance and assume that the party did not require additional time to adjust his litigation strategy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We likewise reject Boulter's plaint that the section 1983 false arrest claim, even if pled, did not survive the district court's summary judgment order. In hawking this proposition, Boulter points to the concluding passage in the trial court's summary judgment ruling, in which Judge Saris stated: \"With respect to Sergeant Boulter, the motion is DENIED on the excessive force claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Otherwise it is ALLOWED.\" Boulter maintains that these final four words laid to rest any incipient section 1983 false arrest claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is too cute by half. It overlooks that Boulter's motion, which set the stage for the court's summary judgment ruling, never sought brevis disposition as to the section 1983 false arrest claim. Thus, when Boulter made this very argument below, the district court rejected it, explaining that the \"otherwise\" language spoke only to the claims that had been debated in the summary judgment papers -- and that the section 1983 false arrest claim was not among that number. A trial court ordinarily is the best expositor of its own orders, see United States v. Podolsky, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198158\"><a href=\"/opinion/198158/united-states-v-podolsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir. 1998); Martha's Vineyard Scuba Headquarters, Inc. v.

Because the district court reasonably interpreted its own order as not terminating the section 1983 false arrest claim, we honor its interpretation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. The Evidentiary Question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter next insists that the trial court erred in admitting the partially erased videotape into evidence. He bases this insistence on three grounds: lack of relevance, lack of a proper foundation, and undue prejudice. We review challenges to orders admitting or excluding evidence for abuse of discretion. See Faigin, 184 F.3d at 81 ; Williams v. Drake, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198058\"><a href=\"/opinion/198058/williams-v-drake/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 47 (1st Cir. 1998). We discern none here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts are these. The videotape itself had been erased by parties unknown (although Iacobucci understandably suspected the police). At any rate, the audio portion of the tape picked up after the time that the police took Iacobucci into custody. It apparently recorded contemporaneous conversations amongst Boulter and his fellow officers. Boulter's objection runs to the admissibility of those comments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter's first line of attack emphasizes the temporal sequence. He argues that an after-the-fact recording necessarily lacks relevance. This ipse dixit is simply wrong. Evidence of subsequent events frequently sheds light upon, and thus assumes relevance in relation to, antecedent acts. See United States v. Lara, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764882\"><a href=\"/opinion/764882/united-states-v-giovanni-lara-appellantno-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">183</span></a></span>, 204 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Sutton, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587576\"><a href=\"/opinion/587576/united-states-v-arthur-sutton/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1001</span></a></span>, 1007 (1st Cir. 1992); United States v. Mena, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"561243\"><a href=\"/opinion/561243/united-states-v-edward-ramon-mena/\"><span class=\"volume\">933</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 25 n.5 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the district court supportably determined that rational jurors might find that some of the statements made on the tape referred back to what had transpired at the time of the arrest. We recount a sampling in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Relevancy is a fluid concept under the Evidence Rules. See Fed. R. Evid. 401 (defining relevant evidence as \"having any tendency to make the existence\" of any material fact \"more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\"). Consequently, relevancy typically presents a rather low barrier to admissibility. See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Expressway Sewerage Constr., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198491\"><a href=\"/opinion/198491/fitzgerald-v-expressway-sewerage/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Saccoccia, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196165\"><a href=\"/opinion/196165/united-states-v-saccoccia/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 780 (1st Cir. 1995). Taking into account that the excessive force, emotional distress, and false arrest claims were being tried together, we conclude that Judge Saris acted within the encincture of her discretion in deciding that the challenged statements cleared this hurdle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter's second line of attack centers on his contention that the audio portion of the tape ought to have been excluded because Iacobucci's enhancement of it somehow destroyed the tape's integrity. This contention amounts to a claim that the evidence lacked a proper foundation. Such claims are committed to the trial judge's informed discretion. See United States v. Ladd, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529712\"><a href=\"/opinion/529712/united-states-v-gary-ladd/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span>, 956 (1st Cir. 1989); see also Fed. R. Evid. 901(a), 1001(2) &amp; 1002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter's contention trenches on the frivolous. Iacobucci testified to the chain of custody. He also testified that he did not alter the tape in any way, but, rather, enhanced the sound by the simple expedient of listening to it on a high-quality play-back system that increased its audibility. The judge (and the jury, for that matter) were free to credit this testimony, especially since Boulter offered no evidence to contradict it. No more was exigible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter's final line of attack postulates that the failure to identify the voices on the tape prior to its admission into evidence created unfair prejudice. See Fed. R.

Given the sound track's potentially significant probative value (especially in regard to Boulter's state of mind as it pertained to the section 1983 excessive force claim) and the absence of any unfairly prejudicial impact, we cannot fault the district court's overruling of Boulter's Rule 403 objection.

But this kind of rights-violating conduct does not translate automatically into money damages, for a state actor may enjoy an immunity (absolute or qualified).

To ascertain a defendant's eligibility for such immunity, a court must inquire into the objective legal reasonableness of the defendant's actions, gauged in connection with the mosaic of legal rules that were clearly established when the defendant acted. See Anderson v.

In this wise, he observes that a citizen's right to be free from arrest in the absence of probable cause has long been clearly established. See, e.g., Beck v. Ohio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106936\"><a href=\"/opinion/106936/beck-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 91 (1964). That observation sweeps so broadly, however, that it bears very little relationship to the objective legal reasonableness vel non of Boulter's harm-inducing conduct. See Wilson v. Layne, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118289\"><a href=\"/opinion/118289/wilson-v-layne/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The \"right the official is alleged to have violated must have been 'clearly established' in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640. Our inquiry, then, reduces to whether a reasonable police officer, standing in Boulter's shoes, would have known that arresting Iacobucci for disorderly conduct, under all the attendant circumstances, would contravene clearly established law. That inquiry must proceed in light of the commonly held understanding that probable cause exists only if the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer's knowledge \"are sufficient to lead an ordinarily prudent officer to conclude that an offense has been, is being, or is about to be committed, and that the putative arrestee is involved in the crime's commission.\" Logue v.

Boulter first raised the issue of qualified immunity in a pretrial motion for summary judgment. Although he tries in this forum to assign error to the denial of that motion, a pair of procedural impediments frustrates the attempt. For one thing, an order denying summary judgment typically does not merge into the final judgment and therefore is not an independently appealable event if the case thereafter proceeds to trial. See Eastern Mountain Platform Tennis, Inc. v. Sherwin-Williams Co., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682731\"><a href=\"/opinion/682731/eastern-mountain-platform-tennis-inc-v-the-sherwin-williams-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 497 (1st Cir. 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, in his notice of appeal, Boulter purported to challenge only the amended judgment entered by the district court on March 31, 1997 -- a decree sparked by the court's denial of his motion for judgment as a matter of law. \"It is black-letter law that a notice of appeal must specify the order or judgment to which the appeal is addressed.\" Lehman v. Revolution Portfolio LLC, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198303\"><a href=\"/opinion/198303/lehman-v-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 395 (1st Cir. 1999) (citing Fed. R. App. P. 3(c)). Boulter's failure to specify the order denying summary judgment in his notice of appeal thus bars his current attempt to contest the propriety of that ruling.

Although qualified immunity normally should be resolved early in the litigation, see Mitchell v. Forsyth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 526 (1985), the defense, if preserved, may be pressed at later stages, including in a timeous post-trial motion. See, e.g., Consolo v. George, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196170\"><a href=\"/opinion/196170/consolo-v-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 794 (1st Cir. 1995). Because Boulter filed such a motion and now assigns error to its denial, the issue must be addressed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the ordinary course, we review the district court's denial of qualified immunity de novo, aligning the evidence most favorably to the non-movant and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor. See, e.g., Camilo-Robles v. Hoyos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"756655\"><a href=\"/opinion/756655/grancid-camilo-robles-v-dr-guillermo-hoyos-and-dr-hector-o/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1998); Amsden v.

But this familiar formulation of the standard arises in connection with pretrial orders granting or denying qualified immunity, and Iacobucci maintains that the intervening trial and verdict pretermit (or, at least, reconfigure) the inquiry. He points out that when Boulter made the arrest, he charged Iacobucci with having committed two offenses: disorderly conduct and disturbing a public assembly. Iacobucci notes correctly that this charging decision circumscribes the inquiry into probable cause. Building on this foundation, he posits that we need not look beyond the verdict, in which the jury, answering a special interrogatory, found that no reasonable police officer would have believed that Iacobucci had committed either offense. Boulter resists this approach: he asserts that the jury's merits determination neither extinguishes nor bears upon his claim of entitlement to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not surprisingly, there is a middle ground. A state actor may be entitled to qualified immunity for rights-violating conduct as long as he had an objectively reasonable basis for believing that his conduct would not abridge the rights of others. See Camilo-Robles v. Zapata, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763555\"><a href=\"/opinion/763555/grancid-camilo-robles-v-jose-r-zapata-aka-jose-r-zapata-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir. 1999); Quintero de Quintero v.

This means, of course, that the reasonableness standards underlying the probable cause and qualified immunity inquiries are not coterminous. See Anderson, 483 U.S. at 641. Thus, the jury's determination does not squarely answer the question whether Boulter's conduct in arresting Iacobucci satisfied the criterion of objective legal reasonableness so as to entitle him to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor does the procedural posture in which Boulter's appeal arises greatly influence the standard of review. When a qualified immunity defense is pressed after a jury verdict, the evidence must be construed in the light most hospitable to the party that prevailed at trial. See Thompson v. Mahre, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739138\"><a href=\"/opinion/739138/97-cal-daily-op-serv-2551-97-daily-journal-dar-4501-jeri-lynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">716</span></a></span>, 721 (9th Cir. 1997); Karnes v.

One difference is that, in such an exercise, deference should be accorded to the jury's discernible resolution of disputed factual issues. See Frazell v.

The first of the two charges on which Boulter arrested Iacobucci -- disorderly conduct -- implicated Mass. Gen. Laws c. 272, &#167; 53.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In pertinent part, the statute makes it a misdemeanor to be a \"disorderly person.\" To stave off constitutional attacks, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) originally construed section 53 to provide that one is guilty under that rubric</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . if, with purpose to cause public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm, or recklessly creating a risk thereof, he: (a) engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior; or (b) makes unreasonable noise or offensively coarse utterance, gesture or display, or addresses abusive language to any person present; or (c) creates a hazardous or physically offensive condition by any act which serves no legitimate purpose of the actor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alegata v. Commonwealth, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></span>, 211 (Mass. 1967) (quoting Proposed Official Draft of Model Penal Code &#167; 250.2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the next decade, the SJC narrowed this definition of disorderly conduct to encompass only activities not implicating the \"lawful exercise of a First Amendment right.\" Commonwealth v. A Juvenile, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></span>, 628 (Mass. 1975). To ensure that result, the SJC modified its earlier definition by striking subsection (b) entirely and interpreting subsections (a) and (c) to cover only conduct, not expressive activity. See id. at 629. Consistent with this approach, the SJC subsequently held that a verbal challenge, even when coupled with a refusal to obey a police officer's orders, does not constitute disorderly conduct within the meaning of section 53 as long as done in furtherance of a legitimate purpose. See Commonwealth v. Feigenbaum, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">325</span></span>, 328 (Mass. 1989). To this extent, then, the contours of the disorderly conduct statute were clearly visible when Boulter confronted Iacobucci at the Pembroke Town Hall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Context is important in police work, as elsewhere in human intercourse. Thus, upon being apprised of the ongoing events at the Town Hall, Boulter recognized that the circumstances required a reasonable police officer to take into account the Massachusetts Open Meeting Law, Mass. Gen. Laws c. 39, &#167; 23B, and he took steps to refresh his recollection of that enactment. The statute requires that \"[a]ll meetings of a governmental body . . . be open to the public,\" and confers a right to videotape such meetings on \"any person in attendance.\" The right to videotape is not unfettered: the camera must be \"fixed in one or more designated locations determined by the governmental body,\" and the taping may not actively interfere \"with the conduct of the meeting.\" Id. Withal, the statute does \"not apply to any chance meeting, or a social meeting at which matters relating to official business are discussed so long as no final agreement is reached.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this background, we are constrained to conclude that, taking the evidence in the light most flattering to Iacobucci, his constitutional right to act as he did without being arrested for disorderly conduct was \"sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would [have understood] that what he [was] doing violate[d] that right.\" Anderson, 483 U.S. at 640; accord Wagenmann v. Adams, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494589\"><a href=\"/opinion/494589/ronald-e-wagenmann-v-russell-j-adams-appeal-of-gerald-r-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 209 (1st Cir. 1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking first the events that transpired in the meeting room, we note that Iacobucci had satisfied the basic prerequisites for entitlement to videotape a public meeting under the Open Meeting Law: he had situated his tripod in the only stationary location that would allow the mounted camera to capture the faces of both the commissioners and the applicants and there is no significantly probative evidence that his activities interfered with the ongoing meeting.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Indeed, his equipment had been placed in the very same location during prior Commission meetings, without incident. Moreover, after Hathon tired of trying to bully Iacobucci, the instant meeting proceeded without disruption and the Commission completed its business unimpeded by the filming. Iacobucci remained cool, calm, and collected throughout. Under the circumstances and in light of the clearly established law that obtained at the time of the incident, we agree with Judge Saris that an objectively reasonable officer would not have thought that Iacobucci was subject to arrest for disorderly conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking next the hallway episode, we find nothing whatever to suggest that Iacobucci was \"fighting or threatening,\" or was engaged in any \"violent or tumultuous behavior.\" A Juvenile, 334 N.E.2d at 628; see also Sheehy v. Plymouth, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198626\"><a href=\"/opinion/198626/sheehy-v-town-of-plymouth/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 22 (1st Cir. 1999) .  On any version of the events reflected in the record, no objectively reasonable police officer would have believed that Iacobucci had created a \"hazardous or physically offensive condition . . . which serve[d] no legitimate purpose.\" A Juvenile, 334 N.E.2d at 628. Even if the gathering was not a public meeting at that point, Iacobucci was doing nothing wrong: he was in a public area of a public building; he had a right to be there; he filmed the group from a comfortable remove; and he neither spoke to nor molested them in any way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boulter's repeated demands that Iacobucci cease recording do not change the disorderly conduct calculus. A police officer is not a law unto himself; he cannot give an order that has no colorable legal basis and then arrest a person who defies it. So it is here: because Iacobucci's activities were peaceful, not performed in derogation of any law, and done in the exercise of his First Amendment rights, Boulter lacked the authority to stop them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other ground of arrest fares no better under close scrutiny. That ground implicated Mass. Gen. Laws c. 272, &#167; 40, which makes it a misdemeanor to \"willfully interrupt[] or disturb[] a school or other assembly.\" As to the events that transpired in the meeting room, the record, read as it must be in the light most favorable to Iacobucci, contains no evidence that he \"interrupted or disturbed\" the Commission's meeting. See supra note 5 and accompanying text. As to the events that transpired in the hallway, Boulter was adamant in his insistence that the hallway gathering was not a public meeting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no point in flogging a dead horse. We conclude that the district court did not err in holding that Boulter's arrest of Iacobucci failed to attain the level of objective legal reasonableness. Hence, Boulter was not entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. IACOBUCCI'S APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although voicing doubts about whether a satisfactory foundation for punitive damages had been laid, the district court prudently reserved judgment on that question and sent it to the jury. After the jurors awarded Iacobucci $75,000 in compensatory damages and $135,000 in punitive damages, Boulter moved for relief. Concluding that the evidence failed to warrant punitive damages, the district court struck that portion of the award (albeit leaving intact the compensatory damages). Iacobucci contests this ruling. We review the lower court's decision de novo, taking the facts and the reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most congenial to the jury's verdict. See Correa v. Hospital San Francisco, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196369\"><a href=\"/opinion/196369/correa-gonzalez-v-hospital-sf/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1184</span></a></span>, 1188 (1st Cir. 1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's approach accurately foretold that taken by the Supreme Court a few months later in Kolstad v.

The special showing needed to trigger eligibility for punitive damages, which the Smith Court called \"evil motive\" or \"reckless or callous indifference,\" Smith, 461 U.S. at 56, pertains to the defendant's \"knowledge that [he] may be acting in violation of federal law, not [his] awareness that [he] is engaging in discrimination,\" Kolstad, 119 S. Ct. at 2124. Thus, the standard requires proof that the defendant acted \"in the face of a perceived risk that [his] actions [would] violate federal law.\" Id. at 2125. While \"egregious or outrageous acts may serve as evidence supporting an inference of the requisite 'evil motive,'\" the presence (or absence) of such acts does not in itself determine the propriety (or lack of propriety) of punitive damages in a given case. Id. at 2126.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To make out a jury question on punitive damages under this subjectively oriented test, Iacobucci needed to adduce evidence sufficient to prove that Boulter arrested him in the face of a perceived risk that doing so would violate Iacobucci's federally assured rights. More specifically, Iacobucci needed to adduce evidence sufficient to show that Boulter determined to effectuate the arrest knowing that he lacked probable cause to do so, or, at least, with conscious indifference to the possibility that he lacked probable cause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We realize that the district court instructed the jury to determine whether Boulter had acted intentionally or recklessly in arresting Iacobucci, and that the jury, by returning a plaintiff's verdict on the section 1983 false arrest claim, necessarily found that Boulter's conduct fit into that proscribed category. This mens rea finding, however, does not clear the way for punitive damages. The state of mind required to make out a cognizable section 1983 claim (at least one grounded in false arrest) differs importantly from that required to justify punitive damages. See Kolstad, 119 S. Ct. at 2124. The former requirement relates only to the conduct, not to the consequence; that is, it entails an intent to do the act, not to effect a civil rights violation. See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this issue, the district court concluded that although Boulter made an objectively unreasonable split-second decision when he arrested Iacobucci, no evidence suggested that he harbored any malice or acted with reckless indifference to Iacobucci's constitutional rights. After carefully scrutinizing the record, we agree with this assessment. Viewed most favorably to Iacobucci, the evidence reveals that when apprised of the contretemps, Boulter called a selectman to get a better sense of the Open Meeting Law. Upon his arrival, he attempted to piece together a complete picture of the evening's events. He then made several attempts to defuse a contentious situation. Only after his attempted intercessions were rebuffed did he effect an arrest. This constellation of facts does not lend itself to the inference that Boulter acted with an evil motive or a conscious awareness that the arrest might violate Iacobucci's civil rights. Where, as here, the evidence shows no more than that an exasperated police officer, acting in the heat of the moment, made an objectively unreasonable mistake, punitive damages will not lie.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Laboring to close this gap, Iacobucci suggests that the partially erased videotape contains evidence indicative of a state of mind conducive to punitive damages. He points to a statement contained therein from which (he says) the jury could have inferred that the videotape had been erased to provide cover against a potential excessive force claim. The jury, however, found for Boulter on the section 1983 excessive force count -- and the videotape contains nothing that bears on Boulter's motives in connection with the arrest. We conclude, therefore, that this evidence fails to lift the punitive damages issue into the realm of the jury's discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, the district court acted appropriately in defenestrating the punitive damages award. The dearth of record evidence, direct or circumstantial, as to Boulter's evil motive and/or subjective awareness that he lacked probable cause to arrest Iacobucci suffices to defeat the claim for punitive damages as a matter of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. Precedent in this circuit had interpreted Smith to mean that in civil rights cases requiring proof of intentional wrongdoing, \"the state of mind necessary to trigger liability for the wrong is at least as culpable as that required to make punitive damages applicable.\" Rowlett v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"496702\"><a href=\"/opinion/496702/melvin-k-rowlett-sr-v-anheuser-busch-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">832</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></a></span>, 205 (1st Cir. 1987). Kolstad plainly rejects that interpretation. To the extent that Rowlett fails to draw a distinction between the state of mind requirement anent the actor's conduct and the state of mind requirement anent the effects of that conduct, it is no longer good law, and we disavow it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons set forth above, we reject all three appeals and leave the parties where we found them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed. Each party to bear his own costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The sound track contained, inter alia, statements by various police officers, Boulter included, to the following effect:</p>\n        <p>-- \"Just what are you accusing me of doing here?\"</p>\n        <p>-- \"Ooh, erasing evidence?\"</p>\n        <p>-- \"Evidence of what?\"</p>\n        <p>-- \"Of police brutality.\"</p>\n        <p>-- \"If you call grabbing his f.....g elbow police brutality.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The rule provides:</p>\n        <p>Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>\n        <p>Fed. R. Evid. 403.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> To be sure, Iacobucci argues that Boulter waived the defense at this stage of the litigation. We need not probe the point too deeply. The district court addressed qualified immunity head-on in its post-trial rescript and we assume, for argument's sake, that no waiver transpired.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n        <p>Common night walkers, common street walkers, both male and female, common railers and brawlers, persons who with offensive and disorderly acts or language accost or annoy persons of the opposite sex, lewd, wanton and lascivious persons in speech or behavior, idle and disorderly persons, disturbers of the peace, keepers of noisy and disorderly houses, and persons guilty of indecent exposure may be punished [as provided by law].</p>\n        <p>Mass. Gen. Laws c. 272, &#167; 53.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Although the chairman did order Iacobucci to move the camera at some point after the meeting began, he did not designate an alternative location, and, in any event, the record evinces no reasonable basis for requiring relocation to a position that would nullify effective recording of the proceedings.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> It is no defense for Boulter to say that he believed the group was engaged in private conversation. Filming such a conversation on public property in pursuit of an indisputably legitimate purpose clearly was not disorderly conduct within the statutory definition. See Feigenbaum, 536 N.E.2d at 328; cf. Swerdlick v. Koch, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1508326\"><a href=\"/opinion/1508326/swerdlick-v-koch/\"><span class=\"volume\">721</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, 858 (R.I. 1998).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Kolstad Court examined the punitive damages provision found in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1981a(b)(1). At the outset of its analysis, the Court noted that when Congress drafted that provision, it modeled the language on that employed in Smith v. Wade, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110915\"><a href=\"/opinion/110915/smith-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span> (1983) (a seminal case on punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983). The Court therefore interpreted the relevant statutory terms in lockstep with its understanding of the parallel language in Smith. See Kolstad, 119 S. Ct. at 2124-25. Consequently, we believe that Kolstad's teachings are fully applicable to punitive damages under section 1983.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Our qualified immunity determination, see supra Part II(C), does not directly address this requirement. In assaying qualified immunity, we inquired into whether Boulter's presumed belief that probable cause existed was objectively reasonable. The focus of the punitive damages inquiry, however, is subjective.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
