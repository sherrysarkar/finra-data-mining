Leavey,\r                                                                             \r\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\r\n\n                                         \r\n\n                                         \r\n\n          Per Curiam.   Defendant-appellant Elizabeth  Mogaji\r                                \r\r\n\nwas convicted of  one count  of conspiracy  to commit  credit\r\n\ncard  fraud  and five  counts  of  fraudulent  use of  access\r\n\ndevices.  See 18 U.S.C.   1029(a)(2).  She raises a number of\r                         \r\n\nissues on appeal, all of them meritless.\r\n\n          1.  Motion to Suppress.\r                                            \r\n\n          Defendant  argues that  the  district court  should\r\n\nhave suppressed the contents of the two plastic bags found by\r\n\nPamela McCutcheon  and turned over to  Secret Service Special\r\n\nAgent James  Mooney.  The government  correctly responds that\r\n\ndefendant has no standing  to contest the search  because she\r\n\ndid not  have  a reasonable  expectation  of privacy  in  the\r\n\ncommon basement area of the  duplex at 10-12 Stamford Avenue;\r\n\nnor does the fact that defendant's driver's license was found\r\n\nin one of the bags  make a difference.  See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nThornley, 707  F.2d 622, 625  (1st Cir. 1983)  (defendant may\r                    \r\n\nnot protect himself against discovery of an item by taking it\r\n\nfrom his  own premises and hiding  it in a place  in which he\r\n\nhas no  legal interest).   Further, defendant did  not assert\r\n\nownership of anything in the plastic  bags at the suppression\r\n\nhearing  -- the time at which defendant must carry her burden\r\n\nof  showing a  privacy  expectation.   See  United States  v.\r                                                                     \r\n\nAguirre,  839  F.2d  854,  856  (1st  Cir.  1988).    Because\r                   \r\n\ndefendant plainly has  no standing to contest  the search, we\r\n\nneed not address defendant's credibility arguments. \r\n\n          2.  Judgment of Acquittal.\r                                               \r\n\n                             -3-\r\r\n\n          Defendant  argues  that   there  was   insufficient\r\n\nevidence  to find  her guilty  of any  of  the counts  in the\r\n\nindictment.  We will address these arguments by count, ending\r\n\nwith Count One, the conspiracy charge.  We review  challenges\r\n\nto the  sufficiency of  the evidence  to determine  whether a\r\n\nrational  jury could  find guilt  beyond a  reasonable doubt.\r\n\nUnited States v.  Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d  319, 323 (1st  Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1995).   In  so doing,  we examine  the evidence,  along with\r\n\nreasonable  inferences, in  the light  most favorable  to the\r\n\nprosecution.  Id.  The evidence may be circumstantial and the\r                             \r\n\nprosecution does not have  to exclude every reasonable theory\r\n\nof innocence.  United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14,\r                                                           \r\n\n17 (1st  Cir. 1991).  \"Furthermore, the  reviewing court does\r\n\nnot   evaluate   witness   credibility,   but   resolves  all\r\n\ncredibility issues in favor  of the verdict.\"  Flores-Rivera,\r                                                                        \r\n\n56 F.3d at 323.\r\n\n          The   above   principles  dispose   of  defendant's\r\n\nassertions that many of the witnesses lied on the stand.   We\r\n\nhave reviewed  the trial  transcript and conclude  that these\r\n\nchallenges go  instead to  the credibility of  the witnesses.\r\n\nAs  such, we will not  revisit the jury's  evaluation in this\r\n\nregard.  See id.\r                            \r\n\n              (a).  Count Two.   This count charges defendant\r                                         \r\n\nand Onyejekwe with using a Chase Manhattan Mastercard  in the\r\n\nname of Raymond Walters  to purchase two checks in  the total\r\n\n                             -4-\r\r\n\namount of $10,150  in violation of    1029(a)(2).   Defendant\r\n\nfirst argues  that  none of  the  exhibits submitted  by  the\r\n\ngovernment in relation to this charge showed that she had any\r\n\ninvolvement in procuring these checks.  However, defendant is\r\n\nbeing charged as part  of a conspiracy.  Under  the Pinkerton\r                                                                         \r\n\ndoctrine, Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640  (1946), a\r                                                \r\n\nmember of a conspiracy may be held liable for the substantive\r\n\ncrimes committed by co-conspirators if the substantive crimes\r\n\nwere  committed in  furtherance of  the conspiracy  and while\r\n\ndefendant was a member  of the conspiracy.  United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nFlores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 324.\r                         \r\n\n              We think that a  rational jury could have found\r\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Onyejekwe used the Raymond  P.\r\n\nWalters Mastercard in furtherance of the conspiracy and while\r\n\ndefendant  was  a  part  of  the  conspiracy.    First,  when\r\n\nOnyejekwe and defendant were  arrested for using a Mastercard\r\n\nin  the name of Beverly  Onofrio on July  10, 1991, Onyejekwe\r\n\nwas carrying a  list of names.  On  this list appeared names,\r\n\nbirth  dates  and addresses  for  both  Onofrio and  Walters.\r\n\nFurther, the use  of the Walters Mastercard occurred  in mid-\r\n\nMay  to  June of  1991  --  only a  month  prior  to the  two\r\n\noccasions on  which defendant and Onyejekwe  used the Onofrio\r\n\nMastercard at the Lechmere stores.  The jury could reasonably\r\n\ninfer, we think, that the use of both the Onofrio and Walters\r\n\nMastercards occurred as part of one conspiracy.\r\n\n                             -5-\r\r\n\n              Second,  we believe  the evidence  supports the\r\n\nconclusion that defendant was a participant in the conspiracy\r\n\nwhen Onyejekwe used  the Walters Mastercard.   The common law\r\n\nis  that one  who joins an  ongoing conspiracy,  as defendant\r\n\nplainly did  on July 6 and 10, \"is deemed to have adopted the\r\n\nprior acts and declarations of coconspirators, made after the\r\n\nformation  and in  furtherance  of the  conspiracy.\"   United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates  v.  Cintolo,  818  F.2d 980,  997  (1st  Cir.), cert.\r                                                                         \r\n\ndenied, 484 U.S. 913 (1987).  Given that the names of Walters\r                  \r\n\nand Onofrio appeared on  the list Onyejekwe was  carrying the\r\n\nday defendant was arrested,  there was sufficient evidence to\r\n\nconvict defendant on Count Two.  \r\n\n              (b).  Count Three.  This count concerns the use\r                                           \r\n\nof  Beverly Onofrio's  Mastercard at  the Lechmere  stores on\r\n\nJuly 6 and 10, in 1991.  Defendant first argues  that Exhibit\r\n\n#12, a photocopy  of a  Lechmere sales slip,  was altered  to\r\n\ninfluence the jury.   She contends that one order  number was\r\n\nwritten over  another and that the employee number, 1034, was\r\n\nhandwritten, when the  usual Lechmere custom  is to have  the\r\n\nemployee  number pre-stamped on the sales slip.  Looking at a\r\n\ncopy  of the  sales slip,  however, we  can discern  only one\r\n\norder  number  --  0061903.    As  for  the  writing  of  the\r\n\nemployee's  number, there is  nothing to  support defendant's\r\n\nassertion  that Lechmere's  \"usual  practice\" was  to have  a\r\n\nprinted number.\r\n\n                             -6-\r\r\n\n              Defendant next attacks the photo identification\r\n\nprocedure  by which Alex Shtutin -- the Lechmere sales person\r\n\nwho sold the  telefax machines to defendant  and Onyejekwe on\r\n\nJuly 6 --  identified defendant.   However, as far as  we can\r\n\ntell, defendant  never filed a  motion to suppress  the photo\r\n\nidentification  prior to  trial;  in fact,  she did  not even\r\n\nobject  to Shtutin's testimony at  trial.  We  have held that\r\n\npretrial photo identification  procedures are subject to  the\r\n\nrequirements of  Fed. R.  Crim. P.  12(b)(3)  and motions  to\r\n\nexclude  such evidence must be  made prior to  trial.  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v. Gomez-Benabe, 985 F.2d 607, 611-12 (1st Cir. 1993).\r                                  \r\n\nGiven Gomez-Benabe,  we think  that defendant, by  not having\r                              \r\n\ngiven  the district court a chance to determine if she should\r\n\nbe excused  from filing  a pretrial  motion to  suppress, has\r\n\nwaived her right to challenge the identification procedure on\r\n\nappeal.\r\n\n              (c).    Counts Four  and  Five.   These  counts\r                                                        \r\n\nconcern, respectively,  the use  of  Onofrio's Discover  Card\r\n\nduring June 21, 1991  through June 25, 1991,  and the use  of\r\n\nOnofrio's  AT&amp;T Universal  Mastercard  during  June 26,  1991\r\n\nthrough July 24, 1991.  Defendant correctly notes, as she did\r\n\nwith  respect to Count Two, that there was no direct evidence\r\n\nthat she ever used  either card.  Thus, under  Pinkerton, the\r                                                                    \r\n\ngovernment was required to prove that the use of the Discover\r\n\nCard  and the  AT&amp;T Universal  Mastercard, during  the period\r\n\n                             -7-\r\r\n\nfrom  June 21,  1991  to July  24, 1991,  was carried  out by\r\n\nOnyejekwe   in  furtherance  of   the  conspiracy  and  while\r\n\ndefendant was involved in the conspiracy.  See Flores-Rivera,\r                                                                        \r\n\n56 F.3d at 324.\r\n\n              In regard  to Count Four, the  evidence is that\r\n\nthe Discover Card was found in Onyejekwe's possession when he\r\n\nwas arrested on  July 10, and that Onofrio's  name was on the\r\n\nlist of names Onyejekwe was carrying.   Defendant argues that\r\n\nshe was in the hospital during the time the Discover Card was\r\n\nused.   However, absent any claim that she had withdrawn from\r\n\nthe conspiracy,  the fact  that defendant was  somewhere else\r\n\nduring  her co-conspirator's  actions is  not relevant.   See\r                                                                         \r\n\nUnited States  v. Juodakis,  834  F.2d 1099,  1102 (1st  Cir.\r                                      \r\n\n1987) (per curiam).  Cessation of activity in a conspiracy is\r\n\nnot  enough to  show withdrawal;  rather, a  conspirator must\r\n\ntake some  affirmative  act  such as  a  full  confession  to\r\n\nauthorities or a communication to a co-conspirator that he or\r\n\nshe  is withdrawing from the enterprise.  Id.  Defendant does\r                                                         \r\n\nnot allege the existence of such circumstances here.\r\n\n              As for  Count Five,  defendant points  out that\r\n\nthe AT&amp;T Universal Mastercard never  was recovered.  She also\r\n\nargues that there is no evidence connecting her to the use of\r\n\nthe  AT&amp;T card.   We  do not  think that  either ground  is a\r\n\nsufficient  basis on  which to  overturn the  jury's verdict.\r\n\nFirst, the question  is not only  whether defendant used  the\r                                       \r\n\n                             -8-\r\r\n\nAT&amp;T card, but also whether Onyejekwe might have used it.  In\r                                                 \r\n\nthis regard,  we note that the  AT&amp;T card was  applied for in\r\n\nJune 1991 and was  used during the same period  defendant and\r\n\nOnyejekwe  were  using the  other  cards  in Onofrio's  name.\r\n\nBecause  the  evidence  linking   Onyejekwe  to  the  use  of\r\n\nOnofrio's  name  is  so  strong,  we  think  that   the  jury\r\n\nrationally  could find  that  Onyejekwe  used Onofrio's  AT&amp;T\r\n\nUniversal Mastercard.\r\n\n              (d).  Count Six.   This count charged defendant\r                                         \r\n\nwith using a Mastercard  in the names of Leonard  L. Medeiros\r\n\nand  Althea  V. Medeiros  to  withdraw  money from  automated\r\n\nteller  machines.   The government's  evidence  consisted, in\r\n\npart, of photographs  of the person  who withdrew money  with\r\n\nthe  card in question.  McCutcheon had testified that she had\r\n\nrented  half of the duplex  at 10 Stamford  Ave. to defendant\r\n\nwho told McCutcheon that she (defendant) was Althea Medeiros.\r\n\nMcCutcheon identified defendant as the person in the picture.\r\n\n              Defendant  argues  that the  photographs should\r\n\nnot  have  been admitted  in evidence  because they  were too\r\n\nblurry for identification  purposes.  As a result,  she adds,\r\n\nMcCutcheon's identification of her  was suspect.  However, as\r\n\nwith the other photo  identification, defendant never filed a\r\n\nmotion  to  suppress the  photographs.    Therefore, she  has\r\n\nwaived an appellate challenge to them.  See Gomez-Benabe, 985\r                                                                    \r\n\nF.2d  at  611-12.     In  any  event,  defendant's  arguments\r\n\n                             -9-\r\r\n\nconcerning McCutcheon's testimony  really go to  credibility.\r\n\nThus, we need not  review her claims.  See  Flores-Rivera, 56\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d at 323.\r\n\n              (e).   Count One.  Count  one charged defendant\r                                          \r\n\nwith conspiracy to commit credit card fraud.  Defendant makes\r\n\nsome  of the same arguments in support of her contention that\r\n\nthe government failed  to show a  conspiracy between her  and\r\n\nOnyejekwe as  she made in regard to Counts Two and Four.  For\r\n\nthe  reasons stated  in the  discussion regarding  Count Two,\r\n\ndefendant's arguments,  first, that  the acts in  Counts Two,\r\n\nFour and Five  took place prior to July 10  and, second, that\r\n\nshe  only was present in the  Lechmere parking lot on July 10\r\n\nfail.  Similarly unavailing are the arguments that there  was\r\n\nno  evidence that defendant ever used a credit card or helped\r\n\nOnyejekwe use a  credit card,  that defendant's  fingerprints\r\n\nwere not found on any cards, and that no cards  were found on\r\n\nher person.   Under  Pinkerton, defendant is  responsible for\r                                          \r\n\nthe reasonably foreseeable offenses committed by Onyejekwe in\r\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy  since she was a member  of the\r\n\nconspiracy  during the  relevant time  periods.   See Flores-\r                                                                         \r\n\nRivera, 56 F.3d at 324.  The uses of the various credit cards\r                  \r\n\nby Onyejekwe clearly were foreseeable.  \r\n\n          3.  Denial of Cross-Examination.\r                                                     \r\n\n          Defendant argues  that on three  occasions she  was\r\n\nprevented from conducting  cross-examination that would  have\r\n\n                             -10-\r\r\n\nrevealed the biases and  perjured testimony of the witnesses.\r\n\nHowever,  a  review  of  the transcript  shows  that  counsel\r\n\ndecided to  withdraw the questions to  which defendant refers\r\n\nand that there  is no evidence  that either the court  or the\r\n\ngovernment \"prevented\" defendant from cross-examining anyone.\r\n\nThus,  this issue,  being  fact-based, must  be raised  as an\r\n\nineffective assistance claim  in a motion  under 28 U.S.C.   \r\n\n2255.   See United  States v.  Georgacarakos, 988  F.2d 1289,\r                                                        \r\n\n1297 (1st  Cir. 1993)  (an ineffective assistance  of counsel\r\n\nclaim which involves issues not fully  developed in the trial\r\n\nrecord is  not ripe for  decision on  appeal).  For  the same\r\n\nreason,  we  will  not consider  defendant's  other arguments\r\n\nrelating to allegedly ineffective assistance of counsel.\r\n\n          4.  Improper Jury Instruction.\r                                                   \r\n\n          Defendant complains that the trial  judge failed to\r\n\ninstruct  the jury  that    1029 requires  the  government to\r\n\nprove  that she  \"actually  used\" an  unauthorized device  to\r\n\nobtain something of value.   Because defendant never objected\r\n\nbelow,  we  review for  plain error.    See United  States v.\r                                                                      \r\n\nMcGill,   952  F.2d  16,  17  (1st  Cir.  1991).    The  jury\r                  \r\n\ninstructions plainly  reveal that  the trial  judge correctly\r\n\ninstructed the jury that, as Pinkerton holds, defendant could\r                                                  \r\n\nbe found guilty of fraudulent use of an access  device if the\r\n\njury found  that another's use of  such a device  was part of\r\n\nthe conspiracy,  that such  use was a  reasonably foreseeable\r\n\n                             -11-\r\r\n\nconsequence  of  the conspiracy,  and  that  defendant was  a\r\n\nmember of  the conspiracy  when the  device was used.   As  a\r\n\nresult, there was no plain error.\r\n\n          Defendant's second argument is that the trial judge\r\n\nimproperly used the word \"conspirators\" in reciting the overt\r\n\nacts charged in the indictment.  Essentially, the trial judge\r\n\nsubstituted  the  word  \"conspirators\"  for  the  words  \"the\r\n\ndefendants,  Christopher  Onyejekwe  and  Elizabeth  Mogaji.\"\r\n\nThus, as to the first overt act, the judge stated that \"on or\r\n\nabout  July 6,  1991,  conspirators purchased  merchandise at\r                                               \r\n\nLechmere. . . .\"  Defendant alleges that this communicated to\r\n\nthe  jury  the trial  judge's  belief  that she  was  guilty.\r\n\nAgain, there is no plain  error here.  The trial  court judge\r\n\ninstructed  the jury  that the  indictment was  not proof  of\r\n\nanything and clearly defined what elements were necessary for\r\n\nthe jury to  find that  defendant was part  of a  conspiracy.\r\n\nThe judge also  instructed the  jury that he  had no  opinion\r\n\nconcerning the facts.\r\n\n          5.  Motion to Recuse.\r                                          \r\n\n          Defendant argues that Judge Boyle, the trial judge,\r\n\nshould have  recused himself  due to  his bias  and prejudice\r\n\nagainst defendant.  She  claims that he was convinced  of her\r\n\nguilt  from the beginning.   This claim, in  part, arose when\r\n\ndefendant and her lawyer allegedly heard Judge Boyle state at\r\n\na bail  reconsideration hearing that there  \"was a conspiracy\r\n\n                             -12-\r\r\n\namong you people.\"  Defendant also rests her recusal argument\r\n\non  Judge  Boyle's post-trial  threat  that  he would  strike\r\n\ndefense counsel's name from the court-appointment list.\r\n\n          As for the first comment, it does not appear in the\r\n\ntranscript of the bail reconsideration hearing.  Further, the\r\n\ncourt  reporter  reviewed  the  tape recording  of  the  bail\r\n\nreconsideration   hearing   and  verified   the  transcript's\r\n\nauthenticity.  In any event, defendant has  waived this issue\r\n\nby waiting until after trial  to file a motion  for  recusal.\r                                  \r\n\nSee  In re Abijue Realty  Corp., 943 F.2d  121, 126 (1st Cir.\r                                           \r\n\n1991) (a  litigant, knowing  of a ground  for recusal  cannot\r\n\nwait  and  decide whether  he  or  she likes  the  subsequent\r\n\ntreatment he or she receives).\r\n\n          The second  comment, unlike the first,  is not even\r\n\ndirected at defendant.  Further, a reading of  the transcript\r\n\nreveals  that this  apparently  was the  second time  defense\r\n\ncounsel was  unprepared to go forward on a matter.  We do not\r\n\nthink  that  this   comment  provides  what   \"an  objective,\r\n\nknowledgeable  member  of  the  public  would find  to  be  a\r\n\nreasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality.\"  See\r                                                                         \r\n\nIn  re United  States,  666 F.2d  690,  695 (1st  Cir.  1981)\r                                 \r\n\n(stating the  applicable standard under 28  U.S.C.   455(a)).\r\n\nSimply, judicial  expressions of vexation at  lawyers who are\r\n\nnot  ready to  proceed on  time do  not  raise a  question of\r\n\njudicial bias.\r\n\n                             -13-\r\r\n\n          6.  Motion for a New Trial.\r                                                \r\n\n          In her recitation of the facts,  defendant mentions\r\n\nthat the district court denied her  motion for a new trial as\r\n\nuntimely.  However,  she fails  to include in  her brief  any\r\n\nargument  why we  should  reverse the  trial court's  ruling.\r                    \r\n\nThus,  she  has waived  the  issue.   A review  of  the issue\r\n\nnonetheless shows that this claim is meritless.\r\n\n          Defendant  was convicted  on May  10, 1994  and the\r\n\ncertificate of service of the new trial motion was dated July\r\n\n6, 1994.  Fed. R.  Crim. P. 33 requires  such a motion to  be\r\n\nfiled within seven days after verdict.  At the hearing on the\r\n\nmotion,  defendant's  trial  attorney stated  that  defendant\r\n\nnever had asked him to file a motion for a new trial.   Judge\r\n\nBoyle concluded that defendant had been confused over how one\r\n\nobtains a new  trial -- by a  motion or an appeal  -- and had\r\n\nasked  her attorney  to file  an appeal.   In any  event, the\r                                                   \r\n\nuntimeliness  of  the  motion  for  a  new trial,  a  finding\r\n\nsupported  by the  evidence, means  that the trial  court was\r\n\nwithout jurisdiction to rule  on it.

Lema,\r                                                                        \r\n\n909 F.2d 561, 565 (1st Cir. 1990).\r\n\n          The judgment of conviction is affirmed.\r                                                            \r\n\n                             -14-\r\r\n",

She raises a number of issues on appeal, all of them meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. Motion to Suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the district court should have suppressed the contents of the two plastic bags found by Pamela McCutcheon and turned over to Secret Service Special Agent James Mooney.   The government correctly responds that defendant has no standing to contest the search because she did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the common basement area of the duplex at 10-12 Stamford Avenue;  nor does the fact that defendant's driver's license was found in one of the bags make a difference.  See United States v. Thornley, 707 F.2d 622, 625 (1st Cir.1983) (defendant may not protect himself against discovery of an item by taking it from his own premises and hiding it in a place in which he has no legal interest).   Further, defendant did not assert ownership of anything in the plastic bags at the suppression hearing--the time at which defendant must carry her burden of showing a privacy expectation.  See United States v. Aguirre, 839 F.2d 854, 856 (1st Cir.1988).   Because defendant plainly has no standing to contest the search, we need not address defendant's credibility arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.

We will address these arguments by count, ending with Count One, the conspiracy charge.   We review challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence to determine whether a rational jury could find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 323 (1st Cir.1995).   In so doing, we examine the evidence, along with reasonable inferences, in the light most favorable to the prosecution.   Id. The evidence may be circumstantial and the prosecution does not have to exclude every reasonable theory of innocence.  United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1991).  \"Furthermore, the reviewing court does not evaluate witness credibility, but resolves all credibility issues in favor of the verdict.\"  Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 323.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The above principles dispose of defendant's assertions that many of the witnesses lied on the stand.   We have reviewed the trial transcript and conclude that these challenges go instead to the credibility of the witnesses.   As such, we will not revisit the jury's evaluation in this regard.   See id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a). Count Two.  This count charges defendant and Onyejekwe with using a Chase Manhattan Mastercard in the name of Raymond Walters to purchase two checks in the total amount of $10,150 in violation of &#167; 1029(a)(2).   Defendant first argues that none of the exhibits submitted by the government in relation to this charge showed that she had any involvement in procuring these checks.   However, defendant is being charged as part of a conspiracy.   Under the Pinkerton doctrine, Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946), a member of a conspiracy may be held liable for the substantive crimes committed by co-conspirators if the substantive crimes were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and while defendant was a member of the conspiracy.  United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 324.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Onyejekwe used the Raymond P. Walters Mastercard in furtherance of the conspiracy and while defendant was a part of the conspiracy.   First, when Onyejekwe and defendant were arrested for using a Mastercard in the name of Beverly Onofrio on July 10, 1991, Onyejekwe was carrying a list of names.   On this list appeared names, birth dates and addresses for both Onofrio and Walters.   Further, the use of the Walters Mastercard occurred in mid-May to June of 1991--only a month prior to the two occasions on which defendant and Onyejekwe used the Onofrio Mastercard at the Lechmere stores.   The jury could reasonably infer, we think, that the use of both the Onofrio and Walters Mastercards occurred as part of one conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we believe the evidence supports the conclusion that defendant was a participant in the conspiracy when Onyejekwe used the Walters Mastercard.   The common law is that one who joins an ongoing conspiracy, as defendant plainly did on July 6 and 10, \"is deemed to have adopted the prior acts and declarations of coconspirators, made after the formation and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"  United States v. Cintolo, 818 F.2d 980, 997 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 913 (1987).   Given that the names of Walters and Onofrio appeared on the list Onyejekwe was carrying the day defendant was arrested, there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant on Count Two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b). Count Three.   This count concerns the use of Beverly Onofrio's Mastercard at the Lechmere stores on July 6 and 10, in 1991.   Defendant first argues that Exhibit # 12, a photocopy of a Lechmere sales slip, was altered to influence the jury.   She contends that one order number was written over another and that the employee number, 1034, was handwritten, when the usual Lechmere custom is to have the employee number pre-stamped on the sales slip.   Looking at a copy of the sales slip, however, we can discern only one order number--0061903.   As for the writing of the employee's number, there is nothing to support defendant's assertion that Lechmere's \"usual practice\" was to have a printed number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant next attacks the photo identification procedure by which Alex Shtutin--the Lechmere sales person who sold the telefax machines to defendant and Onyejekwe on July 6--identified defendant.   However, as far as we can tell, defendant never filed a motion to suppress the photo identification prior to trial;  in fact, she did not even object to Shtutin's testimony at trial.   We have held that pretrial photo identification procedures are subject to the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3) and motions to exclude such evidence must be made prior to trial.  United States v. Gomez-Benabe, 985 F.2d 607, 611-12 (1st Cir.1993).   Given Gomez-Benabe, we think that defendant, by not having given the district court a chance to determine if she should be excused from filing a pretrial motion to suppress, has waived her right to challenge the identification procedure on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c). Counts Four and Five.  These counts concern, respectively, the use of Onofrio's Discover Card during June 21, 1991 through June 25, 1991, and the use of Onofrio's AT &amp; T Universal Mastercard during June 26, 1991 through July 24, 1991.   Defendant correctly notes, as she did with respect to Count Two, that there was no direct evidence that she ever used either card.   Thus, under Pinkerton, the government was required to prove that the use of the Discover Card and the AT &amp; T Universal Mastercard, during the period from June 21, 1991 to July 24, 1991, was carried out by Onyejekwe in furtherance of the conspiracy and while defendant was involved in the conspiracy.  See Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 324.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to Count Four, the evidence is that the Discover Card was found in Onyejekwe's possession when he was arrested on July 10, and that Onofrio's name was on the list of names Onyejekwe was carrying.   Defendant argues that she was in the hospital during the time the Discover Card was used.   However, absent any claim that she had withdrawn from the conspiracy, the fact that defendant was somewhere else during her co-conspirator's actions is not relevant.  See United States v. Juodakis, 834 F.2d 1099, 1102 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam).   Cessation of activity in a conspiracy is not enough to show withdrawal;  rather, a conspirator must take some affirmative act such as a full confession to authorities or a communication to a co-conspirator that he or she is withdrawing from the enterprise.   Id. Defendant does not allege the existence of such circumstances here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Count Five, defendant points out that the AT &amp; T Universal Mastercard never was recovered.   She also argues that there is no evidence connecting her to the use of the AT &amp; T card.   We do not think that either ground is a sufficient basis on which to overturn the jury's verdict.   First, the question is not only whether defendant used the AT &amp; T card, but also whether Onyejekwe might have used it.   In this regard, we note that the AT &amp; T card was applied for in June 1991 and was used during the same period defendant and Onyejekwe were using the other cards in Onofrio's name.   Because the evidence linking Onyejekwe to the use of Onofrio's name is so strong, we think that the jury rationally could find that Onyejekwe used Onofrio's AT &amp; T Universal Mastercard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d). Count Six.  This count charged defendant with using a Mastercard in the names of Leonard L. Medeiros and Althea V. Medeiros to withdraw money from automated teller machines.   The government's evidence consisted, in part, of photographs of the person who withdrew money with the card in question.   McCutcheon had testified that she had rented half of the duplex at 10 Stamford Ave. to defendant who told McCutcheon that she (defendant) was Althea Medeiros.   McCutcheon identified defendant as the person in the picture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the photographs should not have been admitted in evidence because they were too blurry for identification purposes.   As a result, she adds, McCutcheon's identification of her was suspect.   However, as with the other photo identification, defendant never filed a motion to suppress the photographs.   Therefore, she has waived an appellate challenge to them.  See Gomez-Benabe, 985 F.2d at 611-12.   In any event, defendant's arguments concerning McCutcheon's testimony really go to credibility.   Thus, we need not review her claims.  See Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 323.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e). Count One.  Count one charged defendant with conspiracy to commit credit card fraud.   Defendant makes some of the same arguments in support of her contention that the government failed to show a conspiracy between her and Onyejekwe as she made in regard to Counts Two and Four.  For the reasons stated in the discussion regarding Count Two, defendant's arguments, first, that the acts in Counts Two, Four and Five took place prior to July 10 and, second, that she only was present in the Lechmere parking lot on July 10 fail.   Similarly unavailing are the arguments that there was no evidence that defendant ever used a credit card or helped Onyejekwe use a credit card, that defendant's fingerprints were not found on any cards, and that no cards were found on her person.   Under Pinkerton, defendant is responsible for the reasonably foreseeable offenses committed by Onyejekwe in furtherance of the conspiracy since she was a member of the conspiracy during the relevant time periods.  See Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 324.   The uses of the various credit cards by Onyejekwe clearly were foreseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Denial of Cross-Examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that on three occasions she was prevented from conducting cross-examination that would have revealed the biases and perjured testimony of the witnesses.   However, a review of the transcript shows that counsel decided to withdraw the questions to which defendant refers and that there is no evidence that either the court or the government \"prevented\" defendant from cross-examining anyone.   Thus, this issue, being fact-based, must be raised as an ineffective assistance claim in a motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.  See United States v. Georgacarakos, 988 F.2d 1289, 1297 (1st Cir.1993) (an ineffective assistance of counsel claim which involves issues not fully developed in the trial record is not ripe for decision on appeal).   For the same reason, we will not consider defendant's other arguments relating to allegedly ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Improper Jury Instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant complains that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that &#167; 1029 requires the government to prove that she \"actually used\" an unauthorized device to obtain something of value.   Because defendant never objected below, we review for plain error.  See United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16, 17 (1st Cir.1991).   The jury instructions plainly reveal that the trial judge correctly instructed the jury that, as Pinkerton holds, defendant could be found guilty of fraudulent use of an access device if the jury found that another's use of such a device was part of the conspiracy, that such use was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy, and that defendant was a member of the conspiracy when the device was used.   As a result, there was no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's second argument is that the trial judge improperly used the word \"conspirators\" in reciting the overt acts charged in the indictment.   Essentially, the trial judge substituted the word \"conspirators\" for the words \"the defendants, Christopher Onyejekwe and Elizabeth Mogaji.\"   Thus, as to the first overt act, the judge stated that \"on or about July 6, 1991, conspirators purchased merchandise at Lechmere....\"  Defendant alleges that this communicated to the jury the trial judge's belief that she was guilty.   Again, there is no plain error here.   The trial court judge instructed the jury that the indictment was not proof of anything and clearly defined what elements were necessary for the jury to find that defendant was part of a conspiracy.   The judge also instructed the jury that he had no opinion concerning the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5. Motion to Recuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that Judge Boyle, the trial judge, should have recused himself due to his bias and prejudice against defendant.   She claims that he was convinced of her guilt from the beginning.   This claim, in part, arose when defendant and her lawyer allegedly heard Judge Boyle state at a bail reconsideration hearing that there \"was a conspiracy among you people.\"   Defendant also rests her recusal argument on Judge Boyle's post-trial threat that he would strike defense counsel's name from the court-appointment list.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the first comment, it does not appear in the transcript of the bail reconsideration hearing.   Further, the court reporter reviewed the tape recording of the bail reconsideration hearing and verified the transcript's authenticity.   In any event, defendant has waived this issue by waiting until after trial to file a motion for recusal.  See In re Abijue Realty Corp., 943 F.2d 121, 126 (1st Cir.1991) (a litigant, knowing of a ground for recusal cannot wait and decide whether he or she likes the subsequent treatment he or she receives).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second comment, unlike the first, is not even directed at defendant.   Further, a reading of the transcript reveals that this apparently was the second time defense counsel was unprepared to go forward on a matter.   We do not think that this comment provides what \"an objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to be a reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality.\"   See In re United States, 666 F.2d 690, 695 (1st Cir.1981) (stating the applicable standard under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a)).   Simply, judicial expressions of vexation at lawyers who are not ready to proceed on time do not raise a question of judicial bias.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6.

However, she fails to include in her brief any argument why we should reverse the trial court's ruling.   Thus, she has waived the issue.   A review of the issue nonetheless shows that this claim is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was convicted on May 10, 1994 and the certificate of service of the new trial motion was dated July 6, 1994.   Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 requires such a motion to be filed within seven days after verdict.   At the hearing on the motion, defendant's trial attorney stated that defendant never had asked him to file a motion for a new trial.   Judge Boyle concluded that defendant had been confused over how one obtains a new trial--by a motion or an appeal--and had asked her attorney to file an appeal.   In any event, the untimeliness of the motion for a new trial, a finding supported by the evidence, means that the trial court was without jurisdiction to rule on it.  United States v.

The government correctly responds that defendant has no standing to contest the search because she did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the common basement area of the duplex at 10-12 Stamford Avenue;  nor does the fact that defendant's driver's license was found in one of the bags make a difference.  See United States v. Thornley, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418706\"><a href=\"/opinion/418706/united-states-v-ronald-thornley/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 625 (1st Cir.1983) (defendant may not protect himself against discovery of an item by taking it from his own premises and hiding it in a place in which he has no legal interest).   Further, defendant did not assert ownership of anything in the plastic bags at the suppression hearing--the time at which defendant must carry her burden of showing a privacy expectation.  See United States v.

In so doing, we examine the evidence, along with reasonable inferences, in the light most favorable to the prosecution.   Id. The evidence may be circumstantial and the prosecution does not have to exclude every reasonable theory of innocence.  United States v.

This count charges defendant and Onyejekwe with using a Chase Manhattan Mastercard in the name of Raymond Walters to purchase two checks in the total amount of $10,150 in violation of &#167; 1029(a)(2).   Defendant first argues that none of the exhibits submitted by the government in relation to this charge showed that she had any involvement in procuring these checks.   However, defendant is being charged as part of a conspiracy.   Under the Pinkerton doctrine, Pinkerton v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span> (1946), a member of a conspiracy may be held liable for the substantive crimes committed by co-conspirators if the substantive crimes were committed in furtherance of the conspiracy and while defendant was a member of the conspiracy.  United States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 324.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think that a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Onyejekwe used the Raymond P. Walters Mastercard in furtherance of the conspiracy and while defendant was a part of the conspiracy.   First, when Onyejekwe and defendant were arrested for using a Mastercard in the name of Beverly Onofrio on July 10, 1991, Onyejekwe was carrying a list of names.   On this list appeared names, birth dates and addresses for both Onofrio and Walters.   Further, the use of the Walters Mastercard occurred in mid-May to June of 1991--only a month prior to the two occasions on which defendant and Onyejekwe used the Onofrio Mastercard at the Lechmere stores.   The jury could reasonably infer, we think, that the use of both the Onofrio and Walters Mastercards occurred as part of one conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, we believe the evidence supports the conclusion that defendant was a participant in the conspiracy when Onyejekwe used the Walters Mastercard.   The common law is that one who joins an ongoing conspiracy, as defendant plainly did on July 6 and 10, \"is deemed to have adopted the prior acts and declarations of coconspirators, made after the formation and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\"  United States v. Cintolo, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488517\"><a href=\"/opinion/488517/united-states-v-william-j-cintolo/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">980</span></a></span>, 997 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></span> (1987).   Given that the names of Walters and Onofrio appeared on the list Onyejekwe was carrying the day defendant was arrested, there was sufficient evidence to convict defendant on Count Two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b). Count Three.   This count concerns the use of Beverly Onofrio's Mastercard at the Lechmere stores on July 6 and 10, in 1991.   Defendant first argues that Exhibit # 12, a photocopy of a Lechmere sales slip, was altered to influence the jury.   She contends that one order number was written over another and that the employee number, 1034, was handwritten, when the usual Lechmere custom is to have the employee number pre-stamped on the sales slip.   Looking at a copy of the sales slip, however, we can discern only one order number--0061903.   As for the writing of the employee's number, there is nothing to support defendant's assertion that Lechmere's \"usual practice\" was to have a printed number.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant next attacks the photo identification procedure by which Alex Shtutin--the Lechmere sales person who sold the telefax machines to defendant and Onyejekwe on July 6--identified defendant.   However, as far as we can tell, defendant never filed a motion to suppress the photo identification prior to trial;  in fact, she did not even object to Shtutin's testimony at trial.   We have held that pretrial photo identification procedures are subject to the requirements of Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(b)(3) and motions to exclude such evidence must be made prior to trial.  United States v. Gomez-Benabe, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600256\"><a href=\"/opinion/600256/united-states-v-miguel-gomez-benabe/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span>, 611-12 (1st Cir.1993).   Given Gomez-Benabe, we think that defendant, by not having given the district court a chance to determine if she should be excused from filing a pretrial motion to suppress, has waived her right to challenge the identification procedure on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(c). Counts Four and Five.  These counts concern, respectively, the use of Onofrio's Discover Card during June 21, 1991 through June 25, 1991, and the use of Onofrio's AT &amp; T Universal Mastercard during June 26, 1991 through July 24, 1991.   Defendant correctly notes, as she did with respect to Count Two, that there was no direct evidence that she ever used either card.   Thus, under Pinkerton, the government was required to prove that the use of the Discover Card and the AT &amp; T Universal Mastercard, during the period from June 21, 1991 to July 24, 1991, was carried out by Onyejekwe in furtherance of the conspiracy and while defendant was involved in the conspiracy.  See Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 324.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to Count Four, the evidence is that the Discover Card was found in Onyejekwe's possession when he was arrested on July 10, and that Onofrio's name was on the list of names Onyejekwe was carrying.   Defendant argues that she was in the hospital during the time the Discover Card was used.   However, absent any claim that she had withdrawn from the conspiracy, the fact that defendant was somewhere else during her co-conspirator's actions is not relevant.  See United States v. Juodakis, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498383\"><a href=\"/opinion/498383/united-states-v-aloyisius-juodakis/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span>, 1102 (1st Cir.1987) (per curiam).   Cessation of activity in a conspiracy is not enough to show withdrawal;  rather, a conspirator must take some affirmative act such as a full confession to authorities or a communication to a co-conspirator that he or she is withdrawing from the enterprise.   Id. Defendant does not allege the existence of such circumstances here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Count Five, defendant points out that the AT &amp; T Universal Mastercard never was recovered.   She also argues that there is no evidence connecting her to the use of the AT &amp; T card.   We do not think that either ground is a sufficient basis on which to overturn the jury's verdict.   First, the question is not only whether defendant used the AT &amp; T card, but also whether Onyejekwe might have used it.   In this regard, we note that the AT &amp; T card was applied for in June 1991 and was used during the same period defendant and Onyejekwe were using the other cards in Onofrio's name.   Because the evidence linking Onyejekwe to the use of Onofrio's name is so strong, we think that the jury rationally could find that Onyejekwe used Onofrio's AT &amp; T Universal Mastercard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(d). Count Six.  This count charged defendant with using a Mastercard in the names of Leonard L. Medeiros and Althea V. Medeiros to withdraw money from automated teller machines.   The government's evidence consisted, in part, of photographs of the person who withdrew money with the card in question.   McCutcheon had testified that she had rented half of the duplex at 10 Stamford Ave. to defendant who told McCutcheon that she (defendant) was Althea Medeiros.   McCutcheon identified defendant as the person in the picture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the photographs should not have been admitted in evidence because they were too blurry for identification purposes.   As a result, she adds, McCutcheon's identification of her was suspect.   However, as with the other photo identification, defendant never filed a motion to suppress the photographs.   Therefore, she has waived an appellate challenge to them.  See Gomez-Benabe, 985 F.2d at 611-12.   In any event, defendant's arguments concerning McCutcheon's testimony really go to credibility.   Thus, we need not review her claims.  See Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 323.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(e). Count One.  Count one charged defendant with conspiracy to commit credit card fraud.   Defendant makes some of the same arguments in support of her contention that the government failed to show a conspiracy between her and Onyejekwe as she made in regard to Counts Two and Four.  For the reasons stated in the discussion regarding Count Two, defendant's arguments, first, that the acts in Counts Two, Four and Five took place prior to July 10 and, second, that she only was present in the Lechmere parking lot on July 10 fail.   Similarly unavailing are the arguments that there was no evidence that defendant ever used a credit card or helped Onyejekwe use a credit card, that defendant's fingerprints were not found on any cards, and that no cards were found on her person.   Under Pinkerton, defendant is responsible for the reasonably foreseeable offenses committed by Onyejekwe in furtherance of the conspiracy since she was a member of the conspiracy during the relevant time periods.  See Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d at 324.   The uses of the various credit cards by Onyejekwe clearly were foreseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Denial of Cross-Examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that on three occasions she was prevented from conducting cross-examination that would have revealed the biases and perjured testimony of the witnesses.   However, a review of the transcript shows that counsel decided to withdraw the questions to which defendant refers and that there is no evidence that either the court or the government \"prevented\" defendant from cross-examining anyone.   Thus, this issue, being fact-based, must be raised as an ineffective assistance claim in a motion under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.  See United States v. Georgacarakos, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602802\"><a href=\"/opinion/602802/united-states-v-peter-n-georgacarakos/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1289</span></a></span>, 1297 (1st Cir.1993) (an ineffective assistance of counsel claim which involves issues not fully developed in the trial record is not ripe for decision on appeal).   For the same reason, we will not consider defendant's other arguments relating to allegedly ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. Improper Jury Instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant complains that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that &#167; 1029 requires the government to prove that she \"actually used\" an unauthorized device to obtain something of value.   Because defendant never objected below, we review for plain error.  See United States v. McGill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"574332\"><a href=\"/opinion/574332/united-states-v-steven-mcgill/\"><span class=\"volume\">952</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">16</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1991).   The jury instructions plainly reveal that the trial judge correctly instructed the jury that, as Pinkerton holds, defendant could be found guilty of fraudulent use of an access device if the jury found that another's use of such a device was part of the conspiracy, that such use was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the conspiracy, and that defendant was a member of the conspiracy when the device was used.   As a result, there was no plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's second argument is that the trial judge improperly used the word \"conspirators\" in reciting the overt acts charged in the indictment.   Essentially, the trial judge substituted the word \"conspirators\" for the words \"the defendants, Christopher Onyejekwe and Elizabeth Mogaji.\"   Thus, as to the first overt act, the judge stated that \"on or about July 6, 1991, conspirators purchased merchandise at Lechmere....\"  Defendant alleges that this communicated to the jury the trial judge's belief that she was guilty.   Again, there is no plain error here.   The trial court judge instructed the jury that the indictment was not proof of anything and clearly defined what elements were necessary for the jury to find that defendant was part of a conspiracy.   The judge also instructed the jury that he had no opinion concerning the facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">5.

Further, a reading of the transcript reveals that this apparently was the second time defense counsel was unprepared to go forward on a matter.   We do not think that this comment provides what \"an objective, knowledgeable member of the public would find to be a reasonable basis for doubting the judge's impartiality.\"   See In re United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398012\"><a href=\"/opinion/398012/in-re-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span>, 695 (1st Cir.1981) (stating the applicable standard under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 455(a)).

Motion for a New Trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her recitation of the facts, defendant mentions that the district court denied her motion for a new trial as untimely.   However, she fails to include in her brief any argument why we should reverse the trial court's ruling.   Thus, she has waived the issue.   A review of the issue nonetheless shows that this claim is meritless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was convicted on May 10, 1994 and the certificate of service of the new trial motion was dated July 6, 1994.   Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 requires such a motion to be filed within seven days after verdict.   At the hearing on the motion, defendant's trial attorney stated that defendant never had asked him to file a motion for a new trial.   Judge Boyle concluded that defendant had been confused over how one obtains a new trial--by a motion or an appeal--and had asked her attorney to file an appeal.   In any event, the untimeliness of the motion for a new trial, a finding supported by the evidence, means that the trial court was without jurisdiction to rule on it.  United States v.
