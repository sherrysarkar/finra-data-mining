The  United States  appeals\r                      LYNCH, Circuit Judge.\r                                          \r\n\nfrom the entry of  summary judgment against it in  its action\r\n\nto  forfeit  one lot  of  currency  totalling $36,634.    The\r\n\ncurrency was seized from Salvatore Mele, Jr. at Logan Airport\r\n\nin  Boston.   The district  court held  that while  there was\r\n\nadequate reason  to believe that  the money was  connected to\r\n\nsome unlawful activity, there  was insufficient evidence that\r\n\nthe unlawful activity involved drugs.  Accordingly, the court\r\n\nheld that the currency  is not forfeitable under 21  U.S.C.  \r\n\n881(a)(6), which requires that the moneys be \"in exchange for\r\n\na  controlled  substance . . .,  proceeds  traceable  to such\r\n\nexchange . . . [or  moneys] used  or intended  to be  used to\r\n\nfacilitate [a] violation of [federal drug laws] . . . .\"  The\r\n\ncourt  reasoned that  the government  had shown  nothing more\r\n\nthan that  Mele met the profile of  a drug courier, which was\r\n\nnot enough.\r\n\n          Attempting to defend his victory, Mele argues  that\r\n\ncertain of  the district  court's predicate rulings  were too\r\n\nfavorable  to  the  government.   Contrary  to  the  district\r\n\ncourt's  holdings, Mele  says, he  was  detained at  Logan in\r\n\nviolation of his  Fourth Amendment rights, and  so the entire\r\n\nforfeiture fails.   Alternatively, he  denies the  government\r\n\nhas met its burden of  establishing probable cause to support\r\n\nthe forfeiture.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\n          We agree with the district court  that there was no\r\n\nFourth  Amendment violation.   On  the forfeiture  issue, the\r\n\nevidence,   which   went   beyond  mere   profile   evidence,\r\n\nestablished a  sufficient  nexus  between  the  currency  and\r\n\nillegal  drug activity,  and it  provided probable  cause for\r\n\nforfeiture.    Accordingly, we  vacate  and  direct entry  of\r\n\njudgment for the government.\r\n\n                              I\r\n\n          Agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement  Agency (\"DEA\")\r\n\nseized the money from Mele on November 1, 1994.  Mele filed a\r\n\nmotion under Fed.  R. Crim.  P. 41(e) seeking  return of  the\r\n\nmoney.  On March 2, 1995, the United States filed a complaint\r\n\nfor forfeiture  in rem,  supported by three  affidavits which\r\n\nspelled out  the government's version of  the agents' airport\r\n\nencounter  with   Mele.    The  district   court  issued  the\r\n\nforfeiture warrant  and monition  on March 23,  and dismissed\r\n\nMele's Rule 41(e) motion shortly thereafter.\r\n\n          Mele then filed his claim of ownership, accompanied\r\n\nby an affidavit which  asserted only that the  money belonged\r\n\nto him, that he had  kept it at his business, and that it had\r\n\nbeen  seized  illegally from  him.    The affidavit  did  not\r\n\naddress any specific  factual allegations  about the  airport\r\n\nencounter.    Mele's  answer  to  the government's  complaint\r\n\ncontained only general denials and admissions.\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\n          The government filed a motion  for summary judgment\r\n\non August 14, supported by the three affidavits filed earlier\r\n\nand  one  additional  affidavit.     Mele  responded  with  a\r\n\nsubmission  captioned as  a \"Motion  in Opposition  to United\r\n\nStates'  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment,\"1   which  contained\r\n\nneither a  statement of  disputed facts nor  any accompanying\r\n\naffidavit.\r\n\n          Six  months later,  on March  4, 1996,  the parties\r\n\nargued  the  summary  judgment  motions.     Mele's  attorney\r\n\nattempted for the  first time  to contradict  several of  the\r\n\ngovernment's asserted facts, and offered to have Mele testify\r\n\non the  spot as to  his version of  the facts.   The district\r\n\njudge declined to permit either of these efforts because Mele\r\n\nhad  not properly put his version of the facts into evidence.\r\n\nHe also denied counsel's oral motion for leave  to supplement\r\n\nthe  record  because Mele  had  had adequate  time  to submit\r\n\nevidence.   The judge, consequently, decided  the case solely\r\n\non  the basis of the facts in the government's affidavits and\r\n\nMele's initial  affidavit.   Despite Mele's failure  to offer\r\n\nany  rebuttal evidence,  however, the  judge ordered  summary\r\n\njudgment in his favor.\r\n\n          Mele  has not  argued on  appeal that  the district\r\n\ncourt erred in denying his motion for leave to supplement the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.  Although  Mele did  not file  a cross-motion  for summary\r\njudgment, the district court treated the case as if he did.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nrecord.   Such  an  argument would  fail in  any event.   The\r\n\ndecision whether to allow a motion for leave falls within the\r\n\ndistrict  court's discretion,  Manzoli  v. Commissioner,  904\r                                                                   \r\n\nF.2d  101, 103  (1st Cir. 1990),  and there  was no  abuse of\r\n\ndiscretion here.\r\n\n          After  losing on  summary judgment,  the government\r\n\nfiled a motion to reconsider, which Mele opposed.  Along with\r\n\nhis  opposition,  Mele  filed  a new  affidavit  in  which he\r\n\ncontested  many  of  the   facts  presented  in  the  earlier\r\n\ngovernment affidavits.  The  district court did not expressly\r\n\nrule  on the admissibility of this new affidavit.  In denying\r\n\nthe government's  motion, on the grounds  that the government\r\n\nhad  failed to show probable cause to forfeit, the court made\r\n\nno reference to Mele's  proffer.  Given this and  the court's\r\n\nearlier  rulings, we  believe  the court  did  not allow  the\r\n\naffidavit.\r\n\n          Mele  has not  argued on  appeal that  the district\r\n\ncourt erred in refusing  to consider his late-filed affidavit\r\n\nor that it was  required to consider it.2   Such an  argument\r\n\ntoo would fail.  District court rulings pertaining to motions\r\n\nfor  reconsideration are  reviewed for  abuse of  discretion,\r\n\nGross v.  Summa Four, Inc.,  93 F.3d  987, 996 n.9  (1st Cir.\r                                      \r\n\n1996),  and there was no abuse here.  Accordingly, on appeal,\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n2.  Nor does  he  argue  that  the  court  did  consider  the\r                                                          \r\naffidavit.\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nwe take the facts as presented to the court before the motion\r\n\nfor reconsideration and the opposition were filed.\r\n\n                              II\r\n\n          On  November 1, 1994, DEA Transportation Task Force\r\n\nAgents Peter  McCarron and  Michael Cauley were  stationed in\r\n\nBoston's  Logan  Airport.   They  were  observing  passengers\r\n\nchecking  in for a 10:20 p.m. \"red-eye\" flight to Los Angeles\r\n\nat the America West Airlines ticket counter.  They observed a\r\n\nman, Salvatore Mele,  Jr., pay  for his ticket  with $972  in\r\n\ncash, mostly twenty dollar bills.  The man seemed nervous and\r\n\n\"continuously  scanned\" the  area.   He  was carrying  only a\r\n\nnylon bag, which appeared to be mostly empty, and  he did not\r\n\ncheck any luggage.\r\n\n          After   Mele  purchased  his   ticket,  the  agents\r\n\napproached him and asked if they could speak with him.   Mele\r\n\nagreed,  trembling  and with  a look  of  panic on  his face.\r\n\nAgent McCarron asked to  see Mele's ticket.  It was  a round-\r\n\ntrip  ticket from Boston to Los Angeles, with a brief middle-\r\n\nof-the-night layover in Las Vegas on the outbound part of the\r\n\ntrip.  The return trip was for four days later, on a Saturday\r\n\nnight red-eye flight, America West flight 68.\r\n\n          Seeing the name \"Sal  Mele\" on the ticket, McCarron\r\n\nrecognized Mele  as an associate  of Anthony Bucci  and Ralph\r\n\nPenta, two  men known  to McCarron as  marijuana traffickers.\r\n\nBucci and Penta  had been  arrested six weeks  earlier, on  a\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nSunday morning in September,  at Logan Airport for possession\r\n\nof  thirty pounds  of  marijuana with  intent to  distribute.\r\n\nPenta had flown  in from  Los Angeles on  the same  overnight\r\n\nAmerica  West flight  68 that  Mele intended  to take.   Upon\r\n\nPenta's  arrival  at  Logan  Airport, he  had  delivered  the\r\n\nmarijuana to Bucci, who was waiting for him.  At his booking,\r\n\nBucci  had said that he  lived at 500  Salem Street, Medford,\r\n\nMassachusetts  and that he  was a  business partner  of Mele.\r\n\nPenta  had told  his parole  officer that  he was  working in\r\n\nMele's  pizza shop.  McCarron also recognized Mele as the man\r\n\nwho had come that Sunday morning  to bail Penta out after the\r\n\narrest, paying $10,000 in cash.\r\n\n          With   this   history  in   mind,   McCarron  began\r\n\nquestioning  Mele about his trip.  Mele told McCarron that he\r\n\nwas going to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife and children.  He\r\n\nappeared  nervous and was sweating.  McCarron asked him if he\r\n\nwas  carrying any  narcotics or  large sums  of money.   Mele\r\n\nresponded  that he  was not,  but stuttered in  his response.\r\n\nMcCarron repeated the question, and this  time Mele said that\r\n\nhe had \"some money.\"  When McCarron asked  him how much, Mele\r\n\nanswered  \"about $30,000.\"   McCarron  asked him  why he  was\r\n\ncarrying so much money,  and Mele replied that he  planned to\r\n\ndo some  gambling in Las  Vegas and look  around for  a pizza\r\n\nshop  to buy there.  McCarron had already seen Mele's ticket,\r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\nwhich provided only a brief layover in Las Vegas  en route to\r\n\nLos Angeles.\r\n\n          McCarron  then asked  Mele if  he would  mind going\r\n\nwith  them to the DEA's  airport field office  to discuss the\r\n\nmoney  further.   Mele  agreed, and  they  went to  the field\r\n\noffice.  Agent Thomas G. Quin joined Mele and McCarron in the\r\n\noffice  shortly after their arrival.  One of the agents asked\r\n\nMele to  show them the money.  As Mele removed the money from\r\n\na  fanny pack he wore around his waist, McCarron noticed four\r\n\nvalium tablets in the plastic wrapper of a cigarette package.\r\n\nMele  stated that he had been prescribed valium for his back.\r\n\nWhen asked why the valium was not in the prescription bottle,\r\n\nMele said that he had brought just a few pills  for his trip.\r\n\nQuin told  Mele that  he was  going to  seize the  valium and\r\n\nsummons  Mele to  court if  Mele did  not bring  evidence the\r\n\nfollowing  day   to  prove  that  the   valium  was  properly\r\n\nprescribed.\r\n\n          The  agents then  counted the money  and questioned\r\n\nMele more about his plans.  Mele reiterated his claim that he\r\n\nwas going to Las Vegas to visit his  ex-wife and children and\r\n\nto look for  a pizza place.  He would  not provide the agents\r\n\nwith  his ex-wife's  address  or with  any information  about\r\n\nhotel  reservations in Las Vegas.   When asked  the source of\r\n\nthe money, Mele first said  he had gotten the money  from his\r\n\n                             -8-\r                                          8\r\r\n\npizza shop,  where he kept  it hidden, and  then said  it was\r\n\nfrom his savings and a court settlement.\r\n\n          The agents asked Mele where  he had been before his\r\n\narrival at  the airport.  Mele stated  that a friend, whom he\r\n\nrefused  to name, had driven  him to a  restaurant in Saugus,\r\n\nwhere  he had dinner with  his girlfriend.   After dinner, he\r\n\nhad his girlfriend drive  him from the restaurant to  an Osco\r\n\ndrugstore  on Salem Street in Medford and drop him off there.\r\n\nWhen asked  why  he had  her  drop  him off  at  the  Medford\r\n\ndrugstore,  Mele replied that he  had to get  \"a few things,\"\r\n\nspecifically,  a few packs of gum.  Mele was, however, unable\r\n\nto  produce  the gum.   Mele  stated  that after  leaving the\r\n\ndrugstore, he flagged down a taxi and went to the airport.\r\n\n          Quin  knew  that  the   drugstore  in  Medford  was\r\n\ndirectly across the street from 500 Salem Avenue, the address\r\n\nAnthony  Bucci had given when arrested six weeks earlier.  At\r\n\nthis point, Quin told Mele that his story was not believable.\r\n\nQuin  stated that he thought the money was from drug proceeds\r\n\nand  that  Mele was  going to  Los  Angeles to  purchase more\r\n\ndrugs.  He informed  Mele that the money was  therefore being\r\n\nseized and he gave Mele a receipt.\r\n\n          The next day  Mele arrived at  the DEA office  with\r\n\nhis  attorney.     He   was  unable  to   provide  sufficient\r\n\ndocumentation to show that  the valium was validly prescribed\r\n\nto him,  as Quin  had demanded.   One  of the  agents noticed\r\n\n                             -9-\r                                          9\r\r\n\nBucci  waiting outside in the car while Mele and his attorney\r\n\nwere  in the  office.  Later  that day, the  seized money was\r\n\nplaced in a bag  and, along with several other  similar bags,\r\n\nwas  presented  to a  narcotics-detection  dog.   To  use the\r\n\njargon  of the genre, the dog \"alerted\" to the bag containing\r\n\nthe money.\r\n\n                             III\r\n\n          Mele  mounts  two  separate  attacks.    First,  he\r\n\ncontends that the government's  entire case must fail because\r\n\nthe  initial seizure  of the  money, as well  as much  of the\r\n\nquestioning,  was  tainted  by  a  violation  of  his  Fourth\r\n\nAmendment rights.3   Alternatively, he disputes the existence\r\n\nof  probable  cause  at   the  forfeiture  stage,  which  the\r\n\ngovernment must show in order to forfeit the money.4\r\n\n          Review here  is  de  novo  for two  reasons.    The\r\n\ndistrict  court's grant  of summary  judgment is  reviewed de\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.

Fourth Amendment\r\n\n          Mele argues  that his Fourth Amendment  rights were\r\n\nviolated  because the agents  brought him to  the DEA airport\r\n\nfield  office  from  the  ticket  counter,  transforming  the\r\n\ninitially consensual encounter  into a stop.   This stop,  he\r\n\nsays,   lacked  the  reasonable   and  articulable  suspicion\r\n\nnecessary  to justify it.   See generally Terry  v. Ohio, 392\r                                                                    \r\n\nU.S.  1 (1968); United States  v.

Further, he contends, the stop  became a\r\n\nde  facto arrest because of  its duration and  because of the\r\n\nnature of the place to which he was taken by the agents.  The\r\n\nprobable cause necessary to  uphold an arrest, he argues,  is\r\n\nsimilarly lacking.\r\n\n          The government  affidavits say that Mele  went with\r\n\nthe  agents to the DEA  field office voluntarily  and that he\r\n\nwas not told the money would  be seized until some time after\r\n\nthey  had arrived  at the  office.   Mele, on  such evidence,\r\n\nplainly  consented to going to the DEA office, and his Fourth\r\n\n                             -11-\r                                          11\r\r\n\nAmendment arguments  are baseless.5   There are  no colorable\r\n\nFourth  Amendment concerns where an officer simply asks a few\r\n\nquestions to a civilian, who voluntarily allows the encounter\r\n\nto  continue.

Nor is  an otherwise\r\n\nconsensual encounter stripped of its consensual nature by the\r\n\nmere act  of moving to  a police office.   See, e.g.,  United\r                                                                         \r\n\nStates v.

Mele's\r\n\nmoney was lawfully seized, and thus the forfeiture proceeding\r\n\nthat followed  was not tainted  by unconstitutional  conduct.\r\n\nThe  dispositive  issue  with  respect  to  the  government's\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.

Probable Cause for Forfeiture\r\n\n          The district court  correctly found that  there was\r\n\nprobable cause to believe that Mele was involved in some kind\r\n\nof illegal activity, but erred in finding that the government\r\n\nhad  failed  to  establish  a sufficient  nexus  between  his\r\n\nsuspicious  activity and  the illegal  drug trade,  which the\r\n\nforfeiture statute, 21 U.S.C.   881, requires.\r\n\n          In civil forfeiture cases brought by the government\r\n\nunder    881, U.S. Customs procedures  control the allocation\r\n\nof  the  parties'  burdens  of  proof.  21  U.S.C.     881(d)\r\n\n(incorporating by reference U.S.  Customs procedures).  Those\r\n\nprocedures employ a burden shifting mechanism.  See 19 U.S.C.\r                                                               \r\n\n  1615; United States v. $5,644,540, 799 F.2d 1357, 1362 (9th\r                                               \r\n\nCir. 1986).  Under this mechanism, the government must at the\r\n\noutset demonstrate  that it  has probable cause  to institute\r\n\nthe forfeiture  proceeding.  United States v. 255 Broadway, 9\r                                                                      \r\n\nF.3d 1000, 1003-04 (1st  Cir. 1993).  More  specifically, the\r\n\ngovernment  must show that  it has probable  cause to believe\r\n\n\"that the  property had  the requisite  nexus to  a specified\r\n\nillegal purpose.\"  United States v. $68,000, 927  F.2d 30, 32\r                                                       \r\n\n(1st  Cir. 1991).6    When the  government  seeks to  forfeit\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.

Contrary to  the government's argument, however, there is\r\nlittle  significance  in  the   fact  that  Mele's  cash  was\r\n\"concealed,\" i.e., that  it he  carried it in  a fanny  pack.\r\nFew people  carry money,  especially large sums,  in any  way\r\nother than \"concealed.\"\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\n3.6(e), at 327-33 (false, evasive, or misleading responses to\r\n\nofficers' questions  can contribute  to probable cause).

As  the\r\n\nSecond Circuit  has rightly  observed, an  \"evasive, confused\r\n\nexplanation  for carrying such  a large  sum\" serves  only to\r\n\n\"further arouse[] . . . suspicion[].\"   $37,780, 920  F.2d at\r                                                           \r\n\n163.9\r\n\n          Mele's obvious nervousness, evident both before the\r\n\nagents approached him and  during the interview, although not\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n9.

The designation  by the government of  Los Angeles\r\nas  a \"known  source city\"  for narcotics  is also  of little\r\nimportance.  See United States v.

The currency was seized from Salvatore Mele, Jr. at Logan Airport in Boston.  The district court held that while there was adequate reason to believe that the money was connected to some unlawful activity, there was insufficient evidence that the unlawful activity involved drugs.  Accordingly, the court held that the currency is not forfeitable under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(a)(6), which requires that the moneys be \"in exchange for a controlled substance ..., proceeds traceable to such exchange ... [or moneys] used or intended to be used to facilitate [a] violation of [federal drug laws]....\"  The court reasoned that the government had shown nothing more than that Mele met the profile of a drug courier, which was not enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to defend his victory, Mele argues that certain of the district court's predicate rulings were too favorable to the government.  Contrary to the district court's holdings, Mele says, he was detained at Logan in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, and so the entire forfeiture fails.  Alternatively, he denies the government has met its burden of establishing probable cause to support the forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that there was no Fourth Amendment violation.  On the forfeiture issue, the evidence, which went beyond mere profile evidence, established a sufficient nexus between the currency and illegal drug activity, and it provided probable cause for forfeiture.  Accordingly, we vacate and direct entry of judgment for the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") seized the money from Mele on November 1, 1994.  Mele filed a motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e) seeking return of the money.  On March 2, 1995, the United States filed a complaint for forfeiture in rem, supported by three affidavits which spelled out the government's version of the agents' airport encounter with Mele.  The district court issued the forfeiture warrant and monition on March 23, and dismissed Mele's Rule 41(e) motion shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele then filed his claim of ownership, accompanied by an affidavit which asserted only that the money belonged to him, that he had kept it at his business, and that it had been seized illegally from him.  The affidavit did not address any specific factual allegations about the airport encounter.  Mele's answer to the government's complaint contained only general denials and admissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a motion for summary judgment on August 14, supported by the three affidavits filed earlier and one additional affidavit.  Mele responded with a submission captioned as a \"Motion in Opposition to United States' Motion for Summary Judgment,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> which contained neither a statement of disputed facts nor any accompanying affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months later, on March 4, 1996, the parties argued the summary judgment motions.  Mele's attorney attempted for the first time to contradict several of the government's asserted facts, and offered to have Mele testify on the spot as to his version of the facts.  The district judge declined to permit either of these efforts because Mele had not properly put his version of the facts into evidence.  He also denied counsel's oral motion for leave to supplement the record because Mele had had adequate time to submit evidence.  The judge, consequently, decided the case solely on the basis of the facts in the government's affidavits and Mele's initial affidavit.  Despite Mele's failure to offer any rebuttal evidence, however, the judge ordered summary judgment in his favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele has not argued on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion for leave to supplement the record.  Such an argument would fail in any event.  The decision whether to allow a motion for leave falls within the district court's discretion, Manzoli v. Commissioner, 904 F.2d 101, 103 (1st Cir.1990), and there was no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After losing on summary judgment, the government filed a motion to reconsider, which Mele opposed.  Along with his opposition, Mele filed a new affidavit in which he contested many of the facts presented in the earlier government affidavits.  The district court did not expressly rule on the admissibility of this new affidavit.  In denying the government's motion, on the grounds that the government had failed to show probable cause to forfeit, the court made no reference to Mele's proffer.  Given this and the court's earlier rulings, we believe the court did not allow the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele has not argued on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to consider his late-filed affidavit or that it was required to consider it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Such an argument too would fail.  District court rulings pertaining to motions for reconsideration are reviewed for abuse of discretion, Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., 93 F.3d 987, 996 n. 9 (1st Cir.1996) , and there was no abuse here.  Accordingly, on appeal, we take the facts as presented to the court before the motion for reconsideration and the opposition were filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 1994, DEA Transportation Task Force Agents Peter McCarron and Michael Cauley were stationed in Boston's Logan Airport.  They were observing passengers checking in for a 10:20 p.m.  \"red-eye\" flight to Los Angeles at the America West Airlines ticket counter.  They observed a man, Salvatore Mele, Jr., pay for his ticket with $972 in cash, mostly twenty dollar bills.  The man seemed nervous and \"continuously scanned\" the area.  He was carrying only a nylon bag, which appeared to be mostly empty, and he did not check any luggage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Mele purchased his ticket, the agents approached him and asked if they could speak with him.  Mele agreed, trembling and with a look of panic on his face.  Agent McCarron asked to see Mele's ticket.  It was a round-trip ticket from Boston to Los Angeles, with a brief middle-of-the-night layover in Las Vegas on the outbound part of the trip.  The return trip was for four days later, on a Saturday night red-eye flight, America West flight 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeing the name \"Sal Mele\" on the ticket, McCarron recognized Mele as an associate of Anthony Bucci and Ralph Penta, two men known to McCarron as marijuana traffickers.  Bucci and Penta had been arrested six weeks earlier, on a Sunday morning in September, at Logan Airport for possession of thirty pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute.  Penta had flown in from Los Angeles on the same overnight America West flight 68 that Mele intended to take.  Upon Penta's arrival at Logan Airport, he had delivered the marijuana to Bucci, who was waiting for him.  At his booking, Bucci had said that he lived at 500 Salem Street, Medford, Massachusetts and that he was a business partner of Mele.  Penta had told his parole officer that he was working in Mele's pizza shop.  McCarron also recognized Mele as the man who had come that Sunday morning to bail Penta out after the arrest, paying $10,000 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this history in mind, McCarron began questioning Mele about his trip.  Mele told McCarron that he was going to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife and children.  He appeared nervous and was sweating.  McCarron asked him if he was carrying any narcotics or large sums of money.  Mele responded that he was not, but stuttered in his response.  McCarron repeated the question, and this time Mele said that he had \"some money.\"   When McCarron asked him how much, Mele answered \"about $30,000.\"   McCarron asked him why he was carrying so much money, and Mele replied that he planned to do some gambling in Las Vegas and look around for a pizza shop to buy there.  McCarron had already seen Mele's ticket, which provided only a brief layover in Las Vegas en route to Los Angeles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarron then asked Mele if he would mind going with them to the DEA's airport field office to discuss the money further.  Mele agreed, and they went to the field office.  Agent Thomas G. Quin joined Mele and McCarron in the office shortly after their arrival.  One of the agents asked Mele to show them the money.  As Mele removed the money from a fanny pack he wore around his waist, McCarron noticed four valium tablets in the plastic wrapper of a cigarette package.  Mele stated that he had been prescribed valium for his back.  When asked why the valium was not in the prescription bottle, Mele said that he had brought just a few pills for his trip.  Quin told Mele that he was going to seize the valium and summons Mele to court if Mele did not bring evidence the following day to prove that the valium was properly prescribed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents then counted the money and questioned Mele more about his plans.  Mele reiterated his claim that he was going to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife and children and to look for a pizza place.  He would not provide the agents with his ex-wife's address or with any information about hotel reservations in Las Vegas.  When asked the source of the money, Mele first said he had gotten the money from his pizza shop, where he kept it hidden, and then said it was from his savings and a court settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents asked Mele where he had been before his arrival at the airport.  Mele stated that a friend, whom he refused to name, had driven him to a restaurant in Saugus, where he had dinner with his girlfriend.  After dinner, he had his girlfriend drive him from the restaurant to an Osco drugstore on Salem Street in Medford and drop him off there.  When asked why he had her drop him off at the Medford drugstore, Mele replied that he had to get \"a few things,\" specifically, a few packs of gum.  Mele was, however, unable to produce the gum.  Mele stated that after leaving the drugstore, he flagged down a taxi and went to the airport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quin knew that the drugstore in Medford was directly across the street from 500 Salem Avenue, the address Anthony Bucci had given when arrested six weeks earlier.  At this point, Quin told Mele that his story was not believable.  Quin stated that he thought the money was from drug proceeds and that Mele was going to Los Angeles to purchase more drugs.  He informed Mele that the money was therefore being seized and he gave Mele a receipt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day Mele arrived at the DEA office with his attorney.  He was unable to provide sufficient documentation to show that the valium was validly prescribed to him, as Quin had demanded.  One of the agents noticed Bucci waiting outside in the car while Mele and his attorney were in the office.  Later that day, the seized money was placed in a bag and, along with several other similar bags, was presented to a narcotics-detection dog.  To use the jargon of the genre, the dog \"alerted\" to the bag containing the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele mounts two separate attacks.  First, he contends that the government's entire case must fail because the initial seizure of the money, as well as much of the questioning, was tainted by a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Alternatively, he disputes the existence of probable cause at the forfeiture stage, which the government must show in order to forfeit the money.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review here is de novo for two reasons.  The district court's grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.  Wood v. Clemons, 89 F.3d 922 (1st Cir.1996).  Additionally, the Supreme Court held last term that review by the courts of appeals of conclusions as to whether there had been a violation of the Fourth Amendment is de novo.  Ornelas v. United States, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Fourth Amendment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele argues that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated because the agents brought him to the DEA airport field office from the ticket counter, transforming the initially consensual encounter into a stop.  This stop, he says, lacked the reasonable and articulable suspicion necessary to justify it.  See generally Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968);  United States v. McCarthy, 77 F.3d 522 (1st Cir.1996), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 479, 136 L.Ed.2d 374 (1996).   Further, he contends, the stop became a de facto arrest because of its duration and because of the nature of the place to which he was taken by the agents.  The probable cause necessary to uphold an arrest, he argues, is similarly lacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government affidavits say that Mele went with the agents to the DEA field office voluntarily and that he was not told the money would be seized until some time after they had arrived at the office.  Mele, on such evidence, plainly consented to going to the DEA office, and his Fourth Amendment arguments are baseless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  There are no colorable Fourth Amendment concerns where an officer simply asks a few questions to a civilian, who voluntarily allows the encounter to continue.  See, e.g., Florida v. Bostick, 501 U.S. 429, 434, 111 S.Ct. 2382, 2386, 115 L.Ed.2d 389 (1991) (\"The encounter will not trigger Fourth Amendment scrutiny unless it loses its consensual nature.\");  Florida v. Rodriguez, 469 U.S. 1, 5-6, 105 S.Ct. 308, 310-11, 83 L.Ed.2d 165 (1984);  Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 497, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1323-24, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (plurality opinion).  Nor is an otherwise consensual encounter stripped of its consensual nature by the mere act of moving to a police office.  See, e.g., United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 557-58, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1878-79, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (plurality opinion);  United States v. Jodoin, 672 F.2d 232, 234 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents did not violate Mele's Fourth Amendment rights during their Logan Airport encounter with him.  Mele's money was lawfully seized, and thus the forfeiture proceeding that followed was not tainted by unconstitutional conduct.  The dispositive issue with respect to the government's forfeiture case, then, is whether there was probable cause for forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Probable Cause for Forfeiture</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly found that there was probable cause to believe that Mele was involved in some kind of illegal activity, but erred in finding that the government had failed to establish a sufficient nexus between his suspicious activity and the illegal drug trade, which the forfeiture statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881, requires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In civil forfeiture cases brought by the government under &#167; 881, U.S. Customs procedures control the allocation of the parties' burdens of proof.  21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(d) (incorporating by reference U.S. Customs procedures).  Those procedures employ a burden shifting mechanism.  See 19 U.S.C. &#167; 1615;  United States v. $5,644,540, 799 F.2d 1357, 1362 (9th Cir.1986).  Under this mechanism, the government must at the outset demonstrate that it has probable cause to institute the forfeiture proceeding.  United States v. 255 Broadway, 9 F.3d 1000, 1003-04 (1st Cir.1993).  More specifically, the government must show that it has probable cause to believe \"that the property had the requisite nexus to a specified illegal purpose.\"  United States v. One Lot of U.S. Currency ($68,000), 927 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir.1991).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  When the government seeks to forfeit money, the nexus can be shown by demonstrating probable cause to believe either that the money represented the proceeds of a drug sale, see 255 Broadway, 9 F.3d at 1004, or that it was intended to be used in the purchase of drugs, see $68,000, 927 F.2d at 32.   The government need not trace the money to any particular drug transaction.  255 Broadway, 9 F.3d at 1004;  United States v. Parcels of Land, 903 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir.1990);  United States v. $250,000, 808 F.2d 895, 899-900 (1st Cir.1987).  Once the government has made the nexus showing, the burden then shifts to the claimant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the property is not subject to forfeiture.  255 Broadway, 9 F.3d at 1004;  $68,000, 927 F.2d at 32;  $250,000, 808 F.2d at 897;  cf.  Degen v. United States, --- U.S. ----, ----, 116 S.Ct. 1777, 1781, 135 L.Ed.2d 102 (1996) (\"The Government has shown probable cause to forfeit the property, and [claimant] must refute the showing or suffer its loss.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Burden shifting aside, probable cause for forfeiture may be measured by what the government knew at the time of the institution of the forfeiture proceedings, not just what it knew at the time of the seizure.  255 Broadway, 9 F.3d at 1004;  United States v. $191,910, 16 F.3d 1051, 1066 (9th Cir.1994);  United States v. $12,390, 956 F.2d 801, 806 n. 5 (8th Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause for the purpose of &#167; 881 forfeiture means a \"reasonable ground\" for believing that the money is connected with illegal drug transactions.  255 Broadway, 9 F.3d at 1004;  28 Emery St., 914 F.2d at 3;  $250,000, 808 F.2d at 897.

Courts \" 'review each piece of evidence only to determine whether it is probative, not whether it establishes probable cause standing alone.' \"  255 Broadway, 9 F.3d at 1004 (quoting United States v. $67,220, 957 F.2d 280, 285 (6th Cir.1992)).  Even where \"no particular circumstance is conclusive,\" it is \"the 'aggregate' of the facts\" that is examined. $250,000, 808 F.2d at 899 (quoting United States v. $93,685.61, 730 F.2d 571, 572 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, Willis v. United States, 469 U.S. 831, 105 S.Ct. 119, 83 L.Ed.2d 61 (1984)).  Mele attacks each brick alone, but fails effectively to attack the wall of probable cause.  Taken as a whole, the facts here are more than adequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with Mele's ties to Bucci and Penta.  Association with known criminals, without more, is, of course, not enough to establish probable cause.  See United States v. Coggins, 986 F.2d 651, 655 (3d Cir.1993) (\"Mere association with a known criminal cannot on its own be a basis for a 'reasonable suspicion.' \"  (citing Ybarra v.

But here there are additional facts that deepen the probative value of Mele's association with the accused drug traffickers Bucci and Penta:  Mele's strange route to the airport;  Mele's and Penta's nearly identical itineraries;  Bucci's appearance with Mele at the DEA office;  and Mele's bailing out of Penta with a large sum of cash when banks were closed.  This is more than \"an incidental or fortuitous connection,\" United States v. 1933 Commonwealth Avenue, 913 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1990), to known drug trafficking activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele was also carrying an extremely large sum of cash.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  See United States v. $37,780, 920 F.2d 159, 163 (2d Cir.1990) (\"Hernandez was carrying an extremely large sum of cash [$37,780] in small denominations, demonstrating that he was either inordinately carefree with his money or was involved in illegal activity.\");  United States v. $175,260, 741 F.Supp. 45, 47 (E.D.N.Y.1990) (carrying $175,000 in airport contributes to probable cause for forfeiture because that is far more than the average person carries).  Given the other facts here, it is not fatal to the government's case that Mele was not carrying drugs or drug paraphernalia at the time the money was seized from him.  See United States v. $215,300, 882 F.2d 417, 419 (9th Cir.1989) (\"Carrying a large sum of cash is 'strong evidence' of [a connection to illegal drug activity] even without the presence of drugs or drug paraphernalia.\"  (quoting United States v. $83,310.78, 851 F.2d 1231, 1236 (9th Cir.1988))), cert. denied, 497 U.S. 1005, 110 S.Ct. 3242, 111 L.Ed.2d 752 (1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, Mele's behavior at the airport only deepens the probable cause.  See generally 2 LaFave, supra, &#167; 3.6(e), at 327-33 (false, evasive, or misleading responses to officers' questions can contribute to probable cause).  In particular, his claims that he intended to gamble in Las Vegas and look for a pizza shop to buy there made no sense in light of the fact that his ticket provided only a brief, middle-of-the-night layover in that Nevada city.  As the Second Circuit has rightly observed, an \"evasive, confused explanation for carrying such a large sum\" serves only to \"further arouse[ ] ... suspicion[ ].\" $37,780, 920 F.2d at 163.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele's obvious nervousness, evident both before the agents approached him and during the interview, although not alone of much probative value, see Jones v. DEA, 819 F.Supp. 698, 702 (M.D.Tenn.1993) (noting that air travelers are \"often nervous about their trip and the dangers, real or imagined, which air travel poses to them\"), does have some probative value when seen in combination with the rest of the story.

The currency was seized from Salvatore Mele, Jr. at Logan Airport in Boston.  The district court held that while there was adequate reason to believe that the money was connected to some unlawful activity, there was insufficient evidence that the unlawful activity involved drugs.  Accordingly, the court held that the currency is not forfeitable under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 881(a)(6), which requires that the moneys be \"in exchange for a controlled substance ..., proceeds traceable to such exchange ... [or moneys] used or intended to be used to facilitate [a] violation of [federal drug laws]....\"  The court reasoned that the government had shown nothing more than that Mele met the profile of a drug courier, which was not enough.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Attempting to defend his victory, Mele argues that certain of the district court's predicate rulings were too favorable to the government.  Contrary to the district court's holdings, Mele says, he was detained at Logan in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights, and so the entire forfeiture fails.  Alternatively, he denies the government has met its burden of establishing probable cause to support the forfeiture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that there was no Fourth Amendment violation.  On the forfeiture issue, the evidence, which went beyond mere profile evidence, established a sufficient nexus between the currency and illegal drug activity, and it provided probable cause for forfeiture.  Accordingly, we vacate and direct entry of judgment for the government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* Agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") seized the money from Mele on November 1, 1994.  Mele filed a motion under Fed.R.Crim.P. 41(e) seeking return of the money.  On March 2, 1995, the United States filed a complaint for forfeiture in rem, supported by three affidavits which spelled out the government's version of the agents' airport encounter with Mele.  The district court issued the forfeiture warrant and monition on March 23, and dismissed Mele's Rule 41(e) motion shortly thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele then filed his claim of ownership, accompanied by an affidavit which asserted only that the money belonged to him, that he had kept it at his business, and that it had been seized illegally from him.  The affidavit did not address any specific factual allegations about the airport encounter.  Mele's answer to the government's complaint contained only general denials and admissions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government filed a motion for summary judgment on August 14, supported by the three affidavits filed earlier and one additional affidavit.  Mele responded with a submission captioned as a \"Motion in Opposition to United States' Motion for Summary Judgment,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> which contained neither a statement of disputed facts nor any accompanying affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Six months later, on March 4, 1996, the parties argued the summary judgment motions.  Mele's attorney attempted for the first time to contradict several of the government's asserted facts, and offered to have Mele testify on the spot as to his version of the facts.  The district judge declined to permit either of these efforts because Mele had not properly put his version of the facts into evidence.  He also denied counsel's oral motion for leave to supplement the record because Mele had had adequate time to submit evidence.  The judge, consequently, decided the case solely on the basis of the facts in the government's affidavits and Mele's initial affidavit.  Despite Mele's failure to offer any rebuttal evidence, however, the judge ordered summary judgment in his favor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele has not argued on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motion for leave to supplement the record.  Such an argument would fail in any event.  The decision whether to allow a motion for leave falls within the district court's discretion, Manzoli v. Commissioner, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542295\"><a href=\"/opinion/542295/leo-manzoli-and-mary-ann-manzoli-v-commissioner-of-internal-revenue/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span>, 103 (1st Cir.1990), and there was no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After losing on summary judgment, the government filed a motion to reconsider, which Mele opposed.  Along with his opposition, Mele filed a new affidavit in which he contested many of the facts presented in the earlier government affidavits.  The district court did not expressly rule on the admissibility of this new affidavit.  In denying the government's motion, on the grounds that the government had failed to show probable cause to forfeit, the court made no reference to Mele's proffer.  Given this and the court's earlier rulings, we believe the court did not allow the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele has not argued on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to consider his late-filed affidavit or that it was required to consider it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Such an argument too would fail.  District court rulings pertaining to motions for reconsideration are reviewed for abuse of discretion, Gross v.

Accordingly, on appeal, we take the facts as presented to the court before the motion for reconsideration and the opposition were filed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 1, 1994, DEA Transportation Task Force Agents Peter McCarron and Michael Cauley were stationed in Boston's Logan Airport.  They were observing passengers checking in for a 10:20 p.m.  \"red-eye\" flight to Los Angeles at the America West Airlines ticket counter.  They observed a man, Salvatore Mele, Jr., pay for his ticket with $972 in cash, mostly twenty dollar bills.  The man seemed nervous and \"continuously scanned\" the area.  He was carrying only a nylon bag, which appeared to be mostly empty, and he did not check any luggage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Mele purchased his ticket, the agents approached him and asked if they could speak with him.  Mele agreed, trembling and with a look of panic on his face.  Agent McCarron asked to see Mele's ticket.  It was a round-trip ticket from Boston to Los Angeles, with a brief middle-of-the-night layover in Las Vegas on the outbound part of the trip.  The return trip was for four days later, on a Saturday night red-eye flight, America West flight 68.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeing the name \"Sal Mele\" on the ticket, McCarron recognized Mele as an associate of Anthony Bucci and Ralph Penta, two men known to McCarron as marijuana traffickers.  Bucci and Penta had been arrested six weeks earlier, on a Sunday morning in September, at Logan Airport for possession of thirty pounds of marijuana with intent to distribute.  Penta had flown in from Los Angeles on the same overnight America West flight 68 that Mele intended to take.  Upon Penta's arrival at Logan Airport, he had delivered the marijuana to Bucci, who was waiting for him.  At his booking, Bucci had said that he lived at 500 Salem Street, Medford, Massachusetts and that he was a business partner of Mele.  Penta had told his parole officer that he was working in Mele's pizza shop.  McCarron also recognized Mele as the man who had come that Sunday morning to bail Penta out after the arrest, paying $10,000 in cash.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this history in mind, McCarron began questioning Mele about his trip.  Mele told McCarron that he was going to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife and children.  He appeared nervous and was sweating.  McCarron asked him if he was carrying any narcotics or large sums of money.  Mele responded that he was not, but stuttered in his response.  McCarron repeated the question, and this time Mele said that he had \"some money.\"   When McCarron asked him how much, Mele answered \"about $30,000.\"   McCarron asked him why he was carrying so much money, and Mele replied that he planned to do some gambling in Las Vegas and look around for a pizza shop to buy there.  McCarron had already seen Mele's ticket, which provided only a brief layover in Las Vegas en route to Los Angeles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McCarron then asked Mele if he would mind going with them to the DEA's airport field office to discuss the money further.  Mele agreed, and they went to the field office.  Agent Thomas G. Quin joined Mele and McCarron in the office shortly after their arrival.  One of the agents asked Mele to show them the money.  As Mele removed the money from a fanny pack he wore around his waist, McCarron noticed four valium tablets in the plastic wrapper of a cigarette package.  Mele stated that he had been prescribed valium for his back.  When asked why the valium was not in the prescription bottle, Mele said that he had brought just a few pills for his trip.  Quin told Mele that he was going to seize the valium and summons Mele to court if Mele did not bring evidence the following day to prove that the valium was properly prescribed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents then counted the money and questioned Mele more about his plans.  Mele reiterated his claim that he was going to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife and children and to look for a pizza place.  He would not provide the agents with his ex-wife's address or with any information about hotel reservations in Las Vegas.  When asked the source of the money, Mele first said he had gotten the money from his pizza shop, where he kept it hidden, and then said it was from his savings and a court settlement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agents asked Mele where he had been before his arrival at the airport.  Mele stated that a friend, whom he refused to name, had driven him to a restaurant in Saugus, where he had dinner with his girlfriend.  After dinner, he had his girlfriend drive him from the restaurant to an Osco drugstore on Salem Street in Medford and drop him off there.  When asked why he had her drop him off at the Medford drugstore, Mele replied that he had to get \"a few things,\" specifically, a few packs of gum.  Mele was, however, unable to produce the gum.  Mele stated that after leaving the drugstore, he flagged down a taxi and went to the airport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Quin knew that the drugstore in Medford was directly across the street from 500 Salem Avenue, the address Anthony Bucci had given when arrested six weeks earlier.  At this point, Quin told Mele that his story was not believable.  Quin stated that he thought the money was from drug proceeds and that Mele was going to Los Angeles to purchase more drugs.  He informed Mele that the money was therefore being seized and he gave Mele a receipt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The next day Mele arrived at the DEA office with his attorney.  He was unable to provide sufficient documentation to show that the valium was validly prescribed to him, as Quin had demanded.  One of the agents noticed Bucci waiting outside in the car while Mele and his attorney were in the office.  Later that day, the seized money was placed in a bag and, along with several other similar bags, was presented to a narcotics-detection dog.  To use the jargon of the genre, the dog \"alerted\" to the bag containing the money.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mele mounts two separate attacks.  First, he contends that the government's entire case must fail because the initial seizure of the money, as well as much of the questioning, was tainted by a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  Alternatively, he disputes the existence of probable cause at the forfeiture stage, which the government must show in order to forfeit the money.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review here is de novo for two reasons.  The district court's grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo.  Wood v. Clemons, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196882\"><a href=\"/opinion/196882/wood-v-mcc-superintendant/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996).  Additionally, the Supreme Court held last term that review by the courts of appeals of conclusions as to whether there had been a violation of the Fourth Amendment is de novo.  Ornelas v.

This stop, he says, lacked the reasonable and articulable suspicion necessary to justify it.  See generally Terry v. Ohio, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Further, he contends, the stop became a de facto arrest because of its duration and because of the nature of the place to which he was taken by the agents.  The probable cause necessary to uphold an arrest, he argues, is similarly lacking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government affidavits say that Mele went with the agents to the DEA field office voluntarily and that he was not told the money would be seized until some time after they had arrived at the office.  Mele, on such evidence, plainly consented to going to the DEA office, and his Fourth Amendment arguments are baseless.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  There are no colorable Fourth Amendment concerns where an officer simply asks a few questions to a civilian, who voluntarily allows the encounter to continue.

West Side Building Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698685\"><a href=\"/opinion/698685/united-states-v-all-assets-and-equipment-of-west-side-building-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span>, 1188 n. 13 (7th Cir.1995) (comparing the two standards and endorsing \"nexus\" standard);  United States v.

The facts adduced here are more than adequate to establish a \"substantial connection.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> A traveler taking a normal route from Saugus to the airport, which is southeast of Saugus, would not pass through Medford, which is southwest of Saugus</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Contrary to the government's argument, however, there is little significance in the fact that Mele's cash was \"concealed,\" i.e., that it he carried it in a fanny pack.  Few people carry money, especially large sums, in any way other than \"concealed.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We do not, however, agree with the Second Circuit's suggestion that \"[i]t may well be that through the byzantine world of forfeiture law, [C]ongress and the courts have implicitly created a rebuttable presumption that the possession of large amounts of cash is per se evidence of illegal activity.\" $37,780, 920 F.2d at 162</p>\n        <p>As for Mele's cash purchase of the ticket, this has limited probative value.  But see United States v.

The designation by the government of Los Angeles as a \"known source city\" for narcotics is also of little importance.  See United States v. Glover, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578612\"><a href=\"/opinion/578612/united-states-v-reginald-glover/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span>, 1017 (2d Cir.1992) (Oakes, C.J., dissenting) (\"As cases too numerous to cite have pointed out, 'source cities,' as testified to by law enforcement officers, include virtually every city in the United States of any size....  'Source city' is essentially a meaningless term.\").</p>\n        <p>Like the factors discounted by the Supreme Court in Reid v.
