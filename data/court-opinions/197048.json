BACKGROUND\r                                    I.  BACKGROUND\r\n\n          Following  a four  day trial,  a jury  found defendant-\r\n\nappellant Daniel G. Sullivan guilty of receiving a stolen firearm\r\n\nafter previously having been convicted  of a felony (\"Count  I\"),\r\n\naiding and abetting the sale of stolen firearms (\"Count II\"), and\r\n\naiding and abetting  the sale  of firearms to  a convicted  felon\r\n\n(\"Count  III\").  Finding that  Sullivan had been  convicted of at\r\n\nleast three  prior crimes of  violence or serious  drug offenses,\r\n\nthe district court sentenced Sullivan as an armed career criminal\r\n\npursuant to U.S.S.G.   4B1.4.  The  court imposed prison terms of\r\n\n188 months  on Count I  and 120 months  on each of Counts  II and\r\n\nIII,  to  be  served  concurrently, with  five  years  supervised\r\n\nrelease thereafter.\r\n\n          Sullivan challenges the district  court's determination\r\n\nof  his status as an armed career  criminal for the first time on\r\n\nappeal,  a fact that Sullivan concedes  in his brief.  He alleges\r\n\nno error  with respect  to the  offense of  conviction, sometimes\r\n\nreferred  to  as the  \"triggering  offense.\"   See,  e.g., United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v.  Bell, 966 F.2d 703, 705 n.5 (1st Cir. 1992).  Instead,\r                         \r\n\nSullivan  attacks the  district  court's use  of his  prior state\r\n\ncourt  convictions as  predicate  offenses for  the armed  career\r\n\ncriminal  determination on two fronts.  For the reasons set forth\r\n\nbelow,  this court  rejects  each of  Sullivan's contentions  and\r\n\naffirms the district court's sentence.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\n                         II.  DISCUSSION\r                                   II.  DISCUSSION\r\n\n                      A.  Standard of Review\r                                A.  Standard of Review\r                                                      \r\n\n          At  the outset,  it  is incumbent  upon  this court  to\r\n\ndelineate the correct standard of its review.  It is well-settled\r\n\nin this circuit that arguments which an appellant failed to raise\r\n\nin  contemporaneous objections below are effectively forfeited on\r\n\nappeal and reversible only  if an appellant can  establish \"plain\r\n\nerror.\"   United States  v. Winter,  70 F.3d  655, 659  (1st Cir.\r                                            \r\n\n1995),  cert. denied,  116 S.  Ct. 1366  (1996); see  also United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.  Alzanki, 54  F.3d 994,  1003  (1st Cir.  1995), cert.\r                                                                           \r\n\ndenied, 116 S. Ct. 909 (1996); United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d\r                                                                 \r\n\n97,  100 (1st Cir.),  cert. denied, 484  U.S. 844 (1987).   Under\r                                            \r\n\nthis standard, an  appellant must establish:  \"(1) 'error,' i.e.,\r                                                                          \r\n\na '[d]eviation from a legal rule'; (2) that  the error is 'plain'\r\n\nor 'obvious';  and (3) that the plain error affected 'substantial\r\n\nrights.'\"    United States  v. Winter,  70  F.3d at  659 (quoting\r                                               \r\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993)).  Regardless of\r                                \r\n\nwhether an appellant bears this  burden, however, the decision to\r\n\ncorrect the error is entirely discretionary.  See id.  We proceed\r                                                               \r\n\nto address Sullivan's two arguments in light of these principles.\r\n\n                B.  Sufficiency of the Indictment\r                          B.  Sufficiency of the Indictment\r                                                           \r\n\n          Sullivan's first argument  concerns the sufficiency  of\r\n\nthe indictment under which  he was charged.  Sullivan  avers that\r\n\nthe  list of his prior  state court convictions  contained in the\r\n\nindictment did not  contain three  convictions valid  for use  as\r\n\npredicate offenses under the  Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"),\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\n18  U.S.C.    924.   A  thorough  examination of  the  indictment\r\n\nundercuts this argument, however.\r\n\n          The indictment lists  a number  of Sullivan's  previous\r\n\nconvictions,  ranging from  simple  drug possession  in 1970,  to\r\n\nburglary in  1983.  Sullivan does not challenge the use of two of\r\n\nthese convictions, the burglary  conviction on May 18, 1983,  and\r\n\none on October 29, 1992  for arson, as predicate offenses.1   The\r\n\nissue  raised  on   appeal  is  whether  any  of   the  remaining\r\n\nconvictions were valid for use as a third predicate offense.\r\n\n          With  respect  to  this  issue,  Sullivan  devotes  the\r\n\nmajority  of  his  efforts  to   arguing  why  his  several  drug\r\n\nconvictions, a conviction for possession of bomb materials, and a\r\n\ngeneric  conspiracy  conviction   are  inadequate  to   serve  as\r\n\npredicate offenses.  We need not address these contentions.\r\n\n          The presentence  report reveals that Sullivan  had four\r                                                                           \r\n\nprior  state court burglary convictions,  not one, as  he and the\r\n\nindictment suggest.   This  inconsistency is attributable  to the\r\n\nfact that the convictions were consolidated for sentencing in the\r\n\nstate court in  which Sullivan was tried.  It  is clear, however,\r\n\nthat the burglaries took place  on different dates, involved four\r\n\ndifferent victims, and involved four distinct sentences.\r\n\n          It  is well-settled  in  this circuit  and others  that\r\n\ncrimes  which   were  committed  on  different   dates,  involved\r\n\ndifferent  locations, and  targeted different  victims are  to be\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n1  Sullivan declines to do so for good reason:  the term \"violent\r\nfelony\"  is defined by statute to include the crimes of arson and\r\nburglary.  See 18 U.S.C.   924(e)(2)(B).\r                        \r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\ntreated as  distinct for  purposes of 18  U.S.C.    924(e).   See\r                                                                           \r\n\nUnited States v. Riddle, 47 F.3d 460, 462 (1st Cir. 1995); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.  Lewis, 40  F.3d 1325,  1346  (1st Cir.  1994); United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates  v.  Godinez,  998  F.2d  471,  472-73  (7th  Cir.  1993).\r                             \r\n\nAccordingly,  any three of  the five prior  state convictions for\r\n\nburglary  or arson  could have  served as the  predicate offenses\r\n\nnecessary to sentence Sullivan as an armed career criminal.\r\n\n          Any  argument that  Sullivan did  not receive  adequate\r\n\nnotice that the government intended  to seek an enhancement under\r\n\nthe  ACCA   because  the  four  burglary   convictions  were  not\r\n\ndelineated  in the  indictment must  also fail  for two  reasons.\r\n\nFirst,  the government  \"need  not allege  in the  indictment the\r\n\nthree  prior felonies that it  will use to  enhance a defendant's\r\n\nsentence under    924(e)(1).\"   United States v.  Tracy, 36  F.3d\r                                                                 \r\n\n187, 198 (1st Cir.  1994), cert. denied, 115 S.  Ct. 1717 (1995);\r                                                 \r\n\nsee also United  States v. Rumney, 867 F.2d 714,  719 (1st Cir.),\r                                           \r\n\ncert.  denied, 491 U.S. 908 (1989).   Second, notwithstanding the\r                       \r\n\ngovernment's failure to elucidate  the specific felonies it would\r\n\nuse as predicate crimes, it did announce its intention to seek an\r\n\nenhanced sentence under  the ACCA  in both the  indictment and  a\r\n\ntrial brief filed  prior to  commencement of trial.   See  United\r                                                                           \r\n\nStates v. Tracy,  36 F.3d at  198; United  States v. Rumney,  867\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.2d at 716.  Accordingly, we find no plain error with respect to\r\n\nthis issue.\r\n\n                 C.  Restoration of Civil Rights\r                           C.  Restoration of Civil Rights\r                                                          \r\n\n          Sullivan's  second argument  is  grounded in  18 U.S.C.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\n  921(a)(20).  This section provides that \"[a]ny conviction which\r\n\nhas been  expunged, or set aside  or for which a  person has been\r\n\npardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered\r\n\na  conviction for  purposes of  [the ACCA],  unless  such pardon,\r\n\nexpungement, or  restoration of civil  rights expressly  provides\r\n\nthat the  person may  not ship,  transport,  possess, or  receive\r\n\nfirearms.\"   18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20).  Sullivan relies on the fact\r\n\nthat various laws enacted by the  State of Maine between 1975 and\r\n\n1981  served to restore the civil rights that had previously been\r\n\ndenied to those convicted of felony offenses.\r\n\n          Civil  rights generally encompass  \"the right  to vote,\r\n\nthe right to seek and hold  public office, and the right to serve\r\n\non a jury.\"  United States v. Caron, 77 F.3d 1,  2 (1st Cir.) (en\r                                             \r\n\nbanc),  cert. denied, 116  S. Ct. 2569  (1996).  At  one point in\r                              \r\n\ntime, the State of Maine denied these rights to felons.  In 1975,\r\n\nhowever, Maine reversed course and restored these rights.  At the\r\n\ntime of  Sullivan's state  court arson and  burglary convictions,\r\n\nthe  restoration  effort by  Maine  was  complete:   felons  were\r\n\npermitted to  vote, hold office, and  serve on a jury.   As such,\r\n\nSullivan  invites  us to  provide  a  favorable response  to  the\r\n\nquestion left open  in this  circuit by Caron,  that is,  whether\r                                                       \r\n\ncivil  rights  which  have  never  actually  been  forfeited  can\r\n\nnonetheless be \"restored.\"\r\n\n          We  need  not  answer  this   question  here,  however.\r\n\nSection  921(a)(20)  provides that  a conviction  may serve  as a\r\n\npredicate offense under the ACCA notwithstanding the  restoration\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\nof civil rights theretofore  forfeited if the restoration statute\r\n\nimposes  a  restriction  on  the felon's  ability  to  possess  a\r\n\nfirearm.  18 U.S.C.   921(a)(20).  While the restoration statutes\r\n\nenacted  by  Maine did  not include  an  explicit restraint  on a\r\n\nfelon's  ability to  possess  a firearm,  such restrictions  were\r\n\nalready in  place in Maine.   See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.  tit. 15,  \r                                           \r\n\n393 (West 1995);2 see  generally Passamaquoddy Tribe v.  State of\r                                                                           \r\n\nMaine,  75 F.3d  784,  789  (1st  Cir.  1996).    Therefore,  the\r               \r\n\nstatutory restrictions imposed on a  felon's ability to possess a\r\n\nfirearm in Maine  afford Sullivan no  relief from the  sentencing\r\n\nenhancements of the ACCA.\r\n\n          We  think it  is unnecessary  to elaborate  because our\r\n\nreading of  the statute  is that  followed by  a majority of  the\r\n\ncircuits that  have spoken to  the need  to read state  law as  a\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n2  This statute provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\n          1.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following a four day trial, a jury found defendant-appellant Daniel G. Sullivan guilty of receiving a stolen firearm after previously having been convicted of a felony (\"Count I\"), aiding and abetting the sale of stolen firearms (\"Count II\"), and aiding and abetting the sale of firearms to a convicted felon (\"Count III\").  Finding that Sullivan had been convicted of at least three prior crimes of violence or serious drug offenses, the district court sentenced Sullivan as an armed career criminal pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.4.  The court imposed prison terms of 188 months on Count I and 120 months on each of Counts II and III, to be served concurrently, with five years supervised release thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan challenges the district court's determination of his status as an armed career criminal for the first time on appeal, a fact that Sullivan concedes in his brief.  He alleges no error with respect to the offense of conviction, sometimes referred to as the \"triggering offense.\"   See, e.g., United States v. Bell, 966 F.2d 703, 705 n. 5 (1st Cir.1992).  Instead, Sullivan attacks the district court's use of his prior state court convictions as predicate offenses for the armed career criminal determination on two fronts.  For the reasons set forth below, this court rejects each of Sullivan's contentions and affirms the district court's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p>A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, it is incumbent upon this court to delineate the correct standard of its review.  It is well-settled in this circuit that arguments which an appellant failed to raise in contemporaneous objections below are effectively forfeited on appeal and reversible only if an appellant can establish \"plain error.\"  United States v. Winter, 70 F.3d 655, 659 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1366, 134 L.Ed.2d 532 (1996);  see also United States v. Alzanki, 54 F.3d 994, 1003 (1st Cir.1995), cert. denied, U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 909, 133 L.Ed.2d 841 (1996);  United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 844, 108 S.Ct. 137, 98 L.Ed.2d 94 (1987).  Under this standard, an appellant must establish:  \"(1) 'error,' i.e., a '[d]eviation from a legal rule';  (2) that the error is 'plain' or 'obvious';  and (3) that the plain error affected 'substantial rights.' \"  United States v. Winter, 70 F.3d at 659 (quoting United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776-77, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).  Regardless of whether an appellant bears this burden, however, the decision to correct the error is entirely discretionary.  See id.   We proceed to address Sullivan's two arguments in light of these principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sufficiency of the Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan's first argument concerns the sufficiency of the indictment under which he was charged.  Sullivan avers that the list of his prior state court convictions contained in the indictment did not contain three convictions valid for use as predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924.  A thorough examination of the indictment undercuts this argument, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment lists a number of Sullivan's previous convictions, ranging from simple drug possession in 1970, to burglary in 1983.  Sullivan does not challenge the use of two of these convictions, the burglary conviction on May 18, 1983, and one on October 29, 1992 for arson, as predicate offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  The issue raised on appeal is whether any of the remaining convictions were valid for use as a third predicate offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to this issue, Sullivan devotes the majority of his efforts to arguing why his several drug convictions, a conviction for possession of bomb materials, and a generic conspiracy conviction are inadequate to serve as predicate offenses.  We need not address these contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report reveals that Sullivan had four prior state court burglary convictions, not one, as he and the indictment suggest.  This inconsistency is attributable to the fact that the convictions were consolidated for sentencing in the state court in which Sullivan was tried.  It is clear, however, that the burglaries took place on different dates, involved four different victims, and involved four distinct sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-settled in this circuit and others that crimes which were committed on different dates, involved different locations, and targeted different victims are to be treated as distinct for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).  See United States v. Riddle, 47 F.3d 460, 462 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v. Lewis, 40 F.3d 1325, 1346 (1st Cir.1994);  United States v. Godinez, 998 F.2d 471, 472-73 (7th Cir.1993).  Accordingly, any three of the five prior state convictions for burglary or arson could have served as the predicate offenses necessary to sentence Sullivan as an armed career criminal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any argument that Sullivan did not receive adequate notice that the government intended to seek an enhancement under the ACCA because the four burglary convictions were not delineated in the indictment must also fail for two reasons.  First, the government \"need not allege in the indictment the three prior felonies that it will use to enhance a defendant's sentence under &#167; 924(e)(1).\"  United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 187, 198 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 1717, 131 L.Ed.2d 576 (1995);  see also United States v. Rumney, 867 F.2d 714, 719 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 491 U.S. 908, 109 S.Ct. 3194, 105 L.Ed.2d 702 (1989).  Second, notwithstanding the government's failure to elucidate the specific felonies it would use as predicate crimes, it did announce its intention to seek an enhanced sentence under the ACCA in both the indictment and a trial brief filed prior to commencement of trial.  See United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d at 198;  United States v. Rumney, 867 F.2d at 716.   Accordingly, we find no plain error with respect to this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Restoration of Civil Rights</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan's second argument is grounded in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  This section provides that \"[a]ny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of [the ACCA], unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  Sullivan relies on the fact that various laws enacted by the State of Maine between 1975 and 1981 served to restore the civil rights that had previously been denied to those convicted of felony offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Civil rights generally encompass \"the right to vote, the right to seek and hold public office, and the right to serve on a jury.\"  United States v. Caron, 77 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.)  (en banc), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 2569, 135 L.Ed.2d 1085 (1996).  At one point in time, the State of Maine denied these rights to felons.  In 1975, however, Maine reversed course and restored these rights.  At the time of Sullivan's state court arson and burglary convictions, the restoration effort by Maine was complete:  felons were permitted to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury.  As such, Sullivan invites us to provide a favorable response to the question left open in this circuit by Caron, that is, whether civil rights which have never actually been forfeited can nonetheless be \"restored.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not answer this question here, however.  Section 921(a)(20) provides that a conviction may serve as a predicate offense under the ACCA notwithstanding the restoration of civil rights theretofore forfeited if the restoration statute imposes a restriction on the felon's ability to possess a firearm.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  While the restoration statutes enacted by Maine did not include an explicit restraint on a felon's ability to possess a firearm, such restrictions were already in place in Maine.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &#167; 393 (West 1995);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  see generally Passamaquoddy Tribe v. State of Maine, 75 F.3d 784, 789 (1st Cir.1996).  Therefore, the statutory restrictions imposed on a felon's ability to possess a firearm in Maine afford Sullivan no relief from the sentencing enhancements of the ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is unnecessary to elaborate because our reading of the statute is that followed by a majority of the circuits that have spoken to the need to read state law as a whole.  Indeed, apart from the District of Columbia Circuit, see United States v. Bost, 87 F.3d 1333 (D.C.Cir.1996), every circuit court that has addressed the issue appears to have taken the approach that we follow here.  See United States v. Burns, 934 F.2d 1157, 1159-61 (10th Cir.1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1124, 112 S.Ct. 1246, 117 L.Ed.2d 478 (1992);  United States v. McLean, 904 F.2d 216, 218 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 875, 111 S.Ct. 203, 112 L.Ed.2d 164 (1990);  United States v. Erwin, 902 F.2d 510, 513 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 859, 111 S.Ct. 161, 112 L.Ed.2d 127 (1990);  United States v. Cassidy, 899 F.2d 543, 549 (6th Cir.1990);  cf. United States v. Gmez, 911 F.2d 219, 221-22 (9th Cir.1990).  We reserve decision on a further question, which appears to have divided the circuits more closely, as to whether a firearm restriction in a state statute would be sufficient in a case where the defendant received a document such as a pardon or a certificate that purported to restore all civil rights but did not expressly mention any restrictions with respect to firearms.  See United States v. Erwin, 902 F.2d at 512-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, the district court properly used the state arson and burglary convictions as predicate offenses for purposes of determining his sentence pursuant to the ACCA.  We find no plain error.III.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993)).  Regardless of whether an appellant bears this burden, however, the decision to correct the error is entirely discretionary.  See id.   We proceed to address Sullivan's two arguments in light of these principles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sufficiency of the Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan's first argument concerns the sufficiency of the indictment under which he was charged.  Sullivan avers that the list of his prior state court convictions contained in the indictment did not contain three convictions valid for use as predicate offenses under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"), 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924.  A thorough examination of the indictment undercuts this argument, however.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The indictment lists a number of Sullivan's previous convictions, ranging from simple drug possession in 1970, to burglary in 1983.  Sullivan does not challenge the use of two of these convictions, the burglary conviction on May 18, 1983, and one on October 29, 1992 for arson, as predicate offenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>  The issue raised on appeal is whether any of the remaining convictions were valid for use as a third predicate offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to this issue, Sullivan devotes the majority of his efforts to arguing why his several drug convictions, a conviction for possession of bomb materials, and a generic conspiracy conviction are inadequate to serve as predicate offenses.  We need not address these contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The presentence report reveals that Sullivan had four prior state court burglary convictions, not one, as he and the indictment suggest.  This inconsistency is attributable to the fact that the convictions were consolidated for sentencing in the state court in which Sullivan was tried.  It is clear, however, that the burglaries took place on different dates, involved four different victims, and involved four distinct sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well-settled in this circuit and others that crimes which were committed on different dates, involved different locations, and targeted different victims are to be treated as distinct for purposes of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(e).  See United States v. Riddle, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195912\"><a href=\"/opinion/195912/united-states-v-riddle/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></a></span>, 462 (1st Cir.1995);  United States v.

Godinez, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610967\"><a href=\"/opinion/610967/united-states-v-ricardo-a-godinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 472-73 (7th Cir.1993).  Accordingly, any three of the five prior state convictions for burglary or arson could have served as the predicate offenses necessary to sentence Sullivan as an armed career criminal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Any argument that Sullivan did not receive adequate notice that the government intended to seek an enhancement under the ACCA because the four burglary convictions were not delineated in the indictment must also fail for two reasons.  First, the government \"need not allege in the indictment the three prior felonies that it will use to enhance a defendant's sentence under &#167; 924(e)(1).\"  United States v. Tracy, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195627\"><a href=\"/opinion/195627/united-states-v-tracy/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 198 (1st Cir.1994), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></span> (1989).  Second, notwithstanding the government's failure to elucidate the specific felonies it would use as predicate crimes, it did announce its intention to seek an enhanced sentence under the ACCA in both the indictment and a trial brief filed prior to commencement of trial.  See United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d at 198;  United States v. Rumney, 867 F.2d at 716.   Accordingly, we find no plain error with respect to this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Restoration of Civil Rights</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sullivan's second argument is grounded in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  This section provides that \"[a]ny conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of [the ACCA], unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.\"  18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  Sullivan relies on the fact that various laws enacted by the State of Maine between 1975 and 1981 served to restore the civil rights that had previously been denied to those convicted of felony offenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Civil rights generally encompass \"the right to vote, the right to seek and hold public office, and the right to serve on a jury.\"  United States v. Caron, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713036\"><a href=\"/opinion/713036/united-states-v-gerald-r-caron/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.)  (en banc), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2569</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1085</span></span> (1996).  At one point in time, the State of Maine denied these rights to felons.  In 1975, however, Maine reversed course and restored these rights.  At the time of Sullivan's state court arson and burglary convictions, the restoration effort by Maine was complete:  felons were permitted to vote, hold office, and serve on a jury.  As such, Sullivan invites us to provide a favorable response to the question left open in this circuit by Caron, that is, whether civil rights which have never actually been forfeited can nonetheless be \"restored.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not answer this question here, however.  Section 921(a)(20) provides that a conviction may serve as a predicate offense under the ACCA notwithstanding the restoration of civil rights theretofore forfeited if the restoration statute imposes a restriction on the felon's ability to possess a firearm.  18 U.S.C. &#167; 921(a)(20).  While the restoration statutes enacted by Maine did not include an explicit restraint on a felon's ability to possess a firearm, such restrictions were already in place in Maine.  See Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 15, &#167; 393 (West 1995);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  see generally Passamaquoddy Tribe v. State of Maine, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196568\"><a href=\"/opinion/196568/passamaquoddy-tribe-v-state-of-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span>, 789 (1st Cir.1996).  Therefore, the statutory restrictions imposed on a felon's ability to possess a firearm in Maine afford Sullivan no relief from the sentencing enhancements of the ACCA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think it is unnecessary to elaborate because our reading of the statute is that followed by a majority of the circuits that have spoken to the need to read state law as a whole.  Indeed, apart from the District of Columbia Circuit, see United States v. Bost, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721287\"><a href=\"/opinion/721287/united-states-v-michael-t-bost/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1333</span></a></span> (D.C.Cir.1996), every circuit court that has addressed the issue appears to have taken the approach that we follow here.

We reserve decision on a further question, which appears to have divided the circuits more closely, as to whether a firearm restriction in a state statute would be sufficient in a case where the defendant received a document such as a pardon or a certificate that purported to restore all civil rights but did not expressly mention any restrictions with respect to firearms.
