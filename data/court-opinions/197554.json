This case  raises questions\r                      LYNCH,  Circuit Judge.\r                                           \r\n\nunder the Contract  Clause of the United  States Constitution\r\n\nconcerning  a  government's   power  to  regulate   insurance\r\n\ncompanies facing insolvency by barring claims asserted  after\r\n\na particular date by insureds.  If that power is upheld, then\r\n\nDr.  Fernandez is  essentially uninsured  on  the malpractice\r\n\nclaim and  it  may be  that the  malpractice plaintiffs  will\r\n\nrecover nothing regardless of the merits of their claim.  \r\n\n          Manuel Mercado-Boneta brought a medical malpractice\r\n\naction against Dr. Elliot Fernandez and  Fernandez's insurer,\r\n\nthe Patient's Compensation Fund Administration (\"PCFA\").  Dr.\r\n\nFernandez  also claimed  over against PCFA.   PCFA  moved for\r\n\ndismissal  on the  grounds that,  inter alia,  PCFA had  been\r                                                        \r\n\ndissolved  by an  act of  the legislature  and was  no longer\r\n\nliable on  Dr. Fernandez's  insurance policy.   The  district\r\n\ncourt granted the  motion.  Dr. Fernandez  and Mercado-Boneta\r\n\nappeal jointly from that  dismissal, arguing that the act  of\r\n\nthe  legislature violates the  Contract Clause of  the United\r\n\nStates  Constitution.   We find no  constitutional violation,\r\n\nand affirm.\r\n\n                              I.\r\n\n          During  the  time of  the alleged  malpractice, Dr.\r\n\n                             -2-\r                                          2\r\r\n\nFernandez  was covered by  PCFA under an  occurrence policy.1\r\n\nHowever, PCFA was  abolished before Mercado-Boneta filed  his\r\n\nclaim  against  Dr.  Fernandez.2    The  Legislature  of  the\r\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico abrogated PCFA by Act of Dec. 30,\r\n\n1986, Act  No. 4, 1986 P.R.  Laws 869 (\"Act No.  4\"), stating\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n1.    An  occurrence  policy,  which  provides  coverage  for\r\noccurrences within the  policy period regardless of  when the\r\nclaim  is made, is  distinguished from a  claims-made policy,\r\nwhich only  covers the insured  for claims that  are actually\r\nmade during the policy period.  \r\n\n2.  Manuel Mercado-Boneta and  his wife  Milagros Molina,  on\r\nbehalf of their minor daughter Veronica Mercado-Molina, filed\r\ntheir medical malpractice claim against Dr. Fernandez and his\r\ninsurance  companies on  June 24,  1992,  almost eight  years\r\nafter the alleged malpractice.  Veronica was  born on January\r\n1, 1983,  and was  treated by Dr.  Fernandez from  that point\r\nuntil the end of  June, 1984.  Plaintiffs' complaint  alleges\r\nthat Veronica developed  a high fever in early  1984, and was\r\ntaken  several   times  to   Dr.  Fernandez  who   prescribed\r\nmedications,  but  refused  to  hospitalize  Veronica.    Not\r\nsatisfied with  Dr. Fernandez's treatment of  their daughter,\r\nplaintiffs took Veronica to another physician who immediately\r\nhospitalized the child.  Plaintiffs allege that Dr. Fernandez\r\nwas  negligent  in failing  to  properly diagnose  Veronica's\r\ncondition and in failing to hospitalize her.  They claim that\r\nDr. Fernandez's negligence caused  Veronica to suffer  severe\r\nphysical  disability and  emotional  distress, including  the\r\npermanent loss of  approximately 75% of  her hearing in  both\r\nears, speech impairment, loss of future income, and emotional\r\nproblems  associated with  living with  a physical  handicap.\r\n(Plaintiff's  complaint,  appendix  pp.  36-37).   Plaintiffs\r\nallege  total  damages in  the  amount  of $1,600,000.    Dr.\r\nFernandez denies the allegations  of negligence, and  submits\r\nthat Veronica's hearing  impairment was the likely  result of\r\nhead trauma Veronica  suffered when she fell from  a slide in\r\nJanuary  of  1986.    The record  is  sparse  regarding  when\r\nplaintiffs  first  became  aware of  Veronica's  hearing  and\r\nspeech  problems.  It appears, however,  that they were aware\r\nof  the   problem  by   August  of   1986,  when   Veronica's\r\npediatrician  referred   her  to  a  hearing  specialist  for\r\nevaluation  of possible hearing  impairment.  (report  of Dr.\r\nZapata, record)\r\n\n                             -3-\r                                          3\r\r\n\nthat  PCFA was not adequately fulfilling its intended purpose\r\n\nand was  at risk of  imminent insolvency.  The  operations of\r\n\nPCFA were endangered and the insureds and their patients were\r\n\nat  risk of not being  compensated for their  losses.  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n871 (\"Statement of Motives\").\r\n\n          Despite  the  legislature's  dissolution  of  PCFA,\r\n\nMercado-Boneta  sued PCFA3 as  an insurer of  Dr. Fernandez.4\r\n\nPCFA  moved for  dismissal on  the grounds  that it  had been\r\n\ndissolved  by Act  No.  4,  that it  lacked  funds to  assume\r\n\nfinancial responsibility for  claims, and that it  was immune\r\n\nfrom suit in Federal Court under the Eleventh Amendment.  The\r\n\ndistrict court granted PCFA's motion to dismiss on the  first\r\n\nground alone.  The court found that PCFA was legally extinct,\r\n\nand that Act No. 4 did not permit the Insurance Commissioner,\r\n\nas PCFA's legal representative, to honor claims filed against\r\n\nPCFA  subsequent to  its  abolition  on  December  30,  1986.\r\n\nBecause Mercado-Boneta filed his claim against  Dr. Fernandez\r\n\nlater  than December 30, 1986, the Insurance Commissioner was\r\n\nheld  not responsible to  Dr. Fernandez for  any liability he\r\n\nincurred as  a result of  Mercado-Boneta's claim.   The court\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n3.  Act  No. 4 directs  the Insurance Commissioner  of Puerto\r\nRico to represent  PCFA in matters pending before  PCFA or in\r\nactions involving PCFA in the courts.    Act No. 4,   3, 1986\r\nP.R. Laws 871, 885.   As a result, the Insurance Commissioner\r\nrepresents PCFA in this action.\r\n\n4.  The  law  of Puerto  Rico  permits  a  plaintiff  to  sue\r\ndefendant's liability  insurer  directly.   26 L.P.R.A.  sec.\r\n2003.\r\n\n                             -4-\r                                          4\r\r\n\nalso  found that PCFA's  successor for certain  purposes, the\r\n\nInsurers' Syndicate, was not responsible for any claims filed\r\n\nagainst PCFA.\r\n\n          Both  Mercado-Boneta and  Dr.  Fernandez moved  for\r\n\nreconsideration of the dismissal of PCFA on the  grounds that\r\n\nAct No. 4, as interpreted by the district court, violated the\r\n\nContract  Clause  of  the United  States  Constitution.   The\r\n\ndistrict court held that although Act No. 4 did substantially\r\n\nimpair a contractual  obligation, the Act was  reasonable and\r\n\nnecessary  to an important  public purpose, and  thus did not\r\n\nviolate the Contract Clause. \r\n\n                             II.\r\n\n                              A.\r\n\n          As   an  initial  matter,  we  note  that  we  have\r\n\njurisdiction to  resolve the merits  of this case.   PCFA has\r\n\nraised this issue on appeal.  PCFA argues that  because it is\r\n\nan  \"arm  of  the  state,\"   and  because  the  suit  is  one\r\n\npotentially involving  money damages, the  Eleventh Amendment\r\n\nbars a federal court from hearing this claim against it.  The\r\n\nparties  raised this  issue in the  district court,  but that\r\n\ncourt did not reach the  issue, disposing of the suit against\r\n\nPCFA on other grounds.  Whether PCFA is an \"arm of the state\"\r\n\nfor Eleventh Amendment (or, for that matter, Contract Clause)\r\n\npurposes  is a difficult  question.  Because  we readily find\r\n\n                             -5-\r                                          5\r\r\n\nthat Act No. 4 bars suit against PCFA for claims filed  after\r\n\nDec. 30, 1986, and  that such a result  does not violate  the\r\n\nContract   Clause,   we   pretermit    resolution   of   this\r\n\njurisdictional issue.   See Norton v. Mathews,  427 U.S. 524,\r                                                         \r\n\n530-32 (1976) (where merits can be readily resolved  in favor\r\n\nof the  party challenging jurisdiction, resolution of complex\r\n\njurisdictional  issue may be  avoided); Birbara v.  Locke, 99\r                                                                     \r\n\nF.3d 1233, 1237 (1st Cir. 1996).\r\n\n                              B.\r\n\n          We  review  de  novo orders  allowing  a  motion to\r                                          \r\n\ndismiss for failure  to state a claim.   Aulson v. Blanchard,\r                                                                        \r\n\n83 F.3d 1, 3  (1st Cir. 1996).   It is clear,  constitutional\r\n\nissues  aside, that Act  No. 4  bars the  claims of  both Dr.\r\n\nFernandez  and Mercado-Boneta.   At  the  time that  Mercado-\r\n\nBoneta brought his  malpractice claim against Dr.  Fernandez,\r\n\nthe  Legislature of  the  Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  had\r\n\nexpressly abolished PCFA  by Act No. 4, and  replaced it with\r\n\nthe Insurers' Syndicate.   Act No. 4  at   3, 1986  P.R. Laws\r\n\n871, 885.   PCFA was no longer legally  capable of fulfilling\r\n\nits obligations under the insurance policy.  The Act  further\r\n\nprovided that the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico would\r\n\noversee  the  implementation of  the  newly  formed Insurers'\r\n\nSyndicate, \"it being understood, that the Syndicate shall not\r\n\nassume financial responsibility for any claims filed  against\r\n\n                             -6-\r                                          6\r\r\n\nthe  abolished Patient's  Compensation Fund  Administration.\"\r\n\nId.  According to  the plain  language of  this statute,  the\r               \r\n\nInsurers' Syndicate was not the successor in interest of PCFA\r\n\nfor purposes of assuming PCFA's liabilities, and could not be\r\n\nheld liable for claims arising under policies issued by PCFA.\r\n\n          Nor could the Insurance Commissioner be held liable\r\n\nas  PCFA's  representative  for  claims  filed  against  PCFA\r\n\nsubsequent to  the enactment of Act No.  4.  Although the Act\r\n\nprovides that the Insurance Commissioner shall continue to be\r\n\nresponsible  for claims and procedures initiated with PCFA on\r\n\nor before the  enactment of Act No. 4,  it makes no provision\r\n\nfor claims filed with  PCFA after the enactment of Act No. 4.\r\n\nId.   Act No.  4 exempts PCFA  from liability  on malpractice\r               \r\n\nclaims filed after  December 30, 1986, through  the Insurers'\r\n\nSyndicate, the Insurance Commissioner, or otherwise. \r\n\n                             C. \r\n\n          Mercado-Boneta5  and Dr.  Fernandez argue  that Act\r\n\nNo. 4  nonetheless violates the  prohibition in Article  1,  \r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n5.  Mercado-Boneta lacks standing to assert a Contract Clause\r\nclaim, as he has no  contractual relationship with PCFA.  See\r                                                                         \r\nGeneral Motors  v.

Dr. Fernandez does have\r\nstanding, however, so we analyze the issue.  \r\n\n                             -7-\r                                          7\r\r\n\n10, cl. 1 of the United States Constitution, that \"[n]o state\r\n\nshall . .  . pass any .  . . law impairing  the obligation of\r\n\ncontracts. .  . .\"  Mercado-Boneta and  Fernandez assert that\r\n\nunder Dr. Fernandez's  occurrence policy with PCFA,  PCFA was\r\n\ncontractually obligated to reimburse Dr. Fernandez for future\r\n\nclaims  arising out of  negligent acts which  occurred during\r\n\nthe time the policy was  in effect.  They argue  that because\r\n\nAct No.  4 prevents them  from seeking performance  from PCFA\r\n\nunder  the  contract,   the  Act   substantially  impairs   a\r\n\ncontractual  obligation.  They further contend that Act No. 4\r\n\nis  not reasonable  and  necessary  to  an  important  public\r\n\npurpose.  \r\n\n          The threshold  issue in Contract Clause analysis is\r\n\n\"whether  the  change  in  state  law  has  'operated   as  a\r\n\nsubstantial  impairment  of   a  contractual  relationship.'\"\r\n\nGeneral  Motors  Corporation  v.

Although deference  is\r\n\ndue  to  the  legislature,  and   weight  is  given  to   the\r\n\nlegislature's own  statement of purposes for the law, a court\r\n\nmust undertake its  own independent inquiry to  determine the\r\n\nreasonableness of the  law and the importance of  the purpose\r\n\nbehind it.  As noted in  McGrath, \"a state must do more  than\r                                            \r\n\nmouth the  vocabulary of  the public weal  in order  to reach\r\n\nsafe harbor . . . .\"  88 F.3d at 16.  \r\n\n          Because  the  parties  do not  raise  the  issue on\r\n\nappeal,  we assume arguendo that  a contract between PCFA and\r\n\nDr. Fernandez indeed existed.6   The parties also agree  that\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n6.  We note, however, that in Contract Clause analysis, where\r\nthe state  or a  state  agency is  a party  to the  allegedly\r\nimpaired  contract, the  existence  of a  contract  is not  a\r\nmatter of state contract law, but  of federal law. It is  not\r\nclear whether appellants  seek to characterize PCFA as an arm\r\nof the state or as a  private insurance company.  If PCFA  is\r\nviewed as  an arm  of the state,  in order  to find  that the\r\nstate has committed itself to a contractual obligation, there\r\nmust be a \"clear  indication that the legislature intends  to\r\nbind itself  in a  contractual manner.\"   Parker  v.

The Court found that because the parties were operating\r\n\nin  a heavily regulated  industry, and could  readily foresee\r\n\nfuture  regulation  involving  the  subject  matter of  their\r\n\ncontract,  their expectations  under  the contract  were  not\r\n\nsignificantly affected.

Dr.  Fernandez was  aware,  when he\r\n\ncontracted with PCFA for medical malpractice  insurance, that\r\n\nthe subject matter of the contract might well undergo further\r\n\nregulation, including potential cancellation of the  contract\r\n\nin the  event of  PCFA's insolvency. See  Veix v.

Just  as the\r\n\nlegislature created PCFA  because of an insurance  crisis, it\r\n\nwas reasonable to expect that the legislature could terminate\r\n\nPCFA's existence in  the event that PCFA did  not fulfill its\r\n\npurposes,  or a  new crisis  ensued.   This  is exactly  what\r\n\ntranspired,  and we  do not  believe that  these  events were\r\n\nunforeseeable.  \r\n\n          Whether  or not there  is a substantial contractual\r\n\nimpairment7 involved in  this case, we  find, turning to  the\r\n\n                    \r                                \r\n\n7.  Dr.  Fernandez  correctly  points out  the  dangers  that\r\nContract Clause analysis  would be enervated if the mere fact\r\nof regulation meant  there was always foreseeability  of more\r\nregulation and thus no substantial  impairment.  We need  not\r\ndecide  whether there was  indeed a  \"substantial\" impairment\r\nhere, given  the ease of  the analysis of  the Commonwealth's\r\njustifications for any impairment.   In that context, we note\r\nthat such an impairment  was foreseeable, and that,  in turn,\r\nhas some bearing  on the level of scrutiny to which Act No. 4\r\nis subjected.

To  achieve  its  goals,  the\r\n\nlegislature  created  two  insurance  structures:  the  Joint\r\n\nUnderwriting Association (\"JUA\") and PCFA.   Id.

PCFA was to  be funded by\r                                     \r\n\npremiums imposed on the insured, in much the same manner that\r\n\nprivate insurance companies are funded.\r\n\n          Neither  the  JUA  nor  PCFA  proved  effective  in\r\n\nachieving the Commonwealth's  goals.  In enacting  Act No. 4,\r\n\nthe  Commonwealth sought  to  eradicate  both structures  and\r\n\ncreate  a  new,  improved   insurance  structure  called  the\r\n\nInsurers'  Syndicate.  We  quote, as did  the District Court,\r\n\nfrom the \"Statement of Motives\" in Act No. 4:\r\n\n               It   has   been  proven   that   the\r\n          Patient's Compensation  Fund has  serious\r\n          faults which  sooner or later  shall make\r\n          it a totally inoperative system.  It does\r\n          not have  an adequate  capital structure,\r\n          so  that it lacks  the resources  to face\r\n          adverse fluctuations in  loss occurrence.\r\n          The  mechanism of  the  demand which  the\r\n          Fund has to cover operational deficits is\r\n          inadequate because the  law establishes a\r\n          maximum   limit    to   the    additional\r\n          contribution  that  can  be levied  in  a\r\n          fiscal year.  \r\n               On the other  hand, if contingencies\r\n          occur such  as a high  incidence (even in\r\n          the  case  of losses  under  the $150,000\r\n\n                             -14-\r                                          14\r\r\n\n          limit)  or high  severity, especially  in\r\n          limits  between  one  hundred  and  fifty\r\n          thousand  ($150,000)  and   five  hundred\r\n          thousand  ($500,000)  dollars,  the  Fund\r\n          could   find   itself   without  adequate\r\n          resources to absorb its  losses.  In view\r\n          of the  ascending trend in  the incidence\r\n          and   severity   of   the   losses,   the\r\n          postponement   of    the   payment    for\r\n          subsequent   fiscal   years   could  only\r\n          endanger the  Fund's operations  for said\r\n          years and bring about the protests of the\r\n          insured (because  of high costs)  and the\r\n          victims  who   will  not   receive  their\r\n          payment in time.\r\n\nId. at 871.   The  legislature reasonably  concluded that  if\r               \r\n\nPCFA  were  not   dissolved,  it  would  continue   to  incur\r\n\nliabilities and  obligations which  it would  not be  able to\r\n\nmeet.  Under Contract Clause analysis, a court must  consider\r\n\nwhether  the  proposed  justification in  fact  serves public\r                                                                         \r\n\ninterests and whether its mechanisms to serve those interests\r\n\nreflect reasonable and necessary choices.  \r                                            \r\n\n          Act No.  4  is in  stark contrast  to the  narrowly\r\n\nfocused,  private interest-oriented law  that was struck down\r\n\nin Allied Structural Steel Company v.

The  Supreme Court  there  invalidated a  law which\r\n\nmandated  certain  pension  rights  for  certain   employees,\r\n\nregardless  of what  the individual  employment contracts  or\r\n\npension plans  provided, because  the law  had an  \"extremely\r\n\nnarrow focus,\"  and  was  not  enacted \"to  protect  a  broad\r\n\nsocietal interest rather than a narrow class.\"  Id. at 248-49\r                                                               \r\n\n(The law \"applies only to private employers who have at least\r\n\n                             -15-\r                                          15\r\r\n\n100 employees, at  least one of whom works  in Minnesota, and\r\n\nwho have established voluntary private  pension plans . . . .\r\n\nAnd  it  applies  only  when  such  an  employer  closes  his\r\n\nMinnesota  office  or  terminates  his  pension  plan.\").

And  the\r                                            \r\n\nreasonableness inquiry  requires a determination that the law\r\n\nis \"reasonable  in light  of the  surrounding circumstances.\"\r\n\nId.  The Supreme Court has indicated that different levels of\r               \r\n\ndeference are afforded  to a  legislature's determination  of\r\n\nreasonableness  and  necessity,  depending  on  whether   the\r\n\ncontracts at issue are public or private in nature.

(state assessment of  necessity and reasonableness\r\n\nis  given less  deference where its  own self-interest  is at\r\n\nstake).   If the  state has in  fact altered none  of its own\r\n\nfinancial obligations, then the legislative decision deserves\r\n\nsignificant deference because the state is essentially acting\r\n\nnot according to its economic interests, but  pursuant to its\r\n\npolice powers.     \r\n\n          The  question then, is  whether and to  what extent\r\n\nthe   Commonwealth  of  Puerto  Rico  has  lessened  its  own\r\n\nfinancial obligations by abrogating PCFA.  The answer is that\r\n\nit has not done  so at all.   The Commonwealth created  PCFA,\r\n\nbut empowered  it to  act as  an ordinary  insurance company.\r\n\nPCFA  entered  into  insurance contracts  and  conducted  its\r\n\naffairs as a  more or less independent entity,  overseen by a\r\n\nboard of directors.  Act of May 30, 1976, Act No. 74, sec. 1,\r\n\n  41.050(2), 1976 P.R. Laws 223, 228-29 (\"Act No. 74\").  PCFA\r\n\nderived its funds from premiums imposed  on the insureds, Act\r\n\nNo. 74, at  sec. 1,    41.050(1)(b), 41.060, and  there is no\r\n\nindication  that the  Commonwealth ever  intended  to utilize\r\n\nstate funds to  satisfy any of PCFA's  insurance obligations.\r\n\nIn  fact,  Act No.  74 provided  that in  the event  that the\r\n\namount of money contributed to PCFA by the insureds were \"not\r\n\nsufficient to  meet  the  claims made  against  [PCFA]  in  a\r\n\nspecific  year,\" the  Commonwealth  would not  contribute any\r\n\n                             -18-\r                                          18\r\r\n\nfunds, but  rather  \"the Board  [of  PCFA would]  require  an\r\n\nadditional proportionate contribution of all the participants\r\n\nfor that fiscal year.\" Id. at   41.060(4).  By creating PCFA,\r                                      \r\n\nthe Commonwealth sought not to  provide state funds to insure\r\n\nmedical  professionals, but  merely to  set  up an  insurance\r\n\nscheme  that would  provide the  proper setting  in  which to\r\n\nresolve  the medical  malpractice insurance  crisis that  was\r\n\noccurring at  the time.   Because the Commonwealth  was never\r\n\nobligated to fund  PCFA, when PCFA  began to fail it  was the\r\n\npublic welfare,  not  the Commonwealth's  bank account,  that\r\n\nstood to lose.  \r\n\n          Act No. 4 was plainly reasonable and necessary.  In\r\n\nChicago Life  Ins. Co. v.  Needles, 113 U.S. 574  (1885), the\r                                              \r\n\nSupreme  Court  upheld  against   Contract  Clause  attack  a\r\n\nlegislative  decision  to  liquidate  an insolvent  insurance\r\n\ncompany.  In that case, the Court stated:\r\n\n          But  can it be  possible that  the state,\r\n          which  brought   this  corporation   into\r\n          existence for  the purpose  of conducting\r\n          the  business   of  life   insurance,  is\r\n          powerless to  protect the  people against\r\n          it, when . . . its further continuance in\r\n          business would  defeat the object  of its\r\n          creation, and be a fraud upon the public,\r\n          and on its  creditors and policy-holders?\r\n          .  . .  The [law  in  question] does  not\r\n          contain  any  regulation  respecting  the\r\n          affairs  of any  corporation of  Illinois\r\n          which is not reasonable in its character,\r\n          or   which  is   not  promotive   of  the\r\n          interests   of  all   concerned  in   its\r\n          management.\r\n\n                             -19-\r                                          19\r\r\n\nId. at 582.   In response to  the claim that the  liquidation\r               \r\n\nviolated  the  contract rights  of policy-holders,  the Court\r\n\nnoted that \"it  would be a doctrine  new in the law  that the\r\n\nexistence of  a private  contract of  the corporation  should\r\n\nforce upon  it a perpetuity  of existence contrary  to public\r\n\npolicy,  and the nature and objects  of its charter.\"  Id. at\r                                                                      \r\n\n584.   \r\n\n          That the  Act itself  was reasonable  and necessary\r\n\ndoes not end the analysis.  In the end, Dr.  Fernandez's real\r\n\ncomplaint is that, because of  the claims bar date, his claim\r\n\nis not among those which will be  funded out of the wind-down\r\n\nof  PCFA.    In  an   attempt  to  limit  the  financial  and\r\n\nadministrative  burdens of  concluding  the  affairs  of  the\r\n\ndissolved PCFA, the legislature provided that existing claims\r\n\nwould  be honored,  while claims  filed with  PCFA  after the\r\n\nenactment of Act No. 4  would not.  Although this legislative\r\n\nsolution may appear unfair  to those physicians who paid  for\r\n\noccurrence policies with PCFA and whose  claims were not made\r\n\nwith PCFA before the claims bar date, it was not unreasonable\r\n\nunder the circumstances.   In a  sense, Act No.  4 sought  to\r\n\naccomplish a sort of legislative triage.   That is, it sought\r\n\nto make  an equitable  distribution of  limited resources  by\r\n\nproviding for existing, but not future claims. \r\n\n          The  Commonwealth   did  not   impose  \"a   drastic\r\n\nimpairment when  an evident  and more  moderate course  would\r\n\n                             -20-\r                                          20\r\r\n\nserve its purposes  equally well.\"  United States  Trust Co.,\r                                                                        \r\n\n431 U.S.  at 31.   We  cannot say  that the Commonwealth  was\r\n\nobligated  to fund PCFA until all potential occurrence claims\r\n\nhad  been filed, regardless of PCFA's imminent insolvency and\r\n\ninefficacy.   What the legislature  has done in this  case is\r\n\nnot unlike the situation in bankruptcy wherein creditors must\r\n\nfile   their  claims  against  a  debtor's  estate  within  a\r\n\nrelatively short  time period in  order to have  their claims\r\n\nrecognized.  See  Rule of Bankr.Proc.  3002(c) (in chapter  7\r                            \r\n\nliquidation proof of claims shall  be filed within 90 days of\r\n\ncreditors'  meeting).  The time limitations for filing claims\r\n\nagainst a bankrupt  have been held to create  an absolute bar\r\n\nagainst asserting the  claim, rather than merely  an issue of\r\n\npriority.   See, e.g.,  Robinson v. Mann,  339 F.2d  547, 549\r                                                    \r\n\n(5th Cir. 1964)  (time limitations for filing  claims against\r\n\ndebtor's estate \"operate as an absolute bar against creditors\r\n\nwho seek  to present their  claims beyond the  [bar date].\");\r\n\nNorris Grain Co. v.

The\r\n\nlegislature assigned  to the Insurance Commissioner  the task\r\n\nof liquidating PCFA and distributing its assets.  There was a\r\n\nstrong interest  in  rapidly resolving  and  quantifying  all\r\n\nclaims  against PCFA.

In re Schaffer,\r                                                                        \r\n\n173 B.R. at  398 (\"If creditors of any  stripe were permitted\r\n\nto file claims at their discretion . . . .

In  addition   to  the\r\n\nadministrative  difficulties   involved  in   permitting  the\r\n\ncontinued filing of claims  against PCFA, due to  the limited\r\n\navailability of funds,  known claimants might be  required to\r\n\nawait the filing  of future claims before  they could collect\r\n\non their own.

It was reasonable  for the legislature to  set a\r\n\ncut-off  date after which time  claims against PCFA would not\r\n\nbe honored, and Dr. Fernandez's  claim fell on the wrong side\r\n\nof that line.

The court also found that PCFA's successor for certain purposes, the Insurers' Syndicate, was not responsible for any claims filed against PCFA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Mercado-Boneta and Dr. Fernandez moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of PCFA on the grounds that Act No. 4, as interpreted by the district court, violated the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution.  The district court held that although Act No. 4 did substantially impair a contractual obligation, the Act was reasonable and necessary to an important public purpose, and thus did not violate the Contract Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As an initial matter, we note that we have jurisdiction to resolve the merits of this case. PCFA has raised this issue on appeal.  PCFA argues that because it is an \"arm of the state,\" and because the suit is one potentially involving money damages, the Eleventh Amendment bars a federal court from hearing this claim against it.  The parties raised this issue in the district court, but that court did not reach the issue, disposing of the suit against PCFA on other grounds.  Whether PCFA is an \"arm of the state\" for Eleventh Amendment (or, for that matter, Contract Clause) purposes is a difficult question.  Because we readily find that Act No. 4 bars suit against PCFA for claims filed after Dec. 30, 1986, and that such a result does not violate the Contract Clause, we pretermit resolution of this jurisdictional issue.  See Norton v. Mathews, 427 U.S. 524, 530-32, 96 S.Ct. 2771, 2774-76, 49 L.Ed.2d 672 (1976) (where merits can be readily resolved in favor of the party challenging jurisdiction, resolution of complex jurisdictional issue may be avoided);  Birbara v. Locke, 99 F.3d 1233, 1237 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo orders allowing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.  Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1996).  It is clear, constitutional issues aside, that Act No. 4 bars the claims of both Dr. Fernandez and Mercado-Boneta.  At the time that Mercado-Boneta brought his malpractice claim against Dr. Fernandez, the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had expressly abolished PCFA by Act No. 4, and replaced it with the Insurers' Syndicate.  Act No. 4 at &#167; 3, 1986 P.R. Laws 871, 885.  PCFA was no longer legally capable of fulfilling its obligations under the insurance policy.  The Act further provided that the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico would oversee the implementation of the newly formed Insurers' Syndicate, \"it being understood, that the Syndicate shall not assume financial responsibility for any claims filed against the abolished Patient's Compensation Fund Administration.\"  Id. According to the plain language of this statute, the Insurers' Syndicate was not the successor in interest of PCFA for purposes of assuming PCFA's liabilities, and could not be held liable for claims arising under policies issued by PCFA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor could the Insurance Commissioner be held liable as PCFA's representative for claims filed against PCFA subsequent to the enactment of Act No. 4. Although the Act provides that the Insurance Commissioner shall continue to be responsible for claims and procedures initiated with PCFA on or before the enactment of Act No. 4, it makes no provision for claims filed with PCFA after the enactment of Act No. 4. Id.  Act No. 4 exempts PCFA from liability on malpractice claims filed after December 30, 1986, through the Insurers' Syndicate, the Insurance Commissioner, or otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mercado-Boneta<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and Dr. Fernandez argue that Act No. 4 nonetheless violates the prohibition in Article 1, &#167; 10, cl. 1 of the United States Constitution, that \"[n]o state shall ... pass any ... law impairing the obligation of contracts....\"  Mercado-Boneta and Fernandez assert that under Dr. Fernandez's occurrence policy with PCFA, PCFA was contractually obligated to reimburse Dr. Fernandez for future claims arising out of negligent acts which occurred during the time the policy was in effect.  They argue that because Act No. 4 prevents them from seeking performance from PCFA under the contract, the Act substantially impairs a contractual obligation.  They further contend that Act No. 4 is not reasonable and necessary to an important public purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The threshold issue in Contract Clause analysis is \"whether the change in state law has 'operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.' \"  General Motors Corporation v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1105, 1109, 117 L.Ed.2d 328 (1991) (quoting Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234, 244, 98 S.Ct. 2716, 2722, 57 L.Ed.2d 727 (1978)).  This inquiry is broken down into three distinct parts:  \"whether there is a contractual relationship, whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship, and whether the impairment is substantial.\"  Id. If we find that a law does substantially impair a contractual relationship, we will nevertheless uphold the law if it is \"reasonable and necessary to an important public purpose.\"  United States Trust Company of New York v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 25, 97 S.Ct. 1505, 1519, 52 L.Ed.2d 92 (1976);  see also McGrath v. Rhode Island Retirement Board, 88 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1996) (citing Energy Reserves Group v.

This inquiry is more searching than the rational basis review employed in Due Process or Equal Protection analysis.  Although deference is due to the legislature, and weight is given to the legislature's own statement of purposes for the law, a court must undertake its own independent inquiry to determine the reasonableness of the law and the importance of the purpose behind it.  As noted in McGrath, \"a state must do more than mouth the vocabulary of the public weal in order to reach safe harbor....\"  88 F.3d at 16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the parties do not raise the issue on appeal, we assume arguendo that a contract between PCFA and Dr. Fernandez indeed existed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  The parties also agree that Act No. 4 impairs the contractual relationship between PCFA and Dr. Fernandez, and that that impairment is substantial, under the second and third prongs of the analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to whether any impairment is substantial, we note that in Contract Clause analysis, the expectations of the parties to the alleged contract play an important role in determining the substantiality of the contractual impairment.  Energy Reserves Group v. Kansas Power and Light Co., 459 U.S. 400, 416, 103 S.Ct. 697, 707, 74 L.Ed.2d 569 (the complaining party's reasonable expectations had not been impaired by a statute, and so the statute did not violate the Contract Clause, although it altered the parties' obligations).  A key factor in determining the parties' expectations is whether the parties were operating in a heavily regulated industry.  Id. at 411, 103 S.Ct. at 704 (\"In determining the extent of the impairment, we are to consider whether the industry the complaining party has entered has been regulated in the past.\")  (citing Allied Structural Steel Co., 438 U.S. at 242, n. 13, 98 S.Ct. at 2721, n. 13).   In Energy Reserves, the Supreme Court held that a Kansas statute imposing certain regulations on oil and gas contracts did not impair existing contractual obligations between an oil company and a public utility.  459 U.S. at 416, 103 S.Ct. at 707.   The Court found that because the parties were operating in a heavily regulated industry, and could readily foresee future regulation involving the subject matter of their contract, their expectations under the contract were not significantly affected.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties here were also in a heavily regulated context.  Insurance companies in Puerto Rico operate under the highly detailed and comprehensive Insurance Code of Puerto Rico. 26 L.P.R.A. &#167; 201 et seq.  Among its numerous and extensive provisions, the Code permits the Insurance Commissioner to liquidate insolvent insurance companies and establish procedures for the resolution of claims against the company.  26 L.P.R.A. &#167;&#167; 4002, 4008, 4019.  The breadth of Puerto Rico's regulation of the insurance industry was acknowledged in Gonzalez v. Media Elements, Inc., 946 F.2d 157 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Puerto Rico has constructed a comprehensive framework for the liquidation of insolvent insurance companies and the resolution of claims against them.\");   see also Garcia v. Island Program Designer, 791 F.Supp. 338, 341, rev'd on other grounds, 4 F.3d 57 (1st Cir.1993) (noting that the Puerto Rico insurance scheme is \"an intricate and highly specialized administrative system, adopted by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to regulate the life of insurance companies from incorporation to dissolution....  [It] provides a comprehensive program for the rehabilitation and liquidation of domestic insurance companies....\").  Dr. Fernandez was aware, when he contracted with PCFA for medical malpractice insurance, that the subject matter of the contract might well undergo further regulation, including potential cancellation of the contract in the event of PCFA's insolvency.  See Veix v. Sixth Ward Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 310 U.S. 32, 38, 60 S.Ct. 792, 795, 84 L.Ed. 1061 (1940) (noting that when one \"purchase[s] into an enterprise already regulated in the particular to which he now objects, he purchase[s] subject to further legislation upon the same topic.\").  Just as the legislature created PCFA because of an insurance crisis, it was reasonable to expect that the legislature could terminate PCFA's existence in the event that PCFA did not fulfill its purposes, or a new crisis ensued.  This is exactly what transpired, and we do not believe that these events were unforeseeable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not there is a substantial contractual impairment<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> involved in this case, we find, turning to the fourth part of the Contract Clause analysis, that Act No. 4 was reasonable and necessary to an important public purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although apparently absolute on its face, \"[t]he Contract Clause's prohibition of any state law impairing the obligation of contracts must be accommodated to the State's inherent police power to safeguard the vital interests of its people.\"  Energy Reserves, 459 U.S. at 410, 103 S.Ct. at 704.

The legislature originally created PCFA in 1976, to \"solve the problem of medical and hospital malpractice risks.\"   Act No. 4, 1986 P.R. Laws 869, 869 (\"Statement of Motives\").  To achieve its goals, the legislature created two insurance structures:  the Joint Underwriting Association (\"JUA\") and PCFA.  Id. The JUA was \"composed of all insurers licensed to contract accident insurance in Puerto Rico, and its purpose was to provide medicohospital professional liability insurance for medical professionals and health service institutions that could not obtain said insurance on the open market.\"  Id. The goal of the JUA was to distribute profits and losses evenly among all insurance underwriters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth established the second insurance structure, PCFA, to \"provide medicohospital professional liability coverage in excess of seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) per claim, furnished by the market and/or the Association, up to a limit of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).\"  Id. at 870.   PCFA was to be funded by premiums imposed on the insured, in much the same manner that private insurance companies are funded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the JUA nor PCFA proved effective in achieving the Commonwealth's goals.  In enacting Act No. 4, the Commonwealth sought to eradicate both structures and create a new, improved insurance structure called the Insurers' Syndicate.  We quote, as did the District Court, from the \"Statement of Motives\" in Act No. 4:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been proven that the Patient's Compensation Fund has serious faults which sooner or later shall make it a totally inoperative system.  It does not have an adequate capital structure, so that it lacks the resources to face adverse fluctuations in loss occurrence.  The mechanism of the demand which the Fund has to cover operational deficits is inadequate because the law establishes a maximum limit to the additional contribution that can be levied in a fiscal year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, if contingencies occur such as a high incidence (even in the case of losses under the $150,000 limit) or high severity, especially in limits between one hundred and fifty thousand ($150,000) and five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars, the Fund could find itself without adequate resources to absorb its losses.  In view of the ascending trend in the incidence and severity of the losses, the postponement of the payment for subsequent fiscal years could only endanger the Fund's operations for said years and bring about the protests of the insured (because of high costs) and the victims who will not receive their payment in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 871.   The legislature reasonably concluded that if PCFA were not dissolved, it would continue to incur liabilities and obligations which it would not be able to meet.  Under Contract Clause analysis, a court must consider whether the proposed justification in fact serves public interests and whether its mechanisms to serve those interests reflect reasonable and necessary choices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Act No. 4 is in stark contrast to the narrowly focused, private interest-oriented law that was struck down in Allied Structural Steel Company v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234, 98 S.Ct. 2716, 57 L.Ed.2d 727 (1978).  The Supreme Court there invalidated a law which mandated certain pension rights for certain employees, regardless of what the individual employment contracts or pension plans provided, because the law had an \"extremely narrow focus,\" and was not enacted \"to protect a broad societal interest rather than a narrow class.\"  Id. at 248-49, 98 S.Ct. at 2724 (The law \"applies only to private employers who have at least 100 employees, at least one of whom works in Minnesota, and who have established voluntary private pension plans....  And it applies only when such an employer closes his Minnesota office or terminates his pension plan.\").  The Commonwealth was not legislating on behalf of private interests when it enacted Act No. 4, and sought only to protect the legitimate interests of the public in having a well-functioning medical malpractice insurance system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The necessity analysis inquires whether the Commonwealth \"impose[d] a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate course would serve its purposes equally well.\"  United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 31, 97 S.Ct. at 1522.   And the reasonableness inquiry requires a determination that the law is \"reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances.\"  Id. The Supreme Court has indicated that different levels of deference are afforded to a legislature's determination of reasonableness and necessity, depending on whether the contracts at issue are public or private in nature.  See U.S. Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 25-26, 97 S.Ct. at 1519-20.   If the contract is a private one, then \"[a]s is customary in reviewing economic and social regulation, ... courts properly defer to legislative judgment as to the necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure.\"  United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 22-23, 97 S.Ct. at 1518.   On the other hand, \"[w]here the contract allegedly impaired is one created, or entered into, by the state itself, less deference<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> to a legislative determination of reasonableness and necessity is required, because 'the State's self-interest is at stake.' \"  Parker v. Wakelin, 123 F.3d 1, 5 (quoting United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 26, 97 S.Ct. at 1519).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we find that although PCFA was created by the Commonwealth, the insurance contracts PCFA entered into were essentially more akin to private contracts than public ones.  We thus accord considerable deference to the Commonwealth's assessment of the reasonableness and necessity of Act No. 4. We believe the real issue in determining the level of deference given to a legislative determination of reasonableness and necessity is not so much whether the state is arguably a nominal party to the contract, but whether the state is acting in its own pecuniary or self-interested capacity by impairing a contractual obligation it has undertaken.  See United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 26, 97 S.Ct. at 1519 (\"If a State could reduce its financial obligations whenever it wanted to spend the money for what it regarded as an important public purpose, the Contract Clause would provide no protection at all.\");  Parker v. Wakelin, 123 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.1997) (state assessment of necessity and reasonableness is given less deference where its own self-interest is at stake).  If the state has in fact altered none of its own financial obligations, then the legislative decision deserves significant deference because the state is essentially acting not according to its economic interests, but pursuant to its police powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question then, is whether and to what extent the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has lessened its own financial obligations by abrogating PCFA.  The answer is that it has not done so at all.  The Commonwealth created PCFA, but empowered it to act as an ordinary insurance company.  PCFA entered into insurance contracts and conducted its affairs as a more or less independent entity, overseen by a board of directors.  Act of May 30, 1976, Act No. 74, sec. 1, &#167; 41.050(2), 1976 P.R. Laws 223, 228-29 (\"Act No. 74\").  PCFA derived its funds from premiums imposed on the insureds, Act No. 74, at sec. 1, &#167;&#167; 41.050(1)(b), 41.060, and there is no indication that the Commonwealth ever intended to utilize state funds to satisfy any of PCFA's insurance obligations.  In fact, Act No. 74 provided that in the event that the amount of money contributed to PCFA by the insureds were \"not sufficient to meet the claims made against [PCFA] in a specific year,\" the Commonwealth would not contribute any funds, but rather \"the Board [of PCFA would] require an additional proportionate contribution of all the participants for that fiscal year.\"  Id. at &#167; 41.060(4).  By creating PCFA, the Commonwealth sought not to provide state funds to insure medical professionals, but merely to set up an insurance scheme that would provide the proper setting in which to resolve the medical malpractice insurance crisis that was occurring at the time.  Because the Commonwealth was never obligated to fund PCFA, when PCFA began to fail it was the public welfare, not the Commonwealth's bank account, that stood to lose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Act No. 4 was plainly reasonable and necessary.  In Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Needles, 113 U.S. 574, 5 S.Ct. 681, 28 L.Ed. 1084 (1885), the Supreme Court upheld against Contract Clause attack a legislative decision to liquidate an insolvent insurance company.  In that case, the Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>But can it be possible that the state, which brought this corporation into existence for the purpose of conducting the business of life insurance, is powerless to protect the people against it, when ... its further continuance in business would defeat the object of its creation, and be a fraud upon the public, and on its creditors and policy-holders?  ...  The [law in question] does not contain any regulation respecting the affairs of any corporation of Illinois which is not reasonable in its character, or which is not promotive of the interests of all concerned in its management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 582, 5 S.Ct. at 685.   In response to the claim that the liquidation violated the contract rights of policy-holders, the Court noted that \"it would be a doctrine new in the law that the existence of a private contract of the corporation should force upon it a perpetuity of existence contrary to public policy, and the nature and objects of its charter.\"  Id. at 584, 5 S.Ct. at 686.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the Act itself was reasonable and necessary does not end the analysis.  In the end, Dr. Fernandez's real complaint is that, because of the claims bar date, his claim is not among those which will be funded out of the wind-down of PCFA.  In an attempt to limit the financial and administrative burdens of concluding the affairs of the dissolved PCFA, the legislature provided that existing claims would be honored, while claims filed with PCFA after the enactment of Act No. 4 would not.  Although this legislative solution may appear unfair to those physicians who paid for occurrence policies with PCFA and whose claims were not made with PCFA before the claims bar date, it was not unreasonable under the circumstances.  In a sense, Act No. 4 sought to accomplish a sort of legislative triage.  That is, it sought to make an equitable distribution of limited resources by providing for existing, but not future claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth did not impose \"a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate course would serve its purposes equally well.\"  United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 31, 97 S.Ct. at 1522.   We cannot say that the Commonwealth was obligated to fund PCFA until all potential occurrence claims had been filed, regardless of PCFA's imminent insolvency and inefficacy.  What the legislature has done in this case is not unlike the situation in bankruptcy wherein creditors must file their claims against a debtor's estate within a relatively short time period in order to have their claims recognized.  See Rule of Bankr.Proc. 3002(c) (in chapter 7 liquidation proof of claims shall be filed within 90 days of creditors' meeting).  The time limitations for filing claims against a bankrupt have been held to create an absolute bar against asserting the claim, rather than merely an issue of priority.  See, e.g., Robinson v. Mann, 339 F.2d 547, 549 (5th Cir.1964) (time limitations for filing claims against debtor's estate \"operate as an absolute bar against creditors who seek to present their claims beyond the [bar date].\");  Norris Grain Co. v. United States, 81 B.R. 103, 106 (Bkrtcy.M.D.Fl.1987) (claims bar date is 'in the nature of a statute of limitations [which] must be strictly observed.' )  (quoting In re Kay Homes Inc., 57 B.R. 967, 971 (Bkrtcy.S.D.Tex.1986) (alterations in original)).  The purpose behind the claims bar date in bankruptcy, as in the case before us, is \"to provide the debtor and its creditors with finality\" and to \"insure the swift distribution\" of the liquidated estate.  In re Schaffer, 173 B.R. 393, 398 (Bkrtcy.N.D.Ill.1994) (quoting In re Zimmerman, 156 B.R. 192, 199 (Bkrtcy.W.D.Mich.1993)).  See also In re Kolstad, 928 F.2d 171, 173 (5th Cir.1991) (\"The deadlines have a purpose:  they enable a debtor and his creditors to know, reasonably promptly, what parties are making claims against the estate and in what general amounts.\").  \"[A]lthough aware that a bar date, like other limitation periods, would inevitably cause hardship on those who failed to act timely, Congress decided that the goal of finality is of greater benefit to the public than any benefit derived from allowing individual exceptions to the bar date.\"  Norris Grain Co., 81 B.R. at 106 (citing Hoos &amp; Co. v. Dynamics Corporation of America, 570 F.2d 433, 439 (2d Cir.1978));  see also Hoos &amp; Co., 570 F.2d at 439 (noting that permitting bankruptcy court to consider allowing late claims in individual cases would \"put the bankruptcy courts in the unenviable position of indefinitely having to consider claims\" and that such a scenario \"would destroy the objective of finality which Congress obviously intended to promote.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same principles are involved here.  The legislature assigned to the Insurance Commissioner the task of liquidating PCFA and distributing its assets.  There was a strong interest in rapidly resolving and quantifying all claims against PCFA.  If the Insurance Commissioner were required to accept claims against the liquidated PCFA indefinitely that would clearly contravene the legitimate legislative goal of finality, and could well delay distribution of funds to any claimant. Cf. In re Schaffer, 173 B.R. at 398 (\"If creditors of any stripe were permitted to file claims at their discretion....  Many estates would be impossible to administer.\").  In addition to the administrative difficulties involved in permitting the continued filing of claims against PCFA, due to the limited availability of funds, known claimants might be required to await the filing of future claims before they could collect on their own.  Absent a claims bar date, neither the affairs of PCFA nor the interests of pending claims could be finalized.  It was reasonable for the legislature to set a cut-off date after which time claims against PCFA would not be honored, and Dr. Fernandez's claim fell on the wrong side of that line.  We recognize that this places Dr. Fernandez, Mercado-Boneta, and others like them in an unfortunate situation.

Veronica was born on January 1, 1983, and was treated by Dr. Fernandez from that point until the end of June, 1984.  Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that Veronica developed a high fever in early 1984, and was taken several times to Dr. Fernandez who prescribed medications, but refused to hospitalize Veronica.  Not satisfied with Dr. Fernandez's treatment of their daughter, plaintiffs took Veronica to another physician who immediately hospitalized the child.  Plaintiffs allege that Dr. Fernandez was negligent in failing to properly diagnose Veronica's condition and in failing to hospitalize her.  They claim that Dr. Fernandez's negligence caused Veronica to suffer severe physical disability and emotional distress, including the permanent loss of approximately 75% of her hearing in both ears, speech impairment, loss of future income, and emotional problems associated with living with a physical handicap.  (Plaintiff's complaint, appendix pp. 36-37).  Plaintiffs allege total damages in the amount of $1,600,000.  Dr. Fernandez denies the allegations of negligence, and submits that Veronica's hearing impairment was the likely result of head trauma Veronica suffered when she fell from a slide in January of 1986.  The record is sparse regarding when plaintiffs first became aware of Veronica's hearing and speech problems.  It appears, however, that they were aware of the problem by August of 1986, when Veronica's pediatrician referred her to a hearing specialist for evaluation of possible hearing impairment.

Dr. Fernandez also claimed over against PCFA.  PCFA moved for dismissal on the grounds that, inter alia, PCFA had been dissolved by an act of the legislature and was no longer liable on Dr. Fernandez's insurance policy.  The district court granted the motion.  Dr. Fernandez and Mercado-Boneta appeal jointly from that dismissal, arguing that the act of the legislature violates the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution.

The district court granted PCFA's motion to dismiss on the first ground alone.  The court found that PCFA was legally extinct, and that Act No. 4 did not permit the Insurance Commissioner, as PCFA's legal representative, to honor claims filed against PCFA subsequent to its abolition on December 30, 1986.  Because Mercado-Boneta filed his claim against Dr. Fernandez later than December 30, 1986, the Insurance Commissioner was held not responsible to Dr. Fernandez for any liability he incurred as a result of Mercado-Boneta's claim.  The court also found that PCFA's successor for certain purposes, the Insurers' Syndicate, was not responsible for any claims filed against PCFA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Mercado-Boneta and Dr. Fernandez moved for reconsideration of the dismissal of PCFA on the grounds that Act No. 4, as interpreted by the district court, violated the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution.

PCFA has raised this issue on appeal.  PCFA argues that because it is an \"arm of the state,\" and because the suit is one potentially involving money damages, the Eleventh Amendment bars a federal court from hearing this claim against it.  The parties raised this issue in the district court, but that court did not reach the issue, disposing of the suit against PCFA on other grounds.  Whether PCFA is an \"arm of the state\" for Eleventh Amendment (or, for that matter, Contract Clause) purposes is a difficult question.  Because we readily find that Act No. 4 bars suit against PCFA for claims filed after Dec. 30, 1986, and that such a result does not violate the Contract Clause, we pretermit resolution of this jurisdictional issue.

It is clear, constitutional issues aside, that Act No. 4 bars the claims of both Dr. Fernandez and Mercado-Boneta.  At the time that Mercado-Boneta brought his malpractice claim against Dr. Fernandez, the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had expressly abolished PCFA by Act No. 4, and replaced it with the Insurers' Syndicate.  Act No. 4 at &#167; 3, 1986 P.R. Laws 871, 885.  PCFA was no longer legally capable of fulfilling its obligations under the insurance policy.  The Act further provided that the Insurance Commissioner of Puerto Rico would oversee the implementation of the newly formed Insurers' Syndicate, \"it being understood, that the Syndicate shall not assume financial responsibility for any claims filed against the abolished Patient's Compensation Fund Administration.\"  Id. According to the plain language of this statute, the Insurers' Syndicate was not the successor in interest of PCFA for purposes of assuming PCFA's liabilities, and could not be held liable for claims arising under policies issued by PCFA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor could the Insurance Commissioner be held liable as PCFA's representative for claims filed against PCFA subsequent to the enactment of Act No. 4.

The legislature originally created PCFA in 1976, to \"solve the problem of medical and hospital malpractice risks.\"   Act No. 4, 1986 P.R. Laws 869, 869 (\"Statement of Motives\").  To achieve its goals, the legislature created two insurance structures:  the Joint Underwriting Association (\"JUA\") and PCFA.  Id. The JUA was \"composed of all insurers licensed to contract accident insurance in Puerto Rico, and its purpose was to provide medicohospital professional liability insurance for medical professionals and health service institutions that could not obtain said insurance on the open market.\"  Id. The goal of the JUA was to distribute profits and losses evenly among all insurance underwriters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth established the second insurance structure, PCFA, to \"provide medicohospital professional liability coverage in excess of seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000) per claim, furnished by the market and/or the Association, up to a limit of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($150,000).\"  Id. at 870.   PCFA was to be funded by premiums imposed on the insured, in much the same manner that private insurance companies are funded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the JUA nor PCFA proved effective in achieving the Commonwealth's goals.  In enacting Act No. 4, the Commonwealth sought to eradicate both structures and create a new, improved insurance structure called the Insurers' Syndicate.  We quote, as did the District Court, from the \"Statement of Motives\" in Act No. 4:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It has been proven that the Patient's Compensation Fund has serious faults which sooner or later shall make it a totally inoperative system.  It does not have an adequate capital structure, so that it lacks the resources to face adverse fluctuations in loss occurrence.  The mechanism of the demand which the Fund has to cover operational deficits is inadequate because the law establishes a maximum limit to the additional contribution that can be levied in a fiscal year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, if contingencies occur such as a high incidence (even in the case of losses under the $150,000 limit) or high severity, especially in limits between one hundred and fifty thousand ($150,000) and five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars, the Fund could find itself without adequate resources to absorb its losses.  In view of the ascending trend in the incidence and severity of the losses, the postponement of the payment for subsequent fiscal years could only endanger the Fund's operations for said years and bring about the protests of the insured (because of high costs) and the victims who will not receive their payment in time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 871.   The legislature reasonably concluded that if PCFA were not dissolved, it would continue to incur liabilities and obligations which it would not be able to meet.  Under Contract Clause analysis, a court must consider whether the proposed justification in fact serves public interests and whether its mechanisms to serve those interests reflect reasonable and necessary choices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Act No. 4 is in stark contrast to the narrowly focused, private interest-oriented law that was struck down in Allied Structural Steel Company v.

The Supreme Court there invalidated a law which mandated certain pension rights for certain employees, regardless of what the individual employment contracts or pension plans provided, because the law had an \"extremely narrow focus,\" and was not enacted \"to protect a broad societal interest rather than a narrow class.\"  Id. at 248-49, 98 S.Ct. at 2724 (The law \"applies only to private employers who have at least 100 employees, at least one of whom works in Minnesota, and who have established voluntary private pension plans....  And it applies only when such an employer closes his Minnesota office or terminates his pension plan.\").  The Commonwealth was not legislating on behalf of private interests when it enacted Act No. 4, and sought only to protect the legitimate interests of the public in having a well-functioning medical malpractice insurance system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The necessity analysis inquires whether the Commonwealth \"impose[d] a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate course would serve its purposes equally well.\"  United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 31, 97 S.Ct. at 1522.   And the reasonableness inquiry requires a determination that the law is \"reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances.\"  Id. The Supreme Court has indicated that different levels of deference are afforded to a legislature's determination of reasonableness and necessity, depending on whether the contracts at issue are public or private in nature.  See U.S. Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 25-26, 97 S.Ct. at 1519-20.   If the contract is a private one, then \"[a]s is customary in reviewing economic and social regulation, ... courts properly defer to legislative judgment as to the necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure.\"  United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 22-23, 97 S.Ct. at 1518.   On the other hand, \"[w]here the contract allegedly impaired is one created, or entered into, by the state itself, less deference<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> to a legislative determination of reasonableness and necessity is required, because 'the State's self-interest is at stake.' \"  Parker v. Wakelin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197501\"><a href=\"/opinion/197501/parker-v-wakelin/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (quoting United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 26, 97 S.Ct. at 1519).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, we find that although PCFA was created by the Commonwealth, the insurance contracts PCFA entered into were essentially more akin to private contracts than public ones.  We thus accord considerable deference to the Commonwealth's assessment of the reasonableness and necessity of Act No. 4. We believe the real issue in determining the level of deference given to a legislative determination of reasonableness and necessity is not so much whether the state is arguably a nominal party to the contract, but whether the state is acting in its own pecuniary or self-interested capacity by impairing a contractual obligation it has undertaken.  See United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 26, 97 S.Ct. at 1519 (\"If a State could reduce its financial obligations whenever it wanted to spend the money for what it regarded as an important public purpose, the Contract Clause would provide no protection at all.\");  Parker v. Wakelin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197501\"><a href=\"/opinion/197501/parker-v-wakelin/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997) (state assessment of necessity and reasonableness is given less deference where its own self-interest is at stake).  If the state has in fact altered none of its own financial obligations, then the legislative decision deserves significant deference because the state is essentially acting not according to its economic interests, but pursuant to its police powers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question then, is whether and to what extent the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has lessened its own financial obligations by abrogating PCFA.  The answer is that it has not done so at all.  The Commonwealth created PCFA, but empowered it to act as an ordinary insurance company.  PCFA entered into insurance contracts and conducted its affairs as a more or less independent entity, overseen by a board of directors.  Act of May 30, 1976, Act No. 74, sec. 1, &#167; 41.050(2), 1976 P.R. Laws 223, 228-29 (\"Act No. 74\").  PCFA derived its funds from premiums imposed on the insureds, Act No. 74, at sec. 1, &#167;&#167; 41.050(1)(b), 41.060, and there is no indication that the Commonwealth ever intended to utilize state funds to satisfy any of PCFA's insurance obligations.  In fact, Act No. 74 provided that in the event that the amount of money contributed to PCFA by the insureds were \"not sufficient to meet the claims made against [PCFA] in a specific year,\" the Commonwealth would not contribute any funds, but rather \"the Board [of PCFA would] require an additional proportionate contribution of all the participants for that fiscal year.\"  Id. at &#167; 41.060(4).  By creating PCFA, the Commonwealth sought not to provide state funds to insure medical professionals, but merely to set up an insurance scheme that would provide the proper setting in which to resolve the medical malpractice insurance crisis that was occurring at the time.  Because the Commonwealth was never obligated to fund PCFA, when PCFA began to fail it was the public welfare, not the Commonwealth's bank account, that stood to lose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Act No. 4 was plainly reasonable and necessary.  In Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Needles, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91317\"><a href=\"/opinion/91317/chicago-life-ins-co-v-needles/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"91317\"><a href=\"/opinion/91317/chicago-life-ins-co-v-needles/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span> (1885), the Supreme Court upheld against Contract Clause attack a legislative decision to liquidate an insolvent insurance company.  In that case, the Court stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p>But can it be possible that the state, which brought this corporation into existence for the purpose of conducting the business of life insurance, is powerless to protect the people against it, when ... its further continuance in business would defeat the object of its creation, and be a fraud upon the public, and on its creditors and policy-holders?  ...  The [law in question] does not contain any regulation respecting the affairs of any corporation of Illinois which is not reasonable in its character, or which is not promotive of the interests of all concerned in its management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 582, 5 S.Ct. at 685.   In response to the claim that the liquidation violated the contract rights of policy-holders, the Court noted that \"it would be a doctrine new in the law that the existence of a private contract of the corporation should force upon it a perpetuity of existence contrary to public policy, and the nature and objects of its charter.\"  Id. at 584, 5 S.Ct. at 686.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the Act itself was reasonable and necessary does not end the analysis.  In the end, Dr. Fernandez's real complaint is that, because of the claims bar date, his claim is not among those which will be funded out of the wind-down of PCFA.  In an attempt to limit the financial and administrative burdens of concluding the affairs of the dissolved PCFA, the legislature provided that existing claims would be honored, while claims filed with PCFA after the enactment of Act No. 4 would not.  Although this legislative solution may appear unfair to those physicians who paid for occurrence policies with PCFA and whose claims were not made with PCFA before the claims bar date, it was not unreasonable under the circumstances.  In a sense, Act No. 4 sought to accomplish a sort of legislative triage.  That is, it sought to make an equitable distribution of limited resources by providing for existing, but not future claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth did not impose \"a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate course would serve its purposes equally well.\"  United States Trust Co., 431 U.S. at 31, 97 S.Ct. at 1522.   We cannot say that the Commonwealth was obligated to fund PCFA until all potential occurrence claims had been filed, regardless of PCFA's imminent insolvency and inefficacy.  What the legislature has done in this case is not unlike the situation in bankruptcy wherein creditors must file their claims against a debtor's estate within a relatively short time period in order to have their claims recognized.  See Rule of Bankr.Proc. 3002(c) (in chapter 7 liquidation proof of claims shall be filed within 90 days of creditors' meeting).  The time limitations for filing claims against a bankrupt have been held to create an absolute bar against asserting the claim, rather than merely an issue of priority.  See, e.g., Robinson v. Mann, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"266298\"><a href=\"/opinion/266298/hughes-alonzo-robinson-v-tommy-c-mann-trustee/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span>, 549 (5th Cir.1964) (time limitations for filing claims against debtor's estate \"operate as an absolute bar against creditors who seek to present their claims beyond the [bar date].\");  Norris Grain Co. v.

The legislature assigned to the Insurance Commissioner the task of liquidating PCFA and distributing its assets.  There was a strong interest in rapidly resolving and quantifying all claims against PCFA.  If the Insurance Commissioner were required to accept claims against the liquidated PCFA indefinitely that would clearly contravene the legitimate legislative goal of finality, and could well delay distribution of funds to any claimant. Cf. In re Schaffer, 173 B.R. at 398 (\"If creditors of any stripe were permitted to file claims at their discretion....  Many estates would be impossible to administer.\").  In addition to the administrative difficulties involved in permitting the continued filing of claims against PCFA, due to the limited availability of funds, known claimants might be required to await the filing of future claims before they could collect on their own.  Absent a claims bar date, neither the affairs of PCFA nor the interests of pending claims could be finalized.  It was reasonable for the legislature to set a cut-off date after which time claims against PCFA would not be honored, and Dr. Fernandez's claim fell on the wrong side of that line.  We recognize that this places Dr. Fernandez, Mercado-Boneta, and others like them in an unfortunate situation.  We also recognize, however, the legislature's legitimate purpose in setting a claims bar date, and find that it was reasonable and necessary under the circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that Act No. 4 bars plaintiff's suit against PCFA, and that Act No. 4 does not violate the Contract Clause of the United States Constitution.

Veronica was born on January 1, 1983, and was treated by Dr. Fernandez from that point until the end of June, 1984.  Plaintiffs' complaint alleges that Veronica developed a high fever in early 1984, and was taken several times to Dr. Fernandez who prescribed medications, but refused to hospitalize Veronica.  Not satisfied with Dr. Fernandez's treatment of their daughter, plaintiffs took Veronica to another physician who immediately hospitalized the child.  Plaintiffs allege that Dr. Fernandez was negligent in failing to properly diagnose Veronica's condition and in failing to hospitalize her.  They claim that Dr. Fernandez's negligence caused Veronica to suffer severe physical disability and emotional distress, including the permanent loss of approximately 75% of her hearing in both ears, speech impairment, loss of future income, and emotional problems associated with living with a physical handicap.  (Plaintiff's complaint, appendix pp. 36-37).  Plaintiffs allege total damages in the amount of $1,600,000.  Dr. Fernandez denies the allegations of negligence, and submits that Veronica's hearing impairment was the likely result of head trauma Veronica suffered when she fell from a slide in January of 1986.  The record is sparse regarding when plaintiffs first became aware of Veronica's hearing and speech problems.  It appears, however, that they were aware of the problem by August of 1986, when Veronica's pediatrician referred her to a hearing specialist for evaluation of possible hearing impairment.

It is not clear whether appellants seek to characterize PCFA as an arm of the state or as a private insurance company.  If PCFA is viewed as an arm of the state, in order to find that the state has committed itself to a contractual obligation, there must be a \"clear indication that the legislature intends to bind itself in a contractual manner.\"  Parker v. Wakelin, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197501\"><a href=\"/opinion/197501/parker-v-wakelin/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1997).  This requirement is referred to as the \"unmistakability doctrine\".  Id. Even where the state is not alleged to be a party to the contract, the question of whether a contract exists for Contract Clause purposes is still a question of federal, rather than state law.  See General Motors v. Romein, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></span>, 187, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We need not decide whether there was indeed a \"substantial\" impairment here, given the ease of the analysis of the Commonwealth's justifications for any impairment.  In that context, we note that such an impairment was foreseeable, and that, in turn, has some bearing on the level of scrutiny to which Act No. 4 is subjected.  See Allied Structural Steel Co., 438 U.S. at 245, 98 S.Ct. at 2722-23 (\"The severity of impairment measures the height of the hurdle the state legislation must clear.\");   see  also Energy Reserves, 459 U.S. at 411, 103 S.Ct. at 704 (\"The severity of the impairment is said to increase the level of scrutiny to which the legislation will be subjected.\")  (citing Allied Structural Steel, 438 U.S. at 245, 98 S.Ct. at 2723)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> However, even where public contracts are at issue, some deference is due a legislature.
