The parties in this  case --\r                                           \r\n\nInternational  Business Machines  Corp. (IBM)  and the  400 Wyman\r\n\nStreet  Trust (the Trust)1 -- comprise  a partnership created for\r\n\nthe purpose  of developing  and operating  an office building  in\r\n\nWaltham, Massachusetts.  The Trust secured an opportunity for the\r\n\nPartnership  to reduce its debt by purchasing its own mortgage at\r\n\na substantial  discount.  IBM opposed the deal.  The issue before\r\n\nus is whether IBM's veto is absolute, or whether the dispute must\r\n\nbe arbitrated; under the  Partnership Agreement, the answer turns\r\n\non whether  the proposal involves an acquisition  of \"an interest\r\n\nin  real property\" or a \"refinancing.\"  The district court deemed\r\n\nit a  refinancing,  and  granted  the Trust's  motion  to  compel\r\n\narbitration.  See Bank  v. International Business Machines Corp.,\r                                                                          \r\n\n915  F. Supp. 491, 498 (D. Mass.  1996).  The issue is close, but\r\n\nwe  conclude  that  the  refinancing  provision  is  inapplicable\r\n\nbecause  the  proposal  that  has  been presented  so  far  lacks\r\n\nrefinancing content.  Consequently, we reverse. \r\n\n                      I. Factual Background\r                                                     \r\n\n     IBM and the  Trust entered into  the Partnership in  October\r\n\n1986.   The Partnership Agreement specifies  that the Partnership\r\n\nwould  seek to  finance  the construction  and  operation of  the\r\n\noffice  building with a non-recourse loan, and a $75 million loan\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     1 Michael D. Bank, Thomas M. Dusel and  Robert J. M. O'Hare,\r\nJr., are named  as parties in  their capacity as trustees  of the\r\nTrust.   For the sake  of convenience, we  refer to the appellees\r\nsimply as \"the Trust\" throughout the opinion.\r\n\n                               -2-\r\r\n\nimposing  no liability  on  either  party  for repayment  of  the\r\n\nprincipal was, in fact, obtained from Citicorp Real Estate, Inc.\r\n\n     The  Trust  is  the  managing partner  of  the  Partnership,\r\n\nholding a 51% interest.  IBM has a 49% interest.  Under the terms\r\n\nof the Agreement, the Trust contributed the undeveloped parcel at\r\n\n404 Wyman  Street, valued at  $19.3 million,  and IBM  made a  $1\r\n\nmillion  capital  contribution  as  well  as  a  long-term  lease\r\n\ncommitment.   IBM also  agreed to provide  additional capital  as\r\n\nneeded until its equity  reflected its 49% share in  the venture,\r\n\ncreating an approximately $17.5 million  potential obligation for\r\n\nIBM at the outset of  the undertaking.  None of that  capital has\r\n\nbeen contributed to date.\r\n\n     In 1995,  the Trust attempted unsuccessfully  to negotiate a\r\n\nrestructuring of the loan (\"the Note\"), whose remaining principal\r\n\nbalance was about $72 million.  The lenders,2 however, offered to\r\n\nsell  the note  in  its  entirety for  about  $54  million.   IBM\r\n\ncontended  the price was too high and expressed its unwillingness\r\n\nto make the purchase.   Because the offer would expire  soon, the\r\n\nTrust  caused its  corporate affiliate,  Wyman Loan  Corp. (Wyman\r\n\nLoan), to buy the Note and then proposed that it be resold to the\r\n\nPartnership  at its  cost.   IBM  refused to  go  along with  the\r\n\npurchase, prompting the  Trust to file  a demand for  arbitration\r\n\nwith  the American Arbitration  Association.  Two  days later, on\r\n\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     2 By this time, the Note had been transfered to a consortium\r\nof foreign banks, for whom Citicorp served as agent.\r\n\n                               -3-\r\r\n\nJune 14,  1995, IBM sent the  AAA a letter stating  its view that\r\n\nthe issue was not arbitrable under the Partnership Agreement.\r\n\n     The arbitrability  issue  is  rooted  in Exhibit  D  of  the\r\n\nAgreement, which is  titled \"Major Decisions,\" and which sets out\r\n\nseveral categories of significant decisions  that may be made  by\r\n\nthe  Partnership  and  the   procedures  for  reaching  them  and\r\n\nresolving  disputes.  Section A  of the Exhibit  lists five Major\r\n\nDecisions, including  \"acquiring any land or  other real property\r\n\nor any  interest therein . .  . .\"  For  decisions falling within\r\n\nSection A,\r\n\n     (a)  either Partner . . . may withhold its approval for\r\n     any  reason, or for no reason, in its sole and complete\r\n     discretion, without  regard to whether  the withholding\r\n     of such approval is unreasonable or arbitrary . . . .\r\n\nMajor Decisions falling within Section C, by contrast, may not be\r\n\nmade unreasonably or unilaterally  and a deadlock on one  of them\r\n\nwill  trigger the  Agreement's  arbitration provisions.   Section\r\n\nC(13) covers \"refinancing of any part or all of the Project.\"\r\n\n     IBM  contends that  the Note  purchase would  constitute the\r\n\nacquisition  of an interest in  real property, and  thus that its\r\n\nopposition  to the  deal ends  the matter.   The  Trust, however,\r\n\ninsists that the purchase is part of a refinancing.  Although the\r\n\nletter proposing the transaction refers only to the purchase, the\r\n\nTrust  maintains that  the proposal  embraces the  expectation of\r\n\nadded  capital  from  IBM  (consistent  with  the  $17.5  million\r\n\nobligation) and  new third-party  financing of  the balance.   As\r\n\nnoted,  IBM's objection to a refinancing  is arbitrable under the\r\n\nAgreement.\r\n\n                               -4-\r\r\n\n     The district court was  persuaded that the proposed decision\r\n\nto purchase the Note should be categorized as a refinancing under\r\n\nC(13)  of the Agreement.   It was influenced,  inter alia, by the\r                                                                   \r\n\nfact  that  purchase  of the  mortgage  would  not  result in  an\r\n\n\"acquisition\" of  property because the  Partnership already owned\r\n\n404  Wyman Street, and by a belief that no substantive difference\r\n\nexisted  in  this context  between  the proposed  purchase  and a\r\n\nrestructuring  of the original Note, which IBM had conceded would\r\n\nfall within C(13).  See 915 F. Supp. at 496-98.\r                                 \r\n\n     Though these  points have force, we have  concluded that the\r\n\nproposal as presently articulated is not arbitrable.3  We explain\r\n\nour reasoning in the following section.\r\n\n                         II.  Discussion\r                                                  \r\n\n     Our  review of the district  court's grant of  the motion to\r\n\ncompel  arbitration is de novo,  as it involves  the purely legal\r                                        \r\n\ntask  of  interpreting the  Partnership  Agreement.   See,  e.g.,\r                                                                          \r\n\nPaineWebber  Inc. v.  Elahi, 87  F.3d 589,  592 (1st  Cir. 1996);\r                                     \r\n\nCommercial Union Ins. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co., 992 F.2d 386, 388\r                                                        \r\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\r\n\n     One  difficulty in  this  case is  that,  to a  point,  both\r\n\nparties are  right.  Notwithstanding the  district court's effort\r\n\nto  view property ownership in  the \"everyday\" sense, there seems\r\n\nno doubt that the purchase of a mortgage conveys some interest in\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     3  Our  disposition on  the  refinancing  question makes  it\r\nunnecessary to consider IBM's alternative argument that the Trust\r\nis foreclosed from compelling arbitration because it breached its\r\nfiduciary duties to  the Partnership in causing its  affiliate to\r\npurchase the Note.\r\n\n                               -5-\r\r\n\nthe  mortgaged property  to  the  purchaser.   Indeed,  even  the\r\n\ndistrict court acknowledged that a mortgagee has a legal interest\r\n\nin the property secured by the mortgage.  See 915 F. Supp. at 497\r                                                       \r\n\n(\"While the  mortgagee may  technically have  legal title to  the\r\n\nmortgaged property,  the mortgagor  is considered the  'owner' of\r\n\nproperty.\").   See also Maglione v. BancBoston Mortgage Corp., 29\r                                                                       \r\n\nMass. App. Ct. 88, 90, 557 N.E.2d 756, 757 (1990); 7 Mass. Jur.  \r\n\n23:3  at  383 (1993).    Thus,  if  it  purchases the  Note,  the\r\n\nPartnership would  acquire at least  a technical new  interest in\r\n\nthe office building, and the proposal therefore could be  treated\r\n\nas a \"Section A\" major decision.\r\n\n     On  the other  hand,  the proposal  grew out  of refinancing\r\n\nnegotiations.  The offer  by Citicorp and its associates  to sell\r\n\nthe  mortgage back to  the Partnership at  a substantial discount\r\n\ndirectly stemmed  from the  Partnership's efforts  to renegotiate\r\n\nthe terms of its original financing;  the purchase apparently was\r\n\nintended  to  be  part of  an  alternative  method  by which  the\r\n\nPartnership  could restructure  and reduce  its debt.   Thus,  in\r\n\ncontext,  the acquisition  of a property  interest arguably  is a\r\n\nstep  preliminary and  subordinate to  the effort  to refinance.4\r\n\nIndeed,  IBM recognized  both  in a  hearing before  the district\r\n                    \r                              \r\n\n     4  In   fact,  we  acknowledge  the   possibility  that,  in\r\ndesignating the  acquisition  of an  interest  in property  as  a\r\nSection A decision on which the partners had complete discretion,\r\nthe partners  were contemplating  the purchase of  property other\r\nthan  that which  the Partnership  already \"owned.\"   Unlike  the\r\ndistrict court,  however,  see 915  F. Supp.  at 497,  we do  not\r                                        \r\nbelieve the Agreement contains such a limitation and therefore do\r\nnot reject Section A as wholly inapplicable to the acquisition of\r\na mortgage interest.\r\n\n                               -6-\r\r\n\ncourt and in  its briefs  on appeal that  a refinancing  proposal\r\n\nthat  included a  specified amount  of increased  equity probably\r\n\nwould fall under the refinancing provision.  \r\n\n     We  need not at this juncture determine the validity of this\r\n\nproposition, for the proposal was not presented as such.  Instead\r\n\nof recommending  a multi-step  refinancing plan that  begins with\r\n\npurchase of the mortgage,  the Trust has offered a  proposal that\r\n\nmakes  no reference to financing terms.  Although certain details\r\n\nof financing in  so complex  a business environment  may need  to\r\n\nremain imprecise  until the  transaction is close  to completion,\r\n\nthe proposal at the moment lacks any refinancing structure.\r                                              \r\n\n     We acknowledge the Trust's argument that the Agreement fills\r\n\nin  crucial  gaps  through   the  provision  that  governs  IBM's\r\n\nobligation  to contribute  capital  and  another  provision  that\r\n\nrefers generally to the  pursuit of financing from third  parties\r\n\nor partners.   See     3.2(c), 3.3.1.   Even taking  the proposal\r                            \r\n\ntogether  with  the  Agreement,  however, the  recommendation  is\r\n\nwithout substance; it  includes neither the amounts  to be sought\r\n\nfrom lenders nor any other details about possible interest rates,\r\n\nthe  duration of  a mortgage,  how soon  such financing  could or\r\n\nshould be obtained, or the nature of the liability to be assumed.\r\n\nWe conclude that this defect renders resort to C(13) premature.\r\n\n     In sum, though the Trust's proposal to purchase the mortgage\r\n\nforeshadows  a  refinancing scheme,  we hold  that  it is  as yet\r\n\nwithout sufficient  form  to trigger  the arbitration  provision.\r\n\nBecause the  Trust has so  far proposed no  more than a  mortgage\r\n\n                               -7-\r\r\n\nredemption  --   which  would  result,  unquestionably,   in  the\r\n\nacquisition  by the  Partnership of  a greater  interest in  real\r\n\nproperty -- IBM has veto power under Section A of Exhibit D.\r\n\n     We note  that, in  so concluding,  we have credited  neither\r\n\nparty's  assertions concerning the  other's self-serving motives.\r\n\nOur determination that arbitration  may not be compelled at  this\r\n\ntime is based solely on  the Trust's failure to submit  an actual\r\n\nrefinancing plan; we offer no view on the legitimacy of seeking a\r\n\ncapital  contribution  from  IBM  under  section  3.2(c)  of  the\r\n\nAgreement as part of such a plan.\r\n\n     Reversed.\r                       \r\n\n                               -8-\r\r\n",

The Trust, however, insists that the purchase is part of a refinancing.  Although the letter proposing the transaction refers only to the purchase, the Trust maintains that the proposal embraces the expectation of added capital from IBM (consistent with the $17.5 million obligation) and new third-party financing of the balance.

See, e.g., PaineWebber Inc. v. Elahi, 87 F.3d 589, 592 (1st Cir.1996);  Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg.

Notwithstanding the district court's effort to view property ownership in the \"everyday\" sense, there seems no doubt that the purchase of a mortgage conveys some interest in the mortgaged property to the purchaser.  Indeed, even the district court acknowledged that a mortgagee has a legal interest in the property secured by the mortgage.  See 915 F.Supp. at 497 (\"While the mortgagee may technically have legal title to the mortgaged property, the mortgagor is considered the 'owner' of property.\").  See also Maglione v. BancBoston Mortgage Corp., 29 Mass.App.Ct. 88, 90, 557 N.E.2d 756, 757 (1990);  7 Mass.  Jur. &#167; 23:3 at 383 (1993).  Thus, if it purchases the Note, the Partnership would acquire at least a technical new interest in the office building, and the proposal therefore could be treated as a \"Section A\" major decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other hand, the proposal grew out of refinancing negotiations.

Thus, in context, the acquisition of a property interest arguably is a step preliminary and subordinate to the effort to refinance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Indeed, IBM recognized both in a hearing before the district court and in its briefs on appeal that a refinancing proposal that included a specified amount of increased equity probably would fall under the refinancing provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not at this juncture determine the validity of this proposition, for the proposal was not presented as such.  Instead of recommending a multi-step refinancing plan that begins with purchase of the mortgage, the Trust has offered a proposal that makes no reference to financing terms.  Although certain details of financing in so complex a business environment may need to remain imprecise until the transaction is close to completion, the proposal at the moment lacks any refinancing structure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge the Trust's argument that the Agreement fills in crucial gaps through the provision that governs IBM's obligation to contribute capital and another provision that refers generally to the pursuit of financing from third parties or partners.  See &#167;&#167; 3.2(c), 3.3.1.  Even taking the proposal together with the Agreement, however, the recommendation is without substance;  it includes neither the amounts to be sought from lenders nor any other details about possible interest rates, the duration of a mortgage, how soon such financing could or should be obtained, or the nature of the liability to be assumed.

The Trust secured an opportunity for the Partnership to reduce its debt by purchasing its own mortgage at a substantial discount.  IBM opposed the deal.  The issue before us is whether IBM's veto is absolute, or whether the dispute must be arbitrated;  under the Partnership Agreement, the answer turns on whether the proposal involves an acquisition of \"an interest in real property\" or a \"refinancing.\"   The district court deemed it a refinancing, and granted the Trust's motion to compel arbitration.  See Bank v. International Business Machines Corp., <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></span>, 498 (D.Mass.1996).  The issue is close, but we conclude that the refinancing provision is inapplicable because the proposal that has been presented so far lacks refinancing content.  Consequently, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">IBM and the Trust entered into the Partnership in October 1986.  The Partnership Agreement specifies that the Partnership would seek to finance the construction and operation of the office building with a non-recourse loan, and a $75 million loan imposing no liability on either party for repayment of the principal was, in fact, obtained from Citicorp Real Estate, Inc.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Trust is the managing partner of the Partnership, holding a 51% interest.  IBM has a 49% interest.  Under the terms of the Agreement, the Trust contributed the undeveloped parcel at 404 Wyman Street, valued at $19.3 million, and IBM made a $1 million capital contribution as well as a long-term lease commitment.  IBM also agreed to provide additional capital as needed until its equity reflected its 49% share in the venture, creating an approximately $17.5 million potential obligation for IBM at the outset of the undertaking.  None of that capital has been contributed to date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, the Trust attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate a restructuring of the loan (\"the Note\"), whose remaining principal balance was about $72 million.  The lenders,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> however, offered to sell the note in its entirety for about $54 million.  IBM contended the price was too high and expressed its unwillingness to make the purchase.  Because the offer would expire soon, the Trust caused its corporate affiliate, Wyman Loan Corp.  (Wyman Loan), to buy the Note and then proposed that it be resold to the Partnership at its cost.  IBM refused to go along with the purchase, prompting the Trust to file a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association.  Two days later, on June 14, 1995, IBM sent the AAA a letter stating its view that the issue was not arbitrable under the Partnership Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The arbitrability issue is rooted in Exhibit D of the Agreement, which is titled \"Major Decisions,\" and which sets out several categories of significant decisions that may be made by the Partnership and the procedures for reaching them and resolving disputes.  Section A of the Exhibit lists five Major Decisions, including \"acquiring any land or other real property or any interest therein....\"  For decisions falling within Section A,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p>(a) either Partner ... may withhold its approval for any reason, or for no reason, in its sole and complete discretion, without regard to whether the withholding of such approval is unreasonable or arbitrary....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Major Decisions falling within Section C, by contrast, may not be made unreasonably or unilaterally and a deadlock on one of them will trigger the Agreement's arbitration provisions.
